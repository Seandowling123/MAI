Jun 18, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate 
ReleaseChicago, IL - June 18, 2020 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every 
day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial 
markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Airlines AAL[1], Delta Air Lines DAL[2], Southwest 
Airlines LUV[3], United Airlines UAL[4] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5].Here are highlights from Wednesday's 
Analyst Blog: Airline Industry Soars 50%+ in a Month: More Room to Rally?After being on the receiving end of the 
pandemic crisis that bottled-up air-travel demand, stocks in the airline space finally have something to cheer about. 
Recently, many aviation stocks issued bullish updates on the back of an improved air-travel demand scenario. The 
buoyancy is evident from the fact that the ZacksAirline[6]industry has gained 50.8% in the past month compared 
with the S&#38;P 500 Index's mere 3.8% rise.Reasons for This ResurgenceReopening of businesses in countries 
around the globe and easing of travel bans bode well for the airline stocks, which are witnessing a surge in new 
bookings. Evidently, American Airlines saw 60% growth in July bookings on a year-over-year basis.Management at 
American Airlines stated that it intends to operate 55% of its scheduled domestic flights in July 2020 compared with 
the capacity recorded in July 2019. Evidently, the company flew nearly 110,000 passengers per day, on average, in 
the last week of May, up 71% from the April reading. Moreover, American Airlines aims to operate nearly 20% of its 
internal flights scheduled for July compared with the last-year level.Also, owing to the recent uptick in air-travel 
demand alongside cost-cutting initiatives, the carrier projects its cash-burn rate to fall to nearly $40 million per day 
in June from $100 million in April. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company hopes to reduce its cash-burn rate to 
zero by Dec 31, 2020. Delta Air Lines too expects to lower its average daily cash outflow to zero by 2020 end. 
Moreover, this Atlanta, GA-based carrier predicts the demand-recovery landscape to be healthier on the domestic 
front than in the international markets. As a result, it added 100 domestic flights in June.Moreover, the company 
plans to continue extending the flight fleet in the third quarter. Further, Southwest Airlines boosted itsJune schedule 
by 27%[7]from the May reading. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks 
here[8].Additionally, the cost-controlling initiatives of airlines are supporting bottom-line growth in the current 
environment of depressed revenues. Evidently, owing to its cost-saving measures, United Airlines expects second-
quarter operating expenses to decrease 53% year over year.Another factor working in favor of the airlines in this 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and 
Ryanair
otherwise economic gloom is their focus on operating cargo-only flights. Understandably, the cargo business unit of 
Latin American carrier Azul registered a 36% increase in first-quarter 2020 revenues. Backed by its concentration 
on cargo-only flights to offset passenger revenue weakness, United Airlines expects the same to surge more than 
30% year over year in the June quarter.Therelaxation of restrictions[9]on flights connecting the United States with 
China is another positive. Notably, the likes of Delta and United Airlines aim to resume operations on the U.S.-
China routes shortly.The Road AheadAlthough the recent rally in airline stocks owing to the above-mentioned 
tailwinds looks impressive, the million-dollar question is whether this uptick is sustainable. Fears over a second 
wave of coronavirus are a major headwind. In fact, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings' CEO Michael 
O'Leary recently stated that even though he expects the carrier to be profitable in fiscal 2022 (ending Mar 31, 
2022), 'Everything will depend on how people will fly between September and March and that there is no second-
wave outbreak'.However, one thing is certain that demand will not rebound to pre-coronavirus levels anytime soon. 
Per the International Air Transport Association[10](IATA), the aviation industry is estimated to suffer loses to the 
tune of $84.3 billion in the current year due to the coronavirus woes.However, the forecast seems brighter for 2021 
with total loss for the industry likely to be narrower at $15.8 billion.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it 
generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed 
investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of money for 
regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend  > >[11]Media

Jun 18, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  French finance minister Bruno Le 
Maire on Thursday urged Air France not to make mandatory job cuts. Le Maire said he wished that any job losses 
at Air France represent less than 8,000 posts: 'Readjustments will be necessary for Air France. What I am asking of 
Air France is that there should be no forced redundancies', he said. His comments come amid media reports that 
the airline was planning to cut more than 8,000 jobs, based on voluntary departures. In April, Air France received €7 
billion in French government aid. CEO Ben Smith in May announced a 20% cut to structural capacity, which 
potentially affects some 9,000 of its 45,000 jobs. Other airlines are reducing staff as well amid the coronavirus 
crisis. British Airways is cutting 12,000 jobs, Ryanair is cutting at least 3,000, while Lufthansa is seeking as many as 
22,000 departures.

Armchair travellers intent on visiting Great Britain can use the national tourism agency website to download recipes 
for lemon lavender shortbread, take a virtual tour of Harry Potter locations and shuffle a thoroughly British playlist. 
Piquantly, this includes The Clash's 1980s anthem "Should I Stay or Should I Go?" What they cannot do, under 
current rules, is fly to the country without a two-week quarantine. That - unsurprisingly - has irked British Airways 
and Ryanair as well as easyJet which has resumed flights this week. Similar restrictions elsewhere have stymied 
visitor flows, dealing a blow to the $3tn global tourism industry.
The UK government may quell the rebellion by exempting destinations favoured by Brits from quarantine rules. This 
does not solve the travel industry's real problem - the natural risk aversion of consumers. Tourism is an up-close 
and personal business of crowded souks, beach massages and island raves. It does not fit well within a social 
distanced world.
Snapshots show an industry trying to reinvent itself. Some have little choice. Thailand, which relies on tourism for 
almost a fifth of its economy, will end its ban on incoming international flights at the end of the month.
Hoteliers are putting the focus on upmarket holidays - single-unit villas are attractive when you want to minimise 
contact - and local travel.
Vietnam has revived an old mantra of "Vietnamese travel in Vietnam". Hotels across Asia are luring locals into 
discounted staycations or weekends.
In some cities, hotels recasting themselves as quarantine specialists are doing a roaring trade. In Auckland, where 
the average length of stay a year ago was under two nights, hoteliers are now hosting guests who stay for a

minimum 14 days. In China, where the InterContinental Hotel Group, Marriott and Accor chains are mostly back in 
business, occupancy rates were last month around 50 per cent, according to data consultancy STR.
Tourism is a huge part of many economies. All told, tourism is responsible for one in 10 jobs globally, says the 
World Tourism & Travel Council. Even in the UK, the sector generated £200bn last year.
Rows over rules to reduce infection will recur. But with second waves of infection appearing, the wariness of holiday 
makers will damage revenues more than travel restrictions.

Rows over rules to reduce infection will recur. But with second waves of infection appearing, the wariness of holiday 
makers will damage revenues more than travel restrictions.

Armchair travellers intent on visiting Great Britain can use the national tourism agency website to download recipes

Piquantly, this includes The Clash's 1980s anthem "Should I Stay or Should I Go?" What they cannot do, under 
current rules, is fly to the country without a two-week quarantine. That - unsurprisingly - has irked British Airways 
and Ryanair as well as easyJet which has resumed flights this week. Similar restrictions elsewhere have stymied 
visitor flows, dealing a blow to the $3tn global tourism industry.
The UK government may quell the rebellion by exempting destinations favoured by Brits from quarantine rules. This 
does not solve the travel industry's real problem - the natural risk aversion of consumers. Tourism is an up-close 
and personal business of crowded souks, beach massages and island raves. It does not fit well within a social 
distanced world.
Snapshots show an industry trying to reinvent itself. Some have little choice. Thailand, which relies on tourism for 
almost a fifth of its economy, will end its ban on incoming international flights at the end of the month.

Jun 17, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  British airline EasyJet said it had 
pushed back the delivery of 24 aircraft to between 2025 and 2027 because of the coronavirus crisis. The airline 
earlier said it is not expecting travel demand to recover to its pre-crisis levels until 2023. The company employed 
15,000 people at the beginning of the year. In May it needed to cut 4,500 jobs, or 30% of its workforce[1]. It has 
also secured additional flexibility on orders from planemaker Airbus as part of its planning for a smaller travel 
market. The deal gives EasyJet the option to cancel up to seven aircraft currently scheduled for delivery between 
2022 and 2026. In March, the airline grounded its entire fleet[2] as a response to the global travel bans aimed at 
containing the coronavirus pandemic. On Monday, its planes started flying a minimal service. Last month, the UK 
government announced that, from June 8, all international arrivals, including returning Britons, will have to self-
isolate and provide details of where they will be staying. The aviation industry condemned the move[3]. EasyJet, 
together with Ryanair and British Airways, has written to the government applying for a judicial review, complaining 
that the quarantine rules are disproportionate. [ 1]:

Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, has rejected the UK Government's 14 day quarantine as ineffective and 
useless. For a quarantine to be effective, inbound passengers arriving at ports and airports need to be "detained" at 
their point of arrival. The UK Government however proposes to collect mobile phone numbers from inbound visitors 
but then allow them to travel on the London underground, the Heathrow Express, the Gatwick Express, the bus 
network, and/or taxis to and from London, and to/from every other airport in the UK.
Any inbound visitors could therefore spread the COVID-19 virus on public transport across London, and in every 
other major UK city with an airport, before arriving at their "quarantine address".
Once they have arrived at their "quarantine address", the UK Government will phone less than 1% of these visitors 
but only on their mobile phone, which can be answered from any golf course, beach, park or indeed supermarket 
across the UK, thereby rendering this quarantine utterly ineffective and useless.
For the UK to be imposing a 14 day quarantine on inbound visitors when it already has one of the worst COVID 
infection and death rates in Europe, is closing the door long after the horse has bolted. Most visitors to the UK from 
Europe are arriving from countries with a lower R rate than the UK, which renders this 14 day quarantine not just 
ineffective and useless, but far too little far too late.
A spokesperson for Ryanair stated: "This 14 day UK quarantine is ineffective, completely useless, and will have no 
effect on British passengers who will largely ignore it. At a time when the medical science across Europe, in 
countries such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and Germany, have safely removed all inbound visitor restrictions, the 
imposition of this completely defective quarantine in the UK is utterly useless and a total waste of time.
Ryanair is going back flying on 1 July with 1,000 daily flights from most UK airports, and we look forward to 
welcoming thousands of UK visitors going on their well-earned summer holidays to Portugal, Spain, France and 
Italy, and we are equally confident that inbound visitors to the UK will not be deterred by this completely ineffective 
and useless quarantine measure, which both Priti Patel and Grant Shapps know cannot be implemented, cannot be 
policed and has no scientific basis supporting it whatsoever."

British Airways, Ryanair, and easyJet have initiated joint legal proceedings against the United Kingdom government 
in which they are seeking to overturn its recently implemented quarantine rules, British Airways' parent IAG 
International Airlines Group said in a statement. The three carriers said they had requested the UK High Court to 
urgently review the new policy, which took effect on June 8, and to order the government to demonstrate that the 
policy has scientific justification. According to the airlines, there is no such justification. In addition, the airlines 
allege that the policy was introduced with no consultation with the industry. The British government did not 
immediately respond to the challenge. The UK introduced a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all travellers arriving 
from abroad starting on June 8, almost three months after most European countries started introducing travel 
restrictions and mandatory quarantines to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of mid-June, most EU 
states have reduced or even abolished restrictions in relation to travellers within the bloc. According to the airlines, 
the "flawed" policy will have "a devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy". The airlines also said 
that the proposed "air bridges" between the UK and countries with lower infection rates are not well defined and it is 
unclear how they would operate in practice.

A recent statement by Micael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair hinted that the airline may well readjust its fleet to focus on 
a single type.
In 2018 the Ryanair Group purchased Lauda, an Austrian LCC, intending to shift away from operating an 
exclusively Boeing fleet. Ryanair's fleet consists of more than 400 Boeing 737s, while Lauda operated 30 Airbus 
A320s. After the delays with the Boeing 737 MAX, the airline considered ordering the Airbus A321. But, now the 
O'Leary revealed that the idea of a mixed Boeing - Airbus fleet will likely be dropped. In an interview with Reuters, 
O'Leary said that negotiations with Airbus were "a waste of time".
"We have [Airbus] aircraft that are due to be delivered over the next 12 months and we will cancel almost all of 
those deliveries, which are from leasing companies", Reuters quoted O'Leary as saying.
If Boeing and Ryanair reach an agreement over the MAX deliveries, it may well mean that some of the 200 737 
MAX aircraft could be used to replace the Airbus types currently used on Lauda's fleet.

"We have [Airbus] aircraft that are due to be delivered over the next 12 months and we will cancel almost all of 
those deliveries, which are from leasing companies", Reuters quoted O'Leary as saying.
If Boeing and Ryanair reach an agreement over the MAX deliveries, it may well mean that some of the 200 737 
MAX aircraft could be used to replace the Airbus types currently used on Lauda's fleet.

A recent statement by Micael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair hinted that the airline may well readjust its fleet to focus on 
a single type.
In 2018 the Ryanair Group purchased Lauda, an Austrian LCC, intending to shift away from operating an 
exclusively Boeing fleet. Ryanair's fleet consists of more than 400 Boeing 737s, while Lauda operated 30 Airbus 
A320s. After the delays with the Boeing 737 MAX, the airline considered ordering the Airbus A321. But, now the 
O'Leary revealed that the idea of a mixed Boeing - Airbus fleet will likely be dropped. In an interview with Reuters, 
O'Leary said that negotiations with Airbus were "a waste of time".
"We have [Airbus] aircraft that are due to be delivered over the next 12 months and we will cancel almost all of 
those deliveries, which are from leasing companies", Reuters quoted O'Leary as saying.
If Boeing and Ryanair reach an agreement over the MAX deliveries, it may well mean that some of the 200 737

IAG owner British Airways has hinted that it may consider legal action over the UK's planned quarantine rules set to 
begin on Monday. The group's CEO Willie Walsh, made the comment this morning.
Under the UK's ruling, passengers returning to the UK will have to undergo a two-week self quarantine with all but 
essential travel being allowed. Any holidaymakers will have to add a further 14 days on to any time taken when they 
return. This will also extend to any overseas business meetings, even if they are a simple day trip.
The UK's aviation industry is unsatisfied and IAG has joined calls against the quarantine stating in a letter to MPs 
that the new procedure will "torpedo" the airline's planned July recovery during this unique circumstances.
According to simpleflying.com, IAG CEO and former British Airways CEO, Willie Walsh wrote in a letter to the MPs 
stating:
"British Airways had hoped to operate about 40% of our scheduled flights in July but this has been torpedoed by the 
introduction of the 14-day quarantine period for people arriving in the UK."
Ryanair has also announced that it will support any legal action launched by the IAG against the UK's "ineffective 
and useless quarantine."

Jun 16, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Airlines are limiting 
alcohol sales as they begin to welcome back more passengers.The decision is intended to further limit the exposure 
of cabin crew to passengers.Passengers flying on domestic flights will be the most affected with international flights 
largely keeping their alcoholic offerings.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Airports bars are 
about to get more crowded.The world's airlines are adjusting their in-flight offerings as they begin to welcome more 
passengers and for some, begin operations again for the first time in months. Each airline is approaching the task 
differently in an attempt to reduce the exposure of flight crew to passengers but one common approach is limiting 
alcohol sales to passengers, according to CNN[2].The two largest airlines in the US — Delta and American — are 
not offering alcohol to economy passengers on domestic flights, CNN[3] reported. American[4] will serve alcohol on 
request to first-class passengers when flying domestically while Delta[5] will not.As Business Insider found on 
recent domestic flights[6], American is completely restricting its economy in-flight service on domestic flights to "on 
request" and Delta is providing passengers with a sealed plastic bag containing a water bottle, snacks, napkin, and 
single-serving packet of hand sanitizer. 
Both will serve alcoholic beverages in all cabins on long-haul international flights.In the US, it's illegal for 
passengers to consume alcohol not served by flight attendants. The fine for doing so, Business Insider[7] reported, 
can be up to $11,000.In Europe, some of the continent's largest airlines are also scaling back on alcohol, according 
to CNN[8], including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, EasyJet, and Ryanair.British Airways 
will only be suspending alcohol sales in short-haul economy, according to its website[9], while Virgin Atlantic is 
completely suspending alcohol service on its flights, CNN[10] reported. Read the original article on Business

Jun 16, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
American Airlines AAL[1] grabbed headlines following the announcement that it hopes to reduce its cash burn rate 
to zero by Dec 31, 2020. Notably, the carrier was also in news in the previous week[2] when it issued a bullish 
update on July capacity.Per Delta Air Lines DAL[3] management, the second-quarter 2020 top line is expected to 
plunge 90% year over year, mainly due to the coronavirus-induced passenger revenue slump. Echoing similar 
sentiments, United Airlines UAL[4] anticipates an 88% year-over-year reduction in second-quarter total 
revenues.Meanwhile, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] CEO Michael O'Leary reportedly 
[6]said that the airline will incur a net loss in the band of €200-€300 million ($226-$339 million) for fiscal year 2021 
(ending Mar 31, 2021).Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories1. American Airlines predicts second-
quarter 2020 revenues to tank approximately 90% year over year. Capacity in the period is expected to plummet 
roughly 75% year over year. However, owing to the recent improvement in air-travel demand alongside cost-cutting 
initiatives, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) projects cash-burn rate to fall to nearly $40 million per day in June [7]from 
$100 million in April. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[8]2 Like American Airlines, Delta 
hopes to reduce its average daily cash outflow to zero by 2020-end. Moreover, this Atlanta, GA-based carrier 
envisions the demand-recovery environment to be better on the domestic front than in the international markets. As 
a result, the carrier added 100 domestic flights in June. Moreover, it plans to continue adding flights in the third 
quarter[9].3. Backed by its focus on operating cargo-only flights as passenger revenues decline in the current 
scenario, United Airlines expects cargo revenues to surge more than 30% year over year in the June quarter. 
Additionally, owing to its cost-cutting measures, this Chicago-based carrier expects second-quarter operating 
expenses to decrease 53% year over year. Moreover, second-quarter average daily cash-burn amount is expected 
to be at the lower end of the $40-$45 million guided range. In the third quarter, the same is forecast at almost $30 
million per day. The company is focused on achieving capital expenditure savings of more than $2.5 billion for the 
full year, which will lower its capital budget to below $4.5 billion. Moreover, United Airlines expects to end the third 
quarter of 2020 with total liquidity worth $17 billion.4. Driven by its cost-controlling initiatives, Ryanair reduced its 
average weekly cash-burn rate to around €60 million in May from approximately €200 million in March. Additionally, 
the carrier expects to rebound from a forgettable fiscal 2021 to be profitable in fiscal 2022. However, O'Leary said

that 'Everything will depend on how people will fly between September and March and that there is no second-wave 
outbreak'.5. With the coronavirus pandemic disrupting air-travel demand, LATAM Airlines' LTM[10] May traffic dived 
96.5% on a year-over-year basis. As this Latin American carrier trimmed capacity to cope with the bleak demand 
scenario, consolidated capacity (measured in available seat miles/ASMs) contracted 93.3%. Meanwhile,

UK Parliament Calls British Airways 'National Disgrace' Over Planned Redundancies; IAG Falls 5%
UK Parliament Calls British Airways 'National Disgrace' Over Planned 
Redundancies; IAG Falls 5%

 UK members of parliament labeled British Airways' treatment of its staff a "national disgrace" after it announced a 
plan to make 12,000 jobs redundant during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The aviation sector has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, forcing other airlines such as easyJet (EZJ.L), 
Ryanair (RYA.L) and Virgin Atlantic to propose thousands of job cuts to soften the blow of the crisis.
A transport select committee report published Saturday singled out British Airways and its parent International 
Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG.L) over their "fire and rehire" strategy, under which they reportedly threatened to 
fire staff and rehire them on lower pay.
In the report, the transport committee called the airline's consultation on staffing changes, due to end Monday, a 
"calculated attempt to take advantage of the pandemic" to lay off 12,000 staff and downgrade the employment 
terms of about 35,000.
Commenting on the report, Huw Merriman, chair of the transport committee, said British Airways and IAG's 
behavior "falls well below the standards expected from any employer, especially in light of the scale of taxpayer 
subsidy, at this time of national crisis."
Merriman also warned that the planned job cuts "cannot appear to go without sanction" by the government, 
members of parliament or paying travelers "who may choose differently in future."
Parliament members urged airlines to delay their proposed redundancies until the furlough scheme ends in October 
and they have had the opportunity to mull over the government's plans to help the industry "restart and recover."
In addition to the job cuts, the committee also criticized the government's 14-day quarantine requirement for 
travelers arriving in the UK, saying the rule would damage the aviation sector and the wider economy.
UK Parliament Calls British Airways 'National Disgrace' Over Planned Redundancies; IAG Falls 5%
The committee called on the government to end the quarantine policy at the end of June in favor of a "more flexible 
and risk-based approach to border control." The alternatives include targeted quarantines, temperature screening 
and so-called air bridges, which would allow tourists between two countries to visit without the need to quarantine.
The report came after British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair on Friday sued the government to overturn the 
quarantine rule, which they said would hamper bookings. The airlines also argued there is no scientific evidence for 
the quarantine period and sought a judicial review as soon as possible.
As of Monday morning, IAG shares were down nearly 5% and easyJet and Ryanair lost roughly 3%.

Jun 15, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of C.H. Robinson 
Worldwide CHRW[1] have lost 5.6% in the past year against the industry[2]'s 3.8% growth.Let's delve deeper to 
unearth the reasons for such a disappointing price performance.C.H. Robinson is taking a hit from the lackluster 
freight scenario in the United states. The company is seeing softness in truckload volumes due to weak freight 
market conditions. Due to depressing freight conditions, the company's earnings missed estimates in three of the 
last four quarters, surpassing the same on a single occasion. 
The average negative surprise is 13.04%.The already bleak volume scenario due to freight sluggishness is 
aggravated by the coronavirus crisis, which induced supply-chain disruptions. Moreover, amid the economic 
downturn, high capital expenditures may further impede prospects in the near term by limiting bottom-line growth. 
Despite several adversities, the company continues to project capital expenses of $60-$70 million for 
2020.Additionally, the company's total debt to total capital ratio stood at 0.47 at the end of the first quarter of 2020, 
comparing unfavorably with the reading of 0.42 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. The increasing debt-to-
capitalization ratio indicates that the proportion of debt to finance the company's assets is on the rise. Moreover, 
C.H. Robinson exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $295 million, way below the current debt 
figure of $373 million, implying that the company lacks enough cash in hand to meet even its current debt 
obligations.Estimate Revision &#38; Momentum ScoreThe fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 
earnings has been revised 16.9% downward over the past 60 days, is indicative of the pessimism surrounding this 
Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. Moreover, the stock has a Momentum Score[3] of C, highlighting its short-term 
unattractiveness.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation[4] sector are Air Lease 
Corporation AL[5], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] and Teekay Tankers Ltd. TNK[7], all currently carrying a Zacks 
Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[8]Long-term 
earnings (three to five years) growth rate for Air Lease, Ryanair Holdings and Teekay Tankers is estimated at 3.1%, 
20.5% and 3%, respectively.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all

Jun 15, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We recently issued an 
updated report on Union Pacific Corporation UNP[1].Like many other transportation companies, Union Pacific is hit 
by uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic.The coronavirus outbreak caused disruptions in China's supply 
chain starting in mid-February followed by the closure of the U.S. automotive plants in March-end. Both freight 
revenues and volumes declined during the first quarter. The impact is likely to be more negative in the second 
quarter, where volumes are anticipated to plunge approximately 20%. Due to the bleak volume projection, operating 
ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) will not improve in the second quarter on a year-over-year 
basis, despite cost-cutting measures. Also, due to the COVID-related uncertainty, Union Pacific withdrew its 2020 
guidance with respect to operating ratio, headcount, volumes and buybacks.High-debt levels are also worrisome. 
Union Pacific's debt/EBITDA ratio (adjusted) increased to 2.5 at the end of 2019 and 2.7 at the end of first-quarter 
2020. A high debt/EBITDA ratio often indicates that a firm may be unable to service its debt appropriately.However, 
the company's cost cutting strategies are impressive. In first-quarter 2020, the bottom line improved 11.4% on a 
year-over-year basis, primarily due to low costs. Operating expenses contracted 10% to $3,086 million. Additionally, 
operating income in the first quarter increased 9% year over year to $2,143 million.Though the company withdrew 
its guidance for share buybacks, it continues to pay out dividends. This signifies its financial strength. Union pacific 
intends to mainatin its dividend payout ratio between 40% and 45% in the long term. Moreover, its ability to 
generate free cash flow ($688 million in the first quarter, up 25% year over year) is a positive and supports its 
dividend-paying capacity.Union Pacific Corporation Price https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/UNP/price?icid=chart-

Poll: Support for Britain's coronavirus response falls to 30 per cent

Only 30 per cent of voters are satisfied with the British government's response to the coronavirus pandemic, which 
has seen the country record Europe's highest death toll, according to a poll published on Sunday.
The Opinium poll for The Observer found that "discontent at the government's corona handling continues to steadily 
rise," reaching a high of 48 per cent, while approval of the government's approach fell from 34 per cent earlier this 
month.
"This gives the government a net approval rating of minus 18 in responding to one of the greatest threats this 
country has faced," Opinium said.
In another poll published by ORB International on Friday, 52 per cent disagreed with the statement that the 
government was "handling the coronavirus well," while 40 per cent agreed with it.
Britain's official death toll linked to the coronavirus pandemic is more than 40,000, but health data analysts estimate 
the true death toll at up to 70,000, based on seasonal excess deaths.
Health experts and opposition politicians have accused Johnson's government of a slow response to the crisis, and 
criticized Britain's low level of testing and poor preparation for a pandemic.
Johnson is also under pressure from critics who want him to lift Britain's lockdown more quickly to reduce the 
anticipated severe economic impact.
British Airways, Ryanair and easyJet launched legal action on Friday against his requirement for all international 
arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days to curb the spread of coronavirus, warning that it will have "a devastating effect" 
on the economy.

U.K. Transport Committee : British Airways ' Treatment Of Employees 'national Disgrace'
U.K. Transport Committee : British Airways' Treatment Of Employees 
'national Disgrace'

       U.K. Transport Select Committee report condemned behaviour of British Airways and its parent company, IAG 
towards its employees during the coronavirus crisis. British Airways' treatment of its employees during the crisis "is 
a national disgrace", the Committee report claimed.
 The Committee report accused the airline of a "calculated attempt to take advantage" of the pandemic to cut 
12,000 jobs and to downgrade the terms and conditions of about 35,000 employees.
 Meanwhile, British Airways reportedly said that it will do everything in its power to ensure that the company can 
survive and sustain the maximum number of jobs consistent with the new reality of a changed airline industry in a 
severely weakened global economy.
 The aviation industry has been one of the hardest-hit since the pandemic forced a lockdown. Airlines including 
EasyJet, Ryanair, and Virgin Atlantic, and suppliers Rolls-Royce and Airbus, announced thousands of job cuts.
 Chairman of the Transport Committee, Huw Merriman MP, said that the impact of coronavirus may sadly mean that 
the loss of some jobs in the aviation sector is justified. But, the behaviour of British Airways and its parent company, 
IAG, is not.
 British Airways' actions falls well below the standards expected from any employer, especially in light of the scale 
of taxpayer subsidy, at this time of national crisis, Huw Merriman said in the report.
 The U.K. Committee urged UK-based airlines and other aviation employers should not proceed hastily with large 
scale redundancies and restructuring to employees' terms and conditions until the Job Retention Scheme ends in 
October 2020 and they have had the opportunity to consider the Government's plans to help the sector restart and 
recover. 
U.K. Transport Committee : British Airways ' Treatment Of Employees 'national Disgrace'
 The introduction of mandatory 14-day quarantine for travellers to the UK from other countries will damage the 
recovery of the sector and the wider economy, the U.K. Committee's report said.
 On Friday, British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair launched legal action against the U.K. Government over its 
mandatory 14-day quarantine policy.

Carriers launch legal action on quarantine Airlines ; Group says new two-week rule will have 'devastating effect

Carriers launch legal action on quarantine; Airlines ; Group says new two-
week rule will have 'devastating effect on British tourism'

British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair are pushing ahead with legal action against the UK government over the 
introduction of its two-week quarantine period on travellers entering Britain.
The group filed legal papers on Thursday at the High Court, just days after the new quarantine rules came into 
effect. They have asked for their judicial review to be heard as soon as possible.
The three airlines yesterday said they had launched their action against the government's "flawed quarantine", 
which they have claimed would have a "devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy" as well as 
destroying thousands of jobs.
Many in the travel industry have called on the government to introduce a system of "air bridges" or "travel 
corridors", which would enable people to travel between two countries with similar levels of coronavirus infection 
without the need to quarantine. Turkey, Greece and Portugal are among the holiday destinations that have 
indicated a willingness to strike such a deal, even though the UK continues to have relatively high coronavirus 
infection rates. The UK's three biggest airlines said that there was so far no "evidence on how and when proposed 
'air bridges' between the UK and other countries will be implemented".
The group wants the government to readopt its previous quarantine policy introduced on March 10, where the 
restrictions were limited to passengers from "high risk" countries. This would be the "most practical and effective 
Carriers launch legal action on quarantine Airlines ; Group says new two-week rule will have 'devastating effect 
on British tourism'
solution" and would bring the UK in line with much of Europe which is opening its borders this month, the airlines 
said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted that quarantine rules are necessary to "manage the risk of imported 
cases triggering a second peak".
The airlines said in a pre-action letter that ministers acted unlawfully by imposing the restrictions. The move was 
"disproportionate" and would destroy attempts to rebuild their businesses.
In April, global air travel hit a low point, with passenger levels about 95 per cent below 2019 levels. Earlier this 
week, Iata, the global airline trade body, warned that the sector was facing a record loss of $84.3bn this year.

M ike and Christine, a couple from the English Midlands, had agreed the sale and paid the deposit on a beautiful 
villa in Vence, between Nice and Cannes. They had even bought a car to drive in France.
The day after they signed the contract, however, all over-70s were told to self-isolate at home by the UK 
government to minimise their risk of catching Covid-19. The couple - who did not want to give their real names - got 
cold feet and pulled out of the deal.
Like those of many people, Mike and Christine's plans for buying a second home in warmer climes were thwarted 
by coronavirus, which has led to travel restrictions and lockdowns all over the world - and brought international 
property transactions to a halt. The couple say they are now taking time to reassess their options. It is not 
necessarily a bad thing that they pulled out of the deal: with the pound regaining some strength against the euro 
since the middle of March, by mid-April the property would have been £87,000 cheaper, thanks to the exchange 
rate.
"I am still confident we will get this one over the line, when the time's right," says their broker, Serge Cowen, 
founder of the Unique Living Network, which sells luxury property around the world.
Your place in the sun International property With lockdown easing and discounts increasing - is now the time to 
buy a holiday home? By Aleksandra Wisniewska ; Y....
Judging when might be the right time to invest in an overseas property is difficult. With airline fleets grounded 
globally and countries imposing - or considering imposing - extended quarantine periods for travellers, what will 
happen to the international holiday-home market this year? Will 2020 see deals dry up - or is now the time to buy a 
beautiful Tuscan villa at a bargain price? Grounded ambition Closed borders and travel bans have meant that the 
number of flights operating are well below usual volumes. As of the beginning of June, some European countries 
were recording a decline in traffic of more than 90 per cent, according to OAG, a consultancy tracking flights around 
the world.
This is beginning to change, however. Some budget airlines, such as Ryanair and Easyjet, are expected to resume 
flights this month or next - albeit at a significantly reduced capacity. British Airways is planning to restart a large 
number of flights in July. Air France is aiming for a gradual increase from this month.
With the possibility of special noquarantine agreements - so called "travel corridors" between the UK and certain 
Mediterranean resorts - this may be the saving grace for investors who, in the past few months, have seen property 
bookings "fall off the cliff", according to Robert Green, founder of Sphere Estates, which sells and rents luxury 
homes.
"The first half of this year is probably a write-off," he says. It will take months before normality returns, especially if 
UK holidaymakers will be put off by the prospect of spending two weeks in quarantine when they return - as current 
government policy dictates.
Short-term rental landlords will see reduced yields this year, as hosts struggle to fill their homes. "For two months 
we had zero reservations and zero revenue, and all our apartments stood empty," says Adriano Frigoli, founder of 
Nativo, a company that manages high-end Airbnb properties mostly in Milan and Madrid.
Since mid-May bookings have started again and in Milan, where the outbreak hit earlier than in Madrid, they are at 
80 per cent occupancy. "But the revenue is totally different, at 50-60 per cent of what it used to be," he says.
Airbnb has announced it will be scaling back its high-end short-break service, Airbnb Luxe, as the company - which 
is to make a quarter of its workforce redundant - adjusts to economic slowdown in response to the outbreakrelated 
slowdown.
"We probably won't know the full picture [for occupancy rates] until the end of August," says Green. "But some hotel 
industry experts do not expect a full recovery until at least 2023."
For buyers, viewing potential holiday homes has become almost impossible, as even private-jet travel depends on 
reopening borders. Despite some initial excitement from estate agents, only a few wealthy people have been willing 
to buy based on virtual viewings or live walk-throughs.
"We have managed to agree a small number of sales in this period, predominantly with clients who viewed before 
the lockdown," says Tim Swannie, director of buying agent Home Hunts.
Pent-up demand Despite the difficulty in visiting and buying during lockdown, potential buyers have still been 
searching for holiday homes. While a lot of this might be put down to idle scrolling, some agents believe it is a sign 
of pent-up demand.
Swannie says that compared with the same period last year, inquiries at Home Hunts were down only about 12-15 
per cent during lockdown, "which we have found quite encouraging. Over the past 10 days, inquiries Continued on 
page 2 Continued from page 1 [in France] have increased quite dramatically, particularly from UK and European 
buyers," he adds. "It feels like it is going to be a busy summer."
Miles, who did not want to give his real name, is among those expected to seal the deal in the next couple of 
months. He intends to purchase a three-bedroom villa at the Soneva Jani resort in the Maldives. The villa sits

directly on the water on stilts and decking. Miles had been searching for the right property in the Maldives ever 
since he and his partner took a trip there several years ago.
"It ticks all our boxes," he says, adding that he is hoping to earn money by renting it out as a short-term let when not 
using it. He is now consulting tax advisers and hoping to finalise the purchase in July. He believes he can buy the 
villa for $6m, reduced from a guide price of $6.5m.
Green expects that transactions will surge once the restrictions are lifted and people are free to move around again, 
and then stabilise. He says many potential buyers now inquire about fast internet connection, private outdoor space 
and extra room for incorporating a home office. Portugal's Algarve, the south of France and the Alps have been the 
destinations with the most interest, as they are easily accessible by car from the UK or elsewhere in Europe.
"People want to be able to run business from there," he says, adding that second-home buyers are starting to think 
about using the properties for longer periods. "I do see people working from different parts of Europe especially.
They own five or six homes and work from wherever," he adds.
Risk or opportunity? Chris, a British entrepreneur based in Japan, is looking for a holiday home in Europe, either 
Tuscany or Puglia in Italy, or Bordeaux or Montpelier in France.
"Property prices in Tokyo and Shanghai are crazy and land comes at a premium. In order to own a nice place with a 
big veranda, I need to be very wealthy indeed," says Chris, who did not want to give his surname.
"I have been looking for a while, but then I thought the timing might be good from both an altruistic and self-centred 
perspective: it is a good time for money to be going back to the economy and hoping people will be motivated to 
sell," he says. From his research, he thinks that prices where he is looking are down about 10-15 per cent on where 
they were pre-Covid, and more sellers are willing to negotiate the price. "Spending money is good for everyone. I've 
set aside money for a couple of years to make a purchase and now feels like the right time to move. Whenever 
there is a crisis, there is a risk and the opportunity at the same time," he says.
Some agents believe that discounts could become common for mid-market homes - especially those in harder-to-
reach places such as the Maldives, the Seychelles and the Caribbean. Around the world, Green estimates that 
older, resale properties and those in non-prime locations or with restricted views could have their prices cut by up to 
30 per cent.
"Now is the good time to start negotiating, even before everything opens up, because you've got that uncertainty in 
the market," he says. "There are definitely deals to be had and sellers realise they need to be flexible, especially 
until markets fully reopen and buyers can travel freely again."
Agents say that homes at the top of the market are unlikely to be reduced by much. "The absolute best is so rarely 
available that we will find buyers," says Anthony Lassman, founder of Nota Bene, a luxury travel and real-estate 
business. He thinks luxury will also be the first market to bounce back once restrictions lift and quarantine is not 
required.
"With interest rates low, affordability to hold a property has never been stronger," says Hugo Thistlethwayte, head 
of global residential operations at Savills. He adds that demand has already picked up for "I want it now" sales, as 
people are emerging from lockdown and want to spend the summer in their newly purchased homes.
Thistlethwayte has noticed the reversal of a trend prevalent in recent years, where younger buyers have preferred 
smaller city apartments over larger, detached villas - a movement likely propelled by the ease of renting out homes 
on Airbnb. Now the demand is for farmhouses in Provence and Tuscan villas.
The future is local? As borders have closed, domestic buyers have replaced overseas buyers, says Thistlethwayte. 
Developers are also trying to adapt to the new situation by building residences for the post-pandemic world. One 
luxury developer in Cyprus - who did not want to be named - has overhauled its master plan for a five-star 
Your place in the sun International property With lockdown easing and discounts increasing - is now the time to 
buy a holiday home? By Aleksandra Wisniewska ; Y....
development from high-rise, high-density towers with an adjoining hotel to a villas-only project. It might even 
incorporate an organic farm, making it almost self-sufficient.
Green, who advises the developer, said that the shift to "Covid-compliant" is the new modus operandi in the 
business. Minimising crosssection pathways, installing air-circulation systems and using materials on which bacteria 
and viruses cannot survive for long are among the features that the industry is now focusing on.
"But hopefully this will pass and won't become something that we'll have to live with," he says.
Ultimately, the second-home market will depend on when and whether consumers feel confident about flying again, 
says Kate Everett-Allen of Knight Frank, on when people will feel comfortable to get on a plane again. She does not 
expect a repeat of the financial crisis of 2008, which saw widespread distressed selling in many parts of the world, 
but thinks buyers will sit on their hands for a while to see what happens.

M ike and Christine, a couple from the English Midlands, had agreed the sale and paid the deposit on a beautiful 
villa in Vence, between Nice and Cannes. They had even bought a car to drive in France.
The day after they signed the contract, however, all over-70s were told to self-isolate at home by the UK 
government to minimise their risk of catching Covid-19. The couple - who did not want to give their real names - got 
cold feet and pulled out of the deal.
Like those of many people, Mike and Christine's plans for buying a second home in warmer climes were thwarted 
by coronavirus, which has led to travel restrictions and lockdowns all over the world - and brought international 
property transactions to a halt. The couple say they are now taking time to reassess their options. It is not 
necessarily a bad thing that they pulled out of the deal: with the pound regaining some strength against the euro 
since the middle of March, by mid-April the property would have been £87,000 cheaper, thanks to the exchange 
rate.
"I am still confident we will get this one over the line, when the time's right," says their broker, Serge Cowen, 
founder of the Unique Living Network, which sells luxury property around the world.
Your place in the sun International property With lockdown easing and discounts increasing - is now the time to

Judging when might be the right time to invest in an overseas property is difficult. With airline fleets grounded 
globally and countries imposing - or considering imposing - extended quarantine periods for travellers, what will 
happen to the international holiday-home market this year? Will 2020 see deals dry up - or is now the time to buy a 
beautiful Tuscan villa at a bargain price? Grounded ambition Closed borders and travel bans have meant that the 
number of flights operating are well below usual volumes. As of the beginning of June, some European countries 
were recording a decline in traffic of more than 90 per cent, according to OAG, a consultancy tracking flights around 
the world.
This is beginning to change, however. Some budget airlines, such as Ryanair and Easyjet, are expected to resume 
flights this month or next - albeit at a significantly reduced capacity. British Airways is planning to restart a large 
number of flights in July. Air France is aiming for a gradual increase from this month.
With the possibility of special noquarantine agreements - so called "travel corridors" between the UK and certain 
Mediterranean resorts - this may be the saving grace for investors who, in the past few months, have seen property 
bookings "fall off the cliff", according to Robert Green, founder of Sphere Estates, which sells and rents luxury 
homes.
"The first half of this year is probably a write-off," he says. It will take months before normality returns, especially if 
UK holidaymakers will be put off by the prospect of spending two weeks in quarantine when they return - as current 
government policy dictates.
Short-term rental landlords will see reduced yields this year, as hosts struggle to fill their homes. "For two months 
we had zero reservations and zero revenue, and all our apartments stood empty," says Adriano Frigoli, founder of 
Nativo, a company that manages high-end Airbnb properties mostly in Milan and Madrid.
Since mid-May bookings have started again and in Milan, where the outbreak hit earlier than in Madrid, they are at 
80 per cent occupancy. "But the revenue is totally different, at 50-60 per cent of what it used to be," he says.
Airbnb has announced it will be scaling back its high-end short-break service, Airbnb Luxe, as the company - which 
is to make a quarter of its workforce redundant - adjusts to economic slowdown in response to the outbreakrelated 
slowdown.
"We probably won't know the full picture [for occupancy rates] until the end of August," says Green. "But some hotel 
industry experts do not expect a full recovery until at least 2023."
For buyers, viewing potential holiday homes has become almost impossible, as even private-jet travel depends on 
reopening borders. Despite some initial excitement from estate agents, only a few wealthy people have been willing 
to buy based on virtual viewings or live walk-throughs.
"We have managed to agree a small number of sales in this period, predominantly with clients who viewed before 
the lockdown," says Tim Swannie, director of buying agent Home Hunts.
Pent-up demand Despite the difficulty in visiting and buying during lockdown, potential buyers have still been 
searching for holiday homes. While a lot of this might be put down to idle scrolling, some agents believe it is a sign 
of pent-up demand.
Swannie says that compared with the same period last year, inquiries at Home Hunts were down only about 12-15 
per cent during lockdown, "which we have found quite encouraging. Over the past 10 days, inquiries Continued on 
page 2 Continued from page 1 [in France] have increased quite dramatically, particularly from UK and European 
buyers," he adds. "It feels like it is going to be a busy summer."
Miles, who did not want to give his real name, is among those expected to seal the deal in the next couple of 
months. He intends to purchase a three-bedroom villa at the Soneva Jani resort in the Maldives. The villa sits

directly on the water on stilts and decking. Miles had been searching for the right property in the Maldives ever 
since he and his partner took a trip there several years ago.
"It ticks all our boxes," he says, adding that he is hoping to earn money by renting it out as a short-term let when not 
using it. He is now consulting tax advisers and hoping to finalise the purchase in July. He believes he can buy the 
villa for $6m, reduced from a guide price of $6.5m.
Green expects that transactions will surge once the restrictions are lifted and people are free to move around again, 
and then stabilise. He says many potential buyers now inquire about fast internet connection, private outdoor space 
and extra room for incorporating a home office. Portugal's Algarve, the south of France and the Alps have been the 
destinations with the most interest, as they are easily accessible by car from the UK or elsewhere in Europe.
"People want to be able to run business from there," he says, adding that second-home buyers are starting to think 
about using the properties for longer periods. "I do see people working from different parts of Europe especially.
They own five or six homes and work from wherever," he adds.
Risk or opportunity? Chris, a British entrepreneur based in Japan, is looking for a holiday home in Europe, either 
Tuscany or Puglia in Italy, or Bordeaux or Montpelier in France.
"Property prices in Tokyo and Shanghai are crazy and land comes at a premium. In order to own a nice place with a 
big veranda, I need to be very wealthy indeed," says Chris, who did not want to give his surname.
"I have been looking for a while, but then I thought the timing might be good from both an altruistic and self-centred 
perspective: it is a good time for money to be going back to the economy and hoping people will be motivated to 
sell," he says. From his research, he thinks that prices where he is looking are down about 10-15 per cent on where 
they were pre-Covid, and more sellers are willing to negotiate the price. "Spending money is good for everyone. I've 
set aside money for a couple of years to make a purchase and now feels like the right time to move. Whenever 
there is a crisis, there is a risk and the opportunity at the same time," he says.
Some agents believe that discounts could become common for mid-market homes - especially those in harder-to-
reach places such as the Maldives, the Seychelles and the Caribbean. Around the world, Green estimates that 
older, resale properties and those in non-prime locations or with restricted views could have their prices cut by up to 
30 per cent.
"Now is the good time to start negotiating, even before everything opens up, because you've got that uncertainty in 
the market," he says. "There are definitely deals to be had and sellers realise they need to be flexible, especially 
until markets fully reopen and buyers can travel freely again."
Agents say that homes at the top of the market are unlikely to be reduced by much. "The absolute best is so rarely 
available that we will find buyers," says Anthony Lassman, founder of Nota Bene, a luxury travel and real-estate 
business. He thinks luxury will also be the first market to bounce back once restrictions lift and quarantine is not 
required.
"With interest rates low, affordability to hold a property has never been stronger," says Hugo Thistlethwayte, head 
of global residential operations at Savills. He adds that demand has already picked up for "I want it now" sales, as 
people are emerging from lockdown and want to spend the summer in their newly purchased homes.
Thistlethwayte has noticed the reversal of a trend prevalent in recent years, where younger buyers have preferred 
smaller city apartments over larger, detached villas - a movement likely propelled by the ease of renting out homes 
on Airbnb. Now the demand is for farmhouses in Provence and Tuscan villas.
The future is local? As borders have closed, domestic buyers have replaced overseas buyers, says Thistlethwayte. 
Developers are also trying to adapt to the new situation by building residences for the post-pandemic world. One 
luxury developer in Cyprus - who did not want to be named - has overhauled its master plan for a five-star 
Your place in the sun International property With lockdown easing and discounts increasing - is now the time to 
buy a holiday home? By Aleksandra Wisniewska ; Y....
development from high-rise, high-density towers with an adjoining hotel to a villas-only project. It might even 
incorporate an organic farm, making it almost self-sufficient.
Green, who advises the developer, said that the shift to "Covid-compliant" is the new modus operandi in the 
business. Minimising crosssection pathways, installing air-circulation systems and using materials on which bacteria 
and viruses cannot survive for long are among the features that the industry is now focusing on.
"But hopefully this will pass and won't become something that we'll have to live with," he says.
Ultimately, the second-home market will depend on when and whether consumers feel confident about flying again, 
says Kate Everett-Allen of Knight Frank, on when people will feel comfortable to get on a plane again. She does not 
expect a repeat of the financial crisis of 2008, which saw widespread distressed selling in many parts of the world, 
but thinks buyers will sit on their hands for a while to see what happens.

reach places such as the Maldives, the Seychelles and the Caribbean. Around the world, Green estimates that 
older, resale properties and those in non-prime locations or with restricted views could have their prices cut by up to 
30 per cent.
"Now is the good time to start negotiating, even before everything opens up, because you've got that uncertainty in 
the market," he says. "There are definitely deals to be had and sellers realise they need to be flexible, especially 
until markets fully reopen and buyers can travel freely again."
Agents say that homes at the top of the market are unlikely to be reduced by much. "The absolute best is so rarely 
available that we will find buyers," says Anthony Lassman, founder of Nota Bene, a luxury travel and real-estate 
business. He thinks luxury will also be the first market to bounce back once restrictions lift and quarantine is not 
required.
"With interest rates low, affordability to hold a property has never been stronger," says Hugo Thistlethwayte, head 
of global residential operations at Savills. He adds that demand has already picked up for "I want it now" sales, as 
people are emerging from lockdown and want to spend the summer in their newly purchased homes.
Thistlethwayte has noticed the reversal of a trend prevalent in recent years, where younger buyers have preferred 
smaller city apartments over larger, detached villas - a movement likely propelled by the ease of renting out homes 
on Airbnb. Now the demand is for farmhouses in Provence and Tuscan villas.
The future is local? As borders have closed, domestic buyers have replaced overseas buyers, says Thistlethwayte. 
Developers are also trying to adapt to the new situation by building residences for the post-pandemic world. One 
luxury developer in Cyprus - who did not want to be named - has overhauled its master plan for a five-star

development from high-rise, high-density towers with an adjoining hotel to a villas-only project. It might even 
incorporate an organic farm, making it almost self-sufficient.
Green, who advises the developer, said that the shift to "Covid-compliant" is the new modus operandi in the 
business. Minimising crosssection pathways, installing air-circulation systems and using materials on which bacteria 
and viruses cannot survive for long are among the features that the industry is now focusing on.
"But hopefully this will pass and won't become something that we'll have to live with," he says.
Ultimately, the second-home market will depend on when and whether consumers feel confident about flying again, 
says Kate Everett-Allen of Knight Frank, on when people will feel comfortable to get on a plane again. She does not 
expect a repeat of the financial crisis of 2008, which saw widespread distressed selling in many parts of the world, 
but thinks buyers will sit on their hands for a while to see what happens.

Airlines launch legal action against UK quarantine policy
Airlines launch legal action against UK quarantine policy

LONDON (AP) —
Three major airlines have launched legal action against the British government, describing the country’s plan to 
quarantine most incoming travelers as “flawed.’’
British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair said in a statement Friday that the quarantine will have a “devastating effect,’’ 
on tourism and the wider economy. The airlines want the government to re-adopt its previous policy, where 
quarantine is limited to passengers from “high risk” countries.
Quarantine measures imposed this week stipulate that all passengers — bar a handful of exceptions like truckers or 
medical workers — must fill in a form detailing where they will self-isolate for two weeks. The requirement applies 
regardless of whether they are U.K. citizens or not, and those who fail to comply could be fined.
The quarantine was imposed after a heated debate on whether it would help British efforts to tamp down the U.K. 
outbreak or simply stamp out any hopes that the British tourism industry will recover following months of lockdown.
Though industry advocates have suggested that Britain should create “air bridges’’ with countries that have low 
transmission rates, the government has hesitated. The airlines argue there has been no detail on how such 
proposals would be implemented.
“(The airlines) want the government to re-adopt its previous quarantine policy introduced on March 10, where 
quarantine is limited to passengers from 'high risk' countries,’’ they said in a statement. “This would be the most 
practical and effective solution and enables civil servants to focus on other, more significant, issues arising from the 
pandemic while bringing the U.K. in line with much of Europe which is opening its borders mid-June.’’
Airlines around the world are being slammed by the near total freeze in travel as countries seek to contain the 
outbreak. Carriers are forecast to lose $84 billion globally this year, which would be the industry's worst ever by far. 
Some have filed for bankruptcy or sought bailouts to survive the near-shutdown in their activity, and many are 
cutting thousands of jobs. The sector will likely take years to recover.
Airlines launch legal action against UK quarantine policy
British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair argue that the U.K. quarantine rules are more stringent than guidelines 
applied to people who actually have COVID-19, who do not have to report to authorities on their location.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative government has been widely criticized for its slow response to fighting 
the outbreak. Many in his government, including Johnson himself, came down with coronavirus.
Britain did not close its borders or impose testing and tracing measures for most travelers during the worst of the 
coronavirus outbreak. The government had insisted until May that putting restrictions at the border wouldn’t have a 
significant impact on the spread of the virus in the U.K.
Aviation has suffered huge losses following the near-halt in air travel as a result of pandemic restrictions. Hopes to 
rescue some part of the summer season depend on the relaxation of some rules.

— Downplaying virus risk, Trump gets back to business as usual
— The European Union urged all its member countries to start lifting travel restrictions on their common borders 
from next week, saying that the closures they introduced to tackle the coronavirus do little to limit its spread.
— Among the numerous rural areas across the U.S. that have recently experienced coronavirus outbreaks are 
migrant farmworker communities in Florida. Immokalee is one of them. The poor town of 25,000 north of the 
Everglades has become a hot spot, with cases more than doubling in the past two weeks.

MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte has been promised by his Chinese counterpart that the 
Philippines “as a friendly neighbor” will be prioritized when China is able to develop a vaccine against COVID-19.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Friday that Duterte got the assurance from Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 
a late Thursday telephone call that lasted 38 minutes.
Roque said Xi assured Duterte of “his country’s commitment to make the vaccine available for all, adding that the 
Philippines, as a friendly neighbor, would certainly be a priority.”

ISLAMABAD — Pakistan has reported 107 more COVID-19 deaths and 6,397 new cases, the highest single-day 
increase.
It brought Pakistan’s tally to 2,463 deaths among 125,933 confirmed cases.
The government said Friday that 40,247 patients have recovered.
Experts say Pakistan may witness a further rise in COVID-19 cases. They say the disease has spread across the 
country since last month when Prime Minister Imran Khan eased lockdown, saying he was doing it to save the ailing 
economy and people from hunger and poverty.
Pakistan’s economy will contract in the fiscal year ending June 30, for the first time in 68 years as a result of the 
global pandemic.

LONDON -- Official figures show that the British economy shrank by a colossal 20.4% in April, the first full month 
that the country was in its coronavirus lockdown.
The Office for National Statistics said Friday that all areas of the economy were hit, in particular pubs, education, 
health and car sales.
Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said April’s fall is “the biggest the U.K. has ever 
seen,” and “almost 10 times larger than the steepest pre-COVID-19 fall.”
April’s decline follows a 5.8% contraction in March. In April, the economy was about a quarter smaller than it was in 
February.
The U.K. was put into lockdown on March 23 and restrictions are slowly being eased. On Monday, nonessential 
shops, such as department stores and electronic retailers, are due to reopen.

CANBERRA, Australia — Australia’s prime minister expects international students will begin returning in July 
despite warnings of racism from China.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said after meeting federal state leaders on Friday that international students would be 
allowed to come to Australia under approved plans to study at nominated institutions.
Morrison said he expected all state borders to reopen in July, with the possible exception of Western Australia.
International students have been Australia’s most lucrative industry after mining, with China the largest source of 
foreign students.
China this week warned its citizens of the risk of pandemic-related racism if they traveled to Australia. Last month, 
China banned beef imports from Australia and ended trade in Australian barley through massive tariffs in what is 
widely regarded as retaliation for Australia calling for an investigation into the pandemic.
Foreign Minister Marise Payne on Friday accused China of “disinformation” through its racism warning. Morrison 
said he was not concerned that Chinese government warnings could deter Chinese students.

NEW DELHI— India’s coronavirus caseload has become the fourth-highest in the world, overtaking Britain, by 
adding 10,956 new cases in yet another biggest single-day spike.
India’s two-month lockdown kept transmission low but in a large population of 1.3 billion, people remain susceptible 
and the campaign against the virus is likely to go on for months, Balram Bhargava, director-general of the Indian 
Council of Medical Research, said.
India’s lockdown was imposed nationwide in late March but has eased since, and it is now largely being enforced in 
high-risk areas. The new cases rose after India reopened shops, shopping malls, manufacturing and religious 
places.
Subways, schools and movie theaters remain closed.
The increase reported Friday raised India’s confirmed cases to 297,535 with 8,498 deaths.

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea is reporting 56 new cases of COVID-19 as the country continues to see a 
resurgence of the virus concentrated in the capital area.
Figures released by South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday brought national totals to 
12,003 cases and 277 deaths. It says 10,699 people have so far been released from hospitals after recovery, but 
1,057 others remain in treatment.
At least 45 of the new cases were reported from the Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea’s 51 
million people live. Health officials have struggled to track transmissions linked to entertainment and leisure 
activities, church gatherings and low-income workers who couldn’t afford to stay home.

RENO, Nevada — Nevada health officials are closely monitoring a recent uptick in confirmed COVID-19 cases 
statewide, including the biggest one-day increase to date in the Reno area reported Thursday.
But the state’s response director isn’t convinced a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak has arrived.
Nevada COVID-19 Response Director Caleb Cage says the state has seen an above-average rise in daily positive 
cases this week and experienced six consecutive days of an increase in the number of cases requiring

hospitalization. He says the most recent spike is the fourth highest since the pandemic was declared in mid-March 
in Nevada, which now has nearly 10,400 cases and 458 deaths.
But Cage adds that “our assessment based on this data is that we are not seeing evidence of a second wave of 
COVID-19 in the state of Nevada yet.”

BEIJING — China has reported seven new coronavirus cases, including the first instance of local transmission in 
Beijing in weeks.
Authorities said Friday that the other six cases were all brought into the country by Chinese citizens arriving from 
abroad. No new deaths were reported.
Officials in Beijing say the locally transmitted case involves a 52-year-old man who arrived alone at a clinic 
displaying an intermittent fever but no other symptoms. He was swiftly diagnosed as having COVID-19, prompting 
authorities to isolate family members and reinstate anti-virus measures in his neighborhood.
The man said he had not left Beijing Beijing for more than two weeks and had not been in contact with anyone from 
outside the city.

GRAHAM, N.C. — A North Carolina judge has ordered a small stock car track to halt racing after state health 
officials declared that large weekend crowds at recent races violated an executive order by Gov. Roy Cooper aimed 
at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.
The judge agreed Thursday to issue a temporary restraining order preventing Ace Speedway in Alamance County 
from holding further events for now.
Earlier this week, the state health secretary called the track an “imminent hazard,” ordered it closed and told the 
operators to announce the closure publicly. There was no evidence the owners did that, so officals asked the court 
to intervene.
The governor’s restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus limit outdoor gatherings to 25 people.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Puerto Rico’s governor says she will lift nearly all restrictions aimed at curbing 
coronavirus cases, which means beaches, churches and businesses across the U.S. territory will reopen after a 
three-month shutdown.
Gov. Wanda Vázquez said Thursday the changes will occur starting next week. She says businesses including 
gyms and movie theaters will be allowed to operate seven days a week.
However, she says an overnight curfew will remain in place for two weeks, with people required to be inside from 10 
p.m. to 5 a.m.
The governor also says that Puerto Rico will begin welcoming tourists again starting July 15 and that airport 
screenings will continue.

GENEVA — Geneva’s most famous landmark, the towering fountain known as the Jet d’Eau, has fired back up 
after an 83-day stoppage amid broad lockdown measures for the coronavirus outbreak.
The Latest: 3 airlines challenge UK quarantine in court
It was the longest such pause since the spray began operations in 1951. The head of the Geneva-based World 
Health Organization took part in a reopening ceremony Thursday that epitomized the recent easing of restrictive 
measures as case counts of COVID-19 have fallen dramatically in Switzerland.
The Geneva utility that operates the Jet d’Eau said it was switched off March 20 “to embody the lockdown and the 
associated sanitary measures as well as to protect staff involved in its proper functioning.”
The fountain shoots up a 140-meter (460-foot) plume of water onto Lake Geneva.

SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea’s top infectious disease expert has raised alarm over the speed of coronavirus 
transmissions in the densely populated capital area, where around 30 to 50 new infections have been reported 
each day since late May.
Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says the average 
infectiousness of virus carriers in the Seoul metropolitan area was about three times higher than in the rest of the 
country.
She said the basic reproduction number of virus carriers — which measures the number of infections caused by an 
individual — in the capital area reached as high as 1.7 or 1.8 in recent weeks. Any number above 1 indicates a 
growing epidemic.
She pleaded with Seoul residents to stay home over the weekend, saying there was “high concern” that increased 
public activity would lead to a massive circulation of the virus.
Health workers have struggled to trace hundreds of infections linked to e-commerce workers, church gatherings, 
elderly door-to-door sellers and clubgoers.

a late Thursday telephone call that lasted 38 minutes.
Roque said Xi assured Duterte of “his country’s commitment to make the vaccine available for all, adding that the 
Philippines, as a friendly neighbor, would certainly be a priority.”

ISLAMABAD — Pakistan has reported 107 more COVID-19 deaths and 6,397 new cases, the highest single-day 
increase.
It brought Pakistan’s tally to 2,463 deaths among 125,933 confirmed cases.
The government said Friday that 40,247 patients have recovered.
Experts say Pakistan may witness a further rise in COVID-19 cases. They say the disease has spread across the 
country since last month when Prime Minister Imran Khan eased lockdown, saying he was doing it to save the ailing 
economy and people from hunger and poverty.
Pakistan’s economy will contract in the fiscal year ending June 30, for the first time in 68 years as a result of the 
global pandemic.

LONDON -- Official figures show that the British economy shrank by a colossal 20.4% in April, the first full month 
that the country was in its coronavirus lockdown.
The Office for National Statistics said Friday that all areas of the economy were hit, in particular pubs, education, 
health and car sales.
Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said April’s fall is “the biggest the U.K. has ever 
seen,” and “almost 10 times larger than the steepest pre-COVID-19 fall.”
April’s decline follows a 5.8% contraction in March. In April, the economy was about a quarter smaller than it was in 
February.
The U.K. was put into lockdown on March 23 and restrictions are slowly being eased. On Monday, nonessential 
shops, such as department stores and electronic retailers, are due to reopen.

CANBERRA, Australia — Australia’s prime minister expects international students will begin returning in July 
despite warnings of racism from China.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said after meeting federal state leaders on Friday that international students would be 
allowed to come to Australia under approved plans to study at nominated institutions.
Morrison said he expected all state borders to reopen in July, with the possible exception of Western Australia.
International students have been Australia’s most lucrative industry after mining, with China the largest source of 
foreign students.
China this week warned its citizens of the risk of pandemic-related racism if they traveled to Australia. Last month, 
China banned beef imports from Australia and ended trade in Australian barley through massive tariffs in what is 
widely regarded as retaliation for Australia calling for an investigation into the pandemic.
Foreign Minister Marise Payne on Friday accused China of “disinformation” through its racism warning. Morrison 
said he was not concerned that Chinese government warnings could deter Chinese students.

NEW DELHI— India’s coronavirus caseload has become the fourth-highest in the world, overtaking Britain, by 
adding 10,956 new cases in yet another biggest single-day spike.
India’s two-month lockdown kept transmission low but in a large population of 1.3 billion, people remain susceptible 
and the campaign against the virus is likely to go on for months, Balram Bhargava, director-general of the Indian 
Council of Medical Research, said.
India’s lockdown was imposed nationwide in late March but has eased since, and it is now largely being enforced in 
high-risk areas. The new cases rose after India reopened shops, shopping malls, manufacturing and religious 
places.
Subways, schools and movie theaters remain closed.
The increase reported Friday raised India’s confirmed cases to 297,535 with 8,498 deaths.

The Latest: S. Korea expert alarmed over speed of infections
SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea is reporting 56 new cases of COVID-19 as the country continues to see a 
resurgence of the virus concentrated in the capital area.
Figures released by South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday brought national totals to 
12,003 cases and 277 deaths. It says 10,699 people have so far been released from hospitals after recovery, but 
1,057 others remain in treatment.
At least 45 of the new cases were reported from the Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea’s 51 
million people live. Health officials have struggled to track transmissions linked to entertainment and leisure 
activities, church gatherings and low-income workers who couldn’t afford to stay home.

RENO, Nevada — Nevada health officials are closely monitoring a recent uptick in confirmed COVID-19 cases 
statewide, including the biggest one-day increase to date in the Reno area reported Thursday.
But the state’s response director isn’t convinced a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak has arrived.
Nevada COVID-19 Response Director Caleb Cage says the state has seen an above-average rise in daily positive 
cases this week and experienced six consecutive days of an increase in the number of cases requiring 
hospitalization. He says the most recent spike is the fourth highest since the pandemic was declared in mid-March 
in Nevada, which now has nearly 10,400 cases and 458 deaths.
But Cage adds that “our assessment based on this data is that we are not seeing evidence of a second wave of 
COVID-19 in the state of Nevada yet.”

BEIJING — China has reported seven new coronavirus cases, including the first instance of local transmission in 
Beijing in weeks.
Authorities said Friday that the other six cases were all brought into the country by Chinese citizens arriving from 
abroad. No new deaths were reported.
Officials in Beijing say the locally transmitted case involves a 52-year-old man who arrived alone at a clinic 
displaying an intermittent fever but no other symptoms. He was swiftly diagnosed as having COVID-19, prompting 
authorities to isolate family members and reinstate anti-virus measures in his neighborhood.
The man said he had not left Beijing Beijing for more than two weeks and had not been in contact with anyone from 
outside the city.

GRAHAM, N.C. — A North Carolina judge has ordered a small stock car track to halt racing after state health 
officials declared that large weekend crowds at recent races violated an executive order by Gov. Roy Cooper aimed 
at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.
The judge agreed Thursday to issue a temporary restraining order preventing Ace Speedway in Alamance County 
from holding further events for now.
Earlier this week, the state health secretary called the track an “imminent hazard,” ordered it closed and told the 
operators to announce the closure publicly. There was no evidence the owners did that, so officals asked the court 
to intervene.
The governor’s restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus limit outdoor gatherings to 25 people.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Puerto Rico’s governor says she will lift nearly all restrictions aimed at curbing 
coronavirus cases, which means beaches, churches and businesses across the U.S. territory will reopen after a 
three-month shutdown.
Gov. Wanda Vázquez said Thursday the changes will occur starting next week. She says businesses including 
gyms and movie theaters will be allowed to operate seven days a week.
However, she says an overnight curfew will remain in place for two weeks, with people required to be inside from 10 
p.m. to 5 a.m.
The governor also says that Puerto Rico will begin welcoming tourists again starting July 15 and that airport 
screenings will continue.

GENEVA — Geneva’s most famous landmark, the towering fountain known as the Jet d’Eau, has fired back up 
after an 83-day stoppage amid broad lockdown measures for the coronavirus outbreak.
It was the longest such pause since the spray began operations in 1951. The head of the Geneva-based World 
Health Organization took part in a reopening ceremony Thursday that epitomized the recent easing of restrictive 
measures as case counts of COVID-19 have fallen dramatically in Switzerland.
The Geneva utility that operates the Jet d’Eau said it was switched off March 20 “to embody the lockdown and the 
associated sanitary measures as well as to protect staff involved in its proper functioning.”
The fountain shoots up a 140-meter (460-foot) plume of water onto Lake Geneva.

Ryanair is likely to book losses in the first and second quarters of its current financial year due to the travel 
restrictions imposed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the company confirmed on Friday.
"The group expects to record a loss of over 200 million euros ($226 million) in Q1, with a smaller loss expected in 
Q2," Ryanair said in an emailed statement.
Spain's Expansion newspaper had earlier reported that Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said that losses 
could run to as much as 300 million euros in the financial year to March 2021. Ryanair said that O'Leary had been 
misquoted in the article.
"Ryanair has not provided new guidance since May 18," the company said, adding that it could not provide 
forecasts for the financial year as a whole.
The airline had said in May that it expects to post a loss of a little more than 200 million euros in the three months to 
the end of June. Making a profit forecast for the year to March 2021 was impossible, O'Leary said at that time.
The July-September period, the second quarter for Ryanair, is its busiest period as it covers the peak summer 
holiday season.
Ryanair reported a profit after tax of 1 billion euros for the year to the end of March 2020.
Ryanair has joined forces with British Airways and easyJet to launch legal action against the British government's 
quarantine policy to try to overturn what they see as overly strict rules that will hamper their efforts to get 
passengers flying again. (Reuters)

UK air passengers urged not to take hand luggage on planes

British airline passengers should avoid bringing hand luggage on to a plane in order to reduce the risk of 
coronavirus transmission, according to new government advice.
However, the recommendation was criticised by Europe's biggest airline, Ryanair, which said it was safer for 
passengers to carry rather than check in bags. The Department for Transport guidance "strongly" encourages 
passengers to check in bags and minimise hand luggage because it will "speed up boarding and disembarking and 
minimise the risk of transmission".
The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the guidelines were "a positive next step" for the embattled aviation 
sector to start recovery, after most flights were grounded due to coronavirus and travel restrictions from late March.
Shapps added: "The government's advice currently remains to avoid all non-essential travel, but today we are 
taking the necessary steps to ensure a framework is in place for the aviation industry to bounce back when it is safe 
for restrictions on travel to be lifted."
The guidelines for air travel come as more flights are due to resume next week, when easyJet will restart domestic 
services from Gatwick.
The advice, which broadly follows the guidance from the UN aviation body the International Civil Aviation 
Organisation (ICAO) as well as input from the UK aviation industry, also recommends checking in online and 
remaining seated as much as possible during the flight.
General health advice will continue to apply, such as attempting to maintain social distancing where possible in the 
airport, and washing hands regularly after touching any surfaces, including check-in kiosks and trolleys.
Passengers are urged to bring their own face covering for use throughout their journey including at the airport, with 
spare coverings for longer journeys and plastic bags to store used masks.
Specific rules on temperature checks or self-certification, which some airlines and airports have asked for, have not 
been issued. But in line with general guidance passengers have been told not to travel if they have been in close 
contact with anyone with symptoms in the past 14 days.
UK air passengers urged not to take hand luggage on planes
Tim Hawkins, chief strategy officer at MAG, the owner of Stansted and Manchester airports, said they had 
collaborated with the government to draw up the guidelines, based on advice from independent medical and 
scientific experts who looked at necessary safety measures at each stage of travel.
But Ryanair said that it recommended hand luggage, which would only be touched by the passenger, rather than 
checked-in bags which would have contact with multiple baggage handlers and check-in staff.
Apart from Ryanair, most airlines and airports welcomed the guidelines, which they said would help pave the way 
for travel to resume - but also urged the government to remove the impediment of its controversial quarantine rules 
and introduce proposed "air bridges" to enable flights to selected international destinations as soon as possible.
Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said the guidelines were welcome: "They demonstrate how airlines 
can apply targeted and multi-layered measures to ensure air travel is safe for customers and crew."
The International Air Transport Association said the measures were sensible but "rendered useless if the 
government continues with the 14-day quarantine rule".
A Ryanair spokesperson said the government should "stop issuing rubbish advice to passengers about baggage 
and instead focus their efforts on scrapping the UK's useless visitor quarantine, which the UK Home Office now 
admit cannot be implemented, supervised or policed effectively".

British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair said on Friday they have begun legal action against the British government's 
quarantine policy in a bid to overturn what they see as overly strict rules.
All three airlines had hoped to resume regular flights after air travel came to a total standstill during the coronavirus 
pandemic, leading to almost 20,000 job losses between them.
But Britain's 14-day quarantine, introduced on June 8 for arrivals from abroad, is deterring bookings at a time when 
other European countries are beginning to open their borders.
The airlines said in a statement issued by BA's parent company IAG they had lodged their complaint with the High 
Court, asking for a judicial review as soon as possible.
If judges agree, lawyers have said the government would have to show the scientific evidence that underpinned the 
rule.
There was no immediate response from the British government, which has previously defended quarantine as 
necessary to prevent a second wave of the coronavirus.
Britain's chief scientist said earlier in June that politicians decided the policy, adding quarantines worked best for 
restricting travel from countries with high infection rates.
The airlines said there was no scientific evidence for the policy and there had been no consultation with the industry 
on the new rules.
BA , easyJet and Ryanair fight British quarantine with legal action
Their legal action escalates tensions with the British government, and the relationship is in contrast to France and 
Germany where governments have bailed out their carriers.
The airlines said they wanted the government to re-adopt its previous quarantine policy introduced on March 10 
which applied only to passengers arriving from countries deemed as high risk.
They also dismissed "air bridges," bilateral deals between countries with low infection rates, which the government 
has presented as a potential alternative to the quarantine, saying they had not yet seen any evidence of how these 
would work. (Reuters)

A weekly round-up of the latest news from the aviation industry as airlines and airports begin to recover from the 
COVID-19 crisis.
British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair have launched legal action against the UK government's 14-day quarantine 
measures.
A statement from BA's parent company, International Airlines Group, said the airlines would be asking for a judicial 
review to be heard as soon as possible.
The rules came into effect on Monday (June 8) and require passengers arriving from abroad to self-isolate at a 
single address for 14 days.
The three carriers have urged the government to instead revisit a policy briefly introduced in March that saw 
passengers from countries deemed at high risk of coronavirus infection being ordered to self-isolate
A joint statement said: "This would be the most practical and effective solution and enables civil servants to focus 
on other, more significant issues arising from the pandemic while bringing the UK in line with much of Europe which 
is opening its borders mid-June."
Italy's flag carrier Alitalia plans to increase number of flights and destinations served in July, operating 60% more 
flights compared to June and double the number of services compared to May.
The airline will fly 52 routes in July-22 more than in June-to 37 airports; this comprises 19 in Italy and 18 abroad. 
Destinations returning include Amsterdam (AMS), Boston (BOS) and Tel Aviv (TLV).
Seats offered in July will also grow by 60% compared to the previous month, the carrier said.
Cathay Pacific said it expects to operate approximately 3.5% capacity in June and 9.4% in July. However, it added 
the plans remain "contingent on the further relaxation of travel restrictions around the world."
The airline, which this week secured a government-led bailout package worth HK$39 billion ($5 billion), carried a 
total of 18,473 passengers last month-a decrease of 99.4% compared with May 2019. Capacity, measured in 
available seat kilometres (ASKs), decreased by 97.5%.

"Though there have been some small positive signs, such as the ban on transit traffic through Hong Kong 
International Airport beginning to ease, the future remains very uncertain," chief customer and commercial officer 
Ronald Lam said.
"Unlike many of our global airline peers, we have no domestic network and so are entirely dependent upon cross-
border travel."
Air Serbia is planning to increase the number of weekly flights from Belgrade (BEG) to Zurich (ZRH) Berlin (TXL) 
and Frankfurt (FRA) due to rising demand.
The Serbian flag carrier will operate up to two flights per day to ZRH in June, and up to 3X-daily from July. In 
August, the airline will begin flying to FRA 10X-weekly, up from the current 7X-weekly. TXL will also increase from 6 
to 10X-weekly.
"We continue to carefully monitor the situation and proactively adjust our traffic to demand," CEO Duncan Naysmith 
said.
"Destinations in Switzerland and Germany are extremely important for us, primarily because of the large number of 
Serbian citizens who live and work in those countries, but also for business people and tourists."
Solomon Airlines has suspended regular scheduled international passenger flights until Aug. 31.
CEO Brett Gebers said the airline would continue to take advice from the Solomon Islands government regarding 
necessary precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and in conjunction with continuing border restrictions in 
international markets.
In the meantime, the carrier will continue to operate repatriation passenger and cargo flights on behalf.
The European Commission (EC) has approved plans by the Portuguese and Finnish governments to provide 
financial support to their respective national carriers after ruling the funding does not breach European Union (EU) 
state aid rules. TAP Air Portugal will receive a (EURO)1.2 billion ($1.36 billion) rescue loan, while Finnair will 
undergo a (EURO)286 million ($323 million) recapitalisation.
Air France has said that by the end of June its French regional flight schedule will represent 20% of the capacity 
usually deployed over this period.
In July and August, the gradual increase in the number of frequencies and destinations will continue, with the 
resumption of several services between Paris and the French regions, inter-regional routes, and the launch of 
seasonal routes, particularly to and from Corsica.
In total, Air France will operate inter-regional routes to and from 27 metropolitan destinations, connecting them to 
close to 150 destinations worldwide via the Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) hub.
HK Express has extended its temporary flight operations suspension to July 11. The Hong Kong LCC airline plans 
to gradually resume flight operations from July 12, subject to market developments.

A weekly round-up of the latest news from the aviation industry as airlines and airports begin to recover from the 
COVID-19 crisis.
British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair have launched legal action against the UK government's 14-day quarantine 
measures.
A statement from BA's parent company, International Airlines Group, said the airlines would be asking for a judicial 
review to be heard as soon as possible.
The rules came into effect on Monday (June 8) and require passengers arriving from abroad to self-isolate at a 
single address for 14 days.
The three carriers have urged the government to instead revisit a policy briefly introduced in March that saw 
passengers from countries deemed at high risk of coronavirus infection being ordered to self-isolate
A joint statement said: "This would be the most practical and effective solution and enables civil servants to focus 
on other, more significant issues arising from the pandemic while bringing the UK in line with much of Europe which 
is opening its borders mid-June."

Airlines launch legal action on Britain 's Covid quarantine rule
Airlines launch legal action on Britain's Covid quarantine rule

Three major airlines launched legal action on Friday against the British government's requirement for all 
international arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days to curb the spread of coronavirus.
British Airways, Ryanair and easyJet demanded an urgent judicial review of the quarantine rule, which will have "a 
devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy and destroy thousands of jobs."
"The airlines have not yet seen any evidence on how and when proposed 'air bridges' between the UK and other 
countries will be implemented," they wrote in a joint statement.
The "air bridges" would create exemptions allowing tourists to return from countries such as Spain, Portugal and 
Greece without needing to self-isolate.
Ireland is currently the only nation exempt from the quarantine rule, which the government imposed on Monday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the measure, initially only in place until June 28, was necessary so that "those 
arriving from abroad ... don't unknowingly spread the virus."
The airlines urged the government to switch back to a previous rule requiring quarantine for arrivals from "high risk" 
countries, "bringing the UK in line with much of Europe, which is opening its borders mid-June."
They said there was "no consultation and no scientific evidence provided for such a severe policy," adding that the 
government was effectively banning people from travelling to countries with lower coronavirus infection rates than 
Britain.
Britain has reported Europe's highest total of deaths of people infected with coronavirus, at about 41,000. Its 
estimated infection rate remains higher than in most European nations.

 ADRs of Ryanair (RYAAY) were higher Friday after the low-cost airline filed a lawsuit together with easyJet and 
British Airways against the UK government's COVID-19 quarantine policy, claiming that the policy will hamper 
bookings and harm their businesses, according to media reports. 
The airlines argued that there is no scientific evidence for the mandatory 14-day quarantine period for travelers 
coming into the UK and urged for a judicial review by the High Court. If agreed by the judges, the government will 
need to present scientific evidence supporting the rule, reports said.
The companies also criticized the government's idea of air bridges - an arrangement in which tourists from a 
country with a low COVID-19 transmission rate may be allowed to travel to another country without self-isolation - 
due to a lack of evidence over how these would work.

Jun 12, 2020( Financial Buzz: http://www.financialbuzz.com Delivered by Newstex)  British Airways (BA) is 
organizing an auction to sell art valued at Millions in the hopes that it can rally up cash as the COVID-19 pandemic 
surges. International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE: IAG.L), BA's parent company, cautioned in April that the 
airline would have to lay off at least 12,000 employees as they strive to recover from the economic blow. 
Nevertheless, BA explained it has not made any concrete future decisions and strives to protect both its finances 
and workers. According to The Evening Standard, a U.K newspaper, the auction will deliver pieces from Damien 
Hirst, Peter Doig and Bridget Riley. One of the pieces is set to be sold for over USD1.26 Million. The works of art up 
for sale were previously exhibited inside British Airways airport lounges. Once perceived as the best in its class, the 
airline is now struggling financially as well as with its government and employee relationships. BA's management of 
the overall crisis has been toxic, as described by workers, additionally it has provoked political kickback. The art 
work will be inspected and valued by Sotheby's auction house according to The Standard. Neither BA nor Sotheby's 
opted to comment when asked about the matter.  IAG reported a loss of EUR535 MIllion during its first quarter, a 
vast plunge compared to its EUR135 Million profit in the prior year. Following the release of the U.K government's 
quarantine rules, one of which enforced that travelers self-isolate 14 days before flying, BA along with Ryanair and 
easyjet initiated a legal challenge against it. According to the airlines, the tactic would cause 'devastating' 
repercussions for the British Tourism industry. Amid the pandemic, profit for the airline industry is anticipated to 
decrease by 50% to USD419 Billion during 2020, as stated by the International Air Transport Association.

arcade near Sensoji Temple in Tokyo Friday, June 12, 2020. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)The outbreak of the 
coronavirus has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed. Following are developments 
Friday related to the national and global response, the work place and the spread of the virus. 
________________________ EARNINGS RESULTS: — Party City's first-quarter sales fell 19% as it dealt with 
temporary store closures. 
Its North American online sales dropped 15.4%. However, when adjusted for curbside pickup and delivery and buy 
online/pick up in store, the figure declined 6.9%.  CEO Brad Weston said Friday that the company has an 
agreement with some bondholders to support a set of transactions that would lower its debt by more than 25% and 
raise approximately $100 million in new capital, if consummated. Party City currently has more than 85% of its 
stores reopened. — Hooker Furniture's fiscal first-quarter sales dropped 22.8%, according to preliminary estimates. 
The company said the declined was driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, economic shutdown and stay-at-home 
orders throughout the U.S. Chairman and CEO Paul B. Toms said orders fell more than 70% in March and about 
65% in April. However, those numbers have started to improve as stores and the economy reopens. In May, order 
declined approximately 7%.  'We believe there are several positive factors in play such as pent-up demand, more 
focus on home environments and less competition for discretionary consumer spending from travel, eating out and 
other activities,' Toms said. TRAVEL: — Three airlines have launched legal action against the British government, 
describing the country's plan to quarantine most incoming travelers as 'flawed.'' British Airways, easyJet and 
Ryanair said in a statement Friday that the quarantine will have a 'devastating effect,'' on tourism and the wider 
economy. The airlines want the government to re-adopt its previous quarantine policy, where quarantine was limited 
to passengers from 'high risk' countries. (Ad) Former Chicago Board Options Exchange trader is revealing his tricks 
and tips in a one-of-a-kind manual: "5 Secret Trading Strategies to Win Every Day in the Market." For a limited 
time... he's making this valuable guide 100% free.Quarantine measures imposed this week stipulate that all 
passengers — bar a handful of exceptions like truckers or medical workers — must fill in a form detailing where 
they will self-isolate for two weeks. The requirement applies regardless whether they are U.K. citizens or not, and 
those who fail to comply could be fined. CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS &#38; BANKS: — Japan's parliament 
approved a 32 trillion yen ($300 billion) second supplementary budget Friday to help fund 117 trillion yen ($1.1 
trillion) in measures to soften the blow to the economy from the virus outbreak. The extra funding includes support 
for small businesses, including programs to finance their rents and to adjust employment. It will also pay for 
measures to help prepare for possible future waves of infections, including development of vaccines and treatments 
Retail sales look to recover; nations eye economic concerns
for COVID-19. — Official figures show that the British economy shrank by a colossal 20.4% in April, the first full 
month that the country was in its lockdown. The Office for National Statistics said Friday that all areas of the 
economy were hit, in particular pubs, education, health and car sales. April's decline follows a 5.8% contraction in 
March. In April, the economy was about a quarter smaller than it was in February. MARKETS: Stock markets picked 
up on Friday after a day of losses in Asia and following Wall Street's heavy sell-off the day before on worries over a 
possible second wave of coronavirus cases.10 Stocks to Sell in 2020[1]For some investors, selling stocks can be 
hard. It can seem like a personal failure. But it's really just a mindset. You have to understand that waiting out a 
stock may be the right thing to do when time is on your side. But if you are investing for specific and/or time-
sensitive goals, holding onto an underperforming stock can have a big impact. Ideally, an investor could look at their 
portfolio at the end of the year and like trimming a rose bush, cut off the dead parts and move on. But with a new 
year upon us, it could be tempting to wait things out. We've provided you this presentation to give you a look at ten 
stocks that you should consider selling. Some of these stocks are being affected by short-term setbacks. Others 
may be a buying opportunity at a lower price. That's for you to decide. View the "10 Stocks to Sell in 2020"[2]. [ 1]:

easyJet, and Ryanair have joined forces to take legal action against the UK government over its compulsory 
quarantine for new arrivals.The rule came into force on Monday and requires anyone arriving in the UK by plane to 
spend 14 days in quarantine.The trio told Business Insider they are seeking a judicial review to overturn the 
measure.The "flawed" plan will have "a devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy and destroy 
thousands of jobs," the airlines said.The airlines say they will accept the old rule back, where quarantine was limited 
to passengers arriving from "high risk" countries.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. British 
Airways, easyJet and Ryanair — three of the largest airlines in Europe — are together taking legal action against 
the UK government over its compulsory 14-day quarantine required for all new arrivals.The airlines are grouping 
together to seek a judicial review which would overturn the rule, the trio told Business Insider in a joint statement 
Friday.The airlines said the "government's flawed quarantine" will have "a devastating effect on British tourism and 
the wider economy and destroy thousands of jobs."The legal basis for the complaint is based on the premise that 
the 14-day quarantine is "more stringent than the guidelines applied to people who actually have COVID-19," the 
airlines said."There was no consultation and no scientific evidence provided for such a severe policy," they 
said.They added that they want the government to revert to the policy introduced on March 10, where "quarantine is 
limited to passengers from 'high risk' countries."Last month, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary called[2] the 14-day 
quarantine "idiotic" and said it is "both unimplementable and unmanageable," suggesting masks and temperature 
checks would do.(Temperature checks are ineffective in catching coronavirus cases[3] where patients don't get a 
fever. 
About a quarter of coronavirus patients don't develop fevers.)The UK is one of the worst-hit countries in Europe, 
and some countries have taken steps of their own to minimize the risk of a second wave of infections from 
Britain.On Wednesday, Slovakia excluded Britain from its EU travel corridor[4] over concerns people from the UK 
were most likely to bring the virus.The UK government has scrambled to find ways to keep the travel industry alive, 
including floating the idea of "air bridges" between the UK and select other countries.But easyJet, British Airways, 
and Ryanair said Friday they have "not yet seen any evidence on how and when proposed 'air bridges' between the 
UK and other countries will be implemented."Portugal[5] has expressed willingness to welcome UK tourists this

Jun 12, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We recently issued an 
updated report on Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. EXPD[1].Like many other transportation companies, 
Expeditors is hit by uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic.Expeditors' first-quarter 2020 top line was hurt 
due to supply-chain disruptions stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. The extended closure of factories in 
China due to the virus outbreak dented freight volumes in the March quarter. Notably, volumes pertaining to 
airfreight tonnage and ocean container contracted 7% and 10%, respectively, year over year. Apart from factory 
shutdowns, commercial flight cancellations and reduced ocean sailings led to double-digit fall in operating 
income.With the current economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Expeditors' operations are under 
pressure. For instance, North Asia, South Asia and North America registered tonnage declines of 9%, 11% and 4%, 
respectively, in first-quarter 2020. With the health peril showing no signs of subsiding, volumes is likely to be weak 
in the second quarter as well, thereby hurting overall results.Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. Price

Washington, Inc. 
price[2] | Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. Quote[3]Meanwhile, Expeditors currently has a sound 
balance sheet. We are also encouraged by Expeditors' sound balance sheet. As of Mar 31, 2020, the company had 
no long-term debt (other than lease liabilities), mainly due to its asset-light business model. Moreover, its current 
ratio stood at 2.26 and 2.37 at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 
respectively, comparing favorably with the respective figures for the industry of 1.72 and 1.83. A higher current ratio

Jun 12, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per a Reuters report[1], 
European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] is likely to incur a net loss in the band of €200-€300 million 
($226-$339 million) in fiscal year 2021 (ending Mar 31, 2021). According to the report, Ryanair's CEO Michael 
O'Leary provided this bleak forecast in an interview to Spanish newspaper, Expansion.The drab projection is 
primarily prompted by the coronavirus-induced lackluster air-travel demand scenario. In fact, due to the ongoing 
global health peril, majority of Ryanair's fleet remains grounded. Notably, in May, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Irish 
carrier operated only 701 scheduled flights including those for rescue operations, relief and medicine supply on 
behalf of various EU governments. 
Also, with the coronavirus pandemic disrupting air-travel demand, Ryanair reported a 99.5% year-over-year plunge 
in May traffic to merely 0.07 million guests. Due to travel bans and curbs, Ryanair expects its traffic numbers for 
June to be persistently minimal.In a bid to adjust to this extremely low-demand scenario, Ryanair is cutting costs to 
drive its bottom line. The company reduced its average weekly cash burn rate to around €60 million in May from 
approximately €200 million in March.Coming back to O'Leary's comments, he stated on a more positive note that 
the carrier is expected to make profits again starting fiscal 2022. However, throwing in a word of caution he said 
that 'Everything will depend on how people will fly between September and March and that there is no second-wave 
outbreak'.Other Key Picks Investors interested in the broader Zacks Transportation sector may also consider some 
other top-ranked stocks like Air Lease Corporation AL[3],Teekay Tankers Ltd. TNK[4] and GasLog LP GLOG[5], all

Jun 12, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  A man sits wearing a face shield in 
the arrivals area on the first day of new rules that people arriving in Britain from overseas will have to quarantine 
themselves for 14 days to help stop the spread of coronavirus, at Heathrow Airpot in London, Monday, June 8, 
2020. The British government has said that anyone caught not complying with the quarantine will face a fine. (AP 
Photo/Matt Dunham)LONDON (AP) —  Three major airlines have launched legal action against the British 
government, describing the country's plan to quarantine most incoming travelers as 'flawed.'' British Airways, 
easyJet and Ryanair said in a statement Friday that the quarantine will have a 'devastating effect,'' on tourism and 
the wider economy. The airlines want the government to re-adopt its previous policy, where quarantine is limited to 
passengers from 'high risk' countries. 
Quarantine measures imposed this week stipulate that all passengers — bar a handful of exceptions like truckers or 
medical workers — must fill in a form detailing where they will self-isolate for two weeks. The requirement applies 
regardless of whether they are U.K. citizens or not, and those who fail to comply could be fined. The quarantine was 
imposed after a heated debate on whether it would help British efforts to tamp down the U.K. outbreak or simply 
stamp out any hopes that the British tourism industry will recover following months of lockdown. Though industry 
advocates have suggested that Britain should create 'air bridges'' with countries that have low transmission rates, 
the government has hesitated. The airlines argue there has been no detail on how such proposals would be 
implemented. '(The airlines) want the government to re-adopt its previous quarantine policy introduced on March 
10, where quarantine is limited to passengers from 'high risk' countries,'' they said in a statement. 'This would be 
the most practical and effective solution and enables civil servants to focus on other, more significant, issues arising 
from the pandemic while bringing the U.K. in line with much of Europe which is opening its borders mid-June.'' 
Airlines around the world are being slammed by the near total freeze in travel as countries seek to contain the 
outbreak. Carriers are forecast to lose $84 billion globally this year, which would be the industry's worst ever by far. 
Some have filed for bankruptcy or sought bailouts to survive the near-shutdown in their activity, and many are 
cutting thousands of jobs. The sector will likely take years to recover. (Ad) Get real-time analyst ratings, earnings,

for its slow response to fighting the outbreak. Many in his government, including Johnson himself, came down with

worst of the coronavirus outbreak. The government had insisted until May that putting restrictions at the border

the near-halt in air travel as a result of pandemic restrictions. Hopes to rescue some part of the summer season 
depend on the relaxation of some rules.7 Virus-Resistant Retail Stocks to Own Now[1]The U.S. economy 
contracted by 5% in the first quarter. That was slightly larger than the 4.8 decline that was previously forecast. On 
the same day that GDP was released, we also learned that the ranks of those filing for unemployment claims 
exceeded 40 million. But as sobering as those numbers are, they're not completely surprising. The U.S. economy 
was effectively shut down as citizens did their part to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. But the cost of those 
efforts is just being measured. And one of those measurements comes in the all-important Consumer Confidence 
Index. The index ticked up slightly in May to 86.6. While this number is about 30% lower than where the index sat In 
February, it's significantly higher than where it sat at the trough of the financial crisis and subsequent recession. 
And a big reason for that is that while the brick-and-mortar economy shut down, the digital economy helped give the 
economy a pulse. Consumption is a key part of our economy. That's why consumer confidence makes up 70% of 
the U.S. economy. And one of the key ways that consumers express that confidence or lack thereof, is in the retail 
sector. For the last few years, the story of retail has been about which retailers were going to be able to 
successfully compete in the e-commerce space that is still owned by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Sadly, we're 
discovering that some companies, like J.C. Penney, were late to adapt in a meaningful way. But that isn't the case 
for all retailers. In this special presentation, we are identifying 7 retail stocks that have done well through this

virus risk, Trump gets back to business as usual — The European Union urged all its member countries to start 
lifting travel restrictions on their common borders from next week, saying that the closures they introduced to tackle 
the coronavirus do little to limit its spread. — Among the numerous rural areas across the U.S. that have recently 
experienced coronavirus outbreaks are migrant farmworker communities in Florida. Immokalee is one of them. The 
poor town of 25,000 north of the Everglades has become a hot spot, with cases more than doubling in the past two 
weeks.  — Surgeons in Chicago have given a new set of lungs to a young woman with severe lung damage from

ELSE IS HAPPENING TODAY: MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte has been promised by his 
Chinese counterpart that the Philippines 'as a friendly neighbor' will be prioritized when China is able to develop a 
vaccine against COVID-19. Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Friday that Duterte got the assurance from 
Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a late Thursday telephone call that lasted 38 minutes. Roque said Xi assured Duterte 
of 'his country's commitment to make the vaccine available for all, adding that the Philippines, as a friendly 
neighbor, would certainly be a priority.' ___ ISLAMABAD — Pakistan has reported 107 more COVID-19 deaths and 
6,397 new cases, the highest single-day increase. It brought Pakistan's tally to 2,463 deaths among 125,933 
The Latest: 3 airlines challenge UK quarantine in court
confirmed cases. The government said Friday that 40,247 patients have recovered. Experts say Pakistan may 
witness a further rise in COVID-19 cases. They say the disease has spread across the country since last month 
when Prime Minister Imran Khan eased lockdown, saying he was doing it to save the ailing economy and people 
from hunger and poverty. Pakistan's economy will contract in the fiscal year ending June 30, for the first time in 68 
years as a result of the global pandemic. ___ LONDON -- Official figures show that the British economy shrank by a 
colossal 20.4% in April, the first full month that the country was in its coronavirus lockdown. The Office for National 
Statistics said Friday that all areas of the economy were hit, in particular pubs, education, health and car sales. 
Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said April's fall is 'the biggest the U.K. has ever 
seen,' and 'almost 10 times larger than the steepest pre-COVID-19 fall.' April's decline follows a 5.8% contraction in 
March. In April, the economy was about a quarter smaller than it was in February. The U.K. was put into lockdown 
on March 23 and restrictions are slowly being eased. On Monday, nonessential shops, such as department stores 
and electronic retailers, are due to reopen. ___ CANBERRA, Australia — Australia's prime minister expects 
international students will begin returning in July despite warnings of racism from China. Prime Minister Scott 
Morrison said after meeting federal state leaders on Friday that international students would be allowed to come to 
Australia under approved plans to study at nominated institutions. Morrison said he expected all state borders to 
reopen in July, with the possible exception of Western Australia. International students have been Australia's most 
lucrative industry after mining, with China the largest source of foreign students. China this week warned its citizens 
of the risk of pandemic-related racism if they traveled to Australia. Last month, China banned beef imports from 
Australia and ended trade in Australian barley through massive tariffs in what is widely regarded as retaliation for 
Australia calling for an investigation into the pandemic. Foreign Minister Marise Payne on Friday accused China of 
'disinformation' through its racism warning. Morrison said he was not concerned that Chinese government warnings 
could deter Chinese students.  ___ NEW DELHI— India's coronavirus caseload has become the fourth-highest in 
the world, overtaking Britain, by adding 10,956 new cases in yet another biggest single-day spike. India's two-
month lockdown kept transmission low but in a large population of 1.3 billion, people remain susceptible and the 
campaign against the virus is likely to go on for months, Balram Bhargava, director-general of the Indian Council of 
Medical Research, said. India's lockdown was imposed nationwide in late March but has eased since, and it is now 
largely being enforced in high-risk areas. The new cases rose after India reopened shops, shopping malls, 
manufacturing and religious places.  Subways, schools and movie theaters remain closed. The increase reported 
Friday raised India's confirmed cases to 297,535 with 8,498 deaths.  ___ SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea is 
reporting 56 new cases of COVID-19 as the country continues to see a resurgence of the virus concentrated in the 
capital area. Figures released by South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday brought 
national totals to 12,003 cases and 277 deaths. It says 10,699 people have so far been released from hospitals 
after recovery, but 1,057 others remain in treatment.  At least 45 of the new cases were reported from the Seoul 
metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea's 51 million people live. Health officials have struggled to track 
transmissions linked to entertainment and leisure activities, church gatherings and low-income workers who couldn't 
afford to stay home. ___ RENO, Nevada — Nevada health officials are closely monitoring a recent uptick in 
confirmed COVID-19 cases statewide, including the biggest one-day increase to date in the Reno area reported 
Thursday. But the state's response director isn't convinced a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak has arrived. 
Nevada COVID-19 Response Director Caleb Cage says the state has seen an above-average rise in daily positive 
cases this week and experienced six consecutive days of an increase in the number of cases requiring 
hospitalization. He says the most recent spike is the fourth highest since the pandemic was declared in mid-March 
in Nevada, which now has nearly 10,400 cases and 458 deaths. But Cage adds that 'our assessment based on this 
data is that we are not seeing evidence of a second wave of COVID-19 in the state of Nevada yet.' ___ BEIJING — 
China has reported seven new coronavirus cases, including the first instance of local transmission in Beijing in 
weeks. Authorities said Friday that the other six cases were all brought into the country by Chinese citizens arriving 
from abroad. No new deaths were reported. Officials in Beijing say the locally transmitted case involves a 52-year-
old man who arrived alone at a clinic displaying an intermittent fever but no other symptoms. He was swiftly 
diagnosed as having COVID-19, prompting authorities to isolate family members and reinstate anti-virus measures 
in his neighborhood. The man said he had not left Beijing Beijing for more than two weeks and had not been in 
contact with anyone from outside the city. ___ GRAHAM, N.C. — A North Carolina judge has ordered a small stock 
car track to halt racing after state health officials declared that large weekend crowds at recent races violated an 
executive order by Gov. Roy Cooper aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus. The judge agreed Thursday to 
issue a temporary restraining order preventing Ace Speedway in Alamance County from holding further events for 
The Latest: 3 airlines challenge UK quarantine in court
now. Earlier this week, the state health secretary called the track an 'imminent hazard,' ordered it closed and told 
the operators to announce the closure publicly. There was no evidence the owners did that, so officals asked the 
court to intervene. The governor's restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus limit outdoor gatherings to 25 
people. ___ SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Puerto Rico's governor says she will lift nearly all restrictions aimed at 
curbing coronavirus cases, which means beaches, churches and businesses across the U.S. territory will reopen 
after a three-month shutdown. Gov. Wanda Vzquez said Thursday the changes will occur starting next week. She 
says businesses including gyms and movie theaters will be allowed to operate seven days a week. However, she 
says an overnight curfew will remain in place for two weeks, with people required to be inside from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.  
The governor also says that Puerto Rico will begin welcoming tourists again starting July 15 and that airport 
screenings will continue. ___ GENEVA — Geneva's most famous landmark, the towering fountain known as the Jet 
d'Eau, has fired back up after an 83-day stoppage amid broad lockdown measures for the coronavirus outbreak. It 
was the longest such pause since the spray began operations in 1951. The head of the Geneva-based World 
Health Organization took part in a reopening ceremony Thursday that epitomized the recent easing of restrictive 
measures as case counts of COVID-19 have fallen dramatically in Switzerland. The Geneva utility that operates the

onto Lake Geneva.8 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now[1]Dividend stocks are always in fashion. Income investors find 
that dividend stocks can be a replacement for low-yielding Treasury bonds and other bond options. But dividend 
stocks can also play a role in the growth investor's portfolio. Dividend stocks by nature tend to lag behind the 
broader market. This is due to the nature of the companies that issue dividends. In many cases, these are mature 
companies who have the liquidity to not only use profits for growth but also to reward shareholders. However, in a 
bull market dividend stocks can also provide a significant amount of growth. This can provide investors of all styles 
with a nice total return. For those that are new to dividend stocks, it's important to know what to look for in a 
dividend stock. Yield is important, but it's not everything. What you're looking for is a company that has a proven 
history of not only issuing dividends but ideally increasing the amount of those dividends on an annual basis. In this 
presentation, we'll highlight eight dividend stocks in various sectors that are the best to buy. And for most of these 
stocks, they're a good buy today and well into the future. View the "8 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now"[2]. [ 1]:

Britain published new guidance for airlines and airports on how to operate safely to minimize the risks from 
coronavirus, adding to hopes that the country will soon agree deals to allow quarantine-free travel.
Passengers and staff should wear face coverings in airports and on aircraft, while passengers should check in all 
luggage including hand bags and remain seated for as much of the flight as possible, said the Department for 
Transport on Thursday.
Since the outbreak of coronavirus, there has been minimal flying into and out of Britain. Airlines had been hoping for 
a recovery in July, but they say new UK rules requiring international arrivals to quarantine for 14-days have pushed 
this back.
Britain has said work is continuing on "air bridges" between countries with low infection rates, something which the 
industry says is vital to kickstart travel demand and avoid further job losses on top of the tens of thousands already 
announced.
The new aviation guidance shows the government is preparing for a restart.
"We are taking the necessary steps to ensure a framework is in place for the aviation industry to bounce back when 
it is safe for restrictions on travel to be lifted," said transport minister Grant Shapps in a statement.
Many airlines including easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways have already said that customers must wear face 
coverings onboard.
The guidance to put most baggage in the hold could be problematic for some low-cost airlines such as Ryanair 
which formerly charged a premium for customers to keep larger bags with them in the cabin.
The government also said in its guidance that there should be extensive cleaning of the aircraft, and more 
availability of handwashing and hand sanitizer facilities.

Buzz (RR, Warsaw Modlin) has confirmed it is in "advanced talks" with Czech tour operators about possible charter 
flights to leisure destinations in the Canary Islands and Morocco starting this November, with further destinations in 
the Mediterranean due to be added in 2021. "Buzz is in advanced discussions with key tour operators and with 
Ryanair Group to expand its services from Prague Václav Havel to include many more destinations in Greece, 
Turkey, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and North Africa for Summer 2021," Chief Executive Michal Kaczmarzyk said. The 
Polish unit of Ryanair Holdings launched as a passenger charter specialist in 2018 under the original name, Ryanair 
Sun. While it continues to provide passenger charter flights on behalf of Polish tour operators, it has since started 
operating scheduled flights on behalf of Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), initially out of its Polish bases and then gradually 
expanding to other cities, including Prague. It said it was "in discussions with the Ryanair Group to substantially 
increase the number of Prague routes next year from its existing 33 routes". Buzz currently operates forty-seven 
B737-800s, the ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows.

International routes can be central to Poland's economic recovery but only if aircraft passenger restrictions are 
scrapped, industry leaders have warned.
Representatives from the aviation industry in Poland have written an open letter to Prime Minister Mateusz 
Morawiecki urging a loosening of air travel restrictions so that the restoration of international routes can become a 
"cornerstone" of the country's economic recovery.
Poland was among the first European countries to impose a strict lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus, 
with the country's borders effectively closing on March 15. Since then, restrictions have been gradually eased. 
Limited domestic air services resumed on June 1.
The country plans to reopen its borders to other EU countries on June 13, with scheduled international flights 
restarting three days later. However, an order published in late May by Poland's Council of Ministers states that the 
number of passengers permitted on aircraft operating domestic and passenger routes must be limited to 50% of 
their capacity.
Presidents of seven Polish airports alongside Jozsef Varadi and Michal Kaczmarzyk, the CEOs of Wizz Air and 
Ryanair's Buzz respectively, have now called on Morawiecki's government to scrap the restrictions, arguing they go 
beyond guidelines recommended by EASA.
The joint letter says the planned rules would be "synonymous with the outbreak of another pandemic." It adds: "This 
time, however, it will be a deadly virus for the entire Polish aviation market, which will not be missed by national 
carrier LOT."
It also argues that the restrictions would cause the cost of air tickets to double, as well as strengthening the 
competitiveness of regional airports located close to the Polish border, particularly in Berlin and Ostrava.
"The rapid restoration of international air connections should be a cornerstone of the country's economic recovery 
strategy and its future development," the letter says.
"But airports will not be able to contribute to the recovery of the country's economy if national regulations restrict the 
possibility conducting business activity with air carriers and [result in] airlines withdrawing from the Polish market."
Poland's restrictions will be deadly for the aviation industry
The letter concludes that Morawiecki should enforce COVID-19 safety regulations recommended by European 
regulators, but that he must take a "wise and prudent" approach so that the rules are not too restrictive.
State-owned LOT Polish Airlines resumed domestic flights on June 1, operating a limited schedule that includes 3X-
daily Warsaw (WAW)-Gdansk (GDN) service and up to 2X-daily flights from WAW to Krakow (KRK), Poznan (POZ), 
Rzeszow (RZE), Szczecin (SZZ), Wroclaw (WRO) and Zielona Gora (IEG).
However, the Star Alliance member continues to sell only 50% of the aircraft's capacity in order to maintain "a 
chessboard-like spatial distance." Meanwhile, ground handling staff and cabin crew serving passengers during 
flights wear protective equipment, such as masks and gloves.

U ntil not too long ago, investing in the airline industry was viewed by many as not much better than setting fire to 
money.
Such has been the pain suffered by generations of operators and their shareholders that rueful observations by 
several high-profile investors have almost become business clichés.
How do you become a millionaire, quipped Richard Branson? Start as a billionaire and buy an airline. Warren 
Buffett wrote in Berkshire Hathaway's 2007 letter to shareholders that "if a farsighted capitalist had been present at 
Kitty Hawk [the site of the Wright Brothers' first flight], he would have done his successors a huge favour by 
shooting Orville [Wright] down".
Indeed from 1960 to 2000, the aggregate profits of the US airline industry would have been enough to pay for the 
delivery of just two 747 jumbo jets. After the 2008 financial crisis, things changed. A wave of mergers between US 
airlines resulted in rapid consolidation.
As the market became less fragmented and operating models leaner, it started to appear that the US airline 
industry would become reliably profitable for the first time in its history. Operating margins moved from negative to 
positive. Shares in Delta Air Lines rose fourfold from the start of 2009 to the start of 2015. United rose by more than 
5.5 times. The "Great Consolidation" had occurred, and even Mr Buffett came to decide that - this time - things 
would be different. In 2016, in a move that shocked his acolytes, he bought stakes in the four largest US airlines.
Why Europe may never follow the US airline industry's path INSIDE BUSINESS EUROPE
Investors came to believe that a more consolidated industry would behave in a more predictable fashion and that 
the remaining operators would refrain from brutal price wars that flooded the market with seats and cheap tickets. If 
they all kept in line, all would benefit.
Over recent years, investors and analysts in European airlines have eyed the transformation in the US and started 
to dream that, maybe, the same Great Consolidation could be possible across the Atlantic.
Investors came believe that a Unlike in the US, market share in Europe is still highly fragmented, with incumbent 
formerly stateowned airlines competing with big low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and easyJet, and other smaller 
ones.
consolidated would behave predictable Mark Manduca, a Citi analyst who has long believed that European 
consolidation is inevitable, noted at the start of this year, before the pandemic hit, that there was evidence of a 
slowing in capacity growth in European shorthaul, and a widening gap between stronger airlines and weaker ones 
that would end up failing or being merged.
"Simply put," he wrote at the start of the year, "in European aviation history we have yet to see a period (such as 
now) when four airlines control so much of the profits of the industry."
These "Big Four", Air France-KLM, IAG, Lufthansa and Ryanair, would increasingly take market share from a 
"subscale tail" of lossmaking airlines, and the industry would start over the next five years to follow what happened 
in the US.
The industry crisis caused by the pandemic has reminded investors of the ugliest things about the European airline 
sector. So-called "barriers to exit" in airlines have always been high, with operators having to make such huge 
capital outlays that they are often compelled to run flights even if they are lossmaking, just to keep cash flowing 
through the business in the short term.
In Europe the situation is worse, because governments are often unwilling to countenance their national carrier 
www.disappearing.No matter how much money Alitalia loses, for example, no Italian government has considered it 
acceptable simply to let it fail.
The frustrations of Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, who last month accused German rival Lufthansa of "hoovering up 
state aid like a drunken uncle at a wedding", are a pained acknowledgment that European government cash is 
vastly distorting for the sector. It also makes further mergers complicated.
In the wake of the crisis, as Mr Manduca of Citi has noted, short-haul capacity will contract. Some weaker airlines 
are in difficulties. The strong, such as the "Big Four", and some others will survive and probably, in time, become 
stronger. The problem in the short term is the likely price war that will break out as people start flying again this 
summer.
This is good for consumers, obviously.
But for investors, Europe's Great Consolidation looks likely to be postponed for many years, while the more 
profitable future they have been dreaming of remains elusively over the horizon.

 Ryanair (RYAAY), an Irish airline, on Thursday rejected UK's guidance on passengers having to check in all 
luggage including handbags, Reuters reported the same day.
Ryanair said it would recommend customers to minimize checked-in luggage. Carrying handbags also limit contact 
with any person since they are being handled by the owners.
Separately, the airline plans to bring back 40% of normal scheduled flights starting July 1, subject to the 
government's lift of restrictions on flights and proper health measures at the airport.

But for investors, Europe's Great Consolidation looks likely to be postponed for many years, while the more 
profitable future they have been dreaming of remains elusively over the horizon.

Jun 11, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  LATAM Airlines Group 
S.A. LTM[1] reported bland traffic numbers for May, primarily due to weak air travel demand stemming from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) deteriorated as traffic plunge outweighed 
capacity contraction.Consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) of LATAM Airlines 
tanked 96.5% on a year-over-year basis. As this carrier trimmed capacity to cope with the bleak demand scenario, 
consolidated capacity (measured in available seat miles/ASMs) plunged 93.3%. Meanwhile, consolidated load 
factor dropped 39.8 percentage points to 43.8%. Passenger count too slumped 96.7%.During the first five months 
of 2020, LATAM Airlines generated RPKs of 29,438 million (down 42.8% year over year) and ASMs of 36,913 
million (down 39.8% year over year). Load factor declined 4.2 percentage points year over year to 79.8%. 
Passenger count at LATAM Airlines fell 38.9% in the January-May period.LATAM Airlines Group S.A. Price

Wizz 's new summer flights near 150

Thirteen more routes have been added to Wizz Air's summer schedule, taking the total number of new services 
being launched by the Central and Eastern Europe ULCC close to the 150 mark.
Fresh from unveiling plans to open four bases and launch more than 50 new routes, Hungarian carrier Wizz Air is 
planning further network expansion this summer season.
The ULCC has scheduled an additional 13 new route launches over the coming weeks, including four from the 
Austrian capital Vienna, as the airline continues to defy the industry downturn brought on by the COVID-19 
pandemic.
The latest expansion takes the number of new routes being opened by Wizz in summer 2020 to 138, while its UK 
subsidiary is launching 11. The full list of new services has been published today on Airlineroute.
New additions to Wizz's network include a 2X-weekly service from Bucharest (OTP) to Heraklion (HER), as well as 
flights from Hungary's capital Budapest (BUD) to Mahon (MAH) in Menorca and Thira (JTR) in Santorini. Both the 
new BUD routes will be 2X-weekly.
The airline will link Chisinau (KIV) in Moldova with Basel Mulhouse (BSL), Hamburg (HAM) and Nice (NCE), each of 
which will be 2X-weekly, while Krakow (KRK)-Stockholm Skavsta (NYO) Sofia (SOF)- Frankfurt-Hahn (HHN) and 
Varna (VAR)-Prague (PRG) are also being launched. KRK-NYO will be 3X-weekly, and SOF-HHN and VAR-PRG 
will be twice per week.
The final four routes are from Vienna (VIE). Wizz will serve Barcelona (BCN) and OTP with 5X-weekly flights each, 
and offer 2X-weekly services to both MAH and JTR.
Wizz's expansion from VIE means that the carrier is opening 20 new routes from Austria's capital this summer and 
comes at a time when rival Lauda is restructuring its operations at the airport.
Lauda, Austria's second largest airline behind Austrian Airlines, last month said it was closing its VIE base, where it 
has 300 pilots and cabin crew stationed, after failing to reach an agreement with unions on pay.
However, the Ryanair-owned carrier has this week reversed the decision and will resume operations from VIE on 
July 1, initially with three Airbus A320s, increasing to ten by August.
Wizz 's new summer flights near 150
Speaking on a call with analysts last week following the publication of its annual financial results, Wizz CEO József 
Váradi said the ULCC was concentrating on its traditional heartland but is alive to opportunities in Western Europe 
and the Middle East.
"We remain focused on Central and Eastern Europe but, as we have said before, there will be some opportunities 
going west and some opportunities going east," he explained. "The western direction is largely motivated by market 
consolidation opportunities."
Wizz announced plans in May to open a new base at Milan Malpensa (MXP), stationing five aircraft in the Italian 
city and launching 20 new routes. Bases are also opening in Larnaca (LCA) in Cyprus; Lviv (LWO) in Ukraine, and 
Tirana (TIA) in Albania.
In addition, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, a joint venture with Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company, plans to begin 
operations this year and will launch with six aircraft, double the number originally planned.

Jun 10, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Germany's 
largest airline, Lufthansa, could cut[1] as many as 26,000 jobs amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The 
company is undergoing restructuring after it received a 9 billion euro[2] ($10.26 billion) bailout from the German 
government on May 25.As part of the bailout, Berlin would receive a 20% stake in the airline. 
Lufthansa originally pledged to cut 10,000 jobs as part of the restructuring process, but now the carrier says the job 
cuts will be 'significantly more' than thatfigure.The coronavirus pandemic has caused a drop in demand for air 
travel, pushing many companies on the verge of bankruptcy.On April 25, the U.S. Treasury said it would disburse 
an additional $9.5 billion in payroll support to U.S.-based airlines affected by the crisis. Washington has so far 
allocated at least $12.4 billion in aid[3] to the airline sector.Lufthansa, in terms of passengers carried, is the second-
largest airline in Europe, behind low-cost carrier Ryanair. The company, which was founded in 1953, gets itsname 
comes from 'Luft,' the German word for "air" and 'Hansa,' for the Hanseatic League[4]. During the 2019 fiscal year, 
Lufthansa was in the top 30 publicly traded German companies[5] by market capitalizationGermany's economy has 
been hit hard by the coronavirus. German GDP decreased by 2.2% [6]in the first quarter of the year. [ 1]:

Highlight: Gatwick Airport in the UK is preparing to reopen its North Terminal next week to accommodate more 
flights as airlines ramp up their programmes.
Body
Airlines including easyJet, Wizz Air, Ryanair, Belavia, Vueling and Blue Island are set to restart flights from the 
North Terminal on 15 June. The airport will also extend its operating hours to 6am-10pm. 
As part of the North Terminal reopening, Gatwick has launched a range of Covid-19 protective measures to ensure 
the safety of its passengers and staff. These include the requirements for both passengers and staff to wear masks 
within the airport. To promote hygiene, face mask vending machines will be installed at the airport, along with hand 
sanitising stations and hand washing facilities. Deep cleaning of common-use surfaces will also be implemented 
throughout the airport as part of the measures, with dedicated teams working to respond to passenger concerns on 
cleanliness. In addition, mandatory social distancing procedures and the installation of Perspex screens are also 
planned at check-in desks, gate rooms and departure halls. Gatwick Airport chief executive Stewart Wingate said: 
"Having remained open throughout this pandemic, the wellbeing and safety of our passengers and everyone that 
works at the airport remains our top priority. "We have introduced a range of new social distancing and hygiene 
solutions to help this happen so we can all help protect each other when travelling through the airport. We want 
people to understand that airports and air travel is a safe environment in this Covid-19 travelling world. In addition to 
the existing passenger guidance available on its website and passenger app, Gatwick has introduced digital and 
physical signage advising passengers of the new health measures. A new film has also been launched by the 
airport to provide passengers with information about its new guidance and what to expect.

content/uploads/2020/06/Arrivals.pngTravel corridors allowing unrestricted movement between Britain and some 
other countries will open from 29 June, a UK tourism lobby group said on Tuesday (9 June), citing assurances it 
said it received from senior government sources, writes Sarah Young. 
Britain introduced a 14-day quarantine for international arrivals on Monday despite warnings from airlines, airports 
and others that this could lead to more job losses just when they were hoping to launch a recovery from COVID-19. 
Quash Quarantine, representing 500 travel and hospitality companies, said in a statement on Tuesday it had been 
told privately that travel corridors, a means of allowing quarantine-free trips, would be in place later this month. 
Government ministers have publicly said they are considering travel corridors, or so-called 'air bridges' with 
countries with low infection rates, but there have not been any formal deals so far. Airlines want the quarantine rule 
scrapped altogether. British Airways (ICAG.L[1]) has teamed up with low-cost rivals Ryanair (RYA.I[2]) and easyJet 
(EZJ.L[3]) with a plan to launch legal action to try to overturn it, and legal papers could be filed on Tuesday. Quash 
Quarantine said it had not ruled out pursuing legal action itself. 'We are still considering our options regarding legal 
action, including whether to join BA's claim or launch our own action, but would prefer that 29th Juneis confirmed as 
soon as possible for the start of travel corridors,' Quash Quarantine's spokesman Paul Charles said. Popular 
holiday destinations for British tourists include Portugal, Spain, France, Greece and Italy. [ 1]:

Jun 10, 2020( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com Delivered by Newstex)  On June 1, 2020, Judge Paul Oetken of 
the Southern District of New York granted in part and denied in part a motion to dismiss securities claims against an 
'ultra-low fare' airline company (the 'Company') and its chief executive. City of Birmingham Firemen's and 
Policemen's Supplemental Pension System v. Ryanair Holdings plc et al., No. 18-cv-10330 (S.D.N.Y. June 1, 
2020). Plaintiffs alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
'Exchange Act'), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, in connection with alleged misstatements concerning the 
Company's labor practices and profitability. The Court granted in part defendants' motion to dismiss, finding 
plaintiffs failed to adequately plead falsity, materiality, and scienter for all but one category of alleged 
misstatements, but granted plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend.The Company is a low-cost airline operator based 
out of Europe. Plaintiffs alleged that, in order to offer competitive pricing, the Company minimized costs in 
personnel, equipment, customer service, airport access, and handling costs. According to the complaint, 
defendants misled the market regarding their labor practices, specifically representing that the Company would not 
unionize and did not face problems with hiring or retention. 
Plaintiffs alleged that, despite these representations, the Company announced in December 2017 that it would in 
fact recognize unions for pilots and crew. The Company faced labor disruptions over the following year, leading to 
flight cancellations, but allegedly maintained that the strikes 'would not significantly impact its business model.' 
Plaintiffs alleged that ultimately, in October 2018, the Company disclosed a 'thirty-two percent increase in personnel 
costs and a twelve percent fall in projected earnings.' According to the complaint, defendants made materially false 
and misleading statements about the Company's labor practices, profitability, growth targets, and likelihood of 
unionization.Regarding the alleged falsity and materiality of the Company's statements concerning its labor 
practices, plaintiffs alleged the Company misrepresented its competitiveness as an employer by representing that it 
was able to attract pilots and crew with 'industry leading job security and pay, excellent working conditions, 
excellent rosters, and unrivalled career progression' in an attempt to reassure the market given the labor 
disruptions. The Court, however, agreed with defendants that these statements were inactionable as 'quintessential 
'puffery'' and would not have been material as a reasonable investor would not have considered such statements to 
Southern District Of New York Grants In Part Motion To Dismiss Securities Fraud Claims Against European 
Airline For Failure To Adequately Allege Falsity, Materi....
have 'significantly altered the 'total mix' of information made available.' Turning to allegations that statements 
regarding flight cancellations and labor shortages were false based on a letter by an employee to the individual 
defendant, various analyst reports, and the resignation of the Company's COO—the Court acknowledged that these 
statements were 'too specific to qualify as puffery,' but nevertheless failed to demonstrate the statements' falsity. 
The Court did, however, hold that defendants' statements regarding unionization—specifically, 'the statements 
indicating a near certainty that [the Company] would not recognize employee unions'—were 'impossible to reconcile 
with [the CEO's] subsequent admission that he had 'long anticipated' unionization.' Noting that such admission was 
'direct evidence of Defendants' knowledge of the true likelihood of unionization at the time they made the 
statements denying the existence of any likelihood,' the Court held that such statements were sufficiently pled to be 
materially false or misleading.The Court also addressed the alleged misstatements regarding the Company's 
profitability. Plaintiffs contended that defendants misrepresented the effect of two events—a decision by the 
European Court of Justice holding that the Company's employees may be entitled to bring their claims in local 
courts rather than solely in Irish courts, and the Company's decision to 'recognize employee unions'—and their 
impact on the Company's profits. The Company allegedly predicted that the European Court of Justice decision 
'would not require an increase in pay and . . . would not 'change [the Company's] cost base by one cent.'' The Court 
noted that plaintiffs failed to allege any facts specifically indicating that defendants possessed evidence that their 
predictions were wrong or misleading, and as such failed to demonstrate falsity of such statements. Plaintiffs also 
alleged that defendants downplayed the costs of unionization, but the Court rejected plaintiffs' argument holding 
that plaintiffs failed to plead with requisite specificity that defendants knew such statements were false and cited to 
'flimsy evidence' such as pilot complaints prior to unionization in an attempt to establish that the Company 
understood it to be a foregone conclusion that unionization would lead to adverse consequences. The Court held 
that plaintiffs' remaining arguments regarding such statements similarly failed to sufficiently allege defendants knew 
allowing employees to unionize would have a material effect on operational flexibility and therefore affect 
costs.Concerning the alleged statements concerning the Company's growth targets, the Court found that 'once 
more, [plaintiffs] fail[ed] to plead the falsity of these statements.' In particular, the Court found that plaintiffs failed to 
cite specific evidence demonstrating that the Company issued misleading statements regarding its growth target of 
200 million passengers by March 2024 by failing to disclose that unionization would be required to allow expansion 
into union-friendly markets. The Court observed that the alleged statements to which plaintiffs cited—such as the 
opinions of financial analysts and post-unionization statements by the individual defendant—failed to demonstrate 
whether defendants knew when they established the growth target and issued such statements that unionization 
would be necessary.As to plaintiffs' scienter allegations, the Court held that plaintiffs failed to allege defendants had 
fraudulent motive or opportunity to establish the requisite scienter, noting that the evidence cited by plaintiffs—'the 
existence of insider stock sales' by the individual defendant—was unconvincing. The Court observed that plaintiffs 
point only to the individual defendant's stock sales but not purchases, demonstrating 'only gross proceeds without 
identifying net profits.' In further rejecting the scienter allegations, the Court highlighted that defendant's sales 
comprised 'only twelve percent of his . . . stock holdings' and he 'retained the vast majority of his stock holdings,' 
thereby undermining plaintiffs' allegations that the individual defendant 'was motivated to commit fraud.'Separately, 
the Court considered whether plaintiffs had adequately alleged scienter under the conscious misbehavior or 
recklessness prong, stressing that such allegations must be particularized and indicate actual intent to commit fraud 
or conscious recklessness. The Court held that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged scienter regarding defendants' alleged 
statements concerning unionization for the same reason such statements were materially false or misleading—
namely, that they represented near certainty that the Company would not recognize employee unions, but 
defendants later admitted that unionization was 'long anticipated' and as such was 'direct evidence' of defendants' 
'knowledge of the true likelihood of unionization at the time they made the statements denying the existence of any 
likelihood.' However, the Court held that with respect to all other alleged misstatements, plaintiffs 'failed to raise a 
strong inference of intent.' In so holding, the Court rejected plaintiffs' reliance on the 'core operations,' noting that it 
is 'questionable' whether the core operations doctrine is good law after the enactment of the PSLRA, and that the 
doctrine 'standing alone' can at most be 'supplemental support' for scienter but 'does not independently establish' it. 
The Court also found plaintiffs' other arguments for scienter unconvincing and held that evidence of the allegedly 
'suspicious' resignation of the COO, the 'timing and context' of the alleged misstatements, and the 'magnitude of the 
alleged fraud' all failed to adequately support a strong inference of scienter. Accordingly, the Court dismissed all 
claims relying on these categories of statements, holding that all but the statements regarding the likelihood of 
Southern District Of New York Grants In Part Motion To Dismiss Securities Fraud Claims Against European 
Airline For Failure To Adequately Allege Falsity, Materi....
unionization were inactionable.With respect to plaintiffs' control person liability claims under Section 20(a) of the 
Exchange Act, the Court dismissed these claims finding that plaintiffs failed to allege a primary violation except 
those in connection with the alleged misstatements concerning unionization.Links &#38; Downloads -City of

Jun 10, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  The aviation and tourism industries 
condemned the United Kingdom's decision to introduce a 14-day quarantine for international travellers. Last month, 
the government announced[1] that, from June 8, all international arrivals, including returning Britons, will have to 
self-isolate and provide details of where they will be staying. Critics, however, say the introduction of the quarantine 
has come too late, and many believe it would be ineffective. Earlier this week, Ryanair's boss Micheal O'Leary said 
the airline will not cancel flights to and from the UK, and accused[2] ministers of making the quarantine plan up as 
they go along.: 'British people are ignoring this quarantine, they know it's rubbish', he said. British Airways, EasyJet 
and Ryanair have jointly written to the government applying for a judicial review, arguing that the quarantine rules 
are disproportionate. IAG has complained that airlines were not consulted about the move. The government has 
been heavily criticised for its slow response to the pandemic. It did not close the borders, screen international 
arrivals or test travelers during the worst of the outbreak, and instead insisted until May that putting restrictions at 
the border would not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus. [ 1]:

Jun 10, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Allegiant Travel 
Company ALGT[1] reported bland traffic numbers for May, primarily due to weak air travel demand stemming from 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Traffic for scheduled service, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), plunged 
70.1% on a year-over-year basis to 32.7 million. Scheduled capacity, calculated in available seat miles (ASMs), 
also fell 47.2% to 690.6 million in the month.Since the decline in traffic exceeded capacity reduction, load factor 
(percentage of seats filled with passengers) plunged 3630 basis points year over year to 47.3%.The number of 
departures for scheduled service declined 48.8% on a year-over-year basis. However, average stage length 
(average distance flown per aircraft departure) climbed 1.5% to 856 miles in the same month. For the total system 
(including scheduled service and fixed fee contract), number of departures fell 49.1%, while the average stage

Italy will have to review its plan to nationalise and relaunch Alitalia (AZ, Rome Fiumicino) as a leaner airline if the 
European Commission decides not to approve it, the business daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported. European Competition 
Commissioner Margrethe Vestager reportedly told the Italian government that the relaunch as it stands is not 
acceptable and requested an alternative plan. The European Commission would typically oppose such state 
intervention. 
Still, given the unprecedented crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic and the fact that Alitalia is running out of 
cash, Rome had assumed it would be unlikely Brussels would complain. But Vestager made it clear that the 
commission was still investigating two state loans of EUR900 million euros (USD1.1 billion when it was provided in 
2017) and EUR400 million (USD443 million) provided at the start of this year. The Italian government has not yet 
decided what to do, the newspaper said, as coming up with a new structure for the relaunch could lead to a delay of 
several months. The next 15 days will be decisive for the take-off of the NewCo, the country's transport minister, 
Paola De Micheli, said on June 6, according to Il Sole 24 Ore, and the start of the new company's construction 
phase is "imminent." "There is a path foreseen by the relaunch decree [published on March 16] that will take place 
according to the provisions of the law," she said, adding that this procedure was likely to take 40 to 50 days. "We 
are working, and we will decide together very soon." The reworked airline will have "over 100 planes", and the 
human resources will be proportionate to this size, De Micheli stressed. Together with the Italian civil aviation 
authority (Ente Nazionale per l'Aviazione Civile - ENAC), the ministry is also working simultaneously on a new 
strategic plan for Italy's airports, something that will take "a few months" to achieve, she said. Also on June 6, 
Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) CEO Michael O'Leary told the Italian daily La Repubblica that his company was "ready to 
file a lawsuit in Brussels for unlawful state aid to save Alitalia." The Italian government is deploying "North Korea-
style rules" to save its flag carrier, he protested, adding that he was trying to meet with Italian Prime Minister 
Giuseppe Conte to discuss what he called the "protectionist attitude" in Italy.

Jun 09, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] failed to achieve its targeted traffic of 154 million for fiscal 2020 due to the coronavirus-induced travel-
demand slump. It was close to the target even as late as March. Nevertheless, the airline's fiscal 2020 traffic of 149 
million (up 4% year over year) is encouraging given the low capacity from the grounding of the more fuel-efficient 
B737 MAX jets and the coronavirus outbreak.Ryanair's stringent cost-cutting measures support its growth potential. 
The company reduced its average weekly cash burn rate to around €60 million in May, from approximately €200 
million in March.The carrier's expansion initiatives fortify its global presence. For instance, in 2019, the airline 
acquired Malta Air — a start-up carrier. Malta Air's fleet consists of around 120 aircraft. Since becoming part of 
Ryanair, the airline has been able to establish a strong presence in France, Germany, Italy and Malta. In 2018, 
Ryanair purchased the Austrian airline Laudamotion. Once the virus concerns stabilize, we expect the carrier to 
resume its expansion efforts.With a sound financial position, Ryanair should be able to come off the crisis strong 
enough. Notably, the carrier's cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal 2020 was €2.57 billion, way above the 
short-term debt figure of €382.3 million, implying that the company has enough cash to meet its short-term debt 
burden.With easing coronavirus-led travel restrictions, shares of Ryanair have surged more than 48% in a month's 
time. The carrier has been seeing a rise in flight bookings lately. Last month, the airline's CEO Michael O'Leary 
stated that there is a 'big surge in bookings[2]' on its flights out of Ireland and the UK to Spain, Portugal and Italy. 
Given these positives, we believe the time is ripe for investors to add the Ryanair stock to their portfolio, as is 
suggested by its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks 
here[3].Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation[4] sector are Scorpio Tankers Inc. 
STNG[5], Teekay Tankers Ltd. TNK[6] and Frontline Ltd FRO[7]. While Scorpio Tankers and Frontline sport a 
Zacks Rank #1, Teekay Tankers carries a Zacks Rank #2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Scorpio Tankers' 
current-year earnings has been revised upward in excess of 100% in the past 60 days.The Zacks Consensus 
Estimate for Teekay Tanker's current-year earnings has been revised 35.6% upward in the past 60 days.The Zacks

Jun 09, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Union Pacific 
Corporation UNP[1] issued a downbeat forecast for overall volumes at the Deutsche Bank Annual Global Industrials 
and Materials Summit, mainly due to coronavirus-related issues. Additionally, the company's chief financial officer 
Jennifer Hamann stated that overall volumes for the second quarter of 2020 decreased 22% on a year-over-year 
basis (through Jun 2, 2020).This unfavorable reading can be primarily attributed to double-digit declines in volumes 
at the Bulk (Grain &#38; grain products, Fertilizer, Food &#38; refrigerated, Coal &#38; renewables: down 16%), 
Premium (down 29%) and Industrial divisions (down 17%).Due to the coronavirus-induced supply-chain disruptions 
and closure of the U.S. automotive plants, Hamann stated that the overall volume decline at Union Pacific is 
estimates to be close to 20% in the June quarter. Notably, in April, management at Union Pacific had expected 
second-quarter carload volumes to plunge approximately 25% year over year due to freight softness as a result of 
the coronavirus crisis.At the above-mentioned conference, Hamann further confirmed that despite the cost-cutting 
measures undertaken by Union Pacific, operating ratio (operating expenses as a % of revenues) — a key measure 
of profitability for stocks in the railroad industry — will not improve in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. 
Notably, the metric in second-quarter 2019 was 59.6%. Per the company's latest outlook, this key measure will 
remain dull due to dismal volume projection. Notably, lower the value of the operating ratio the better.Naturally, the 
grim guidance for second-quarter overall volumes and the operating ratio disappointed investors. Consequently, the 
stock lost value in early trading.Zacks Rank &#38; Key PicksUnion Pacific currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Transportation [2]sector include Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], Air Lease

Ryanair 's Laudamotion Gets a Lifeline Following Wage Deal

Jun 09, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per a Reuters report[1], 
a wage agreement has finally been reached at Ryanair's RYAAY[2] Austrian unit, Laudamotion. This collective 
wage deal that came through at the last minute is of paramount importance as it saves more than 300 employees' 
jobs at its base in Vienna.Notably, last month, Lauda announced that it was closing down its Vienna hub following 
its failure to arrive at a pay-related pact. Even management at the parent company Ryanair had confirmed that it will 
shut down the Vienna center of its loss-making unit lest the LaudaMotion employees do not accept the salary 
cuts.The wage deal between Vida, a trade union representing workers in the transport and service industries in 
Austria, and the Austrian Chamber of Commerce was finally inked last week, which put an end to the long-standing 
negotiations between the concerned parties.Even though the deal was successful, management at Laudamotion 
stated that some jobs will be lost and the fleet of Lauda's Airbus planes at the Vienna base will be reduced to 10 
from 16[3] as the unit aims to cut costs. 
Per management, these cost synergies will enable Laudamotion to compete with the state-subsidized unit of 
German carrier Deutsche Lufthansa DLAKY[4]. Notably, Laudamotion's entire fleet, currently grounded due to the 
coronavirus pandemic, will take to the skies starting Jul 1.Zacks Rank &#38; Other Key PicksRyanair currently 
carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Investors interested in the broader Zacks Transportation [5]sector may also

Aviation, tourism groups protest UK's 14-day quarantine
Aviation, tourism groups protest UK's 14-day quarantine

LONDON (AP) - Britain began imposing a 14-day quarantine Monday on travelers coming into the country, months 
after other European countries imposed similar measures to control the spread of the coronavirus.
The quarantine was roundly criticized by the aviation and tourism industries, with many questioning its timing. 
Critics say its introduction has come too late to be useful, and some doubted it could be effectively enforced.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary called the quarantine a "political stunt" and argued that it will cause "untold 
devastation" for the country's tourism industry, not just for the airlines.
"The thousands of hotels, the thousands of visitor attractions, restaurants in the next couple of months - July and 
August are the two key months for British tourism,'' he added. "We're facing thousands of jobs losses because of a 
stupid, ineffective quarantine."
All passengers - bar a handful of exceptions like truckers or medical workers - will be asked to fill in a form detailing 
where they will self-isolate for two weeks and must give a phone number so authorities can check up on them. The 
requirement applies regardless whether they are U.K. citizens or not, and those who fail to comply could be fined.
The quarantine was imposed after a heated debate on whether it would help British efforts to tamp down the U.K. 
outbreak or simply stamp out any hopes that the British tourism industry will recover following months of lockdown.
Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the prestigious Royal Society, told the BBC the coronavirus transmission rate in 
the U.K. is still too high for the quarantine to work well.
"I would say that countries that have imposed quarantine did so either very early or after the case rate in the 
country had gone down quite a bit," he said.
British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair have written to the British government applying for a judicial review, arguing 
that the quarantine rules are disproportionate. Willie Walsh, the boss of IAG - the group that owns British Airways - 
has said that airlines were not consulted about the move.
Aviation, tourism groups protest UK's 14-day quarantine
Many other European countries are beginning to reopen their borders as their infection numbers come down.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government has been widely criticized for its slow response to fighting 
the outbreak. Many in his government, including Johnson himself, came down with coronavirus.
Britain did not close its borders, screen international arrivals or impose testing and tracing measures for travelers 
during the worst of the coronavirus outbreak. The government had insisted until May that putting restrictions at the 
border wouldn't have a significant impact on the spread of the virus in the U.K.
Figures on Monday showed that a further 55 people died after testing positive with the virus, the lowest daily rise in 
the number of coronavirus deaths in the country since late March. Britain's total death toll stood at 40,597, the 
second-highest in the world after the United States.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that while the pandemic is "clearly not over," all the data showed that the 
country is making good progress.
"Coronavirus is in retreat across the land. Our plan is working," he said.
At London's Stansted Airport on Monday, shopkeeper Netti Rexhmet, who arrived from the Netherlands, said the 
rule will prevent him from working for two weeks.
"We haven't got any other options, it's government law so I shall do it," he said, but added: "For me, I wouldn't want 
to do it. ... I've got things to do."
In other developments in Europe:
MOLDOVA SEES COVID-19 CASES SURGE: A former health minister says Moldova's coronavirus pandemic is 
"out of control" as the number of new cases keeps rising. Statistics released Monday show that Moldova registered 
1,149 new COVID-19 cases in the first week of June, the highest weekly figure since March 7, when the first case 
was registered. Former Health Minister Ala Nemerenco said on Facebook that "you don't have to be an 
epidemiologist, a virologist, or even a doctor to understand that the situation has gotten out of control." Moldova has 
registered 9,700 coronavirus cases and 346 deaths.
POLAND SHUTS 12 MINES AMID OUTBREAK: Polish authorities have ordered the closure of 12 coal mines for 
three weeks after hundreds of workers were infected with COVID-19. The measure announced Monday comes as 
coal mines in Poland's southern mining region of Silesia have become virus hot spots. Deputy Prime Minister Jacek 
Sasin says miners will receive full pay during the closure. Some 5,000 of Poland's 27,000 confirmed COVID-19 
cases are coal miners.
MOSCOW ENDS TWO-MONTH LOCKDOWN: The Russian capital is ending a tight lockdown that has been in 
place for more than two months, citing a slowdown in the coronavirus outbreak. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin 
said starting Tuesday residents will no longer be required to obtain electronic passes for travel and can walk, use 
public transport and drive without restrictions. The number of daily infections in Moscow has dropped from a peak of 
6,700 to about 2,000 recently. Meanwhile, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Monday that traveling 
abroad for work, studying, receiving medical treatment or taking care of relatives will be allowed. It wasn't 
immediately clear when the partial reopening of Russia's borders would take effect.
CYPRUS POLICE MOVES AGAINST SCOFFLAW BAR: Cypriot officials are warning against undue complacency 
in enforcing social distancing rules after video emerged of an jam-packed open-air nightclub at a popular seaside 
resort. Cyprus police spokesman Christos Andreou told The Associated Press on Monday that the Ayia Napa 
nightclub's owner faces a charge of flouting maximum capacity limits. Andreou said police are taking the owner to 
court because he was repeatedly warned over the weekend and will also seek a court order to temporarily shut 
down the club.

Ryanair to fly through 'rubbish' UK quarantine
Ryanair to fly through 'rubbish' UK quarantine

Ryanair will not cancel British flights despite Monday's start of what the boss of Europe's biggest budget airline 
called a "rubbish" 14-day quarantine for international arrivals.
Ryanair, easyJet and BA-owner IAG have threatened legal action over the quarantine, which they say will cripple 
the British tourism industry.
Asked by BBC Radio whether Ryanair would cancel July and August flights if the quarantine remained in place, 
group CEO O'Leary said: "No, because the flights are full outbound of the UK. British people are ignoring this 
quarantine, they know it's rubbish."
The three airlines have sent a "pre-action protocol letter," which can be followed by legal action, in the most 
vociferous clash between the UK government and industry since the pandemic began.
Airlines have warned it could deter British travelers, some of the top spenders, from flying to Europe and prevent 
Europeans from visiting cities such as London and Edinburgh and sites including Stonehenge.
There were 41 million visits to the UK in 2019, according to the national tourism agency, with visitors spending 28 
billion pounds ($36 billion) and supporting millions of jobs.
The head of London's Heathrow Airport, Europe's busiest, warned that millions of jobs could be lost if aviation does 
not resume quickly.
The boss of easyJet said the industry could be left in tatters, with more job cuts needed from his airline, too.
Ryanair to fly through 'rubbish' UK quarantine
The quarantine is designed to prevent a second surge of COVID-19 and in England a breach of the rules will be 
punishable with a 1,000 pound fine.
It will be reviewed every three weeks and "air bridges" that allow tourists to travel between two countries without 
needing to quarantine are being discussed with some top European destinations such as Portugal.
P&O Ferries said it had seen high levels of demand at Calais over the weekend as people tried to return before 
midnight although its efforts to return passengers were curbed by its need to limit customers on ships to allow social 
distancing.(Reuters)

Furious with the British government's "irrational" changes in its approach to tackling the coronavirus pandemic, 
British Airways (BA, London Heathrow) owner IAG International Airlines Group is considering mounting a legal 
challenge against its quarantine plans and is reviewing the situation with lawyers. Airlines with significant British 
operations had hoped to resume flights from July, but a 14-day quarantine London has decided to introduce on 
arrivals from outside the country, effective from June 8, will impede that recovery. Willie Walsh, chief executive of 
IAG, told Sky News on June 5 that the industry had not been consulted on the latest quarantine plan and expected 
other carriers would also consider legal action. 
Saying that airlines face their "most difficult challenge," he argued that the UK plan had "torpedoed" any return to 
flying in July. "We think it is irrational, we think it is disproportionate, and we are giving consideration to a legal 
challenge to this legislation," he said. British Airways managed to operate just 485 passenger flights last month, 
Walsh continued, adding: "We did that by lunchtime on May 1 last year."Ryanair Holdings CEO Michael O'Leary 
has previously said the quarantine is "nonsense" and would be "useless." After Walsh's appearance on Sky News, 
the Irish budget carrier commented in a statement: "Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will support any legal action launched 
by IAG against this ineffective quarantine."

Jun 08, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Most people 
arriving in Britain from Monday will have to self-isolate for two weeks under a new coronavirus restriction that has 
been roundly condemned by the ailing aviation sector.The measure, which applies to both residents and visitors 
with some exceptions, aims to prevent a second wave of contagion from abroad.But critics question why Britain -- 
where the number of new COVID-19 infections per 100,000 people in the past fortnight was the second-highest in 
Europe -- is inflicting more pain on hotels and airlines by reducing travel from countries with fewer virus cases. 
EasyJet and two other carriers have launched joint legal proceedings against the UK government's quarantine plan 
for visitors Photo: AFP / John MACDOUGALL British Airways and budget carriers EasyJet and Ryanair have 
launched joint legal proceedings against the government over what they called a "disproportionate and unfair" 
step.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the new rules made sense because "the proportion of infections that 
come from abroad increases" as Britain's own caseload drops. "We've got to take an approach that starts with 
caution," he told Sky News.To enter Britain by plane, train, road or sea, travellers must provide details of their 
journey and the address where they will self-isolate. 
Britain's new quarantine measure applies to both residents and visitors with some exceptions Photo: AFP / Tolga 
Akmen  How the quarantine will be implemented differs between Britain's devolved nations, and the measures will 
be assessed every three weeks.Exemptions are being made in several cases -- including for lorry drivers, 
"essential" healthcare workers and people travelling from Ireland who have been there for at least two 
weeks.Authorities in England will carry out spot checks and those breaching the rules could be punished with a 
?1,000 ($1,250 / 1,125-euro) fine or prosecution. Britain's official death toll of 40,542 trails only that of the United 
States Photo: AFP / Tolga Akmen Home Secretary Priti Patel told sceptical lawmakers in parliament last week that 
the measure was "backed by the science, supported by the public, and essential to save lives".The government is 
pushing ahead with a gradual lockdown easing that will see retail reopen on June 15, and restaurants and bars 
begin limited service in early July.But the devastated hospitality sector relies heavily on tourists, and business 
leaders fear the quarantine will mean much of the summer season will be lost.It comes after heavily-hit Italy 
reopened its borders last week and other European states follow suit.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's 
government is trying to arrange "travel corridors" with countries such as France and Spain that could see them lift 
their quarantine demands.But officials are reportedly giving themselves until late June to strike these deals -- and 
the airlines behind the lawsuit say they cannot wait that long."These measures are disproportionate and unfair on 
British citizens as well as international visitors arriving in the UK," the airlines said in a joint statement.The

quarantine "will have a devastating effect on (the) UK's tourism industry and will destroy thousands of jobs in this 
unprecedented crisis", they said.Britain's official death toll of 40,542 trails only that of the United States.

Airlines threaten legal action as all arrivals to Britain must self-isolate for 14 days to curb the spread of coronavirus 
starting on Monday.
Michael O'Leary, group chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair, said "millions of jobs" could be lost as a result of 
the quarantine rule, which applies to arrivals, including British citizens, from all countries except Ireland.
Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the quarantine requirement, initially until June 28, was necessary 
so that "those arriving from abroad ... don't unknowingly spread the virus."
Britain has reported Europe's highest death toll linked to the coronavirus pandemic and its estimated infection rate 
remains higher than in most European nations.
"We have got the situation where - weeks ago - other countries put quarantine in and we didn't. Now, as 
everybody's lifting it, we're putting it in," opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer told London radio station LBC.
Ryanair, easyJet and British Airways owner IAG wrote to the government threatening legal action to stop the 
"disproportionate and unfair" measure, warning that it would have "a devastating effect on UK's tourism industry."
"We're seeing thousands of British families booking their holidays in Portugal, in Spain and Italy, but there's almost 
a collapse of inward bookings ... bringing those Europeans here to the UK, on which Britain's tourism industry 
depends," O'Leary told broadcaster ITV.
"What's irrational about it is all of those countries have a much lower Covid rate than the UK," he added.

Berlin Tegel airport will remain open until November as coronavirus travel restrictions are eased. The airport's 
operators earlier proposed suspending operations in mid-June. Flughafen Berlin-Brandenburg (FBB), the operator 
of Tegel, said on June 4 that the decision to keep the airport open was made as air traffic is increasing faster than 
expected and there are now clear signs of an approaching recovery. 
From mid-June, the number of regular connections from Berlin will increase to 40. In July, there will be 100 
connections offered. "It is likely that the number of daily passengers will more than double in June from the 
approximately 3,000 there are at the moment. Up to 20,000 passengers are expected at the end of July," FBB said 
in a statement. "A crucial reason for the significant increase in the number of connections is that travel restrictions 
will be lifted. On June 3, the German government announced that from mid-June it will lift the strict travel restrictions 
that have been in place until now to a great extent. This means that free travel to many European countries will be 
possible again from mid-June." Airlines that are gradually re-starting their flight operations include easyJet, which 
has its largest base outside the United Kingdom in Berlin. On June 2, the UK-headquartered LCC announced that 
operations would start again at the end of June. More flights are expected at the end of July. Ryanair plans to 
increase its flight operations from June 21 with a further increase in July. Other airlines have announced the revival 
of their services from Berlin, including Turkish Airlines, Wizz Air, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Air France, and Qatar 
Airways, Tegel's operators said. Lufthansa will expand its current service and, together with its subsidiaries 
Eurowings, Swiss, and Austrian Airlines will offer more flights from Berlin in July.

British travel firms called for an urgent "roadmap" for the resumption of tourism as the government imposed 
quarantine rules on all international arrivals from Monday.
Mark Tanzer, chief executive of travel trade association ABTA, said the quarantine plan to prevent the spread of the 
coronavirus would affect the British economy "beyond the wider transport and tourism industries."
"We must restart international travel as soon as it is safe to do so, and businesses and customers would benefit 
from the government outlining when this is likely to happen," Tanzer said.
"There are many livelihoods at stake, and bookings will only start to pick up in earnest when people and businesses 
have a better idea as to what the government's plan is to open up the UK and access to international destinations."
Three major British-based airlines earlier threatened legal action over the requirement for all arrivals to Britain to 
self-isolate for 14 days.
Ryanair, easyJet and British Airways owner IAG wrote to the government demanding the end of the 
"disproportionate and unfair" measure, warning that it would have "a devastating effect on UK's tourism industry."

Health Secretary Matt Hancock rejected the idea that the government had been forced into a "trade-off" between 
damage to the economy and the impact of the pandemic on health.
"If we don't have control of this virus then the economy will suffer yet more," Hancock told reporters.
"For those who aren't able to go abroad for a holiday, I know the impact that that will have this summer," he said.
"I just hope that we will be able to get to a position where people will be able to go on holiday - including 
domestically - safely, carefully and in a Covid-secure way."

Jun 08, 2020( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  Most 
people arriving in Britain from Monday will have to self-isolate for two weeks under a new coronavirus restriction 
that has been roundly condemned by the ailing aviation sector. The measure, which applies to both residents and 
visitors with some exceptions, aims to prevent a second wave of contagion from abroad. 
But critics question why Britain -- where the number of new COVID-19 infections per 100,000 people in the past 
fortnight was the second-highest in Europe -- is inflicting more pain on hotels and airlines by reducing travel from 
countries with fewer virus cases.British Airways and budget carriers EasyJet and Ryanair have launched joint legal 
proceedings against the government over what they called a "disproportionate and unfair" step. Health Secretary 
Matt Hancock said the new rules made sense because "the proportion of infections that come from abroad 
increases" as Britain's own caseload drops. "We've got to take an approach that starts with caution," he told Sky 
News. To enter Britain by plane, train, road or sea, travellers must provide details of their journey and the address 
where they will self-isolate. Britain's new quarantine measure applies to both residents and visitors with some 
exceptions AFP / Tolga Akmen How the quarantine will be implemented differs between Britain's devolved nations, 
and the measures will be assessed every three weeks. Exemptions are being made in several cases -- including for 
lorry drivers, "essential" healthcare workers and people travelling from Ireland who have been there for at least two 
weeks. Authorities in England will carry out spot checks and those breaching the rules could be punished with a 
?1,000 ($1,250 / 1,125-euro) fine or prosecution.  Britain's official death toll of 40,542 trails only that of the United 
States AFP / Tolga Akmen  Home Secretary Priti Patel told sceptical lawmakers in parliament last week that the 
measure was "backed by the science, supported by the public, and essential to save lives". The government is 
pushing ahead with a gradual lockdown easing that will see retail reopen on June 15, and restaurants and bars 
begin limited service in early July. But the devastated hospitality sector relies heavily on tourists, and business 
leaders fear the quarantine will mean much of the summer season will be lost. It comes after heavily-hit Italy 
reopened its borders last week and other European states follow suit. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's 
government is trying to arrange "travel corridors" with countries such as France and Spain that could see them lift 
their quarantine demands. But officials are reportedly giving themselves until late June to strike these deals -- and 
the airlines behind the lawsuit say they cannot wait that long. "These measures are disproportionate and unfair on 
British citizens as well as international visitors arriving in the UK," the airlines said in a joint statement. The 
quarantine "will have a devastating effect on (the) UK's tourism industry and will destroy thousands of jobs in this 
unprecedented crisis", they said. Britain's official death toll of 40,542 trails only that of the United States.

Travellers arriving in Britain will from today have to self-isolate for 14 days under a quarantine regime described as 
"useless" by airlines, although there are signs Boris Johnson wants to swiftly ease restrictions.
Priti Patel, home secretary, said "we all want to return to normal as quickly as possible" but claimed the quarantine, 
backed up by fines of £1,000, was justified by the science.
But Mr Johnson, facing widespread Conservative unease and the threat of legal action by airlines, is looking to 
negotiate quarantine-free "air bridges" with other European countries.
Turkey, Spain, Greece and Portugal are among the popular holiday destinations that have indicated a willingness to 
strike such a deal, even though the UK continues to have relatively high Covid-19 infection rates.
Rishi Sunak, chancellor, Alok Sharma, business secretary, and Grant Shapps, transport secretary, are pushing for 
an early end to the quarantine, which they say is hitting the British economy and aviation sector.
Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said last week that a quarantine was most effective 
where Britain had few cases of coronavirus and other countries had higher rates of infection; neither criteria has 
been met.
But Ms Patel said: "The science is clear that if we limit the risk of new cases being brought in from abroad, we can 
help stop a devastating second wave."
Quarantine begins despite legal threat from airlines International travel
Travellers arriving in Britain from today must complete a "passenger locator form" to supply contact details, travel 
details and the address where they intend to self-isolate. The Home Office said passengers "could be contacted 
regularly" to ensure compliance. Meanwhile, easyJet and Ryanair have joined British Airways in taking legal action 
against the government's planned two-week quarantine period.
In a joint letter signed on Friday, the carriers said the move was "disproportionate" and unfair to foreign nationals 
and UK citizens, and would destroy attempts to rebuild their businesses.

Last Friday was World Environment Day. Congratulations if you noticed. Even in an ordinary year, this 
UNdesignated day can be overshadowed by events.
In this year of pandemic and protest it had little hope, which prompts a wider question: are the mushrooming efforts 
to stave off the great environmental threat of climate change about to be derailed? When the coronavirus crisis first 
took hold, I was sure this would happen. The only figures that mattered were the ones that dropped into my inbox 
each day showing the latest Covid-19 death toll and how each country was faring in the fight against the virus.
They were closely followed by data charting the crushing number of job losses and economic collapse.
These are still vital signs to monitor.
But as the months have passed, another set of data has begun to pile up that will in time form an important ranking. 
It will show which countries - and companies - are using this crisis to deepen the drive against fossil fuels and which 
are not.
With at least $10tn in stimulus measures announced so far, a few entries on the green side of the ledger already 
stand out. Predictably a lot are in Europe, home to Greta Thunberg and flight-shaming.
This recovery will be greener than the last one
Electric cars should be cheaper and easier to charge under France's (EURO)8bn auto sector recovery plan. Air 
France is set to slash domestic flights and cut its overall emissions as a condition of its (EURO)7bn bailout. The EU 
says green policies will be central to its (EURO)750bn recovery plan.
But Europe is not alone. Canada's bailout money for big employers will only go to firms reporting climate risks to 
their business, using disclosure standards that have been largely voluntary until now. If this paves the way for those 
standards to become widespread and mandatory, it could help shift billions of investor dollars to greener ventures 
and firms.
Against this, the Trump administration is easing environmental safeguards and the picture is mixed in China and 
many other countries.
So will the world end up looking more like the US or Europe? At least one prominent chief executive thinks even 
Europe will be forced suspend climate action.
"I suspect an awful lot of the environmental agenda and targets will be put on the backburner for a number of 
years," says Ryanair's Michael O'Leary. People will still care about the environment, the airline boss told a recent 
FT conference. But they will care much more about "massive unemployment" and government indebtedness.
Mr O'Leary has history on his side. Ahead of the last global recession just over a decade ago, he predicted the 
downturn would shift attention from the environment to unemployment.
In the event, only $1 in $6 was spent on sustainable infrastructure, says former Bank of England governor, Mark 
Carney, now an adviser on the next round of UN climate talks.
Those talks themselves add weight to Mr O'Leary's view. They were due in Glasgow in November, making 2020 a 
year when countries stepped up pressure on each other to cut emissions. The pandemic forced a delay until 
November 2021.
For what it's worth though, I think Mr O'Leary will be wrong about this crisis. Too much has changed since the last 
one. Green technology costs have fallen. Green job numbers have grown. Renewable energy companies alone 
employed 11m people globally at the end of 2018, up from about 3.5m in 2010.
Countries have agreed to compensate coal workers and other losers in the green energy shift. All this makes it 
much harder to argue climate action automatically costs jobs.
And it shows why those who did notice World Environment Day last week saw something else that has shifted since 
the last crisis.
Hundreds of companies today either back the net zero emissions targets that have multiplied since 2018, or say 
governments should align recovery plans with those goals. That includes Rolls-Royce, BP, HSBC and Heathrow 
airport. Ryanair is not there yet and Mr O'Leary may speak for a silent majority. But the direction of travel is clear 
and it means this recovery will be shaped in a very different way to the last one.

With at least $10tn in stimulus measures announced so far, a few entries on the green side of the ledger already 
stand out. Predictably a lot are in Europe, home to Greta Thunberg and flight-shaming.
This recovery will be greener than the last one
Electric cars should be cheaper and easier to charge under France's (EURO)8bn auto sector recovery plan. Air 
France is set to slash domestic flights and cut its overall emissions as a condition of its (EURO)7bn bailout. The EU 
says green policies will be central to its (EURO)750bn recovery plan.
But Europe is not alone. Canada's bailout money for big employers will only go to firms reporting climate risks to 
their business, using disclosure standards that have been largely voluntary until now. If this paves the way for those 
standards to become widespread and mandatory, it could help shift billions of investor dollars to greener ventures 
and firms.
Against this, the Trump administration is easing environmental safeguards and the picture is mixed in China and 
many other countries.
So will the world end up looking more like the US or Europe? At least one prominent chief executive thinks even 
Europe will be forced suspend climate action.
"I suspect an awful lot of the environmental agenda and targets will be put on the backburner for a number of 
years," says Ryanair's Michael O'Leary. People will still care about the environment, the airline boss told a recent 
FT conference. But they will care much more about "massive unemployment" and government indebtedness.
Mr O'Leary has history on his side. Ahead of the last global recession just over a decade ago, he predicted the 
downturn would shift attention from the environment to unemployment.
In the event, only $1 in $6 was spent on sustainable infrastructure, says former Bank of England governor, Mark 
Carney, now an adviser on the next round of UN climate talks.
Those talks themselves add weight to Mr O'Leary's view. They were due in Glasgow in November, making 2020 a 
year when countries stepped up pressure on each other to cut emissions. The pandemic forced a delay until 
November 2021.
For what it's worth though, I think Mr O'Leary will be wrong about this crisis. Too much has changed since the last 
one. Green technology costs have fallen. Green job numbers have grown. Renewable energy companies alone 
employed 11m people globally at the end of 2018, up from about 3.5m in 2010.
Countries have agreed to compensate coal workers and other losers in the green energy shift. All this makes it 
much harder to argue climate action automatically costs jobs.
And it shows why those who did notice World Environment Day last week saw something else that has shifted since 
the last crisis.
Hundreds of companies today either back the net zero emissions targets that have multiplied since 2018, or say 
governments should align recovery plans with those goals. That includes Rolls-Royce, BP, HSBC and Heathrow 
airport. Ryanair is not there yet and Mr O'Leary may speak for a silent majority. But the direction of travel is clear 
and it means this recovery will be shaped in a very different way to the last one.

Last Friday was World Environment Day. Congratulations if you noticed. Even in an ordinary year, this 
UNdesignated day can be overshadowed by events.
In this year of pandemic and protest it had little hope, which prompts a wider question: are the mushrooming efforts 
to stave off the great environmental threat of climate change about to be derailed? When the coronavirus crisis first 
took hold, I was sure this would happen. The only figures that mattered were the ones that dropped into my inbox 
each day showing the latest Covid-19 death toll and how each country was faring in the fight against the virus.
They were closely followed by data charting the crushing number of job losses and economic collapse.
These are still vital signs to monitor.
But as the months have passed, another set of data has begun to pile up that will in time form an important ranking. 
It will show which countries - and companies - are using this crisis to deepen the drive against fossil fuels and which 
are not.
With at least $10tn in stimulus measures announced so far, a few entries on the green side of the ledger already 
stand out. Predictably a lot are in Europe, home to Greta Thunberg and flight-shaming.

 British Airways' owner started legal proceedings against the UK government over its 14-day quarantine rule as the 
country reported its lowest daily COVID-19 death toll since the lockdown began in March at 77.
In a letter sent by International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG.L), Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) and EasyJet (EZJ.L) 
to ministers on Friday, the airlines said the measures are "disproportionate and unfair" on British nationals and 
international travelers arriving in the UK.
"We urge the UK government to remove this ineffective visitor quarantine which will have a devastating effect on 
UK's tourism industry and will destroy (even more) thousands of jobs in this unprecedented crisis," the airlines said.
Starting Monday, travelers arriving in the UK will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. Those who breach self-
isolation may face a 1,000 pound sterling ($1,271) penalty or potential prosecution.
As of Sunday, 286,194 people in the UK tested positive for COVID-19, with 40,542 deaths.
IAG shares jumped 14% on Friday's close, while EasyJet rose 7%.

 EasyJet (EZJ.L) Chief Executive Johan Lundgren warned that there would be more job losses if the UK 
government's 14-day quarantine rule lasts longer than expected, Sky News reported Monday.
Lundgren told Sky's Ian King Live that the aviation sector "will not be intact" if there is no change to the quarantine 
rule.
The government starting Monday requires travelers arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days, with a 1,000 pound 
sterling ($1,271) penalty for those who breach the rule. British Airways' owner International Consolidated Airlines 
Group (IAG.L), backed by EasyJet and Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L), sued the government as a result.
EasyJet already plans to reduce its workforce by up to 30%, or about 4,500 jobs, and shrink its fleet size due to 
lower demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Budget airline Ryanair will not carry out its plan to shutter its loss-making subsidiary Lauda in Vienna, the Austrian 
carrier announced on Monday after employees agreed to a last-minute wage deal.
The management of Ireland-based Ryanair had set several deadlines for Lauda staff to agree to wage cuts and 
threatened to cut all 500 job at the Lauda base in Vienna as the subsidiary would be moved to a new hub.
However, unionists blocked Ryanair's proposal, arguing that the new entry-level wages were below the poverty line.
After union representatives and Austria's chamber of commerce agreed on a new wage cut deal last week, Lauda 
staff approved it in a poll on the weekend.
However, some jobs will be cut, and the number of Lauda's Airbus aircraft in Vienna will be reduced from 16 to 10, 
the Austrian low-cost carrier said in a statement.
"We will need these cost efficiencies if we are to successfully compete against the state subsidised Lufthansa 
subsidiary," Lauda chief executives Andreas Gruber and David O'Brien said, in a stab against the government 
bailout of Austrian Airlines.
The Lauda fleet that was grounded because of the coronavirus pandemic will gradually start flying again on July 1.

arrive on the first day of new rules that people arriving in Britain from overseas will have to quarantine themselves

British government has said that anyone caught not complying with the quarantine will face a fine. (AP Photo/Matt

country — a sweeping measure meant to halt the further spread of COVID-19 that has been roundly criticized by 
the aviation and tourism industries. All passengers — bar a handful of exceptions like truckers or medical workers 
— will be asked to fill in a form detailing exactly where they will self-isolate for two weeks and give a phone number 
so authorities can check up on them. The requirement applies regardless if they are citizens or not. 
In England, new arrivals should stay indoors and rely on others to get their food. They can only leave for specific 
reasons like needing urgent medical care or medicine. Those who fail to comply with the quarantine rules could be 
fined. 'There are quite a lot of unknowns about the situation,'' Crime, Policing and Justice Minister Kit Malthouse 
told the BBC. 'But for the moment, having a clear set of rules around international travel is critical.'  The quarantine 
was imposed after a heated debate on whether it would help British efforts to tamp down the U.K. outbreak or 
simply stamp out any hopes that the British tourism industry will recover following months of closures under the 
country's coronavirus lockdown measures. Many questioned the quarantine's timing, saying it has been introduced 
too late to be useful and too early to tamp down on any expected second wave of infections. Venki Ramakrishnan, 
president of the prestigious Royal Society, told the BBC that the coronavirus transmission rate in the U.K. is still too 
high for the quarantine to work well. 'I would say that countries that have imposed quarantine did so either very 
early or after the case rate in the country had gone down quite a bit,' he said. Ryanair chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said the quarantine was a 'political stunt' and argued that it will cause 'untold devastation' for the country's 
tourism industry, not just on the airlines. (Ad) With each passing day, the market seems to become more volatile

Jun 08, 2020( Medical Xpress: http://medicalxpress.com Delivered by Newstex)  Credit: CC0 Public Domain Most 
people arriving in Britain from Monday will have to self-isolate for two weeks under a new coronavirus restriction 
that has been roundly condemned by the ailing aviation sector. The measure, which applies to both residents and 
visitors with some exceptions, aims to prevent a second wave of contagion from abroad. But critics question why 
Britain—where the number of new COVID-19 infections per 100,000 people in the past fortnight was the second-
highest in Europe—is inflicting more pain on hotels and airlines by reducing travel from countries with fewer virus 
cases. 
British Airways and budget carriers EasyJet and Ryanair have launched joint legal proceedings against the 
government over what they called a "disproportionate and unfair" step. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the new 
rules made sense because "the proportion of infections that come from abroad increases" as Britain's own caseload 
drops. "We've got to take an approach that starts with caution," he told Sky News. To enter Britain by plane, train, 
road or sea, travellers must provide details of their journey and the address where they will self-isolate. How the 
quarantine will be implemented differs between Britain's devolved nations, and the measures will be assessed 
every three weeks. Exemptions are being made in several cases—including for lorry drivers, "essential" healthcare 
workers and people travelling from Ireland who have been there for at least two weeks. Authorities in England will 
carry out spot checks and those breaching the rules could be punished with a 1,000 ($1,250 / 1,125-euro) fine or 
prosecution.  Travel corridor hopes Home Secretary Priti Patel told sceptical lawmakers in parliament last week that 
the measure was "backed by the science, supported by the public, and essential to save lives". The government is 
pushing ahead with a gradual lockdown easing that will see retail reopen on June 15, and restaurants and bars 
begin limited service in early July. But the devastated hospitality sector relies heavily on tourists, and business 
leaders fear the quarantine will mean much of the summer season will be lost. It comes after heavily-hit Italy 
reopened its borders last week and other European states follow suit. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's 
government is trying to arrange "travel corridors" with countries such as France and Spain that could see them lift 
their quarantine demands. But officials are reportedly giving themselves until late June to strike these deals—and 
the airlines behind the lawsuit say they cannot wait that long. "These measures are disproportionate and unfair on 
British citizens as well as international visitors arriving in the UK," the airlines said in a joint statement. The 
quarantine "will have a devastating effect on (the) UK's tourism industry and will destroy thousands of jobs in this 
unprecedented crisis", they said. Britain's official death toll of 40,542 trails only that of the United States. Explore

Airlines Holdings UAL[2] is closing three out of its four international bases for flight attendants in the face of low

Hong Kong and Tokyo with effect from Oct 1, while maintaining operations at its London base, per its head of in-
flight services John Slater.The closures will impact around 840 flight attendants, who would need to be transferred

Jun 08, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  A passenger wearing a face shield 
and face mask arrives on the first day of new rules that people arriving in Britain from overseas will have to 
quarantine themselves for 14 days to help stop the spread of coronavirus, at Heathrow Airport in London, Monday, 
June 8, 2020. The British government has said that anyone caught not complying with the quarantine will face a 
fine. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham)LONDON (AP) — Britain began imposing a 14-day quarantine Monday on travelers 
coming into the country, months after other European countries imposed similar measures to control the spread of 
the coronavirus. The quarantine was roundly criticized by the aviation and tourism industries, with many questioning 
its timing. Critics say its introduction has come too late to be useful, and some doubted it could be effectively 
enforced. 
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary called the quarantine a 'political stunt' and argued that it will cause 'untold 
devastation' for the country's tourism industry, not just for the airlines. 'The thousands of hotels, the thousands of 
visitor attractions, restaurants in the next couple of months — July and August are the two key months for British 
tourism,'' he added. 'We're facing thousands of jobs losses because of a stupid, ineffective quarantine.'  All 
passengers — bar a handful of exceptions like truckers or medical workers — will be asked to fill in a form detailing 
where they will self-isolate for two weeks and must give a phone number so authorities can check up on them. The 
requirement applies regardless whether they are U.K. citizens or not, and those who fail to comply could be fined. 
The quarantine was imposed after a heated debate on whether it would help British efforts to tamp down the U.K. 
outbreak or simply stamp out any hopes that the British tourism industry will recover following months of lockdown. 
Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the prestigious Royal Society, told the BBC the coronavirus transmission rate in 
the U.K. is still too high for the quarantine to work well. 'I would say that countries that have imposed quarantine did 
so either very early or after the case rate in the country had gone down quite a bit,' he said. British Airways, EasyJet 
and Ryanair have written to the British government applying for a judicial review, arguing that the quarantine rules 
are disproportionate. Willie Walsh, the boss of IAG — the group that owns British Airways — has said that airlines 
were not consulted about the move. (Ad) Trump's 5G plan is opening the flood gates to 3 million new jobs, $12.3 
trillion in economic growth, and a brand new 5G device. One of the world's top angel investors - a tech genius 
named Jeff Brown believes the company behind this device is the Number One Tech Stock of 202, and it will go 
from $0 to nearly $100 billion in sales - this year. Many other European countries are beginning to reopen their 
borders as their infection numbers come down.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government has been 
widely criticized for its slow response to fighting the outbreak. Many in his government, including Johnson himself, 
came down with coronavirus. Britain did not close its borders, screen international arrivals or impose testing and 
Aviation, tourism groups protest UK's 14-day quarantine
tracing measures for travelers during the worst of the coronavirus outbreak. The government had insisted until May 
that putting restrictions at the border wouldn't have a significant impact on the spread of the virus in the U.K.  
Figures on Monday showed that a further 55 people died after testing positive with the virus, the lowest daily rise in 
the number of coronavirus deaths in the country since late March. Britain's total death toll stood at 40,597, the 
second-highest in the world after the United States. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that while the pandemic is 
'clearly not over,' all the data showed that the country is making good progress. 'Coronavirus is in retreat across the 
land. Our plan is working,' he said. At London's Stansted Airport on Monday, shopkeeper Netti Rexhmet, who 
arrived from the Netherlands, said the rule will prevent him from working for two weeks. 'We haven't got any other 
options, it's government law so I shall do it,' he said, but added: 'For me, I wouldn't want to do it. ... I've got things to 
do." In other developments in Europe: MOLDOVA SEES COVID-19 CASES SURGE: A former health minister says 
Moldova's coronavirus pandemic is 'out of control' as the number of new cases keeps rising. Statistics released 
Monday show that Moldova registered 1,149 new COVID-19 cases in the first week of June, the highest weekly 
figure since March 7, when the first case was registered. Former Health Minister Ala Nemerenco said on Facebook 
that 'you don't have to be an epidemiologist, a virologist, or even a doctor to understand that the situation has 
gotten out of control.' Moldova has registered 9,700 coronavirus cases and 346 deaths. POLAND SHUTS 12 
MINES AMID OUTBREAK: Polish authorities have ordered the closure of 12 coal mines for three weeks after 
hundreds of workers were infected with COVID-19. The measure announced Monday comes as coal mines in 
Poland's southern mining region of Silesia have become virus hot spots. Deputy Prime Minister Jacek Sasin says 
miners will receive full pay during the closure. Some 5,000 of Poland's 27,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases are coal 
miners. MOSCOW ENDS TWO-MONTH LOCKDOWN: The Russian capital is ending a tight lockdown that has 
been in place for more than two months, citing a slowdown in the coronavirus outbreak. Moscow Mayor Sergei 
Sobyanin said starting Tuesday residents will no longer be required to obtain electronic passes for travel and can 
walk, use public transport and drive without restrictions. The number of daily infections in Moscow has dropped 
from a peak of 6,700 to about 2,000 recently. Meanwhile, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Monday 
that traveling abroad for work, studying, receiving medical treatment or taking care of relatives will be allowed. It 
wasn't immediately clear when the partial reopening of Russia's borders would take effect.  CYPRUS POLICE 
MOVES AGAINST SCOFFLAW BAR: Cypriot officials are warning against undue complacency in enforcing social 
distancing rules after video emerged of an jam-packed open-air nightclub at a popular seaside resort. Cyprus police 
spokesman Christos Andreou told The Associated Press on Monday that the Ayia Napa nightclub's owner faces a 
charge of flouting maximum capacity limits. Andreou said police are taking the owner to court because he was 
repeatedly warned over the weekend and will also seek a court order to temporarily shut down the club. ___ Follow

World[1]The unintended consequences of the coronavirus pandemic are being played out in homes and apartments 
throughout the world. More and more employees are working from home, that's if they have a job to go to. Entire 
industries are effectively shut down as the world attempts to slow the spread of the virus. At some point, however, 
things will return to normal. But it will be a new normal. There are many businesses that won't reopen, and many 
industries that will forever be changed. As an investor, now is the time to get out your crystal ball. Timing the market 
is a fool's errand. But looking at what industries are positioned to thrive in a world that will be changed by the 
coronavirus is a prudent strategy. We've identified 8 companies that are adapting to what the economy will be like 
in a post-coronavirus world. It will undoubtedly be more digital than it already is. Supply chains may become more 
vertically integrated as 'Made in America' may take on a whole new meaning. As will the idea of working from home, 
going to a concert, or even preparing a meal. View the "Top 8 Companies That Are Adapting to a Post-Coronavirus

Jun 08, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair[1]'s boss Micheal O'Leary 
said the airline will not cancel flights to and from the United Kingdom despite the government introducing a 14 day 
quarantine for international travellers. Earlier, the government said that, from June 8, all international arrivals, 
including returning Britons, will have to self-isolate and provide details[2] of where they will be staying. Asked 
whether Ryanair would cancel July and August flights if the quarantine remained in place during those months, 
O'Leary said: 'No, because the flights are full outbound of the UK. British people are ignoring this quarantine, they 
know it's rubbish'. The rules do not apply to Ireland, which has a free-movement agreement with the UK. Freight 
drivers, medical professionals and seasonal agricultural workers are also excluded. Those breaking the rules would 
face a $1,220 fine or prosecution, the government warned. Ryanair, EasyJet and IAG have launched a legal protest 
against the quarantine. [ 1]:

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ba-joins-ryanair-and-easyjet-launch-legal-action-against-uk-governments-
quarantine-rules/Britain's three biggest airlines have started legal proceedings against the government in a bid to 
overturn quarantine rules due to take effect in the UK from Monday.BA's owner, IAG, along with Ryanair and 
EasyJet, have sent a pre-action protocol letter setting out why they believes the moves, which will force air 
passengers arriving from abroad to self-isolate for 14 days, are illogical and unfair. Airlines and travel firms have 
protested in vain against the new Home Office-led regulations, which they have said come months late to stop the 
transmission of coronavirus and will kill off any nascent recovery in their industries. 
The airlines' letter argues that the quarantine measures are more severe than those applied where the risks are 
greater, and impose greater restrictions on arrivals than on people infected with Covid-19. The airlines also object 
that enforcement of the regulations as published appears to apply only to England, and people arriving in Scotland, 
Wales or Northern Ireland would not face the same penalties. The devolved administrations have yet to set out how 
they will police the rules. The letter, the first step in an application for judicial review, was sent on Friday. A Ryanair 
spokesperson, commenting on behalf of the three airlines, said: 'These measures are disproportionate and unfair 
on British citizens as well as international visitors arriving in the UK. We urge the government to remove this 
ineffective visitor quarantine which will have a devastating effect on UK's tourism industry and will destroy even 
more thousands of jobs in this unprecedented crisis.' The government has argued that the quarantine rules are 
science-based and would help limit the risk of a second wave as restrictions on movement are eased. The home 
secretary, Priti Patel, said: 'We all want to return to normal as quickly as possible. But this cannot be at the expense 
of lives. The science is clear that if we limit the risk of new cases being brought in from abroad, we can help stop a 
devastating second wave. 'That is why the measures coming into force today are necessary. They will help control 
the virus, protect the NHS and save lives.' Posters spelling out the new requirements for travellers will be displayed 
at all UK ports and airports. Airlines will be expected to notify passengers of the rules, but not to enforce them. The 
director general of Border Force, Paul Lincoln, said officials were 'prepared and ready for the new measures which 
are being enacted at the UK border today'. The quarantine row comes amid further uproar over BA's plans to sack 
about 12,000 staff and lower the terms and conditions of remaining employees. The pilots union Balpa told 
members on Saturday the airline had increased the number of pilot redundancies it was seeking by another 125 to 
BA joins Ryanair and EasyJet launch legal action against UK government's quarantine rules
almost 1,300, more than a quarter of the workforce. It warned that BA had said it would 'force changes by 
terminating the employment of all pilots and offering individuals new contracts with associated new terms and 
conditions' if they could not find agreement. The airline appears to have made concessions on a possible voluntary 
redundancy scheme, which it initially ruled out, saying it would pay only the statutory minimum to longserving staff. 
BA may also start furloughing senior pilots from the grounded A380 and 747 fleets, who had agreed to effectively 
halve their pay by taking unpaid leave at the start of the crisis to allow for a possible quick return to flying. The flag 
carrier's actions have been condemned by ministers and unions. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, 
which represents cabin crew, said: 'BA and its owners IAG can afford to see out this crisis without such drastic cuts. 
This is a company with a lot of cash, strong assets and sustainable debt. The company controls some of the most 
profitable routes in the world and is backed by the Qatar royal family,' a 25% shareholder in IAG. He pointed out 
that IAG was about to spend almost €1bn (870m) on acquiring Air Europa, adding: 'Workers in Britain are being 
sacrificed for the benefit of shareholders.' Read more: BA joins Ryanair and EasyJet launch legal action against UK

— Travelers to Britain are now being required to go into quarantine for two weeks — a sweeping measure meant to 
halt the further spread of COVID-19. Starting Monday, all passengers will be asked to fill in a form detailing where 
they will self-isolate, with only a few exceptions. Those who fail to comply with the quarantine rules could be fined. 
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary says the quarantine will cause 'untold devastation' for the country's tourism 
industry — not just on the airlines. 
He told the BBC that hotels, visitor attractions and restaurants will also be hurt, and thousands of jobs will be lost.

allowed to reopen from Monday in Greece, where an early lockdown is credited with keeping the number of 
coronavirus deaths and serious illnesses at low levels. Nearly all lockdown measures have now been lifted in a 
phased reopening, with regulations in place for businesses to maintain limits on the number of customers allowed 
and distances to be maintained. Most bars, nightclubs and restaurants operate outdoors in Greece during the 
summer months, which has helped authorities in allowing their reopening. However, government and health 
authorities warn local lockdowns could be imposed if violations in social distancing regulations lead to outbreaks.  
___ NEW DELHI — India is reopening its restaurants, shopping malls and religious places in most states even as 
the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the country grows. The Health Ministry reported another 9,983

cases Monday, raising India's count past 256,000 to fifth most in the world. The 206 fatalities reported Monday were 
the highest single-day rise and takes the country's death toll to 7,135. New Delhi is also reopening its state borders, 
allowing interstate movement of people and goods. India already partially restored train services and domestic 
flights and allowed shops and manufacturing to reopen. Schools remain closed. The number of new cases has 
soared since the government began relaxing restrictions. There has also been a surge in infections in India's vast 
countryside following the return of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers who left cities and towns after losing 
their jobs. —— ISLAMABAD — The number of new coronavirus infections in Pakistan continued to spiral upward, 
as thenation of 220 million people surpassed 100,000 cases as of Sunday with more than 2,000 deaths. The daily 
infection rate spiked after the Islamic holy month of Ramadan ended and markets were thrown open during the Eid-
al Fitr holiday at the end of May. That followed the government refusing to close mosques and deciding to open up 
the country even as medical professionals pleaded for a stricter lockdown, Since then the daily infection rates have 
held fairly steady with just under 5,000 new cases each day. Testing has held steady in recent days at about 22,000 
each day, with government officials saying Pakistan aimed to eventually carry out 30,000 tests every day. Prime 
Minister Imran Khan has gone on national television to tell Pakistanis the country's poorest cannot survive a strict 
lockdown. The International Monetary fund and the Asian Development Bank have both give Pakistan millions of 
dollars in bridge loans to ease the economic impact of the pandemic pummeling economies worldwide. ___ 
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Data from the New Mexico Health Department shows COVID-19 infections among health 
care workers in the state have spiked as intensive care units remain full and nurses and first responders call for 
more protective equipment. The data shows 492 workers were diagnosed in May, marking a 219% increase from 
the 154 workers who had tested positive for the coronavirus the month before. Human Services Secretary David 
Scrase told the Albuquerque Journal that the increase was expected. The largest increase came in Bernalillo 
County — home to three of the state's COVID-19 hub hospitals. San Juan and McKinley counties also had surges. 
___ JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia's capital of Jakarta, the city hardest hit by the new coronavirus, has partly 
reopened after two months of partial lockdown as the world's fourth most populous nation braces to gradually 
reopen its economy. The city of 11 million people, with a total of 30 million in its greater metropolitan area, has been 
under large-scale social restrictions since April 10. Jakarta Gov. Anies Baswedan announced that all worship 
facilities will be allowed to reopen with half their capacity and social distancing measures on Friday, followed by 
offices, restaurants and grocery stores that begin to resume activities with only 50% of their employees and clients 
on Monday. The measure also applies to public transportation. Schools are closed during this month's transition 
phase to the so-called 'new normal,' while some shopping centres, zoo and beaches will open their doors next 
week. But the major transport and industrial hub has now signalled the end of its isolation, with social media 
showing long lines of travelers queued at train stations, many ignoring social distancing rules. Jakarta, the first large 
city to enforce a partial lockdown in the country, has recorded more than 8,033 confirmed cases with 529 deaths. 
Nationwide, there's been 31,186 infections and 1,851 fatalities. ___ WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand 
has eradicated the coronavirus from its shores after health officials reported that the final person known to have 
contracted an infection had recovered. It has been 17 days since the last new case was reported in New Zealand, 
and Monday also marked the first time since late February that there have been no active cases. Health officials 
caution that new cases could be imported into the country, which has closed its borders to everybody but citizens 
and residents, with some exceptions. Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said it was a pleasing 
development. 'Having no active cases for the first time since February 28 is certainly a significant mark in our 
journey but as we've previously said, ongoing vigilance against COVID-19 will continue to be essential,' Bloomfield 
said. Experts say a number of factors have helped the nation of 5 million wipe out the disease, including its isolated 
location, along with leadership shown by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who imposed a strict lockdown early on 
during the outbreak. Just over 1,500 people contracted the virus in New Zealand, including 22 who died. ___ 
SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea has reported 38 new cases of COVID-19 as infections continue to rise in the 
densely populated capital area. The figures by South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 
Monday brought national totals to 11,814 cases and 273 deaths. All but four of the new cases came from the Seoul 
metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea's 51 million people live, as officials scramble to stem 
transmissions linked to e-commerce workers, door-to-door sellers and people who went out amid loosened social 
distancing. Health Minister Park Neunghoo, during a virus meeting, called for officials to examine the supplies of 
test equipment in case infections continue to increase. He also called for education officials to double-check 
preventive measures with millions of children returning to school. Classes on Monday were reopened for around 1.3

to Buy After the Market's Historic Sell-Off[1]Technology stocks are among the most volatile in the market. The allure 
of big gains comes with the risk of sharp downturns. When the market is trending upwards, these stocks have a 
tendency to lead the way. Conversely, when the market is selling off, tech stocks post some of the largest losses. 
And in the coronavirus crash tech stocks took their usual beating. But an interesting dynamic is happening. As 
stocks are trying to stage a comeback, many tech stocks are being left behind. Many of the leading tech stocks 
trade on the NASDAQ exchange. However, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&#38;P 500 posted 
gains on March 25, the NASDAQ stayed down. And that's an opportunity for investors who know where to look. 
We've put together this presentation to give you ten technology stocks that look to be solid bets no matter which 
way the market moves. Some of the stocks you'll see are companies that have a business model that is perfectly 
suited for today's social distancing environment. View the "10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy After the Market's Historic

Jun 08, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  MOSCOW — Russia says it will 
partially reopen the country's borders as the country eases coronavirus restrictions.  Prime Minister Mikhail 
Mishustin said Monday that traveling abroad for the purposes of work, studying, receiving medical treatment or 
taking care of relatives will be allowed. He said Russia will let in foreigners seeking medical treatment or taking care 
of family members. It wasn't immediately clear when the partial reopening of the borders would go into effect. 
 Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters there is 'no set date' yet for resuming international flights, which 
were halted in late March. Last month, President Vladimir Putin called for gradual lifting of lockdown restrictions, 
saying that Russia was able to slow down the epidemic.  The country's health officials, however, have been 
reporting around 9,000 new infections daily since mid May and some experts are concerned that easing lockdown 
restrictions may be premature ___  HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TODAY ABOUT THE VIRUS 
OUTBREAK: — Worldwide virus deaths pass 400,000, according to Johns Hopkins tally. — New Zealand says it 
has eradicated the virus. — India eases lockdown even as virus cases jump in capital. — Coronavirus disrupts 
global fight to save endangered species. — Britain faces criticism for another sudden change in its advice on face 
masks: all hospital staff in England will wear surgical face masks beginning June 15 while visitors will need some 
sort of face covering.  — While seasonal colds and the flu spread through NFL locker rooms most years, many 
players polled by The Associated Press say they're scared to return to work without a vaccine for the coronavirus.

Millionaire trader, Jeff Clark Go to https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak for updates throughout the day. ___ HERE'S 
WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING TODAY: ___ LONDON — Travelers to Britain are now being required to go into 
quarantine for two weeks — a sweeping measure meant to halt the further spread of COVID-19. Starting Monday, 
all passengers will be asked to fill in a form detailing where they will self-isolate, with only a few exceptions. Those 
who fail to comply with the quarantine rules could be fined. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary says the 
quarantine will cause 'untold devastation' for the country's tourism industry — not just on the airlines. He told the 
BBC that hotels, visitor attractions and restaurants will also be hurt, and thousands of jobs will be lost. ___ 
ATHENS, Greece — Bars, nightclubs and internet cafes are allowed to reopen from Monday in Greece, where an 
early lockdown is credited with keeping the number of coronavirus deaths and serious illnesses at low levels. Nearly 
all lockdown measures have now been lifted in a phased reopening, with regulations in place for businesses to 
maintain limits on the number of customers allowed and distances to be maintained. Most bars, nightclubs and 
restaurants operate outdoors in Greece during the summer months, which has helped authorities in allowing their

reopening. However, government and health authorities warn local lockdowns could be imposed if violations in 
social distancing regulations lead to outbreaks.  ___ NEW DELHI — India is reopening its restaurants, shopping 
malls and religious places in most states even as the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the country grows. 
The Health Ministry reported another 9,983 cases Monday, raising India's count past 256,000 to fifth most in the 
world. The 206 fatalities reported Monday were the highest single-day rise and takes the country's death toll to 
7,135. New Delhi is also reopening its state borders, allowing interstate movement of people and goods. India 
already partially restored train services and domestic flights and allowed shops and manufacturing to reopen. 
Schools remain closed. The number of new cases has soared since the government began relaxing restrictions. 
There has also been a surge in infections in India's vast countryside following the return of hundreds of thousands 
of migrant workers who left cities and towns after losing their jobs. —— ISLAMABAD — The number of new 
coronavirus infections in Pakistan continued to spiral upward, as thenation of 220 million people surpassed 100,000 
cases as of Sunday with more than 2,000 deaths. The daily infection rate spiked after the Islamic holy month of 
Ramadan ended and markets were thrown open during the Eid-al Fitr holiday at the end of May. That followed the 
government refusing to close mosques and deciding to open up the country even as medical professionals pleaded 
for a stricter lockdown, Since then the daily infection rates have held fairly steady with just under 5,000 new cases 
each day. Testing has held steady in recent days at about 22,000 each day, with government officials saying 
Pakistan aimed to eventually carry out 30,000 tests every day. Prime Minister Imran Khan has gone on national 
television to tell Pakistanis the country's poorest cannot survive a strict lockdown. The International Monetary fund 
and the Asian Development Bank have both give Pakistan millions of dollars in bridge loans to ease the economic 
impact of the pandemic pummeling economies worldwide. ___ ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Data from the New 
Mexico Health Department shows COVID-19 infections among health care workers in the state have spiked as 
intensive care units remain full and nurses and first responders call for more protective equipment. The data shows 
492 workers were diagnosed in May, marking a 219% increase from the 154 workers who had tested positive for 
the coronavirus the month before. Human Services Secretary David Scrase told the Albuquerque Journal that the 
increase was expected. The largest increase came in Bernalillo County — home to three of the state's COVID-19 
hub hospitals. San Juan and McKinley counties also had surges. ___ JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia's capital of 
Jakarta, the city hardest hit by the new coronavirus, has partly reopened after two months of partial lockdown as the 
world's fourth most populous nation braces to gradually reopen its economy. The city of 11 million people, with a 
total of 30 million in its greater metropolitan area, has been under large-scale social restrictions since April 10.

https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak10 Rock-Solid Dividend Paying Stocks to Own[1]Historically low 
interest rates have made it difficult over the last decade for income-oriented investors that want to generate safe 
cash flow for their retirements. Dividend-paying stocks have become more appealing to income investors because 
of their competitive yields, the favorite tax treatment that dividends receive and their ability to grow their payouts 
over time. While fixed interest rates from bond investments will lose purchasing power to inflation over time, the 
purchasing power of income from dividend growth stocks is more protected because companies tend raise their 
dividend payments every year. In this slideshow, we look at ten of the best high-dividend stocks that offer strong 
yields (above 3.5%), have consistent cashflow and a strong track record of dividend growth. The companies in this 
slideshow have all raised their dividend every year for the last ten years. These companies also have low payout 
ratios (below 75%), meaning that they will have the ability to continue to pay their dividend if their earnings have a 
temporary dip. Stock prices will always fluctuate, but the dividends paid by these rock-solid dividend payers should 
remain secure with moderate earnings growth. View the "10 Rock-Solid Dividend Paying Stocks to Own"[2]. [ 1]:

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/airlines-seek-quarantine-injunction-as-holiday-bookings-soar/The number of 
Britons booking holidays abroad has doubled in a week amid claims that the 'irrational' quarantine on arrivals in the 
UK could be quashed by the courts.Ryanair, Europe's busiest airline, said today that it had seen a 100 per cent 
increase in the number of people purchasing flights in July and August in the expectation that holidays abroad will 
be given the green light. Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair group chief executive, said the quarantine policy was 'worse 
than useless' and there was a widespread belief that it would not last until the end of the month. International 
Airlines Group (IAG), British Airways' parent company, is planning to file papers with the High Court today 
requesting an urgent hearing to apply for an injunction against the policy. 
The legal challenge is being backed by Ryanair and Easyjet. The comments were made as the first travellers 
arrived in the UK this morning under the quarantine restrictions. As part of the policy, all travellers are required to fill 
in a 'public health passenger locator' form on arrival by air, ferry or through the Channel Tunnel rail link. Arrivals, 
including Britons returning from overseas, are required to provide an address where they will self-isolate for two 
weeks, although they can travel to the property by public transport and embark on food shopping trips. Failure to 
provide an address could result in a 100 fine while those who flout isolation rules can receive a 1,000 penalty. 
There are 42 exempted groups, including hauliers and agricultural workers. About 40 flights landed at Heathrow this 
morning from destinations including the US, Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, Doha, Bahrain, Ethiopia and across 
Europe. However, the chaotic introduction of the measures was criticised today. Lucy Moreton, a professional 
officer at the Immigration Services Union, told the BBC that technical papers explaining what to check for only 
arrived on Friday and were still not available to many border staff. She insisted there was no system for checking 
addresses and that only clear rule-breakers would be picked up. A leaked memo to Border Force officials said that 
only 'manifestly false' information such as an arrival putting down their name as 'Mickey Mouse' or their address as 
'Buckingham Palace' would result in checks. Transport and travel companies are calling for the blanket quarantine 
to be scrapped in favour of more targeted measures, including health checks at airports. They also want 
quarantine-free 'air bridges' to be created between the UK and low-risk countries. The Sun reported today that 
Foreign Office advice against all but essential international travel is expected to be scrapped within days. It would 
provide a further sign that the UK is preparing to allow people to take holidays abroad this summer. Speaking today, 
Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to consider testing people on arrival in the UK rather than imposing the 
Airlines seek quarantine injunction as holiday bookings soar
blanket measures. The Labour leader criticised the policy as an example of the government's 'inconsistency and 
slowness' in responding to the pandemic and questioned why it was necessary at this point. 'Weeks ago other 
countries put quarantine in and we didn't,' Sir Keir told LBC radio. 'Now, as everybody's lifting it, we're putting it in.' 
He added: 'We would like to see a situation where the test was returned within 24 hours. You might have to hold 
people at the airport until that test result was in.' IAG, Easyjet and Ryanair wrote over the weekend to Sir Jonathan 
Jones, the government's most senior legal official, in the first stage of its legal action. They want the measures to be 
suspended pending a review. They are also preparing to lodge papers with the High Court seeking an urgent 
hearing for an injunction. That could take place later this week. Speaking to The Times, Mr O'Leary said that the 
airlines wanted an injunction on the grounds that the policy is 'irrational'. 'It isn't a quarantine,' he said. 'Filling in a 
piece of paper before you are allowed loose on the London Underground or into Sainsbury's and Tesco or onto 
your local beach is not a quarantine. Even the Home Office today confirm that it is unpoliceable and it is 
unimplementable. It is worse than useless. 'We think that the courts will overturn this on the grounds of irrationality 
alone. You haven't got a quarantine and the impression given is deterring thousands of people from coming to the 
UK from countries with lower R-rates than the UK and that will cost thousands of jobs. We think there is a 
reasonable prospect of getting an injunction against it.' Ryanair, which operates from 27 UK airports, is planning to 
introduce 1,000 flights a day across Europe from the start of July. Mr O'Leary said the airline had seen a big 
increase in bookings among UK families seeking to travel to the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. 'Most of the 
traffic will be outbound,' he said. 'Our bookings doubled this weekend compared with the previous weekend, mainly 
with UK families booking holidays to go to the Canaries, the Algarve, the Balearics, Malaga and Italy. 'Most people 
in the UK know that the quarantine is completely bonkers and useless . . . Most are gambling, in my view correctly, 
that the quarantine has so little credibility that it will be removed before the end of June anyway.' Travellers arriving 
at Heathrow this morning described fines for breaking new quarantine rules as 'crazy' and 'terrifying'. However, 
many passengers appeared unfazed as they ambled through arrivals at Terminal 2. Apart from the many 
facemasks being worn, it appeared to be business as usual. Some people were lying on top of their bags while 
others huddled near plug sockets as they waited for families to touch down. All who had just landed have been 
instructed to complete forms detailing where they will isolate for the next 14 days and contact information. Some 
were shocked to learn they faced fines of up to 3,200 for providing the wrong information and 1,000 for failing to self 
isolate. The sudden airport policy shift has prompted passengers to abandon plans to travel to their homes on 
public transport and instead pay for Uber taxis to London. One American passenger flying in to Terminal 2 with his 
girlfriend said: 'I didn't know it was 1,000. I will still comply but 1,000 is crazy. 'I did the form online but my phone 
died, it was a bit of a drama sorting out the phone chargers. But I got it done and the system was pretty easy. 'I 
didn't lie [on the form] but the 3,000 fine is terrifying. I hope they're not actually fining people these insane amounts. 
'I was aware that the police might actually visit your house, knock on the door. It seemed outlandish but we were 
ready for that possibility. 'But overall I think it's good that the UK government has put measures in place to better 
control the virus.' Read more: Airlines seek quarantine injunction as holiday bookings soar[1] [ 1]:

capacity (measured in available seat miles) contracted 93.1% Moreover, consolidated load factor (% of seats filled 
by passengers) fell to 74.8% from 82.1% a year ago. Load factor declined as the fall in traffic was more than 
capacity contraction.Gol Linhas' total monthly departures plunged 93% and seats declined 93.6%.However, with 
air-travel demand improving on the domestic front (domestic demand rose 5% in May compared with April), the

Jun 08, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of GATX 
Corporation GATX[1] have lost 16.1% in the past six months compared with the industry[2]'s 10.9% decline.Let's 
delve deeper to unearth the reasons for the disappointing price performance.GATX is taking a hit from the weak 
performance of the Rail International unit, which is a significant contributor to its top line. Evidently, segmental 
revenues decreased 6.1% in the March quarter due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.Moreover, softness 
in the North American railcar leasing market is worrisome. The railcar leasing space, after having improved in 2018, 
started decelerating again in 2019. The presence of railcar oversupply does not bode well. 
With the ongoing coronavirus-induced downturn, average lease rate on lease renewals is expected to be low in 
2020. This, in turn, is likely to weigh on the Rail North America segment's profitability.Although the impact of the 
coronavirus was limited in the March quarter, a prolonged slowdown in the economy is expected to leave a 
substantial impact on the company's operations and in turn, on its subsequent quarterly results. Notably, GATX 
suspended its previously-announced 2020 guidance due to uncertainties related to the COVID-19 
pandemic.Estimate Revisions &#38; VGM ScoreThe fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 earnings has 
been revised downward to the tune of 28.7% over the past 60 days, is indicative of the negativity surrounding this 
Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock. Moreover, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score[3] of C. Notably, V stands for 
Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. Key PicksInvestors interested in in the broader Zacks Transportation 
[4]sector may consider some better-ranked stocks like Air Lease Corporation AL[5], Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[6] 
and Teekay Tankers Ltd. TNK[7], each currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[8]Long-term earnings (three to five years) growth rate for Air 
Lease, Ryanair Holdings and Teekay Tankers is estimated at 3.1%, 20.5% and 3%, respectively.5 Stocks Set to 
DoubleEach was hand-picked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2020. Each 
comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth.Most of the 
stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground 
floor.Today,

Jun 08, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We recently issued an 
updated report on Trinity Industries, Inc. TRN[1]. Like many other transportation companies, Trinity is hit by 
uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic.Trinity's bottom line declined year over year mainly due to 
disappointing performance of the Rail Products Group. Segmental revenues and operating profit declined, thanks to 
low railcar deliveries and reduced operational efficiency.Trinity Industries, Inc. Price            
https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/TRN/price?icid=chart-TRN-fundamental/price Trinity Industries, Inc. 
price[2] | Trinity Industries, Inc. Quote[3]While first-quarter results weren't affected much, Trinity expects the 
coronavirus pandemic to affect its near-term performance. Weak shipping volumes in Trinity's highway products 
operations might hurt results. To combat the crisis, the company has cut back on non-essential expenses. It 
expects costs to reduce by $25-$30 million in 2020 on the back of these endeavors. Lower investments might 
hamper its growth prospects.Moreover, since E. Jean Savage took over as the company's president and CEO, 
replacing the company's long-serving CEO Timothy R. Wallace, it is feared that investors' confidence in the stock 
may take a hit.Meanwhile, Trinity's top-line performance in first-quarter 2020 is impressive owing to higher railcar 
volumes. Also, at the end of the first quarter, Trinity did not have any short-term debt, while its cash and cash 
equivalents stood at $213 million at the end of the same period.Zacks Ranks &#38; Key PicksTrinity currently 
carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation [4]sector 
are Air Lease Corporation AL[5], Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[6] and Teekay Tankers Ltd. TNK[7]. All the stocks 
carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks

move is in accordance with the directive of the U.S. Department of Transportation, which allowed airlines to adjust 
their operations and reschedule flights wherever 'reasonable and practicable'. With demand being persistently tepid 
at the following destinations, namely Aspen, CO, Bangor, ME, Erie, PA, Flint, MI, Fort Smith, AR, Lincoln, NE, New 
Bern/Morehead/Beaufort, NC, Peoria, IL, Santa Barbara, CA, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, PA and Williston, ND, Delta 
suspended operations to these destinations, which make up approximately 5% of its domestic services. Despite 
Delta suspending operations at these airports, they will continue to be served by at least one other 
carrier.Moreover, management decided to re-accommodate the concerned passengers on account of its above 
made decision. 
Further, this Atlanta, GA-based carrier decided to indefinitely suspend flights to Ottawa from Jun 21 onward due to 
lackluster demand.With Delta like other airlines trimming capacity to compensate for this extremely bleak scenario, 
Delta announced an 85% reduction in its schedule for the June quarter. Of the total, 80% cut will be on the 
domestic front and 90% internationally.Zacks Ranks &#38; Key PicksDelta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3

The chief executive of British Airways owner IAG has said he is considering legal action over the UK government's 
quarantine travel rules, which he claimed had "torpedoed" plans to restart passenger flights next month.
Willie Walsh said IAG was consulting lawyers on possible action into what he called "terrible" measures requiring 
international passengers to self-isolate for 14 days after arriving in the UK by air.
"We think it's irrational and disproportionate and we are giving consideration to a legal challenge to this legislation 
so we are reviewing that with lawyers later today," the airline chief told Sky News yesterday.
"I suspect there are other airlines who are doing so because it's important to point out there was no consultation 
with the industry prior to enacting this legislation and we do believe it's an irrational piece of legislation," Mr Walsh 
added.
Mr Walsh's threat follows weeks of tension between the government and BA over coronavirus-related travel 
restrictions and the carrier's decision to cut up to 12,000 jobs.
Other airlines have echoed BA's unhappiness with the 14-day rule, which will come into force from June 8. Michael 
O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, has called the policy "pointless posturing", while József Váradi, Wizz Air's head, 
said the measures were "extreme" and "very harsh".

Industry leaders fear quarantine could stop any meaningful restart of business during the industry's critical summer 
period and argue it is based on scant scientific evidence. In March, the government's advisory group Sage said 
border closures would have a "negligible effect" on the spread of Covid-19.
Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents the sector, is among those calling for air bridges 
allowing visitors to arrive without the need to isolate.
"The government needs to ask whether it wants any connectivity this summer," he said on Thursday. "If it does then 
it must work to get travel corridors established as soon as possible." But Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, has 
insisted quarantine rules offer meaningful protection against coronavirus. "We need to take steps now to manage 
the risk of imported cases triggering a second peak," he said this week. Responding to Mr Walsh's threat of legal 
action, Mr Johnson's spokesperson said yesterday: "We want to work with industry across the board and that 
includes with BA."
In a letter sent to MPs on Thursday, Mr Walsh said BA had hoped to operate about 40 per cent of its scheduled 
flights in July but that the plans had been "torpedoed" by the introduction of the quarantine rules.
"British Airways is not generating any revenues and continues to burn through approximately £20m of cash a day. 
The current situation is not sustainable," he wrote. The company had already taken on an additional £800m of 
short-term debt, he added.
He said he had had "no contact" with the secretary of state or aviation minister concerning the measures, aside 
from a 25-minute conference call made on March 18.
When Priti Patel, the home secretary, and Kelly Tolhurst, the aviation minister, met industry heads yesterday, IAG 
did not attend.
Mr Johnson's spokesperson said the government was "disappointed" that the airline chose not to attend yesterday's 
meeting to discuss the quarantine plans.

M y column on air passengers' difficulties in obtaining the refunds to which they are legally entitled prompted many 
responses. Readers had their own stories and some, as we shall see, thought I had been unfair. To make up for the 
cancellation of ceremonies such as the Oliviers and the Turner Prize, I have decided to group the reactions into a 
series of awards.
The Loreto Prize This is named after Our Lady of Loreto, patron saint of aviation. The prize goes to below-the-line 
commenter Jacques5646, who said that while he "felt sorry for those low-cost users who have painstakingly saved 
the money for their annual vacation", the rest of us should consider the airline workers whose jobs were at stake 
and the airlines that risked going bust. Music-festival ticket holders were holding off on demanding refunds in order 
to save the events for future years, he said. "What about [doing the same for] your favourite airline (even if it treats 
you more and more like cattle)?" The Severus Snape Award This prize takes its name from the villainous Harry 
Potter character who had, it transpired, been carrying out valorous deeds all along. Last time, I shamed British 
Airways for offering vouchers online but requiring passengers who wanted refunds to call a number, which was 
often impossible to reach. BA has long been a villain for this column's readers, but on this occasion many leapt to 
its defence. "I phoned BA, got through in under two minutes, had a full cash refund offered within a few minutes and 
... received the money in my bank account two days later," one reader emailed me.
The award goes to Ryanair for its failure to answer the question: 'Which part of the law don't you understand?' The 
Granny Award This prize is based on an interview Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, gave to the FT in 
2003, in which he told passengers who asked for their money back because their granny was ill: "What part of no 
refund don't you understand?" One FT reader told me that after weeks of waiting for his Ryanair refund, he 
contacted the airline via Twitter. "I duly received an email which I foolishly thought might contain the details of my 
Michael Skapinker Business travel
refund." Instead, it had a voucher attached. "If I did not want this voucher then I should click on the link for a full 
refund. Guess where that took me? Yes, to the Ryanair page where you could claim YOUR VOUCHER." The rules 
do not require airlines to refund money if the passenger's granny is ill, but they do require a prompt refund when 
flights are cancelled. Ryanair told me that anyone who didn't want a voucher would get their money "once this 
unprecedented crisis is over".
So the Granny Award goes, fittingly, to Ryanair, for its failure to know the answer to the question "Which part of the 
law don't you understand?" The Brass Neck Trophy This goes to Air France-KLM for palming off an FT reader by 
saying that a number of EU member states had asked the European Commission to amend the rule that 
passengers have a right to their money back. Some governments have indeed made this request, but the 
Commission has said no. But what clinched the prize was the airline telling the customer that "in the Netherlands, 
the Minister of Infrastructure & Water Management, who has responsibility for transport, instructed the Transport 
Inspectorate to accept that airlines do not have to refund the ticket price to passengers" - despite the clarity of the 
EU law to the contrary. I had hoped to present Air France-KLM with a proper trophy of a brass neck but, with factory 
closures, this has not been possible, so I hope they will accept a voucher.

M y column on air passengers' difficulties in obtaining the refunds to which they are legally entitled prompted many 
responses. Readers had their own stories and some, as we shall see, thought I had been unfair. To make up for the 
cancellation of ceremonies such as the Oliviers and the Turner Prize, I have decided to group the reactions into a 
series of awards.
The Loreto Prize This is named after Our Lady of Loreto, patron saint of aviation. The prize goes to below-the-line 
commenter Jacques5646, who said that while he "felt sorry for those low-cost users who have painstakingly saved 
the money for their annual vacation", the rest of us should consider the airline workers whose jobs were at stake 
and the airlines that risked going bust. Music-festival ticket holders were holding off on demanding refunds in order 
to save the events for future years, he said. "What about [doing the same for] your favourite airline (even if it treats 
you more and more like cattle)?" The Severus Snape Award This prize takes its name from the villainous Harry 
Potter character who had, it transpired, been carrying out valorous deeds all along. Last time, I shamed British 
Airways for offering vouchers online but requiring passengers who wanted refunds to call a number, which was 
often impossible to reach. BA has long been a villain for this column's readers, but on this occasion many leapt to 
its defence. "I phoned BA, got through in under two minutes, had a full cash refund offered within a few minutes and 
... received the money in my bank account two days later," one reader emailed me.

Taoiseach tells holidaymakers summer is not yet lost

Ireland hopes to be able to recommend the resumption of air travel with a select number of countries in a number of 
weeks, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Thursday, telling prospective holidaymakers "summer is not yet lost."
Some European countries such as Germany, Spain and Austria plan to lift coronavirus-related border restrictions 
with neighboring countries this month, something Ireland has been more cautious about as it slowly reopens its 
economy.
Ireland requires anyone entering the country to self-isolate for 14 days and foresees making its first step back to 
non-essential travel via so-called "air bridges" with other countries who share low levels of coronavirus infection.
"I hope that as the world returns to a new normality, we will see international air travel resume, in the first instance 
through air bridges with countries that have suppressed the virus to a similar extent as ours," Varadkar told 
parliament.
"This however is some weeks away and it's far too soon for anyone to book their holidays yet but summer is not yet 
lost."
Ireland has reported 1,659 deaths related to just over 25,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease the novel 
coronavirus causes. The number of cases, deaths and admissions to hospital have all been falling in recent weeks.
The government will review the 14-day quarantine for travelers on June 18. Airlines, in particular Ireland's Ryanair , 
have pushed back strongly against the rules that they say are impossible to implement.

Varadkar also reiterated on Thursday that he hopes to announce a speeding up of the reopening plan on Friday 
ahead of entering the second of five phases next week. (Reuters)

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), which has warned it may cut up to 3,000 jobs in Europe, told employees in France it was 
cutting pilots' salaries by 20% and those of flight attendants by 10%, the news agency AFP reported. Those already 
on a minimum wage will have their hours reduced. Unions accused the company of "redundancy blackmail." The 
LCC's ultimatum to its French employees is to choose between the five-year pay cut or accept redundancies, 
including 29% of pilot jobs lost and 27% for co-pilots. According to confidential documents seen by local media, 
Ryanair proposed that the wage cuts would take effect from July 1 and progressively increase to eventually reach 
their current levels by July 2025. For pilots, this would mean a 12% loss of salary on average during the period. For 
cabin crew, paid working time would drop from 2,000 to 1,600 hours a year, resulting in a loss of EUR308 
(USD345) per month for those earning EUR1,539 (USD1,725) monthly, according to unions, taking it below the 
minimum wage. The Syndicat National des Pilots de Ligne and the cabin crew union SNPNC-FO both said they had 
been given five days to respond.

scores closest to five being the most favorable. Ryanair earned a media sentiment score of -2.80 on their scale. 
InfoTrie also assigned media coverage about the transportation company an news buzz score of 1 out of 10, 
indicating that recent media coverage is extremely unlikely to have an effect on the stock's share price in the

and Ryanair even refused to participate in an industry conference call with the U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel and 
Kelly Tolhurst, the junior aviation minister, to discuss the quarantine.A Whitehall government official criticized BA for 
missing the conference call.'It's a shame that British Airways don't want to directly make their case to the home 
secretary and the aviation minister. Clearly they aren't serious about working with the government to get Britain 
moving again,' the source said.Under the proposed rules, anyone arriving in the U.K. by plane, ferry or train - 
including British citizens -- will have to self-isolate for 14 days and fill out a form notifying authorities where they will 
be located. 
In England people could be fined up to 1,000 ($1,270) if they fail to self-isolate.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said 
the quarantine will commence on Monday.BA, a subsidiary of International Airlines Group, or IAG, said it may also 
file a legal challenge against the quarantine. Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG[2], said the government did not 
consult with the airline industry prior to the rule change.'I wrote to MPs [Thursday] night to say this [quarantine] 
initiative has in effect torpedoed our opportunity to get flying in July,' Walsh said. 'We think it is irrational, we think it 
is disproportionate and we are giving consideration to a legal challenge to this legislation.'British Airways, Walsh 
added, 'is not generating any revenues and continues to burn through approximately 20 million ($25.3 million) of 
cash a day.'The current situation is not sustainable,' he wrote, adding the company has taken on an additional 800 
million ($1 billion) of short-term debt.David Davis[3], the former Brexit secretary and MP for Haltemprice and 
Howden, told the Guardian newspaper: 'It is entirely understandable that BA would consider taking legal action. The 
government position does appear to be irrational. As far as I can see there is no risk in accepting people from other 
countries which have lower infection rates than ours, in fact there is a greater risk if people travel to London from 
my constituency.'Alex Cruz, the chief executive of BA, warned that the quarantine proposal represented 'another 
blow' to a company that is rapidly losing cash and has already laid off thousands of workers.During the industry call 
with Patel, aviation officials suggested the quarantine be in place for only three weeks until the first review date on 
June 29. Patel apparently made no promises but listened to the airline industry's pleas.'Protecting lives will always 
be our top priority, but I am [sensitive] to the impact on your sector and I'm asking you to work with us on this,' Patel 
UK Government's Proposed 14-Day Quarantine Rule Widely Panned By Airlines, Tories, Business Groups
said on the call. 'I know you share my commitment to protecting passengers and the whole of our country from a 
second wave of coronavirus We're listening and we want to find solutions together, that's why we're here 
today.'Tollhurst already criticized BA for cutting 12,000 jobs while it was still benefitting from the government's wage 
subsidy furlough scheme.Tom Burridge[4], the transport correspondent at BBC, wrote that aviation bosses were 
'fuming' about the quarantine, and the conference call with Patel likely made things worse.'They feel they got no 
reassurances from Priti Patel that the quarantine would be reduced in any significant way soon by agreeing [to] so-
called 'air bridges' [safe corridors between the U.K. and countries with low infection rates meaning people won't 
have to self-isolate after they travel],' he wrote. 'The fact that BA's parent company IAG didn't even attend the call is 
the ultimate sign that relations between the government and U.K. aviation are at rock bottom.'Michael O'Leary, chief 
executive of Ryanair, also criticized the quarantine, citing the rule to self-isolate would "significantly reduce 
European visitors' to the U.K.A spokesman for Virgin Atlantic stated: 'The introduction of mandatory 14-day self-
isolation for every single traveler entering the U.K. will reduce customer demand significantly and prevent a 
resumption of services at scale."Some Conservative Members of Parliament have also blasted the quarantine 
proposals, citing they will harm the airlines and ruin Britons' hopes of summer holidays. Tories have implored the 
government to keep the quarantine period to a minimum.Huw Merriman[5], Conservative chair of the Commons 
transport committee, described the quarantine as 'the wrong policy at the worst possible time.'Unions have also 
criticized the plan.Lucy Moreton of the Immigration Services Union, which represents about 4,000 Border Force 
members, called the rules 'farcical' since passengers could fill in fictitious information on forms when they arrive. 
Border Force officers would then have no way to verify their information.The Confederation of British Industry, or 
CBI, warned the quarantine proposal would have widespread economic impact.The CBI's president John Allen 
urged 
the 
government 
to 
avoid 
'unnecessary 
burdens 
that 
hurt 
future 
growth.'

 Ryanair (RYA.L) said on Friday it would support any legal action launched by British Airways parent International 
Consolidated Airlines (IAG.L) against the government's proposed 14-day quarantine for travelers arriving in the UK, 
according to media reports. 
Recent reports said that International Consolidated Airlines was considering taking legal action against the 
government's proposed 14-day quarantine that is set to come into effect on June 8 on claims that the quarantine 
rule is "irrational" as well as "disproportionate."
Previously, Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary labeled the quarantine plan as "nonsense" and said it 
would be "useless."

The Taoiseach on Friday advised citizens not to book foreign holidays and said the government had no date in 
mind yet to end its 14-day quarantine for people arriving from abroad.
"I'd encourage people not to go booking flights or anything like that just yet. That would be premature," Leo 
Varadkar said, adding that the government was studying the impact of the resumption of flights in other countries.
The government is due to consider whether to extend its 14-day quarantine for incoming travellers, which the Irish 
airline Ryanair has said is blocking a restart of Irish tourism, on June 18. (Reuters)

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/british-airways-threatens-legal-action-over-irrational-quarantine-
measures/The government is facing legal action over its decision to quarantine all arrivals into the UK amid 
warnings that the 'irrational' policy will be catastrophic for airlines.British Airways' parent company today confirmed 
that it was consulting lawyers in an attempt to block the policy, which is due to be introduced from Monday. Willie 
Walsh, the chief executive of International Airlines Group (IAG), said that it was likely that other airlines would also 
bring legal challenges against the measures. 
He insisted that the quarantine, which is applied to foreign arrivals and Britons returning from overseas, was an 
'irrational piece of legislation' and had 'torpedoed' BA's attempts to resume flight operations in July. It had hoped to 
operate 40 per cent of flights next month. The comments have been made only three days before the policy is due 
to be introduced for people arriving in the UK by air, ferry and through the Channel tunnel rail link. Under the 
reforms, all arrivals will be forced to self-isolate for two weeks, with the possibility of 1,000 fines for those who flout 
the rules. About 40 groups will be exempt, including hauliers and airline crew. However, the measures have been 
condemned by backbench MPs, airlines and holiday companies, while scientists have queried their effectiveness. 
The UK is believed to be the only big country to impose a new quarantine so late in the pandemic and experts have 
asked whether it will be helpful in controlling a second outbreak of the infection in the UK. More than 300 travel and 
hospitality businesses have signed a letter to Priti Patel, the home secretary, opposing the plan, with some warning 
that they will go bust or be forced to lay off 60 per cent of staff because of the loss of income. The policy will be 
reviewed every three weeks and the government has indicated that it will eventually be replaced with more focused 
'air bridges' that allow quarantine-free travel from low-risk countries. Countries such as Greece, Portugal, Spain and 
Turkey are already believed to be in talks with the UK government over the move. However, Mr Walsh said that 
airlines were hoping to get the policy quashed — possibly before it is introduced — because of concerns over the 
way it has been implemented. He said that airlines were not consulted in advance and it would have no bearing on 
the control of the virus. Large numbers of airlines, including Ryanair, Easyjet, Jet2, Virgin Atlantic and TUI, are 
planning to resurrect flight operations from late June and into July. However, it is feared that the quarantine will 
prevent most people booking to fly in and out of the UK. One study this week suggested that only a fifth of people 
would risk flying while the measures remain in place. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Walsh said: 'This initiative has in 
effect torpedoed our opportunity to get flying in July. We think it is irrational, we think it is disproportionate and we 
British Airways threatens legal action over 'irrational' quarantine measures
are giving consideration to a legal challenge to this legislation. So we are reviewing that with the lawyers later on 
today. 'I suspect that there are other airlines that are doing so because it is important to point out that there was no 
consultation with the industry prior to enacting this legislation and we do believe it is an irrational piece of 
legislation.' IAG wrote to MPs on Thursday outlining the challenges the company faces and defending its decision 
to make 12,000 BA staff redundant. The company has faced criticism over the move, which is still subject to 
consultation, after it accepted tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money through the government's job retention 
scheme. In his letter Mr Walsh said: 'There are some who believe the company is exaggerating the scale of the 
challenge. Nothing could be further from the truth. The situation is unprecedented. Nobody is flying. 'British Airways 
had hoped to operate about 40 per cent of our scheduled flights in July but this has been torpedoed by the 
introduction of the 14-day quarantine period for people arriving into the UK. British Airways is not generating any 
revenues and continues to burn through approximately 20 million of cash a day. The current situation is not 
sustainable. 'The company has already taken on an additional 800 million of short-term debt to supplement its cash 
position. That debt must be repaid.' On Thursday afternoon Ms Patel had an online meeting with airlines to discuss 
the policy. BA boycotted the meeting amid opposition to the measures. The home secretary told aviation bosses: 
'To stop this disease in its tracks we've had to make some tough choices, huge sacrifices have already been made, 
and I know how hard the new measures will be for you all. 'But we're here because we all share one aim: to keep 
people safe and get Britain moving again.' She added: 'We have all made sacrifices in recent weeks as part of an 
extraordinary national effort to beat coronavirus, and while the safety of our people is at risk this must continue. 
'The new public health measures at the border are essential to protect the hard-won progress we have made and 
help prevent a second wave.' Read more: British Airways threatens legal action over 'irrational' quarantine

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/british-airways-shuns-priti-patel-meeting-over-quarantine-plans/A 
row 
has 
broken out between Priti Patel and British Airways over the plans to quarantine travellers for 14 days as the airline 
refused to meet her, and a government source branded the company 'not serious about getting Britain working 
again'.Tensions between the government and the airline escalated on Thursday, as Alex Cruz, the chief executive 
of BA, declined to join an industry call with Patel, the home secretary, and Kelly Tolhurst, the aviation minister. 
Conservative MPs are up in arms about the quarantine proposals, arguing they will harm airlines and dash people's 
hopes of summer holidays, but Boris Johnson insisted this week that the policy will go ahead from Monday as an 
essential way of stopping new outbreaks of coronavirus. 
Earlier on Thursday, Cruz had warned employees that BA's parent company was haemorrhaging cash and accused 
the government of dealing 'another blow' by pressing ahead with the plan to quarantine inbound travellers for 14 
days at a time when many other countries are lifting such measures. Airports, aviation bodies and almost every 
other major airline apart from Ryanair were on the call with Patel. A source said the industry made the case for the 
quarantine rules to be in place for three weeks only until the first review date on 29 June. A source close to the talks 
said that BA's team had advised Cruz that it 'wasn't worth his time engaging'. The approach appears to have gone 
down badly with the government, with a Whitehall source saying: 'It's a shame that British Airways don't want to 
directly make their case to the home secretary and the aviation minister. Clearly they aren't serious about working 
with the government to get Britain moving again.' It comes the day after Tolhurst had already criticised BA for its 
move to cut thousands of jobs and change terms and conditions while workers are on the government-funded 
furlough scheme. One person with knowledge of the call said the home secretary made no promises but had been 
in 'listening mode'. She told the airlines that she understood the urgency and would work together with other 
government departments, having already told Tory rebels against the plan that it was a 'temporary, time-limited 
policy' to help reduce the spread of transmission. The source said: 'It was the meeting she should have had months 
ago.' During the meeting, Patel told the airlines: 'Protecting lives will always be our top priority, but I am alive to the 
impact on your sector and I'm asking you to work with us on this I know you share my commitment to protecting 
passengers and the whole of our country from a second wave of coronavirus We're listening and we want to find 
solutions together, that's why we're here today.' Many Tory MPs opposed to the plans and the airlines believe the 
quarantine measures will be shortlived - possibly three or six weeks - before being replaced by so-called air bridges 
British Airways shuns Priti Patel meeting over quarantine plans
involving reciprocal arrangements with other countries that have similar infection rates. No 10 is cautious about 
promising air bridges just yet as some countries are not keen to allow in British travellers without quarantine when 
the UK's transmission rate is still high. However, some cabinet ministers and dozens of Conservative MPs are 
pushing for the quarantine to be as short as possible because of the economic impact of the policy on the aviation 
industry and worries about job losses. Treasury sources said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, believes a time-limited 
quarantine period for travellers will have a 'negligible' economic impact but if the policy were to continue for a longer 
period of many months, then 'that would be another matter'. Scientists have already criticised the quarantine 
arrangements for not having enough of an impact. Unions also have deep concerns about the consequences of the 
plan. Lucy Moreton, from the Immigration Services Union (ISU), which represents around 4,000 Border Force 
members, branded the system 'farcical' and said passengers could fill 'complete rubbish' into the address form and 
there is no way for Border Force officers to verify whether it is correct. She said: 'That data is passed on to PHE 
who then determine how many will be contacted by phone. It's widely believed to be about 10% will be telephoned. 
'But they will be phoned on the number they provide Police forces have been clear they don't have resources to be 
chasing around after this. The chances of them visiting, unless there's another criminal contact, is zero to nil.' Read

Golar LNG Rides On Strong FLNG Hilli Episeyo Operations

Jun 05, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We recently issued an 
updated report on Golar LNG Limited GLNG[1].In May, Golar LNG delivered an increase in first-quarter 2020 
revenues. The upside can be partly attributed to an impressive performance at FLNG and strong seasonal results in 
shipping. Notably, FLNG Hilli Episeyo maintained its 100% commercial uptime in the March quarter. 
In the event of FLNG's strong performance continuing in the upcoming quarters, results will be aided significantly. 
Successful operation of the FLNG Hilli Episeyo is another upside and will likely continue boosting 
results.Additionally, the partnership with BR Distribuidora and utilization of spare capacity on FSRU Golar Nanook, 
in response to low LNG prices is expected to help the company generate substantial earnings in the short-to-
medium term.Besides, commencement of operations from the FLNG Unit, Gimi (production commencing from 
fourth-quarter 2022) is expected to generate annual EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortization) of around $215 million or more.Like many other transportation companies, Golar LNG is hit by 
uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak has significantly hampered prospects by disrupting 
supply chain.Also, Golar LNG has a debt-laden balance sheet. The company exited the first quarter with cash and 
cash equivalents of $227 million, far below the short-term debt of $1233 million. This indicates that the company 
doesn't have enough cash to meet its short-term debt burden.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderGolar LNG 
currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors can also consider some other top-ranked stocks from the broader 
Zacks Transportation [2]sector like Air Lease Corporation AL[3], Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[4] and Teekay

Soccer club Tottenham among firms to tap virus loan scheme
Soccer club Tottenham among firms to tap virus loan scheme

Body
LONDON (AP) - British Airways, Marks & Spencer and even Premier League soccer club Tottenham Hotspur are 
among 53 big companies to take advantage of a special coronavirus loan scheme from the Bank of England to tide 
them over during the pandemic.
The central bank revealed Thursday for the first time the list of companies that have taken up its COVID Corporate 
Financing Facility, a scheme designed for big companies with sizeable operations in the U.K.
The biggest single loan of 1 billion pounds ($1.25 billion) went to German chemical company BASF. British Airways, 
via its parent group International Airlines Group, borrowed 300 million pounds, while Marks & Spencer borrowed 
260 million pounds. Tottenham has borrowed 175 million pounds.
The facility is one of many measures that the central bank and the Treasury have put in place to assist businesses 
through the disruption caused by the outbreak and the lockdown. Under the scheme, the bank buys the short term 
debt of firms that are assessed to make a "material contribution" to the U.K. economy.
Many of the companies that took up the facility are in sectors that have seen business come to a virtual standstill.
Chief among these is the airlines sector, which has laid off thousands of staff as planes are grounded. Alongside 
British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air have borrowed hundreds of millions of pounds.
Train and bus operators, such as National Express and Stagecoach, have used the scheme. Even the National 
Trust, which looks after the nation's natural and historic sites, borrowed 30 million pounds.
Car manufacturers, including Honda, Nissan and Toyota, have also borrowed 1 billion pounds collectively.
The auto sector's problems were thrown in sharp relief Thursday with the news that Aston Martin, which is famous 
for making James Bond's car of choice, plans to cut up to 500 jobs. Car dealership Lookers plans to shed another 
1,500 jobs
Soccer club Tottenham among firms to tap virus loan scheme
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said Thursday that new car sales were down 89% in May from the 
year before, and were at their lowest level for the month since 1952. The overall market is now down 51.4% in the 
first five months of 2020, with showrooms allowed to reopen only on June 1.
"Restarting this market is a crucial first step in driving the recovery of Britain's critical car manufacturers and supply 
chain, and to supporting the wider economy," said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.
Companies have largely held off from cutting jobs during the lockdown as a result of the Job Retention Scheme, 
under which the government pays up to 80% of the salaries of workers retained, up to 2,500 pounds ($3,125) a 
month.
Treasury chief Rishi Sunak said last week that from August, firms will have to start making contributions to the 
salaries of workers that are retained but not working, and that the scheme will close two months later.
That's raised concerns that Britain will see a spike in unemployment then. In total, 8.7 million jobs have been 
furloughed under the scheme at a cost of 17.5 billion pounds. Even if 10% of those lose their jobs, it would increase 
unemployment substantially. In March, there were an estimated 1.35 million people unemployed.

Ryanair Austrian unit reaches deal avoiding shutdown

Austrian business and labour groups have struck a deal on a collective wage agreement at Ryanair's Lauda airline 
to ensure its Vienna base will not shut down, though the parent company has yet to approve it, those groups said 
on Thursday.
Lauda had said on Friday it was shutting down its Vienna base after failing to reach an agreement with the union on 
pay. The move would have involved the loss of around 370 jobs in Lauda.
"After long and difficult negotiations and repeated attempts by the WKO to bring about a compromise, a solution for 
a collective wage agreement was achieved on Wednesday night," the Chamber of Commerce (WKO), which 
represents businesses in negotiations with unions, said in a statement.
Austria's Vida union said the deal lasting until 2023 involved a gross monthly wage of 1,440 euros for flight 
attendants and 2,000 euros for co-pilots, but Lauda management and Ryanair have yet to give their approval.
"It is now up to Laudamotion and Ryanair to accept the Austrian social partners' collective wage agreement and 
thereby save its employees' jobs and its base at Vienna airport," Vida said in a statement, using Lauda's legal 
name, Laudamotion GmbH. The WKO and unions are referred to as social partners.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary had previously said that the group would close Lauda's main hub in the 
Austrian capital and bring in Ryanair jets instead unless the staff agreed to a pay cut and a new labour agreement.
Vida had long refused to agree to Lauda's proposals as it said they would hit some employees unacceptably hard, 
provoking criticism from some staff who said they wanted their jobs saved. Pilots in particular had opposed the 
union. (Reuters)

Flag carrier bailouts will harm Europe's airline industry

C ovid-19 is a catastrophe for Europe, its citizens and its businesses. Few industries have been hit as hard as the 
airline sector. Carriers that are essential for Europe's connectivity and are the lifeblood of business activity and 
tourism have seen demand collapse and their viability jeopardised.
With the right response, we can keep the catastrophe short-term. But by letting the richest European countries once 
again prop up their bloated flag carriers, with no or inadequate conditions attached, the EU risks damaging the 
health of European aviation and the single market long after the pandemic has gone. This would be a betrayal of 
the EU's historic success in building a dynamic single market in air travel.
Of course, European companies and employees need short-term support. And there are some good examples of 
schemes open to all airlines, such as the UK's Covid Corporate Financing Facility. Germany has allowed all airlines 
to defer payment of air travel taxes.
Sadly, though, these are exceptions. Italy's (EURO)500m Covid-19 fund is limited to airlines with a licence issued 
by Italy, in breach of EU rules. France will only defer taxes for French flag carriers. And Sweden has excluded all 
airlines based outside its territory from its (EURO)455m loan guarantee scheme.
An eye-watering (EURO)9bn has already been approved without conditions to prop up Air France, SAS, Condor 
and Finnair; over the weekend, the commission dropped its original demands and agreed a much-diluted package 
of commitments in exchange for a record (EURO)9bn in state aid to Lufthansa; more is on the way such as the 
pledged (EURO)2bn-(EURO)4bn aid package from the Netherlands for KLM.
Flag carrier bailouts will harm Europe's airline industry
Ryanair has not received any aid granted to country of origin airlines. Nor are we asking for it. But we do want a 
level playing field. We are a truly European airline, not a national one. We have always responded to crises by 
tightening our belt and innovating. This is the way forward for European aviation.
The EU needs to rediscover the courage it had when it took on vested interests and created the single aviation 
regime: for the first time airlines could fly to and from anywhere in Europe. This was a regulatory revolution. We and 
other low-fare airlines turned it into commercial reality, creating new routes at affordable prices, changing the 
mindset of European travellers and transforming the economic fortunes of isolated regions and depressed cities 
across the continent.
Today's bailouts are regressive, unfair and unlawful. They will set the clock back, threatening the future of 
European aviation at least as much as the pandemic itself. The commission must defend its independence, stand 
firm against powerful member states, uphold the law, and build a single, coherent framework that promotes 
competitiveness, connectivity and a cleaner environment.
State support must be allowed only on strict conditions: it must not be reserved for airlines originating in the country 
granting the aid, it must be accessible to all, time-limited, and targeted on relieving cash flow issues, like payroll 
support and suspension or deferral of aviation taxes, airport fees and air traffic control charges. The commission 
must tackle the biggest distortion of all: the bias in favour of national airlines from big countries with deep pockets.
Covid-19 is receding to the point where we can prepare to resume flying in time for summer. With the right health 
measures in place, this will kickstart the tourist industry. Now is not the time to unwind the single market and undo 
its enormous benefits.
After all we have been through, it would be a tragedy if European air transport emerges from the pandemic less 
competitive than before, with inefficient monopolies effectively renationalised and free to increase fares, reduce 
choice and engage in predatory conduct that drives low-cost competitors from the market.

 Deutsche Lufthansa Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr on Wednesday acknowledged that the German 
government's 9 billion euros ($10.08 billion) bailout package is greater than needed, London's Financial Times 
reported the same day.
The statement came as the European Commission advised against providing the airline company an unfair 
advantage and Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) threatened a lawsuit if the regulators approve the bailout.
"The German government was focused on how Lufthansa can maintain its position as a German global champion, 
not just how it can avoid insolvency," Spohr added.

Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr has admitted the group's (EURO)9bn bailout from the German 
government is more than it needs to survive, and is designed to ensure the airline maintains a "global leading 
position".
Mr Spohr's comments come after the European Commission warned against state aid being used to give the group 
an unfair advantage and strong criticism from low-cost rival Ryanair, which has pledged to launch a legal challenge 
once the bailout is approved by antitrust authorities.
Margrethe Vestager, EU competition chief, said last Friday there was a "high risk" of market distortion, as she 
defended Brussels' demands for Lufthansa to relinquish lucrative slots at Frankfurt and Munich airports.
Yesterday, after Lufthansa's supervisory board had accepted the EU's conditions, Mr Spohr conceded that with 
(EURO)4bn in existing liquidity, the Frankfurt-based group did not need the full (EURO)9bn from the administration 
of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Asked by the FT if Lufthansa could have got by with less, Mr Spohr said: "Yes, but it was not just about survival."
He added: "The German government was focused on how Lufthansa can maintain its position as a German global 
champion, not just how it can avoid insolvency."
Lufthansa admits aid exceeds its needs Airlines ; Chief concedes Berlin's (EURO)9bn is about maintaining 
clout as much as survival
Speaking to analysts earlier, he said the airline sought a larger sum because "we didn't want to go to the edge of 
what we needed". "We are Germans, we are boring, we love safety," he said.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said Mr Spohr's comments confirmed the Irish carrier's position that the 
state aid was illegal.
Lufthansa was going to maintain its position as a global brand solely due to its "government's crack cocaine", he 
told the FT, adding that the rescue package "massively distorts the playing field" for European airlines.
Mr O'Leary warned that Ryanair's legal challenge could drag on for several years, by which stage "untold damage 
will have been done" to competitors.
In an article for the FT today, Mr O'Leary warns that the EU is waving through state aid for airlines with "no or 
inadequate conditions attached".
But Mr Spohr insisted Lufthansa's package - the largest corporate bailout in Germany since the start of the Covid-
19 crisis - was "very much in line with the size of the company".
Lufthansa, which includes Austrian, Brussels, Swiss and Eurowings airlines, has also been seeking state aid from

Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr has admitted the group's (EURO)9bn bailout from the German 
government is more than it needs to survive, and is designed to ensure the airline maintains a "global leading 
position".
Mr Spohr's comments come after the European Commission warned against state aid being used to give the group 
an unfair advantage and strong criticism from low-cost rival Ryanair, which has pledged to launch a legal challenge 
once the bailout is approved by antitrust authorities.
Margrethe Vestager, EU competition chief, said last Friday there was a "high risk" of market distortion, as she 
defended Brussels' demands for Lufthansa to relinquish lucrative slots at Frankfurt and Munich airports.
Yesterday, after Lufthansa's supervisory board had accepted the EU's conditions, Mr Spohr conceded that with 
(EURO)4bn in existing liquidity, the Frankfurt-based group did not need the full (EURO)9bn from the administration 
of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Asked by the FT if Lufthansa could have got by with less, Mr Spohr said: "Yes, but it was not just about survival."
He added: "The German government was focused on how Lufthansa can maintain its position as a German global 
champion, not just how it can avoid insolvency."
Lufthansa admits aid exceeds its needs Airlines ; Chief concedes Berlin's (EURO)9bn is about maintaining 
clout as much as survival
Speaking to analysts earlier, he said the airline sought a larger sum because "we didn't want to go to the edge of 
what we needed". "We are Germans, we are boring, we love safety," he said.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said Mr Spohr's comments confirmed the Irish carrier's position that the 
state aid was illegal.
Lufthansa was going to maintain its position as a global brand solely due to its "government's crack cocaine", he 
told the FT, adding that the rescue package "massively distorts the playing field" for European airlines.
Mr O'Leary warned that Ryanair's legal challenge could drag on for several years, by which stage "untold damage 
will have been done" to competitors.
In an article for the FT today, Mr O'Leary warns that the EU is waving through state aid for airlines with "no or 
inadequate conditions attached".
But Mr Spohr insisted Lufthansa's package - the largest corporate bailout in Germany since the start of the Covid-
19 crisis - was "very much in line with the size of the company".
Lufthansa, which includes Austrian, Brussels, Swiss and Eurowings airlines, has also been seeking state aid from 
other European governments.

Malta Air, a subsidiary of Irish holding company Ryanair Holdings, has started laying off staff due to the financial 
impact of the coronavirus crisis. Due to Malta Air's three-month grounding due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 
company told employees that redundancies were "unavoidable". In a memo to staff sent on May 29, and seen by 
Malta Today, the carrier said: "We regret to inform you that due to the COVID-19 crisis and the failure of our recent 
discussions with the ERCs [employee representative committees] to agree reasonable pay cuts, we need to make 
significant cost-reductions and implement urgent restructuring to protect the viability of our Maltese base." 
The memo added that terminations would begin from June 30, with a one-month notice that will be paid in full. 
Approximately 20 pilots and 40 cabin crew will be made redundant, out of 179 pilots and cabin crew based on the 
island. A Malta Air spokesman said: "Due to COVID-19 we are facing a drop in traffic this year of up to 50%. We are 
doing our utmost to save jobs. We have agreed pay cuts with our pilots, which will be sufficient to avoid job losses, 
but our cabin crew have to date failed to accept our pay proposals, which means job losses of up to 40 cabin crew 
are now unavoidable."

Jun 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate 
ReleaseChicago, IL - June 3, 2020 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day 
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. 
Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Wingstop Inc. WING[1], Papa John's International, Inc. 
PZZA[2], Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[3], Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI[4] and Civeo Corporation CVEO[5].Here 
are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog: 5 Stocks with Decent Growth Potential to Watch AheadU.S. markets 
have gathered steam over the past couple of weeks, thanks to the country's economy which is slowly coming back 
on track. As lockdown measures are being lifted across the country and people are venturing out to their favorite 
stores and restaurants or making travel plans, various parts of the economy are witnessing more activity.This is why 
now could be the ideal time to add stocks with good growth potential to one's watch list.Markets Significantly Up 
Since March LowsU.S. stocks have come a long way from their lowest points on Mar 23. The three major indexes, 
the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&#38;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have gained more than 30% since 
then. Specifically, the Dow Jones, the S&#38;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have added 32.9%, 32.6% and 
37.9%, respectively, since Mar 23.Of course, several factors have aided this impressive growth in a little more than 
two months. Two rate cuts by the central bank in March (once by 0.50% and the second time by 1%) undoubtedly 
helped industries (current rates are between 0% and 0.25%) along with about $2.3 trillion in several measures that 
comprise loans to help small- and medium-sized businesses. The government's $3 trillion in coronavirus relief 
packages to aid states, local governments and American taxpayers assisted the markets as well.In fact, last week, 
the Dow Jones crossed 25,000 points for the first time since March, boosted by optimism over a reviving economy 
as all 50 states are reopening centers of business. As of Jun 1, the index remains well above 25,000 points, having 
closed at 25,475.02 at the end of Monday's trading session. In addition, the S&#38;P 500 crossed the 3,000 mark 
for the first time since Mar 5 on May 26.Which Industries Could Gain Ahead and Why?Keeping in mind the 
substantial gains the three indexes have raked in since March, one could take a look at the factors that have 
propelled equities so far and may continue to do so ahead. In addition, delving deeper into the industries that are 
now well positioned for encouraging movement ahead is prudent.First, as business hubs, offices, restaurants, 
hotels and other public places reopen around the country, consumer activity is gathering steam again. This is why 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Wingstop , Papa John's International, Ryanair , Darden Restaurants and 
Civeo
businesses such as airlines, hotels, restaurants, retailers of apparel, shoes and other discretionary items that were 
hit hard during the pandemic are expected to gain momentum.Although many restrictions remain in place, 
consumers are getting back to their routines pre lockdown and are visiting restaurants, and making plans to travel 
and buy new property.Per a CNBC report, data from online reservation platform Open Table revealed that 
restaurant bookings declined as much as 100% in the last weeks of March and most of April as compared to 2019. 
However, as states allowed restaurants to reopen dining instead of just rely on takeout, delivery and curbside 
pickup, bookings in restaurants started picking up toward May-end again, indicating a revival of the food service 
industry.Second, the hotel and travel industries are regaining their lost glory too, as the occupancy rate for U.S. 
hotels is inching higher. Occupancy rates in April and May began to rise as travelers headed back to executing their 
travel plans. According to Statista, occupancy in hotels across Americas was 23.5% in April. However, in the week 
ending May 23, hotels across the United States had occupancy of 35.4%.Finally, according to data by 
Transportation Security Administration, total number of travelers rose to 352,947 on May 31 from 87,534 on Apr 14. 
This indicates increasing activity on the front of airline bookings.5 Stocks to WatchKeeping the aforementioned 
factors in mind, we have, rounded up five stocks from the select industries that have good potential for growth. All 
these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank

Jun 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With the coronavirus 
pandemic disrupting air-travel demand, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported a 99.5% 
year-over-year plunge in May traffic to merely 0.07 million guests. As wide-spread travel restrictions are still in 
place, the carrier's LaudaMotion unit in Austria did not carry any passenger during the month.This Zacks Rank #2 
(Buy) Irish carrier operated 701 scheduled flights in May including those for rescue operations, relief and medicine 
supply on behalf of various EU governments. Moreover, 99% of those flights arrived on time. 
On a rolling annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion unit) decreased 17% to 121 million. 
Load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) was 95% on a rolling annual basis. Due to travel bans and curbs, 
Ryanair expects its traffic numbers for June to be minimal too.To match this extremely low demand scenario, 
Ryanair trimmed its flight capacity significantly. Notably, it is not the only carrier to have slashed capacity due to the 
pandemic-borne crisis. U.S.-based carriers including American Airlines AAL[2] and United Airlines UAL[3], both 
currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), also suspended various flights in the wake of the coronavirus 
onslaught.The traffic report apart, Ryanair recently grabbed headlines for challengingthe government rescue 
package for the Zacks #3 Ranked German carrier Deutsche Lufthansa DLAKY[4]. This European low-cost airline 
fears that the huge state aid, which will be effective following the European Commission's approval, will tamper a 
healthy competition and deny a fair play to low-cost carriers like Ryanair.You can see the complete list of today's

Securities Fraud Lawsuit

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) must face a securities fraud lawsuit accusing it of defrauding shareholders by 
downplaying its willingness to recognize labor unions, Reuters reported Monday. 
US District Judge Paul Oetken dismissed much of the proposed class action, but said shareholders could try to 
prove that the Ireland-based budget carrier intended to mislead shareholders on its willingness to recognize labor 
unions, according to the report.
At Ryanair's September 2017 annual general meeting, CEO Michael O'Leary stated said that hell would "freeze 
over" before the carrier accepted unions. Later, O'Leary contradicted himself, saying he had "long anticipated" 
unionization. Such statements, the judge said, could prove possible intent to mislead shareholders, Reuters 
reported.
In December 2017, Ryanair offered to recognize pilot unions to prevent a pilots' strike, and its American depositary 
shares declined 5.2%. The lawsuit was filed in November 2018 by an Alabama fund, the City of Birmingham 
Firemen's and Policemen's Supplemental Pension System, on behalf of Ryanair ADS investors from May 30, 2017 
to Sept. 28, 2018.
Reuters was unable to obtain any comment from Ryanair, its lawyers, and lawyers for the lead plaintiff.

Ryanair Holdings Plc and Chief Executive Michael O'Leary failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a securities 
fraud lawsuit accusing Europe's largest budget airline of defrauding them by downplaying its willingness to 
recognize labor unions.
While dismissing much of the proposed class action, U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken said shareholders could try to 
prove that Ryanair intended to mislead them with statements indicating a "near certainty" it would not welcome 
unions, the recognition of which could increase costs and reduce profitability.
The Manhattan judge said this included O'Leary's statement at Ryanair's September 2017 annual general meeting 
that hell would "freeze over" before the Dublin-based carrier accepted unions.
Such statements "are impossible to reconcile with O'Leary's subsequent admission that he had 'long anticipated' 
unionization," and were "direct evidence" of possible intent to mislead shareholders, Oetken wrote.
Ryanair offered that December to recognize pilot unions, to avert a possible strike, and its American depositary 
shares fell 5.2% that day.
Oetken also dismissed claims concerning other statements about Ryanair's labor relations, profitability and growth 
targets, finding no proof the statements were false.
Ryanair and its law firm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the lead plaintiff did not 
immediately respond to similar requests.

The lawsuit was filed in November 2018 by an Alabama fund, the City of Birmingham Firemen's and Policemen's 
Supplemental Pension System, on behalf of Ryanair ADS investors from May 30, 2017 to Sept. 28, 2018.
Ryanair cited labor issues when it cut its full-year profit forecast on Oct. 1, 2018. Its share price closed that day 
more than one-third below its level in mid-March.
O'Leary has been Ryanair's chief executive since 1994.
The case is City of Birmingham Firemen's and Policemen's Supplemental Pension System v Ryanair Holdings Plc

Jun 02, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  France on 
Tuesday denounced as "blackmail" an ultimatum from low-cost carrier Ryanair for its French employees to choose 
between a five-year pay cut or a number of redundancies in an escalating labour dispute.The offer from the Dublin-
based no-frills carrier, long accused by critics of abrasive labour tactics, comes as the aviation industry grapples 
with an unprecedented crisis after the collapse in global demand for air travel due to the coronavirus."Blackmail is 
never an option," Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told RTL radio. "Jobs will be protected by imaginative solutions, 
but definitely not through blackmail," he said.The aviation industry is facing drastic losses due to the coronavirus 
pandemic, which has closed borders across the world and paralysed air transport.Ryanair has already announced 
plans to axe 3,000 pilot and cabin crew jobs, or 15 percent of staff across its European network.In France, Ryanair 
operates from hubs including the Marseille, Toulouse and Bordeaux airports.The Irish company has told French 
unions to accept plans to cut wages by 20 percent for pilots and 10 percent for stewards and air hostesses from 
July 2020, or face the redundancy of 23 pilots and 27 cabin crew staff. 
Ryanair told unions to choose: Pay cuts or job cuts Photo: AFP / GERARD JULIEN  Under current plans, staffers 
who are earning minimum wage would see their work time cut by 20 percent. Employees would progressively 
regain their salary up until 2025.Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud said she was "shocked" by Ryanair's proposal and 
said the company must go back to the drawing board and "really talk (with employees), but not blackmail."Since 
2017 companies can open up talks with its employees on contract hours and salaries in exchange of a company's 
commitment to suspend dismissals, Penicaud said on TV station BFM Business.But the spirit of this possibility is 
"not at all the one being used by Ryanair," she said.Ryanair benefited from the state scheme to help companies 
through the two-month lockdown period by placing staffers on partial unemployment, Penicaud said."We helped 
them and they're not playing the game," she added.The head of France's biggest trade union CFDT, Laurent 
Berger, said Ryanair wasn't showing respect to "its employees, nor workers, nor anyone."Berger called for a 
boycott of the airline. "Let's stop taking Ryanair to travel," he said, accusing the company of "pressuring its 
employees for years."

Ryanair logo Several analysts have recently updated their ratings and price targets for Ryanair (NASDAQ: 
RYAAY): 
•
5/26/2020 - Ryanair  was upgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a "strong sell" rating 
to a "buy" rating. They now have a $68.00 price target on the stock. According to Zacks, "Travel demand 
woes due to coronavirus are weighing on Ryanair s operations. The carrier s fiscal 2020 profits were hurt 
by over  40 million due to coronavirus-led reduced demand. Moreover, traffic decreased by more than 5 
million in the period. Amid these adversities, the carrier expects to incur a loss of more than  200 million in 
first quarter fiscal 2021. Moreover, it expects to transport less than 80 million passengers during fiscal 
2021. Due to the coronavirus-related headwinds, shares of the company have declined more than 25% 
since the beginning of February. Persistent below-par performance of the Laudamotion unit is also 
concerning. Notably, the company&#39;s cost-cutting measures are impressive.Moreover, the airline s 
strong liquidity position is noteworthy."
•
5/21/2020 - Ryanair  was upgraded by analysts at BidaskClub from a "sell" rating to a "hold" rating.
•
5/20/2020 - Ryanair  had its "overweight" rating reaffirmed by analysts at Barclays PLC.

"overweight" rating.
•
4/7/2020 - Ryanair  was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a "hold" rating to a 
"strong sell" rating. They now have a $61.00 price target on the stock. According to Zacks, "Ryanair has 
been badly hit by the coronavirus outbreak as Italy, one of its main markets, has been affected 
significantly. Owing to the outbreak, shares of the company have declined 37.1% since the beginning of 
February. Due to the coronavirus-led reduced demand the company lowered its fiscal 2020 traffic forecast 
by 3 million to 151 million. Notably, Ryanair grounded majority of its flights effective Mar 24 and does not 
expect to operate any flight in April and May. Moreover, below-par performance of the Laudamotion unit is 
concerning. However, efforts to add shareholder value are a positive too. Ryanair returned more than  560 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) - Research Analysts' Recent Ratings Updates
million to its shareholders through this investor-friendly measure in fiscal 2019. Ryanair s efforts to expand 
its fleet size are encouraging as well. Moreover, its environment-friendly efforts are commendable."

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) is facing a securities fraud lawsuit after Chief Executive Michael O'Leary failed to 
convince a US judge to terminate the case, Reuters reported on Tuesday.
The class action brought on by shareholders alleges the airline company of fraud by understating its readiness to 
recognize labor unions.
US District Judge Paul Oetken said that the shareholders could prove that Ryanair Holdings misled them with 
phrases like hell would "freeze over" before it allowed unions.
Oetken also discounted claims about the company's labor relations, profitability and growth targets following lack of 
evidence.
The company's shares increased about 2% on Tuesday morning.

Jun 02, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With passenger 
revenues declining due to the coronavirus-triggered bearish air-travel demand, Delta Air Lines DAL[1] is focusing on 
its cargo-only flights. To this end, the carrier decided to operate daily flights connecting Seoul-Incheon with Detroit. 
Moreover, cargo-special flights will operate four-times a week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday) on the 
Incheon-Los Angeles route and thrice a week (Monday, Thursday, Saturday) connecting Incheon and Atlanta.The 
decision is aimed at keeping the supply chain of medical equipment like surgical masks, gloves, gowns and other 
protective gear operative between the United States and Asia. 
While Delta will use its Boeing 777-200ER aircraft to operate the Atlanta and Los Angeles flights, Airbus A350-900 
aircraft will ply on the Incheon-Detroit routes for carrying cargo.Both jets have the capacity to carry up to 42 tons of 
cargo on international routes. Per the schedule, the cargo on arrival in Atlanta, Detroit or Los Angeles will be 
transferred to domestic passenger flights so that they can be shipped to other destinations in the country.Further 
deepening its focus on cargo-only flights, Delta launched its Cargo Control Center in Atlanta to support global cargo 
services on a daily basis. This new facility will address all aspects of cargo transportation and management, which 
in turn, will ease the tracking of air shipments, trucks, mail and freight, both domestically and internationally.With 
passenger demand plummeting, the cargo-only operations might help Delta recoup a bit of its lost revenues.Zacks 
Rank &#38; Key PicksDelta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks 
Transportation[2] sector are Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], Teekay Tankers Ltd. TNK[4] and Nordic American 
Tankers Ltd. NAT[5], each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here.[6] Ryanair has an impressive earnings history, having outperformed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 62.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate 
for Teekay Tanker's current-year earnings has been revised 35.6% upward in the past 60 days.The Zacks 
Consensus Estimate for Nordic American Tankers' current-year earnings has moved 14.1% north in the past 60 
days.5 Stocks to Soar Past the Pandemic: In addition to the companies you learned about above, we invite you to

Jun 02, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per Reuters[1], Delta Air 
Lines Inc DAL[2] is working with its pilots' union to avoid involuntary furloughs of more than 2,300 pilots.Over the 
weekend, the airline carried out a reshuffling process to align its staff size to flying plans for summer 2021. In a 
"surplus" bid, Delta asked employees to petition available positions at one of its U.S. pilot bases. Following the 
results, the carrier will transfer approximately 7,000 pilots to different locations or aircraft types, per Delta's Master 
Executive Council ('MEC') of the Air Line Pilots Association ('ALPA'). However, 2,327 pilots remained 
unassigned.Delta, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), stated that the bid is "to better align our staffing with our future 
flying demand." The carrier is "looking at all options to mitigate or minimize furloughs and will continue working with 
ALPA in the coming weeks to explore those options."Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price            
https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/DAL/price?icid=chart-DAL-fundamental/price Delta Air Lines, Inc. 
price[3] | Delta Air Lines, Inc. Quote[4] Last week, the airline furnished details of early-out options for non-union 
employees. Employees availing these options will be provided with cash severance, full healthcare coverage and 
travel benefits.The airlines' need to reduce workforce to match the current demand scenario has become 
pronounced lately. Last week, United Airlines Holdings UAL[5] revealed plans to cut 13 officer jobs as part of its 
cost-cutting measures to deal with the coronavirus-led slump in air travel demand. Earlier, American Airlines Group 
AAL[6] notified that it would cut jobs in the management and support staff team by 30%.Both United Airlines and 
American Airlines carry a Zacks Rank #3.A Key PickA better-ranked stock in the same space is Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[7] carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)

D uring the coronavirus crisis, democratic governments have discovered - again - that businesses act in their own 
interest, not in the interests of the country where they happen to be based.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary wants to relaunch 40 per cent of flights in July, whether or not it suits 
Ireland, the UK or any other government. Coffee chains closed during Britain's lockdown, despite the government 
encouraging cafés to stay open for takeaways. The issue predates the pandemic: UK entrepreneur James Dyson, a 
vocal supporter of Brexit Britain's economic potential, has moved his company's headquarters to Singapore. All this 
suggests that nationalities matter less than they once did. When McDonald's opened its first restaurant in Moscow 
30 years ago, it was seen as a symbol of US victory over the Soviet Union. McDonald's remains a quintessentially 
American company, but today its leadership includes executives from Poland and the UK. The chain was until 
recently led by another Briton.
The picture is the same in most companies that operate globally. Executives hail from a wide range of countries, 
have lived in more countries still and consider themselves international creatures. In 2018, only about half of FTSE 
100 CEOs were British; the rest hailed from 20 other countries. The trend extends beyond the UK. Indra Nooyi, 
former chief executive of PepsiCo, was born in India. Rajeev Suri, who runs Nokia of Finland, is Singaporean.
Stefano Pessina, an Italian, is chief executive of Anglo-American drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance.

home country of Sweden, is now owned by Geely of China. That's how globalisation works. And, until now, it has 
Companies should start showing more national loyalty
largely worked well. Governments have not insisted that companies act in the national interest, despite complaints 
about tax avoidance and offshoring. As long as they create jobs, they have been allowed to go on their merry 
commercial way without consideration for obligations to their home countries. Unsurprisingly, during Covid-19 and 
other recent crises, many companies have not prioritised the interests of their home countries. Governments 
certainly can't expect businesses to act out of patriotism. In a world of increasing foreign ownership and overseas 
operations, to which country should a company show allegiance? If we have learnt anything during this crisis, it is 
that governments would achieve a lot more with some goodwill from businesses. Amazon, which has prospered 
during the pandemic, could enhance conditions for its workers. Ryanair could accept governmental pleas for empty 
middle seats. By contrast, during the cold war, the Swedish government made clear that it expected Volvo and 
other market pillars to do their part for the nation during a crisis. It designated them "K Companies", involved them 
in war planning and underwrote their preparedness efforts. For the past several years, the Pentagon, the US 
Department of Energy and other American government departments have held regular meetings with senior 
executives to inform them about national security threats.
Such initiatives could be expanded.
To be sure, no business leader likes commitments to causes that don't generate revenues, and many companies 
are torn between their home base and their foreign owners. But the alternative would see countries further 
weakened during future crises. Liberal democracies face an unpalatable combination of threats from mother nature 
and hostile states.
Such deterioration is in no one's interest. Governments could, of course, simply nationalise vital businesses. After 
all, a government-run coffee chain or airline would have to obey the rules around opening. Business leaders, unite! 
For national wellbeing, that is.

D uring the coronavirus crisis, democratic governments have discovered - again - that businesses act in their own 
interest, not in the interests of the country where they happen to be based.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary wants to relaunch 40 per cent of flights in July, whether or not it suits 
Ireland, the UK or any other government. Coffee chains closed during Britain's lockdown, despite the government 
encouraging cafés to stay open for takeaways. The issue predates the pandemic: UK entrepreneur James Dyson, a 
vocal supporter of Brexit Britain's economic potential, has moved his company's headquarters to Singapore. All this 
suggests that nationalities matter less than they once did. When McDonald's opened its first restaurant in Moscow 
30 years ago, it was seen as a symbol of US victory over the Soviet Union. McDonald's remains a quintessentially 
American company, but today its leadership includes executives from Poland and the UK. The chain was until 
recently led by another Briton.
The picture is the same in most companies that operate globally. Executives hail from a wide range of countries, 
have lived in more countries still and consider themselves international creatures. In 2018, only about half of FTSE 
100 CEOs were British; the rest hailed from 20 other countries. The trend extends beyond the UK. Indra Nooyi, 
former chief executive of PepsiCo, was born in India. Rajeev Suri, who runs Nokia of Finland, is Singaporean.
Stefano Pessina, an Italian, is chief executive of Anglo-American drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance.
Companies have gone transnational along with their top executives: Volvo Cars, once closely identified with its 
home country of Sweden, is now owned by Geely of China. That's how globalisation works. And, until now, it has 
Companies should start showing more national loyalty
largely worked well. Governments have not insisted that companies act in the national interest, despite complaints 
about tax avoidance and offshoring. As long as they create jobs, they have been allowed to go on their merry 
commercial way without consideration for obligations to their home countries. Unsurprisingly, during Covid-19 and 
other recent crises, many companies have not prioritised the interests of their home countries. Governments 
certainly can't expect businesses to act out of patriotism. In a world of increasing foreign ownership and overseas 
operations, to which country should a company show allegiance? If we have learnt anything during this crisis, it is 
that governments would achieve a lot more with some goodwill from businesses. Amazon, which has prospered 
during the pandemic, could enhance conditions for its workers. Ryanair could accept governmental pleas for empty

Jun 01, 2020( ReleaseWire: http://www.releasewire.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; Los Angeles, CA -- (SBWIRE[1]) 
-- 06/01/2020 -- It has been more than two months since the majority of businesses have been shut down. The 
hotel, restaurant and tourism sectors are the most strongly impacted by this major economic crisis. Companies 
such as Ryanair, Rolls Royce, Renault, Uber or AirBnB have had to resort to mass redundancies. Hertz in the 
United States and Canada has made tens of thousands of employees redundant. 
In the United States, the unemployment rate jumped to 14.7% in April and could reach 20% very quickly. As a 
reminder, it was 3.6% at the end of 2019! It should be remembered that in 1929 unemployment was half of what it is 
today. The scale of this disaster is global.An economic crisis that does not spare politicsIn the face of this 
unprecedented crisis, public authorities have had to take unprecedented measures. Never before had there been 
any question of forcing a population to remain confined, of limiting travel to a radius of 100 km from its home, or 
even having to produce an exit permit. All these measures have radically changed our way of life. The political 
authorities took these strong measures to limit the circulation of the virus and the number of deaths caused by this 
pandemic. But in the minds of many French people, they have been discriminatory, illogical and some even feel that 
they came too late. From then on, criticism began to erupt: the political leaders did not manage the fight against the 
epidemic well!More inequality and authoritarianismBorder closures, containment, quarantine, the pandemic gave an 
excuse to those who wanted to implement increased protectionism. The free movement of goods was hampered, 
with the result that citizens became increasingly afraid of running out of essentials. Fear that provoked shocking 
images of confrontations in supermarkets or hoarding of basic necessities. It should also be noted that the 
executive power of our countries has relied on the recommendations of a Scientific Council, composed of 
personalities specialised in epidemiology. For the first time in modern history, the well-being of the population has, 
for the first time, exceeded economic interest.Chronicle of a recession foretoldTo those who still believe that once 
the summer is over, everything will return to normal, it must be said: you are mistaken. Until a vaccine is found, until 
the virus can mutate to produce a new strain every year, no one is safe from Covid-19. Therefore, a return to 
normal - if at all - cannot be objectively envisaged for several months or even years. In the meantime, we are going 
to have to learn to live differently, to live together differently, to consume differently, to work differently; for what is 
most likely awaiting us is a long recession, worse than the one the world experienced after the stock market crisis of 
1929.When will the politician take responsibility?While the first mass redundancies have started, all over the world 
policies cannot change this, only populists and extremists can benefit from them.It is the impression of the immense 
majority, that it is in the mahogany henhouses praised by Alain Souchon (a nod to the author of Foule 
Economic Crisis: COVID-19 Pandemic Will Have Greater Impact Than the Stock Market Crash of 1929
sentimentale), that we only see headless fowls running in all directions, straight to their rout. Politics has no place, 
the crisis is neither left-wing nor right-wing, it has no political affiliation. The upheaval that countries are 
experiencing can only be resolved with a European, if not international, consensus and revolutionary measures 
such as the New Deal and the Marshall Plan used during the major financial crises. Partisan agitation can only 
benefit extremists and populists who have no effective alternative but to take advantage of this misfortune. In fact, 
we are seeing the emergence of media figures who have no skills or ideas to deal with this problem. It is as long as 
politicians understand this and move away from the siren song of all sides that is of no interest to the citizens.A sign 
of hope in the fogIf the world is on the verge of an even more dramatic depression than that of the 1930s, we must 
nevertheless remain hopeful. Containment will certainly have positive sides: it will have brought us closer together. 
It will have taught us to work differently. It will have taught us to cherish what is essential: our lives are not only 
destined to play an economic role in society. This pandemic has also made us aware that it is in fact essential to be 
independent in several areas, in particular: the plan for the manufacture of medicines, spare parts and the 
management of the stock of masks. This crisis could enable States that have learned the lesson to make more 
intelligent investments that could allow a certain degree of self-sufficiency in the essential elements of health, 
medicines and all the products essential to a country's life. More wisdom, the crisis also obliges us to make more 
reforms: a reform of the system, a wide-ranging tax reform, a waiver of the debts of the poorest countries and a 
reduction in the debts of citizens.We are not safe from the next virus or a major climate crisis. These drastic 
measures are essential if we are to be ready this time. I'll tell you what...Thierry Rayer president of The Cercle

Jun 01, 2020( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com Delivered by Newstex)  Coronavirus lockdowns have taken a 
heavy toll on the financial performance and stability of global airlines and their suppliers.According to aviation 
tracking site FlightRadar, the number of global passenger flights has fallen 77% since January 2020, and the US 
Transportation Security Administration reported a 96% drop in US traveler screenings compared to 2019 
figures.Meanwhile, the ARCA Global Airline stock market index, which tracks global airline shares, shed just under 
60% of its value this year.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts a US$252 billion fall in ticket 
revenues if travel bans remain in place for three months.The rapid decline in passenger traffic and revenues has 
forced airlines around the world to announce large-scale layoffs. Qantas has put 20,000 staff on leave and 700 
pilots at American Airlines have taken early retirement.Airline financing structures have also come under strain. 
EasyJet, Ryanair, Lufthansa, IAG, Air Baltic and Turkish Airlines are just some of the operators that have had credit 
ratings downgraded and placed on watchlists. 
Some high profile airlines, such as Virgin Australia, have already been pushed into administration as a result. 
Avianca and LATAM also recently filed for Chapter 11 protection. All eyes will be on these cases as they may set 
the tone for how leases may be renegotiated in future Chapter 11 cases, and give us an understanding of which 
aircraft will be abandoned/rejected.The financial impact on airlines has rippled down the supply chain. Aircraft and 
engine manufacturers are preparing to cut thousands of jobs. Aircraft leasing companies, which own around half of 
the world's passenger fleet, have also been squeezed. Lessors have been approached by airlines asking for rent 
deferrals and restructurings but have little room to play hardball as there are currently no other options for 
redeploying aircraft.Chapter 11 and administrations could be on the horizon for lessors without the backing of 
significant equity buffers. Cash-rich players, however, will be well-placed to win market share and buy up distressed 
rivals when lockdowns ease[1]. Focusing on cash In the face of these operational and financial challenges, aviation 
companies have been considering all available lending options to bulk out their cash balances.Government-backed 
loan programs, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the US and the UK 
Treasury's coronavirus fund, have been the first port of call. Larger airlines with the resources to navigate and apply 
for the programs have moved quickly to secure funds. EasyJet secured a 600 million (US$744.4 million) loan from

the UK's coronavirus fund, while American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Airlines will receive funds from the 
CARES Act, according to a recent report by Xtract Research.To date, American Airlines will take a direct grant of 
US$4.1 billion and a low-interest loan of US$1.7 billion from, and issue warrants to, the US government. Delta will 
receive a US$5.4 billion package made up of low interest loans and warrants. Exploring all options State-backed 
export credit agencies (ECAs) have always supported aerospace manufacturers and provided low-interest loans to 
airlines. The Export-Import Bank of the United States, for example, has historically supported aerospace 
manufacturers and airlines with low interest rate loans, while Norway's credit agency Giek has opened a US$522 
million scheme to guarantee loans made to the country's airlines. We will likely see better credits take advantage of 
ECA support if they can't achieve attractive cost of funds in the market.For some airlines, the reopening of the high 
yield bond markets after a sharp decline in Q1 2020 has also provided an opportunity to raise finance. High yield 
bonds have not been options for all airlines but, at the end of April, Delta Airlines came to market seeking US$3 
billion, split between a five-year senior secured note and three-year term loan B. The company is also expected to 
benefit from a Federal Reserve commitment to continue buying the bonds of previously investment grade issuers 
that have been downgraded as a direct result of the pandemic.But while there appears to be some interest in the 
high yield bond market for airline bonds, not all airlines have enjoyed success, as investors remain cautious and 
demanding. United Airlines, for example, cancelled its US$2.25 billion bond offer after failing to settle on terms with 
lenders. The airline had already upped the price of its bonds to 11% to secure investor support, but decided against 
proceeding with the bond issue.A sticking point was said to be the valuation attributed to United's fleet, which was 
to be used to secure the bonds. This theme is likely to characterize any loan negotiations in the aviation industry in 
the coming months. Appraising the value of aviation assets will remain challenging until it's clear when airlines can 
resume operations at scale. This will lead to a pricing tug-of-war between borrowers holding out for a swift recovery 
and more skeptical lenders.Pricing stasis in bond markets will see aviation businesses lean on their relationship 
lenders and explore other options, such as sale-and-leaseback financing. United, for example, agreed a loan deal 
of undisclosed value to sell and leaseback 22 planes to BOC Aviation. Sale-and-leaseback arrangements could 
secure significant sums of liquidity for airlines that have above average levels of fleet ownership. Turbulence ahead 
All aviation companies, including those that have been able to bring on additional liquidity, however, face a period of 
prolonged uncertainty that will continue to color lending in the sector for some time.Even when travel restrictions are 
lifted, it could be some time before passengers feel confident enough to resume travelling en masse, and there are 
questions around whether corporate travel will rebound to pre-pandemic levels as businesses have become more 
comfortable using video conferencing tools during the pandemic.The post-COVID-19 aviation industry will likely be 
materially transformed, which in turn will influence the financing options available to airlines. The next few months 
will be decisive for the future of the sector.[View source[2].] [ 1]: https://mergers.whitecase.com/highlights/aviation-

Rolls-Royce has tapped the UK government's Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) for £300 million ($373 
million).
The information was revealed as part of a data disclosure by the Bank of England, which manages the facility.
Rolls-Royce did not respond to a request for comment from Airfinance Journal regarding the facility.
As of 3 June, British Airways had raised £300 million, Easyjet £600 million, Ryanair £600 million and Wizz £300 
million via the CCFF, the Bank of England said.
In May, Jet2 owner Dart Group also said it would be drawing £300 million under the facility.
Rolls-Royce said in April that it had fully drawn down its £2.5 billion revolving credit facility (RCF). This, together 
with securing an additional RCF and other resources, gave the manufacturer liquidity of £6.7 billion at the time, it 
said.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/quarantine-will-destroy-travel-firms-putting-thousands-of-jobs-at-risk/The 
quarantine about to be imposed on arrivals to Britain will 'kill' the travel industry and have the same impact as the 
complete closure of the nation's borders, ministers have been warned.Aviation leaders urged the government 
yesterday to rethink the plan, saying it was the equivalent of hanging up a 'Britain is closed' sign. They warned that 
it would damage the economic recovery at a crucial time and cost thousands of jobs in the travel, tourism and 
hospitality industries. 
They were joined in their opposition by tourism bodies and politicians. From June 8, all travellers to Britain, 
including Britons returning home[1], will be forced to spend two weeks isolating at a single address even if they 
have come from countries with few coronavirus infections. Arrivals will have to reveal where they will be staying and 
anyone not complying faces a fine of up to 1,000. Amid the backlash against the plan, research by the International 
Air Transport Association (Iata) showed that Britons were 'relatively keen to travel again'. It found that 48 per cent of 
people in the UK would be willing to travel within a 'month or two' of the threat posed by Covid-19 being controlled. 
This was above the international average and higher than the US, Japan, Germany, Canada and Australia. 
However, Iata said that the quarantine would destroy any attempt to resume international travel into or from Britain. 
Simon McNamara, of the trade group, said: 'As the concern about Covid-19 recedes, if the quarantine is still in 
place people are not going to travel. It is not a question of being prepared to go through quarantine because they 
want to travel. All the evidence we have is that this will just kill travel. Governments seem to have a stark choice. 
They cannot pretend that quarantine enables their international travel markets to open up, because the evidence is 
quite simply not there. If they persist with quarantine it is effectively the same as locking down your country.' In 
contrast Italy is rolling out the red carpet for foreign visitors to try to rebuild its economy. On Wednesday a rule 
requiring new arrivals to self-isolate for two weeks will be scrapped for visitors from Europe, including Britain. On 
quarantine, the Iata intervention adds to the voices calling on ministers to ditch the idea. The head of British 
Airways has already criticised the plan, and Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, described it over the 
weekend as 'a complete shambles' and unenforceable. Tim Alderslade, of Airlines UK, which represents British 
carriers, said yesterday: 'The quarantine will destroy jobs and put back the recovery at the exact time that other 
countries are opening up their borders. It is just about the worst thing they could do if the aim is to restart the 
economy and get aviation and tourism moving again.' Brian Strutton, of Balpa, the pilots' union, added: 'It's like 
Quarantine will destroy travel firms putting thousands of jobs at risk
hanging up a 'Britain is closed' sign and the whole economy will lose out as a result, not only delaying recovery from 
the coronavirus crisis but also putting at risk our preparedness for full Brexit at the end of this year.' Analysis of 12 
countries compared those that had already imposed a two-week quarantine and nations that had banned inward 
travel this month. It found no difference in bookings to travel to the countries, irrespective of the measure, 
suggesting that quarantine had the same impact as a complete ban. Iata has called instead for safe-flying 
measures, including temperature screening at airports and the mandatory wearing of facemasks on all flights. About 
50 Tory backbenchers are against the plan. The former Brexit secretary David Davis said: 'The government should 
be looking for the maximum level of relaxation [of border restrictions] consistent with safety. That means a lot of air 
bridges [reciprocal arrangements between countries] and where there aren't air bridges, the option for tests and 
inspections to eliminate the quarantine or limit it.' The Home Office has defended the plan, saying that decisions 
have 'got to be led by the science'. Some countries have shut their borders to Britons. Spain joined Greece 
yesterday in excluding British tourists from a list of countries allowed to enter when restrictions are lifted, because of 
the UK's high infection rate. Read more: Quarantine will destroy travel firms putting thousands of jobs at risk[2] [ 1]:

Jun 01, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Germany's flag carrier Lufthansa 
agreed Saturday to a €9 billion[1] coronavirus rescue plan from Berlin. The government on Monday announced the 
aid package that aims to keep the airliner going through the coronavirus crisis. The European Union however, said 
that, as a condition, bailouts must include measures that would maintain a level playing field for other companies. 
Lufthansa said in a statement it had agreed to the compromise worked out between Germany and the EU. Under 
the new rules, the airline will have to remove up to four aircraft from Munich and Frankfurt airports, to allow 
competitors to take the slots. The slots will be re-allocated through a bid process. Ryanair and easyJet are both 
thought to be interested. The bailout deal will also include the German government taking a 20% stake in the airline 
group, making it its biggest shareholder. As countries banned international travel in March, Lufthansa grounded[2] 
around 700 aircraft of its 763-unit fleet and reduced[3] its passenger capacity by 95%. [ 1]:

Jun 01, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per Reuters[1], United 
Airlines Holdings UAL[2] plans to cut 13 officer jobs as part of its cost-cutting measures to deal with the 
coronavirus-led slump in air travel demand.The 13 officer positions will be eliminated effective Jun 15. Eight of 
those removed will continue to be attached with the company through Sep 30. Due to the low-demand environment 
and the need to operate a smaller airline, United Airlines had warned of a 30% reduction in its administrative staff in 
October. To avoid furloughs, the carrier is launching programs for employees to accept voluntary leave or early 
retirement. The company has offered several of its flight attendants with voluntary separation packages.With a 
foresight to operate a smaller airline, last week American Airlines Group AAL[3], carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), 
revealed plans to cut jobs in the management and support staff team by 30%, to cut costs and match the current

Haneda, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Seoul. It will also boost capacity across Latin America and the Caribbean. 
United Airlines' July capacity is expected to be approximately 75% below normal. This represents an improvement 
over its current schedule, which is 90% below usual capacity.Last month, Delta Air Lines DAL[6] CEO Edward 
Bastian stated that he hopes to add around 200 flights in June and another 200 or 300 flights in July, amid signs of

$10 billion bailout for Germany 's Lufthansa passes hurdle

BERLIN (AP) - German flagship airline Lufthansa agreed Saturday to a compromise worked out between the 
government and the European Union, overcoming a major hurdle toward final approval of a 9 billion-euro ($10 
billion) bailout from Berlin.
Lufthansa said in a statement it had agreed to the compromise worked out between Germany and the EU in which 
the airline will have to give up several prized landing slots at Munich and Frankfurt airports. The dpa news agency 
reported the German government had also agreed to the compromise.
The government announced the aid package on Monday to help Lufthansa, which, like most airlines, has been 
struggling during the coronavirus pandemic.
The EU imposed conditions, however, saying that bailouts must include measures that would maintain a level 
playing field for other companies.
Specifics on the EU's demands weren't announced, but Lufthansa said the scope of commitments it agreed to had 
been reduced compared to initial plans, dpa reported.
Under the agreement, the airline must remove up to four aircraft from the two airports, equivalent to three daily 
take-off and three landing rights per aircraft, to allow competitors to take the slots, the airline said.
The slots will be re-allocated through a bid process. Discount airlines Ryanair and easyJet are both thought to be 
interested.
Lufthansa's supervisory board now needs to approve the full rescue package, including the conditions, and the 
German government needs to finalize its plans with the European Commission.

than €200 million in first quarter fiscal 2021. Moreover, it expects to transport less than 80 million passengers during 
fiscal 2021. Due to the coronavirus-related headwinds, shares of the company have declined more than 25% since 
the beginning of February. Persistent below-par performance of the Laudamotion unit is also concerning. Notably, 
the company's cost-cutting measures are impressive.Moreover, the airline's strong liquidity position is 
noteworthy."A number of other analysts have also recently issued reports on the stock. Barclays restated an

May 30, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Aircrafts of the German airline 
Lufthansa are parked at the airport in Munich, Germany, Tuesday, May 26, 2020. Germany on Monday approved a 
9 billion-euro ($9.8 billion) aid package for stricken airline Lufthansa to keep a major employer going through the 
turbulence of the coronavirus pandemic. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader)BERLIN (AP) — German flagship airline 
Lufthansa agreed Saturday to a compromise worked out between the government and the European Union, 
overcoming a major hurdle toward final approval of a 9 billion-euro ($10 billion) bailout from Berlin. Lufthansa said in 
a statement it had agreed to the compromise worked out between Germany and the EU in which the airline will 
have to give up several prized landing slots at Munich and Frankfurt airports. 
The dpa news agency reported the German government had also agreed to the compromise.  The government 
announced the aid package on Monday to help Lufthansa, which, like most airlines, has been struggling during the 
coronavirus pandemic.  The EU imposed conditions, however, saying that bailouts must include measures that 
would maintain a level playing field for other companies.  Specifics on the EU's demands weren't announced, but 
Lufthansa said the scope of commitments it agreed to had been reduced compared to initial plans, dpa reported. 
Under the agreement, the airline must remove up to four aircraft from the two airports, equivalent to three daily 
take-off and three landing rights per aircraft, to allow competitors to take the slots, the airline said.  The slots will be 
re-allocated through a bid process. Discount airlines Ryanair and easyJet are both thought to be interested.  
Lufthansa's supervisory board now needs to approve the full rescue package, including the conditions, and the 
German government needs to finalize its plans with the European Commission.8 5G Stocks to Own in 2020[1]To 
understand 5G is to understand that the 'G' stands for generation. Like the previous generations that came before it, 
5G promises to enhance the way consumers and businesses experience the internet. Yes, 5G will certainly deliver 
faster connection speeds. But I wouldn't be nearly as excited about this technology if it simply meant I could 
download a movie in seconds instead of minutes. Where 5G offers the most intriguing benefit is in the way it 
promises to enhance our increasingly connected future. Autonomous cars, industrial automation, augmented reality 
(AR) and virtual reality (VR) will all be transformed by the increased speed and reduced latency of a 5G network. 
One of the exciting aspects of 5G is the many ways investors can profit. There is an infrastructure being built to 
support the roll-out of this technology. It can't just use the existing cell phone towers. There are also chips that have 
to be created to support mobile devices. The 5G revolution will also benefit software providers. And then, of course, 
there are the wireless providers who will be introducing 5G phones and tablets sometime in 2020. Here's the rub. 
The build-out of a 5G infrastructure is behind schedule. And some industry experts are suggesting the real growth 
from 5G may not come until 2021. But there's no question that the infrastructure is being built now. And we've

EasyJet plans to reduce staff numbers by up to 30 per cent. The low-cost European carrier justifies the cuts by 
citing trade association forecasts that air travel will not return to normal until 2023. These forcasts are unduly 
pessimistic. The Spanish costas are reopening. Shares in travel groups are leaping. Ryanair and Wizz Air expect 
passenger volumes to recover some time next year.
EasyJet employees may be forgiven for wondering whether the business is snatching at a once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity to lower its cost base.
In fairness to Johan Lundgren, the job of chief executive is pretty horrible. Stalled demand and brief but credible 
fears of bankruptcy aside, he has had to deal with both a demanding shareholder and a big cyber attack.
One pre-pandemic constant was the complaint that easyJet's operating margins are a lot weaker than those of 
Ryanair. The figure for the last full financial year was 7.3 per cent compared to 13.3 per cent for the Irish airline, 
according to S&P Global. Futile to insist that easyJet flies to pricier airports. Investors are fond of invidious 
comparisons and the pairs trades that these inspire.
Average pay at easyJet is some £32,000 a year, according to the PayScale website. So shedding 4,500 jobs could 
save around £140m annually, some 3 per cent of total costs. EasyJet's share price jumped by more than 4 per cent 
as shareholders applauded the reduction in overheads. That contributed to a three-day rally of around 32 per cent.
EasyJet has some £1.5bn of liquidity. It reckons it could raise more from selling and leasing back part of its fleet, up 
about a fifth from April's estimate to a range of £500m-£650m.
EasyJet : the sack race Twitter : @FTLex
This last number seems surprising given that it must be a lessors' market. Executives at easyJet disagree, claiming 
there is plenty of interest in their fleet. But that conflicts with their downbeat assessment of future passenger 
numbers. The inconsistency is troubling, albeit that Mr Lundgren concedes that full recovery could come before 
2023.
Never waste a crisis. EasyJet's cuts may help it weather a travel industry downturn, or boost profitability if demand 
bounces back quickly. Watch out for other corporations cutting headcounts. The time when this can be explained as 
pandemic crisis management may soon be over.

weekday flights to Southampton in the second half of June. easyJet will also commence up to four flights per week

throughout July and August. Meanwhile, Newcastle Airport also outlined various measures to support the return of

cleaning and hygiene regime throughout the facilities. In addition, the airport has restricted terminal access to only 
passengers and staff, and has made two metre social distancing mandatory wherever possible. All passengers and 
staff are required to wear facemasks within the terminal building. Newcastle International Airport chief executive 
Nick Jones said: "This has been a very challenging period for aviation so it is pleasing that we are now taking 
cautious and carefully planned steps forward. We will continue to work with the government, our airlines and other 
business partners to ensure our customers and employees are as safe as possible. "Aviation is critical to kick 
starting the economy so to have airlines ready to restore connectivity is positive news for both the Airport and the

EasyJet plans to cut up to 30 per cent of its 15,000-strong workforce as it becomes the latest airline to warn that the 
industry faces a slow recovery.
The carrier said it needed to axe about 4,500 jobs as it looked to reshape the business on the basis that passenger 
demand would not return to 2019 levels until 2023.
EasyJet laid out plans to fly about 30 per cent of its normal capacity across July, August and September, which 
means taking a more cautious approach than rivals Ryanair and Wizz Air.
Ryanair this month confirmed plans to resume flights in July at about 40 per cent of capacity, before ramping it up to 
about 60 to 70 per cent by September.
Wizz Air expects to run about 70 per cent of its flights in July and August, subject to an easing of travel restrictions. 
It has already started flying about 10 per cent of its capacity.
EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren acknowledged that some other carriers were more optimistic about 
recovery before 2023. "I think we have done it on a prudent and we believe on a conservative but still realistic 
basis. Truth of the matter, nobody knows. Nobody would be happier than ourselves if demand was picking up 
earlier."
EasyJet ready to axe 30% of jobs and shrink fleet Airlines ; View is more bearish than rivals, with full recovery 
not expected until 2023
The cuts come almost a month after British Airways said it would be axing up to 30 per cent of its 42,000-strong 
workforce, while Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic have said they will cut up to 15 per cent and about 30 per cent 
respectively.
As well as cutting staff, easyJet said it was looking at closing bases at airports. It said it would also reduce its fleet 
to about 302 planes by the end of 2021, which is 51 lower than what was anticipated before the pandemic. The 
airline, which has had to ground almost its entire fleet since the end of March, has already said it will restart a small 
number of flights on June 15, which will mostly involve flying domestic routes in the UK and France. EasyJet is in 
the middle of a battle with founder and biggest shareholder Stelios Haji-Ioannou over a multibillion-pound order for 
107 Airbus aircraft. The airline held a general meeting last week in response to Sir Stelios's call to remove four 
directors, and about 58 per cent of investors voted against each resolution. This week Andrew Findlay, chief 
financial officer, announced plans to leave the group a year from now, days after he survived Sir Stelios's attempt to 
oust him.
Yesterday Sir Stelios hit out at easyJet again and said it should stop paying Airbus money first by cancelling the 
order rather than cutting staff. Earlier this month he offered a multimillion-pound reward for "useful information" in 
his fight to stop the order.
Mr Lundgren said the group had sought to establish a constructive relationship with Sir Stelios after the general 
meeting last week. "The key thing was the vote was so clear, that there is no support whatsoever for the argument 
to terminate the Airbus contract. Therefore that needs to be considered decided and now one needs to move on."

May 29, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Spirit Airlines 
SAVE[1] have appreciated 28.4% in the past seven days, outperforming its industry'[2]s 10.8% increase.The price 
performance is no doubt very impressive in these coronavirus-ravaged times. Lets delve into the details to unearth 
the reasons for this outperformance. Spirit Airlines presented a rosy picture at an investor presentation. 
Management stated that its low-cost structure has enabled it to withstand the current coronavirus-led crisis. The 
average daily cash burn rate of $4 million is expected to improve in the second half of 2020. In a bid to preserve 
cash, the carrier reduced the current-year planned gross capital expenses by $235 million.To bolster its liquidity 
position, the carrier sealed a deal with the U.S. treasury Department for a payroll support of approximately $335 
million (of the total amount, grants worth $264 million are not required to be paid back while a $71-million fund is 
obtained in unsecured low-interest loan) under the CARES Act. Low fuel costs are also providing a cushion to the 
bottom line. Notably, average fuel cost per gallon declined 13.4% in the March quarter to $1.81.Moreover, Spirit 
Airlines gained traction from the recent positive vibes surrounding this sector, which has been hit hard by the 
coronavirus pandemic. Notably, booking trends have been improving. Moreover, there has been an uptick in air 
travel in the United States since the Memorial Day weekend.Data from Transportation Security Administratio[3]n 
(TSA) shows that 340,769 passengers went through TSA checkpoints on the Memorial Day. Although the figure 
represents an 86.4% plunge from the year-ago number, it indicates a more than 100% surge from the lows in April. 
Zacks Rank &#38; Key PicksSpirit Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the 
transportation[4] sector include Frontline Limited FRO[5], Scorpio Tankers ( STNG[6] and Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[7]. While Frontline and Scorpio Tankers sport a Zacks Rank #1, Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #2

May 29, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  American Airlines 
Group AAL[1] is planning to cut jobs in the management and support staff ('MSS') team by 30%, per a letter to 
employees from Elise Eberwein, the company's executive vice president of People and Global Engagement.The 
airline is opening a new voluntary early-out program for MSS team members to volunteer through Jun 10. In case 
there are not enough volunteers, the company will resort to involuntary layoffs. Those laid off will remain under 
payroll through Sep 30 and continue to receive full compensation as per guidelines of the CARES Act.The staff-
reduction move is part of the carrier's efforts to cut costs, the most significant being expenses incurred on 
compensations and benefits, as it prepares to operate a 'smaller airline for the foreseeable future,' thanks to 
coronavirus-led 
travel 
demand

price[2] | American Airlines Group Inc. Quote[3] As many as 39,000 American Airlines' employees have voluntarily 
applied for unpaid leave or early retirement. The airline in its part plans to operate roughly 100 fewer aircraft next 
summer.Apart from MSS staff reduction, the airline announced other cost-cutting measures, including suspension 
of the MSS merit program for 2020 and canceling an incentive plan.Once the MSS team is right sized, American 
Airlines, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects to evaluate employee reductions in its frontline team. Here too, 
the company plans to launch a voluntary leave and early out program (likely in June), before contemplating 
involuntary furloughs.The need to reduce workforce in order to operate a smaller airline matching the current 
demand scenario has also been felt by other U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines DAL[4] and United Airlines UAL[5]. 
Delta is offering voluntary early retirement options[6] and buyout packages to employees. United Airlines is planning 
a similar move. Additionally, the airline has given a heads up of a 30% reduction in its administrative staff.Both 
Delta and United Airlines carry a Zacks Rank #3.A Key PickA better-ranked stock in the same space is Ryanair 
Holdings RYAAY[7], carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank

EasyJet Axes Almost A Third Of Staff On Virus Fallout

May 28, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  British no-frills 
airline EasyJet said Thursday that it will axe up to 4,500 jobs, or almost a third of its workforce, as coronavirus 
ravages demand and grounds global air travel."We are planning to reduce the size of our fleet and to optimise the 
network and our bases. As a result, we anticipate reducing staff numbers by up to 30 percent across the business 
and we will continue to remove cost and non-critical expenditure at every level," said Chief Executive Johan 
Lundgren in a statement.The job cuts will impact up to 4,500 of the carrier's 15,000 staff, a spokesman told AFP. 
A consultation process will be launched in the coming days.The COVID-19 outbreak has devastated the global 
aviation sector, with passenger numbers slumping during lockdown measures as air travel demand 
evaporates.EasyJet follows competitors British Airways, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic, which have all slashed staff 
numbers to save costs."We realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult 
decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long-term," added 
Lundgren."We remain focused on doing what is right for the company and its long-term health and success, 
following the swift action we have taken over the last three months to meet the challenges of the virus." EasyJet 
had grounded its entire fleet at the end of March, and currently plans to resume to the skies in mid-June with a 
limited number of flights. Cutting costs 'at every level' Photo: AFP / Fabrice COFFRINI "Although we will restart 
flying on 15 June, we expect demand to build slowly, only returning to 2019 levels in about three years' time," 
added Lundgren."We want to ensure that we emerge from the pandemic an even more competitive business than 
before, so that EasyJet can thrive in the future."Travellers arriving in Britain will meanwhile face 14 days in 
quarantine from next month to prevent a second coronavirus outbreak.The pandemic has battered the air transport 
sector by all but grounding planes, resulting in layoffs, bankruptcies and rescue plans worldwide -- although 
Lufthansa is wavering over a nine-billion-euro ($9.9 billion) German state lifeline.The International Air Transport 
Association (IATA) forecast this week that global airlines will lose some $314 billion (286 billion euros) in 2020 
revenues on the back of coronavirus.EasyJet added Thursday that it would not provide any outlook as a result of 
the turmoil."At this stage, given the level of continued uncertainty, it is not possible to provide financial guidance for 
the remainder of the 2020 financial year."However, as shown in this release, we continue to take every step 
necessary to reduce cost, conserve cash burn, enhance liquidity, protect the business and ensure it is best 
positioned on our return to flying."

POINTSEasyJetwarned that demand is unlikely to be restored to pre-pandemic levels until 2023Unite unionsaid the 
carrier made "an unnecessarily hasty decision.'British government will impose a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals 
from abroad, beginning June 8 Another British airliner has enacted significant layoffs[1] in response to the collapse 
of air travel demand due to the covid-19 pandemic.Budget carrier EasyJet said on Thursday it will slash up to 30% 
of its workforce, or an estimated 4,500 jobs based on the number of total employees at the beginning of 
2020.Luton-based Easyjet, which has major operations in both Luton and Gatwick (London) airports, also said it will 
resume flights on June 15 -- initially domestic routes in the U.K. and France. But the carrier - which grounded its 
entire fleet in March - warned that demand is unlikely to be restored to pre-pandemic levels until 2023.By the fourth 
quarter of this year, EasyJet said[2] expects to fly about 30% of capacity. By the end of its fiscal 2021 the airline will 
have a fleet of about 302 aircraft, or 51 fewer than what was expected prior to the pandemic.British Airways, 
Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic have already announced thousands of job cuts."To effect the restructure of our 
business, EasyJet will shortly launch an employee consultation process on proposals to reduce staff numbers by up 
to 30%, reflecting the reduced fleet, the optimization of our network and bases, improved productivity as well as the 
promotion of more efficient ways of working," the company said.EasyJet's chief executive Johan Lundgren stated: 
"We realize that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact 
our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long-term. 
We want to ensure that we emerge from the pandemic an even more competitive business than before, so that 
EasyJet can thrive in the future." Unions condemned the latest round of job cuts.Lindsey Olliver, the EasyJet officer 
for the Unite union, said the carrier made "an unnecessarily hasty decision.'"The workforce is currently furloughed 
under the government's job retention scheme and the airline will continue to receive support until at least October,' 
she said. "It has also received a government-backed loan of 600 million [$738 million] and has committed to 
expenditure on new aircraft."The British Airline Pilots' Association, or BALPA, trade union also criticized 
EasyJet.'EasyJet staff will be shocked at the scale of this announcement and only [two] days ago staff got a 'good 
news' message from their boss with no mention of job losses, so this is a real kick in the teeth,' said BALPA 
General Secretary, Brian Strutton[3]. 'Those staff have taken pay cuts to keep the airline afloat and this is the 
treatment they get in return Given EasyJet is a British company, the U.K. is its strongest market and it has had 
hundreds of millions [of pounds] in support from the U.K. taxpayer, I can safely say that we will need a lot of 
convincing that EasyJet needs to make such dramatic cuts. Indeed, EasyJet's own projections, though on the 
EasyJet Plans To Slash 30% Of Workforce, Reduce Fleet, Expects Low Demand Until 2023

EasyJet Axes Almost A Third Of Staff On Virus Fallout

May 28, 2020( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  British 
no-frills airline EasyJet said Thursday that it will axe up to 4,500 jobs, or almost a third of its workforce, as 
coronavirus ravages demand and grounds global air travel. "We are planning to reduce the size of our fleet and to 
optimise the network and our bases. 
As a result, we anticipate reducing staff numbers by up to 30 percent across the business and we will continue to 
remove cost and non-critical expenditure at every level," said Chief Executive Johan Lundgren in a statement. The 
job cuts will impact up to 4,500 of the carrier's 15,000 staff, a spokesman told AFP. A consultation process will be 
launched in the coming days. The COVID-19 outbreak has devastated the global aviation sector, with passenger 
numbers slumping during lockdown measures as air travel demand evaporates. EasyJet follows competitors British 
Airways, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic, which have all slashed staff numbers to save costs. "We realise that these are 
very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want 
to protect as many jobs as we can for the long-term," added Lundgren.  "We remain focused on doing what is right 
for the company and its long-term health and success, following the swift action we have taken over the last three 
months to meet the challenges of the virus." EasyJet had grounded its entire fleet at the end of March, and currently 
plans to resume to the skies in mid-June with a limited number of flights."Although we will restart flying on 15 June, 
we expect demand to build slowly, only returning to 2019 levels in about three years' time," added Lundgren. "We 
want to ensure that we emerge from the pandemic an even more competitive business than before, so that EasyJet 
can thrive in the future." Travellers arriving in Britain will meanwhile face 14 days in quarantine from next month to 
prevent a second coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic has battered the air transport sector by all but grounding 
planes, resulting in layoffs, bankruptcies and rescue plans worldwide -- although Lufthansa is wavering over a nine-
billion-euro ($9.9 billion) German state lifeline. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast this week 
that global airlines will lose some $314 billion (286 billion euros) in 2020 revenues on the back of coronavirus. 
EasyJet added Thursday that it would not provide any outlook as a result of the turmoil. "At this stage, given the 
level of continued uncertainty, it is not possible to provide financial guidance for the remainder of the 2020 financial 
year. "However, as shown in this release, we continue to take every step necessary to reduce cost, conserve cash 
burn, enhance liquidity, protect the business and ensure it is best positioned on our return to flying."

Lufthansa's supervisory board refused to approve a (EURO)9bn bailout proposed by Berlin after the European 
Commission sought to force the airline to give up slots at Frankfurt and Munich . After a meeting yesterday, the 
group said it would put off calling the extraordinary meeting required to get shareholders' approval for the deal, 
even as it burns through (EURO)1m an hour with most of its planes grounded.
The EU competition authority's demands, the supervisory board said, "would lead to a weakening of the hub 
function at Lufthansa's home airports", and the resulting economic impact had to be "analysed intensively".
But it saw the bailout from Berlin as "the only viable alternative for maintaining solvency".
The group, which includes the Austrian, Brussels, Swiss and Eurowings airlines, has been seeking aid in four 
European countries after its operations were reduced to just 1 per cent of normal .
After securing (EURO)1.4bn from Switzerland last month, Lufthansa reached a deal with its home government on 
Monday. Angela Merkel's administration will take a 20 per cent stake in Europe's second-largest airline, which was 
privatised in 1997, and keep the right to lift that share to just over 25 per cent to block any hostile takeover attempt.
It will nominate two people to sit on the company's supervisory board.
Lufthansa spurns EU's bailout conditions Airlines ; Slots the sticking point as board declines to approve Berlin's 
(EURO)9bn rescue plan
The European Commission, under pressure from Ryanair, which has threatened to challenge the bailout, wants 
Lufthansa to loosen its grip on its two main hubs before it approves the deal.
Lufthansa holds more than twothirds of the slots in Frankfurt and Munich, both of which are partially state-owned, 
and roughly 60 per cent of the slots in Vienna and Zurich.
On Tuesday, members of Ms Merkel's party and governing coalition expressed opposition to reducing the carrier's 
dominance at the two German airports.
Markus Söder, prime minister of Bavaria, of which Munich is the capital, warned against the hub's slots being given 
to "low-cost providers", which he argued would feel less responsible for the fate of German staff than Lufthansa. Mr 
Söder leads the Christian Social Union party, which is in power in Berlin.
Wolfgang Steiger, secretary-general of the economic council of Ms Merkel's party, the Christian Democratic Union, 
said an emergency situation "must not be used as a lever to permanently change the framework conditions for a 
company". Workers' representatives, who occupy half of Lufthansa's 20 board seats, have also voiced concerns 
about the EU's request.
Pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit emphasised that slots at Frankfurt and Munich were "particularly important in 
order to be able to offer attractive connections and remain competitive".

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) on Wednesday urged German Chancellor Angela Merkel to cancel its 9 billion euros 
($9.91 billion) bail-out of Deutsche Lufthansa, which was deemed "as the only viable alternative for maintaining 
solvency." 
The Irish airline company asked the government to terminate its rescue deal after its German peer refused board 
representation for the government and slots in Frankfurt and Munich.
"The reduction of these travel taxes to zero for the next 24 months would provide Lufthansa with significant funding, 
but would encourage Lufthansa to return to flying while allowing them to keep their precious slots monopoly at 
Frankfurt and Munich Airports, as well as ignoring the German Govt Board membership request," said Chief 
Executive Officer Michael O'Leary.
O'Leary added that Deutsche Lufthansa is also "demanding money from the Swiss Govt, the Austrian Govt and the 
Belgian Govt as well. It's time for Mrs Merkel to tell Lufthansa to 'buzz off' and bring an end to these illegal State Aid 
demands from the 'subsidy junkie' Lufthansa."
Ryanair Holdings' shares declined 2% at the close of market on Wednesday.

May 28, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  United Airlines Holdings 
UAL[1] announced some leadership changes as it focuses on near-term goals to adjust size of the airline per the 
current demand scenario. The carrier's chief operations officer (COO) Greg Hart will step down in order to focus on 
important medium and long-term issues. He will work on changes in cost structure, including labor costs. The 
carrier's CEO Scott Kirby stated, 'Demand could be down 30% or it could be down 70%. The way to best survive 
this crisis is to be able to nimbly adjust the size of the airline, including labor costs, to meet demand and 
importantly, be ready to bounce back quickly when the virus is defeated.'Hart will be replaced by Jon Roitman, 
currently serving as senior vice president of Airport and Network Operations, effective Jun 1. Besides carrying out 
his current responsibilities, Roitman will take charge of flight operations, technical operations, and safety.United

domestic markets as well as some international routes for remainder of the second quarter of 2020. While the

July is expected to be down approximately 75%.Other U.S. carriers like American Airlines AAL[4] and Delta Air 
Lines DAL[5] are also witnessing slight increases in travel demand. For instance, during the U.S. Memorial Day 
weekend, American Airlines' aircraft was filled about 56%. Earlier in the month, Delta revealed plans to increase its 
summer capacity amid signs of improvement in domestic travel demand. The company's CEO Edward Bastian 
stated that he hopes to add around 200 flights in June and another 200 or 300 flights in July.Both American Airlines

May 28, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  At a conference held on 
Wednesday, American Airlines Group AAL[1] informed that it will not file for bankruptcy protection. Reportedly[2], 
there were talks that a major U.S. airline might go out of business once the government aid for it expires.The 
company's chief executive officer Doug Parker stated, "Bankruptcy is failure. We're not going to do that." He feels 
that no airline is likely to 'go by the wayside as a result of this crisis."He further predicted that the U.S. airline 
industry is likely to shrink by 10-20% in summer 2021 and its rebound would depend on passenger demand and 
revenues generated. With easing travel restrictions, American Airlines, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is seeing 
modest increases in passenger numbers. New bookings have been more than the number of cancellations over 
past few weeks. During the U.S. Memorial Day weekend, the carrier's aircraft was filled about 56%. The passenger 
load is encouraging although it reflects a significantly reduced capacity. The carrier is operating only about 20% of 
its 
usual 
schedule

to

May 28, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  The British airline EasyJet[1] 
announced its plans to cut up to 30% of its employees, to save costs amid the coronavirus crisis. 'To effect the 
restructure of our business, EasyJet will shortly launch an employee consultation process on proposals to reduce 
staff numbers by up to 30%, reflecting the reduced fleet, the optimisation of our network and bases, improved 
productivity as well as the promotion of more efficient ways of working', the airline said. 
The company employed 15,000 people at the beginning of the year. Earlier, it announced it would restart flights on 
June 15, but added that it does not expect to reach the 2019 levels of demand until at least 2023. In March, the 
airline grounded its entire fleet[2] as a response to the global travel bans aimed at containing the coronavirus 
pandemic. 'We realise these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will 
impact our people - but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long term', CEO Johan Lundgren said. 
Other airlines announced major layoffs as well. Ryanair said it would cut 15% of its staff, Wizz intends to reduce its 
workforce by 19%, and British Airways is set to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforce. [ 1]:

Ryanair sees planes up to 60% full in July
Ryanair sees planes up to 60% full in July

Ryanair expects Britain to join other European nations in dropping COVID-19 quarantine plans in the coming 
weeks, its CEO told Reuters on Wednesday, as he reported a "big surge" in holiday bookings from the country.
Last week, Britain announced a 14-day quarantine from June 8 for all air passenger arrivals, including its own 
citizens, even as countries such as Italy and Spain move to ease equivalent restrictions.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said many Britons had not been deterred by the move, with booking rates in recent 
days indicating the 1,000 daily flights it plans to fly in July - 40% of normal capacity - were likely to be 50% to 60% 
full.
"The UK and Ireland will either quietly drop them (quarantine plans) or drop them as another easing measure in the 
next week or two. I am confident of that," he said in an interview.
"We have seen a big surge in bookings on our flights out of Ireland and the UK to Spain, Portugal and Italy over the 
weekend, and that seems to be continuing this week."
Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, hopes a busy holiday season will boost confidence for a return of business 
travel.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's top adviser Dominic Cummings, who provoked outrage by making a 400 km 
(250 mile) road trip during the lockdown, has "completely undermined the UK government's credibility" on the 
quarantine issue, O'Leary said.
Ryanair sees planes up to 60% full in July
The CEO repeated his prediction that Ryanair's passenger numbers would return to 2019 levels by summer 2021 
and said that if unions across Europe agreed to pay cuts the airline might be able to make fewer redundancies than 
the current plan of 3,000.
"I would be hopeful that the 3,000 figure would be significantly lower because of the progress that we are making on 
reasonable pay cuts across Europe," he said, saying 25-30% of crew had agreed to cuts so far.
In bases where pay cuts are refused, up to half of pilots and cabin crew could be laid off this year, he said, citing 
Ryanair's home base of Dublin as a possible target.
O'Leary said he had rejected an offer by Irish union Forsa to avoid job and pay cuts by shifting crew to part time as 
it did not deliver unit cost savings. Forsa has said the insistence on a 5-year pay cut is unreasonable as 
management forecasts traffic and fare levels may recover in two years. (Reuters)

Lufthansa board rejects EU conditions on $10 billion bailout
Lufthansa board rejects EU conditions on $10 billion bailout

Lufthansa's $10 billion government bailout was thrown into doubt on Wednesday after the German airline's 
supervisory board refused to accept the conditions attached by Brussels.
The board, which had been expected to sign off on the aid, instead refused EU requirements that Lufthansa 
permanently give up take-off and landing slots at Frankfurt and Munich airports, where it commands a two-thirds 
market share.
The bailout plan nevertheless remains "the only viable alternative" to insolvency, Lufthansa said, and negotiations 
will continue over EU demands that would "lead to a weakening" of its airport hubs as well as its ability to repay 
loans.
The European Commission had "no comment on the specific case", a spokesperson said.
Terms discussed with Brussels included the forfeiture of 72 slots used by 12 of 300 jets based at the two airports, a 
source familiar with the matter said. But whereas Lufthansa wanted to reclaim the slots after repaying aid, the 
Commission sought permanent concessions, the person said.
Airlines including Air France-KLM and the main U.S. carriers have all sought government aid to ride out the 
coronavirus crisis, which has brought air travel to a near-halt.
The bailout deal announced on Monday would see the German government take a 20% stake in Lufthansa in return 
for a 6 billion euro injection of new capital, most of it non-voting, combined with 3 billion in state-backed loans.
The Lufthansa group employs around 138,000 people, according to its website.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said after the board announcement he still expected Brussels to approve the 
package.
"It's not only in Germany's interests but also in the European Union's interests to avoid a sell-off of strategic 
interests in the industrial sector as a result of this pandemic," Altmaier added.
Some rival airlines disagree.
Lufthansa board rejects EU conditions on $10 billion bailout
Low-cost carrier Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary vowed on Tuesday to challenge a bailout package he 
said would "massively distort competition" in the German market for the next five years.
"It is deeply ironic that the German government, which lectures all other EU countries about respecting EU rules, 
has no difficulty breaking the State Aid rules when it comes to Lufthansa," O'Leary said in a Ryanair statement.
But the German Cockpit Association, a pilots' union, also warned that giving up slots to budget rivals would threaten 
European jobs and labour standards.
"Some airlines in the low-cost segment have large financial reserves because they have disregarded the rights of 
employees for years and ... passed on their business risk to their employees," the group said.
"It cannot be the goal of German and European rescue policy to save companies from insolvency with billions in 
cash and at the same time put them at a severe disadvantage."

Lufthansa may be forced to give up coveted slots at Frankfurt and Munich airports as the European Commission 
pushes to attach conditions to Germany's (EURO)9bn bailout of the airline and Ryanair threatens to challenge the 
deal.
Angela Merkel's administration agreed on Monday to support the country's national carrier, which has been 
appealing for state aid in four countries as the coronavirus crisis cut its operations to 1 per cent of its regular 
capacity. As part of the rescue package, Berlin will take a 20 per cent stake in Europe's second-largest airline, 
which was first privatised in 1997, with the option of increasing that to a blocking minority of 25 per cent, plus one 
share, in the event of a hostile takeover bid.
However, EU officials are concerned that the deal may undermine competition and are in discussions to force the 
airline to get rid of some slots to make sure rivals have a fair advantage, people with direct knowledge of the talks 
said.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive at Ryanair, also joined the fray, saying that his low-cost airline was planning to 
lodge an appeal against the rescue package, which he said would "further strengthen Lufthansa's monopoly-like 
grip on the German air travel market".
Lufthansa faces bailout heat over slots Airlines ; EU calls for concessions to clear (EURO)9bn state rescue as

"Lufthansa is addicted to state aid," Mr O'Leary added, arguing that the (EURO)9bn bailout would allow the group to 
"engage in below-cost selling or buy up even more competition for the next number of years".
Ms Merkel's party, the CDU, hit back at talks in Brussels over reducing slots, warning that Lufthansa's bailout, which 
it referred to as a "temporary strengthening of a European flagship carrier" must not be jeopardised by 
"overregulation in Brussels".
"The hubs of Frankfurt and Munich must not be weakened in relation to Paris and Amsterdam," said Ulrich Lange, 
deputy chairman of the CDU and CSU group in the German parliament.
Sources in Brussels stressed the remedies being sought mission would not undermine Lufthansa's business model 
and that any divestitures were aimed at ensuring a level playing field and in proportion to the advantages the 
German carrier already receives.
In the past Lufthansa has offered to sell slots to get deals such as its purchase of Air Berlin cleared. The German 
group, which includes Austrian, Brussels, Swiss and Eurowings airlines, holds more than two-thirds of the slots at 
Munich and Frankfurt, its two main hubs, and roughly 60 per cent of the available slots at Vienna and Zurich 
airports.
After Monday's announcement, unions, investors and political figures warned against relinquishing slots.
Investors, whose shares will be diluted once Berlin builds its stake, have also opposed such moves.
Lufthansa refused to comment.

 Irish airline Ryanair (RYAAY) Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary reported a surge in holiday bookings from 
Britain and now expects the country to drop its planned 14-day COVID-19 quarantine from June 8 for all air 
passenger arrivals, joining other European countries, Reuters reported Wednesday.
O'Leary said in an interview with the media outlet that the 1,000 daily flights it intends to fly in July, which is 40% of 
normal capacity, are expected to be 50% to 60% full, based on the booking rates in recent days.
"We have seen a big surge in bookings on our flights out of Ireland and the UK to Spain, Portugal and Italy over the 
weekend, and that seems to be continuing this week," O'Leary said, the report added.

 Ryanair (RYAAY), Europe's largest low fares airline, late on Wednesday called on German Chancellor Angela 
Merkel to abandon plans to give 9 billion-euro ($9.86 billion) of what the airline company called  "illegal State Aid" to 
the country's flagship carrier, Lufthansa.
The Dublin-based group said Lufthansa claims funding "as the only viable alternative for maintaining solvency," 
according to a statement. Yet, Lufthansa refuses to give Germany effective board representation, which would allow 
the government directors to participate in board decisions, Ryanair said.
Ryanair also pointed out that Lufthansa also "refuses to hand over slots in Frankfurt and Munich, which would 
promote competition and choice to the Lufthansa monopoly in Germany."
The Irish airline also called upon the German government to reduce air travel taxes for all airlines operating in 
Germany.

May 27, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, Latin 
American carrier LATAM Airlines Group LTM[1] filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection due to the coronavirus-induced 
fast-evaporating air-travel demand. Notably, the sinking air-travel demand caused many carriers to post losses in 
the March quarter, the latest being another Latin American carrier Azul AZUL[2], which it confirmed while 
announcing first-quarter financial numbers in the previous week[3].Delta Air Lines DAL[4] also grabbed headlines in 
the past week with its CEO Edward Bastian stating that he hopes to add around 200 flights in June and another 200 
or 300 flights in July. Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] expressed its displeasure over the government-
backed EUR9 billion bailout package to German carrier Deutsche Lufthansa DLAKY[6].Wrap-Up on the Past 
Week's Key Headlines1. LATAM Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States as it 
grapples with a dramatic drop in air travel demand amid coronavirus concerns. Along with the Latin American 
carrier, its affiliates in Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and the United States are part of the bankruptcy filing, while 
those in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay are not. 
Despite the restructuring, LATAM Airlines and its affiliates will continue usual passenger and cargo operations[7].2. 
Delta expects to increase its summer capacity amid signs of improvement in domestic travel demand. To comply 
with social distancing norms amid coronavirus concerns, Delta, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has capped 
passenger load to only 60% of the total number of seats. Additionally, the airline is making constant efforts to 
sanitize aircraft in order to encourage passengers to travel[8].You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[9].3. In a bid to win back passengers, United Airlines UAL[10] launched a new 
cleanliness program — United CleanPlus — in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic and Clorox to combat the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The deal with Cleveland Clinic aims to promote United Airlines' cleaning, safety and social 
distancing protocols. Initially, Clorox products will be used at the gates and terminals of United Airlines hub airports, 
Chicago and Denver[11].4. Per aReuters report[12], Ryanair challenged the impending government rescue package 
for Lufthansa. The European low-cost carrier fears that the huge state aid, which will become effective following 
approval by the European Commission (expected shortly), will distort competition and deny a level playing field to 
low-cost carriers like Ryanair. The package, once effective, might offer Lufthansa unfair advantage as it may 
'engage in below-cost selling.'5. Spirit Airlines presented a rosy picture at an investor presentation. Management 
stated that its low-cost structure has enabled it to withstand the current coronavirus-led crisis. The current average

daily cash burn rate of $4 million is expected to improve in the second half of 2020. In a bid to preserve cash, the 
carrier reduced the current-year planned gross capital expenses by $235 million. To bolster its liquidity position, the 
carrier has finalized a deal with the U.S. treasury Department for payroll support of approximately $335 million 
($264 million in grants which it does not have to pay back and $71 million in unsecured low-interest loan) under the 
CARES Act. Low fuel costs are also providing cushion to the bottom line.Performance The following table shows

May 27, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair said it would challenge the 
German government's decision to award €9 bn state aid to Lufthansa, citing that it breaches EU state aid rules and 
results in a 'monopoly' in the German domestic market. 'The German Govt continues to ignore EU rules when it 
suits them to subsidise large German companies, but then lectures every other EU Govt about respecting the rules 
when they ignore them,' Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement on Tuesday. 
'Ryanair will appeal against this latest example of illegal state aid to Lufthansa, which will massively distort 
competition,' he added. The budget airline's chief executive heavily criticised the German company for being 
'addicted to state aid,' adding that'whenever there is a crisis, Lufthansa's first reflex is to put its hand in the German 
Government's pocket.' Citing that Lufthansa has been asking for support from several countries, including Austria, 
Switzerland and Belgium, Ryanair's CEO supported thatthe German company 'stumbles around Europe sucking up 
as much State Aid as it can possibly gather,'while other airlines are surviving on 'just payroll support schemes'. 
O'Leary's statement came after Lufthansa announced[1] on Monday it was approved for a €9 bn bailout package 
from Germany's Economic Stabilisation Fund, to survive the Coronavirus crisis. Lufthansa's bailout needs to be 
approved 
both 
by 
the 
company's 
shareholders 
and 
the

Commission.

May 26, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Irish no-frills 
airline Ryanair said Tuesday it will appeal against Germany's temporary partial nationalisation of rival carrier 
Lufthansa, arguing the rescue deal constitutes "illegal state aid" that distorts competition.Berlin had launched 
Monday a nine-billion-euro ($9.8-billion) rescue of Lufthansa under a deal that sees it take a 20-percent stake of the 
coronavirus-ravaged group."The German government continues to ignore EU rules when it suits them to subsidise 
large German companies, but then lectures every other EU government about respecting the rules when they 
ignore them," said Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary in a statement."Ryanair will appeal against this latest 
example of illegal state aid to Lufthansa, which will massively distort competition and level playing field into 
provision of flights to and from Germany for the next five years."The Dublin-based carrier had meanwhile taken a 
?600-million loan earlier this month from the UK government's COVID Corporate Financing Facility, as the deadly 
COVID-19 outbreak grounded planes worldwide and sparked a collapse in global travel. 
O'Leary calls state aid for Lufthansa 'illegal' Photo: AFP / Kenzo TRIBOUILLARD  Ryanair however argues that the 
facility, which is designed to help coronavirus-hit companies and is adminstered by the Bank of England, does not 
compare to Lufthansa's rescue package."Lufthansa is addicted to state aid. Whenever there is a crisis, Lufthansa's 
first reflex is to put its hand in the German government's pocket," said O'Leary. The Irish travel giant had 
announced last week that its annual profit fell as the coronavirus halted travel -- and the airline had bet on jet fuel 
prices being much higher ahead of an oil-price crash.Net profit including exceptional items sank almost a third to 
649 million euros in the year to March 31, as global lockdowns heavily impacted the end of the period.Since the 
middle of March the airline has been operating only 30 flights per day between Britain, Ireland and the rest of 
Europe.Ryanair is meanwhile cutting 3,000 pilot and cabin crew jobs, or 15 percent of staff, mirroring moves by 
airlines globally to save cash in the face of collapsing demand.

Low-cost airline Ryanair on Tuesday slammed a bailout plan for German rival Lufthansa, saying it "distorts 
competition" with other airlines across Europe.
The criticism came the day after the German government and Lufthansa said they had agreed on a deal providing 
aid and equity measures worth 9 billion euros (9.8 billion dollars).
The deal was yet to be approved by Lufthansa's supervisory board and the European Commission's competition 
watchdog.
The status of some 138,000 employed by the airline and its many subsidiaries, including Austrian and Brussels, 
was a major factor.
Ryanair claimed the move would "further strengthen Lufthansa's monopoly-like grip on the German air travel 
market."
Ryanair group chief executive Michael O'Leary said it was "deeply ironic that the German government, which 
lectures all other EU countries about respecting EU rules, has no difficulty breaking the state aid rules when it 
comes to Lufthansa."
Ryanair will "appeal against this latest example of illegal state aid to Lufthansa," he added.
Germany has not yet officially notified the EU executive branch about the Lufthansa deal, a spokesperson for the 
European Commission said on Tuesday, declining to make any specific comment on the case.
In general, large recapitalizations of more than 250 million euros comes with stricter conditions than other state aid 
initiatives, Arianna Podesta said.
Meanwhile, Bavarian state premier Markus Soeder warned against making too many concessions for EU approval.
Ryanair slams German government bailout plan for rival Lufthansa
If Lufthansa were to be forced to give up airport slots in the main cities of Frankfurt and Munich to other airlines, it 
would be an "incomprehensible constraint," he said in Munich.

 Ireland's Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) will appeal against an "illegal" 9 billion euro ($9.83 billion) bailout for Deutsche 
Lufthansa, which it claims will "massively distort" competition in the German air travel market.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive officer of the budget airline, said Tuesday the bailout package from the German 
government allows Lufthansa to "engage in below-cost selling or buy up even more competition" while making it 
harder for Ryanair, its unit Laudamotion and EasyJet (EZJ.L) to compete in the German market.
"Whenever there is a crisis, Lufthansa's first reflex is to put its hand in the German government's pocket," O'Leary 
said. "The German government continues to ignore EU rules when it suits them to subsidize large German 
companies, but then lectures every other EU government about respecting the rules when they ignore them."
Ryanair shares jumped 10% on Tuesday midday.

May 26, 2020( Zolmax.com: http://www.zolmax.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) was 
upgraded by Zacks Investment Research[1] from a "strong sell" rating to a "buy" rating in a note issued to investors 
on Tuesday, Zacks.com[2] reports. The firm presently has a $68.00 price target on the transportation company's 
stock. Zacks Investment Research[3]'s price objective suggests a potential upside of 6.75% from the company's 
previous close. 
According to Zacks, "Travel demand woes due to coronavirus are weighing on Ryanair's operations. The carrier's 
fiscal 2020 profits were hurt by over €40 million due to coronavirus-led reduced demand. Moreover, traffic 
decreased by more than 5 million in the period. Amid these adversities, the carrier expects to incur a loss of more 
than €200 million in first quarter fiscal 2021. Moreover, it expects to transport less than 80 million passengers during 
fiscal 2021. Due to the coronavirus-related headwinds, shares of the company have declined more than 25% since 
the beginning of February. Persistent below-par performance of the Laudamotion unit is also concerning. Notably, 
the company's cost-cutting measures are impressive.Moreover, the airline's strong liquidity position is 
noteworthy."Several other research firms also recently issued reports on RYAAY. Berenberg Bank upgraded 
Ryanair from a "sell" rating to a "hold" rating in a research note on Wednesday, January 29th. Cantor Fitzgerald

BNP Paribas upgraded Ryanair from an "underperform" rating to a "neutral" rating in a research note on Thursday, 
February 27th. Finally, Canaccord Genuity restated a "hold" rating on shares of Ryanair in a research note on 
Monday, April 6th. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, seven have issued a hold rating, 
ten have given a buy rating and one has given a strong buy rating to the stock. Ryanair currently has an average 
rating of "Buy" and an average price target of $66.50.NASDAQ:RYAAY[5] opened at $63.70 on Tuesday. The firm

average price is $75.26. Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) last issued its earnings results on Monday, May 18th. The 
transportation company reported ($2.89) earnings per share for the quarter, missing the consensus estimate of

Europe's biggest low budget airline has said a €9 billion government rescue package for the German flag carrier 
amounts to an "illegal subsidy." Ryanair's CEO said Lufthansa is "addicted to state aid."Ryanair said Tuesday it 
would contest a €9 billion ($9.9 billion) aid package from the German government to prop up Lufthansa. 
The aid package must still be cleared by the European Commission's competition arm. In a statement, the Ireland-
based budget carrier's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said the government-backed aid would make it harder for budget 
airlines like Ryanair to compete in short haul markets to and from Germany.Read more: Lufthansa to resume to 20 
destinations in June"Ryanair will appeal against this latest example of illegal state aid to Lufthansa, which will 
massively distort competition.""How can airlines like Ryanair, EasyJet and Laudamotion be expected to compete 
with Lufthansa now that it has €9 billion worth of subsidies?"Lufthansa's deal with Berlin Following weeks of 
negotiation, theGerman government and Lufthansa struck a deal on state aid including secured loans and a 20% 
government shareholder stake in the airline. But first, EU competition regulators must evaluate whether the 
government aid package restricts competition in the European aviation sector.Under EU law, member states are 
generally prohibited from providing financial aid to national companies because it can distort fair competition in the 
EU's single market.However, as the coronavirus pandemic has hit many sectors hard, especially aviation, 
regulators in Brussels have allowed for looser regulations.'State-aid junkies' In the statement, O'Leary said the 
package would "tighten Lufthansa's monopoly grip" on the German aviation market. "Lufthansa is addicted to state 
aid. Whenever there is a crisis, Lufthansa's first reflex is to put its hand in the German Government's pocket," 
O'Leary said.Read more: Opinion — When the state gets on boardEarlier in May, O'Leary said Ryanair had lost 
over €100 million in the first quarter of 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic all but shut down air travel in Europe. He 
has also referred to flag carrier airlines like Lufthansa and Air France as "state aid junkies."Around 90% of 
Lufthansa's regular flights have been grounded for several weeks during the pandemic. The company is currently 
estimated to be losing around €1 million euros every hour.wmr/rc (Reuters, dpa)Every evening, DW sends out a

Ryanair Holdings has said that while it will not request or receive state aid to help it cope with the coronavirus crisis, 
it did manage to raise GBP600 million pounds (USD730 million) in unsecured debt last month from the UK's Covid 
Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) state-backed loan scheme. In its final full-year results statement to March 31, 
2020, which confirmed a profit of EUR1.002 billion (USD1.09 billion), up 13% on the previous year, Ryanair listed 
seven European airlines that have received "unlawful state aid to date." When the group, which includes Ryanair, 
Ryanair UK as well as Lauda, Buzz, and Malta Air, "returns to scheduled flying from July, the competitive landscape 
in Europe will be distorted by unprecedented quantums of state aid (in breach of EU rules) [...]. We, therefore, 
expect that traffic on reduced flight schedules will be subject to significant price discounting, and below cost selling, 
from these flag carriers with huge state aid war chests," the statement protested. "Unlike many flag carrier 
competitors, Ryanair will not request or receive state aid. Consultations about base closures, pay cuts of up to 20%, 
unpaid leave, and up to 3,000 job cuts (mainly pilots and cabin crew) are underway with our people and our 
unions," it added.

POINTSThe deal still needs approval from Lufthansa's advisory board and shareholders, as well as European 
regulatorsThe company lost $1.09 million an hour in AprilMost of Lufthansa's planes are grounded and the 
company estimates it has 100 too many The German government Monday agreed to a nine billion euro[1] ($9.8 
billion) rescue package for Lufthansa (LHA.DE[2]), which has suffered severe financial fallout from travel bans 
prompted by the coronavirus pandemic. Europe's second-largest airline had been financially healthy and profitable 
before the pandemic hit.The deal, which had been in the works for weeks, is the largest German corporate rescue 
since the pandemic hit and the only one that involves direct investment by the government, which has a 100 billion-
euro ($109 billion) fund to buy stakes in companies destabilized by the outbreak.The deal, which needs approval 
from Lufthansa's advisory board and shareholders, as well as European regulators, gives Berlin a 20% stake in the 
carrier, which in April said it was losing 1 million euros ($1.09 million) an hour. 
The government share could grow to 25% under certain conditions.The deal is expected to face a challenge from 
Ryanair, the discount carrier that already has challenged an Air France bailout.'The Executive Board also supports 
the package,' Lufthansa said in a statement.The agreement does not have an expiration date and provides the 
government will be a silent partner although it will have two seats on the advisory board.Most of the airline's 760 
plans currently are grounded, and CEO Carsten Spohr said the company likely has 100 more planes than it needs. 
Streamlined flight operations[3] are expected to resume in mid-June, but about 300 planes are expected to 
remained grounded through 2021 while 200 likely will be sidelined into 2022. Job cuts also are expected, perhaps 
as many as 10,000. 'Before the coronavirus pandemic, the company was operatively healthy and profitable and had 
good prospects for the future,' the economy ministry said in a statement[4].The basis of the agreement was worked 
out last week, sending stock prices higher. Share values have been cut in half this year, and the value of the 
company reduced to 4.1 billion euros (nearly $4.5 billion).Lufthansa also secured help from Switzerland: 1.28 billion 
Swiss francs ($1.3 billion) in credit guarantees and is working on deals with Austria and Belgium. [ 1]:

bought for an aborted trip to the Alps, perhaps, or frocks never worn to a beach wedding.
The cost of refunds is already evident in the travel industry. Airline Ryanair is processing 10m a month - 1,000 times 
its usual level. Travel agency Tui is returning (EURO)250m-(EURO)300m a month in cash refunds. Shops have so 
far escaped the onslaught because of being closed. But they, and their investors, will soon join the club.
Online clothing stores typically suffer return rates of around 40-50 per cent. Berlin-based Zalando ranked itself at 
the top end, in its IPO prospectus.
Forrester, the consultancy, estimates a total of $539bn worth of goods were returned in the US last year - mor - 
than retail heavyweight Walmart sold in the same period.
Free returns have been championed by ecommerce groups as a way to reassure customers wary of buying clothes 
unseen. In the wake of lockdowns, ecommerce groups such as Amazon and physical stores such as Next have 
extended return periods.
B-Stock, an eBay style marketplace for returned and other liquidation merchandise, expects a 30 per cent increase 
in apparel inventory over the next six weeks as retailers shift customers' - and their own - unwanted stock.
Retail refunds: frocky horror show
Some stores are also bankrolling extra pandemic-induced measures, such as couriers to pick up unwanted items. 
These add to an average cost of $10 per return and mean working capital is tied up in boxes in homes.
Worse, the ability to resell items - usually the fate of half of all returns, not all at full cost - is lower.
February-bought skirts go out of fashion quickly. More will end up being liquidated or go to landfill.
Companies demur that the changed mix of sales softens the blow.
Customers' current predilections are for beauty creams and loungearound-the-house-wear. These are less likely to 
be returned than a frock.
But for many, mass job losses and emptier social calendars mean cash will prove more alluring than unused 
purchases.

Tina is standing in Paris Charles de Gaulle airport with her one-and-a-halfyear-old daughter on her way home to 
Kinshasa from London.
"The flight was full - no seats between us and other people," said the 30-year-old woman. "They didn't take our 
temperature, and that worried me."
That will soon change. ADP, which runs Charles de Gaulle, this month put in place temperature checks to scan 
passengers as the aviation industry rushes to restore confidence and attempt to restart the sector.
The airport shows signs of what has quickly become the new normal: social distance markers divide floor space 
before check-in desks, seats in the departure lounges carry stickers warning people to sit apart, perspex glass 
shields staff as they assign seats, at every entrance masks and gels await.
"Just like after 9/11 travellers needed assurance that there were no weapons on board, now they will need to be 
reassured by airlines and airports that there are no viruses on board," said Shashank Nigam, chief executive of 
SimpliFlying, a consultancy.
Airlines set for gruelling post-pandemic journey A very different flying experience awaits passengers as sector

Most carriers and airports insist on face masks for passengers and staff, as well as providing hand sanitisers and 
conducting deeper cabin cleaning. The industry has been keen to reassure passengers that air travel is one of the 
safest ways to travel.
Boeing's Jim Haas, director of product marketing, said the air on board was "virus-free" thanks to the Hepa filters on 
all modern aircraft. These filter air to hospital operating-theatre quality.
Some airports such as Hong Kong have gone further, with tests for arrivals, while immunity passports could be 
included as temporary biosecurity measures. "Your health certificate is going to be as important as your visa," said 
Andrew Charlton, a consultant.
Flights will look different: some airlines will no longer offer food, or at best will provide pre-packaged items to limit 
contamination. Magazines have been taken off planes. Ryanair's customers will be banned from queueing for the 
toilet. Some carriers, such as Air France, have introduced temperature checks before flights.
It comes as many airlines are hoping for a recovery in air travel to start in July, bringing to an end a lengthy 
threemonth shutdown that has left carriers with virtually no revenues and tens of thousands of job cuts.
"It's pretty obvious it's a cataclysmic situation," Tim Clark, Emirates president, said. But he added that during the 
1997 Asian financial crisis, war in the Gulf, and the global financial crisis, "each of those times I thought, oh crikey, 
this is going to be a bad one. What are we going to do? But we got through it and made money afterwards."
However, the path to flying again looks difficult. The European Commission this month published a plan that 
envisages a co-ordinated gradual lifting of border restrictions. Both the UK and Spain have proposed 14-day 
quarantines on arriving travellers, a move that in effect shuts down international travel. Other countries, such as 
Australia and New Zealand, are setting up safe travel corridors between regions that have contained the virus. One 
has been set up in the Baltics.
It has left many airline executives worried. "It's clear from everything we've seen, the period of recovery is going to 
take much longer than anything we've witnessed before," Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways parent 
IAG, said this month. "We hope going forward we'll see a co-ordinated response, but to be honest that's more of a 
hope than an expectation."
Many carriers believe cheap fares will help stimulate demand. Jozsef Varadi, chief executive at Wizz Air, thinks the 
demand is already there. The carrier started flying again on select locations from the beginning of May, and its 
planes are between 70 per cent and 75 per cent full. "It's better than most people would have expected."
Mr Charlton said: "In the short term, we're likely to see airlines flooding the market with cheap tickets to get people 
over their fears. But once we get over the sugar rush, I think it's inevitable that prices go up because there will be 
fewer airlines." Carriers will have large debts to repay and will need to shore up their balance sheets.
One issue is potential enforcement by individual countries of social distancing at the airport and on board. Airlines 
were relieved this week when guidelines on safe air travel by the European Aviation Safety Agency stopped short of 
insisting that airlines ensure distancing on board. While many carriers have said they will try to ensure distancing on 
planes in the early months, when aircraft are unlikely to be full, this has already caused problems. United and 
American have come under fire after passengers tweeted pictures of packed planes. United had emailed to say it 
would automatically block middle seats. It later admitted it could not guarantee passengers would be seated next to 
empty seats on all flights.
Frontier Airlines tried asking customers to pay at least $39 to sit next to an empty seat, only to drop the fee days 
later amid claims of profiteering.
Iata said any move for social distancing on aircraft would "fundamentally shift" the economics of aviation by 
slashing the maximum load factor to 62 per cent - well below the average industry break-even load factor of 77 per

cent. This would ultimately lead to a rise in ticket prices, with Iata estimating prices could rise by up to 54 per cent 
compared to 2019 just to cover costs.
Airports face a similar quandary. While distancing is possible in some parts of the building, ACI Europe, the trade 
body, has warned that applying strict distancing at all key operational processes would limit capacity to between 20 
per cent and 40 per cent. Queues at security checkpoints would also become even more painfully long. For 
example, an aircraft with 189 seats would result in a queue of at least 380 metres for a single security lane.
Easa guidelines said that when physical distancing of 1.5 metres was not possible due to infrastructure or 
operational constraints, carriers and airport operators should implement additional risk-mitigation measures such as 
hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.
While distancing could be introduced at airport shops and restaurants, this would have a big impact on revenues. 
Olivier Jankovec, head of ACI Europe, acknowledged that this would be the price to pay in the short term. "Anything 
is better than where we are today, where all revenues have disappeared. Passenger traffic is down 98 per cent for 
six weeks in a row. I think what is important is that we can restart operations."
There is uncertainty over the longterm structure of the aviation market. Airlines and airports are having to reassess 
the size of operations in the face of a slow and difficult recovery that could take up to three years to return to pre-
Covid-19 traffic levels. BA has announced plans to cut up to 30 per cent of its 42,000-strong workforce, while 
Ryanair is looking at axing 15 per cent.
Geoffrey Weston, partner at Bain & Company, thinks there is a "danger zone" when airlines look to ramp up 
capacity to about two-thirds of previous levels. "At the moment in many countries, there's government support for 
employees. When you start flying again, and you lose some of that government support ... and you are now 
incurring your cash costs of flying on very low load factors, it might be worse than keeping your planes on the 
ground."
There is concern among airline chiefs over what demand there will be for business travel. Citi estimates that 
corporate travel could be impaired by 25 per cent versus 2019 levels, driven by the proliferation of virtual meetings 
and varying quarantining and border rules. This would make it a "struggle for a lot of airlines that carry international 
and business travellers ... to make money", said Mark Manduca, aviation analyst at Citi.
Companies are reassessing their travel policies. Jean-Sébastien Jacques, chief executive of Rio Tinto, said its 
spending on long-haul air travel could fall by as much as 75 per cent over the next six months. "We used to have a 
big budget for international travel between continents, and I am sure that is going to shrink very quickly."
Mr Nigam thinks carriers may need to think creatively about boosting profits, from introducing subscription services 
to bigger premium economy cabins, allowing people to distance while paying a little more than economy class. 
"There will be some impact ... if everyone's enjoying being on Zoom videos," Ed Bastian, Delta head, said last 
month. "I personally don't, but maybe some people do. Maybe that will change the nature of travel a bit. But 
business is done face to face. People enjoy experiences. All the things we've seen ... actually have, in my opinion, 
caused people to miss travel more than ever before in this lockdown phase. And we'll get back." Additional

Most carriers and airports insist on face masks for passengers and staff, as well as providing hand sanitisers and 
conducting deeper cabin cleaning. The industry has been keen to reassure passengers that air travel is one of the 
safest ways to travel.
Boeing's Jim Haas, director of product marketing, said the air on board was "virus-free" thanks to the Hepa filters on 
all modern aircraft. These filter air to hospital operating-theatre quality.
Some airports such as Hong Kong have gone further, with tests for arrivals, while immunity passports could be 
included as temporary biosecurity measures. "Your health certificate is going to be as important as your visa," said 
Andrew Charlton, a consultant.
Flights will look different: some airlines will no longer offer food, or at best will provide pre-packaged items to limit 
contamination. Magazines have been taken off planes. Ryanair's customers will be banned from queueing for the 
toilet. Some carriers, such as Air France, have introduced temperature checks before flights.
It comes as many airlines are hoping for a recovery in air travel to start in July, bringing to an end a lengthy 
threemonth shutdown that has left carriers with virtually no revenues and tens of thousands of job cuts.
"It's pretty obvious it's a cataclysmic situation," Tim Clark, Emirates president, said. But he added that during the 
1997 Asian financial crisis, war in the Gulf, and the global financial crisis, "each of those times I thought, oh crikey, 
this is going to be a bad one. What are we going to do? But we got through it and made money afterwards."
However, the path to flying again looks difficult. The European Commission this month published a plan that 
envisages a co-ordinated gradual lifting of border restrictions. Both the UK and Spain have proposed 14-day 
quarantines on arriving travellers, a move that in effect shuts down international travel. Other countries, such as 
Australia and New Zealand, are setting up safe travel corridors between regions that have contained the virus. One 
has been set up in the Baltics.
It has left many airline executives worried. "It's clear from everything we've seen, the period of recovery is going to 
take much longer than anything we've witnessed before," Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways parent 
IAG, said this month. "We hope going forward we'll see a co-ordinated response, but to be honest that's more of a 
hope than an expectation."
Many carriers believe cheap fares will help stimulate demand. Jozsef Varadi, chief executive at Wizz Air, thinks the 
demand is already there. The carrier started flying again on select locations from the beginning of May, and its 
planes are between 70 per cent and 75 per cent full. "It's better than most people would have expected."
Mr Charlton said: "In the short term, we're likely to see airlines flooding the market with cheap tickets to get people 
over their fears. But once we get over the sugar rush, I think it's inevitable that prices go up because there will be 
fewer airlines." Carriers will have large debts to repay and will need to shore up their balance sheets.
One issue is potential enforcement by individual countries of social distancing at the airport and on board. Airlines 
were relieved this week when guidelines on safe air travel by the European Aviation Safety Agency stopped short of 
insisting that airlines ensure distancing on board. While many carriers have said they will try to ensure distancing on 
planes in the early months, when aircraft are unlikely to be full, this has already caused problems. United and 
American have come under fire after passengers tweeted pictures of packed planes. United had emailed to say it 
would automatically block middle seats. It later admitted it could not guarantee passengers would be seated next to 
empty seats on all flights.
Frontier Airlines tried asking customers to pay at least $39 to sit next to an empty seat, only to drop the fee days 
later amid claims of profiteering.
Iata said any move for social distancing on aircraft would "fundamentally shift" the economics of aviation by 
slashing the maximum load factor to 62 per cent - well below the average industry break-even load factor of 77 per

cent. This would ultimately lead to a rise in ticket prices, with Iata estimating prices could rise by up to 54 per cent 
compared to 2019 just to cover costs.
Airports face a similar quandary. While distancing is possible in some parts of the building, ACI Europe, the trade 
body, has warned that applying strict distancing at all key operational processes would limit capacity to between 20 
per cent and 40 per cent. Queues at security checkpoints would also become even more painfully long. For 
example, an aircraft with 189 seats would result in a queue of at least 380 metres for a single security lane.
Easa guidelines said that when physical distancing of 1.5 metres was not possible due to infrastructure or 
operational constraints, carriers and airport operators should implement additional risk-mitigation measures such as 
hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.
While distancing could be introduced at airport shops and restaurants, this would have a big impact on revenues. 
Olivier Jankovec, head of ACI Europe, acknowledged that this would be the price to pay in the short term. "Anything 
is better than where we are today, where all revenues have disappeared. Passenger traffic is down 98 per cent for 
six weeks in a row. I think what is important is that we can restart operations."
There is uncertainty over the longterm structure of the aviation market. Airlines and airports are having to reassess 
the size of operations in the face of a slow and difficult recovery that could take up to three years to return to pre-
Covid-19 traffic levels. BA has announced plans to cut up to 30 per cent of its 42,000-strong workforce, while 
Ryanair is looking at axing 15 per cent.
Geoffrey Weston, partner at Bain & Company, thinks there is a "danger zone" when airlines look to ramp up 
capacity to about two-thirds of previous levels. "At the moment in many countries, there's government support for 
employees. When you start flying again, and you lose some of that government support ... and you are now 
incurring your cash costs of flying on very low load factors, it might be worse than keeping your planes on the 
ground."
There is concern among airline chiefs over what demand there will be for business travel. Citi estimates that 
corporate travel could be impaired by 25 per cent versus 2019 levels, driven by the proliferation of virtual meetings 
and varying quarantining and border rules. This would make it a "struggle for a lot of airlines that carry international 
and business travellers ... to make money", said Mark Manduca, aviation analyst at Citi.
Companies are reassessing their travel policies. Jean-Sébastien Jacques, chief executive of Rio Tinto, said its 
spending on long-haul air travel could fall by as much as 75 per cent over the next six months. "We used to have a 
big budget for international travel between continents, and I am sure that is going to shrink very quickly."
Mr Nigam thinks carriers may need to think creatively about boosting profits, from introducing subscription services 
to bigger premium economy cabins, allowing people to distance while paying a little more than economy class. 
"There will be some impact ... if everyone's enjoying being on Zoom videos," Ed Bastian, Delta head, said last 
month. "I personally don't, but maybe some people do. Maybe that will change the nature of travel a bit. But 
business is done face to face. People enjoy experiences. All the things we've seen ... actually have, in my opinion, 
caused people to miss travel more than ever before in this lockdown phase. And we'll get back." Additional

May 25, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Just as many European countries 
are starting to open up again, the United Kingdom announced plans to introduce a 14-day quarantine for travellers 
arriving from abroad. Interior minister Priti Patel said that, from June 8, all international arrivals, including returning 
Britons, will have to self-isolate and provide details of where they will be staying. The rules will not apply to Ireland, 
which has a free-movement agreement with the UK. Freight drivers, medical professionals and seasonal 
agricultural workers[1] will also be excluded. Those breaking the rules would face a $1,220 fine or prosecution, the 
government warned. 'Now we are past the peak of this virus, we must take steps to guard against imported cases 
triggering a resurgence of this deadly disease', Patel said at a news conference. The plan was condemned by 
airlines, business groups and politicians. Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary accused ministers of making the quarantine 
plan up as they go along. Others have questioned why Britain did not introduce quarantine during the worst of the 
country's coronavirus outbreak. Arriving passengers will also be 'encouraged' to download a contact-tracing app[2] 
that authorities are developing, and are hoping to have it in place by June. [ 1]:

page has been deleted. The moat could use some work, but the growth prospects look decentQuality-focused 
investors may see Eastern Europe as barren land, as it can be challenging to find businesses generating high cash 
returns and growing organically at a steady pace. 
However, Poland-based LiveChat Software (WAR:LVC[1]) appears to be an exemption. We at Urbem have 
researched the customer service software developer, which operates in the Software-as-a-Service model and 
enables its clients to better connect with their customers, increase online sales and improve online conversions. 
Take a look at LiveChat's financial performance, which shows an over 100% return on equity capital or invested 
capital (including cash), an operating margin of more than 60%, a free cash flow margin of more than 40%, no debt, 
plenty of liquidity on the balance sheet and a three-year revenue growth rate of 27%. According to data from 
GuruFocus, the business consistently delivered super-normal returns on assets while increasing its annual free 
cash flow by more than five times since its IPO in 2014.LiveChat's main product is a tool for quick contact between 
customers and businesses using a text-based chat feature embedded on the website or application. Around this 
core use case, the company has built 'widgets,' including ChatBot (an AI-driven platform to automate business 
communication), HelpDesk (a support ticketing system) and KnowledgeBase (a self-service help center). Across 
the top one million websites worldwide, LiveChat captures around 10% of the market share, which is second to the 
market leader Zendesk's (NYSE:ZEN[2]) 27% and the runner-up tawk.io's 15%. By geographies, North America, 
the UK and Australia account for 47%, 13% and 7% of the total revenue, respectively. The domestic market only 
generates 2% of the company's sales. Prominent clients include Adobe, McDonald's, Mercedes-Benz, Paypal, 
Samsung, Huawei, Ryanair and Sony, although the management believes that its products are addressed primarily 
to small- and medium-sized enterprises. LiveChat is a truly global company serving global businesses with scale. 
Moving forward, the company plans to concentrate on the organic acquisition of new clients. Per the management, 
the customer acquisition cost is close to zero, thanks to the robust business model. This means that the company 
can return most of its earnings to owners, with a dividend payout ratio consistently above 70% since the IPO. 
Meanwhile, we believe that the continuous increase in online retail sales globally will drive the growth of the live 
chat software category. This means that live chat software developers would be focusing more on acquiring new 
clients rather than fighting for clients from competitors, at least for the short run. Over the longer term, it cannot be 
LiveChat Software: A Rare Quality Story From Eastern Europe
ruled out that the competition will get increasingly fierce. We have observed the loss-leading approach that delivers 
a higher growth at Zendesk as well as the threat from freemium players, including the late entrant tawk.io. In the live 
chat software space, companies mainly compete in terms of quality, features and security, none of which appears 
to be able to act as a sustainable competitive edge. LiveChat has been working actively on building its ecosystem 
around the core product. The strategy may work out well with respect to increasing client stickiness and the 
associated switching cost. In this regard, we hope to see a clearer sign of economic moat in the future. LiveChat is 
still founder-led, with aggregate insider ownership of around 47% among founders and key managers. Although the 
current moat of the business is not visible enough to us, the industry where it operates benefits significantly from 
the long-term tailwind of digitalization, and the company's business model proves solid with a balance of both high 
returns and high growth. We think that LiveChat Software can be a good candidate as a quality compounder, which 
makes it worth a slot on the watch list. Disclosure: The mention of any security in this article does not constitute an

M any of the world's grounded airlines are receiving lavish government funding. The French and Dutch 
governments are giving Air France-KLM about (EURO)10bn. Dubai is injecting new equity into Emirates. The US is 
providing its airlines with $25bn of support.
But there is another group that has been even more generous. It includes me, possibly you and millions of others 
who paid for flights that were then cancelled because of Covid-19 and who are now struggling to get refunds. 
Together, we have made an involuntary, no-interest, unsecured loan to the world's airlines.
How much have we lent? Alexandre de Juniac, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, says 
we have paid $35bn for flights that cannot now take place. The law is clear. We are entitled to our money. If our 
flight was meant to start or end in the EU, the UK, Switzerland, Iceland or Norway we are owed a refund. The US 
Department of Transportation says, too, that if your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to get your money back, 
even for tickets that were sold on the basis that they were not refundable. In the US and the UK, consumers and 
lawyers have launched or are thinking of starting legal action to recover their money.
Yet worldwide, many airlines are doing everything they can to avoid shelling out. A common tactic is to push 
passengers to accept vouchers instead of cash. In the UK, Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, the consumer 
journal, credits easyJet and Jet2 with helping customers with refunds, but he points to Ryanair and British Airways 
as trying to slip out of their obligations.
Michael Skapinker Business travel
BA allows customers to claim a voucher online but makes them phone to claim a refund. Boland said Which? had 
received complaints from customers unable to get through to BA on the phone. An FT reader emailed me that he 
had been trying for nearly two weeks.
Then there are airlines that make refunds look easy but hang on to the money. Before the crisis, I had booked a 
Singapore Airlines return ticket to Australia. When the flight was cancelled, I went on to the Singapore website, 
swiftly located the refund button and provided my details. Three weeks later I phoned the airline's call centre to ask 
how my refund was getting on. I had no trouble getting through to a polite customer service person who confirmed 
that my request was being processed. When would I get my money? He couldn't say. Weeks, months, years? 
Sorry, can't tell you.
There's a good reason for the airlines' recalcitrance, of course. Many are on the verge of bankruptcy. De Juniac 
said they employed 2.7m people directly. A further 65.5m worked in the aviation value chain. Many are losing their 
jobs. Airlines need to conserve their cash. But customers have cash needs too. So do businesses whose staff were 
booked to fly.
That airlines might go bust adds to the consumer worry. If they do, what are those vouchers worth? And if you were 
waiting for a cash refund, what are your chances of getting it? The European Commission last week suggested 
airlines make vouchers more attractive. They should consider offering vouchers worth more than the refund. 
Passengers should be allowed to transfer their vouchers to someone else. Vouchers should be valid for at least 12 
months and, if unused at the end of that time, should be automatically redeemable for cash. Governments or the 
private sector should set up a scheme to guarantee the voucher's value if the airline went out of business.
The EU hasn't performed gloriously through the coronavirus crisis; its members have been cantankerous and self-
serving. But these are constructive proposals. They provide some hope that the airlines' unwilling creditors may 
eventually be compensated for the flights they booked.

flight was meant to start or end in the EU, the UK, Switzerland, Iceland or Norway we are owed a refund. The US 
Department of Transportation says, too, that if your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to get your money back, 
even for tickets that were sold on the basis that they were not refundable. In the US and the UK, consumers and 
lawyers have launched or are thinking of starting legal action to recover their money.
Yet worldwide, many airlines are doing everything they can to avoid shelling out. A common tactic is to push 
passengers to accept vouchers instead of cash. In the UK, Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, the consumer 
journal, credits easyJet and Jet2 with helping customers with refunds, but he points to Ryanair and British Airways 
as trying to slip out of their obligations.

BA allows customers to claim a voucher online but makes them phone to claim a refund. Boland said Which? had 
received complaints from customers unable to get through to BA on the phone. An FT reader emailed me that he 
had been trying for nearly two weeks.
Then there are airlines that make refunds look easy but hang on to the money. Before the crisis, I had booked a 
Singapore Airlines return ticket to Australia. When the flight was cancelled, I went on to the Singapore website, 
swiftly located the refund button and provided my details. Three weeks later I phoned the airline's call centre to ask 
how my refund was getting on. I had no trouble getting through to a polite customer service person who confirmed 
that my request was being processed. When would I get my money? He couldn't say. Weeks, months, years? 
Sorry, can't tell you.
There's a good reason for the airlines' recalcitrance, of course. Many are on the verge of bankruptcy. De Juniac 
said they employed 2.7m people directly. A further 65.5m worked in the aviation value chain. Many are losing their 
jobs. Airlines need to conserve their cash. But customers have cash needs too. So do businesses whose staff were 
booked to fly.
That airlines might go bust adds to the consumer worry. If they do, what are those vouchers worth? And if you were 
waiting for a cash refund, what are your chances of getting it? The European Commission last week suggested 
airlines make vouchers more attractive. They should consider offering vouchers worth more than the refund. 
Passengers should be allowed to transfer their vouchers to someone else. Vouchers should be valid for at least 12 
months and, if unused at the end of that time, should be automatically redeemable for cash. Governments or the 
private sector should set up a scheme to guarantee the voucher's value if the airline went out of business.
The EU hasn't performed gloriously through the coronavirus crisis; its members have been cantankerous and self-
serving. But these are constructive proposals. They provide some hope that the airlines' unwilling creditors may 
eventually be compensated for the flights they booked.

Emirates plans for jet fleet's full return to skies in 2022 The president of Emirates expects to have all its planes 
flying in two years' time, including its A380 superjumbos.
Tim Clark, who heads the Dubai-based carrier, said its fleet of A380s, which will cease to be manufactured from 
next year, would continue to play an important part in the airline's future.
Sir Tim said the carrier, one of the world's largest, was planning to fully deploy all its aircraft in the summer of 2022 
based on its outlook for a recovery in air travel to take up to two years.
It comes as other airlines also laid out their recovery plans this month, with British Airways owner IAG forecasting it 
would take three years before passenger demand returned to normal. Ryanair plans to resume about 40 per cent of 
its flights in July.
Sir Tim dismissed suggestions that Emirates would permanently decommission a large part of its 115-strong A380 
fleet. "At the moment, I've got 115 sitting there. We've always known that up until that point in time ... in 2022 there 
are going to be a number that will have to go into long-term storage."
He added: "We're not getting rid of any of them apart from three that are coming out and nine 777s that were 
scheduled to come out this year."
Emirates plans for jet fleet's [...] Airlines
The A380 had a "place in the Emirates international network on the scale it has before", he said. "Albeit not today or 
fully next year, but the year after I think there will be a place for it, and I think it is going to be extremely popular."
His comments came days after Air France announced a (EURO)500m writedown as it said it would permanently 
withdraw its fleet of nine A380s. Last year Airbus announced plans to stop making the 550-seat double-decker in 
2021 following poor sales. It has eight to build for Emirates. Sir Tim would not comment on speculation the carrier 
might cancel this order although he acknowledged it was in talks with Airbus.
Emirates this week became the latest airline to tentatively restart a small number of routes, including Australia to 
UK, after halting its regular operations since the end of March after widespread lockdowns and travel restrictions 
worldwide.

General retailers SELL Marks and Spencer (MKS) S) Even without the impact of the lockdown, the retail group is 
still struggling to adapt to a fast-evolving retail environment Marks and Spencer's clothing business set the retailer 
back once more at the March yearend, with difficulties in transitioning its menswear range through the second half 
coming on top of availability problems in womenswear during the first.
Clothing and home operating profits slumped by 37 per cent to £224m, with the division's operating profit margin 
squeezed to 7 per cent from 10.1 per cent last year. M&S's food arm had a stronger year, posting operating profit 
growth of 11.2 per cent to £237m.
The clothing and home division has sustained the hcan heaviest impact from coronavirus within the group, and 
M&S is now modelling for a 70 per cent fall in revenues here in the four months to July, with a gradual return to 
normal levels by February 2021. This will hit annual turnover by around £1.5bn.
M&S has written down £157m of inventories in response to the pandemic, £145m of which sat within its clothing 
and home arm. The retailer will put aside around £200m worth of its unsold seasonal stock until spring 2021 and 
carry forward £400m of year-round basic product, which will increase its stock carrying levels.
Of the retailer's £336m in adjustments to statutory profits, £213m related to Covid-19, while £49.2m was linked to 
the impairment of stores and goodwill.

but much depends on the duration of Europe's travel restrictions Ryanair expects to record a (EURO)200m (£178m) 
loss in its first quarter as a result of the recent collapse in aviation traffic.
Most of the airline's fleet has been glued to the tarmac since mid-March and regardless of whether some flights are 
restored in July, the knock-on effects of the pandemic have been calamitous.
The low-cost carrier anticipates carrying about 80m passengers over its 2021 financial year, well down on the the 
154m travellers it had targeted for the period.
Groundings in the period under review cut full-year traffic by 5m passengers, constraining pre-tax profits by more 
than (EURO)40m. However, trading patterns before the lockdown were encouraging.
pa we The group experienced a 10 per cent sales lift over its full-year, driven by a combination of traffic growth, fare 
increases and a 20 per cent jump in ancillary revenues, as more passengers opted for priority boarding and 
preferred seat services. But the airline's overall pre-tax profits sustained a (EURO)353m blow linked to its 2021 fuel 
hedges, as the price of crude collapsed due to a sharp fall in global demand and inaction on production cuts.
Ryanair took swift action to keep on top of the high costs of being grounded with almost no income, and has cut its 
average weekly cash burn from (EURO)200m to (EURO)60m. It is negotiating with partners to reduce new airplane 
deliveries.
It has also suspended share buybacks, having returned (EURO)581m to shareholders over its 2020 full-year. Alex

M&S is now modelling for a 70 per cent fall in revenues here in the four months to July, with a gradual return to 
normal levels by February 2021. This will hit annual turnover by around £1.5bn.
M&S has written down £157m of inventories in response to the pandemic, £145m of which sat within its clothing 
and home arm. The retailer will put aside around £200m worth of its unsold seasonal stock until spring 2021 and 
carry forward £400m of year-round basic product, which will increase its stock carrying levels.
Of the retailer's £336m in adjustments to statutory profits, £213m related to Covid-19, while £49.2m was linked to 
the impairment of stores and goodwill.

Most of the airline's fleet has been glued to the tarmac since mid-March and regardless of whether some flights are

The low-cost carrier anticipates carrying about 80m passengers over its 2021 financial year, well down on the the 
154m travellers it had targeted for the period.

Ryanair took swift action to keep on top of the high costs of being grounded with almost no income, and has cut its 
average weekly cash burn from (EURO)200m to (EURO)60m. It is negotiating with partners to reduce new airplane

It has also suspended share buybacks, having returned (EURO)581m to shareholders over its 2020 full-year. Alex

The chief executive of British Airways has hit out at two big unions for failing to attend any of its consultation 
meetings over the airline's plans to cut up to 30 per cent of its 42,000-strong workforce.
In a letter to staff yesterday, Alex Cruz said that, while the airline had started productive conversations with the 
pilots' union Balpa, both Unite and GMB had so far failed to attend any of the meetings.
He wrote: "Consultation is so important, and productive conversations are already being held with Balpa.
"I am sorry that neither Unite nor GMB have attended any of the daily meetings they are invited to, so that they can 
provide ideas and input into any of the other proposed changes and maximise the number of jobs saved."
In the letter, Mr Cruz warned that BA's "financial situation is not improving". The government's announcement of a 
14-day quarantine for UK incoming passengers starting in June "deals another blow to our chances of starting the 
recovery phase".
It comes as Unite general secretary Len McCluskey wrote to the board members of IAG, British Airways' owner, 
warning that it was launching a public campaign to highlight the "deplorable actions" taken by BA in its move to axe 
up to 12,000 staff and change employees' terms and conditions.
BA chief criticises unions for not attending talks on job cuts ? Cruz warns over grim outlook for sector ? Unite 
brands consultation a 'sham'
In response to its absence from meetings, Howard Beckett, assistant general secretary at Unite, said: "The law 
requires BA to meaningfully consult with Unite and allow the union access to the workforce. That is impossible 
when the workforce is furloughed under a scheme that specifically precludes employees from working."
"British Airways is opportunistically going through the motions in the knowledge that meaningful negotiations cannot 
occur.
"Unite believes that BA is acting unlawfully, and when its sham consultation exercise is complete the union will 
undertake legal action on behalf of its members."
GMB declined to comment. Last month IAG was one of the first big airline groups to announce job cuts as it warned 
that a return to 2019 passenger levels would take "several years". Ryanair is planning to axe up to 15 per cent of its 
staff while Virgin Atlantic is cutting about a third of its 10,000-strong workforce.
Unite has called on BA to remove its redundancy threat by lifting its Section 188 notice - which paves the way for 
consultation and is triggered when an employer proposes to make redundant 20 or more jobs - and engage in 
"meaningful" talks.
In his letter to IAG board members, Mr McCluskey wrote: "If you were remotely serious about entering into 
meaningful consultation and negotiation, you would by now have lifted the threat of the 188 notice and given time 
and space for real discussions.
"If this is really all about the Covid-19 crisis, why have you refused to suggest or accept any temporary measures 
with joint reviews, so that terms and conditions would be returned as revenue climbs? In truth, you have imposed 
this without any intention of negotiating."
The union said its public campaign aimed to alert BA's customers, shareholders and partners of the "severe and 
permanent damage being done at a time of national crisis".

View original post here[2]. Authored by Bill Blain via MorningPorridge.com,[3]  'The two aims of the Party are to 
conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought.'  40 
million unemployed Americans. Pretty powerful piece of BBC reporting last night on 5-hour queues for upstate NY 
middle class food banks. 'These people have now missed 5 or 6 paychecks and they need to eat', said a charity 
worker. 
A protestor demanding reopening screamed into a microphone:'What is the point in saving people from coronavirus 
and then letting them starve instead?' America looks divided.  It's not just them. The mood is getting uglier. A chum 
at a leading investment firm has just been quietly told he won't be getting paid the bonus he expected - it been 
worded as deferral, but looks permanent. He says he puffed up and cited his rights but got brutally slapped down: 
told he's lucky to have a job, and if he complains or says anything he's on furlough and out the door immediately 
thereafter. He's terrified. He's highly levered, has school fees to pay, and feels trapped. It's made a bad social 
situation worse, stuck in a small London house with kids and a now very unhappy wife.  Repeat the same scenario 
some 20 million times around the globe - as the upper middle classes are 'disciplined'. Job losses are accumulating 
across the global economy. But don't worry, your Pension plan, Super or 401 is doing just fine for now  A 
particularly cynical client reckons rising fear and job losses are as positive a reason to buy stocks as any he's 
heard. Companies are grabbing the virus opportunity to rationalise, cut headcount, cut wages, and axe extraneous 
departments. As a result; bottom lines are improving as they become more efficient and productive! Everyone 
expects 2nd and 3rd quarter earning wipe-outs, but this is 'capitalism in action' and earnings could surprise to the 
upside as costs as slashed.  When I commented y'day about the importance of 'Social' in ESG investing I was 
branded a communist on the website.You can call me a complete Bolshevik; but companies planning to slash 
payroll to increase dividends in this landscape deserve strung up. Sadly.. it will happen. I guess we better get used 
to it. Have you read 1984?  Meanwhile, Lufthansa is finally going to get its $9 bln German govt bailout. Emirates are 
looking to retire their A-380s. Ryanair expects passengers will flout quarantine rules and take holidays abroad 
anyway I can just imagine:2 weeks in Marbs followed by 3 months in the Costa Scrubs.  But the first order news this 
morning is all about China    This morning the Chinese sent a signal round the globe when they didn't set a target 
for economic growth for the first time in 30 years. The reality is the People's Central Committee doesn't want to 
reveal anything that hints at just how bad the economic reality is in China.  There are all kinds of theories about 
'The Mood Is Getting Uglier' And China's Not Helping
China - you have to cut thru them to focus on what's real. Some say China is on a deliberate collision course with 
the US. It's the end of the US empire as China becomes the new pre-eminent global superpower. A trade war with 
the US could soon turn into a hot war. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Sith China Seas and the Spratlys are 
flashpoints set to ignite. A slowing China/ the Virus is a weapon of deliberate economic warfare because of the 
damage and instability it will create across the West. Etc, etc  The bottom line is China also suffers. I suspect the 
truth is the Communist party knows it's in serious trouble honouring its compact with the people - keep them happy, 
make them rich and they don't care who's in power. The compact looks wobbly. This is going to be a massive test 
for China, and the chances of collateral damage are huge as its responses impact global trade, destabilise 
overseas entanglements and lead to conflict in international organisations where China and the US face each other.  
Whatever I say about China, I bet I get called a shill or an agipropbot of the PCC for even suggesting the Chinese 
might love their children too.  The party would like us to believe China can achieve a face-saving V-Shaped 
recovery - but it looks unlikely. The economy took a massive hit (industrial production only recovered 4% in April 
after a 13.5% crash over Q1). 20% of the migrant workers who assemble everything from iPhones to Electric 
Scooters never returned to work. The domestic debt markets are as perilous as anywhere else.  While workers in 
the state sector are protected - it's a declining piece of the Chinese economy. It's been the Chinese private sector 
that's driven growth, and it's in exactly the same place as the rest of the global economy: being forced to shutter 
production and layoff workers - to a far greater extent than officials will admit. Incomes are falling, consumption is 
waning, and folk are focused on keeping what they have.  The issue for China is how to get the private sector 
working again before unemployment and declining wealth causes a social issue. They can no more afford a trade 
war with the west crippling any domestic recovery.Which is why the Chinese also announced this morning their 
intention to implement the new trade deal with the US.That's a big de-escalation, but a gesture they had to make. 
It's a big risk strategy that could embarrass the party - the main one being just how fast and loose will Trump play 
with new threats and demands in this election year.  The trade deal news has to weighed against the potential 
damageimplementation of National Security Law in Hong Kong - also announced this morning.That is bound to 
trigger a new wave of protests and revulsion across the West. The party has done it because it's a good unifier 
domestically. If there is one thing the Party has done well, its to have created a very patriotic nation where these 
terrible Hong Kong Western Stooges have made the ultimate insults to the flag and anthem, thus they are class 
enemies and must be purged.  And if disciplining Hong Kong doesn't unite the people.. then there is always the 
convenient lie about the patriotic duty to restore Taiwan to the motherland. (The truth is Taiwan was never really 
part of China except briefly - it could well become China's Troubled Ireland if it ever does..)  All of which means XI 
has raised the stakes. If the government can't deliver wealth and prosperity - social unrest and wider democracy 
calls become a real possibility. He needs to reopen trade to do that.  Interestingly, it's clear the Party does take the 
people seriously - unlike the final days of the Soviet empire in the 1980s. One of the reasons China has become 
such a strong proponent of renewable energy and EVs is its scarred environment - the result of 50 years of 
industrial growth imperatives and coal power which did enormous environmental damage, poisoning the landscape, 
water course and public health. It's a factor the government is now addressing to maintain its social compact.  This 
is going to be an interesting weekend in terms of how the China story plays out. Although the immediate market 
reaction has been negative, avoiding a global trade war would be a massive real positive development. [ 1]:

 The UK government plans to impose 1,000 pounds sterling ($1,217) fines on international travelers who fail to self-
isolate for 14 days after landing in the UK, effective early June, Sky News reported on Friday citing sources.
Under the measure, travelers including returning locals will be required to share their contact details and health 
officials will perform spot checks to ensure compliance.
The new restrictions will not be applicable to medical officials and the common travel area with Ireland will be 
unaffected as well. France and Australia entered into talks for a potential exemption from the new rule.
However, Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary called the plan as "idiotic" and 
"implementable" and Airlines UK warned that the quarantine measures "would effectively kill" international travel to 
and from the UK.
Despite the rules, Ryanair plans to resume 40% of its flights, starting July 1, with British Airways scheduled to 
resume operations in July as well, Sky News added.
Ryanair Holdings' shares fell marginally on Friday morning.

May 22, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Britain is to 
introduce a quarantine period of 14 days for those arriving in the UK, Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis 
confirmed Friday and said ministers would give details later."People who are coming to the UK will have to do 
quarantine," Lewis told Sky news, saying the new rules would cover British citizens and those from 
elsewhere."We're saying to people you've got to make your own arrangements, if you're coming to the UK then you 
need to make those arrangements."Obviously for the UK citizens coming back they'll be able to quarantine at home, 
for visitors they will need to make arrangements for here they can do that quarantine for 14 days."The plans are 
expected to come into force next month and further details would be outlined on Friday by Home Secretary Priti 
Patel at the daily Downing Street briefing.Lewis said the policy would be reviewed every three weeks.There are 
expected to be exemptions for road hauliers and medical officials, while the common travel area with Ireland will be 
unaffected. A 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals in Britain is coming under fire from airlines Photo: AFP /

month there would be an exemption.The move is likely to prove controversial, especially among the aviation 
sector.Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary earlier this week branded a proposed quarantine plan "idiotic" while trade 
body Airlines UK has said it "would effectively kill" international travel to the UK.There has been criticism within the 
UK about the lack of a quarantine while other countries such as South Korea, Spain and the US did impose such a 
restriction, while others are questioning why the measures are being imposed now.Geneticist and Nobel Prize 
winner Sir Paul Nurse criticised the government on Friday when asked about the introduction of a quarantine 
period."The UK has been rather too much on the back foot, increasingly playing catch-up, firefighting," he told the

Ryanair subsidiary Lauda is to close its base at Vienna's airport following a dispute with a trade union, the company 
said on Friday.
Some 300 jobs will be affected, the airline said. It had recently given the Vida union an ultimatum to sign a new 
collective agreement with significant wage cuts for employees due to the coronavirus crisis.
As the union refused, the base will be closed on May 29, the statement said.
"In a shameful way, the union Vida ignored the wishes of more than 95 per cent of the pilots and 70 per cent of the 
cabin crew at Lauda's A320 base in Vienna and destroyed more than 300 well-paid jobs," Lauda bosses Andreas 
Gruber and David O'Brien were quoted as saying.
Vida on the other hand described Ryanair and Austria's Economic Chamber as "gravediggers" of living wages. The 
chamber had spoken out in favour of signing the wage deal.
According to the airline, the new agreement would have given junior cabin crew an average annual income of 
24,450 euros (26,650 dollars), a captain would have earned about 117,000 euros. Vida talked about a monthly net 
wage of 848 euros for newly hired flight attendants.
The Vienna base is by far the largest base of the Ryanair subsidiary, which currently has a fleet of 26 aircraft. The 
aircraft are grounded due to the pandemic.

May 22, 2020( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  Britain is 
to introduce a quarantine period of 14 days for those arriving in the UK, Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis 
confirmed Friday and said ministers would give details later. "People who are coming to the UK will have to do 
quarantine," Lewis told Sky news, saying the new rules would cover British citizens and those from elsewhere. 
"We're saying to people you've got to make your own arrangements, if you're coming to the UK then you need to 
make those arrangements. "Obviously for the UK citizens coming back they'll be able to quarantine at home, for 
visitors they will need to make arrangements for here they can do that quarantine for 14 days." The plans are 
expected to come into force next month and further details would be outlined on Friday by Home Secretary Priti 
Patel at the daily Downing Street briefing. Lewis said the policy would be reviewed every three weeks. There are 
expected to be exemptions for road hauliers and medical officials, while the common travel area with Ireland will be 
unaffected. But it is thought that arrivals from France will have to quarantine, despite claims earlier this month there 
would be an exemption. The move is likely to prove controversial, especially among the aviation sector. Ryanair 
boss Michael O'Leary earlier this week branded a proposed quarantine plan "idiotic" while trade body Airlines UK 
has said it "would effectively kill" international travel to the UK. There has been criticism within the UK about the 
lack of a quarantine while other countries such as South Korea, Spain and the US did impose such a restriction, 
while others are questioning why the measures are being imposed now. Geneticist and Nobel Prize winner Sir Paul 
Nurse criticised the government on Friday when asked about the introduction of a quarantine period. "The UK has 
been rather too much on the back foot, increasingly playing catch-up, firefighting," he told the BBC. He added: "We 
are desperate for clear leadership at all levels."

Idiotic. Unimplementable. Just two of the words Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary used about the UK government's 
idea to impose a 14-day quarantine on returning travellers.
Other airline bosses are taking their cue from the irate Irishman. Willie Walsh, who had been aiming to increase 
British Airways flights to 1,000 a day from July, said the airline would have to review its plans downwards. EasyJet's 
plans to resume some flying from June 15, announced yesterday, are mainly for domestic flights within the UK and 
France.
It's a reminder of how closely public health policy is entwined with any recovery in airline traffic.
Now the European aviation body, Easa, has come out with a set of Covid-19 guidelines for reopening the airways. 
Passenger temperature-taking in airports is encouraged. So is physical distancing, including on aircraft where 
possible. The result - empty seats between passengers, and only filling every other row - would be to cut maximum 
capacity to 33 per cent.
Airline bosses may huff and puff as aircraft sit idle. But the key thing will be giving confidence to passengers not 
only to buy tickets (at potentially much higher prices), but to spend extended times in airports (seen as vectors of 
infection) to travel.
A study by Chris Tarry, an aviation analyst, suggests passengers are prepared to put up with some inconvenience. 
Some 46 per cent were prepared to accept a four-hour check-in time, with 11 per cent prepared to go to five hours. 
Airway obstruction 12. FINANCIAL TIMES COMPANIES & MARKETS
But many will take coaxing. Almost 25 per cent would wait for four to six months before resuming flying after 
restrictions were lifted, with 15 per cent hanging back for at least a year.
And how easy will these rules be to administer? Imagine being the airline staff member who has to turn a family of 
five away from the gate (and their holiday) because one of them has a temperature. Mr Tarry says: "I predict a riot."
For all Mr O'Leary's frustration, there is no quick answer. European traffic was down 90 per cent, year on year, 
according to Eurocontrol. Mr Tarry believes the quickest segment to recover when restrictions are relaxed will be 
travellers visiting relatives. This isn't huge, accounting for roughly 8 per cent of UK passenger movements.
Airlines have a strong motivation to normalise travel and preserve infrastructure by restarting services.
But, for now, investors should not bank on anything except the whiff of more burning cash.

EasyJet has announced plans to restart a small number of flights in the middle of June, which will initially involve 
the low-cost airline flying domestic routes in the UK and France.
The budget carrier yesterday said it would add further routes as customer demand increased and lockdown 
measures across Europe were relaxed.
EasyJet's plan comes as airlines and airports are tentatively looking at resuming flights in the coming months. 
Dubai-based Emirates is restarting a select number of long-haul flights, including the UK to Australia, while Ryanair 
intends to resume about 40 per cent of its capacity from July.
In India, aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri has tweeted that domestic operations will "recommence in a 
calibrated manner" from May 25. Separately, London's Heathrow airport yesterday started a trial of temperature 
screening checks on passengers arriving at Terminal 2 as it looks at ways of restoring confidence in air travel.
Johan Lundgren, easyJet chief executive, said of the plan to begin flights on June 15: "These are small and 
carefully planned steps that we are taking to gradually resume operations."
EasyJet plans cautious return to the skies Airlines ; Budget carrier gears up for mid-June relaunch of 189 flights 
a week
EasyJet will initially operate about 189 flights a week, compared with a precoronavirus level of more than 12,000. 
As well as domestic flights in the UK and France, it will also operate a small number of international routes from 
Geneva, Lisbon, Porto and Barcelona.
The move comes at a difficult time for the low-cost carrier. On Tuesday, it revealed that it had been targeted in a 
cyber attack, with the email addresses and travel details of about 9m customers breached. Its investigation also 
found that about 2,200 customers had their credit card details stolen.
It is also in the middle of a battle with its founder and largest shareholder Stelios Haji-Ioannou over a 
multibillionpound order for 107 Airbus aircraft. The airline is holding a meeting today in response to Sir Stelios's 
resolution to remove four directors, including Mr Lundgren and chairman John Barton.
The airline also announced health measures designed to restore consumer confidence in air travel. These include 
customers and staff being required to wear masks, enhanced cleaning of its aircraft, and temporarily halting its 
onboard food service.
The move comes as the European Aviation Safety Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and 
Control late on Wednesday published a set of joint guidelines for a safe resumption of air travel.
This includes the wearing of face masks, physical distancing of 1.5 metres where possible at airports, and the 
frequent washing of hands.

Johan Lundgren, easyJet chief executive, said of the plan to begin flights on June 15: "These are small and 
carefully planned steps that we are taking to gradually resume operations."
EasyJet plans cautious return to the skies Airlines ; Budget carrier gears up for mid-June relaunch of 189 flights 
a week
EasyJet will initially operate about 189 flights a week, compared with a precoronavirus level of more than 12,000. 
As well as domestic flights in the UK and France, it will also operate a small number of international routes from 
Geneva, Lisbon, Porto and Barcelona.
The move comes at a difficult time for the low-cost carrier. On Tuesday, it revealed that it had been targeted in a 
cyber attack, with the email addresses and travel details of about 9m customers breached. Its investigation also 
found that about 2,200 customers had their credit card details stolen.
It is also in the middle of a battle with its founder and largest shareholder Stelios Haji-Ioannou over a 
multibillionpound order for 107 Airbus aircraft. The airline is holding a meeting today in response to Sir Stelios's 
resolution to remove four directors, including Mr Lundgren and chairman John Barton.
The airline also announced health measures designed to restore consumer confidence in air travel. These include 
customers and staff being required to wear masks, enhanced cleaning of its aircraft, and temporarily halting its 
onboard food service.
The move comes as the European Aviation Safety Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and 
Control late on Wednesday published a set of joint guidelines for a safe resumption of air travel.
This includes the wearing of face masks, physical distancing of 1.5 metres where possible at airports, and the 
frequent washing of hands.

EasyJet has announced plans to restart a small number of flights in the middle of June, which will initially involve 
the low-cost airline flying domestic routes in the UK and France.
The budget carrier yesterday said it would add further routes as customer demand increased and lockdown 
measures across Europe were relaxed.
EasyJet's plan comes as airlines and airports are tentatively looking at resuming flights in the coming months. 
Dubai-based Emirates is restarting a select number of long-haul flights, including the UK to Australia, while Ryanair 
intends to resume about 40 per cent of its capacity from July.
In India, aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri has tweeted that domestic operations will "recommence in a 
calibrated manner" from May 25. Separately, London's Heathrow airport yesterday started a trial of temperature 
screening checks on passengers arriving at Terminal 2 as it looks at ways of restoring confidence in air travel.
Johan Lundgren, easyJet chief executive, said of the plan to begin flights on June 15: "These are small and

Highlight: Travellers itching to explore again will be thrilled with the news that flight schedules are gradually 
resuming. However, they could be discouraged by higher fares and arduous air travel processes.
Body
New hygiene measures will lengthen the airport processAs major airlines are resuming flights across the world, 
questions have arisen about how it will continue with social distancing and hygiene measures that are now in 
everyday life. In India, domestic flights are permitted, with a long list of instructions in tow. Passengers must 
download a government tracing app, agree to thermal screening for temperature checks, in some cases provide 
health certificates and wear appropriate protective equipment such as face masks and gloves, to be able to travel 
within the country. 
Flights to larger cities such as Mumbai and Delhi could take longer to resume due to the risks present. These 
measures will be difficult to implement at a uniformed standard across global airports. The number of flights per day 
could have to decrease due to terminal building capacitates shrinking with social distancing measures now in place, 
while new procedures within the terminal building will have to be installed, along with education for passengers on 
the 'new normal' when travelling. New terminal measures may mean longer queues and wait times, so a relaxing air 
travel experience could be something of the past. The time at which passengers are required to arrive at an airport 
could be earlier, such as two to three hours before departure, disrupting travellers' schedules and could cause 
travellers to miss flights if they have not adhered to the new airport rules. Getting rid of the middle seat is not 
financially viableIn order to help with social distancing measures on an aircraft, European airline easyJet 
announced that it would not be selling tickets for the middle seat upon its aircraft. Although this may be good news 
for passengers and social distancing rules, competing airline Ryanair commented that it will not be financially viable 
for its own airline. Not selling tickets for the middle seat will cut 33% of revenues, something which is not feasible 
for airlines who are currently struggling with immense cash burn and dramatic drops in revenue. There is hope for 
passengers that the initial lack of demand, while restrictions are still in place, will allow for social distancing to be 
possible on an aircraft. Increased fares may be likelyAs airlines are making every effort to try and get back on their 
feet following the global shutdown of travel, they will have to look for opportunities in order to raise extra revenue 
With longer queues, temperature checks and mandatory face masks, air travel will not be the same
that has been lost during this period. Airlines should look to refigure fare structures, including charging for legroom 
seats and baggage if they do not already do so, in order for flights to increase profit. Fares that have increased too 
much will detract consumers from returning to travel just yet. There is no doubt that those with cancelled bookings 
and travel vouchers will want to fly soon. However, tighter recession-hit budgets could not be big enough to foot the 
probable higher bill of future travel.

May 22, 2020( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  Britain is to introduce a 
quarantine period of 14 days for those arriving in the UK, Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis confirmed 
Friday and said ministers would give details later."People who are coming to the UK will have to do quarantine," 
Lewis told Sky news, saying the new rules would cover British citizens and those from elsewhere."We're saying to 
people you've got to make your own arrangements, if you're coming to the UK then you need to make those 
arrangements."Obviously for the UK citizens coming back they'll be able to quarantine at home, for visitors they will 
need to make arrangements for here they can do that quarantine for 14 days."The plans are expected to come into 
force next month and further details would be outlined on Friday by Home Secretary Priti Patel at the daily Downing 
Street briefing.Lewis said the policy would be reviewed every three weeks.There are expected to be exemptions for 
road hauliers and medical officials, while the common travel area with Ireland will be unaffected. But it is thought 
that arrivals from France will have to quarantine, despite claims earlier this month there would be an exemption.The 
move is likely to prove controversial, especially among the aviation sector.Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary earlier this 
week branded a proposed quarantine plan "idiotic" while trade body Airlines UK has said it "would effectively kill" 
international travel to the UK.There has been criticism within the UK about the lack of a quarantine while other 
countries such as South Korea, Spain and the US did impose such a restriction, while others are questioning why 
the measures are being imposed now.Geneticist and Nobel Prize winner Sir Paul Nurse criticised the government 
on Friday when asked about the introduction of a quarantine period."The UK has been rather too much on the back 
foot, increasingly playing catch-up, firefighting," he told the BBC.He added: "We are desperate for clear leadership 
at all levels."

Ryanair's Austrian airline Lauda on Friday said it would shut down its main Vienna base on May 29 with the loss of 
more than 300 jobs in Austria after it did not manage to agree new labour contracts with the union.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said earlier in May that the group would shut down the main Vienna base of Lauda 
and bring in Ryanair jets instead unless staff agreed to a pay cut and a new labour agreement.
Austria's Vida union had refused to agree to Lauda's contract proposals as it said they would hit some staff hard. 
The union was not immediately available for comment on Friday.
Ryanair bought the Austrian airline from Former Formula One racing champion Niki Lauda in 2018 as part of a 
move to a broader structure with several airline brands.
Lauda's Vienna base hosts 15 of the airline's 30 A320s. O'Leary has said he planned to keep Lauda's other bases 
in Stuttgart, Dusseldorf and Palma open. (Reuters)

Travellers arriving in Britain will face 14 days in quarantine from next month to prevent a second coronavirus 
outbreak, the government announced on Friday, warning that anyone breaking the rules faced a fine or prosecution. 
The new rules will apply to all international arrivals except Ireland from June 8 and come after weeks of calls for 
tougher restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19.  Healthcare professionals travelling to work in the crisis, 
seasonal agricultural workers and those working in freight and road haulage, among others, who will also be 
exempt. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the restrictions were designed to "protect the British public by reducing the 
risk of cases crossing our border". "We are introducing these new measures now to keep the transmission rate 
down and prevent a devastating second wave," she added. 
"I fully expect the majority of people will do the right thing and abide by these measures.  "But we will take 
enforcement action against the minority of people who endanger the safety of others." 'Catch-up' The quarantine 
move is controversial, especially with the aviation sector, where flights have been grounded and passenger 
numbers slumped during lockdown measures. Britain has the second-highest death toll in the world in the global 
pandemic, and the government has been criticised for not imposing border checks and quarantine sooner. Ryanair 
boss Michael O'Leary this week branded a proposed quarantine plan "idiotic" and accused ministers of "making it 
up as they go along". Virgin Atlantic said quarantine would prevent services from resuming and claimed there 
"simply won't be sufficient demand to resume passenger services before August at the earliest". Trade body 
Airlines UK has said it "would effectively kill" international travel to the UK. Others have questioned why Britain did 
not introduce quarantine earlier, like countries such as South Korea, Spain and the United States. "The UK has 
been rather too much on the back foot, increasingly playing catch-up, firefighting," geneticist and Nobel Prize 
winner Paul Nurse told the BBC. "We are desperate for clear leadership at all levels." But Home Office chief 
scientific adviser John Aston defended the quarantine plans, and said border restrictions would have had a 
"negligible" effect if imposed earlier. "As the number of infections within the UK drops, we must now manage the 
risk of transmissions being reintroduced from elsewhere," he added. Contact tracing Britain has recorded the 
highest number of deaths in Europe from coronavirus[1], with more than 36,000 people who have tested positive 
having died so far. Under the new plans, passengers will have to fill in a form providing their contact and travel 
information to enable them to be traced if infections arise. They could also be contacted regularly over the 14-day 
period to ensure they are complying. Rules include not leaving their accommodation or accepting visitors. Where 
accommodation at hotels or with friends and family is deemed unsuitable, travellers will have to self-isolate at 
"facilities arranged by the government", the Home Office said. Breaches carry a 1,000 ($1,220, 1,120 euro) fine in 
UK to introduce 14-day quarantine for international arrivals
England or prosecution with an unlimited fine.  Separate enforcement rules will be set by the devolved governments 
in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Foreign nationals who are not UK residents could be refused entry and 
removed as a last resort, the department added. Britain is currently piloting a contact tracing smartphone app to 
better identify cases and the spread of the virus nationally. New arrivals will be encourage to download the app 
once it is rolled out nationally, the Home Office said. Explore further Follow the latest news on the coronavirus

Contrary to Lex's view (May 18), Ryanair's Michael O'Leary is right to rail against state support for large airline 
employers.
The support given, putting the panic into pandemic as it did, risks distorting the market for decades by propping up 
failing airline business models and not focusing on where it can do the most benefit.
The relief has been ill-thought through and often counter-productive.
Manchester recently supported its airport with an interest free loan of £250m. This is a gift to the Spanish tourism 
industry - worthy recipients no doubt, but perhaps not what was intended.
Airlines that carry citizens out of their country of registration are exporting tourists but, more importantly, importing 
tourism.
Mr O'Leary's suggestion that aid be linked to passengers is worthy of consideration. Aviation's employment 
numbers pale into insignificance against those of tourism. Support needs to be focused and it needs to ensure 
sensible outcomes.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/easyjet-to-resume-flights-next-month-with-strict-face-mask-rule/EasyJet says 
it plans to resume a small number of flights next month with strict safety protocols for passengers and crew 
alike.Top of the measures, the no-frills carrier said, would be the wearing of face masks for all those aboard its 
aircraft. 
The company said it would likely operate domestic flights within the UK and France from 15 June with the only 
international service being Gatwick to Nice initially. The UK airports to see the limited domestic services return will 
be Bristol, Birmingham, Gatwick, Liverpool, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Belfast, easyJet added. 
Shares were more than 2.5% up in early trading after a plunge of 60% in the year to date. The airline made its 
announcement as it faces a series of headaches away from flight operations - largely grounded by COVID-19 since 
March. It revealed on Tuesday a hacking of its digital systems that exposed personal details of nine million 
customers. Easyjet has furloughed thousands of staff and borrowed 600m under a government-backed financing 
scheme as it seeks to shield itself from the effects of the coronavirus crisis that has hit the industry hard, with BA[1], 
Ryanair[2] and Virgin Atlantic collectively planning 18,000 job losses[3]. It said that the cautious commencement of 
flights would only go ahead with a series of measures agreed with regulators and in-line with the advice of national 
governments. The Luton-based airline looks set to be the second operator to resume flights after Wizz Air restarted 
services from the town's airport earlier this month. BA and Ryanair are targeting July. Johan Lundgren, the easyJet 
chief executive, said of its plans: 'These are small and carefully planned steps that we are taking to gradually 
resume operations. 'We will continue to closely monitor the situation across Europe so that when more restrictions 
are lifted the schedule will continue to build over time to match demand, while also ensuring we are operating 
efficiently and on routes that our customers want.' Read more: EasyJet to resume flights next month with strict face

May 21, 2020( Deutsche Welle Germany: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/germany/s-1432 Delivered by Newstex)  
The German flag carrier says it's close to sealing a €9 billion state rescue deal to help it survive the pandemic. 
Europe's second-biggest airline grounded 95% of its fleet due to global border and travel curbs.Lufthansa is closing 
in on a state bailout worth €9 billion ($9.9 billion) that would see the German government take a 20% state in the 
airline group. 
In a filing with the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on Wednesday evening, the national flag carrier said talks are at an 
"advanced stage."The airline added that if the deal proceeds, the government would receive two seats on the 
supervisory board, but it would only exercise its full voting rights in exceptional circumstances, such as to protect 
the firm against a takeover.The statement noted that some €3billion of the cash injection would come from the KfW 
state bank, with the remainder from the government's economic stabilization fund, which was set up to deliver aid to 
businesses affected by the pandemic.A so-called convertible bond from the fund is to be added to this share, which 
can be exchanged for another 5% plus one share.Reuters cited sources involved in the negotiations said the 
stabilization fund had not yet put forward a final offer but was expected to do so on Thursday.Limits on 
management pay, dividendsLufthansa's statement said the firm expected conditions of the deal to include the 
waiver of future dividend payments and limits on management pay, adding the package would have to be approved 
by the European Commission.Read more: Ryanair struggles on without state aid, but still well-placed to fly high 
againIt added that the firm hoped the negotiations would be concluded "promptly."Europe's second-largest airline 
faces severe financial difficulties after travel bans forced the grounding of 95% of its fleet — some 700 planes. The 
company is estimated to be losing in the region of a million euros an hour at present.Last week, the carrier 
confirmed plans to restart hundreds of flights from mid-June.Protracted talks over controlLufthansa's management 
has been in talks with the German government for weeks over a rescue deal to help it cope with what is expected to 
be a protracted travel slump. But the two sides have struggled to agree on how much control the government 
should get in return for support.Rivals such as Franco-Dutch group Air France-KLM and US carriers American 
Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines have also sought state aid.Besides its own services, Lufthansa owns 
several other European carriers, including Austrian Airlines, Swiss International, Brussels Airlines and 
Eurowings.The Cologne-headquartered firm, which has its main operating base in Frankfurt, generated revenues of 
€36.4 billion in the 2019 financial year.DW editors send out a selection of news and features eahc day at 1830UTC.

May 21, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We recently issued an 
updated report on Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1].The company, like other carriers, is bearing the brunt of 
plummeting air-travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's fiscal 2020 profits were hurt by more 
than €40 million. The airline's traffic fell more than 5 million in the period due to travel restrictions and aircraft 
groundings. With apprehensions about fleet grounding in April, May and June, the carrier expects to operate less 
than 1% of its total scheduled flights in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.Consequently, Ryanair expects to incur a loss 
of more than €200 million in the fiscal first quarter. 
During fiscal 2021, the carrier expects to transport less than 80 million passengers that indicates an approximate 
50% drop from its original target of 154 million passengers.Additionally, the company is taking a hit from the Boeing 
737 MAX groundings. Due to delivery delays of the aircraft, the company does not expect to receive its first MAX 
aircraft before October 2020. High fuel costs are also hurting Ryanair's bottom line. Notably, fuel bill increased 14% 
year over year in fiscal 2020.However, Ryanair's strong liquidity position looks impressive. Ryanair's cash and cash 
equivalents at the end of fiscal 2020 stood at €2.57 million, higher than short-term debt of €382.3 million. This 
indicates that the company has enough cash to meet its short-term debt burden.Ryanair Holdings PLC Price

 Ryanair (RYAAY) trade unions are said to be planning to resist attempts to cut pay and conditions for five years by 
the company due to the coronavirus pandemic.
In a letter sent by the airline to several unions, seen by Reuters, Ryanair was cited saying it was in a "battle for 
long-term survival." However, unions in markets such as Ireland, UK, Spain, Italy, and Belgium, told members the 
measures announced the airline this month contradicted guidance to investors.
Ryanair will "likely be one of the big winners of the after-crisis," a memo to trade union members was cited as 
saying in the news report.
On May 1, Ryanair said  recovery in demand and pricing to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels wasn't expected before 
the summer of 2022 "at the earliest," setting the stage for potential job and pay cuts for up to 3,000 employees.
The union also noted the company's CEO has committed to a pay cut for just one year compared with the five the 
company is asking employees to take.

Norwegian Air Shares Plunge Following Approval of Smallest State Aid in Europe to Mitigate Impact of 
Coronavirus Crisis
Norwegian Air Shares Plunge Following Approval of Smallest State Aid in 
Europe to Mitigate Impact of Coronavirus Crisis

 Shares of Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS.OL) were cut in almost half after the carrier disclosed that a state loan 
guarantee totaling three billion Norwegian kroner ($300.4 million) -- the smallest in Europe so far -- has been 
approved and also confirmed the conversion of a portion of its debt to equity.  
The airline, which launched the UK's first low-cost, long haul flights to the US, said it converted 12.7 billion 
Norwegian kroner of debt into equity, according to a statement.
Norwegian, which carries almost six million UK passengers a year, joins other European flag carriers in receiving 
state aid as lockdown measures and social distancing, which are now gradually being eased, have hit the demand 
for domestic and international travel.
Data compiled by Ryanair, the biggest European budget airline, show Germany's Lufthansa has received 12.4 
billion euros ($13.56 billion) in aid, while Air France-KLM has received 10.1 billion euros and Italy's Alitalia was 
handed out 3.5 billion euros to help mitigate the impact on the aviation industry. The data show Norwegian's state-
aid is the smallest so far in Europe.
Shares of Norwegian plunged by as much as 47% early on Wednesday before trading 26% lower at the time of 
writing in London.
"The months ahead will remain challenging and with a high degree of uncertainty for the industry," Chief Executive 
Officer Jacob Schram said. "Norwegian will still need to collaborate closely with a number of creditors as the 
company currently has limited revenue."
Norwegian said it has taken "significant actions" to restructure its operations and return to profitability since the end 
of 2018. An internal cost-reduction program, dubbed Focus2019, delivered "on target" savings of 2.3 billion 
Norwegian kroner. In 2020, it introduced further measures to "improve its results by an additional 1.5 billion 
Norwegian kroner," it said in a separate statement earlier this month.
Norwegian Air Shares Plunge Following Approval of Smallest State Aid in Europe to Mitigate Impact of 
Coronavirus Crisis
The carrier said the COVID-19 pandemic "created an extraordinary situation for us" in that the turmoil in capital 
markets meant it was "not possible to finance businesses in a normal fashion." It had earlier told the Norwegian 
government that the removal of aviation taxes in the country was "not enough" for the company as "we're in a very 
demanding situation at the moment."

Several Ryanair trade unions say they will resist an attempt to cut pay and conditions for a five-year period, citing 
management promises of a swift recovery from the coronavirus crisis and the fact its CEO has committed to a pay 
cut for just one year.
Europe's largest low-cost airline plans to cut 3,000 pilots and cabin crew and reduce pay by up to 20% to deal with 
the crisis which has grounded almost all of its flights until July.
In a letter sent by the airline to several unions, seen by Reuters, Ryanair said it was in a "battle for long-term 
survival."
But unions in key markets, including Ireland, Britain, Spain, Italy and Belgium, told members the measures 
contradicted guidance to investors.
Ryanair said on Monday it saw "significant opportunities" from the crisis and forecast it would "emerge stronger." 
CEO Michael O'Leary said he hoped 2019 passenger levels would return in 2021, with ticket prices recovering in 
2022.
"These statements do not come from an airline that is fighting for its survival," the Belgian Cockpit Association said. 
Ryanair will "likely be one of the big winners of the after-crisis," a memo to members said.
British union BALPA accused Ryanair in a memo of taking advantage of the crisis "to lower long-term costs 
irrespective of when the pandemic is over."
Unions accuse Ryanair of exaggerating COVID threat to undermine conditions
Several unions said they wanted guarantees that if they accept pay cuts, redundancies would be avoided. The 
Belgian union called for Ryanair to cut hours for all pilots to avoid the job losses.
Eddie Wilson, chief executive of Ryanair DAC, Ryanair's main airline unit, said there were signs of "blind optimism" 
from unions, which he said did not understand Ryanair had to be prudent as it had no one to bail it out if the 
situation deteriorated.
He said unions had yet to make a counter offer to the five-year pay proposal. He said the negotiation process was 
not over, but would have to be completed in the coming weeks. (Reuters)

Berlin to close Tegel Airport on June 15, perhaps for good
Berlin to close Tegel Airport on June 15, perhaps for good
dpa international (Englischer Dienst)
May 20, 2020 Wednesday 2:49 PM GMT

Berlin's Tegel Airport is unlikely to survive the coronavirus pandemic, after the operator decided at a meeting on 
Wednesday to close the ageing facility provisionally from June 15, a city finance ministry spokeswoman said.
It is unclear whether the airport will ever reopen. It had already been set for closure towards the end of the year, as 
the German capital prepares for the long-delayed launch of its new BER Airport.
Following Paris' example - Orly Airport was closed on April 1 and flights moved to Charles de Gaulles - Berlin's 
most centrally located and until now busiest airport will be taken offline for two months if passenger numbers don't 
drastically improve in the coming weeks.
Berlin's meagre air traffic will then be consolidated to Schoenefeld Airport, on the capital's south-eastern outskirts.
Last year, over 24 million people flew via Tegel in the city's north-west, making it Germany's fourth-busiest aviation 
hub after Frankfurt, Munich and Dusseldorf before the crisis. Schoenefeld served over 11 million people last year.
But the novel coronavirus outbreak and resulting global travel restrictions caused a steep fall in demand. Recently, 
Berlin's two functioning airports have been flying around 2,000 passengers per day - a tiny fraction of the usual 
capacity.
The coronavirus-induced closure from June is likely to be the end for Tegel Airport, given that reopening for a mere 
matter of months before BER comes online is considered unlikely.
"If I had 50,000 guests, Tegel would go back online immediately," said Engelbert Luetke Daldrup, chief executive of 
the Berlin Brandenburg Airport operator.
"But to be honest, I am not very optimistic that we will be back up to 50,000 guests in a few months."
Berlin to close Tegel Airport on June 15, perhaps for good
Nine years late and beset by a string of scandals, the new BER airport is set to open on a plot adjacent to 
Schoenefeld on October 31. Under the current plans, Tegel is to close for good a week later.
The move to close Tegel prematurely next month was met with criticism from Germany's flagship airline.
"Such a last-minute change of location is complex and costly," a spokeswoman for the Lufthansa Group said.
"In the current crisis, which already poses an enormous challenge to us, this is a further strain."
Lufthansa operates flights from Tegel to its hubs in Munich and Frankfurt.
Subsidiary Eurowings maintains a base at Tegel and is one of the Berlin airport operator's biggest clients, alongside 
Easyjet and Ryanair.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) confirmed its plans to make up to 336 UK pilots redundant and cut salaries by 20% 
despite taking a 600 million pound sterling ($735.6 million) funding from the Bank of England, according to a pilot 
union.
Brian Strutton, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association, said Tuesday the "hypocrisy" of the Irish 
airline receiving state support it previously said it did not want is "hardly surprising."
Strutton also asked what assurances the UK government got from Ryanair, which wants to make redundancies and 
impose pay cuts despite claiming that its balance sheet is "one of the strongest in the industry."
The latest BOE funding takes Ryanair's cash to 4.1 billion euros ($4.49 billion), according to Strutton.

Berlin's busiest airport will close on June 15 for at least two months, though authorities say the closure may be 
permanent. The measure aims to save money amid ongoing travel bans owing to the coronavirus pandemic.Berlin's 
Tegel Airport will temporarily close from June 15 to save costs amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, officials 
announced on Wednesday.The federal government and the states of Berlin and Brandenburg announced the 
decision during a video conference with shareholders. 
Airport operator FBB will close Tegel for around two months, aiming to save around €200,000 ($220,000) a day."In 
the next few months we will see if the capital region needs one or two airports," FBB chief Lütke Dalrup told the 
Deutsche Presse-Agentur."Now it is about taking the next steps responsibly," Daldrup added. "Our next job is to 
ensure the recovery of the air industry and not hinder it."Read more: Berlin's new airport: 'This time it will 
happen'Could the closure be permanent?Berlin Tegel is normally the city's busiest airport. All flight traffic will be 
handled by Berlin Schönefeld airport which operates mainly budget airlines like easyJet and Ryanair. At least 24 
million people flew via Tegel in 2019, making it Germany's fourth-busiest airport.A new airport for the German 
capital, Berlin Brandenburg, was scheduled to open to replace Tegel on October 31 this year, but this plan has had 
doubt cast upon it owing to coronavirus restrictions.However, FBB has remained optimistic that Berlin Brandenburg 
will open as planned, and have duly not ruled out the possibility that Tegel may never reopen.Tegel and Schönefeld 
have seen only around 2,000 passengers per day in recent weeks.ed/aw (dpa, Reuters)Every evening at 1830

Ryanair warned it would make a (EURO)200m loss in its first quarter as the low-cost carrier expected the number of 
passengers flying this year would be about half of its original target due to coronavirus.
The Dublin-based airline said yesterday that it expected to carry 80m passengers during its current fiscal year, 
which started in April, down from its original goal of 154m passengers.
But its shares jumped by almost 10 per cent in a rising market as the airline set out plans to resume flights in July 
and said it was well-positioned to cut ticket prices over the next two years in an attempt to boost demand during the 
recovery it anticipates after the pandemic. The shares, which have fallen by 36 per cent in the year to date, were 
trading around (EURO)9.28 shortly after midday in Dublin.
Ryanair predicted a "smaller loss" in the second quarter than in the first - or possibly to break even - but still 
expected to contend with coronavirus restrictions that have grounded most of its fleet. The airline said it would carry 
"no more than 50 per cent of its original" quarterly traffic target of 44.6m in the July-September period.
"While we're looking at a reasonable return to traffic volumes, we think it will be on the back of much lower air fares 
and yield. We're really flying blind at the moment," Michael O'Leary, the longtime chief executive, told analysts in a 
conference call.
Ryanair warns of (EURO)200m loss in first quarter Airlines
Mr O'Leary said the company did not have "a bull's notion" what 2021's profit or loss would look like. While he 
expected a return to traffic volume "normality" in summer next year, he said it could be summer 2022 before fares 
returned to typical levels.
Ryanair reported (EURO)1bn post-tax profit for the year to March 2020. The start of groundings that month reduced 
profit by (EURO)40m and full-year traffic by more than 5m passengers, Ryanair said, but the annual profit was still 
13 per cent higher than in the previous year.
Flight cancellations led Ryanair to take a (EURO)353m hit on fuel it contracted to buy in advance to counter 
possible price increases but now does not need due to Covid-19 groundings. "We have too much fuel hedged 
compared to what we're going to fly now," said Neil Sorahan, chief financial officer.

Eurozone Bid hopes helped lift ISS after the Danish facility services group named Danske Bank director Jacob 
Aarup-Andersen as its new chief executive.
He will succeed Jeff Gravenhorst, who retires in September after 10 years in the role. "ISS's performance and share 
price have consistently disappointed over the past three years, leading to debate as to whether the company may 
be retaken private," said Jefferies analysts. "In our view, hiring a banker as CEO will likely reignite that debate."
Ryanair led airlines and travel stocks higher after full-year results helped ease liquidity worries.Net profit was 
towards the top end of the target range given in an April trading update and cash balances improved from 
(EURO)3.8bn at the March year-end to (EURO)4.1bn, with weekly cash burn reduced from (EURO)200m in March 
to (EURO)60m in May.
Aéroports de Paris rose even after posting April traffic figures showing its total passenger count down 98.6 per cent.
Thyssenkrupp was up on a report that it was talking to international rivals about possible steel market consolidation.
Radiation therapy equipment maker Elekta surged to its best level since March.

Have face mask, can fly, says Michael O'Leary. The boss of low-cost carrier Ryanair believes masks can eliminate 
the risk of spreading coronavirus and wants passengers to wear them while his airline ramps up business to 40 per 
cent of a normal schedule from almost nil today. It will take more than masks to convince people to fly given the 
current two-week quarantine rule.
Mr O'Leary has plenty of choice words for this policy. Some make more sense than the rules do - such as 
exceptions for travel from France. His case for protesting against state support for large employers such as 
Lufthansa has less force.
Given Ryanair's cash resources, his complaints are understandable. In its full-year results, Mr O'Leary could point 
to more than (EURO)4.1bn of funds. Having slashed costs by 70 per cent to about (EURO)240m monthly, Ryanair 
should last more than a year even if business does not pick up. Mr O'Leary expects a loss in the first quarter to the 
end of June, after which these should subside.
He is in his element. Both workers and airports will be at his mercy. Staff cuts of up to a fifth will not endear him to 
crews, but shareholders will not mind. The depressed share price rose by more than a tenth yesterday. Eventually, 
Ryanair's capacity cuts will provide leverage over airport landing fees. Bernstein expects a capacity crunch of 15-20 
per cent fewer flights to offset lower demand. Mr O'Leary's twin bets are that the quarantine goes away and 
Ryanair's balance sheet strength wins out over rivals.
Ryanair : fight plan Twitter : @FTLex
His claim that other European flag carriers will get a leg-up from state help, causing a fare war, looks moot. Cash 
flow deficits throughout the industry, including at Ryanair, will mean net debt climbs quickly. Heavy discounting, 
which depresses revenues, is not the answer to that build-up.
More than one government minister might welcome putting a mask on Mr O'Leary. It is unlikely to keep him quiet 
when Ryanair shares outperform the European airline sector this year.

https://www.fft.ie/ryanair-2020-financial-results-traffic-increase/31876#respond Ryanair has cut its annual traffic 
target by a further 20%, as the company reports profits after tax of €1bn for the year ending 31st March. 
For the reported financial year, the airline grew traffic by 4% up to 149m passengers, with revenue per guest up by 
6%. Most of Ryanair's fleet was grounded from mid-March by EU Government flight bans and restrictions. These 
groundings reduced March and full year traffic by over 5m guests and cut FY20 profits by over €40m. The company 
said it was unable to provide a forecast for the coming year due to COVID 19, with chief executive Michael O'Leary 
saying it was essentially guesswork. 'For the next 12 months it's obviously impossible for us to today to give you 
any guidance on either traffic numbers or on profits,' said O'Leary in a video presentation. 'We have no idea 
because it is entirely subject to passenger numbers, yields and the lifting of government restrictions.' The airline 
said it expects to carry 'somewhere under' 80m passengers in the coming year. This estimation is down from an 
original target of 154m, which was later revised downwards to 100m. Ryanair has also warned it will look at pulling 
out of some airports in Europe as part of a cost cutting exercise. Michael O'Leary said the airline would look at loss-
making bases in Spain, Germany and the UK initially. The company has gone on a cost cutting drive in recent 
weeks, with 3,000 pilots and cabin crew as well as 250 HQ staff likely to lose their jobs. The company has again 
expressed its support for Boeing's grounded 737-MAX-200 aircraft: 'We remain fans of, and committed to, these 
'gamechanger' aircraft with 4% more seats &#38; 16% lower fuel burn, which will transform Ryanair's cost base for 
the next decade'.

May 19, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] and Latin American carrier Azul AZUL[2] reported losses in 
first-quarter 2020 results. With coronavirus continuing to wreak havoc, the carriers have been persistently incurring 
losses for this earnings season. Notably, the likes of Spirit Airlines SAVE[3] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[4] too 
suffered losses for the March quarter, which they confirmed while announcing respective first-quarter financial 
numbers in the previous week[5].Delta Air Lines DAL[6] also grabbed headlines in the past week by virtue of its 
decision to retire its Boeing 777 fleet by the end of this year as it aims to control costs in response to the 
coronavirus-inflicted extremely bleak demand scenario.Wrap-Up on the Past Week's Key Headlines1. Azul incurred 
a loss of $1.63 per share on an adjusted basis in the first quarter of 2020, wider than the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of a loss of 50 cents. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 49 cents per 
share. 
The first-quarter results were affected by the coronavirus-induced drop in demand and depreciation of the Brazilian 
Real. Fuel cost hedging losses also weighed on the company's performance. Moreover, with capacity expansion 
outpacing traffic growth, consolidated load factor deteriorated 90 basis points to 81%[7].2. Delta, which is currently 
burning $50 million cash per day, aims to reduce its cash burn rate to zero by 2020-end. The decision to retire its 
Boeing 777 fleet is a step toward achieving this financial goal.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier aims to maintain a 
trimmed fleet size and network as well as curb itsoverall operations over the next two to three years. In line with this 
objective, the carrier already accelerated the retirement of its MD-90 aircraft, which is set to be removed in June 
2020[8]. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[9].3. Ryanair incurred a 
loss of $1.16 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 (ended Mar 31, 2020), narrower than the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.29. However, the amount of loss widened year over year. Quarterly revenues of 
$1,323 million, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,189 million. The top line also declined 
year over year due to the coronavirus-led drop in air travel demand. Moreover, Ryanair's profit after tax declined 
26.7% year over year in fiscal 2020. The impact of the coronavirus-triggered low demand for air travel was more 
than €40 million on profits. Fiscal 2020 earnings came in at €0.58 per share, down 24.4% year over year. Ryanair 
expects to operate less than 1% of its total scheduled flights in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. From July onward, 
some of the flight services are expected to be resumed.The carrier expects to incur a loss of more than €200m in 
the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of the coronavirus-induced decline in traffic and weak pricing. With the 
Airline Stock Roundup: RYAAY, AZUL Post Q1 Loss, DAL, ALGT in Focus
company anticipating a rise in demand during the peak summer season, losses are expected to decrease 
sequentially in the fiscal second quarter. The carrier expects to transport less than 80 million passengers during 
fiscal 2021. This indicates an approximate 50% slump from its original target of 154 million passengers.4. At 
Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[10], the April traffic for scheduled service, measured in revenue passenger miles 
(RPMs), plunged 97% on a year-over-year basis. Scheduled capacity, calculated in available seat miles (ASMs), 
also tumbled 87.2% in the month. With traffic declining more than the contraction in capacity, load factor (or 
percentage of seats filled by passengers) deteriorated 61.7 percentage points year over year to 19.3%.5. Per a 
Reuters report[11], South-American carrier, LATAM Airlines Group LTM[12] will lay off 1400 employees (3% of its 
workforce) as it tries to combat the current low-demand scenario due to the pandemic. Notably, LATAM's Latin 
American counterparts, namely Gol Linhas GOL[13] and Azul have a sizeable proportion of their employees on 
unpaid leave.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of major airline players over the past week 
and during the past six months. The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green over the past 
week, resulting in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining 2.4% to $44.11. Over the course of six months, the index 
has depreciated 59.6%.What's Next in the Airline Space?With the first-quarter earnings season almost over, 
investors will look forward to updates from carriers to combat the coronavirus crisis.5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach

May 19, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] incurred a loss of $1.16 per share in fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 (ended Mar 31, 2020), narrower than the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.29. The loss deteriorated year over year.Quarterly revenues of $1,323 
million also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,189 million. However, the top line suffered year over 
year due to the coronavirus-led drop in air travel demand.Fiscal 2020 ResultsRyanair's profit after tax plunged 
26.7% year over year in fiscal 2020. The impact of coronavirus-led low demand for air travel was more than €40 
million on profits. Fiscal 2020 earnings per share came in at €0.58 per share, down 24.4% year over year. Total 
revenues ascended 10% to €8.5 billion owing to a 4% rise in traffic (149 million guests). Traffic decreased by more 
than 5 million due to travel restrictions and aircraft groundings, thanks to coronavirus. 
Load factor deteriorated to 95% from 96% in the year-ago period. Ancillary revenues rose 20% year over year for 
full fiscal 2020.The airlines' fuel costs increased 14% year over year. Additionally, non-fuel unit costs rose 4%, 
affected by a 48% slump in March traffic due to coronavirus-related woes.Ryanair Holdings PLC Price, Consensus

Holdings PLC Quote[3] Balance Sheet HighlightsRyanair, carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), currently has a 
cash balance of €4.1 billion. Through stringent cost-cutting measures, the company has been able to reduce its 
average weekly cash burn rate to around €60 million in May, from approximately €200 million in 
March.OutlookRyanair expects to operate less than 1% of its total scheduled flights in the first quarter of fiscal 
2021. From July onward some of the flight services are expected to resume. However, with bookings anticipated to 
be affected by public health restrictions and mandatory quarantines, the carrier expects to carry only 50% of its 
second-quarter traffic guidance of 44.6 million guests.The carrier expects to incur a loss of more than €200 million 
in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of the coronavirus-induced decline in traffic and low pricing. With the 
company anticipating a rise in demand during the peak summer season, losses are expected to decrease 
sequentially in second-quarter fiscal 2021. The carrier expects to transport less than 80 million passengers during 
fiscal 2021. This indicates an approximate 50% drop from its original target of 154 million passengers. Performance 
of Other Airline StocksGol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL[4], carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reported earnings 
of 20 cents per share (excluding $3.08 from non-recurring items) in first-quarter 2020. The bottom line increased

share (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring items) in the first quarter of 2020, narrower than the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of 48 cents. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported earnings of 70 cents per share. The results 
reflect the coronavirus-induced drop in passenger demand. Meanwhile, operating revenues of $4,234 million lagged 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,397 million and declined 17.8% year over year.American Airlines AAL[7], 
carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), incurred a loss (excluding $2.61 from non-recurring items) of $2.65 per share in 
first-quarter 2020, comparing unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $2.16. The company 
reported earnings per share of 52 cents in the year-ago quarter. Results in first-quarter 2020 were hurt by the 
coronavirus-led drop in air-travel demand. Operating revenues of $8,515 million declined 19.6% year over year and

May 19, 2020( Phil's Stock World: http://www.philstockworld.com Delivered by Newstex)  Courtesy of ZeroHedge[1] 
View original post here[2]. After several weeks of economic, political and corporate earnings, things finally quiet 
down this week as Q1 earnings season comes to an end with a handful of retailers (at least the ones that aren't 
bankrupt yet) set to report. The main data release this week will be the flash PMIs for May from around the world on 
Thursday and Friday, according to DB's Jim Reid. The consensus is expecting services in Europe to bounce from 
low teens to the mid-twenties area and manufacturing to go up a few points in the thirties. The PMIs are diffusion 
indices, with respondents simply saying whether things are better or worse than the previous month so they are a 
little difficult to calibrate to growth at such extreme levels of activity but they will be a big curiosity nonetheless. 
 There's a raft of central bank events this week, including a number from the Fed. The highlights are likely to be the 
two sets of remarks from Fed Chair Powell that we mentioned above. Aside from that, there'll also be remarks to 
digest from Vice Chair Clarida and New York Fed President Williams on Thursday, as well as other regional Fed 
Presidents throughout the week. Finally on the Fed, it'll be worth keeping an eye out for the release of the minutes 
from April's meeting on Wednesday. On Friday, the ECB will also be publishing their account of the most recent 
monetary policy meeting.  Earnings season continues to wind down over the week ahead, with over 90% of the 
S&#38;P 500 companies having now reported. This week will only see a further 22 companies from the S&#38;P 
500 and 30 from the STOXX 600 announce earnings. In terms of the highlights, today we'll hear from Ryanair, 
Lufthansa and Panasonic. Then tomorrow we have Walmart and Home Depot, before Wednesday sees Lowe's, 
Target and Experian report. On Thursday, there's Nvidia, Medtronic, Intuit, TJX and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, 
and finally on Friday there's Deere &#38; Company and Alibaba.  Finally on Friday, the National People's Congress 
will open in China. The central government is expected to unveil more fiscal measures, aimed at supporting 
households and encouraging consumption. Another thing that will be interesting to see is whether a numerical GDP 
target for this year is made, since Bloomberg reported previously that one option that could be done instead is to 
have a description of the GDP goal.  Below, courtesy of Deutsche Bank, is a day-by-day calendar of events:

May 19, 2020( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Millions 
of easyJet passengers had their names, email addresses and travel details breached in a "highly sophisticated" 
cyber attack, the airline has said. The hackers obtained credit card details of over 2,200 flyers.Unknown attackers 
accessed data of roughly 9 million easyJet passengers, the budget airline said on Tuesday. 
The company "engaged leading forensic experts to investigate the issue" after detecting the "highly sophisticated" 
attack in January, easyJet chief Johan Lungren said in a statement.The hackers mostly uncovered names, emails, 
and travel details of the affected passengers. However, they also stole credit card information of 2,208 customers. 
EasyJet said that people affected in the credit card breach have already been contacted and the rest of targeted 
passengers will be contacted in the coming days.At the same time, they said there was "no evidence" that any of 
the stolen information had been misused.Read more: Social-distance flying the new normal?Fears of a fineLungren 
apologized to customers and said that companies needed to "stay agile to stay ahead of the threat."He also noted 
that "owning to COVID-19 there is heightened concern about personal data being used for online scams."The UK 
company, like most airlines around the world, was forced to ground most of its fleet due to travel restrictions 
prompted by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The carrier could now face a hefty fine from the British authorities 
over the hacking, similar to a $230 million (€210 million) penalty imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office 
(ICO) on British Airways last year. After the flagship carrier was targeted in cyber attack, the ICO said British 
Airways was responsible for failing to protect the data. The airline is still appealing the decision.On Tuesday, 
easyJet said they had been working with the ICO since learning of the attack."As a result, and on the 
recommendation of the ICO, we are contacting those customers whose travel information was accessed and we are 
advising them to be extra vigilant, particularly if they receive unsolicited communications," Lungren said.Read more:

European airlines hope to resume flights but outlook is dim

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) - European airlines are planning for a return to the skies this summer after being 
grounded almost completely for weeks over the coronavirus pandemic.
The outlook, however, remains uncertain, with companies forecasting a slow recovery even next year due to public 
health restrictions and concerns.
Finland's national airline, a major carrier between Europe and China, said Monday it will add more flights and routes 
beginning in July if governments ease their lockdowns enough for travel to resume.
It will restart in phases, with a strong focus on Asia, which is strategically important for the state-controlled airline. 
The Helsinki-based company said it will fly to Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, adding it was pending government 
approval, but also to Nagoya, Osaka and Tokyo Narita in Japan; and to Singapore, Seoul and Bangkok.
"We expect aviation to recover gradually, starting in July", Finnair Chief Commercial Officer Ole Orver said in a 
statement. "Our intention is to operate approximately 30% of our normal amount of flights in July, and we will also 
start long-haul flights to our key Asian destinations. We will then add routes and frequencies month by month as 
demand recovers."
In July, Finnair also aims to resume flying to several cities in Europe as well as six domestic routes. Destinations in 
Spain, Italy and Poland would be added in August.
The airline does not expect passengers to have to sit next to each other as the numbers are forecast to be small.
Spokesperson Paivyt Tallqvist told the AP that customers "are seated as far away from each other as possible" with 
the exception of families, which can sit together. Seating is reviewed at the gate.
She added that as of Monday, "we require everyone to wear a mask onboard, as masks are considered to be a 
good solution for those situations where maintaining distance is not possible." The masks are to be worn during the 
entire flight but doesn't apply to children under 7.
European airlines hope to resume flights but outlook is dim
Passengers will be asked to stand at least 1 meter (3.3 feet) from each other at the airport, buses will be kept half 
empty, and customers will be are asked to avoid unnecessary movement in the cabin.
Other airlines are likewise preparing to fly more soon, though the prospects remain uncertain.
The Lufthansa Group's low-cost carrier Eurowings said Monday it was expanding its summer vacation flights 
starting from June by adding 40 destinations including Spain's Mallorca, Split in Croatia and the Greek island of 
Santorini. The airline warned that customers should check the status of local restrictions. It offered free rebooking 
up until 14 days before departure, including changing destination on flights within Europe.
Budget airline Ryanair, which had been the busiest carrier in Europe before the pandemic hit, has also said it is 
preparing to restart flights in July, pending an easing in lockdowns. On Monday, it said it expects a record loss of 
200 billion euros ($220 billion) for the April-June quarter, when the heaviest restrictions on public life were 
implemented across Europe.
It also expects a slow recovery, estimating it will carry only 50% of its previously forecast number of passengers in 
the fully year 2021.

The outbreak of the coronavirus has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed. Following are 
developments Monday related to national and global response, the work place and the spread of the virus.
________________________
DAY AFTER: States are trying to figure out the safest way to restart their economies despite conflicting guidance 
out from Washington. The same goes for companies.
- As Apple begins opening stores in the U.S., it will be checking the temperatures of everyone before they can enter 
and handing out masks to any customer who isn't wearing one. Like other retailers, Apple will be limiting the 
number of people inside and doing deep cleanings throughout the day.
The iPhone maker reopened five U.S. stores last week in Idaho, Alabama, South Carolina and Alaska. Another 27 
stores will be reopening in California, Washington state, Florida, Colorado, Hawaii, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The 
stores in California and Washington initially will only offer curbside and storefront service.
Apple so far has reopened about 100 stores worldwide, roughly one-fifth of its brick-and-mortar outlets.
- The Children's Place plans to reopen stores in 10 states: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, 
Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Utah. More than 40% of U.S. stores are in areas where 
they are unauthorized to open again.
TRAVEL & LEISURE: Tourist destinations are beginning to release reopening dates, but there will be new rules in 
place governing activities and the number of people allowed.
- The Florida Keys will reopen to tourists on June 1, more than two months after the island chain put up check 
points to limit outsiders. Those will be removed next month, according to Monroe County Emergency Management. 
Hotels and other lodging establishments will be allowed to reopen at 50% occupancy.
- New Hampshire restaurants were allowed to begin serving customers for outdoor dining on Monday.
Business, government operate under new rules, market rallies
- Delta Air Lines plans to restart several domestic and international routes in June, including service to China if 
Beijing approves. The airline plans to add some flights next month in Atlanta and New York and resume some 
international routes.
- Allegiant Air said April traffic tumbled 97% and empty seats quadrupled compared with a year earlier. Allegiant is a 
budget airline that flies people from smaller cities to vacation destinations like Las Vegas, where many of the major 
attractions were closed to limit spread of the coronavirus.
- Ryanair is cutting around 3,000 jobs and is looking at pulling out of a number of airports in Europe. The budget 
Irish carrier cut the number of passengers it expects to fly this year from 154 million, too 100 million last week. It cut 
that again Monday to about 80 million.
- Finland's national airline, a major carrier between the European Union and China, is adding flights and routes, with 
long-haul routes beginning in July. Finnair will start in phases, with a strong focus on Asia.
GOVERNMENTS & CENTRAL BANKS: Dozens of economies are either heading for a recession, or area already 
there. On Monday, that designation become official in Japan. Countries are trying to general economic activity with 
new parameters.
- Greece reopened the Acropolis in Athens and other ancient sites Monday, along with high schools, shopping 
malls, and leisure travel. There is some urgency. The EU Commission warned that Greece is likely to suffer the 
worst recession in the EU bloc this year.
- Ireland is taking its first steps out of lockdown, with some stores reopening and outdoor work resuming. Garden 
centers, hardware stores and opticians are among the businesses being allowed to open Monday.
- Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan eased lockdown restrictions Monday. In Kazakhstan's capital, some mosques, 
markets cafes and restaurants reopened Monday. In Azerbaijan, cafes and restaurants reopened in the capital, 
Baku, and four others cities.
- Thousands of people in Bosnia who lost their jobs over the past two months have been blocked by cumbersome 
and lengthy application procedures from accessing unemployment benefits they had been promised by the 
government. According to incomplete official statistics, over 30,000 people have lost their jobs in Bosnia since 
March.
MARKETS: After suffering the sharpest sell-off since mid-March, when the virus spread rapidly in the U.S., Wall 
Street and global markets appear to be bouncing back.
- Stocks closed sharply higher on Wall Street Monday, extending a global rally amid optimism about a potential 
vaccine for the coronavirus and hopes for a U.S. economic recovery in the second half of the year.
HOPE RALLY: Shares of the pharmaceutical company Moderna surged 20% after it said that early data from 
testing of its coronavirus vaccine shows that it helped create immune responses that might help prevent against 
infection. The company also deemed the vaccine "generally safe and well tolerated" by the individuals who took it.
IRS HELP: The IRS said Monday that it is adding 3,500 telephone representatives to answer some of taxpayer's 
questions about economic impact payments. The bulk of the estimated 150 million payments have been sent but 
some questions remain.
Separately, the Treasury and IRS began to send nearly 4 million of the relief payments by prepaid debit card, 
instead of paper check. The free, prepaid cards are being distributed to those without bank information on file with 
the IRS.

Ryanair Projects 'Difficult' Fiscal 2021, Expects Loss in First-Quarter as COVID-19 Pandemic Casts Doubt

Ryanair Projects 'Difficult' Fiscal 2021, Expects Loss in First-Quarter as 
COVID-19 Pandemic Casts Doubt Over Short-Term Demand

 Ryanair, the largest European budget carrier, said early on Monday it expects a loss in the first quarter while 
warning that the full-year 2021 would be difficult because of a "substantial decline in traffic and pricing from COVID-
19 grounding". 
The Dublin, Ireland-based company, which reported a higher profit after tax and sales in fiscal 2020 that ended 
March 31, said in its earnings statement that consultations were underway for base closures, pay cuts of up to 20%, 
and as many as 3,000 job losses.
The firm said that it expects to record a loss of more than 200 million euros ($216.5 million) in the first quarter as 
well as a further-but-smaller loss in the second quarter. It is forecasting passenger traffic of less than 80 million in 
fiscal 2021, compared with a target of 154 million.
Ryanair's return to scheduled flying will be rendered "significantly more difficult by competing with flag carrier 
airlines who will be financing below-cost selling with the benefit of over 30 billion euros in State Aid," the company 
said. "Unlike many flag carrier competitors, Ryanair will not request or receive state aid," the company added.
The group has decided not to offer fiscal 2021 profit after tax guidance because of the uncertainty over the impact 
and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as "no" visibility on customer behavior and demand following the 
return to service.
In the fiscal year 2020, Ryanair reported sales of 8.49 billion euros compared with 7.69 billion euros a year ago as 
the number of passengers flown climbed by 4%. Its profit after tax for the period jumped to one billion euros.
Since mid-March, the group said that it has taken action to preserve cash, cut costs and cancel share buybacks. 
The firm, which currently has a cash balance of 4.1 billion euros, pointed out that its average weekly cash burn has 
been brought down to just over 60 million euros in May from about 200 million euros in March.

Ryanair said also that it does not expect the first 737 MAX 200 aircraft to arrive before October given that Boeing 
(BA) was guiding for a late-summer return to service in the US for its 737 MAX. The airlines said the 
"gamechanger" aircraft with 4% more seats and 16% lower fuel burn would transform its cost base for the next 
decade.

Ryanair cut its annual passenger traffic target by another 20% and warned it will look at pulling out of some airports 
across Europe as it booked a 13% rise in annual profit after tax on Monday.
The Irish low-cost carrier, Europe's largest, said it expects to fly "somewhere under" 80 million passengers in the 
coming year, down from a target of 100 million given last week and from an original target of 154 million.
CEO Michael O'Leary admitted it was essentially guesswork at this stage.
"For the next 12 months it's obviously impossible for us to today to give you any guidance on either traffic numbers 
or on profits," O'Leary said in a video presentation.
"We have no idea because it is entirely subject to passenger numbers, yields and the lifting of government 
restrictions."
Ryanair reported a profit before tax of 1 billion euros for the year to March 31.
Ryanair shares opened up 4% at 8.82 euros.
O'Leary said the airline would first look at loss-making bases in the UK, Germany and Spain for closure, but may 
then look at Italy, Belgium and central and eastern Europe if necessary.
It is also likely to close the main base of its subsidiary Lauda in Austria, which is undergoing an "existential crisis" 
due to COVID-19, he said.
Ryanair will look at pulling out of some airports across Europe
Ryanair is currently undertaking a major cost cutting drive, with 3,000 pilots and cabin crew likely to lose their jobs 
as well as 250 people at head office.
Ryanair expects to post a loss of "just over" 200 million euros in the three months to the end of June and either 
break even or post a small loss for July-September, O'Leary said.
He admitted to having "no visibility" on customer behaviour but said he expected demand to return pretty quickly on 
deep discounting.
Pre-crisis ticket price levels will not return until 2022 "or later", O'Leary said.
The airline last week has said it expects a surge in bookings in the coming weeks from people who have been 
cooped up at home for months.
While there has been an increase in searches for sun holidays in recent days, it remains "early days" to gauge that 
demand, Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan said in an interview.
 
CASH BURN FALLS
Ryanair reported a current cash balance of 4.1 billion euros and said its weekly cash burn has dropped to just over 
60 million in May from around 200 million euros in March.
The airline booked an exceptional charge of 353 million euros for hedging on fuel and currency hedges it put in 
place last year which it did not need.
That includes foreign exchange hedges worth around 40 million that offset some of the losses caused by hedging at 
high prices.
The airline is "sitting on the sidelines" for now in terms of hedging future fuel bills, Sorahan said. (Reuters)

Ryanair plans to close Lauda's Vienna VIE base
Ryanair plans to close Lauda's Vienna VIE base

Ryanair Group is preparing to close Lauda's Airbus A320 base at Vienna (VIE) on May 30 unless an agreement 
over cost reductions can be reached.
Group CEO Michael O'Leary warned that the airline would only survive the COVID-19 crisis with "deep 
restructuring" of the base.
In a video presentation released alongside its full-year financial results, O'Leary said talks were already underway 
unions in relation to staff savings. However, unless a deal is struck by May 20, the group expects to close Lauda's 
main base with 300 job losses.
"The Vienna base will close at the end of May if the Austrian unions don't agree to a new CLA [collective labor 
agreement] with pay cuts and productivity increases for pilots and cabin crew," O'Leary said.
"Frankly, it would be cheaper to ground the Airbus aircraft in Vienna and not fly them than it would to continue to fly 
them with an ineffective and disastrous CLA."
O'Leary admitted it was unlikely that the unions would agree to the reforms. However, he said that the VIE base, 
which is home to half of Lauda's 30 A320s, could "survive and thrive" if a deal is reached. Other bases in 
Dusseldorf (DUS) and Stuttgart (STR) in Germany as well as Palma de Mallorca (PMI) in Spain will remain open.
Lauda was founded by motorsport legend Niki Lauda as Laudamotion in early 2018 following the demise of former 
Air Berlin subsidiary NIKI. Ryanair initially took a 24.9% stake before assuming full ownership in January 2019.
The Austrian airline's fleet has been grounded since March 17 as a result of the coronavirus crisis and the LCC is 
having to "completely rethink" its strategy and "significantly lower" its growth plans. Lauda has already canceled the 
delivery of eight A320s from lessors this year and abandoned plans to operate a base in Zadar, Croatia.
Although traffic grew to 6.4 million in the 12 months to March 31, Ryanair said the airline "underperformed" during 
the year amid "intense price competition from Lufthansa subsidiaries in its core Austrian and German markets."
Competition in VIE has been fierce since NIKI's failure and the airport has become a battleground for LCCs, 
coupled with the expansion of Eurowings and Austrian Airlines to defend their market share.
Ryanair plans to close Lauda's Vienna VIE base
OAG Schedules Analyser data shows that there were 6.16 million low-cost departure seats on offer from VIE in 
2019, compared with 3.96 million in 2018. Lauda commanded a 7.1% share of all available departure seats, behind 
Austrian on 43.7% and Eurowings on 7.4%.
According to schedules filed before the COVID-19 crisis, Lauda intended to operate flights to 73 destinations from 
VIE during the summer 2020 season and offer 1.7 million departure seats.
As well as the planned restructure of Lauda, Ryanair Group has entered consultations about further base closures 
across Europe, with up to 3,000 jobs set to be affected. The group has not revealed which bases have been 
earmarked for closure, but O'Leary said the focus was on loss-making operations in the UK, Spain and Germany.
He added: "If we don't secure pay cuts across the board in Europe, other bases in Italy, Belgium and Central and 
Eastern Europe will also be up for closure."
Ryanair Group reported revenues of (EURO)8.49 billion ($9.18 billion) in the year ending March 31, a 10% rise on 
the previous 12 months. Profit after tax grew by 13% to (EURO)1 billion and the number of passengers carried 
increased by 4% to 148.6 million.
Most of Ryanair's fleet was grounded from mid-March by coronavirus-related travel restrictions. The group said the 
travel bans reduced traffic by 5 million passengers and profit by more than (EURO)40 million.
The airline hopes to operate a daily schedule of almost 1,000 flights from July 1, with service from "most" of its 80 
bases across Europe. Its planned schedules from July would restore 90% of its pre-COVID-19 route network and 
40% of capacity.

       Low fares airline Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported Monday that its fiscal 2020 profit before tax on 
IFRS basis declined to 670.3 million euros from last year's 948.1 million euros.
 Attributable profit was 648.7 million euros or 0.5793 euro per share, down from 885 million euros or 0.7665 euro 
per share a year ago.
 Adjusted profit before tax was 1.08 billion euros and adjusted attributable profit was 1 billion euros for the latest 
year.
 Total operating revenues increased 10 percent to 8.49 billion euros from 7.69 billion euros a year ago.
 Traffic grew 4 percent to 148.6 million guests. Revenue per guest rose 6 percent to 57 euros with 2 percent higher 
fares. Load Factor, meanwhile, dropped 1 percentage points to 95 percent.
 The company noted that most of its fleet was grounded from mid-March by EU Government flight bans and 
restrictions. These groundings reduced March and full year traffic by over 5 million guests and cut FY20 profits by 
over 40 million euros.
 Looking ahead for the first quarter, the company expects to record a loss of over 200 million euros, with a smaller 
loss expected in Q2 in the peak summer due to a substantial decline in traffic and pricing from Covid-19 
groundings.
 For fiscal 2021, the company currently expects to carry less than 80 million passengers, almost 50 percent below 
its original 154 million target.
 The company noted that fiscal 2021 will be difficult as its airlines work hard to return to scheduled flying following 
the Covid-19 crisis. Unlike many flag carrier competitors, Ryanair will not request or receive State Aid.
Ryanair FY20 Profit Down; Sees Loss In Q1, Q2; Cuts FY21 Traffic View
 Ryanair cannot provide FY21 profit after tax guidance at this time due to the uncertainty over the impact and 
duration of the Covid-19 pandemic, coupled with no visibility on what customer behaviour and demand will be 
following a return to service. 
 Further, Ryanair said its return to scheduled flying will be rendered significantly more difficult by competing with 
flag carrier airlines who will be financing below cost selling with the benefit of over 30 billion euros in unlawful State 
Aid, in breach of both EU State Aid and competition rules.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) on Monday reported a 29% decline in attributable profit for fiscal 2020 following a 407 
million euros ($440.2 million) charge for the ineffectiveness of its fuel hedge.
The Irish budget airline's attributable profit for fiscal 2020 ended March 31 fell to 648.7 million euros, or 0.58 euro 
per share, compared with 885 million euros, or 0.77 euro per share, in fiscal 2019.
Pre-tax profit plunged to 670.3 million euros, compared with 948.1 million euros. Revenue decreased to 8.49 billion 
euros, compared with 7.70 billion euros.
Looking forward, Ryanair expects to record a loss of more than 200 million euros in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company reduced its average weekly cash burn to about 60 million euros in May from 200 million euros in 
March by cutting the pay of its staff, making up to 3,000 job cuts and giving other staff unpaid leave. However, the 
company expects to carry less than 80 million passengers in fiscal 2021.
Ryanair is scheduled to resume flights in July.
The company's shares rose about 4% on Monday morning.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/governments-quarantine-plan-is-idiotic-says-ryanair-boss/The 
government's 
plan to quarantine arrivals in the UK is 'idiotic' and will be ignored by the travelling public, according to the boss of 
Ryanair.Michael O'Leary said that the proposals, due to be implemented by the start of June, were likely to be 
shunned by many people because they were 'hopelessly defective', doing little to control the spread of coronavirus. 
He called instead for the compulsory use of facemasks on all flights, as well as on trains and the London 
Underground, claiming that this would be a more effective measure to manage the infection. 
He spoke out as Ryanair posted its annual results, with the airline warning that it expected overall passenger 
numbers to almost halve in the current financial year. The budget carrier reported a 13 per cent increase in profits 
to €1 billion (890 million) for the year ending in March on revenue up 10 per cent to €8.4 billion (7.6 billion). 
However, it said that it expected to deliver significant losses in the current quarter because of the impact of 
coronavirus. Mr O'Leary warned that the impact could be exacerbated by the government's plan to require all 
arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days[1], regardless of their mode of travel. Ministers are expected to abandon efforts 
today to exempt travellers from France, although hauliers, scientists, medics and border officials will not have to 
comply. The plan has infuriated airlines and tour operators, who warn that it will undermine any attempt to resurrect 
their industries following the lockdown. Tour operators such as Tui and Jet2 have been planning to restart holidays 
as soon as mid-June but if Britons are required to self-isolate on their return this is likely to prevent any large-scale 
bookings. British Airways has already said that it will not resume major flight operations while the quarantine 
remains in place. Mr O'Leary said today that the policy was 'idiotic and it is un-implementable'. Speaking on BBC 
Radio 4's Today programme, he said: 'You don't have enough police in the UK to implement a two-week lockdown. 
And what's really worrying is that a two-week lockdown has no medical or scientific basis to it in any event. If you 
really want to do something that's effective, wear masks.' Ryanair has announced plans to implement 40 per cent of 
flights — 1,000 a day — from the start of July as part of its own recovery. It has said that facemasks will be 
compulsory on flights and at airports. The airline has also told passengers that it may take their temperature before 
they fly and refuse to allow those with a fever on board. Mr O'Leary said that it was likely that the quarantine plan 
would be dropped within weeks because people would refuse to abide by it. 'The 14-day lockdown has no 
credibility[2] and I think will be eliminated by the time we get to the end of June anyway,' he said. 'As the 
government puts more meat on the bones of an un-implementable, unmanageable and un-policeable 14-day 
Government's quarantine plan is idiotic, says Ryanair boss
lockdown, people will simple ignore something that is so hopelessly defective in favour of . . . some effective 
measures like facemasks. Facemasks are effective; 14-day isolations aren't. ' In its results, the airline said that it 
saw an increase in passengers for the full year but that since the start of April it had operated less than 1 per cent of 
its scheduled flights. It told investors that it had sufficient funds to 'weather Covid-19 and emerge stronger when the 
crisis passes'. Ryanair is in the midst of consultations over base closures, job cuts of up to 3,000 mainly affecting 
pilots and cabin crew, and pay cuts as it looks to keep costs low. Nevertheless the Irish carrier expects to post a 
loss of more than €200 million (178 million) for the quarter to the end of June. It expects a smaller loss in the 
second quarter amid a 'substantial decline in traffic and pricing' as a result of the coronavirus groundings. Ryanair 
said that it expected passenger numbers for the current year to be 'less than 80 million', reducing its target of 100 
million given last week. Its original target had been 154 million. In a statement, Ryanair said: 'Full year 2021 will be 
difficult for the Ryanair Group as its airlines work hard to return to scheduled flying following the covid-19 crisis. As 
we look beyond the next year, there will be significant opportunities for Ryanair's low cost, growth model as 
competitors shrink, fail or are acquired by government bailed out carriers.' Read more: Government's quarantine

stores in the U.S., it will be handing out masks that will be mandatory to customers who don't have one, doing

they are unauthorized to open again.  Workers will be wearing masks and customers will be encouraged to do so. 
Fitting rooms, bathrooms and water fountains in stores will remain closed and returned items will not be returned for 
display for 24 hours.  TRAVEL &#38; LEISURE: Tourist destinations are beginning to release reopening dates, but 
there will be new rules in place governing activities and the number of people allowed.  — The Florida Keys will 
reopen to tourists on June 1, more than two months after the island chain put up check points to limit outsiders. 
Those will be removed next month, according to Monroe County Emergency Management. Hotels and other lodging 
establishments will be allowed to reopen at 50% occupancy. The businesses must implement sanitation stations 
and follow the American Hotel and Lodging Association's cleaning guidelines for COVID-19. (Ad) In this shocking

cumbersome and lengthy application procedures from accessing unemployment benefits they had been promised 
by the government. According to incomplete official statistics, over 30,000 people have lost their jobs in Bosnia 
since March.  Experts warn that many of those jobs will be lost for good, dealing a heavy blow to the country of 
some 3.5 million people where nearly 40% of the labor force had been unemployed prior to the pandemic. 
MARKETS: After suffering the sharpest sell-off since mid-March, when the virus spread rapidly in the U.S., Wall 
Street and global markets appear to be bouncing back.  — U.S. markets rebounded Monday from losses last week 
after the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve expressed optimism that the American economy might start to recover 
this year.  HOPE RALLY: — Shares of the pharmaceutical company Moderna surged 25%, and U.S. markets 
surged higher, after it said Monday that early data from testing of its coronavirus vaccine shows that it helped create 
immune responses that might help prevent against infection. The company also deemed the vaccine 'generally safe 
and well tolerated" by the individuals that took it. 5 Travel Company Stocks Likely to Suffer From the 
Coronavirus[1]How important is the global travel and tourism industry? It's a sector that accounts for about 10% of 
the world's adult workforce. That's 350 million people. The industry also accounts for at least 4% of the global gross 
domestic product (GDP). In short, it's an industry that accounts for trillions of dollars for the economy. And it relies 
on the most visible workers like pilots and cruise ship captains to the kitchen and housecleaning staff and servers. 
The travel industry is in many ways a service industry. But when there's nobody to service, these businesses take a 
tumble. And tumble it has. The world is going through a period of enforced social distancing. Many countries are 
taking even more extreme measures to lock down parts, or all, of their countries in an effort to contain the spread of 
the coronavirus and to flatten the curve to prevent healthcare workers and hospitals from being overwhelmed. But 
that means fewer people are flying. Planned vacations are being canceled. And all of this is bad news for a sector 
that relies on the mobility of global travelers. To be fair, the best of these companies should recover just fine. 
However, some of these companies had fundamental concerns that will be magnified by the loss of revenue. View

— Finland's national airline, a major carrier between Europe and China, said Monday it will add more flights and 
routes beginning in July if governments ease their lockdowns enough for travel to resume. 
 The outlook for flying overall, however, remains uncertain, with companies forecasting a slow recovery even next 
year due to public health restrictions and concerns. Finnair, which had been forced to temporarily cancel flights to 
mainland China and other Asian destinations because of the coronavirus, said it will restart in phases, 'with a strong 
focus on Asia, which is strategically important' for the state-controlled airline. The Helsinki-based company said it 
will fly to Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, adding it was pending government approval, but also to Nagoya, 
Osaka and Tokyo Narita in Japan; and to Singapore, Seoul and Bangkok. 'We expect aviation to recover gradually, 
starting in July', Finnair Chief Commercial Officer Ole Orver said in a statement. "Our intention is to operate 
approximately 30% of our normal amount of flights in July, and we will also start long-haul flights to our key Asian 
destinations. We will then add routes and frequencies month by month as demand recovers.' In July, Finnair would 
also resume flying to several major cities in Europe, including Berlin, Brussels, Geneva, London, Moscow, Munich, 
and Paris, as well as six domestic routes. Destinations in Spain, Italy and Poland would be added in August. Budget 
airline Ryanair, which had been the busiest carrier in Europe before the pandemic hit, has also said it is preparing 
to restart flights in July, pending an easing in lockdowns. On Monday, it said it expects a record loss of 200 billion 
euros ($220 billion) for the April-June quarter, when the heaviest restrictions on public life were implemented across 
Europe. It also expects a slow recovery, estimating it will carry only 50% of its previously forecast number of 
passengers in the fully year 2021. (Ad) He helped save America from a $1.3 trillion banking crisis I predicted the

Ryanair struggles on without state aid, but still well placed to fly high again

May 18, 2020( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Like 
other airlines, the COVID-19 crisis is going to cost Ryanair a fortune as its latest results show. Yet even though it 
won't be tapping state funds like its rivals, it is still well-placed to come through the storm."Lufthansa is going 
around hoovering up state aid like the drunken uncle at the end of a wedding, drinking from all the empty glasses. 
They can't help themselves."Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary rarely attempts to hide his contempt for national flag 
carriers like Lufthansa, as the above quote, which he gave to Bloomberg, attests to.He went even further when he 
spoke to Sky News in the UK, comparing the airline to a "crack cocaine junkie" due to the fact that it has asked the 
German government to provide a €10 billion ($10.8 billion) rescue package on top of the short-time work provisions 
it was already availing of.Ryanair and its loquacious CEO has stepped up criticism of flag carriers such as 
Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, Alitalia and others since the COVID-19 crisis prompted a raft of state interventions into 
the airline sector.At the release of its financial results on Monday, the Dublin-based airline insisted it would not be 
seeking any government support as it tries to make it through the crisis, which has caused serious financial 
problems for the aviation sector as lockdown restrictions have dramatically impacted international travel.A bad 
quarter aheadRyanair has been one of the big success stories in global aviation in the last 20 years yet even 
though it appears capable of weathering the crisis on its own, the results it presented on Monday illustrate how 
serious a threat the COVID-19 crisis is for the sector.It expects a €200 million loss for its fiscal first quarter (April-
June), the period in which restrictions are most stringent and in which it expects to operate less than 1 per cent of 
its scheduled flying programme.Ryanair did not provide any profit guidance for the 2020-21 fiscal year but it did say 
it expects to carry almost 50% less passengers by March 2021 than it would have otherwise, down to 80 million 
from its original goal of 154 million.Earlier in May, Ryanair announced its plan to resume operating up to 40% of its 
normal flight schedule from July 1, an ambitious goal given the extent to which travel restrictions are still likely to be 
in place across Europe by then, as well as complications over hygiene and social distancing.Several have 
questioned the viability of Ryanair's plan but O'Leary and the airline have been equally strident in their views 
regarding proposals around 14-day quarantining and the prospect of middle seats being taken out of airplanes in 
order to facilitate social distancing.O'Leary described UK government plans around 14-day quarantining after flying 
as "idiotic", and used the same word to describe the proposed removal of seats from aircrafts.The state of aidAs 
part of its own plan to cope, Ryanair plans to cut around 3,000 jobs. 
It has also instituted plans for wholesale unpaid leave and for significant paycuts, including a 50% paycut for 
O'Leary itself.While O'Leary has never shied from speaking in an uncomplimentary way about the likes of 
Lufthansa, as often for publicity purposes as anything else, the issue of state aid at the moment genuinely rankles 
Ryanair struggles on without state aid, but still well placed to fly high again
with him.Ryanair has a long running rivalry with Lufthansa. By most metrics, the two airline groups are comfortably 
the largest in Europe but O'Leary's view is that Lufthansa is artificially propped up by state support in a way that 
unfairly protects it.While no deal has been done yet between the German government, Lufthansa is likely to receive 
a substantial aid package of some kind in the coming weeks. It is also negotiating with the Belgian and Austrian 
governments for similar supports, where two airlines it owns, Brussels Airlines and Austrian Airlines, are 
based.Several other big European carriers have already tapped funds unavailable to the likes of Ryanair. France 
has already agreed to funnel €7 billion in cheap loans to Air France while the Dutch government will provide 
between €2 billion and €4 billion to KLM, which is joined with Air France since a 2004 merger, of which the French 
and Dutch governments each hold 14% stakes.Crisis equals opportunity?Quite what the European aviation sector 
will look like once the crisis has passed is hard to envisage. O'Leary has suggested that large airlines propped up 
with state aid will simply use the crisis to drown out competition in a post-COVID world.But Ryanair has proven 
adept in profiting from a crisis itself in the past.After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the airline sector faced a 
similar level of crisis as today. O'Leary responded with massive seat sales, which proved successful. His current 
instinct is similar to the one he had back then - that passengers will be eager to fly as soon as they are allowed to, 
as long as the price is right.Few European airlines came into the crisis as well-insulated as the Irish low-cost carrier. 
In its results on Monday, it posted a €1bn post-tax profit for the year to March 2020. Despite the fact that 
groundings were already in place by March, that figure is 13% higher than the previous year, an illustration of just 
how profitable Ryanair is in "normal" times. And things were hardly normal in 2019 either, what with Boeing's 
problems.That has helped it build cash reserves of €4 billion, a handy tool with which to deal with the mammoth 
cost of having to keep 450 airplanes on the ground.While such a situation can't go on forever, if Ryanair manages 
its current plan of having up to 50% of its original target back in the air for the July-September quarter, it will already 
be well on the way to emerging from the clouds of a crisis that many other airlines may never slip out from under.

the train timings outside a railway station during extended lockdown in New Delhi, India, Monday, May 18, 2020. 
India has recorded its biggest single-day surge in new cases of coronavirus. The surge in infections comes a day 
after the federal government extended a nationwide lockdown to May 31 but eased some restrictions to restore 
economic activity and gave states more control in deciding the nature of the lockdown. (AP Photo/Manish 
Swarup)The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for 
most people. 
For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or 
death. TOP OF THE HOUR: — Japan plunges into recession as US states start opening up. — Greece reopens 
Acropolis in Athens and other ancient sites. — European leaders consult on possibility of summer vacations. — 
India reports 5,242 new cases, largest single-day surge, and 157 deaths. ___ LONDON —The boss of budget 
airline Ryanair slammed the UK government's plan to impose a 14-day quarantine on international travelers, 
claiming the proposals have no scientific basis. Michael O'Leary told the BBC on Monday that using face masks 
instead would 'eliminate' the risk of spreading coronavirus. His comments come days after the airline announced 
plans to ramp up its schedule starting in July. Britain's government has outlined plans for visitors to have a two-
week quarantine either in accommodation of their choice or provided by the government as a last resort, but an 
implementation date has not yet been announced. O'Leary described the idea as 'idiotic'' and 'unimplementable.'' 
___ BELGRADE, Serbia — Limited commercial air traffic has resumed at Serbia's main airport after authorities 
eased the lockdown against the new coronavirus. One flight is scheduled on Monday with Wizz Air flying from 
London's Luton Airport to Belgrade's Nikola Tesla airport and back. The airport has said that travel will resume 
gradually and under strict rules. Only passengers with tickets are allowed into the airport building and the use of 
protective gear and hand sanitizers is mandatory. (Ad) Pro trader Alan Knuckman has been saying it for years... 
'DON'T BUY STOCKS!' And right now could be the best time for you to listen. Luckily, Alan just released details on 
a brand-new opportunity for anyone savvy enough to hear him out.The country of 7 million people has reported 
10,610 cases and 230 deaths. ___ BERLIN — German authorities say an outbreak of the coronavirus at a home for 
asylum seekers in a western town is under control after more than half the residents tested positive for COVID-19. 
Vanessa Nolte, a spokeswoman for city of Cologne, said Monday all 312 residents of the home in nearby Sankt 
Augustin have been tested since the virus was first detected there late last week. The facility was home to primarily 
younger people and families of various nationalities seeking asylum. A total of 170 tested positive for the virus, but 
none have required hospitalization. ___ MOSCOW — Moscow health officials say 77 people died of coronavirus in 
The Latest: Outbreak at German asylum center under control
the city in the past 24 hours, the highest daily number for the Russian capital so far.  With a total of over 146,000 
confirmed infections and 1,580 deaths, Russia's capital currently accounts for more than half of the country's virus 
cases and 58% of all reported deaths.  Russia's caseload surpassed 290,000 on Monday, with the death toll 
exceeding 2,700. The country's comparatively low death rate has raised questions in the West, with experts 
suggesting Russia may be under-reporting deaths.  Russian officials vehemently deny these allegations and 
attribute the relatively low number of COVID-19 deaths to measures the country has taken to curb the spread of the 
virus. ___ LONDON — Ireland is taking its first steps out of lockdown, with some stores re-opening and outdoor 
work resuming after shutting down amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Garden centers, hardware stores and opticians 
are among the businesses being allowed to open Monday as the lockdown eased. People are being urged to wear 
face coverings when going to shops or using public transport. Health Minister Simon Harris told RTE radio that he's 
nervous, because the virus has not gone away. Nonetheless, Harris hopes that social distancing and other 
measures will make more normalcy possible. He says that if Ireland can get the next three weeks right 'we as a 
country will find a way to live safely alongside the virus.' ___ COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Church services are 
resuming in Denmark but with new guidelines dictating one meter (3.3. feet) between worshipers when they pray 
and two meters when they sing.  The Danish church affairs minister, Joy Mogensen, said it 'is important that both 
the national church and other faith communities are conscious of following the guidelines closely.' 'And I still 
encourage everyone to use common sense and apply a precautionary principle when planning local activities 
again,' she said. More than 80% of Denmark's population belongs to the State Evangelical Lutheran Church, though 
only about 5% attend church services regularly. On top of that cafes and restaurants are also to reopen as well as 
upper school classes — sixth to 10th grade. The easing up of restrictions comes as infections levels in Denmark 
have fallen to their lowest level in two months. ___ MOSCOW — Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan started gradually 
easing some of their lockdown restrictions as the spread of the coronavirus slows in two ex-Soviet nations slows 
down.  In Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan's capital, mosques, markets cafes and restaurants with no more than 50 seats 
and kindergartens with groups for no more than 15 children reopened on Monday.  In Azerbaijan, cafes and 
restaurants reopened in the capital, Baku, and four others cities, and people were allowed to walk in parks in 
groups of up to 10 people.  Kazakhstan has so far reported more than 6,100 confirmed coronavirus cases, with the 
growth rate slowing down in recent weeks. Authorities in Azerbaijan have registered more than 3,200 cases. ___ 
BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping will speak at the opening ceremony of the World Health Organization's 
annual meeting later Monday. China's foreign ministry said that he would address the World Health Assembly by 
videolink. The conference is being held virtually this year because of the coronavirus. The WHO has been drawn 
into a blame game between the U.S. and China over the spread of the virus. President Donald Trump has 
withdrawn U.S. funding for the U.N. organization, saying it was too accepting of China's handling of the outbreak 
early on. China has defended its record and said it has worked closely with the WHO and will continue to do so to 
respond to the pandemic ___ VATICAN CITY — Italy and the Vatican are opening a new post-lockdown phase in 
the virus emergency, with churches resuming public Masses after a sharp confrontation between the Italian 
government and the country's bishops over worshiping in the era of coronavirus. Guards in hazmat suits took the 
temperature of the faithful entering St. Peter's Basilica, where Pope Francis celebrated an early morning Mass for a 
handful of people in a side chapel to commemorate the centenary of the birth of St. John Paul II. Across town, the 
Rev. Jose Maria Galvan snapped on a latex glove and face mask before distributing Communion to the dozen 
parishioners attending the 7:20 a.m. Mass at his Sant'Eugenio parish.  'Before I became a priest I was a surgeon, 
so for me gloves are normal,' he joked afterward. 'I'm dexterous (with gloves) so the hosts don't get away from me.' 
It was all part of Italy's next step in emerging from the West's first coronavirus lockdown, with commercial shops 
reopening and barbers and bartenders going back at work. But they are doing so under strict rules that regulate 
everything from how you get your coffee to the way you pray. ___ BRUSSELS — The European Medicines 
Agency's executive director says a coronavirus vaccine won't be available soon and that even when one is ready, 
production won't be sufficient to offer protection to the entire world's population. Guido Rasi said Monday in a 
session with European lawmakers that a vaccine against the deadly virus is one year away at best. Even then, Rasi 
said there won't be enough doses for the entire population. He said a coordinated approach at the European level 
will be key to identifying those who will benefit the most from the vaccine. 'We will need to have one holistic model 
to create the first ring of defense in the general population,' he said. ___ CANBERRA, Australia — Australia's 
government welcomed international support for an independent investigation of the coronavirus pandemic, a 
proposed inquiry that has been condemned by China and blamed for a bilateral trade rift. The European Union has 
drafted a resolution, cosponsored by dozens of countries including Australia, that has been gaining support and is 
The Latest: Outbreak at German asylum center under control
expected to be approved in a vote at the World Health Assembly in Geneva this week. The resolution before the 
assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization, calls for an evaluation of the origins of the 
pandemic and responses to it. Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Monday her government had been 
keen to ensure that the resolution stipulates the inquiry be 'impartial, independent and comprehensive.' 'We're very 
encouraged by the growing levels of support for this comprehensive World Health Assembly motion,' Payne told 
reporters. 'We look forward to seeing hopefully a positive outcome later this week.' Australia has been seen as a 
leader in rallying global support for such an inquiry, attracting Chinese criticism that it is parroting the United States 
and inviting a Chinese boycott of exports and services.  The motion comes as Australia struggles to resolve a 
dispute with China over beef imports. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said he's been unable to speak with his 
Chinese counterpart about China's ban on meat from Australia's four largest abattoirs over labeling issues. ___ 
ATHENS, Greece — Greece reopened the Acropolis in Athens and other ancient sites Monday, along with high 
schools, shopping malls and mainland travel in the latest round of easing pandemic restrictions imposed in late 
March. Paving stickers were used as markers to keep visitors apart outside the Acropolis, while students were 
placed on rotation with online teaching to keep classes below 50% capacity. Public compliance with strict lockdown 
measures helped keep the COVID-19 death toll to 166 while the total number of confirmed cases stood at 2,834 on 
Sunday. But authorities are keen to reopen the vital tourism sector, following a warning by the EU Commission that 
Greece is likely to suffer the worst recession in the bloc this year. Public beaches reopened over the weekend amid 
heatwave temperatures, with strict distancing rules imposed by the government, but crowding did occur on buses 
from Athens to the nearby coast. Travel to the Greek islands remains broadly restricted. ___ BERLIN — Germany's 
foreign minister is consulting with 10 European colleagues on how to go about making summer vacations 
elsewhere on the continent possible. Germany's two-month-old warning against tourist travel to any country is due 
to expire on June 14. It and other countries aim to restore free travel across their borders next month. Foreign 
Minister Heiko Maas planned a video conference Monday with counterparts from 10 countries that are popular 
destinations for Germans. He told ZDF television that 'we want to discuss under what criteria a summer vacation 
could be possible' - including issues such as entry rules and quarantine requirements that some nations have 
imposed. Maas said countries also will have to agree on a mechanism 'to react very quickly' if coronavirus 
infections surge again. He added that 'even if a summer vacation will be possible elsewhere in Europe, which I 
hope, one has to say that this vacation this year won't be like the ones we know from the past, because the 
pandemic is still there and we must at least have safety precautions for the worst case that the figures get worse 
again.'  ___ BRUSSELS — Belgium took the next step in its relaxation of the country's coronavirus lockdown on 
Monday, with more students going to school, and markets and museums reopening. Schools were permitted to go 
through a dry run on Friday, but primary and secondary classes resumed for real Monday with a limited amount of 
pupils to make sure social distancing was fully respected. In many cases, though, distance learning on laptops 
remained the order of the day. Barbers can also resume work, even though Monday used to be their traditional day 
off. Both barber and client will have to wear protective masks. Hoping to make the most of the sunny weather, 
open-air markets can start selling the plentiful spring fruits and vegetables. And zoo animals, bereft of visitors since 
March, will have eyes on them again as parks can reopen. Museums will reopen as well and, like zoos, will have a 
strict reservation system to avoid overcrowding. ___ KEY WEST, Fla. — The Florida Keys will reopen to tourists on 
June 1, more than two months after the island chain closed to visitors to minimize the spread of the coronavirus.  
Checkpoints that barred visitors from coming into the Florida Keys will be removed next month, Monroe County 
Emergency Management said in a statement Sunday. Hotels and other lodging establishments will also be allowed 
to reopen at 50% occupancy, the statement said.  Those businesses must implement sanitation stations and follow 
the American Hotel and Lodging Association's cleaning guidelines for COVID-19. The Florida Keys have been 
closed to visitors since March 22. ___ NEW DELHI, India — India has recorded its biggest single-day surge with 
5,242 new cases of coronavirus and 157 deaths due to COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, taking the country's infection 
tally to more than 96,000, the most in Asia. The country now has 3,029 reported fatalities due to COVID-19.  The 
surge in infections comes a day after the federal government extended a nationwide lockdown to May 31 but eased 
some restrictions to restore economic activity and gave states more control in deciding the nature of the lockdown. 
Authorities are largely attributing the recent surge in infections to the return of hundreds of thousands of migrant 
workers to India's villages, which have weaker health infrastructure. India had eased its lockdown rules on May 4 
and even allowed migrant workers to travel back to their homes, a decision that has resulted in millions of people 
being on the move for the last two weeks. All domestic and international passenger flights remain prohibited in the 
country. Metro services, schools, colleges, hotels and restaurants also remain shuttered nationwide. Most of the 
The Latest: Outbreak at German asylum center under control
infections reported in India are from its major cities. Mumbai, the financial capital and home to Bollywood, alone has 
registered almost 20% of the total cases. ___ MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan — The government in the Pakistani-
administered sector of Kashmir announced it is reimposing full lockdown measures beginning Monday night after 
several people tested positive for the new coronavirus. The move came days after about two dozen more people 
tested positive in Pakistan-held Kashmir, where so far 112 confirmed cases have been reported. The region has 
reported only one coronavirus-related death. The lockdown was imposed in Pakistan-held Kashmir in March to 
contain the spread of the virus. But it was eased in April. Kashmir is a split between Pakistan and neighboring India 
but claimed by both in its entirety. The announcement came as Pakistan reported 30 more deaths from the new 
coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, raising overall fatalities in the country to 903. So far, 42,125 confirmed cases 
have been reported in Pakistan, a total that includes the 112 infections in Pakistan-held Kashmir. ___ Follow AP

May 18, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; Ryanair expects to 
be flying 50% of its usual capacity by late summer 2020, a more bullish forecast than most predict.CEO Michael 
O'Leary says holidaymakers will fuel the return, as they seek sunny beaches of Spain and Portugal.He also blasted 
mandatory quarantine periods as "idiotic" in a CNBC interview Monday.[1]Visit Business Insider's homepage for 
more stories[2]. Ryanair remains surprisingly optimistic in the face of thousands of layoffs and the number of its 
scheduled flights being reduced to a tiny percentage of the usual.Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the Irish 
budget carrier, told CNBC Monday that he still expects many families to still take summer holidays to warmer 
European locations with beaches, like Spain and Portugal. That should help traffic tick up from the 1% of usual 
service Ryanair ran in May."At best we think we're talking about 50% of our normal traffic in the months of July, 
August, September," he said. 
"And then maybe a return to some degree of normality as the schools go back."O'Leary, who's garnered a 
reputation in recent months for lively interviews[3]regarding the coronavirus' dramatic effect on global air travel, also 
blasted government quarantine policies for overseas travelers entering the United Kingdom."What's likely is, as 
extensions ease or lose credibility, such as the 14-day lockdown, I think you will see people return in quite quick 
numbers," he said, noting that government ministers seem to be "making this stuff up as they go along."Italy, he 
said, has taken the right approach."They removed this idiotic 14-day isolation that is both unimplementable and 
unmanageable, in favorof using masks and temperature checks," he said.More effective, he said, are face-masks, 
which both passengers and crew will be required to wear."The reality is face masks, as demonstrated in Asia, if 
both a covid sufferer and and a non-covid sufferer are both wearing face masks you reduce the risk of transmission 
by 98%," he said."It will be a different experience," O'Leary said. "But I think confidence will restore pretty quickly. 
Then I think numbers will be stimulated by very low cost air fares." Loading Something is loading.    Do you have a

       Emirates Group plans to cut about 30,000 jobs, due to the coronavirus crisis that affects the entire travel and 
aviation industry, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter.
 The Dubai-based airliner could eliminate the number of employees by about 30% from more than 105,000 at the 
end of March. Emirates is also considering accelerating the retirement of its fleet of Airbus SE A380s, the report 
said.
 Earlier this month, Ryanair Airlines had said it plans a restructuring and job loss program to commence from July 
2020, which may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs.
 Last month, British Airways announced plans to cut nearly 12,000 jobs at the UK carrier as Covid-19 pandemic 
continues to wreak havoc on the aviation industry.

? BP's chief executive said the hit to crude consumption was likely to endure beyond the pandemic and might have 
ushered in "peak oil" demand.
Bernard Looney warned that the crisis was "adding to the challenges of oil in the years ahead" as travel bans and 
lockdowns slash consumption by a third from pre-crisis levels of roughly 100m barrels a day.
He said: "It's not going to make oil more in demand. It's gotten more likely [oil will] be less in demand."
? BlackRock's top shareholder, PNC Financial, announced it was selling its $17bn stake in the asset manager, 
freeing up the bank to pursue potential acquisitions. The bank holds a 22 per cent stake in the company that it 
purchased in 1995.
?The planned $9bn acquisition of Bermuda reinsurer PartnerRe has collapsed after France's Covéa said it was no 
longer willing to go ahead on the terms agreed in March with Italy's Exor.
Privately held Covéa blamed the decision on uncertainties in the economic outlook.
? The Body Shop is to resume direct selling in the US after more than a decade's absence to help mitigate revenue 
lost from stores closed by the pandemic.
The UK chain, founded by Anita Roddick in 1976 and owned by Brazil health group Natura, said direct sales in its 
home market had risen 80 per cent this year, accounting for 30 per cent of UK revenues, compared with 20 per cent 
before the outbreak.

? Nissan is in talks to shift production of two Renault models from Spain to its Sunderland plant in the UK, securing 
thousands of British manufacturing jobs.
The Japanese and French groups are discussing moving production of the Renault Kadjar and Captur models as 
part of an overhaul of operations.
? Brookfield Asset Management has unveiled changes to its unusual ownership structure that for decades has 
given a group of partners the right to wield great influence. The firm's special class of shares will be placed in a trust 
controlled by Bruce Flatt, Brookfield's chief executive, and six other company officials, all of whom have been 
named.
? Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary branded the 14-day quarantine plan on passengers arriving in the UK 
"nonsense" with no scientific basis as the airline pledged to resume 40 per cent of flights from July from most of its 
80 bases across the continent.
? KKR has agreed to inject $750m into debt-laden cosmetics maker Coty in the first step towards a broader deal 
that would see the US private equity group buy a majority stake in the company's professional beauty and haircare

? BP's chief executive said the hit to crude consumption was likely to endure beyond the pandemic and might have 
ushered in "peak oil" demand.
Bernard Looney warned that the crisis was "adding to the challenges of oil in the years ahead" as travel bans and 
lockdowns slash consumption by a third from pre-crisis levels of roughly 100m barrels a day.
He said: "It's not going to make oil more in demand. It's gotten more likely [oil will] be less in demand."
? BlackRock's top shareholder, PNC Financial, announced it was selling its $17bn stake in the asset manager, 
freeing up the bank to pursue potential acquisitions. The bank holds a 22 per cent stake in the company that it 
purchased in 1995.
? The planned $9bn acquisition of Bermuda reinsurer PartnerRe has collapsed after France's Covéa said it was no 
longer willing to go ahead on the terms agreed in March with Italy's Exor.
Privately held Covéa blamed the decision on uncertainties in the economic outlook.
? The Body Shop is to resume direct selling in the US after more than a decade's absence to help mitigate revenue 
lost from stores closed by the pandemic.
The UK chain, founded by Anita Roddick in 1976 and owned by Brazil health group Natura, said direct sales in its 
home market had risen 80 per cent this year, accounting for 30 per cent of UK revenues, compared with 20 per cent 
before the outbreak.

? Nissan is in talks to shift production of two Renault models from Spain to its Sunderland plant in the UK, securing 
thousands of British manufacturing jobs.
The Japanese and French groups are discussing moving production of the Renault Kadjar and Captur models as 
part of an overhaul of operations.
? Brookfield Asset Management has unveiled changes to its unusual ownership structure that for decades has 
given a group of partners the right to wield great influence. The firm's special class of shares will be placed in a trust 
controlled by Bruce Flatt, Brookfield's chief executive, and six other company officials, all of whom have been 
named.
? Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary branded the 14-day quarantine plan on passengers arriving in the UK 
"nonsense" with no scientific basis as the airline pledged to resume 40 per cent of flights from July from most of its 
80 bases across the continent.
? KKR has agreed to inject $750m into debt-laden cosmetics maker Coty in the first step towards a broader deal 
that would see the US private equity group buy a majority stake in the company's professional beauty and haircare 
division.
? Deutsche Bank has restarted its job cuts six weeks after suspending redundancies, as it tries to rein in costs and 
keep its restructuring on course.
? Norway's oil fund has sold out of some of the biggest names in commodities and utilities including Glencore, 
Anglo American and RWE after deciding they breached its environmental guidelines.

Will we be able to go on holiday this summer? The travel outlook for 2020

Around the world, bars, restaurants, hotels and visitor attractions are being reopened as lockdowns are gradually 
lifted. The waiters are polishing the glasses in beachside tavernas and the tour operators and airlines that hope to 
take us there have been offering upbeat predictions. "Summer holidays are possible," said Fritz Joussen, chief 
executive of Tui, Europe's biggest travel operator, on Wednesday. "People want to travel - Europe must now 
gradually open." A day earlier, Ryanair had announced it would be resuming 40 per cent of flights in July. "It is time 
to get Europe flying again," said chief executive Eddie Wilson.
The problem is that, though the travel industry is ready, eager and willing, there is no clarity on when governments 
will give the green light. Bars and hotels in some of the Canary Islands have been open since May 4, for example, 
but if tourists from the UK - by far the biggest source market - attempted to visit this weekend they would be 
breaking the law before they had even reached the airport. Nor would they be able to get travel insurance for the 
trip, and they would be forced into selfquarantine for two weeks on arrival in Spain.
Even where governments are determined to open their doors, hurdles remain. Iceland, where international tourism 
accounts for more than 40 per cent of foreign earnings (and where the tiny population means domestic holidays 
cannot take up the slack), announced this week that it would be easing restrictions on international travel no later 
than June 15. From that date, tourists will be able to avoid quarantine by taking a Covid-19 test on arrival, while 
probably also being asked to download a track-and-trace app. The country has recorded only three cases of the 
virus this month (and only 10 deaths since the start of the crisis), and the chance to see its thrilling landscapes 
without crowds is an attractive prospect. But will potential tourists' home countries allow them to go? Iceland's key 
markets are the UK and US. Though details are yet to be released, UK visitors are soon likely to face a 14-day 
quarantine on arriving home, while there is no date announced for when the US ban on flights to and from Europe 
Will we be able to go on holiday this summer? The travel outlook for 2020
and europe might be lifted. Asked if international travel would be opened up this year Steven Mnuchin, the US 
Treasury secretary, said it was "too hard to tell at this point" and that the priority was opening the domestic 
economy.
Attempting to bring some clarity, on Wednesday the EU published a plan to "reboot" Europe's tourism. It proposes a 
co-ordinated approach in which member states with similar epidemiological conditions lift restrictions at the same 
time. In other parts of the world, countries with low infection rates are also working to set up quarantine-free 
"bubbles" or "corridors". Australia and New Zealand have agreed to establish a "Trans-Tasman travel bubble", as 
soon as safely possible, while Israel, Greece and Cyprus have discussed a tourism safe zone in the eastern 
Mediterranean.
Travellers between the UK and Ireland will not be subject to a quarantine, and the UK and France have also agreed 
an exemption - prompting much excitement at the prospect of holidays between the two countries. Eurotunnel, 
which operates car-carrying trains through the Channel tunnel, saw a spike in calls and website traffic this week. 
Eurocamp, a British company that offers camping holidays across Europe, this week saw a doubling in searches for 
trips in September and October, with northern France most in demand. However, there is still no guarantee when 
travel between the countries might be possible - France's "state of health emergency" continues until at least mid-
July, and restrictions on travel within the country remain in place.
That leaves one option likely to be the most reliable for this summer: a holiday in your home country. Classic 
Cottages, which rents 1,100 properties in England, saw a 63 per cent rise in reservations this week compared to 
last. Indie Campers, which rents campervans in 14 countries, says it has seen a boost in bookings over the last 10 
days, driven by domestic trips - they account for 73 per cent of reservations this month compared with 24 per cent 
in May 2019.
Perhaps a camper van, parked up on a lonely beach or mountain road, could be the perfect solution to the socially 
distanced summer holiday of 2020.

Coronavirus crisis is strengthening the hand of ESG investors
Coronavirus crisis is strengthening the hand of ESG investors

A few months ago, it seemed as if the fight against climate change had built real momentum. Now, with coronavirus 
bringing global commerce to a halt, sustainability is feeling like an unaffordable luxury for some cash-strapped 
companies.
"I suspect an awful lot of the environmental agenda and targets will be put on the back burner for a number of 
years," said Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, the Irish carrier, at an event hosted this week by the 
Financial Times. "[That is] not because we all care less about the environment. I think the much greater political 
issue is going to be massive unemployment across Europe [and] massive government indebtedness."
With companies in danger of going under entirely, it seems reasonable to wonder how much executives will worry 
about renewable energy or planting trees. Yet Mr O'Leary's assertion may be misguided. For starters, the EU is 
looking to make emissions cuts a prerequisite for any bailout of airlines. It has also shown no indication of retreating 
from its wider climate ambitions. Meanwhile, investors are also still going all in on environmental, social and 
governance themes - and so far their bets have paid off.
If anything, the pandemic has only reinforced fund managers' belief that ESG is worth worrying about.
Sustainability-themed funds saw record inflows in the US in the first quarter while the rest of the market saw 
hundreds of billions of dollars of outflows, according to data provider Morningstar.
Coronavirus crisis is strengthening the hand of ESG investors
On top of that, many ESG indices held up better through the downturn than their broad-market counterparts. 
"Talking to clients across the board, the reasons they want to integrate ESG have been supported and amplified by 
the crisis," said Ted Eliopoulos, co-chair of the sustainable investing council at Morgan Stanley Investment 
Management. "The intensity in interest has also increased."
For Mr Eliopoulos, screening for companies with high ESG scores is simply a way to find good executive teams.
He argues that companies that consider environmental and social factors - and abide by good standards of 
corporate governance - should be better equipped to ride out a downturn and quickly get back up to speed.
As such, the Covid-19 crisis will serve as a good "laboratory" to test the theories underpinning ESG investing, he 
said. "We'll see [which companies] were able to anticipate, mitigate, and manage through this crisis better or 
worse."
Investors have not let up on their efforts to push companies to be more responsible. Two out of every three 
proposals from shareholders submitted for annual meetings this year address environmental or social matters, 
according to Nuveen, an asset manager.
To be sure, many of those proposals were filed long before the pandemic but there has also been no sign that 
activists are willing to let them drop. Just this week, Legal &General Investment Management, the UK's largest 
asset manager, said it would vote against the chair of ExxonMobil because of a "lack of strategic ambition around 
climate change". Climate-conscious shareholders also racked up a victory this month when JPMorgan Chase 
announced it would demote Lee Raymond, former chief of ExxonMobil, from his position as lead independent 
director.
It is also clear that many companies do not see matters of sustainability as a serious burden. In the US, a group of 
more than 300 companies, including Microsoft and Mars, this week called on the federal government to pass a 
carbon tax and to put green projects at the heart of its coronavirus recovery plans.
Even within the aviation sector, there is still a push towards decarbonisation. Airlines for America, a trade group, 
announced this week the approval of a new blend of sustainable aviation fuel.
Despite all of this, could Mr O'Leary still be right? Of course bankruptcies and unemployment could make 
governments, companies and investors prioritise growth by any means necessary. There will be some tough 
decisions as companies fight for survival, said Mr Eliopoulos. But he argued that sustainability is a long-term play.
Nothing about the coronavirus crisis will dislodge the "secular trend" of companies taking sustainability seriously, 
agreed James Rich, senior portfolio manager at Aegon Asset Management in Chicago. The link between 
sustainability and index-beating returns is clear, he said. "If anything it has probably put a period at the end of that 
sentence."

Coronavirus crisis is strengthening the hand of ESG investors

A few months ago, it seemed as if the fight against climate change had built real momentum. Now, with coronavirus 
bringing global commerce to a halt, sustainability is feeling like an unaffordable luxury for some cash-strapped 
companies.
"I suspect an awful lot of the environmental agenda and targets will be put on the back burner for a number of 
years," said Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, the Irish carrier, at an event hosted this week by the 
Financial Times. "[That is] not because we all care less about the environment. I think the much greater political 
issue is going to be massive unemployment across Europe [and] massive government indebtedness."
With companies in danger of going under entirely, it seems reasonable to wonder how much executives will worry 
about renewable energy or planting trees. Yet Mr O'Leary's assertion may be misguided. For starters, the EU is 
looking to make emissions cuts a prerequisite for any bailout of airlines. It has also shown no indication of retreating 
from its wider climate ambitions. Meanwhile, investors are also still going all in on environmental, social and 
governance themes - and so far their bets have paid off.
If anything, the pandemic has only reinforced fund managers' belief that ESG is worth worrying about.
Sustainability-themed funds saw record inflows in the US in the first quarter while the rest of the market saw 
hundreds of billions of dollars of outflows, according to data provider Morningstar.
Coronavirus crisis is strengthening the hand of ESG investors
On top of that, many ESG indices held up better through the downturn than their broad-market counterparts. 
"Talking to clients across the board, the reasons they want to integrate ESG have been supported and amplified by 
the crisis," said Ted Eliopoulos, co-chair of the sustainable investing council at Morgan Stanley Investment 
Management. "The intensity in interest has also increased."
For Mr Eliopoulos, screening for companies with high ESG scores is simply a way to find good executive teams.
He argues that companies that consider environmental and social factors - and abide by good standards of 
corporate governance - should be better equipped to ride out a downturn and quickly get back up to speed.
As such, the Covid-19 crisis will serve as a good "laboratory" to test the theories underpinning ESG investing, he 
said. "We'll see [which companies] were able to anticipate, mitigate, and manage through this crisis better or 
worse."
Investors have not let up on their efforts to push companies to be more responsible. Two out of every three 
proposals from shareholders submitted for annual meetings this year address environmental or social matters, 
according to Nuveen, an asset manager.
To be sure, many of those proposals were filed long before the pandemic but there has also been no sign that 
activists are willing to let them drop. Just this week, Legal &General Investment Management, the UK's largest 
asset manager, said it would vote against the chair of ExxonMobil because of a "lack of strategic ambition around 
climate change". Climate-conscious shareholders also racked up a victory this month when JPMorgan Chase 
announced it would demote Lee Raymond, former chief of ExxonMobil, from his position as lead independent 
director.
It is also clear that many companies do not see matters of sustainability as a serious burden. In the US, a group of 
more than 300 companies, including Microsoft and Mars, this week called on the federal government to pass a 
carbon tax and to put green projects at the heart of its coronavirus recovery plans.
Even within the aviation sector, there is still a push towards decarbonisation. Airlines for America, a trade group, 
announced this week the approval of a new blend of sustainable aviation fuel.
Despite all of this, could Mr O'Leary still be right? Of course bankruptcies and unemployment could make 
governments, companies and investors prioritise growth by any means necessary. There will be some tough 
decisions as companies fight for survival, said Mr Eliopoulos. But he argued that sustainability is a long-term play.
Nothing about the coronavirus crisis will dislodge the "secular trend" of companies taking sustainability seriously, 
agreed James Rich, senior portfolio manager at Aegon Asset Management in Chicago. The link between 
sustainability and index-beating returns is clear, he said. "If anything it has probably put a period at the end of that 
sentence."

Ryanair to cut over 250 jobs

Ryanair today confirmed it has reduced its office headcount in Dublin, Stansted, Madrid and Wroclaw by over 250 
through a combination of probation/fixed term contract ends, resignations and redundancies.
Ryanair says as these people will not be required to return to work on 1 June, when the Ryanair offices reopen, due 
to the substantial decline in traffic the Ryanair Group Airlines is facing in 2020.
The airline has operated less than 1% of their normal flight schedules during April, May and June, and this week 
announced that only 40% of its normal schedules would operate in July 2020. For the full year, Ryanair now 
expects to carry less than 100 million passengers, over 35% lower than the 155m+ target for the year ended March 
2021.
Speaking this week, Ryanair’s People Director, Darrell Hughes said, "This is a very painful time for Ryanair, our 
crews and our people supporting operations from our Dublin, Stansted, Madrid and Wroclaw offices. While we 
expect to re-open our offices from 1 June next, we will not require the same number of support team members in a 
year when we will carry less than 100m passengers, against an original budget of 155m."
He added, "Regrettably, we will now have a small number of compulsory redundancies in Dublin, Stansted, Madrid 
and Wroclaw to right size our support teams for a year when we will carry less than 100m passengers due to the 
Covid-19 crisis. These job losses were communicated to individual team members this week, and they will not be 
returning to work in our Dublin, Stansted, Madrid or Wroclaw offices when they reopen on 1 June next."

Ryanair sues Air France - KLM over state tax breaks
Ryanair sues Air France-KLM over state tax breaks

Ryanair Holdings filed a lawsuit at the European Union's General Court on May 11 to challenge the French 
government's support for Air France-KLM and other French airlines, according to a report on Bloomberg. The ultra-
low-cost carrier (ULCC) is seeking to overturn the EU's approval for a programme giving considerable aviation tax 
refunds "only to French airlines." The programme will see the French government allowing "French" airlines to defer 
around EUR200 million euro (USD217 million) in aviation tax payments due from March until December this year 
until the end of 2022. The Irish airline believes that the tax break will mostly benefit Air France (AF, Paris CDG) but 
"all other EU airlines flying in France (such as Ryanair, easyJet, and British Airways) must still pay these taxes. This 
bailout discrimination is clearly in breach of state aid and competition rules." Ryanair has also complained that 
similar Swedish and Danish programmes unfairly discriminate against other European carriers. The European 
Commission has already approved, under relaxed EU state aid rules, a EUR7 billion euro (USD7.64 billion) French 
guarantee and shareholder loan for Air France to ensure it has enough liquidity to survive the global crisis.

The last time the US government pumped billions of dollars into an industry to deal with an economic crisis, it 
effectively took over two of the nation's biggest carmakers, securing large equity stakes in General Motors and 
Chrysler and forcing a painful restructuring that made them more efficient.
The Trump administration's bailout of US airlines is different. The Treasury is taking just a nominal equity interest in 
return for grants and low-interest loans, attracting criticism it has been too generous to the carriers' shareholders.
But the terms of the deal explicitly prevent executives from launching the painful restructuring other countries' 
airlines are doing, as they fight to survive in a world of much restricted air travel.
"This was a so-called bailout that required the CEOs to run their airlines in a way that no free market CEO who 
didn't have the government aid would ever do," said one of the bankers involved in negotiations between the 
Treasury and the airlines.
So far 93 US airlines have secured $12.4bn of $25bn in government funding available for payrolls, each getting 70 
per cent in the form of grants that do not have to be repaid. As well as curbing share buybacks and executive pay, 
companies that took the money agreed not to lay off staff or axe routes until September 30 - even though air

passenger volumes in the US have fallen by more than 90 per cent since March, and a V-shaped recovery is no 
longer on the cards.
European carriers have announced waves of cuts - up to 12,000 jobs at British Airway, 3,000 at Ryanair, just in the 
past fortnight - but US airlines are still at the planning stage. United's incoming chief executive, Scott Kirby, said he 
would cut cash burn from $40m a day now towards $30m a day in the third quarter and then $20m a day in the 
fourth, if travel has not rebounded.
"The difference between that thirdquarter number and that fourth-quarter number is really about employees," he told 
investors earlier this month.
Some airline bosses tried to offer the government more equity in exchange for less onerous conditions, including 
giving the carriers the flexibility to close some uneconomical flying routes and cutting jobs, said the person involved 
in the talks.
The government, however, wanted to ensure airlines would still be there at the end of the pandemic and that 
employees would be retained, even if taxpayers were funding their salaries.
"We wanted a package directed towards Americans and funnelled through airlines," said Sarah Nelson, the 
president of the Association of Flight Attendants. "It's very clear the money goes to worker wages and benefits."
Airlines benefit, too, because while the restrictions delay the reduction in cash burn, they allow carriers to gauge the 
new normal, said analyst Savanthi Syth at Raymond James. "It helps to have a little more visibility into what the 
new demand environment looks like before you make drastic changes to the business," she said.
But executives' hopes for recovery have darkened in the seven weeks since the bailout was enacted, and waiting to 
downsize carries a cost. Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik noted that, "as a shareholder or even a debt-holder, if 
you have cash in the door, and it's being used, you want that cash to be used to the highest return possible, and if 
you're keeping people and capacity which is not earning a return, then that is inefficient".
The White House relaxed minimumservice rules this week, saying it would allow some airlines to drop routes as 
long as they were served by another carrier.
Restrictions on lay-offs may not be eased, but Wall Street is in no doubt about what will happen when they end. 
JPMorgan Chase analyst Jamie Baker, in a recent note, said: "October 1 is likely to emerge as one of the darkest 
days in history for airline labour."
The taxpayer has little chance of recovering their investment, because even a strong rebound for share is likely to 
offset only some of the cost of the grants. Delta Air Lines, for example, secured $5.4bn, of which $3.8bn was a 
forgivable grant, with the rest a 10-year unsecured loan. Warrants were granted to the government for 1 per cent of 
Delta's equity, giving the Treasury the right to buy stock at April's level. Delta stock would need to multiply from $22 
now to about $575, according to FT calculations, for taxpayers to make back their outlay.
A positive outcome for airlines' shareholders is hardly certain, dependent not just on cutting cash burn before and 
after the September 30 expiry of lay-off restrictions but on finding other savings, too. Famed investor Warren Buffett 
has given up on the sector, selling his stakes in the four largest US carriers at a loss. "You've got too many planes," 
he said.
Shareholders are also reliant on airlines finding the cash to see them through whatever the pandemic throws at 
them.
The Bush and Obama administrations spent tens of billions funding the bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler when 
there was no private capital available. The Trump administration's intervention in the airline industry has not so 
much replaced private capital as helped carriers to access it. Delta raised $5bn from investors last month by 
mortgaging assets including airport landing slots, for example, and United sold $1bn of equity.
US carriers eye job cuts when bailout terms expire Airlines. Government aid ; Other nations' operators have

Airlines also have the option of further government funding from a second $25bn bailout pot, which would come not 
as grants but as secured loans. American Airlines, the most heavily indebted carrier and the only one so far to have 
said it will certainly take the second bailout, will emerge with the government holding an interest equal to 12 per 
cent of the company.
The pandemic has turned the government into a financing source of last resort for swaths of corporate America, but 
the socialisation of risk and the picking of winners and losers has concerned some.
"Equity investors get limited liability, and yet they get the upside of profits," noted Anthony Casey, a University of 
Chicago law professor. "Businesses go bad for arbitrary reasons all the time. There is no obvious reason to funnel 
money to equity investors."

The last time the US government pumped billions of dollars into an industry to deal with an economic crisis, it 
effectively took over two of the nation's biggest carmakers, securing large equity stakes in General Motors and 
Chrysler and forcing a painful restructuring that made them more efficient.
The Trump administration's bailout of US airlines is different. The Treasury is taking just a nominal equity interest in 
return for grants and low-interest loans, attracting criticism it has been too generous to the carriers' shareholders.
But the terms of the deal explicitly prevent executives from launching the painful restructuring other countries' 
airlines are doing, as they fight to survive in a world of much restricted air travel.
"This was a so-called bailout that required the CEOs to run their airlines in a way that no free market CEO who 
didn't have the government aid would ever do," said one of the bankers involved in negotiations between the 
Treasury and the airlines.
So far 93 US airlines have secured $12.4bn of $25bn in government funding available for payrolls, each getting 70 
per cent in the form of grants that do not have to be repaid. As well as curbing share buybacks and executive pay, 
companies that took the money agreed not to lay off staff or axe routes until September 30 - even though air 
US carriers eye job cuts when bailout terms expire Airlines. Government aid ; Other nations' operators have 
downsized but Treasury restrictions limit room to ac....
passenger volumes in the US have fallen by more than 90 per cent since March, and a V-shaped recovery is no 
longer on the cards.
European carriers have announced waves of cuts - up to 12,000 jobs at British Airway, 3,000 at Ryanair, just in the 
past fortnight - but US airlines are still at the planning stage. United's incoming chief executive, Scott Kirby, said he 
would cut cash burn from $40m a day now towards $30m a day in the third quarter and then $20m a day in the 
fourth, if travel has not rebounded.
"The difference between that thirdquarter number and that fourth-quarter number is really about employees," he told 
investors earlier this month.
Some airline bosses tried to offer the government more equity in exchange for less onerous conditions, including 
giving the carriers the flexibility to close some uneconomical flying routes and cutting jobs, said the person involved 
in the talks.
The government, however, wanted to ensure airlines would still be there at the end of the pandemic and that 
employees would be retained, even if taxpayers were funding their salaries.
"We wanted a package directed towards Americans and funnelled through airlines," said Sarah Nelson, the 
president of the Association of Flight Attendants. "It's very clear the money goes to worker wages and benefits."
Airlines benefit, too, because while the restrictions delay the reduction in cash burn, they allow carriers to gauge the 
new normal, said analyst Savanthi Syth at Raymond James. "It helps to have a little more visibility into what the 
new demand environment looks like before you make drastic changes to the business," she said.
But executives' hopes for recovery have darkened in the seven weeks since the bailout was enacted, and waiting to 
downsize carries a cost. Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik noted that, "as a shareholder or even a debt-holder, if 
you have cash in the door, and it's being used, you want that cash to be used to the highest return possible, and if 
you're keeping people and capacity which is not earning a return, then that is inefficient".
The White House relaxed minimumservice rules this week, saying it would allow some airlines to drop routes as 
long as they were served by another carrier.
Restrictions on lay-offs may not be eased, but Wall Street is in no doubt about what will happen when they end. 
JPMorgan Chase analyst Jamie Baker, in a recent note, said: "October 1 is likely to emerge as one of the darkest 
days in history for airline labour."
The taxpayer has little chance of recovering their investment, because even a strong rebound for share is likely to 
offset only some of the cost of the grants. Delta Air Lines, for example, secured $5.4bn, of which $3.8bn was a 
forgivable grant, with the rest a 10-year unsecured loan. Warrants were granted to the government for 1 per cent of 
Delta's equity, giving the Treasury the right to buy stock at April's level. Delta stock would need to multiply from $22 
now to about $575, according to FT calculations, for taxpayers to make back their outlay.
A positive outcome for airlines' shareholders is hardly certain, dependent not just on cutting cash burn before and 
after the September 30 expiry of lay-off restrictions but on finding other savings, too. Famed investor Warren Buffett 
has given up on the sector, selling his stakes in the four largest US carriers at a loss. "You've got too many planes," 
he said.
Shareholders are also reliant on airlines finding the cash to see them through whatever the pandemic throws at 
them.
The Bush and Obama administrations spent tens of billions funding the bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler when 
there was no private capital available. The Trump administration's intervention in the airline industry has not so 
much replaced private capital as helped carriers to access it. Delta raised $5bn from investors last month by 
mortgaging assets including airport landing slots, for example, and United sold $1bn of equity.
US carriers eye job cuts when bailout terms expire Airlines. Government aid ; Other nations' operators have 
downsized but Treasury restrictions limit room to ac....
Airlines also have the option of further government funding from a second $25bn bailout pot, which would come not 
as grants but as secured loans. American Airlines, the most heavily indebted carrier and the only one so far to have 
said it will certainly take the second bailout, will emerge with the government holding an interest equal to 12 per 
cent of the company.
The pandemic has turned the government into a financing source of last resort for swaths of corporate America, but 
the socialisation of risk and the picking of winners and losers has concerned some.
"Equity investors get limited liability, and yet they get the upside of profits," noted Anthony Casey, a University of 
Chicago law professor. "Businesses go bad for arbitrary reasons all the time. There is no obvious reason to funnel 
money to equity investors."

 Ryanair (RYAAY) said early Friday it cut more than 250 office staff across Europe as a result of aircraft groundings 
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The low-cost carrier said the workers will not be needed to return to work on June 1 when its offices will reopen due 
to a substantial decline in passenger traffic.
For the full year ending March 2021, Ryanair said it now expects to carry less than 100 million passengers 
compared with a target of over 155 million passengers.
The Irish airline also said it is continuing to meet its pilot and cabin crew unions in Europe to complete up to 3,000 
job cuts and 20% pay cuts, as it plans to return to about 40% of its normal flight schedules from July onward.

May 15, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Azul S.A. AZUL[1] 
reported bland traffic numbers for April, 2020 primarily due to lacklustre air travel demand stemming from the 
COVID-19 outbreak. Both domestic as well as international demand and supply fell on a year-over-year and year-
till-date basis. Moreover, consolidated load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined since consolidated 
traffic plunge was more than the capacity reduction.Consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger kilometers 
or RPKs) fell 90% year over year. Apart from a significant decline of 92.6% in international traffic, the metric also 
plunged 89.3% on the domestic front, thereby buoying the overall figure. Consolidated capacity (measured in 
available seat kilometers/ASKs) dropped 87.7% due to 87.2% and 89.9% fall in domestic and international capacity, 
respectively.Consolidated load factor fell to 68.8% (or 15.6 percentage points). Both domestic load factor declined 
13.9 percentage points to 69.8 and international load factor declined 22.9 percentage points to 64%.AZUL SA Price

May 15, 2020( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  This week's featured 
linkCOVID-19 Outlook for air travel in the next 5 years[1] - IATA This presentation has all kinds of interesting tidbits 
around how IATA came to the conclusion that the industry will go back to normal in 3 to 5 years, lagging the rest of 
the economy. In particular, the comparison between Chinese business confidence and air traffic is concerning. 
https://crankyconcierge.com/collections/airports/products/sydney-syd-t-shirtImage of the Week: Nothing really 
grabbed me this week, so I decided I'd put up a t-shirt reminder. The Airport Collection[2] continues to grow, and 
I've added everything from Anchorage[3] and Nashville[4] to Tampa[5] and, as you can see above, Sydney[6]. More 
are on the way every day. Note that there are several colors available and not just the gray I showed on 
Wednesday.  Two for the roadAnalysis: Mitsubishi suspends development of M100, continues M90 due to 
COVID[7] - Leeham News and Analysis Well, Embraer could use a little good news, and this is it. If Mitsubishi ends 
up shelving the M100, that means Embraer has the only 76-seater flying that regionals can fly for US partners. 
Strategically, this seems like a big miss for Mitsubishi, but on the other hand, this does require big money. And then 
again, who knows what pilot scope clauses will look like down the road.Ryanair to axe Lauda's Airbus leases in 
favour of Boeing[8] - ch-aviation Ryanair was pretty excited about bringing Airbuses into the fleet with its acquisition 
of Lauda, but now the airline appears to have soured on the idea and will scale back plans dramatically. I just 
assume that everything Ryanair does is a negotiation of some sort, so if Airbus wants to come play ball, Ryanair 
won't turn them away. But this sounds like Airbus isn't particularly interested at least not enough to price the 
airplanes where Ryanair wants them. [ 1]:            https://www.iata.org/en/iata-repository/publications/economic-

The impact on air travel from the coronavirus will be felt for many years to come, according to the International Air 
Transport Association, which estimates that passenger traffic won't rebound to pre-crisis levels until at least 2023.
The trade association for the world's airlines said that demand for air travel had dropped more than 90% in Europe 
and the U.S. since the start of the pandemic, and warned that recovery will be even slower if lockdowns and travel 
restrictions are extended.
"We are asking governments to have a phased approach to restart the industry and to fly again," Alexandre de 
Juniac, the IATA's director general and CEO, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Thursday. De Juniac is hopeful 
that some flying will resume by the summer.
"We are aiming at reopening and boosting the domestic market by end of the second quarter, and opening the 
regional or continental markets - such as Europe, North America or Asia-Pacific - by the third quarter, and 
intercontinental in the fall," he said.
"So for summer we hope that you will see flights within Europe coming back, with I hope interesting prices and very 
safe processes of control."
The European Union's external borders remain closed to non-EU nationals until mid-June. The European 
Commission has recommended a phased approach for its member states to reopen borders that would start with 
countries with low levels of coronavirus infections.
Q2 will look 'similarly bleak' for Dubai Airports amid virus outbreak: CEO
The comments from the IATA com as travel groups are desperate to bring operations back to life and some are 
already rolling out plans to do so.
United Airlines has expressed its aims to schedule Europe and China routes in June, Dubai's flagship Emirates 
Airline will recommence nine outbound routes starting May 21 and European low-cost carrier Ryanair expects to 
have 40% of its flights running by July 1. Budget carrier Wizz Air will restart routes from London's Luton Airport 
starting June 16, Lufthansa is planning service expansion in June and IAG will resume some flights in July, among 
others.
Air travel won't return to pre-crisis levels until 2023, IATA chief warns
Mandatory quarantine 'useless'
But any hopes for a boost to the industry with some resumed travel will be dashed if governments institute 
mandatory 14-day quarantine periods for travelers upon arrival, de Juniac warned.
"We are advocating with governments not to implement quarantine measures that will retain people for two weeks 
that will arrive anywhere," he said.
"We think that it is useless provided we have implemented the health and sanitary controls that we are discussing 
with governments. It is absolutely key for the tourist industry which is so important for so many countries in Europe."
Scores of countries including Australia, New Zealand, China, Spain and potentially the U.K. are requiring 
international travelers to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival, with varying degrees of enforcement: in Australia, 
arrivals are escorted to a hotel where they must remain for 14 days, while in other countries they are expected to 
"self-quarantine" at home. Hong Kong issued state-monitored tracking bracelets that arrivals must wear to ensure 
they do not leave their area of quarantine. Such policies will no doubt deter many people from wanting to travel.
De Juniac believes quarantine periods are simply not necessary as long as airlines and airports uphold stringent 
sanitation and monitoring practices.
"Is it possible to have an aircraft full and without risk of contamination? Our answer is yes," de Juniac said, 
"provided we implement control and sanitary processes for passengers just before the flight - by asking for 
temperature control, by the obligation to wear a mask, by cleaning the aircraft properly and disinfecting properly, by 
limiting the distribution of food to prepackaged food, by limiting cabin luggage to one luggage to avoid disembarking 
and embarking process to be too overcrowded."
With such a multilayered approach, he argued, "you limit the risk of contamination. ... And then the quarantine is not 
useful from our point of view in this case."
Looking at the nature of flying - numerous people packed into a tight space, loading and picking up luggage, using 
the airplane toilets - it's hard to imagine that any sort of virus spread or contamination could be entirely avoided.
But the IATA chief was adamant, citing on-board studies carried out "that demonstrate that the risk of contamination 
is absolutely minimal even when you don't have special equipment."
He added that air filters in planes ensure safe ventilation, that sitting behind seat backs rather than face to face with 
other passengers reduces droplet spread and that mandatory masks will further reduce contamination.
"So if you have special equipment, special controls, special cleaning, you reduce the risk to something which will 
never be zero but will be negligible. That is our strong conviction based on studies, on the equipment we are using - 
and on something which is even more important, that is safety, which is the key priority of this industry," he said.
De Juniac stressed that passengers' safety came first, and that resumption of activity was ultimately up to 
government decisions.
"I think the travelers are expecting us to implement a safe process of sanitary and health control for passengers. 
We are working with governments on that," he added.
"It will be possible to fly safely at least in Europe we hope, and then it depends on government decisions to lift travel 
restrictions and border closures."

May 14, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair released five-step safety 
guidelines on how it will operate amid the Coronavirus pandemic, as the airline is preparing to resume 40% of its 
scheduled flights as of July 1. 'Ryanair will work closely with public health authorities to ensure that these flights 
comply, where possible, with effective measures to limit the spread of Covid-19', saidRyanair's CEO Eddie Wilson 
in an announcement issued on May 12. Europe's largest low-cost airline published safety guidelines for five stages; 
before flying, while at the airport, when boarding, on board, and when landing.  According to the announcement, 
Ryanair advises passengers to opt for carrying their cabin bags with them, check their temperature at home, and 
wear a mask at all times. 
At the airport, travellers should use the automated kiosk to check their bag and the fast track if possible, as well as 
to keep social-distance and use hand sanitiser if not wash their hands. While boarding, passengers should not 
queue at gates but have their passport open and ready to scan. The airline's crew will be wearing masks at all 
times, and the aircrafts, that usefiltration systems with hospital standards, will beprofessionally cleaned and 
disinfected on a daily basis. Inflight service will be limited and sales will be cashless. Upon arrival, passengers 
should maintain their mask and keep social-distance. The company's CEO said that as the example of Asia has 
shown, 'temperature checks and face masks/coverings are the most effective way to achieve this on short haul (1 
hour) within Europe's single market.' Ryanair will also require passengers flying in July and August to fill in details of 
how long their planned visit will be, and also their address while visiting another EU country, the company's 
announcement reads. This contact information will be provided to EU Governments to help them monitor any 
isolation regulations they require of visitors on intra-EU flights, the statement adds. Earlier in May, Ryanair 
announced plans to cut up to 3,000 jobs, mostly pilots and cabin crew, and a 20% pay cut to the remaining staff, in 
a bid to survive the Coronavirus crisis.

Ryanair Holdings is looking to cancel the leases on all of the A320-200s operated by its Lauda (OE, Vienna) 
subsidiary and replace them with B737s, chief executive Michael O'Leary has told Reuters. The Irish LCC holding's 
acquisition of the Austrian carrier in 2018 was touted as a diversification of its fleet which, for the greater part of its 
history, has been anchored around the B737. The ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows that, inclusive of 
Malta Air and Buzz, Ryanair currently has 440 B737-800s plus a single B737-700, most of which are owned, with a 
total of 210 B737-8-200 jets on order. However, Lauda has an all-leased fleet of thirty-two A320-200s. In March 
2019, O'Leary was advocating a dual Boeing-Airbus fleet, saying he had opened negotiations with Airbus on 
ordering 100 A321s. As recently as February, Ryanair said it aimed to increase Lauda's fleet to 38 Airbus A320 
Family jets by summer 2020. But he told Reuters on May 12 that "we would not initiate talks with Airbus until such 
time as Airbus wants to initiate talks with us. 
Until they need an order from Ryanair Group, frankly we are wasting our time talking to Airbus." Ryanair now 
intends to "significantly reduce the scale of the Lauda fleet" and will cancel almost all of its deliveries due from 
lessors over the next 12 months.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary called the 14-day quarantine plan on passengers arriving in the UK 
"nonsense" with no scientific basis as the airline pledged to resume 40 per cent of flights from July.
Speaking at the FT's Global Boardroom event yesterday, Mr O'Leary said: "We can't be imposing these entirely 
arbitrary and non-scientific 14-day isolations, which are entirely unenforceable and unpoliceable anyway.
"This is a country that can't even do testing and tracing, never mind following up on people on where they are 
spending their 14-day isolation."
Mr O'Leary said that the UK's plan could not be scientific if both the French and Irish were exempt from the 
measures.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier laid out plans yesterday to resume flights from most of its 80 bases across the 
continent, increasing the number of flights to almost 1,000 a day from 30 since lockdowns were imposed in March.
In recent weeks, carriers have looked tentatively at resuming flights.
Wizz Air restarted some routes from Luton at the start of the month, while IAG, parent of British Airways, has 
signalled plans to resume operations from July.
Ryanair boss brands quarantine 'nonsense' Airlines
However, the industry suffered a setback on Sunday when the UK government announced plans to introduce a 14-
day quarantine for people arriving by air, a move that many airlines think would extinguish hope of a resumption in 
international travel. IAG has warned that it is likely to undermine its plan to resume 50 per cent of its flights in July.
The FT last month revealed Ryanair had planned to resume about 40 per cent of capacity, rising to 80 per cent by 
September. However, Mr O'Leary said it now expected capacity to rise to between 60 and 70 per cent by 
September.
The carrier is preparing to cut up to 15 per cent of its 19,000 workforce. British Airways is reducing up to 30 per cent 
of its 42,000 jobs, while Virgin Atlantic last week announced plans to axe up to a third of its staff.
Ryanair said passengers would be expected to wear face masks or coverings at all times in the terminal and on the 
aircraft.

The battle between lockdown and reopen proponents just moved up a notch. Tesla's Elon Musk and Ryanair's 
Michael O'Leary are chafing at the cash drain of silent factories and grounded planes. They are challenging health 
guidelines and switching the lights back on. Arrest me, taunted Mr Musk.
As bosses of companies worth a combined $800bn - and burning through, respectively, an estimated $200m and 
(EURO)60m-(EURO)100m a week - the duo have much at stake. But they are not alone. Many small enterprises 
are quietly ignoring health advice in its full extent, including two metres of personal space for every worker, to 
reactivate business as normal.
Renegade returnees are taking their stance on a divide exaggerated by political prevarication: reopening the 
economy versus continued lockdown. Both bosses claim that premature openings strike a blow for freedom. 
Shareholders should wince just as hard as employee rights campaigners. The real reasons are financial.
Mr O'Leary plans to fly 1,000 flights a day, 40 per cent of the Irish carrier's capacity, from July 1, subject to airport 
health measures and the lifting of intra-EU flight curbs. Even with high variable costs and a payroll bolstered by 
government, it is looking at a first quarter loss. At 40 per centof capacity in part of the second quarter at lower 
yields, Ryanair will struggle to make a profit over the summer period. This is still a lot better than the wipeout that 
would result from extended closure and a slow reopening.
Similar logic applies to Mr Musk. Lower deliveries and operating losses could leave his electric car group burning 
through $2.4bn this quarter, say GLJ's bearish analysts. That will take a big bite from the $8.8bn cash on the 
balance sheet at the end of the last quarter. The entrepreneur has threatened to decamp to a more laissez-faire

state. Any operational savings gleaned by quitting high-cost California would be more than obliterated by the cost of 
the move.
There is more to running a business than putting planes in the sky and cars on the road. You need social consent 
too. Bosses jeopardise that when they risk the lives of employees and customers. If fatalities ensue, so may an 
outcry, customer disenchantment and state punishment. It helps to be tough in business. But you are never tougher 
than authorities with police and prosecutors at their command.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary called the 14-day quarantine plan on passengers arriving in the UK 
"nonsense" with no scientific basis as the airline pledged to resume 40 per cent of flights from July.
Speaking at the FT's Global Boardroom event yesterday, Mr O'Leary said: "We can't be imposing these entirely 
arbitrary and non-scientific 14-day isolations, which are entirely unenforceable and unpoliceable anyway.
"This is a country that can't even do testing and tracing, never mind following up on people on where they are 
spending their 14-day isolation."
Mr O'Leary said the plan could not be scientific if both the French and Irish were exempt from the measures.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier laid out plans yesterday to resume flights from most of its 80 bases across the 
continent, increasing the number of flights to almost 1,000 a day from 30 since lockdowns were imposed in March.
In recent weeks, carriers have looked tentatively at resuming flights.
Wizz Air restarted some routes from Luton at the start of the month, while IAG, parent of British Airways, has 
signalled plans to resume operations from July.
However, the industry suffered a setback on Sunday when the UK government announced plans to introduce a 14-
day quarantine for people arriving by air, a move that many airlines think would extinguish hope of a resumption in 
international travel.
Ryanair boss brands UK quarantine 'nonsense' Airlines
IAG has warned that it is likely to undermine its plan to resume 50 per cent of its flights in July.
The FT last month first revealed that Ryanair had planned to resume about 40 per cent of capacity , rising to 80 per 
cent by September. However, Mr O'Leary said it now expected capacity to increase to between 60 and 70 per cent 
by September.
The carrier is preparing to cut up to 15 per cent of its 19,000 workforce. British Airways is reducing up to 30 per cent 
of its 42,000 jobs, while Virgin Atlantic last week announced plans to axe up to a third of its staff.
Ryanair said passengers would be expected to wear face masks or coverings at all times in the terminal and on the 
aircraft, and should check in online and with fewer bags.
Queueing for toilets would be prohibited on board, but use of toilets would be accessible to individuals on request. 
Cabin crew would wear face masks or coverings.
Ryanair said it would require all passengers flying in July and August to fill in details at check-in of how long their 
planned visit would be and their holiday address. The information would be given to EU governments to help them 
monitor any isolation requirements they might impose.
Mr O'Leary told the FT Global Boardroom event that the airline was planning to make more legal complaints to 
countries over state aid concerns, having already filed two against Swedish and French bailouts. See Lex

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) Chief Executive Michael O'Leary called the UK government's plan to require a 14-day 
quarantine for passengers arriving in the UK "nonsense," London's Financial Times reported Tuesday.
The outspoken CEO said the "unenforceable and unpoliceable" COVID-19 measure could not be scientific if people 
from France and Ireland are exempted from the policy, according to the publication.
"This is a country that can't even do testing and tracing, never mind following up on people on where they are 
spending their 14-day isolation," O'Leary said at the FT's Global Boardroom event Tuesday.

https://www.fft.ie/compulsory-face-masks-as-ryanair-works-to-restore-
services/31809#respond Ryanair has announced plans to return to 40% of normal flight schedules from 
Wednesday 1st July 2020, subject to Government restrictions on intra-EU flights being lifted, and effective public 
health measures being put in place at airports. Ryanair will operate a daily flight schedule of almost 1,000 flights, 
restoring 90% of its pre-COVID 19 route network. Full details of these routes, frequencies, flight times, and 
promotional prices are available on            www.Ryanair.com. Since the COVID 19 flight restrictions in mid-March, 
Ryanair has been operating a skeleton daily schedule of 30 flights between Ireland, the UK and Europe. 
From July, Ryanair will restart flying from most of its 80 bases across Europe. There will be fewer daily/weekly 
frequencies on trunk routes, as Ryanair works to restore some services on the widest number of routes, rather than 
operating high frequency services on a small number. Ryanair also released a return to flying video, encouraging 
passengers to observe effective health measures. These include fewer checked bags, check in online, downloading 
boarding pass to passenger smart phones, as well as undergoing temperature checks at airport entry and wearing 
face masks/coverings at all times in the terminal and on board aircraft. On board its aircraft, Ryanair cabin crew will 
wear face masks/coverings and a limited inflight service will be offered of pre-packaged snacks and drinks, with no 
cash sales. Queuing for toilets will also be prohibited on board although toilet access will be made available to 
individual passengers upon request. Ryanair will require all passengers flying in July and August to fill in details at 
the point of check in of how long their planned visit will be, and also their address while visiting another EU country. 
This contact information will be provided to EU Governments to help them to monitor any isolation regulations they 
require of visitors on intra-EU flights. Speaking to Sky News, CEO Michael O'Leary said: 'We think those flights will

be between 50-60% booked, lower than our normal load'. He called the British government's two-week isolation for 
those flying into the UK as 'ineffective', 'unenforceable and unpolicable', saying that it had 'no science base to it at 
all'.

The outbreak of the coronavirus has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed. Following are 
developments Tuesday related to national and global response, the work place and the spread of the virus.
________________________
TRAVEL & LODGING: Hotels, rental cars, cruises, flights, anything associated with getting away from it all, is on 
hold. Quarterly numbers from airlines and the rest of the travel industry this week and last were abysmal. Job cuts 
have begun.
- Hyatt will begin laying off about 1,300 people next month. The hotel chain has slashed costs through pay cuts for 
executives as well as work and pay reductions for workers, but it has not been enough to staunch the bleeding.
- Brussels Airlines will let 25% of its workers go as part of a massive cost-cutting plan. The Lufthansa subsidiary in 
Belgium, which employs 4,000 people, has suspended its flights and plans to reduce its fleet from 54 to 38 aircraft 
as part of its restructuring.
- Ryanair will begin operating nearly 1,000 daily flights starting in July - assuming government restrictions on flights 
within Europe are lifted. The budget airline will restore 90% of its pre-COVID-19 route network. The airline has been 
operating with a skeleton schedule since mid-March, with some 30 flights daily between Ireland, the UK and 
Europe.
- The Transportation Department is allowing airlines to drop flights to some destinations without jeopardizing billions 
in federal pandemic aid. The department issued a notice Tuesday that airlines will be able to drop up to 5% of their 
destinations as long as at least one airline serves every U.S. airport that had airline service before March 1.
- Airline complaints have jumped from the average 1,500 per month, to more than 25,000 in March and April, 
according to the Transportation Department. Most of the complaints were about refunds. The department issued 
new refund guidelines for airlines but stopped short of demands by congressional Democrats to require cash 
refunds instead of ticket vouchers when customers cancel a reservation. Airlines are issuing refunds if the carrier 
canceled the flight.
Pants, bras are out, PJs in; travel industry layoffs begin
GOVERNMENTS & CENTRAL BANKS: The U.S. is trying to determine how best to reopen the economy while 
limiting risk. There have been red flags from nation's that have already attempted to do so.
- People in Singapore will be able to get professional haircuts or pop into the bakery Tuesday as the government 
loosens restrictions, three weeks before a partial lockdown ends. Barbers and hairdressers, food manufacturers 
and outlets as well as laundry shops are among select businesses that can open their doors under strict rules.
- Britain's Treasury chief extended a job retention plan to the end of October, but said that from August the 
government might pay less than the current 80% of workers' salaries as it grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons on Tuesday that he wouldn't give up on people who relied on the program

furloughed - jobs that would have been lost if not for the program.
WHOPPERS, DRUMSTICKS & DOUGHNUTS: The risk to a restaurant's survival in many places depends on how 
heavily it depends on a dining room. Fast-food chains, while damaged, have transitioned to takeout, delivery and 
drive-thru.
- The company that owns Burger King, Popeyes and Tim Hortons has reopened nearly 1,000 dining rooms in North 
America with new restrictions, and efforts to reopen fully are ongoing.
Restaurant Brands International CEO Jose Cil said in a letter Tuesday that the company is offering contactless 
service at most restaurants. Tables are spaced in dining rooms and will be, along with chairs, sanitized after every

Ryanair gets ready to fly more often in July

LONDON (AP) - Budget airline Ryanair says it will begin operating nearly 1,000 daily flights starting in July, 
assuming government restrictions on flights within Europe are lifted after the shutdown due to the COVID-19 
outbreak.
The carrier, which was Europe's busiest airline before the pandemic, said Tuesday it will restore 90% of its pre-
COVID-19 route network, though with less frequency. The airline has been operating with a skeleton schedule since 
mid-March, with some 30 flights daily between Ireland, the U.K. and Europe.
"After four months, it is time to get Europe flying again so we can reunite friends and families, allow people to return 
to work and restart Europe's tourism industry, which provides so many millions of jobs," Ryanair Chief Executive 
Eddie Wilson said.
The strategy is not without risk. Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned Tuesday that people were unlikely to be 
able to go on foreign holidays this summer.
Asked whether "summer was cancelled," Mr Hancock told ITV: "I think that's likely to be the case."
"It is unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to be possible for this summer,'' he said. "I just think 
that's a reality of life."
Aviation has been among the hardest hit industries in the pandemic, with aircraft around the world grounded by 
travel restrictions. Many have cut costs and staff to respond.
The latest example is Belgium's Brussels Airlines, which on Tuesday unveiled a cost-cutting plan that will result in 
the reduction of 25% of its workforce.
The Lufthansa subsidiary, which employs 4,000 people, has suspended its flights as a result of the pandemic. The 
carrier, which also suffered amid the bankruptcy of travel operator Thomas Cook last year, plans to reduce its fleet 
from 54 to 38 aircraft.
Ryanair gets ready to fly more often in July
Brussels Airlines says it is losing 1 million euros ($1.1 million) a day because of revenue losses, aircraft leasing and 
maintenance costs. The company has asked the government for 290 million euros in aid.
Ryanair, warned, meanwhile, that flying would not be the same as it once was.
On the plane, lining up for toilets will be forbidden, though access to bathrooms can be made on request. Crew 
members will wear masks and offer limited services. Cash will no longer be accepted. It did not specify if some 
seats would be left empty.
The airline also announced that passengers flying in July and August will be required at check-in to state the length 
of their planned visit and give an address for their destination. The information will be given to governments in the 
event they want to monitor the passenger for isolation requirements.
William Ryder, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said Ryanair's announcement seems "optimistic,'' though 
"fortune favors the well prepared.''
"Ryanair won't be caught napping if flights are resumed this summer,'' he said in a statement. "While preparing to 
get planes back in the air will cost money, which will be wasted if restrictions aren't lifted, management clearly feels 
this is a risk worth running."

Ryanair on Tuesday confirmed it will return to 40% of its planned flight schedule from July 1 and will require 
passengers to wear face coverings and to ask crew permission to use the toilet.
The Irish airline, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, is to begin to fly 1,000 flights per day on July 1, up from a 
skeleton service of 30 flights per day it is currently operating, it said in a statement.
That will allow it to cover 90% of its pre-crisis network but fewer frequencies, it said.
This month CEO Michael O'Leary said Ryanair was likely to go from 40% of normal flights in July to 50% in August, 
but with at least half of the seats likely to be empty due to "anemic demand."
As part of its COVID-19 response, Ryanair will require all passengers to fill out a form detailing the length of their 
planned visit and where they will stay, information that will be provided to EU governments to monitor quarantine 
measures.
Britain, one of Ryanair's three largest markets, plans to quarantine for 14 days after arriving in the country, a move 
that industry leaders on Monday said would worsen an already grave situation for the aviation sector.
Ryanair said it will disinfect all aircraft interiors every night and ban cash sales on board and encourage customers 
to check their temperature before traveling.
"Queuing for toilets will also be prohibited on board although toilet access will be made available to individual 
passengers upon request," the statement said.

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary on Tuesday said Britain's plan to have arriving passengers self-isolate in their

"It's unimplementable and unenforceable anyway, so I think people will largely ignore it, which is not good," O'Leary 
told BBC television, predicting that the measures would "disappear pretty quickly".
He said, however, that the 14-day quarantine would not necessarily discourage British holidaymakers travelling to 
southern Europe, as they could quarantine for two weeks at home upon their return before schools reopen at the 
end of the summer. (Reuters)

Low-cost airline Ryanair on Tuesday said it plans to restore 40 per cent of its regular flights from July 1, subject to 
the lifting of Covid-19-related restrictions on flights within the European Union.
Ryanair said it also requires "effective public health measures" to be implemented at airports before it begins a daily 
schedule of about 1,000 flights, restoring 90-percent of its routes.
The airline said it is currently operating only 30 flights on a "skeleton daily schedule," after governments across 
Europe imposed social distancing measures and severe restrictions on international travel.
Ryanair said it plans to resume operations at most of its 80 bases in Europe but will operate fewer flights on its 
major routes.
It said it will change ticketing, check-in and baggage services to improve social distancing and reduce the risk of 
spreading the novel coronavirus.
The airline said it wants passengers to undergo temperature checks at airport entrances and wear face masks at all 
times, including during the flights.
"After four months [of lockdown], it is time to get Europe flying again so we can reunite friends and families, allow 
people to return to work, and restart Europe's tourism industry, which provides so many millions of jobs," said Eddie 
Wilson, Ryanair's chief executive.
Ryanair group head Michael O'Leary told the BBC that a 14-day quarantine requirement for arrivals to Britain, 
where the airline does much of its business, was "unimplementable and unenforceable."

Temperature checks, masks and quarantine will not deter people from a holiday in the sun after three months 
"locked up" at home, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday as he announced plans for 1,000 
flights a day from July.
The Irish low-cost carrier is to make face coverings and temperature checks mandatory for all staff and passengers 
while the airline, Europe's largest, will scrap cash payments on board and make customers seek permission to use 
the toilets.
Ryanair is the latest airline to announce measures aimed at reassuring customers they can safely return to planes 
despite the coronavirus pandemic and to try to get cash flowing again, with compulsory masks by far the most 
common proposal so far.
"People have been locked up since the middle of March. People are really gagging to get out and I think get abroad 
for the sunshine," O'Leary told Reuters in a telephone interview.
"We will see a surge of bookings building over the next six weeks up to July 1," O'Leary said, although this had not 
begun.
O'Leary said he was urging European authorities to make both masks and temperature checks mandatory across 
the continent, adding the idea of leaving the middle seats on single aisle aircraft empty to allow for social distancing 
was now "dead."
The European regulator, European Union Aviation Safety Agency, is to propose new safety measures for aviation 
later this week.
Ryanair expects Europe travel surge despite masks and quarantine
Rivals Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and Wizz have all made masks mandatory and the CEO of British Airways owner 
IAG Willie Walsh has said he is open to the idea.
Most airlines are disinfecting planes and several have limited cabin service on board.
Their focus in recent days, however, has been in resisting quarantine periods being imposed across the continent.
O'Leary joined criticism of Britain's plan to make arriving passengers quarantine for 14 days, saying the fact that 
France and Ireland had been exempted proved it was unscientific.
"This isn't science," he said, adding the measure was "unenforceable and unpoliceable" and would be ignored.
However, Ryanair said it will require all passengers to fill out a form detailing the length of their planned visit and 
where they will stay, information that will be provided to EU governments to monitor any quarantine measures.
O'Leary said he was optimistic there would be no quarantine periods for people traveling between countries in 
Europe's Schengen free travel zone and he hoped that travel restrictions to and from Britain and Europe would be 
dropped.
"Once the industry begins to recover towards September-October, I think we will be back to essentially open skies," 
he said, adding British families could happily quarantine at home for two weeks after returning from their holidays.
Earlier on Tuesday, Britain's health minister said Britons were unlikely to be able to have an international holiday 
this summer because of the pandemic.
Once aboard their flight, O'Leary said people would not be allowed to queue for the toilet on Ryanair planes and 
would have wait for permission to get up from cabin crew.
Ryanair is to operate around 40% of its original flights schedule from July up from a skeleton service of around 30 
flights a day in May and June, he said. Ryanair should return to its normal passenger number levels by 2021, with 
ticket price levels returning to normal by 2022.
O'Leary also indicated Ryanair plans to move back towards an all-Boeing fleet by canceling leases for Airbus 
A320s for its Lauda subsidiary and likely replacing 30 Airbus jets at the Austrian airline with Boeing 737s. (Reuters)

Airline lays out new coronavirus rules as it aims to restart 40% of services in July
Passengers travelling with Ryanair will have to ask permission to use the toilet under new rules laid out by the 
airline, as it prepares to restart 40% of flights in July in the hope that government restrictions on travel in Europe will 
be lifted.
Europe's biggest budget carrier intends to run almost 1,000 flights a day from 1 July and to restore 90% of its pre-
pandemic route network. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, Ryanair was operating 2,400 flights a day. It will restart 
flying from most of its 80 bases across the continent.
Ryanair published a return to flying video that advises passengers to check their temperature before going to the 
airport, check in online and download their boarding pass to their smartphone. Travellers will undergo further 
temperature tests at the airport, must wear face masks or other coverings and wash their hands and use hand 
sanitiser in terminals.
On board the aircraft, they will be able to buy pre-packaged snacks and drinks, using cashless payments only. 
Queuing for toilets will be prohibited on board, although individual passengers will be able to use the facilities "upon 
request". Physical distancing at airports and onboard will be encouraged where possible.
The measures include fewer checked bags and a deep clean of the aircraft every night with chemicals that are 
effective for more than 24 hours. All Ryanair planes are fitted with Hepa air filters similar to those used in critical 
hospital wards, the airline says.
Since the Covid-19 flight restrictions were imposed in mid-March, Ryanair has been operating a skeleton daily 
schedule of 30 flights between Ireland, the UK and Europe. The pandemic has forced airlines around the world to 
ground their fleets.
As a temporary public health measure, while EU countries emerge from their Covid-19 lockdowns, Ryanair will 
require all passengers flying in July and August to fill in details at the point of check-in of how long their planned 
visit will be, and their address while visiting another EU country. This contact information will be provided to EU 
governments to help them to monitor any isolation regulations.
Ryanair passengers will have to ask to use toilet when flights resume
The Ryanair chief executive, Eddie Wilson, said: "It is important for our customers and our people that we return to 
some normal schedules from 1 July onwards. Governments around Europe have implemented a four-month 
lockdown to limit the spread of the Covid 19 virus. After four months, it is time to get Europe flying again so we can 
reunite friends and families, allow people to
return to work, and restart Europe's tourism industry, which provides so many millions of jobs."
Other airlines including Wizz Air and KLM have also announced a return to flying. The British Airways owner, IAG, 
had been planning to run 1,000 flights a day from July, but its chief executive, Willie Walsh, said on Monday it would 
review its plans in light of the UK government's plan to quarantine people arriving by air. He said the number of 
flights would probably be "pretty minimal".
Michael O'Leary, the group chief executive of Ryanair, brushed off the 14-day quarantine, from which French and 
Irish travellers will be exempt. He said the exemption showed the quarantine period was not based on science, 
passengers would ignore it, and the UK government lacked the police resources to check on people.
He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: "I don't think this 14-day isolation will be effective. It will have no credibility 
among the travelling public, but it is manageable."

Ryanair plans to move back towards an all-Boeing fleet by cancelling leases for Airbus A320s for its Lauda 
subsidiary and likely replacing 30 Airbus jets at the Austrian airline with Boeing 737s, Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary told Reuters.
Ryanair's purchase in 2018 of Airbus operator Lauda was pitched as a way to diversify the fleet of the budget airline 
group, which had until then exclusively flown Boeing jets and currently has over 450 737s.
O'Leary, whose expansion plans have been curtailed by the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX, said in March last 
year he was in early talks with Airbus about an order for 100 A321s and that Ryanair wanted to have a dual Boeing-
Airbus fleet.
But on Tuesday, O'Leary said he currently viewed talking with Airbus as a waste of his time.
"We would not initiate talks with Airbus until such time as Airbus wants to initiate talks with us," he said in an 
interview.
"Until they need an order from the Ryanair Group, frankly we are wasting our time talking to Airbus," he added, 
without elaborating.
Instead, Ryanair planned to "significantly reduce the scale of the Lauda fleet," said O'Leary, who is known for his 
brinkmanship in negotiations.
"We have (Airbus) aircraft that are due to be delivered over the next 12 months and we will cancel almost all of 
those deliveries," which are from leasing companies, he said.
Assuming talks with Boeing about compensation for delays in the delivery of 210 737 MAX jets - and on a possible 
new aircraft order - go to plan, then Ryanair will probably replace Lauda's 30 Airbus jets with Boeing, he added.
"As long as we can reach an acceptable outcome with Boeing, the Boeing orders we have in place would readily 
replace - I think Lauda will have a fleet of about 30 Airbus aircraft - we would probably replace those Airbus with 
Boeing over the next couple of years."
Ryanair cools on Airbus , moves back towards all- Boeing fleet
In February, Ryanair said it was planning to increase Lauda's fleet from 23 to 38 Airbus A320s by the summer of 
2020.
Ryanair is also in talks with unions at Lauda about pay cuts and a new labour agreement.
O'Leary said the Austrian union was refusing to engage and if this did not change by the end of May, Lauda's home 
base in Vienna would close, with Ryanair Boeing jets replacing the Lauda Airbus planes.
O'Leary said the talks with Boeing on compensation and a possible new order had accelerated, but would likely not 
be concluded by a deadline of May 18-19 and may not conclude until the MAX returns to service, which he said was 
likely to happen in August or September.
O'Leary said the MAX grounding could delay Ryanair's plan to fly 200 million passengers by 2020 "by a year or 
two."

       Shares of Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) were gaining around 3 percent in the morning trading in 
London after the low fares airline announced Tuesday plans to return to 40 percent of normal flight schedules from 
July 1.
 The decision will be subject to Government restrictions on intra-EU flights being lifted, and effective public health 
measures being put in place at airports.
 Ryanair will operate a daily flight schedule of almost 1,000 flights, restoring 90% of its pre-Covid-19 route network. 
The company, since the Covid-19 flight restrictions in mid-March, has been operating a skeleton daily schedule of 
30 flights between Ireland, the UK and Europe.
 From July, Ryanair will restart flying from most of its 80 bases across Europe. There will be fewer daily/weekly 
frequencies on trunk routes, the company noted.
 Further, Ryanair cabin crew will wear face masks/coverings and a limited inflight service will be offered of pre-
packaged snacks and drinks, but no cash sales. All onboard transactions will be cashless.
 Ryanair's CEO Eddie Wilson said, "Governments around Europe have implemented a 4 month lockdown to limit 
the spread of the Covid-19 virus. After 4 months, it is time to get Europe flying again...  Ryanair will work closely 
with public health authorities to ensure that these flights comply, where possible, with effective measures to limit the 
spread of Covid-19."
 In London, Ryanair shares are trading at 9.17 euros, up 3.42 percent.
