Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based no-frills airline, has confirmed a second grant on its share option scheme 
for all its permanent staff.
 Share options will average 20 pct of an employees' pay at a strike price of 4.41 eur.
    No employee will receive less than 4,200 eur in the allocation, the second since since the airline floated in 1997.
    "This new scheme reflects the current low share price and allows our people to share in future increases of the 
share price," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.

Tallinn airport is holding talks with budget airline EasyJet PLC over launching flights, but there is no agreement yet 
on airport fees, airport marketing director Eduard Tuur was quoted as saying by the BNS newswire.
    According to the report, EasyJet is still demanding lower fees than the airport is currently prepared to offer.
 "If we were to meet them halfway, we'd have to lower airport fees for all carriers," Tuur was quoted as saying in 
Estonian daily Postimees.
    "One option to do it would be to lower fees outside rush hours," he said.
    According to the report, EasyJet is also discussing launching flights to Riga in Latvia, a new destination 
announced this week by its competitor Ryanair Holdings PLC.
    Ahti Kuningas, head of the Estonian economy ministry's economic development department, defended Tallinn's 
landing fees by noting its quality of service.
    "Estonia has so far made efforts to ensure that the airport is safe for clients, clean and meeting all requirements, 
hence the price policy of our airport," Kuningas said.

German budget airline Air Berlin will decide whether to
buy 70 new aircraft from Boeing Co or Airbus Industrie within the next two months, CEO Joachim Hunold told 
Handelsblatt newspaper.
    He said rival airlines Ryanair and Easyjet had negotiated good discounts on
aircraft purchases recently, and Air Berlin wants "the same conditions as our
competitors".
    Air Berlin is still considering whether to launch an IPO to raise fresh
capital, Hunold said, adding he expects the airline to post a "decent profit"
this year.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has filed a court case against airport operator BAA PLC alleging monopoly abuse of 
fuel levies.
    Ryanair said BAA introduced a fuel levy charge to recoup the cost of building a fuel hydrant system at Stansted 
Airport in 1991.
 "Since then, BAA has given repeated undertakings in writing that this levy will be eliminated when the capital costs 
were recovered," Ryanair said, adding that BAA has broken these agreements.
    It said that "to date BAA Stansted has, in a 14 year period, recovered over 34 mln stg in fuel levies, three times 
the original cost."
    The no-frills airline added: "If there was competition between the three BAA owned London airports, this fuel levy 
scam would not exist."

(Updates with TBI reaction, easyjet background)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC said it plans a major expansion of its London Luton base with an investment of 240 mln 
usd in 4 new Boeing 737-800 series aircraft and 9 new European routes from London.
    The new routes will be to Barcelona (Girona and Reus), Esjberg, Rome, Murcia, Stockholm, Dinard, Nimes and 
Venice.
 TBI plc, the regional airports operator, said it welcomes the expansionary moves by Ryanair, and also easyJet, of 
London Luton's ongoing and future potential.
    However, it said that while expansion of this scale will have a positive impact on building passenger revenue, the 
extra capacity will not be introduced until 2005 and therefore will have no material impact on figures for the current 
financial year.
    easyJet yesterday said it plans to add three more aircraft to its Luton base, as well as adding more routes.

(Updates with Ryanair comments)
     BAA PLC, the British airport operator, is suing Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC over 1 mln stg of 
"unpaid" landing charges at Stansted airport.
    The Irish airline responded by saying it will contest the case and issue its own proceedings against BAA, for 
"over-charging on fuel levies at Stansted over a 12-year period".
 "As BAA is already aware, our agreement on charges is very specific and expires in 2007," Ryanair said in a 
statement.
    Earlier a spokeswoman for BAA told AFX News a writ will be issued in the British high court on Thursday 
morning.
    "It's a matter we've been trying to settle amicably for a number of weeks and we gave Ryanair a deadline of 
today to pay the unpaid bills. That has passed," she said.
    BAA has also written to Ryanair to inform the airline it regards it as having "repudiated their contract with 
Stansted airport".
    The spokeswoman said this means that although Ryanair can continue to operate from Stansted as normal it will 
no longer enjoy any of its current discounts on aeronautical fees.
    She noted that BAA's current yield across all the airlines it serves at Stansted is about 2.80 stg per passenger, 
while the regulatory cap of charges is 4.89 stg.
    "So when we say that Ryanair will no longer enjoy current discounts that gives a picture of what we are doing."
    Ryanair has about 12.5 mln passengers a year travelling through Stansted.

Budget carrier Tiger Airways said it plans to lease 10-12 aircraft by 2006 after launching operations in the second 
half of this year.
    "In three years, we hope to expand up to 12 aircraft," Tiger Airways' chief executive officer Patrick Gan said.
    "We think we can be profitable within the first year," he added.
    Tiger Airways, which received its first Airbus A320 today, said it will lease another three A320s this year -- one in 
August and two in December -- and four each in 2005 and 2006.
    Gan said the airline will cover destinations within a four-hour flying radius of Singapore but declined to name 
specific countries.
    "Some of the destinations invariably will be the same (as other budget airlines)," Gan said.
    Singapore's other budget airline, Valuair, operates flights to Bangkok, Jakarta and Hong Kong, while Malaysia's 
low-cost carrier AirAsia has routes to Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore and Macau.
     Gan added that Tiger Airways, which is on track to receive an air operator's certificate from the Civil Aviation 
Authority of Singapore to start flights out of Singapore, is looking at flying to 5-10 destinations by the end of the 
year.
    "Fares are the driving force… We are ahead of our competitors in this aspect," Gan said.
    Gan declined to comment on Tiger Airways' fares but said it will be about 40 pct lower than those charged by the 
full-fledged airlines.
    It said that 80 pct of its tickets will be sold via the internet, while the remainder will be sold through travel 
agencies and call centers.
 The company will be based at Singapore's Changi Airport, which will build Asia's first dedicated low-cost airline 
terminal to help maintain Singapore's position as a leading regional aviation hub.
    The single-story terminal is expected to have an initial handling capacity of 2.7 mln passengers a year.
    As the low-cost airline terminal will only be ready in 2006, Tiger Airways will initially be using the facilities at 
Changi Airport's Terminal One.
Singapore's Tiger Airways plans to lease 10-12 aircraft by 2006
    The airline is 49 pct owned by Singapore Airlines, while the Singapore government's investment arm, Temasek 
Holdings, owns 11 pct.
    Tony Ryan, the founder of European low-cost airline Ryanair and US private investors Indigo Partners are the 
other partners in the venture.

Ryanair Holdings PLC CEO Michael O'Leary said he believes that in 10 years' time at the latest, the Irish budget 
airline will be able to give away its flight tickets and generate all its revenue from other sources.
    "We'll get our money from the hotels that we're bringing guests to, the rental car companies, the airport shops 
and the airports, who are happy that we use them," O'Leary told Die Zeit newspaper in an interview to be published 
tomorrow.
 He added that Ryanair will sink its prices as its competitors lift theirs, "because they're all losing money."
    O'Leary predicted that German budget airlines like Air Berlin, dba and TUI AG's HLX will disappear from the 
market.
    "They will continue to lose money, and at some stage they'll be gone," he said, adding he sees only four big 
airlines in Europe in five years' time -- Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Groupe Air France, British Airways PLC and 
Ryanair.

Singapore Changi airport to build Asia's 1st dedicated budget airline terminal

The Changi airport will build Asia's first dedicated low-cost airline terminal to help maintain Singapore's position as 
a leading regional aviation hub, airport authorities said.
    The single-storey terminal is expected to be ready by early 2006 and have an initial handling capacity of 2.7 mln 
passengers a year, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said.
    Operating costs at the terminal will be lower than at Changi's major terminals. To keep costs down, there will be 
no travelators, escalators or aerobridges.
    CAAS deputy director of airport management Foo Sek Min said the decision to build the terminal was made after 
Tiger Airways, a local budget airline due to start flying late this year, committed last week to use it.
    "We are proceeding with this low-cost terminal because there is a customer," Foo told a press conference.
    Transport Minister Yeo Cheow said in March that the government will build a low-cost terminal for budget carriers 
if there is a commitment from at least one airline to use the facilities.
    Foo said the decision to build the terminal, which CAAS described as the first in Asia dedicated solely to low-cost 
carriers, is part of a strategy to ensure that Singapore becomes a key player in the region's fast-growing regional 
budget airline industry.
    "Currently we have 70 airlines offering more than 3,000 over weekly flights and we want to facilitate the 
operations of all airlines in Singapore, including low-cost carriers," Foo said.
    "It is part of the efforts to grow Singapore's status as an aviation hub."
 Tiger Airways is 49 pct owned by Singapore Airlines (SIA). The Singapore government's investment firm, Temasek 
Holdings, which is SIA's majority shareholder, owns another 11 pct.
    Tony Ryan, the founder of successful European low-cost carrier Ryanair and US private investors Indigo 
Partners are other partners in the Tiger venture.

Germany's Frankfurt Hahn Airport, which is 73 pct owned by Fraport AG, said it narrowed its operating loss to 3 mln 
eur in the first six months of this year from a loss of 5.4 mln in the same period a year earlier.
    CEO Andreas Helfer reiterated that the company expects to turn profitable on a operating basis in 2006, and to 
achieve bottom-line profitability in 2008.
 Hahn, whose biggest client is Irish no-frills airline Ryanair, aims to build on its profile as a budget airline hub.
    The airport said it catered to around 1.3 mln passengers in the first six months of this year, up 21 pct on the 
same period a year earlier.
    For the full year Hahn said it expects to record around 3 mln passengers.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair Holdings PLC, is planning to form a consortium that will launch a bid for 
Irish state airline Aer Lingus, the Independent on Sunday newspaper reported citing sources.
    This would not be an offer by Ryanair itself, but would see the two carriers run separately by the same boss, the 
sources said.
 O'Leary's plan, should it proceed, would clash head on with that of Willie Walsh, the chief executive of Aer Lingus, 
who has already approached the Irish government with a proposal to buy the flag carrier.
    He is backed by two other senior executives and an unnamed private equity firm, widely believed to be 3i, the 
Independent said.
    Walsh and his team is believed to be willing to pay more than 500 mln eur for the airline, it said.
    No one at Ryanair is available to comment.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair Holdings PLC, is aiming within a couple of years to ban passengers 
from checking in hold baggage in the next stage of his campaign to drive down costs at Europe's largest no frills 
airline, according to the Financial Times.
    He is also pressing ahead with plans to introduce paid-for, seat-back in-flight entertainment for next year's 
summer season ranging from cartoons to sitcoms, sport and films, though not live television, in order to develop a 
new stream of revenues, the article added.
 The moves came as O'Leary yesterday announced the airline's biggest discounted seat promotion with 1 mln seats 
at 99 pence, excluding taxes and charges, for the coming winter season.
    O'Leary admitted on Thursday that the easy moves to take out costs ranging from internet booking to operating 
to secondary and regional airports had already been exploited. "Now we must be cleverer," he is reported as 
saying.
    The need to reduce costs further to support a further lowering of average fares has been highlighted in recent 
months by the intensifying fare war, that is being waged on European short-haul routes.

UK MPs see 'significant risk' of more no-frills airline collapses

There is a "significant risk" that at least one more no-frills airline could collapse in the near future, leaving UK 
passengers stranded and unprotected by their travel insurance, a parliamentary committee warned.
    The all-party Transport select committee said there were too many loopholes in existing passenger protection 
plans which most passengers were "blissfuly" unaware of.
    The Birmingham-based cheap carrier Duo collapsed in May with debts of 14 mln stg and around 1,000 stranded 
travellers had to pay for alternative tickets home.
    Ryanair PLC chief executive Michael O'Leary warned last month that many players in the no-frills airline sector 
would go bust, a view shared by the MPs.
    "We are persuaded that there is a significant risk of at least one further airline failure which will affect UK 
passengers in the forseeable future," the committee said.
    "We also believe that, as things currently stand, it is likely that a significant proportion of the passengers affected 
would not be protected."
    The committee called on the government to close loopholes in the current protection scheme and levy an extra 
50p - 2 stg per ticket to cover all passengers against airline failure.
    Most travel insurance policies or credit card protection schemes do not cover airline failure.
    Ticket purchases of less than 100 stg are not covered by credit card insurance policies, which would affect the 
thousands of holidaymakers who book cheap flights on the internet.
    "The substantial increase in low cost and general air traffic has resulted in increased exposure of passengers to 
the risk, inconvenience and expenditure of airline failure in a way we consider unacceptable," the committee said.
 The committee said the existing Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) scheme covered some passengers "but 
nowhere near all".
    Passengers who book package holidays are covered by ATOL but not those who book direct - a situation the 
committee described as "absurd".
    "As a passenger, you need to know all the ins and outs of ATOL to work out whether you are covered by it or 
not," said committee chairman Gwyneth Dunwoody.

Airports operator TBI PLC said its four European airports handled a total of 3.83 mln passengers, a 5.8 pct increase 
over the previous year's 3.62 mln passengers, during the first quarter of the year.
    From April 1 to end June 2004, growth at London Luton, Belfast International, Cardiff International and 
Stockholm-Skavsta was driven by the low cost sector which saw traffic increase 7.7 pct to 2.8 mln passengers.
 The full service segment saw an increase of 4.2 pct to 230,800 passengers boosted by an 11.2 pct increase at 
Cardiff.
    Charter was stable at 793,384 passengers, TBI said.
    Stockholm Skavsta airport gain saw the greatest growth of 21.35 pct as it continues to benefit from the expansion 
of Ryanair's operations and the addition of new services by Basiq Air in February 2004.

Body
(Updates with quotes, background)
     A consultation has started on how to guarantee a minimum level of regional air services within the UK as airports 
become more congested, said the Department of Transport (DoT).
    The government last year said in its Future of Air Transport White Paper it would consider imposing Public 
Service Obligations (PSOs) in certain limited circumstances.
    This would guarantee a minimum level of air services on existing routes from UK regional airports to London and 
would allow landing and take off slots at congested London airports to be ring-fenced for those services.
    There are currently 17 routes from UK regions to London airports and the government said it had no evidence 
any were about to be withdrawn.
    "However the pressure on slots is likely to increase in future years and it is possible that more regional services 
out of London might be threatened," the DoT said.
    The airports affected are BAA PLC's Heathrow, Stansted and Gawtick, TBI PLC's Luton and London City, owned 
by Irish businessman Dermot Desmond.
    A PSO cannot be imposed on a route where there is an adequate service operating but if one is introduced, 
regional slots at congested airports can then be "ring fenced" if they meet EU rules.
    Airlines operating regional services to London airports will be asked to give the government at least four month's 
notice of a decision to withdraw services so that potential options to protect a route can be discussed with all 
interested parties.
 Aviation Minister Tony McNulty said the consultation would help the government clarify circumstances where it 
could intervene, "so as to provide a firmer basis for the discussion of individual cases with both airlines and regional 
interests".
    The consultation closes on Oct 8.

European bourses were slightly firmer in lacklustre midday deals as investors remained on the sidelines due to the 
public holiday in the US, dealers said.
    By 11.50 am, the STOXX 50 was up 8.78 points to 2669.67 and the wider STOXX 600 was up 0.5 points at 
238.94.
    With no significant earnings news on today's calendar, broker advice was the main focus for investors this 
morning.
    Deutsche Telekom was nearly 1 pct ahead this morning after CSFB upgraded the fixed-line operator to 
'outperform' from 'neutral'. The broker cited continued growth in the group's T-Mobile USA unit, and the relative 
stability in its European mobile and wireline businesses.
    It was a similar story with BAE Systems, with the UK defence group up 1.7 pct after Citigroup Smith Barney 
upped its rating to 'buy' from 'hold'.
    Defence order prospects are strengthening, it argued, seeing good news likely from the Farnborough airshow 
starting July 19.
    And Xstrata was another climber -- up 3 pence to 727 -- after the same broker raised its recommendation to 'hold' 
from 'sell', arguing that recent rises in thermal coal price forecasts have been priced into the stock.
    Staying with UK stocks, business services blue chip Hays gained around 1 pct after Morgan Stanley repeated its 
'overweight' recommendation and raised its estimates slightly.
    The US broker said Hays' core recruitment business is performing well, with fee income growth seen rising to 11 
pct in the second half of the year, from 5 pct in the first half.
 ITV also moved higher this morning after CSFB lifted its estimates for the broadcaster and raised its target to 52 
pence following Ofcom's decision to allow the UK television company to renegotiate the terms of its broadcast 
licences.
    Elsewhere, Easyjet rose 2.4 pct on reports that founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou is planning a 650 mln stg bid to take 
the group private.
Euroshares slightly firmer midday; US holiday limits activity
    The news came as Ryanair reported a 24 pct rise in June passenger numbers. The airline's June load factor -- 
passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available -- was 87 pct compared to 81 pct in May and 79 pct in 
June last year. Shares in Ryanair rose 0.12 eur to 4.80.
    On the downside, Philips lost nearly 1 pct after Merrill Lynch trimmed its price target on the stock ahead of 
upcoming second-quarter results.
    And Reed Elsevier fell 0.7 pct after Merrill Lynch downgraded the Anglo-Dutch publisher to 'neutral' from 'buy' on 
valuation grounds.
    Its price target on Reed shares went to 580 pence from 625 pence.

The European Commission said it has asked Belgian authorities to give details of the aid they are paying Ireland's 
low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC to operate out of Charleroi airport, south of Brussels.
    Commission aide Gilles Gantelet said the commission needs the information to be able to calculate exactly how 
much of the state aid is illegal.
 The commission has also asked the Belgian authorities to say how they will put an end to the payments, Gantelet 
said.
    "We have given the Belgians 15 days to give us more details," he said.
    The commission ruled in February that approximately 4 mln eur out of 15 mln eur of incentives paid to Ryanair by 
Charleroi airport, which is owned by the local Walloon government, amounted to illegal state aid.
    Ryanair is appealing the decision in the European Court of First Instance.

ROUNDUP - TBI gears up for take off as clouds lift over world air industry

TBI PLC said it sees early signs of a turnaround in its fortunes as the global aviation industry gets back on its feet 
following the Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and as it benefits from the ongoing boom in low-cost air 
travel within Europe.
    The upbeat assessment came despite the UK's number two airport operator reporting a sharp decline in pretax 
profit driven by a 10 mln usd (5.9 mln stg) write-off of goodwill on its struggling US Airport Services business.
    Chief executive Keith Brooks said the business, which offers various services including aircraft re-fuelling and 
baggage handling, would be sold in the near future, along with the company's three airports in Bolivia.
    "We would have sold them before 9/11 but then we had to hold our breath… We hope to be able to sell those 
businesses this financial year," he told AFX News in an interview, adding that the funds raised would be re-invested 
in other operations.
    TBI said it had made a strong start to the new financial year with passenger numbers surging 11 pct when 
compared with the same period a year earlier.
    But Brooks warned "the ongoing threat of geo-political risk or the impact which a serious rise in oil prices could 
have on the industry cannot be underestimated", adding that the company continued to witness downward pressure 
on yields.
    With revenue growth being driven largely by swelling numbers of no-frills passengers, TBI may be vulnerable to 
the recent spate of dire warnings from a number of low cost carriers such as easyJet PLC about cut-throat 
competition.
 Brooks though tried to play down such concerns.
    "What you've seen is reductions in profitability rather than levels of activity," he said.
    Although there could eventually be some downward pressure on prices, leading customers such as easyJet and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC had sufficiently strong balance sheets to weather the storm and continue to grow their 
business, he added.
    TBI reported pretax profit before exceptional charges and the amortisation of goodwill of 23 mln stg in the year to 
March 31, compared with 23.6 mln in the year earlier, on sales up 4.8 pct to 186.2 mln stg.
    That was in the middle of the 22.3-23.5 mln stg range forecast by analysts.
ROUNDUP - TBI gears up for take off as clouds lift over world air industry
    But headline pretax plunged 45 pct to 6.2 mln stg.
    Terminal passengers leapt 15 pct to 17.5 mln during the year.
    That was led by a 31 pct surge in low-cost traffic, primarily as a result of easyJet's decision to expand services 
out of Luton, London's number four airport, and Belfast; Ryanair launching a base at Skavsta airport south of 
Stockholm in April 2003; and a full-year's contribution from BMI British Midland's no-frills unit bmibaby at Cardiff.
    Brooks said the "core" European airports "remain well placed to take advantage of the continued expansion in 
low-cost travel", adding that there was "a clear indication of markedly improved trading across our US businesses".
    Brooks reiterated that TBI chairman Stan Thomas, who owns 20 pct of the shares, had no plans to take the 
company private and contrary to reports had not held talks to that effect.
    He also once again denied the company had received any formal takeover offer from the airports division of 
German construction group Hochtief AG, or any other interested party.
    "We haven't had any approaches… We had no approach from Hochtief. They made an announcement and never 
even picked the phone up to me," the chief executive said.
    Aside from its European and Bolivian airports, TBI runs Sanford airport in Orlando, Florida as well as providing 
various services at a further 21 airports around the world.
    TBI is holding its final dividend payment at 1.6 pence per share, giving a full-year payout of 2.3 pence.
    At 10.26 am, TBI shares were down 1/2 pence at 63-1/2.

aviation industry gets back on its feet following the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and as it

Shares in easyJet PLC slumped over 14 pct after the no-frills airline effectively issued its second profit alert in less 
than five weeks, blaming intense competition in the European market.
    The Luton-based group said it now expects to generate a year to end-September 2004 pretax profit that "at least" 
exceeds the 52 mln stg achieved last time -- assuming a slight easing in global oil prices, that sterling remains 
reasonably strong against the US dollar, and a stable geopolitical environment.
    Analysts pointed out that last year's figure of 52 mln stg was struck after goodwill and "one off" costs associated 
with the Deutsche BA option that easyJet did not take up, the integration of Go and the accelerated depreciation of 
aircraft.
    On the same basis going into today, analysts were forecasting a pretax profit of 80-105 mln stg.
    UBS, easyJet's joint house broker, said a pretax result of 52 mln stg would imply an average fare decline of 
around 10 pct in the July to September quarter.
    "This looks like a worst case scenario but could reflect a decision by easyJet to put pressure on the recent 
converts to the low fare model before the winter arrives," the broker, which has placed its forecasts, target price and 
rating under review, told clients.
    easyJet conceded that the cost of fuel remains a major area of concern. For the second half of the current year it 
has 55 pct of its fuel capped at 301 usd/tonne.
However, for the first two months of the second half, the average fuel price was 360 usd/tonne (before hedging).
    If this price continues, easyJet's results would be adversely affected by around 4 mln stg at current exchange 
rates, it warned.
    By 1.45 pm, shares in the airline were down 28-1/4 pence at 172-1/2, valuing it at 689 mln stg. Shares in rival 
Ryanair Holdings PLC, which issued a profit warning in January, were down 9 cents at 4.6 eur.
    On May 5 easyJet shares lost a quarter of their value after the company adjusted its guidance for the full year to 
"cautious" and said it was seeing "unprofitable and unrealistic pricing" by airlines across all sectors of the European 
industry.
    "We expect this to continue during the rest of the year," easyJet said today.
ROUNDUP easyJet shares slump on new warning
    "While demand for low cost travel remains strong, the forward pricing environment is exceptionally competitive."
    easyJet reiterated that it will "vigorously defend" its market position -- code for more price cuts. It said that unlike 
some airlines it has the financial strength to do so.
    The airline plans to grow capacity by 20 pct in the current year but said deployment for next year is "under 
review" -- suggesting a slowdown is on the cards.
    "We will use our market and financial strength to protect our leading position," said chief executive Ray Webster.
    "While this may have a bearing on the growth in our profits this year, it will ensure sound medium and long-term 
growth for easyJet, in a market place where there will be fewer carriers."
    The airline's new guidance came in a trading update along with its monthly traffic report.
    In May the airline carried 2.09 mln passengers, a 19 pct increase on the same month last year.
    Load factor -- passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available -- was 81 pct compared to 83 pct in 
May last year. In April load factor had fallen 3 pct to 82 pct.
    The figures suggest that easyJet's problems in April have continued into May, with average fares down 5 pct.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Irish budget airline, is to set up its first base in Eastern Europe, as it looks to open up a 
new front in the low-cost travel market as competition intensifies in the UK and Germany, The Business reported, 
citing the company.
    Ryanair said it has six bases "lined up" around Europe: two in the UK, two in France, one in Germany - and one 
in eastern Europe.
It refused to reveal the identities of the prospective hubs, said the newspaper.
    But Ryanair, headed by chief executive Michael O'Leary, is likely to hold off a big push into eastern Europe for 
the next couple of years, the Business said.
    The market-leading airline believes the low-cost market is still underdeveloped in some of the more lucrative 
western European countries, citing the example of low-cost operator Southwest, which has enjoyed several 
decades of growth in the US.
    A Ryanair spokesman told the Business: "Initially there will be a big rush to places like Warsaw but that doesn't 
mean there will be sustainable traffic in both directions."
    While barriers to entry into the eastern European market are low, it may be harder to reduce costs. People also 
tend to have less disposable income than in western European countries, Ryanair said.

    MARKET SENTIMENT
    -The broad market is expected to open higher as overnight gains on Wall Street and expectations for a strong US 
payrolls figure Friday offset rising concerns over the high price of oil.
 "We should see a bit of a bounce this morning on the back of Wall Street's gains," a trader at a local brokerage 
said.
    "And with OPEC set to sharply increase production, we could see a little follow-through (buying) ahead of 
Friday's US jobs report."
    He noted that in the wake of yesterday's strong US ISM manufacturing report for May, showing a sharp increase 
in the employment component, investors are now expecting a strong non-farm payrolls figure when the data is 
released Friday.
    Blue chips and TMTs are likely to rebound from yesterday's losses, though trading will be quiet given the lack of 
newsflow.

(Adds further detail)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based no-frills airline, has reported a profit decline for the first time in its 
quoted history and warned of further yield declines in the current year.
    For the year to March 31 2004 the airline, which operates 150 European routes, made a pretax profit of 228.5 
mln eur -- in line with analyst forecasts, which were slashed after a January profit warning, but down from 264.6 mln 
eur last time.
    Net profit fell to 207 mln eur from 239 mln eur, reflecting a 14 pct decline in yields (average fares) due to intense 
competition all over Europe, plus higher route and airport charges.
    Ryanair's sales increased to 1.07 bln eur from 842.5 mln eur as it carried 23.13 mln passengers, a rise of 47 pct.
    The airline's profit margin before taxation and exceptional items fell from 28 pct last year to 21 pct.
    Earnings per share were 27.3 cents, down from 31.7 cents last time.
    "Our outlook for the coming 12 months remains very conservative," said chief executive Michael O'Leary, 
forecasting passenger traffic growth of circa 20 pct and a seat capacity rise of 16 pct.
    Although Ryanair's current load factors -- passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available -- are 
higher than this time last year, the chief executive still expects yields to decline this year.
    "With almost 50 pct of the seats booked for the summer season, the yield attrition seems to be towards the lower 
end of our forecast range at 5-10 pct, but next winter, as many of our loss making competitors dump prices to try to 
stay alive, we expect the yield declines to increase within a range of 10-20 pct," said O'Leary.
 He said over the coming years Ryanair will lower prices further as it grows its traffic to over 50 mln passengers per 
annum.
    "It remains our medium term view that there will only be one or possibly two large low fares airlines in Europe 
and we are determined that the biggest and lowest cost of these carriers will be Ryanair," O'Leary added.
    The chief executive does not believe the growth of low fare air travel will be damaged or slowed by higher oil 
prices.
    He noted Ryanair is fully hedged until the end of the second quarter and largely unhedged thereafter.
Ryanair FY profit falls - UPDATE
    "Our view is that (fuel) prices will fall this winter, or next year and only then will we hedge, in order to benefit from 
such reductions," said O'Leary, pointing out that Ryanair will absorb higher oil prices by making cost savings in 
other areas. He reiterated that Ryanair will not impose fuel surcharges.
    The airline's unit costs in the year to end-March fell 6 pct with the result that total operating costs rose 39 pct -- 
significantly less than the rate of traffic growth.
    Ryanair also ended the year with cash of 1.2 bln eur.
    O'Leary repeated the airline's view that it will win both of its appeals on the Strasbourg and Charleroi state aid 
cases.
    Ryanair shares closed Friday at 4.34 eur.

Leading shares opened modestly higher after the bank holiday weekend, with oil stocks outperforming as crude 
futures spiked in reaction to the weekend terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia, dealers said.
    By 8.15 am, the FTSE 100 was trading 11.6 points higher at 4,442.2, with the broader indices mixed.
    The US stock market was closed for the Memorial Day weekend yesterday. On Friday, the DJIA closed down 
16.75 points at 10,188.45, while the the Nasdaq Composite ended up 2.24 points at 1,986.74.
    It is a very quiet morning for blue-chip corporate news, and Marks & Spencer continued to dominate the 
headlines after the troubled retailer yesterday sacked its chief executive as a defensive move against the expected 
takeover bid this week from billionaire retail entrepreneur Philip Green.
    M&S sacked Roger Holmes as its chief executive and parachuted in Stuart Rose, the former boss of Arcadia, 
Booker and Argos, as his successor. It also removed, with immediate effect, outgoing chairman Luc Vandevelde.
    Shares jumped 9-1/2 pence to 369.
    Meanwhile, the heavily weighted energy sector rose this morning on expectations of a rise in crude prices after 
the weekend attack on an oil complex in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, left 22 people dead.
    Shell added 4-3/4 pence to 399 and BP rose 6 to 483-3/4.
    Elsewhere, Ryanair took on 0.11 eur to 4.45 after a better-than-expected set of full-year figures.
    As expected, Ryanair indicated that pricing pressures in the budget sector will continue to intensify, with Summer 
season passenger yields seen declining at the 'lower end' of its 5-10 pct forecast, and Winter yields seen falling by 
between 10-20 pct.
 On the economic front, this morning will see the release of the May CIPS survey of UK manufacturing, and the 
CBI's quarterly distributive trades report.
    Attention will soon switch to this afternoon's ISM survey for May. The headline index is expected to fall to 60.6, 
down from 62.4 the previous month.

Leading shares are expected to open slightly higher as investors return to their desks after the bank holiday 
weekend, with oil stocks expected to outperform after the energy price spiked in reaction to the weekend terrorist 
attacks in Saudi Arabia, dealers said.
    According to spread betting firm Cantor Index, the FTSE 100 is expected to open at around 4,438, 8 points 
above Friday's closing level.
    The US stock market was closed for the Memorial Day weekend yesterday. On Friday, the DJIA closed down 
16.75 points at 10,188.45, while the the Nasdaq Composite ended up 2.24 points at 1,986.74.
    Attention is likely to remain focused on the oil price morning, as crude futures rose around 2 pct yesterday after 
the weekend attack on an oil complex in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, left 22 people dead.
    In a very quiet morning for corporate news, Marks & Spencer will continue to dominate the headlines after the

Green, the billionaire retail entrepreneur who owns Bhs and Arcadia.
    M&S sacked Roger Holmes as its chief executive and parachuted in Stuart Rose, the former boss of Arcadia, 
Booker and Argos, as his successor. It also removed, with immediate effect, outgoing chairman Luc Vandevelde.
    Elsewhere, Ryanair will be under the spotlight after the no-frills airline reported full-year figures that were broadly 
in line with expectations.
    The budget carrier said full-year pretax earnings amounted to 228 mln eur, down from 265 mln the previous year, 
in line with Deutsche Bank's 227.3 mln eur forecast.
 As expected, Ryanair indicated that pricing pressures in the budget sector will continue to intensify, with Summer 
season passenger yields seen declining at the 'lower end' of its 5-10 pct forecast, and Winter yields seen falling by 
between 10-20 pct.
    In other news, Eircom is due to release its first full-year results since re-listing earlier this year.
    The incumbent telecoms carrier should post fiscal 2004 revenues of 1.632 bln eur, with EBITDA of 595 mln eur 
and pretax profits of 39 mln eur, according to Deutsche Bank.
    The broker's net debt target is 1.912 bln eur, below the company's 2.0 bln target.

Shares in Europe's main bourses are expected to open slightly higher in quiet opening trade but thin newsflow and 
the still strong oil price could cap gains after the long bank holiday weekends in London and New York, dealers 
said.
    Last Friday, the DJIA closed down 16.75 points, or 0.2 percent, at 10,188.45 while German and French shares 
closed slightly higher last night.
    This morning, the Nikkei ended the morning up 42.66 points at 11,279.03 while the Hang Seng ended the 
morning up 12.96 points at 12,211.20.
    But the higher oil price -- after the weekend attacks in Saudi Arabia -- could continue to weigh on sentiment 
ahead of this week's OPEC meeting.
    In corporate news, budget airline Ryanair reported a full year net profit of 207 mln eur, down from 239 mln eur a 
year earlier and a pretax profit of 228 mln eur, down from a year earlier figure of 265 mln eur.
    Swiss staffing group, Adecco, reported a 26 pct rise in full year net profit to 305 mln eur and a full year operating 
proft of 505 mln eur, up from 446 mln eur a year earlier.
    In other news, Bayer could be in focus amid reports it is one of the six companies on the short-list to buy Roche's 
non-prescription drug business.
    And the retail sector is likley to garner some interest after the news late last night that UK chain Marks & Spencer 
has sacked Roger Holmes as chief executive, replacing him with Stuart Rose, the former boss of Arcadia, Booker 
and Argos.
 The move has been interpreted as a sign the board is determined to fight off a bid from Philip Green, the billionaire 
retail entrepreneur.
    Also in the sector, clothing retailer H&M may be in focus after Dagens Industri said the group is looking to enter 
new markets such as Japan and Russia.
    In the banking sector, HSBC is reportedly seeking opportunities to buy into banks on the mainland, but declined 
to comment on reports that it will buy a 20 pct stake in the Bank of Communications soon, the Shanghai Morning 
Post reported.
    The banking group reportedly faces competition from JP Morgan for the stake.
Euroshares opening - seen slightly higher but oil price fears seen weighing
    On the economic front, strategists will be digesting Euro zone GDP and Manufacturing data. Some fear the PMI 
data will show a slowing in new orders.
    In the US, construction spending and May ISM data are likely to attract some interest.

Shares in Europe's main bourses were sharply lower midday as rising oil prces unsettled investors in an otherwise 
lacklustre day of trading, dealers said.
    At 11.45, the STOXX 50 was off 14.78 points at 2659.83 and the STOXX 600 was off 1.45 points lower at 
235.84.
    Spreadbetting firms IG Index and Cantor Index said Wall Street is set to open 45 points lower.
    Brent crude futures soared in early morning electronic deals as the weekend's fatal attacks on foreign workers in 
Saudi Arabia rekindled fears of possible future supply disruptions from OPEC's largest producer.
    Shares in car companies DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen were off 1.69 pct and 1.45 pct respectively.
    But Fiat outperformed -- up 3.03 pct -- ahead of the group's board meeting this afternoon, as observers expect 
the Italian group to appoint board member Sergio Marchionne -- currently chief executive at SGS -- as chief 
executive.
    If appointed, he will replace Giuseppe Morchio who resigned on Sunday.
    SGS shares were suspended at the behest of the company. They had fallen more than 6 pct on the news in early 
trade. Deutsche Bank cut the shares to 'hold' from 'buy'.
    Airlines were also mostly lower as the New York oil futures rose to 41 usd per barrel -- close to year highs.
    Air France slipped 0.76 pct and Alitalia fell 0.53 pct. And budget airline Ryanair fell 2.28 pct after uninspiring full 
year numbers failed to offset concerns about the potential impact of oil prices remaining at this level for an extended 
period.
 The group's cautious outlook statement also deterred investors.
    Dresdner cut its price target on the airline to 4 eur from 5.5 eur and repeated its 'hold' stance.
    Chemicals fared better despite their heavy exposure to the oil price as investors say caution on the sector has 
already priced in a difficult outlook. ICI was up 1.83 pct after UBS upgraded its recommendation on the group to 
'buy' from 'neutral'. But ailing French group Rhodia fell 2.8 pct after a report in La Tribune said the group is facing 
total costs of between 50-100 mln usd after being found guilty on pollution charges by a US court.
    After delaying its earnings report several times, Swiss staffing group Adecco reported a 26 pct rise in full year net 
profit to 305 mln eur and a full year operating profit of 505 mln eur, up from 446 mln eur a year earlier.
Euroshares lower midday as oil price rises
    There had been fears the company would have to restate its earnings. Relief the company published its results 
within the deadline and news it has cut costs and lifted its dividend helped lift the shares, despite disappointment on 
earnings and market share in the US.
    Shares moved up 6.79 pct.
    Oil companies outperformed thanks to the oil price rise. BP was 0.94 pct higher and ENI was off only 0.54 pct. 
Statoil climbed 2.66 pct after it was upgraded to 'buy' from 'hold' at Citigroup Smith Barney after the US broker lifted 
its price target to 95 skr from 90 skr.
    Oil services groups Technip and Saipem added 1.27 pct and 0.76 pct on hopes the sustained high oil price will 
help them win new contracts.
    On the economic front, strategists will be digesting US construction spending and May ISM data are likely to 
attract some interest.

Shares in Europe's main bourses opened slightly higher in quiet opening trade but thin newsflow and the still strong

York, dealers said.
    At 08.45, the STOXX 50 was off 5.62 points at 2668.99 and the STOXX 600 was off 0.5 points at 236.79.
    Oil companies were boosted by the oil price rise after the weekend attacks in Saudi Arabia and ahead of this 
week's OPEC meeting. Royal Dutch led the STOXX 50 risers, up 0.53 pct. Total added 0.39 pct, ENI added 0.34 
pct and Repsol was up 0.4 pct. Statoil has been upgraded to 'buy' from 'hold' at Citigroup Smith Barney after the US 
broker lifted its price target to 95 skr from 90 skr.
    In corporate news, budget airline Ryanair moved up 1.37 pct after the group reported a full year net profit of 207 
mln eur, down from 239 mln eur a year but at the top end of analysts' reduced expectations.
    And Swiss staffing group Adecco reported a 26 pct rise in full year net profit to 305 mln eur and a full year 
operating profit of 505 mln eur, up from 446 mln eur a year earlier.
    There had been fears the company -- which delayed its earnings report -- would have to restate its earnings. 
Relief the company published its results within the deadline and news it has cut costs and lifted its dividend helped

Euroshares open flat as oil price rise, thin newsflow keeps volumes light
    But SGS tumbled 5.82 pct as the market took the news badly amid uncertainty about what the move could mean 
for the Swiss tech group.
    In the healthcare sector, Bayer was off 0.09 pct amid reports it is among six bidders on the shortlist for Roche's 
non prescription drugs business.
    And Nokia fell 1.49 pct after rising more than 2.4 pct yesterday following news the group had clawed back some 
market share.
    On the economic front, strategists will be digesting Euro zone GDP and Manufacturing data. Some fear the PMI

No-frills airliner Ryanair Holdings PLC is refusing to pay back alleged state subsidies arising from its operations at 
Belgium's Charleroi airport, The Financial Times reported.
    Chief executive Michael O'Leary said yesterday that the Belgian authorities had written to the airline demanding 
the repayment of around 3 mln eur.
    O'Leary said that Ryanair had incurred costs eight times higher than the alleged state aid in setting up its base at 
Charleroi, according to the FT.
    The Dublin-based low cost operator also formally launched its appeal against the decision of the European 
Commission that various benefits it had received at Charleroi airport constituted illegal state aid.

Ryanair Holdings PLC confirmed it is to launch an appeal against the European Commission's ruling that the 
company received illegal state aid at Charleroi airport in Brussels.
    "The Commission's decision completely ignored the fact that the agreement between Ryanair and the airport 
arose after intense negotiations with several other airports," the company said.
 The low cost airline said it has similar and "in fact lower costs at private airports. Under the state aid rules, a public 
airport must be able to compete on a level playing field with private airports and to offer the same conditions.
    "The Commission's decision in Charleroi ignored these lower cost agreements and will prevent public airports 
from competing on a level playing field for new routes and passenger growth and will lead to less low fares, 
competition and choice for European consumers."

British Airways PLC is extending the savage airline price war to long-haul routes with a summer offensive that will

    The cuts are aimed at premium seats and are spread across 28 long-haul Club World routes, plus 75 Club 
Europe routes, the paper said.
 "We are taking the price war long-haul. The scale of these reductions is unprecedented for BA," the spokesman 
said.
    The news comes a week after BA slashed 30 pct from 38 short-haul European routes from Gatwick, where there 
is a vicious price battle between network carriers and low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Easyjet.

 Easyjet confirmed. "We are in discussions with Brussels-National airport but no definitive accord has been signed."
    If the parties reach an agreement, Easyjet will not be able to operate in Brussels until the beginning of next year, 
after the airport has been fully privatised.
    Klees said: "In theory, nothing will be finalised before the end of the privatisation process of the airport since we 
do not want to take the decision before designating our future reference shareholders."
    At present, national flag carrier SN Brussels and rival no-frills airline Virgin Express Holdings PLC operate out of

ROUNDUP BA warning on fuel costs takes shine off increased FY profits
ROUNDUP BA warning on fuel costs takes shine off increased FY profits

British Airways PLC reported a sharp rise in full year profit towards the top end of market expectations, driven by 
aggressive cost cutting, a recovery in longhaul premium travel and progress in restructuring its shorthaul business.
    But shares in the flag carrier fell after it warned it expects its fuel bill to be 150 mln stg higher in the year to March 
31 2005, compared to previous guidance of a 50 mln stg rise.
    Last week BA imposed a 5 stg tariff on return tickets to counter the impact of rising oil prices which recently hit 13 
year highs, breaching the 40 usd a barrel level.
    Chairman Lord Marshall remained cautious on the airline's continuing recovery, forecasting a 2-3 pct revenue 
improvement in the current year after falling 1.7 pct to 7.56 bln stg in the year to March 31 2004.
    "We expect small yield declines in the full year will be more than offset by volume," he said, noting that market 
conditions have not changed since BA's third quarter announcement in February.
    "Longhaul premium volumes are recovering steadily, while shorthaul premium remains at lower levels. Non-
premium volumes are very price sensitive."
    BA's full year yields fell 4.3 pct but were up 3.9 pct in the fourth quarter, while the full year load factor -- 
passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available -- was up 1.1 pct at 73.0 pct.
    Last Friday BA announced price cuts of "up to a third" to 38 major European destinations departing from London 
Gatwick, stoking up the price war with easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC.
 "We expect the competitive environment to be really tough again," chief executive Rod Eddington told reporters.
    "You only need to look at the amount of additional capacity coming into the market, particularly shorthaul 
capacity, to realise that yields are still going to be under pressure."
    BA made a pretax profit of 230 mln stg compared to analysts' expectations of 100-253 mln stg and 135 mln stg 
last year and made an operating profit of 405 mln stg compared to analyst forecasts of 350-412 mln stg and 295 
mln stg last time.
    The full year outcome was assisted by a much better fourth quarter -- a pretax profit of 45 mln stg versus a 200 
mln stg loss and an operating profit of
32 mln stg versus a loss of 164 mln stg.
ROUNDUP BA warning on fuel costs takes shine off increased FY profits
    The operating margin of 5.4 pct was 1.6 pct better than the previous year.
    Underlying pretax losses on BA's shorthaul business narrowed to 60 mln stg from 117 mln stg last time -- a 
performance entirely due to improvements in the cost base, such as cutting distribution costs by selling a greater 
proportion of tickets on-line and improving the utilisation of the shorthaul fleet.
    For the third year in a row BA decided against paying a dividend, preferring
to conserve cash and cut debt. It ended the period with net debt of 4.16 bln stg, the lowest level since Dec 31, 
1997.
    The airline exceeded its two year 'Future Size and Shape' targets. It achieved 869 mln stg in cost savings against 
a target of 650 mln stg and its manpower reduction by March 2004 was 13,082 against a target of 13,000.
    In January the airline announced plans to cut a further 300 mln stg from its wage bill by March 2006 through 
voluntary redundancies and improvements to working practices in a bid to deliver its long-targeted 10 pct operating 
margin.
    "We're beginning to make some inroads there," said Eddington. "We're working with the unions and the 
workforce to find sensible ways to address staff costs and that's ongoing."
    The unions have, however, refused to help meet the 133 mln stg increase in pension costs BA is facing.
    By 12.44 pm shares in BA were down 5-3/4 pence at 241, valuing the airline at 2.61 bln stg.
    But despite the fall several brokers remain bullish on BA's prospects.
    Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein reiterated its 'buy' stance, telling clients: "Higher oil prices strengthen cost 
headwinds and management's yield conservatism is understandable but the earnings recovery is intact."
    The broker kept its underlying pretax profit forecasts for the current and following years unchanged at 430 mln 
stg and 660 mln stg respectively.

(Updating to add detail)
     British Airways PLC said it has cut European airfares by "up to a third" on major routes departing from London 
Gatwick.
    It said fares are now reduced by up to 30 stg return throughout the year to 38 European destinations.
 The flag carrier highlighted fares to Pisa, Prague and Naples that have been reduced from 99 stg to 69 stg return, 
inclusive of all taxes, fees and charges (including the fuel surcharge of 5.0 stg per return ticket announced earlier 
this week) and returns to Dublin and Jersey from 59 stg.
    Fares to Venice, Barcelona and Madrid now start from 69 stg return from 89 stg previously, while fares to 
Malaga, Menorca and Valencia, on flights operated by BA's franchise partner GB Airways, have also been cut to 69 
stg from 99 stg.
    The catch is the lower fares are subject to availability on off peak flights -- passengers must depart Gatwick on 
Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays -- and must be booked 28 days in advance.
    BA's price cuts will stoke up the price war in the European shorthaul market. Both Ryanair Holdings PLC and 
easyJet PLC have recently issued profit warnings and talked of a fares bloodbath in the summer season.
    BA is scheduled to report its year to March 31 2004 results on Monday.
    At 11.40 am shares in BA were down 3-1/4 pence at 252-3/4.

(Updating to add more detail from BAA statement)
     BAA PLC, operator of seven UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, said it handled 11.4 mln 
passengers in April, an increase of 15 pct compared to April 2003.
    The result continues an underlying trend of steady improvement in passenger numbers.
    BAA noted that among the key markets, the highest growth was recorded on routes most affected last year by 
the SARS epidemic and the Iraq War.
    North Atlantic traffic increased 18.6 pct while other long haul recorded a rise of 27.5 pct.
    On European scheduled routes, low cost airlines drove growth of 19.4 pct, but this increase compares with April 
2003 when Buzz services were temporarily suspended prior to its acquisition by Ryanair Holdings PLC.
    Domestic routes rose 6.5 pct, while European charter traffic remained weak, showing a 3.4 pct decrease.
    Heathrow saw a robust recovery against the previous year recording an increase of 14.9 pct, taking the airport's 
12 month total close to 65 mln for the first time.
    Traffic at Stansted grew 33.9 pct, Gatwick was up 8.4 pct, Southampton 36.3 pct and BAA's Scottish airports 7.9 
pct.
    The number of air transport movements rose 8.1 pct during the month and there was a further acceleration in the 
rate of growth in cargo activity, with tonnage rising 6.9 pct.
    BAA is scheduled to report year to March 31 2004 results on Tuesday May 18.
    In February, the group said it was comfortable with analysts' consensus pretax profit before exceptional items 
forecast of 526 mln stg, up from 524 mln last time.
 It also said that, notwithstanding external shocks, it was comfortable with market forecasts of passenger growth of 
5 pct for the year to end-March 2005.
    BAA shares closed Wednesday at 526-1/2 pence, valuing the group at 5.64 bln stg.

Iberia, Lineas Aereas de Espana SA has no immediate plans to introduce a fuel surcharge to its fares in response 
to rising oil prices, a source close to the company said.
    The source's comments follow British Airways PLC's announcement yesterday of a separate surcharge of 2.50 
stg per flight sector to fares from May 13.
Return fares will have 5 stg added to them, the UK flag carrier said.
    An analyst at a leading European bank noted that although all major US airlines have introduced a similar 
surcharge, "we do not believe that demand is strong enough to absorb this increase" in Europe.
    Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC have both announced that they will not introduce a fuel levy despite the 
rising price of oil, which recently breached 40 usd a barrel for the first time in 13 years.

(Updating to add response from easyJet PLC)
     British Airways PLC said it will introduce a fuel surcharge to its fares in response to the rising price of oil, which 
recently breached 40 usd a barrel for the first time in 13 years.
    The flag carrier will add 2.50 stg per flight sector as a separate fuel surcharge to ticket prices in the UK from May 
13. Return fares will have 5 stg added to them.
    The fuel surcharge applies to all fares sold across the BA global network. In all markets outside of the UK a 
surcharge of 4 usd per flight sector will be added.
    "Due to the continuing fluctuations in the price of oil BA will review this surcharge on a regular basis with a view 
to adjusting it when appropriate," it said.
    BA's surcharge follows a similar move by Australian carrier Qantas Airways Ltd.
    However, Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Irish no-frills carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC yesterday pledged not 
to introduce a fuel levy.
    Today easyJet PLC, the Luton-based low cost carrier that issued a profit warning last week, also promised not to 
impose a fuel surcharge and criticised BA's move.
    Ray Webster, easyJet chief executive, predicted BA's move would be
"disastrously counter-productive".
    "If they want to fill their aircraft, BA should get the prices right. If they can't make money they should reduce 
capacity," he said.
    Nevertheless BA's surcharge may go some way to placating analysts' fears that its earnings could be decimated 
by the escalating price of jet fuel.
 Only yesterday, Citigroup Smith Barney lowered its current year forecast for operating profit by 18 pct to 482 mln 
stg as it factored in those rising costs.
    By 2.15 pm shares in BA were up 8 pence, or 3 pct, at 262, while easyJet was up 1/4 pence at 220-1/2 and 
Ryanair was up 13 cents at 4.55 eur.

 He said the Ayreshire council has issued a "ludicrous rate demand of 111,000 stg - unlike other UK regions which 
were offering rate holidays for 10 years."
    O'Leary said Ryanair will "halt all further job creation at this facility until this highway robbery is reversed".

Ryanair Holdings PLC said traffic figures to be released later today for April will confirm the company's continuing 
strong growth, but in a very demanding yield environment.
    The company also today confirmed to its staff that it would proceed with a 3 pct pay increase effective April 1 
2004.
 This increase, which would equate to up to 2,000 eur extra per annum of the basic pay of pilots, will be 
implemented in the May payroll and will be backdated to April 1.
    Ryanair was quick to clarify that this pay increase was not any indication of better times ahead, but rather an 
appropriate reward for the continued productivity gains delivered by its people.
    Chief executive Michael O'Leary said: "Whilst we expect the coming year to be tough and the Winter to be 
particularly difficult, this pay increase at this time is both a vote of thanks and a demonstration of our confidence in 
our people who will continue to drive efficiency and continue to widen the substantial cost and price advantage 
Ryanair has over all other airlines in Europe."

ROUNDUP EasyJet shares slump on 'cautious' FY guidance
ROUNDUP EasyJet shares slump on 'cautious' FY guidance

Shares in easyJet PLC lost a quarter of their value in morning trading after the Luton-based no-frills airline reported 
an underlying interim loss in line with market expectations but adjusted its guidance for the full year to "cautious" 
just three months after telling shareholders at its annual meeting it was "cautiously optimistic".
    Chief executive Ray Webster blamed the "increasingly competitive marketplace" for the change in stance.
    "We are currently seeing unprofitable and unrealistic pricing by airlines, across all sectors of the European 
industry, seeking to grow or maintain their market share," he warned.
    He said easyJet is "reacting vigorously" to this price activity by continuing to extend its reach, growing capacity 
by some 20 pct this year, maintaining its leading market position and optimising the use of its scale.
    Webster still forecast "continued and sustainable progress" for the year but the stock market was unforgiving and 
brokers said they would have to take the red pen to year to end-Sept 2004 pretax profit forecasts of around 100 mln 
stg.
    By 10.22 am easyJet shares were down 61-1/2 pence at 230-3/4 having touched a low of 216 pence. Low cost 
rival Ryanair Holdings PLC was down 18 cents at 4.52 eur in sympathy.
    EasyJet noted that demand in the first half of April was in line with internal expectations, but softened in the 
second half due to continued competitive pressure and a weaker-than-expected Easter.
    Consequently, for the full month of April the load factor (number of passengers as a percentage of available 
capacity) fell 3 pct to 82 pct, although passenger numbers were up 14 pct at 1.95 mln and fares were down 5 pct, 
partially accounted for by timing differences between Easter and the May Bank Holiday.
 For May, easyJet's passenger numbers are "tracking slightly lower" than internal expectations, but are currently "as 
we anticipated" for June.
    For the six months to March 31 2004, the airline, which historically makes the majority of its profits in the last 
quarter of its financial year, made a loss before tax and goodwill of 18.5 mln stg -- in line with analysts' forecasts of 
zero to 25 mln stg, with a consensus of 18 mln stg, and versus a loss before tax, goodwill and non-recurring items 
of 24.4 mln stg last time.
    Reported pretax losses narrowed to 27.3 mln stg from 48.1 mln, on revenue up 18.0 pct to 439.7 mln stg.
    EasyJet's average fare increased 1.6 pct to 38.06 stg and the load factor edged up 1.1 pct to 83.3 pct.
ROUNDUP EasyJet shares slump on 'cautious' FY guidance
    Passengers carried increased 15.9 pct to 10.8 mln, in line with the planned growth in capacity over the period of 
15 pct.
    The carrier kept a tight lid on costs, which per ASK (Available Seat Kilometres) were stable at 4.17 pence, and 
ended the half year with 340 mln stg of cash.
    EasyJet also announced that financing has been secured for 82 aircraft from its order of 120 Airbus A319s.
    The order was originally placed in Oct 2002 and the first 12 aircraft have already been delivered to the airline's 
bases in Geneva and London Gatwick.
    GE, Royal Bank of Scotland, Babcock & Brown Asset Management and HSH Nordbank together with Natexis 
Banques Populaires will provide mortgage-finance for 36 aircraft and sale and lease-back agreements for 46 
aircraft.
    The program includes the sale of assets for 163 mln stg cash, and subsequent operating leaseback for up to 10 
years. The arrangements cover all 2004 deliveries, virtually all deliveries in 2005 and a proportion of those in 2006 
and 2007.
    EasyJet currently operates 115 routes, in 13 countries to 39 airports. A further 38 routes including five new 
destinations have already been announced for the second half.

Prudential Equity upped U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley   to overweight overnight. The stock is down 16

Deutsche Bank raised its rating on Sprint Corp.   to buy overnight. "FON has been extremely weak over the past 
few weeks, falling from $19-20 before first quarter results to the current range below $17.50. We believe this has 
been caused by weak newsflow in the IXC segment and legacy-PCS selldowns following recombination. Weak 
earnings from AT&T   and lower MCI guidance have negative implications for Sprint's GMG business, but we point 
out that LD only accounts for 18 percent of FON's 2004 EBITDA and less than 10 percent of fair value. Shares rose 
55 cents at $17.94.

Duo Airways Limited on Saturday called in administrators, as it became the latest casualty of the increasingly cut-
throat competition facing Europe's low-cost airline industry.
    In a statement issued on its website, Duo said two partners of accountancy firm Deloitte had been appointed joint 
administrators of the no-frills airline based in Birmingham, central England.
 "Following this appointment, Duo has ceased to trade and there will be no further flights," it said.
    The company's demise comes less than a fortnight after the head of Europe's biggest low-cost carrier gave a dire 
about the damage being inflicted by continuing fare wars.
    "Some (airlines) will not survive … There will be casualties this winter," Ryanair Holdings PLC chief executive 
Michael O'Leary warned.
    Duo had been trading for less than a year, offering return flights to more than a dozen European destinations 
from Birmingham and Edinburgh.

Ryanair Holdings PLC CEO Michael O'Leary reaffirmed the carrier's full year net profit guidance as he warned that 
the next winter season will be "awful" in the European airline sector in general.
    "We will be helping to make it awful," he was quoted as saying by the Financial Times.
 Amid continuing fare wars, a shake-out among the recent start-up low-cost airlines is likely. "Some will not survive 
… There will be casualties this winter," he added.
    The most difficult markets are Germany and the UK regions, he said.
    Ryanair yields or average fare levels could fall by between 5-20 pct this year following a fall of 15 pct in the year 
to March, he said.
    With a 20 pct decline in yields Ryanair would only break even, O'Leary added.
    The group is due to report full-year results on June 1. These will be in line with current guidance for a 10 pct fall 
in net profits, he said.
    O'Leary said he was unable to give profit guidance for Ryanair for the year to March 2005 because the outlook is 
so uncertain.

Ryanair Holdings PLC will launch "early next month" its appeal against the European Commission's ruling that it 
received illegal state aid at Charleroi airport, according to a report in the Financial Times, citing Ryanair.
    The commission ruled in February that approximately 4 mln eur out of 15 mln eur of incentives paid to Ryanair by 
Charleroi airport, which is owned by the local Walloon government, amounted to illegal state aid.
    Ryanair will appeal the decision in the European Court of First Instance, a process which could take up to two 
years, in the hope of avoiding having to repay the subsidies, said the report.

The EU Commission said it was still waiting for the details of a new deal between Charleroi Airport and Ryanair, 
and urged the Belgian government to implement its February decision, which imposed a fine on Ryanair for 
receiving illegal state subsidies.
    Ryanair had threatened to pull out of the regional airport, 46 km from Brussels, after the commission ruled in 
February that about 4 mln eur of subsidies received from the local Wallonia government were illegal.
    A new deal struck between the Charleroi airport, owned by the Wallonia government, and Ryanair was 
announced over the weekend, and is now the subject of another commission probe.
    Asked to comment on a claim by Ryanair that it could maintain the same cost base as prior to the February 
decision, commission spokesman Gerassimos Thomas replied that the deal would be investigated when details 
were received.
    "We are not aware of the arrangement agreed between the Waloon government as announced in the press," said 
Thomas.
    He added: "What we are expecting, in line with the February decision, is a plan from Federal Belgian authorities 
about how they plan to move on with the application of this decision," he added.
    "As long as this kind of arrangement is agreed between Ryanair and the Waloon government, we will have to 
examine it as and when we receive the detail," he said.
    According to press reports, by adjusting local taxes for all carriers arriving at Charleroi, Ryanair will pay no more 
than the 5 eur per passenger it is currently charged for its 11 routes into the airport.
 The deal will have to be renegotiated once passenger volumes exceed 2 mln a year, because beyond this point 
airport subsidies must end, according to EU rules on state aid.
    Last year, 1.8 mln passengers flew via Charleroi.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has reached an agreement with Brussels Charleroi Airport and the Walloon Authorities 
which will enable all of its eleven existing low fare routes served from Brussels Charleroi to continue with no change

    Under the agreement, the existing airport and handling charges will continue until the airport reaches 2 mln 
passengers per year -- when 3rd party competitive handling will be introduced.
 In addition, legislation will be enacted by the Walloon Authorities in order to make the Ryanair discounted 
arrangements available to other airlines operating at Brussels Charleroi Airport.
    Thirdly, Ryanair have agreed to actively explore possibilities for basing more aircraft at, and opening new routes 
from, Brussels Charleroi Airport, subject to a new terminal being constructed.
    The airport will provide a competitive cost offer for these new routes which would be similar to the other lower 
cost offers presently available from a number of other privately and publicly owned airports, it said.

German budget airline Air Berlin said it has no plans to leave Berlin as its hub and headquarters, despite comments 
by its managing director suggesting it would quit the capital in a row over subsidies paid to its UK-based competitor 
easyJet PLC.
    "As before, we are annoyed about the subsidy policy and are suing against it
too. But we are not planning to leave Berlin," said a spokesman for the airline,
Peter Hauptvogel.
    Air Berlin managing director Joachim Hunold told the Super-Illu magazine at
the weekend that if the Berlin city government continues with its current
airport policy, "we really have to think hard if it (Berlin) is still the place
for us to be, and if Berlin is the right name for our airline."
    Air Berlin recently sued Berlin-Brandenburg Flughafen Holding (BBF), the
company running the former East German airport of Berlin-Schoenefeld, in which
the federal government and the states of Berlin and Brandenburg all have stakes,
for luring easyJet to the airport by offering reduced landing fees and a
marketing subsidy.
    The case is expected to be heard by a court in Potsdam next month.
    BBF spokeswoman Rosemarie Meicksner said a similar offer had been made to
Air Berlin but turned down.
    "It is now up to Hunold if he wants to return to the negotiating table,"
said Meicksner.
    The subsidy row between Air Berlin, BBF and easyJet is the latest
surrounding the no-frills airline industry in Europe.
    Earlier today, Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has reached agreement with
Brussels Charleroi Airport and the Walloon regional government which will enable

 Ryanair said in February it was terminating its route between London

part of the subsidies the low-cost carrier received from the Walloon government
were illegal.

Ryanair to maintain Charleroi ops despite EU ruling - report

Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC is to maintain its operations at Belgium's Charleroi airport despite a 
European Commission ruling against it over illegal subsidies there, the regional government was reported as saying 
Friday.
    Cited by the Belga news agency, local Wallonia economy minister Serge Kubla said he had signed an accord 
with Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary in Dublin guaranteeing that the low-cost pioneer would stay at Charleroi.
 The deal, for a "transition period," would allow Ryanair to pay exactly the same costs as it had before the February 
ruling the European Commission, which ordered the Irish airline to reimburse some money it had received.
    The terms of the deal would last "between a few months and a maximum of about a year," said Kubla.
    The Walloon minister said the deal was in line with the commission ruling, which found that Ryanair had 
benefitted unfairly from secret clauses in its contract with the Wallonia regional government, which owns Charleroi.
    The European Commission ordered the airline to repay millions of euros it received due to the contract, which 
enabled it to receive steep discounts on landing fees and ground-handling charges, as well as help marketing and 
training costs.
    Ryanair is appealing against the Commission's decision in the European Court in Luxembourg.
    Ryanair said after the February ruling that it would close its route from London to Charleroi on April 29, but said it 
was ready to negotiate a new deal with airport and regional authorities allowing it to keep its costs low.

Malaysia 's AirAsia says new budget airlines will 'not hurt' its business
Malaysia's AirAsia says new budget airlines will 'not hurt' its business

KUALA LUMPUR (AX-ASIA) - Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia said it is unfazed by a looming dogfight over 
Southeast Asian skies as rivalry heats up after Australia's Qantas entered the fray this week.
    The airline's executive director Kamarudin Meranum told Agence France Presse that the emergence of other 
budget carriers will not hurt its business despite the possibility of fierce competition.
    Qantas Airways Ltd said on Tuesday it has teamed up with the Singapore government and two other investors to 
set up a low-cost airline, which is yet to be named, and is due to start operations in May.
    Two other low-cost carriers, which are also expected to enter the market by year-end, are Singapore Airlines' 49 
pct-owned unit Tiger Airlines and  privately-owned Valuair.
    "I don't see them as a threat. Instead it is a honor for AirAsia that others are following our success story," he said.
    Kamarudin said AirAsia will not rush into expansion plans, including a planned initial public offering (IPO) later 
this year as other budget carriers appear.
    "We will proceed with our development programs as planned. We will do it at our own pace. We are confident, 
these new set-ups will not hurt our business," he said.
    Citing an example, Kamarudin said its maiden flight to Indonesia's capital on Saturday from the southern Johor 
state is completely booked. "Even our flight on Sunday is full."
    AirAsia charges just half of the 820 rgt fare imposed by national carrier Malaysia Airlines and Garuda Indonesia.
 Some AirAsia tickets for Indonesia start as low as 23 usd.
    "We are doing our best. God willing we will succeed in Indonesia too," Kamarudin said.
    AirAsia already flies to Thailand and Singapore.
    AirAsia had named BBMB Securities as a third bookrunner for its IPO, expected to be launched in September, 
after earlier appointing Credit Suisse First Boston and RHB Sakura Merchant Bankers.
    AirAsia plans to invest 228 mln rgt as it builds up its fleet to 30 aircraft by year-end from the current 14.
    The two-year-old Malaysian company has become Southeast Asia's version of European budget carrier Ryanair. 
It has carried more than four mln passengers since it was launched in Dec 2001.
    Azrul Azwar, economist with MIDF Sisma Holdings Sdn Bhd told AFP that despite emerging competition from 
low-cost airlines, AirAsia holds the high ground since they are already operating their business with success.
Malaysia 's AirAsia says new budget airlines will 'not hurt' its business
    "I think AirAsia will fly well ahead of others. Others have not even began their operations" he said.
    Azrul said he expects AirAsia's IPO to do well although Asian skies will be crowded.
    "Their IPO will command a good take-up. The company is the pioneer in low cost airlines in Asia," he said.
    Azrul said AirAsia's efficient management and rich cash base stand it in good stead.
    "Definitely, Indonesia is a lucrative market. Imagine there are some one million Indonesians working in Malaysia. 
It means they already have a captive market and with their low rates, there will be a scramble for its seats," he said.

easyJet PLC, the Luton-based no-frills airline, said it carried 2.0 mln passengers in March, a rise of 16.6 pct on the 
same month last year.
    Load factor -- the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available -- was up 1 pct at 87 
pct.
 The rolling 12 months passenger total was 21.8 mln, with a load factor of 84.5 pct.
    The load factor compares well with that reported by rival Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday.
    The Dublin based carrier reported a March load factor of 78 pct, reflecting its struggle to fill the extra capacity it 
has added.
    "Both our passenger numbers and load factor continue to show steady improvement, reflecting the reliability and 
sustainability of our low-cost model in a growing and competitive market," said easyJet chief executive Ray 
Webster.
    He noted that throughout March the airline took delivery of four Airbus A319
aircraft, bringing the total Airbus fleet to 10.
    "These aircraft are supporting our need for increased capacity and have consistently outperformed our 
expectations in terms of reliability and passenger popularity."
    easyJet has previously stated that for the year to end-Sept 2004 it expects slightly improved load factors and a 
similar yield to last year.
    It has said load factors and yields for the first half to end-March were anticipated to be above last year. But, 
reflecting the seasonal nature of its business it expects to report a loss in the first half.
    Last year the airline reported an interim pretax loss pre-goodwill and non-recurring items of 24 mln stg.
    easyJet shares closed yesterday at 302-1/4, valuing the airline at 1.2 bln stg.

Share prices are expected to open slightly higher but little changed overall, as yesterday's surprise sales warning 
from Nokia prompts caution ahead of the upcoming first quarter earnings season, dealers said.
    The CAC-40 index yesterday closed 35.09 points or 0.93 pct lower at 3,746.11, after a profit warning from Nokia 
and subsequent dip in US stocks took the shine of a market boosted by recent upbeat US data.
    On the Matif, April CAC-40 futures were trading 3 points firmer at 3,752 ahead of the official opening, while the

(Updating to add more detail from TBI statement)
     TBI PLC, the airport operator, said it traded "in line with expectations" in its second half to end-March as low-
cost travel to domestic and European destinations continued to grow.
    The group's four European airports -- London Luton Airport, Belfast International, Cardiff International and 
Stockholm-Skavsta -- handled a total of 2.98 mln passengers during the Jan 1 to March 31 2004 period (TBI's 
fourth quarter), an increase of 13.2 pct over the same period last year.
    For the six months to March, passenger numbers rose 15 pct to 6.1 mln.
    Low-cost traffic continued to drive growth across the portfolio, increasing by 17 pct to 2.5 mln passengers, while 
full service fell 19 pct and charter increased 13 pct.
    The growth in low-cost was principally driven out of Cardiff and Skavsta, which increased passenger numbers by 
28 pct and 215 pct respectively as a result of the growth in operations by bmibaby (Cardiff) and Ryanair Holdings 
PLC (Skavsta).
    During the second half TBI continued to attract additional low-cost traffic.
    In November 2003 Luton became the first destination to be served out of easyJet PLC's new Schonefeld base in 
Berlin, followed in February 2004 by the announcement of a new route to Budapest International in Hungary.
    Also, WIZZ Air will start a new route to Katowice in Poland in May and easyJet will begin services to Dortmund in 
September, both of which will be served out of Luton.
 In March, easyJet announced the further expansion of its operations out of Belfast with the launch of new direct 
scheduled services to key destinations in France and Spain, plus an additional daily London Gatwick service, 
bringing the total destinations served by easyJet from Belfast to 13.
    This came on top of the announcement by Jet2 of two new services to Prague and Brussels.
    At Skavsta, work on the new terminal building has been completed with full commercial operation scheduled to 
begin later this month. In January Ryanair added two new daily routes to Rome and Milan.
    Outside Europe, Orlando Sanford continues to see a recovery in domestic traffic which will be further boosted 
this month when Vacation Express returns its Caribbean hub operations to this airport. Under a seven-year 
agreement, flights will operate three days a week to 11 Caribbean destinations.
    TBI will announce its year to March 31 2004 results on June 10.
TBI says traded 'in line with expectations' in H2 - UPDATE
    Prior to today's statement analysts were forecasting a pretax profit before amortisation of goodwill and 
exceptional items of 22.3-25.0 mln stg versus 23.3 mln stg last time and EPS on the same basis of 2.5-3.0 pence 
versus 2.86 pence.
    Shares in TBI closed Monday at 67 pence, valuing the group at 374 mln stg.

Ryanair Holdings PLC has stopped its London-Brest service because of its "uncertain profitability," said Jean-Luc 
Pelletier, a director with the Brest Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
    The line had been run by Buzz until March 2003 and relaunched by Ryanair the following May. Some 60,000 
passengers used it last year, Pelletier said.

Leading shares are expected to open slightly higher this morning buoyed by Wall Street's positive performance on 
Friday, although trading will be subdued ahead of the long Easter holiday weekend.
    The domestic market is closed on Good Friday and Easter Monday.
    Geopolitical concerns may however take the shine off proceedings after violent clashes in Iraq between coalition 
forces and followers of a radical Shiite leader left at least 30 people dead.
    On Friday, the DJIA ended up 97.26 points at 10,470.59 and the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite rallied 42.16 points 
or 2.1 pct to 2,057.17 after a stronger-than-expected March employment report.
    In Asia, the Nikkei 225 Index closed up 170.87 points at 11,986.82 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was closed for 
a bank holiday.
    The macroeconomic calendar on both sides of the Atlantic is pretty quiet this week, after last week's flurry which 
culminated in the US monthly nonfarm payrolls on Friday.
    The Bank of England's MPC interest rate decision on Thursday heads up the domestic economic calendar, with 
analysts forecasting a rate hike by the closest of margins.
    Seventeen of the 31 forecasters polled by AFX News expect the rate-setting MPC to raise the benchmark repo 
rate to 4.25 pct from 4.00 where it has stood since the last increase in February.
    Even the 14 who believe the BoE will hold its fire rate the chances of a hike this week at a minimum of 40 pct.
    And the only items on today's macroeconomic calendar are UK Feburary industrial production and manfacturing 
output due at 9.30 am BST and ISM non-manufacturing index for March in the US later this afternoon.
 And the corporate calendar looks equally sparse, with no blue-chip or mid-cap companies due to publish earnings 
reports today.
    Airlines will attract attention with BA and Ryanair releasing March traffic statistics.
    The only earnings reports are due from small caps Burren Energy, Havelock Europa and Zi Medical.
    Focus will likely turn to the usual smattering of weekend speculative press reports.
London shares outlook - higher on strong Wall Street
    In M&A action, the Sunday Telegraph reported that GlaxoSmithKline and US peer Pfizer are a group of pharma 
companies lining up initial bids of about 1 bln stg for the consumer health brands division of their Swiss rival Roche 
Holding.
    The auction comes after Roche's chief executive, Franz Humer, admitted earlier this year that the future of the 
consumer division, which had sales of 750 mln stg in 2003, was being reviewed as it was deemed to be too small.
    A spokesman for GSK declined to comment.
    Initial bids for the over-the-counter medicines business, which includes such well-known brands as Rennie 
indigestion tablets and Berocca vitamin supplments, are due before Easter. The portfolio also includes consumer 
health supplements such as Elevit, Redoxon and Supradynbid.
    GSK and Pfizer will face stiff competition from the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group Bayer, which is 
also set to submit an offer for the business.
    And the long-running takeover battle for Canary Wharf could be nearing an end. According to the same paper, 
the UK Takeover Panel is expected to announce this week that it will finally wrap up the long-running bid battle for 
Canary Wharf by imposing a quick-fire auction.
    The novel procedure, which would see rival bidders making new offers within a defined period, has never been 
used in a UK takeover.
    The decision follows a week of intense lobbying by lawyers for both Canary Wharf, which is anxious to see a 
quick resolution, and the rival bidders.
    Meanwhile shareholders in high-street retailer Marks & Spencer may be rattled by reports in the Sunday Times 
and Sunday Telegraph that the group's trading update due next Thursday will show that growth has stalled.
    Fears of further bad news from M&S - one of the worst performing FTSE100 companies last year - increased last 
Monday when the retailer launched a mid-season sale that included discounts of up to 50 pct. And shares in small-
cap Ashtead may come under pressure on a Sunday Telegraph report that the tool and equipment hire company 
dropped PwC as its auditor.
    According to the report, the auditor refused to sign off accounts that were to have formed part of the offer 
document in a 137 mln stg junk bond issue designed to bail out the troubled tool-hire company.
    Ashtead has abandoned the idea of raising the debt in the US because the SEC requires three years of accounts 
to be included in the offer document and last March the company was forced to admit that its US arm had 
overstated profits.
    Elsewhere, the Business reported that Eurotunnel faces a meltdown where creditors seize control of the 
company, if dissident French shareholders succeed in ousting the largely British board of the Channel tunnel 
operator at the AGM this week.
    The report, which does not name its sources, said the rebel shareholders, led by Nicolas Miguet, a French 
investment adviser and would-be right-wing politician, have proposed the motion to sack the board.
    The rebels claim they could do a better job of restructuring the company's huge debt mountain and boosting its 
income than the present board.

the same as March last year, bringing the 12 month figure to 81 pct.
    Internet sales in March totalled 97 pct of all seats sold.
    Last month, Ryanair reported February passenger growth of 45 pct and a load factor of 77 pct.

Body
The shareholders of Hahn airport have agreed to infuse fresh capital totalling 42 mln eur in 2005-2009, partly for 
use in expanding the runway, according to airport operator Flughafen Frankfurt-Hahn GmbH (FFHG).
    It said under a new agreement signed today, the federal state of Hessen will become a shareholder in FFHG 
from next year.
 Currently, Fraport AG holds a 73.07 pct and the state of Rhineland-Palatinate the remainder. From next year, 
Fraport will hold 65 pct stake while Rhineland Palatinate and Hesse each own 17.5 pct.
    Hesse itself will contribute 20 mln eur in the capital infusion while about 22 mln will come from the two other 
shareholders, a spokeswoman said.
    Hahn Airport is located 80 kilometres northwest of Frankfurt and is used as the hub of Ryanair Holdings PLC in 
Germany.
    The spokeswoman said part of the capital injection would be used in expanding the runway, which she said is 
estimated to cost around 42 mln eur.
    Hahn airport is about 100 km away from Frankfurt airport, which is being operated by Fraport.

Wall Street's positive performance overnight is expected to give Europe's leading bourses a moderate boost at the 
opening bell, with the telecom sector in focus ahead of mmO2's trading statement and following France Telecom's 
wide-sweeping structural changes announced earlier, dealers said.
    Trading on Wall Street overnight was a little brighter, with the indexes closing at their best level in three weeks. 
The DJIA rose 52.07 points to 10,381.70 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 8.06 points to 2,000.63 -- its first 
close above 2,000 since March 8.
    In Asia, the Nikkei 225 ended the morning down 18.67 points at 11,675.01 while the Hang Seng had dropped 
27.23 points to 12,614.16 by the end of the morning.
    The OPEC meeting in Vienna today will take the spotlight on the world business stage today, with analysts 
largely predicting the committee will stick to its plan to cut output by 1 mln bpd. The cut was agreed at its last 
meeting in February and is due to come into effect tomorrow.
    The reduction in production is expected to push oil prices even higher than their already historically high levels. 
Average oil prices in the first quarter, which ends today, have been the highest in a first quarter in recorded history.
    On the macroeconomic calendar, investors can expect indicators for euro zone business climate, economic 
sentiment, industrial confidence and consumer confidence for March as well as the euro zone "flash estimate" for 
inflation for March.
    Economists reckon euro zone inflation may have edged up slightly in March from the four-year low of 1.6 pct 
reached in February.
 The data comes just a day ahead of the ECB rate decision and the euro zone manufacturing survey.
    On the other side of the Atlantic, February's factory orders report and March's Chicago purchasing managers' 
index are both due at 4.00 pm BST.
    The Chicago index will be watched closely for hints about the national March ISM number tomorrow. Economists 
expect a dip to 61.5 pct from 63.6 pct.
Euroshares opening - seen buoyed by Wall Street; mmO2, France Telecom in focus
    On the corporate calendar, travel-related stocks will be in focus this morning as both Alitalia and German tour 
operator TUI report earnings and both low-cost airline Ryanair and Air France host separate press briefings in 
Paris.
    TUI is forecast to post full-year earnings before tax and amortisation (EBTA) of 936-953 mln eur, up from 608 mln 
last year, despite an expected drop in sales to 19.1-19.5 bln from 20.3 bln.
    While the divestment of the group's energy operations in 2003 reduced sales, it has boosted profits in what was a 
tough year for Europe's largest tourism company.
    Ryanair's briefing starts at 8.00 am BST and the French flag carrier's conference kicks off at 11.00 am BST.
    A trading statement from mmO2 will also attract attention amid takeover speculation, after Dutch telecom 
incumbent KPN owned up to an aborted offer last month.
    The UK-based mobile operator is expected to paint a rosy picture of its prospects for the coming year, confirming 
it met its targets for the year to end-March. The company has guided UK service revenue growth of over 10 pct for 
the year.
    Elsewhere in the telecom sector, France Telecom will be in focus as investors digest the implications of the 
French telecom incumbent's broad structural and managerial changes announced earlier.
    The company is to split its business into five operational and five performance divisions under an executive 
committee headed by CEO Thierry Breton.
    It also announced that Sol Trujillo is stepping down as CEO of its Orange unit, to be replaced by current chief 
operating officer Sanjiv Ahuja.
    The aim of the restructuring is to provide clients with "a broad and consistent range of communication services, 
independently of the various types of networks (they) use," it said in a statement.

Early signs of airline strength - UPDATE 1
Early signs of airline strength - UPDATE 1

ANNANDALE, Va. For the first time in a long time, an investment adviser with a good record has something positive 
to say about an airline stock.
Over the last six months, of course, the airline sector has been one of the more notable market laggards. The 
AMEX Airline Index   has lost 22 percent since October, in contrast to a more than a 5 percent gain over the same 
period for the Dow Jones Industrials Average   and more than 2 percent for the Nasdaq Composite  .
In large part because of this sector's weakness, furthermore, the Dow Jones Transportation Average   has been 
significantly weaker than the Dow, leading at least one Dow theorist to declare that a bear market signal has been 
triggered (see my ).
The bullish straw in the wind for the airlines was detected by Michael Burke, editor of Investors Intelligence. He 
notes that at least two airline stocks in the past week experienced a technical pattern he refers to as a selling 
climax.
And since all airline stocks are heavily influenced by the same underlying factors -- overall economic strength and 
the price of oil, to name two -- can strength in other airline stocks be far behind?
According to Burke, a selling climax occurs whenever a stock registers a new 52-week low during a given week and 
then closes the subsequent Friday with an overall gain for the week. That low represents the emotional, even panic, 
selling on the part of inexperienced investors. The quick recovery from that low represents the passage of those 
shares from those weaker hands to stronger ones.
A selling climax therefore suggests that a substantial base may be forming on which sizeable gains can be built.
The two airline stocks that experienced a selling climax in the past week are Delta Air Lines   and Ryanair  . In 
Delta's case, the new 52-week low occurred at $7 per share on March 24, only to close the week at $7.67. (It 
gained another 23 cents on Monday.)
In Ryanair's case, the new 52-week low was registered at $30.12 on March 22, followed by a close on Friday of 
$34.14. (This stock lost 16 cents on Monday, to close at $33.98.)
In each case, the gain from the new yearly low to Friday's close was substantial, nearly 10 percent in the case of 
Delta and more than 13 percent in the case of Ryanair.
Early signs of airline strength - UPDATE 1
Making these selling climaxes even more noteworthy is that there have been relatively few of them in recent 
months. In fact, in virtually every week since this stock market rally began a year ago, there have been many times 
more buying climaxes than selling climaxes.
Buying climaxes are the reverse of selling climaxes, and are bearish. Last week, according to Burke's count, there 
were 72 buying climaxes and just 15 selling climaxes.
Among other newsletters on the Hulbert Financial Digest's monitored list, only the Prudent Speculator currently has 
a position in Delta Airlines, pursuant to a purchase executed in December 2001. None has a position in Ryanair.

- Shares of Credit Suisse fell after it admitted to overstating fourth-quarter profit, while European airlines got a lift 
from interest in the sector during U.S. trading Friday.
The Bank of New York European ADR Index slipped 0.39 points to close at 107.56.
Credit Suisse   dipped 86 cents, or 3 percent, to $33.62 after it said that it had made an accounting error in its 
fourth-quarter earnings report that caused it to overstate profits by $156 million. The Swiss bank also said it was 
combining management of its private banking business with its corporate and retail banking business in order to 
strengthen distribution.
Other European banks were also lower. HSBC   was down $1.39 at $73.50 and Lloyds   slipped 35 cents to $30.20.
British Airways   climbed $1.45, or 3 percent, to $51 amid overall gains for stocks in the airline sector in the U.S. 
The company was also helped by a note from Credit Suisse First Boston, which said that the company's "overly 
cautious" outlook appears to be fully priced in to the stock. Elsewhere in the sector, KLM Royal Dutch 
Airlines   tacked on 52 cents, or 3 percent, to $20.07 and Ryanair Holdings   rose 69 cents to $34.14.
Aventis   edged up 22 cents to $74.75 after its CEO met with the French prime minister to discuss the possible 
acquisition of the Franco-German firm by Swiss drugmaker Novartis  .
The French government has indicated that it would oppose the merger, but Aventis has already rejected an earlier 
bid from France's Sanofi-Synthelabo   and the company is hoping that a merger with Novartis can save it from a 
hostile takeover . Shares of Novartis slipped 37 cents to $42.33 and Sanofi shares were down 23 cents at $32.71.

The number of requests being received for aircraft take-off and landing slots in Spain for the summer season is 14 
pct higher than in the year-earlier period, airport authority AENA said.
 In a statement, AENA said the increase in the number of slot requests indicates a total of 1.11 mln aircraft take-offs 
and landings for the summer period, or 133,210 more than a year earlier.
    The largest increases were registered at regional airports like Girona, where they doubled, and Valladolid, up 69 
pct.
    Both Girona and Valladolid are key airports from which low cost carrier Ryanair Holding PLC flies.

Budget carrier Tiger Airways said it expects to take delivery of its first four new Airbus A320s for its fleet in the 
second half of this year.
    It added that the four aircraft will be leased, but did not name the lessor.
 "The Airbus A320 was the clear choice for Tiger's operations and low fare offering. With the new aircraft, we will 
benefit from simplicity in operations, better fuel efficiencies and lower maintenance costs," Tiger chief executive 
Patrick Gan said in a statement.
    "These cost savings will be passed on to our customers. Tiger will offer the lowest possible fares across its 
network," Gan added.
    Tiger, which will be based at Singapore's Changi Airport, also said its application for an Airline Operators 
Certificate (AOC) is currently being processed.
    Tiger Airways, which was formed late last year, counts the Singapore government's investment arm, Temasek 
Holdings among its shareholders, along with Indigo Partners, Irelandia Investments Ltd and Singapore Airlines.
    Irelandia Investments is the private investment arm of the Ryan family, founders of Dublin-based low-cost carrier 
Ryanair.

Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia says open to joint ventures

Malaysian low-fare carrier AirAsia said today it is talking to several airlines, including Australian flag-carrier Qantas, 
for possible joint ventures as part of its regional expansion.
    AirAsia is on the lookout for new ventures after teaming up last month with Shin Corp Plc, the family company of 
Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, in its first overseas foray to launch a Bangkok-based budget carrier, 
executive director Kamarudin Meranun told Agence France-Presse.
    "We are always talking to various people. Qantas is one of them, so long as it makes a lot of sense to do a joint 
venture. We are always open," he said.
    Kamarudin declined to confirm a report in the Australian media that Qantas is considering a tie-up with AirAsia to 
form a Singapore-based, budget airline to service the booming Southeast Asian market.
    Australian reports said Qantas is considering the move as a back-up if regulators blocked a proposed tie-up with 
Air New Zealand.
    AirAsia has applied for an air operator's license from the Singapore government to operate from the city-state, 
but this has yet to be approved.
    Two Singapore-based no-frills airlines are expected to take off this year -- Singapore Airlines-backed Tiger 
Airways and ValuAir.
    AirAsia was expected to unveil details later today on its planned initial public offering to finance its expansion 
plans, but Kamarudin said the company is still evaluating proposals and will make an announcement at the 
"appropriate time."
    Local reports said the profit-making carrier will appoint a local and a foreign bank for the share offer expected to 
be launched in September.
 AirAsia, Southeast Asia's most successful budget carrier so far, plans to increase its fleet to 30 aircraft from 14 
now as it flies to more destinations.
    Reports have said it will invest 228 mln rgt on its fleet expansion.
    The two-year-old Malaysian company, dubbed Southeast Asia's version of European budget carrier Ryanair, 
already flies to Singapore, Thailand and will spread its wings to Indonesia in April.

Irish trade union SIPTU has backed down from plans to hold a strike at Dublin airport on Thursday, said Ryanair 
Holdings PLC, the airport's biggest customer.
    The move came ahead of a High Court hearing in Dublin of an application from the no-frills airline to block the 
strike and followed the involvement of the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern.
 The airline had gone to court because this week is one of the busiest of the year, with the St Patrick's Day 
celebrations, thousands of Irish people visiting the Cheltenham horse racing festival, and the European Presidency 
meeting in Dublin.
    SIPTU is protesting against plans to break up Aer Rianta, the state company responsible for running Ireland's 
three main airports -- Dublin, Shannon and Cork.
    "By SIPTU's last minute backing down this morning, the travel plans of over 50,000 people have been saved," 
said a Ryanair spokesman.
    "It is bizarre that Ryanair, a customer of the airport, has taken this court action to prevent the closure of the 
airport while the airport owner/operators Aer Rianta have done nothing and have no contingency plans in place to 
deal with these threatened closures."
    He called on the government to immediately proceed with independent competing terminals at Dublin airport "to 
avoid the country being held to ransom again."
    At 1.55 pm shares in Ryanair were down 0.07 eur at 4.54 eur.

Singapore's upcoming low-fare airline Tiger Airways has applied for an operating license, company officials said 
today amid media reports that it will also go head-to-head with major carriers.
    Tiger Airways will fly to destinations up to five hours from Singapore and is "possibly looking at the big cities and 
leisure points as well," the Straits Times quoted the airline's adviser, Charlie Clifton, as saying.
 However, a spokesperson from the airline told Agence France-Presse it is not ready to disclose specific 
destinations yet.
    The Singapore Government is already laying out plans to accommodate the operations and possible expansion 
of low-cost carriers (LCCs), such as Tiger Airways.
    A terminal specifically tailored to meet the needs of budget airlines will be added to Singapore's Changi Airport, 
Transport Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said in parliament yesterday.
    "This way, we will ensure that we are well prepared should the LCCs take off in a big way in Asia," he said.
    Tiger Airways filed its license application with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore.
    The airline, jointly owned by Singapore Airlines, the founders of European no-frills carrier Ryan Air, state-owned 
investment agency Temasek Holdings and American investors Indigo Partners, said it expects to start flights in the 
fourth quarter of this year.
    It will face competition from a number of Southeast Asia-based budget airlines, such as market leader AirAsia of 
Malaysia, as well as upcoming carriers ValuAir from Singapore and Nok Air from Thailand.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, the no-frills airline, said it plans to relocate the majority of its operations from Birmingham 
Airport to Nottingham East Midlands International Airport in response to Birmingham's decision to raise runway 
charges by 100 pct.
    With effect from April 29 the airline will transfer 70 pct of its Birmingham operations to Nottingham.
 Services to be relocated include three daily Dublin flights and daily flights to Barcelona Girona and Murcia.
    Birmingham will for the moment retain two daily flights to Dublin.
    "This reduction in operations is bad news for Birmingham but great news for Nottingham East Midlands 
International Airport," said Michael Cawley, Ryanair's deputy chief executive.
    "By increasing its cost by 100 pct Birmingham is denying its passengers the opportunity to take advantage of 
Ryanair's low fares."
    Birmingham Airport is owned by Australian firm Macquarie Airports Ltd, while Nottingham East Midlands is 
owned by Manchester Airport.
    At 12.37 pm shares in Ryanair were down 0.9 eur at 4.52.

Share prices closed lower on featureless trading which saw Fisher and Paykel Appliances reach a new high, 
dealers said.
    The key NZSX-50 index was down 10.37 points or 0.41 pct at 2504.21 on turnover of just 75.7 mln nzd.
 "In general, the market was a bit soft, volumes were light -- a reasonably typical Monday with Fisher and Paykel 
Appliances standing out as bucking the trend," said UBS Warburg's Richard Leggat.
    Fisher and Paykel Appliances stretched another 0.13 nzd up to a new high of 4.53 with investors welcoming a 
profit upgrade by the white goods company.
    They said investors were keen on buying the stock before it goes ex-dividend next week.
    The stock has risen 19 pct since announcing the sale of the stake in conjunction with the profit upgrade earlier 
this month. It is up 90 pct on a year ago.
    One stock to have even outperformed Appliances this year, Mooring Systems, added another 0.45 to 3.35. The 
US Navy announced it was considering using its system for linking up ships at sea.
    The hardest hit stock today was Infratil which took a 0.10 nzd tumble to 2.60 after it announced its 77 pct owned 
subsidiary, Glasgow Prestwick International Airport, would be "materially below expectations".
    It said profit at the Ryanair airport would fall 10 pct.
    Market leader Telecom, which finished last week on a 34-month high, fell back 0.03 to 5.87.
    Fishing company Sanford, mulling a merger with privately held Sealord because of problems in the industry, fell 
0.30 to 4.80 on low turnover.

U.S.-listed shares of European stocks turned south along with major domestic indexes Thursday after deadly 
bombings in Madrid spurred terror concerns.
The Bank of New York European ADR Index fell 2.34 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 109.9. The Nasdaq 
Composite ended the day down 20 points, or 1 percent, at 1,944. . 
The sell-off gathered momentum ahead of the bell after reports in an Arabic newspaper tied the terrorist attacks to 
al-Qaida. The blasts in Spain killed at least 190 people and wounded 1,200 others.
Spain's busiest issue Banco Santander  , which is based in Madrid, lost 31 cents, or 2.8 percent, to close at $10.90.
Airline stocks sold off across the board with British Airways   leading the way, down $4.41, or 8 percent, at $50.95.
KLM Royal Dutch   and Ryanair   fell 3.4 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively.
Once again, shares of Senetek   were the group's most active, but that's where the similarities to Wednesday's 
session end. The small biopharmaceutical firm announced "uniformly positive" results of a study on its Zeatin skin 
product Wednesday, triggering a 127 percent surge on volume of almost 75 million shares. .
The stock ended up giving back 22 percent of its value to close at 79 cents on nearly 15 million shares changing 
hands Thursday.
Another leading percentage decliner, Royal & Sun Alliance shares   plummeted $1.44, or 15 percent, to finish at 
$8.11, after the British insurer's operating profits missed Wall Street forecasts. The company also bolstered 
reserves against claims. 
Nokia   trailed only slightly in terms of volume, ending down 65 cents, or 3 percent, at $21.12 while cell phone rival 
Ericsson   fell even further, off $1.73, or 6.1 percent, to close at $26.58.
Performances were only slightly better on the oil front where Royal Dutch   lost $1.15, or 2.3 percent, to end at 
$48.62. BP   shed 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $48.81.

(Updating with other details, background)
     Budget carrier AirAsia Sdn Bhd, which is going ahead with its initial public offering (IPO) in September, will 
invest 228 mln rgt to increase its fleet to 30 before year's end from 14 now, The Financial Daily reported.
    It quoted AirAsia chief executive officer Tony Fernandes as saying the company has identified one local and one 
foreign bank for its listing exercise and that it will make an announcement on the IPO next week.
    "Some negotiations (are) taking place and we will make an announcement next Friday," Tony Fernandes, 
AirAsia's chief executive officer told Agence France-Presse.
    Fernandes said the announcement will be related to identifying the banks to underwrite the IPO and the timing of 
the issue.
    The banks are likely to be Commerce International Merchant Bankers Bhd and Credit Suisse First Boston, an 
analyst close to the deal said.
    Asked about the valuation of the IPO, he said: "We will look at it at a later stage."
    An analyst with a local brokerage said AirAsia's rapid expansion to regional destinations is turning up the heat on 
larger carriers.
    "It is obvious, they are turning up the heat," he told AFP on condition of anonymity.
    The analyst said it is vital AirAsia expands quickly to enjoy the economics of scale and boost revenue.
    "If it don't, it may have difficulties paying off its debts," he said.
    The analyst said, since AirAsia has a healthy cash flow, the IPO will enjoy a favorable response.
 "It is clear, the IPO is to help the carrier fund its capital expenditure -- fleet expansion," he said. "It is fast and 
cheapest way to raise funds."
    Fernandes attributed the company's run-away success to good staff, hard work and costing.
    The two-year-old Malaysian company has become Southeast Asia's version of European budget carrier Ryanair.
    From its humble beginning with just two Boeing 737-300 jets in 2001 plying Malaysia's domestic routes, AirAsia 
has expanded at a furious pace under the helm of Fernandes, an accountant by training, who previously had no 
experience in running an airline.
Malaysia's AirAsia to invest 228 mln rgt to increase fleet size to 30 - UPDATE
    It already flies to Singapore, Thailand and will spread its wings to Indonesia next month.
    AirAsia will commence daily flights from Kuala Lumpur to Bandung on April 12, to Surabaya on April 15 and from 
southern Johor state and neighboring Singapore to Jakarta on April 10.
    With ticket prices as low as 23 usd, Fernandes said the airline targets a load factor of 70 pct at least.
    Besides the three destinations, the airline also plans to fly to Denpasar, Bali from Kuala Lumpur this year.
    On Thailand, Fernandes said the carrier has enjoyed a load factor of 85 pct since it was launched last month.

Formula One Minardi team boss Paul Stoddart said he hopes to have a new budget airline called OzJet flying 
Australia's east coast by Christmas.
    Stoddart was confident his planned airline would survive in the increasingly competitive Australian market.
 "We'll start off with about half a dozen aircraft, probably launching in about October," he told Channel Ten 
yesterday. "We're hoping to get in just before Christmas."
    OzJet will face stiff competition as a price war has already broken out in the Australian market between Virgin 
Blue, launched by British tycoon Richard Branson in 2000, and flag carrier Qantas' budget offshoot Jetstar, due to 
launch in May.
    Stoddard said his planned airline would fly to major cities on the east coast, using secondary suburban airports 
rather than the large international airports favoured by most competitors.
    "We are trying to serve a different niche market and I think it will work really well," Stoddart said.
    He will present his plans to officials in New South Wales and Victoria states this week.
    Stoddard, who bought Italian-based racing team Minardi in 2001 and lives in England, built his fortune in the 
airline industry with the European Air Charter Company.
    He said OzJet would be based on European cut-price success stories Eurojet and Ryanair.

(Updating to add more detail from easyJet statement, background)
     easyJet PLC, the Luton-based no-frills airline, said it carried 1.86 mln passengers in February, a rise of 17.4 pct 
on the same month last year.
    Load factor -- the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available -- was maintained at 89 
pct.
 The figures contrast with those issued by rival Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday.
    The Dublin based carrier reported a 4 pct slip in its February load factor to 77 pct as it struggles to fill the extra 
capacity it has added.
    "These figures confirm our comments at our recent AGM regarding both the
performance of the company and the outlook," said chief executive Ray Webster.
    At the Feb 26 meeting easyJet said it was "cautiously optimistic" regarding its performance for the year to end-
Sept 2004. For the year it expects slightly improved load factors and a similar yield.
    It said load factors and yields for the first half to end-March were anticipated to be above last year. But, reflecting 
the seasonal nature of its business it expects to report a loss in the first half.
    easyJet shares closed yesterday at 334-1/4, valuing the airline at 1.3 bln stg.

Singapore's low-fare airline Tiger Airways has hit a legal snag over its name, months before its planned takeoff later 
this year, a spokesman for the company said.
    A small British company with the same name offering flying lessons in vintage bi-planes is laying claim to the 
Tiger Airways name.
 "Our lawyers are in discussions with them," a spokesman for the Singapore-based Tiger Airways told Agence 
France Presse. "We are cooperating with them. They had been in contact with us."
    The company based in Gloucestershire, England, said on its website, www.tigerairways.co.uk, that it takes its 
name from the Tiger Moth, which it describes as probably the best known of all the 1930s vintage bi-planes.
    Singapore's Tiger Airways, owned by Singapore Airlines and the founders of European no-frills carrier Ryanair, 
said last week it expects to start flights in the fourth quarter of this year.
    Its other owners are the government's investment vehicle, Temasek Holdings, and American investors Indigo 
Partners.
    Tiger Airways will compete with a growing number of Southeast Asia-based budget carriers, including market 
leader Malaysia-based AirAsia and upcoming rivals ValuAir of Singapore and Nok Air of Thailand.

    The closure of the service is in response to the recent ruling by the European Commission that part of the 
subsidies the low-cost carrier received from Belgium's Walloon regional government, which owns Charleroi airport, 
were illegal.
 Ryanair warned that it will carry out more flight reductions and route closures at Charleroi unless forthcoming talks 
with Charleroi Airport and the Walloon authorities result in a new agreement with a similar low cost base as before.
    Ryanair said the termination of the Charleroi-London route, which operates up to eight daily flights and carries 
over 360,000 passengers annually, will represent a 10 pct reduction in daily flights from the Belgian airport.
    Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said: "These capacity reductions are bad news for customers at 
Brussels Charleroi, but good news for other lower cost airports. As the Brussels-London route had the lowest fares, 
this route cannot be sustained if costs are to be increased as a result of the Commission's decision to increase 
ticket prices by 6 eur to 8 eur per ticket.
    "These flights will now operate on lower cost routes between private airports such as London Stansted, Glasgow 
Prestwick, Stockholm Skavsta and London Luton."
    Ryanair is appealing the EU decision to the European Court in Luxembourg.

(Updating with other details)
     Budget carrier Tiger Airways said it has appointed William Franke, one of its shareholders, its chairman and 
Singaporean Patrick Gan chief executive officer.
    Franke is managing partner and co-founder of Indigo Partners, a US-based investment firm, while Gan has spent 
18 years in the pharmaceutical industry.
 The shareholders of Tiger Airways, formed late last year, are Singapore Government investment arm Temasek 
Holdings, Indigo Partners, Irelandia Investments Ltd and Singapore Airlines.
    Irelandia Investments is the private investment arm of the Ryan family, founders of Dublin-based low-cost carrier 
Rynair.
    Franke said the airline expects to start operations either late in the third quarter or early in fourth of this year, 
depending on the approval of its Airline Operators' Certificate (AOC).
    He said Tiger Airways is likely to announce a decision on its fleet type and size soon and named Boeing 737 and 
Airbus A320 as possible aircraft for the airline.
    Tiger Airways is likely to start flying with five or six aircraft, he added, but declined to comment on possible 
destinations in Southeast Asia.
    Gan said the airline plans to employ 35 pilots and 40 cabin crew, but has not done any hiring as yet.
    When asked how much cheaper Tiger Airway's tickets will be, compared to Valuair, Franke said, "Hopefully, we'll 
do better (lower) than Valuair."
    Valuair said yesterday that its tickets are likely to be 40-50 pct cheaper than those of a full-service airline.

Officials at Charleroi Airport south of Brussels said they are hoping to change Ryanair Holdings PLC's mind about 
closing the London-Charleroi route in response to a European Commission subsidy ruling.
    Airport spokesman Pierre Fernemont said the airport hopes to "discuss calmly" and "as soon as possible" with 
Ryanair "to see if nothing can be done" to persuade the Irish low-cost carrier to stay.
 He said officials are hoping to get Ryanair to reconsider its decision or "create other routes with higher added value 
than London" from Charleroi.
    The European Commission early this month ruled that part of the subsidies received be Ryanair from the 
Walloon regional government, Charleroi Airport's owners, were illegal and had to be repaid.

ROUNDUP - Qantas budget carrier launches price war against Virgin Blue
ROUNDUP - Qantas budget carrier launches price war against Virgin Blue

A price war broke out in the cut-throat Australian domestic aviation market when Qantas Airways Ltd unveiled rock-
bottom fares on its budget offshoot Jetstar designed to put the squeeze on upstart Virgin Blue.
    In its long-awaited response to Virgin Blue's 34 pct share of its home market, Jetstar offered 100,000 introductory 
tickets at 29 aud.
    Virgin Blue immediately offered 200,000 tickets at the same price, saying: "We'll match them and raise them.
    "We will not be underpriced or out-stunted," Virgin Blue chief executive Brett Godfrey said.
    After bouncing back from SARS and the Iraq war to post a record interim profit last week, Qantas turned its 
attention to Virgin Blue, which has been been encroaching in its domestic market since it was launched by British 
tycoon Richard Branson in mid-2000.
    Qantas Airways chief executive Geoff Dixon said Jetstar would make its maiden flight on May 25, operating from 
Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney to 10 tourist destinations in eastern Australia, including Cairns and the Gold 
Coast.
    Dixon said he expected a response from Virgin Blue but downplayed the prospect of a price war.
    "We'll go very, very hard at each other and I believe mainly on product and capacity and on innovation," he told 
reporters.
    Shaw Stockbroking aviation analyst Brent Mitchell said the discounts were more extensive than the market had 
expected and could end up eroding the profitability of both airlines.
    "There will be a price war, we can safely say that looking at these fares," he said.
"How damaging it will be will depend on the extent and duration of discounting.
    "Qantas is absorbing some of the cost of Jetstar trying to put financial pressure on Virgin Blue -- it will take some 
profitability out of the entire equation."
    Ian Thomas, senior consultant at the Centre for Asia-Pacific Aviation, noted the cut price fares were lower than 
those being offered at the height of Australia's last price war in 2000, which resulted in domestic carrier Ansett 
folding and rival Impulse being swallowed by Qantas.
    "It's a very aggressive strategy from Qantas, which isn't surprising and there will clearly be a response from 
Virgin Blue," he said. "We're looking at a tit-for-tat price war."
ROUNDUP - Qantas budget carrier launches price war against Virgin Blue
    Led by a core of executives poached from Ireland's Ryanair, one of the pioneers of the low-fare industry, Jetstar 
will operate as an independent business unit with headquarters at Avalon airport, about 55 kilometers from central 
Melbourne.
    The airline will initially use 14 Boeing 717 aircraft but has ordered a fleet of 23 Airbus A320's, which will begin 
arriving this June and be fully operational by mid-2006.
    It will expand from Australia's east coast in November this year to include destinations such as Perth and Ayers 
Rock.
    Jetstar has secured important concessions from air industry unions that have cut costs by up to 30 pct compared 
to Qantas rates and made it competitive with Virgin Blue.
    Dixon said earlier this month that he expected Jetstar to have a third of the domestic market by the end of its first 
year.
    Virgin Blue, however, signalled it was not prepared to give up the market share that has generated strong profits 
and made it a sharemarket success, with Godfrey vowing to give seats away free rather than be undercut by 
Jetstar.
    Qantas shares closed down 0.04 aud at 3.73, while Virgin Blue was off 0.02 at 2.59.

Boeing Co said it expects to deliver 285 commercial aircraft in 2004, slightly higher than the 281 in 2003, with Asian 
airlines accounting for about a third of the sales.
    "We're expecting to deliver 285 commercial aircraft this year.
We're projecting Asia to represent one-third of all aircraft sold," Randolph Baseler, vice-president of marketing for 
the Boeing Commercial Airplanes Group, said on the sidelines of a media briefing at the Asian Aerospace event 
here.
    However, Boeing said it will not be announcing any new orders at the event, although it is in currently in talks with 
all the major Asian airlines.
    Last month, the company delivered 20 aircraft, 16 of which were single aisle Boeing 737s especially popular with 
low-cost carriers.
    Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, had taken delivery of three of the 16 Boeing 737s sold this year, the 
company said.
    However, the future growth of air travel will almost entirely be taken up by aircraft that offer long-range, point-to-
point services, Baseler said.
    "Air travel is projected to grow 5 pct per annum. We expect almost all the increase in air travel to be taken up by 
non-stop, high-frequency flights," he said, adding that all of Boeing's new commercial aircraft projects are based on 
this philosophy.

European discount airline EasyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou's new company, EasyTelecom, an internet-based 
cellphone operator, will start to offer discount mobile service in Britain some time this year, with plans to expand to 
the rest of Europe, International Herald Tribune reported.
    "Mobile phone tariffs are too complicated and the service too costly.
It is time somebody undercut them," Haji-Ioannou said.
    Virgin Mobile, part of the Virgin Group, which owns part of Virgin Air, offers low-rate mobile phone service in 
Britain and is looking to expand onto the continent. And on March 1, Ryanair Telecom, the telecommunications 
spinoff of Ryanair, EasyJet's main discount airline competitor in Europe, plans to introduce a similar mobile service.
    The low-cost providers entering the market are known as mobile virtual network operators, who buy capacity 
from existing operators and use the internet as their sole distribution and sales channel, allowing them to avoid the 
huge costs connected with running a network.
    This allows virtual operators to deliver voice calls and short messaging at very cheap rates, without subscription 
plans. Typically, they charge a single rate for calls made anywhere in a national territory and a single rate for 
messages.

Ryanair Holdings PLC may close Buzz, the airline it bought a year ago from the Dutch carrier KLM, after it failed in 
a legal action to reduce the high cost of its aircraft leases, The Sunday Times reported citing Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary.
    Buzz, which operates six aircraft from Stansted airport, took legal action in Dublin last week against America's 
International Lease Finance Corp (ILFC).
 Although the companies have not divulged any details of the suit, it is understood that Buzz lost in an attempt to 
reduce the lease fees it pays on its Boeing 737 aircraft. It is expected to return to court with a separate claim 
against ILFC next week.
    Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said that if Buzz was unable to reduce the cost of its aircraft leases it 
would have to return the aircraft to the lessor. "If that happened it will have to cease trading," O'Leary is reported as 
saying.
    Ryanair bought Buzz from KLM in February last year, paying 13.5 mln stg for an operation that was losing about 
3 mln stg a month.

Eurostar is starting to win the battle against cheap air fares with figures for January -- due later this week -- 
expected to confirm that the service has finally turned the corner, according to The Business.
    The newspaper did not name its source, but said the figures for January will be a record and show that Eurostar 
is starting to see off competition from Ryanair Holdings PLC and British Airways PLC.
 Last year's opening of the first stage of the high-speed Channel Tunnel Rail Link in the UK also allowed the service 
to slash journey times and increase punctuality.
    The January figures are expected to show that Eurostar's share of the market will be substantially up on a year-
on-year basis. BA is expected to have lost out on the London to Paris route, while Ryanair's market share will have 
been squeezed on the London to Brussels route, according to the article.

(Updating to recast, add comments from Stelios Haji-Ioannou)
     Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder and former chairman of easyJet PLC, yesterday sold a further 4 mln shares or 1 
pct of the Luton-based no-frills airline to finance "a little shopping spree".
    easyJet said the disposal by Haji-Ioannou's easyGroup Holdings Ltd vehicle took his stake down to 66.1 mln or 
16.57 pct, netting him around 14.2 mln stg.
His brother Polys and sister Clelia hold a further 24 pct.
    In a statement on his website Haji-Ioannou explained that in the last few days he has made firm commitments to 
buy a cruise ship capable of carrying 250 people for his easyCruise business, a 25 room hotel in London SW7 for 
easyHotel and a fleet of buses from Mercedes for easyBus.
    "So I thought it was prudent to rebalance my portfolio a little bit by converting some easyJet stock into cash," he 
said.
    "As I have always said, I will continue to do that from time to time at irregular intervals."
    Haji-Ioannou is also evaluating more brand extensions in areas as diverse as pizza delivery, music downloads 
and telecoms.
    He insisted his disposal should not be seen as a lack of confidence in easyJet.
    "I remain a great believer in the scalability and sustainability of the business model I developed," he said.
    "The recent EC ruling has exposed the opportunistic nature of the business model pursued by Michael O'Leary at 
Ryanair. I think easyJet will be the clear winner in European aviation."
    At 11.01 am shares in easyJet were down 8 pence, or 2 pct, at 353-1/2, valuing the airline at 1.39 bln stg.

BANGKOK (AFP-ASIA) - Budget airline AirAsia launched its Bangkok-Singapore route, with passengers vowing to 
regularly use the no-frills service over premium carriers despite having to pay for water.
    The pioneering Malaysian airline beat a growing number of budget carriers, including one being jointly set up by 
Singapore Airlines, in becoming the first to offer ultra-cheap fares on the potentially lucrative route.
    Passengers on the return leg from Singapore to Bangkok told an Agence France-Presse correspondent, who 
was on board the flight courtesy of AirAsia, they paid 80 sgd for one-way tickets.
    This compared with prices quoted by a Singapore travel agent of between 250 and 350 sgd with Singapore 
Airlines and Thai Airways for a one-way ticket on the same route.
    One of the passengers on board the Boeing 747-300, Singaporean businessman Ronald Chen, said he is 
impressed with AirAsia's service despite having to pay for water and snacks that normally come free on more 
expensive airlines.
    "The price makes traveling more accessible to everybody for holidays. It will encourage young people like myself 
to travel," Chen, 29, said.
    British tourist Alex Alden, 25, said he is happy to give up services normally seen as routine on premium carriers 
to get a cheaper ticket.
    "The flight was good, very good. I don't care about any pampering. It's a short-haul flight," he said.
    AirAsia chief executive Tony Fernandes said he was happy with the first day of flying between Bangkok and 
Singapore, although he was slightly disappointed with the 45-minute turnaround at Changi airport.
 Fernandes was forced to use Changi after the Singapore government rejected his application to use the city-state's 
secondary Seletar airport, which he believed would have enabled him quicker turnarounds and flow-on cost 
savings.
    AirAsia began in 2001 serving solely the Malaysian market but has rapidly expanded regionally over recent 
months with intra-Thailand flights as well as the Singapore-Bangkok route.
    Industry analysts said at an aviation seminar in Singapore last week that low-cost airlines would prove as popular 
in Asia as they have done in Europe, where carriers such as RyanAir offer flights for far less than train tickets.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's biggest budget airline, has ordered "stripped-down" planes to further drive down 
costs, the Sunday Times newspaper reported, quoting the airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary.
    It will be removing what it considers to be "non-essentials" like reclining seats, window blinds, head rests, and 
seat pockets.
 Later on, passengers will also be told to bring less luggage so the airline will no longer have to store it in the hold.
    "Think about it. People are happy to carry a bag onto buses so why not onto airlines? This could be 
revolutionary," said O'Leary, who is ordering the changes to a fleet of aircraft from Boeing.
    Replacing reclining seats with non-adjustable ones will save the airline more than 1.3 mln stg, while removing 
window blinds could generate savings of about 130,000 stg for each plane.
    Ditching seat pockets will reduce cleaning costs, while removing the Velcro headrest could save the company a 
further 100,000 stg, the newspaper said.

(Updating to add comment from spokesman on how damages may be sought)
     Virgin Express Holding NV said it is considering seeking compensation for the damage it suffered to its business 
as a result of illegal subsidies granted to its rival Ryanair Holdings PLC.
    Last week, the European Commission ordered Ryanair to pay back subsidies amounting to around 4 mln eur 
which it received from the state-owned Charleroi airport in the south of Belgium where the company has its 
continental hub.
 Virgin Express, which operates from Brussels National airport, said it has been "damaged by this illegal activity" 
and is examining all of its legal options.
    It said that once the full report by the commission is published, it will "decide whether we are going to seek 
compensation for damages incurred during the period that the illegal subsidies were offered to Ryanair".
    Virgin Express added: "We certainly do not accept that ignorance of the rules is a convincing defence."
    Asked from whom the company will seek compensation, spokesman Yves Panneels said Virgin Express lawyers 
will look at the report and "then define our position" further.
    The company declined to say the magnitude of damages that it might be able to claim as a result of the illegal 
subsidies.

    Overnight on Wall Street, the DJIA closed 24.81 points higher at 10,495.55, while the Nasdaq ended 5.42 points 
firmer at 2,019.56 helped by fairly bullish comments from a Federal Reserve governor.
    The mood was mixed today in Asia, with the Nikkei 225 index closing 3.68 points easier at 10,460.92 ahead of 
the start of the latest G7 meeting; while the Hang Seng ended its morning session 234.79 points firmer at 13,265.73 
as bird flu worries eased.
    Live chicken sales to Hong Kong's markets resumed today a week after a ban as part of measures to prevent 
bird flu entering the city.
    The main focus today will undoubtedly be the latest US jobs report, with the market likely to be cautious ahead of 
this always volatile data release.
    US non-farm payrolls in January are expected to have risen by 154,000 after a disappointing gain of just 1,000 in 
December.
    But the US jobless rate is expected to remain unchanged on the month at 5.7 pct for January, with average 
hourly wages also set to hold steady month-on-month at 0.2 pct.
 Traders are also expected to be a touch nervous ahead of the start of the first G7 meeting of 2004, taking place in 
Boca Raton, Florida
    Meanwhile, after yesterday's as-expected quarter point hike in UK interest rates, there will be little domestic data 
to back up the Bank of England's decision today, with the only scheduled release being the UK Company 
Insolvencies report for the fourth quarter.
    It will be a similar story on the corporate front, with the only event scheduled today the release of January traffic 
figures from low-cost airline easyJet.
London shares outlook - Touch firmer on New York gains ahead of US jobs data
    The discount carrier is expected to continue to show good traffic growth, but the recent travails of its Irish-based 
peer Ryanair could have an underlying impact on sentiment for the group.
    On Tuesday easyJet welcomed the European Commission ruling that some of the aid Ryanair receives from 
Belgium's Wallonia regional government for use of Brussels' Charleroi airport is illegal and should be repaid.
    Ray Webster, easyJet chief executive, said then that the ruling was good news for Europe's airlines "as it 
removes a very substantial degree of uncertainty that has been hanging over European aviation for some time."
    Elsewhere, telecom issues should be in focus today after Swedish telecom equipment group Ericsson posted 
much better than expected results this morning.
    Ericsson reported an adjusted fourth quarter profit after financials of 5.50 bln skr, well above average market 
expectations of 2.414 bln skr.
    Retailer New Look could be active as well after the Financial Times reported that the group is close to agreeing a 
recommended cash bid that would allow Tom Singh, founder of the budget fashion retailer, to take the group private 
for a price of 348 pence per share.
    And among the small cap, Clubhaus should be in focus after the Daily Telegraph reported that Legal & General's 
private equity wing, has emerged as the frontrunner to buy the debt-laden golf course operator
    The Telegraph says L&G, which is backing a management buyout by Charlie Parker, the company's managing 
director and founder, has bid 56-57 mln stg for Clubhaus, which warned on Monday that any takeover would be well 
below the then prevailing share price.

Belgium's Walloon regional government said two other low-cost airlines -- one Polish and one Italian -- will join 
Ryanair Holdings PLC in operating at Charleroi airport, outside Brussels.
    The region's economics minister, Serge Kubla, made the announcement in an invitation to a news conference, 
but did not identify the airlines.
    Ryanair, which was told by the European Commission on Tuesday to repay some of its state aid received from 
the Walloon government, is the dominant airline at Charleroi.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based no-frills airline that was yesterday ordered by the European Commission 
to repay around 4 mln eur in Belgian state subsidies, was today wrapped by the advertising watchdog for making 
misleading claims and using offensive language.
    The Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints from rival carrier easyJet PLC and six members of the 
public who objected to two national press advertisements which claimed Ryanair has "the lowest fares, the fewest 
cancellations, the best punctuality" and which called on travellers to fly with the airline if they want to avoid "delayed 
flights, cancelled flights".
 The ASA told Ryanair to remove the claims, criticising the data the airline provided in support of them.
    The watchdog also upheld complaints from 47 members of the public to an advert that appeared in the Daily 
Telegraph in the run-up to Nov 5 last year  headlined "Fawking Great Offers!" and surrounded by illustrations of 
fireworks.
    The ASA concluded the advert was likely to cause widespread offence to readers of the Daily Telegraph and told 
Ryanair not to repeat the approach.
    The ASA advised Ryanair to contact the Committee of Advertising Practice before advertising again.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is likely to be a number of months before it can assess the impact of the European 
Commission's decision on its cost base at Charleroi.
    The European Commission ruled yesterday that 25-30 pct of the 15 mln eur Ryanair received from from 
Belgium's Wallonia regional government, which owns Charleroi airport, was illegal.
 Ryanair expects the European Commission's report on the Brussels-Charleroi cost base will be published in a 
number of weeks. Thereafter, the government of Belgium will have 60 days to respond to it with its proposals for 
compliance with the decision.
    In the meantime, Ryanair said this decision will be appealed to the European Court of Justice and the company is 
confident of overturning the decision on appeal.

The Irish Stock Exchange is to investigate the sale of 44 mln eur (30 mln stg) of Ryanair PLC shares by members 
of the founding family just two weeks before the airline's dramatic profits warning last week, according to The Daily 
Telegraph.
    Citing Dublin-based sources, the newspaper said Shane and Cathal Ryan, two of the three sons of Tony Ryan, 
the airline's founder, sold 6.4 mln shares at 6.9 eur each on Jan 14.
 Neither are on the Ryanair board, though their father remains a non-executive director. Cathal is a former non-
executive. The sale, through the airline's house broker Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin, took place two weeks before 
last Wednesday's warning, which knocked almost a third off the share price, the newspaper said.
    A spokesman for the Ryan family said the members of the family who sold shares are not associated with the 
company. "They were not in receipt of any information. The sale of that stock was in negotiation for a number of 
months," the spokesman is quoted as saying.
    Asked about an Irish Stock Exchange inquiry, she said it was "not unusual" in a profits warning situation that the 
Stock Exchange will look at all recent dealings but there was no special investigation into this one.
    Sources in Dublin said the deal would be scrutinised by the exchange, though that does not imply any 
wrongdoing.

Ryanair Holdings PLC's head of regulatory affairs, Jim Callaghan, said the airline will take a decision on cutting its 
routes out of Brussels' Charleroi airport in "a matter of weeks".
    Callaghan also said Ryanair's appeal of the European Commission's state aid decision will take two to three 
years.
 The commission ruled today that some of the aid the airline receives from Belgium's Wallonia regional government 
is illegal and should be repaid.
    Asked if the airline hoped to obtain a stay on the commission's decision pending the outcome of its appeal, 
Callaghan said this usually occurred when a company was in a very bad financial state.
    "We'll go through the motions and make a request," he said.
    Callaghan said the EU's private market investor principle "is really the core of the appeal".
    This principle is intended to ensure equal treatment between public-sector operators and private firms.
    "We have an incredibly strong case on the market investor principle,"    Callaghan said.
    He said Charleroi airport had shown the commission its business plan, what other airports were offering, and how 
the contract with Ryanair would translate into profit.
    He said it was "not a sweetheart deal".

(Updates with comments by EU's De Palacio)
     The European Commission said Ryanair Holdings PLC must  repay at least 4 mln eur of the subsidies it 
received from Belgium's Wallonia regional government, which owns Charleroi airport, over 2001-2003.
    The commission said it authorises certain forms of aid which permit genuine development of new routes under 
clearly defined conditions.
    It said however that other direct aid "is incompatible with the proper functioning of the internal market and will 
have to be repaid".
    EU transport commissioner Loyola De Palacio said 70-75 pct of the total 15 mln eur of state aid granted to the 
airline "is authorised" under EU rules.
    The rest is illegal, De Palacio said, adding that she does not yet have exact figures.
    "Whether it is 3 or 4 mln that has to be paid back, I am not going to tell you," she said.
    She said the aid not allowed includes the discounts on airport charges granted at Charleroi which go beyond 
those already seen in Belgian legislation, the reduced ground handling fees, one-shot incentives paid when new 
routes were launched, and the assistance provided for the Dublin-Charleroi route.
    De Palacio said that the end of the subsidies will mean an average increase of 6-8 eur per return airfare, 
although it is up to Ryanair whether it passes this on.
    She said the commission is "clearly supporting regional airports and low-cost airlines, we are just obliging them 
to be more transparent and operate on a fair basis".
 Asked about Ryanair's claim that the consumer will lose out, she said:
"I feel that there has been a clear lack of transparency and not all the carriers have been given the same treatment. 
Of course, the airline has been of benefit to consumers, but any carrier, BA, Air France, whichever, if they were 
given aid, they would be in a position to reduce their prices."

(updates to add Ryanair expects to win appeal)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC chief executive Michael O'Leary he will appeal the European Commission's decision 
today that some of the aid it received from Belgium's Wallonia regional government is illegal and must be repaid.
    "This decision will be appealed to the European Court (of Justice).
We believe the appeal will be supported by many other low-fare airlines, regional airports and consumer groups," 
O'Leary said.
    "The European Commission should not be interfering in the operation of the free market," he said.
    O'Leary said Ryanair will not be pulling out of Brussels' Charleroi airport, but it will be reducing business and 
routes there.
    He said the only beneficiaries of the decision are the complainants, "Brussels' Zaventum airport and the high-fare 
carriers who fly there".
    He said there will be reduced competition and higher fares at Charlereoi "thanks to the failure of the European 
Commission to promote competition, lower fares and consumer interests".
    The commission's decision has set a precedent for airlines across Europe and "is being pored over as we speak" 
by Groupe Air France, Alitalia SpA and Deutsche Lufthansa AG lawyers, he said.
    The commission said earlier Ryanair will have to repay at least 4 mln eur of a total 15 mln state aid received.
    But O'Leary said he expects the decision to be overturned as the commission had failed to consider all the 
evidence and to apply the EU's private market investor principle.
    This principle is intended to ensure equal treatment between public-sector operators and private firms.

Low-cost airline easyJet PLC said the European Commission ruling on Ryanair Holdings PLC's use of Brussels' 
Charleroi airport would help clarify deals between airlines and airports.
    Earlier, the Commission ruled that some of the aid Ryanair receives from Belgium's Wallonia regional 
government is illegal and should be repaid.
 Ray Webster, easyJet chief executive, said: "Today's ruling is good news for Europe's airlines as it removes a very 
substantial degree of uncertainty that has been hanging over European aviation for some time."
    Webster believes the Commission plans to use this ruling as a basis for uniform guidelines on airport landing 
charges and tariffs across the EU, thereby helping to set standards for deals between airlines and publicly owned 
airports.
    "It also makes a very clear commitment to the development of the low-cost airline sector," he added.
    "We are particularly keen to ensure that the Commission does not inhibit any airline (traditional, charter of low-
cost) from seeking and obtaining differential charges -- provided that the charges relate to the cost of provision of 
the specific services used," said Webster.
    As it currently stands, to apply the same flat rate at an airport for two airlines using very different quality services 
means a subsidy from the efficient to the inefficient, he added.
    Webster also called on the Commission to avoid taking "any steps that strengthen the monopoly power of 
government-owned airports."
    "At present, the gulf between competitive, privately owned airports and inefficient, publicly owned airports is 
excessive and unjustified," said Webster.

Irish Transport Minister Seamus Brennan said he was "reasonably satisified" regarding the scope of the potential 
impact of a European Commission ruling against Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC for receiving state aid 
for using Charleroi airport in Belgium.
    "I am reasonably satisfied now that regional airports will not be unduly affected by this," Brennan told Agence 
France-Presse in an interview, stressing that the decision only concerned Charleroi airport where Ryanair serves 
southern Belgium.
    "The decision is a more moderate one than the one expected," he said.
    The European Commission ruled today that 25-30 pct of the 15 mln eur Ryanair received from from Belgium's 
Wallonia regional government, which owns Charleroi airport, was illegal
    The minister, whose country currently holds the European Union's rotating six month presidency, said he would 
bring up the subject of low-cost airlines at the next transport ministers meeting in March.
    The ministers would have a chance then to voice their opinions on budget airlines before the Commission draws 
up general rules.
    For Brennan, Brussels' decision was "a setback for the airline, but not a general setback for aviation in Europe or 
in Ireland".
    "I am also pleased that the commissioners confined themselves to dealing with a specific case and didn't make 
general rules," he said.
    Brennan had told Brussels in a letter made public earlier Tuesday that he was "very concerned" by the ruling.
    A spokesman for Brennan, who is currently chairman of the European Union Council of Ministers, said the letter 
was sent by the minister on Monday to EU Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio.
 Brennan, who discussed the issue with de Palacio in Brussels last week, said in his letter that "the Irish 
administration is very concerned at the possible impact that this decision, if adopted, could have on Irish and 
European aviation both as regards airports and in particular, low-cost air services," the spokesman said.
    "We are particularly concerned that the draft decision on the Charleroi case would appear to establish more 
general rules under which issues regarding airport charges, discount schemes and other incentives which airports 
may offer airlines would be judged.

- DaimlerChrysler and Volvo fell in U.S. trading Tuesday after the two European automakers reported disappointing 
sales.
But moves up by Ryanair and Amvescap helped push the Bank of New York European ADR Index higher by 0.65 
points to close at 112.57.
DaimlerChrysler  said U.S. sales for its Chrysler division rose 9 percent in January, compared with the same month 
in 2003. But its U.S. Mercedes-Benz sales were off 3.1 percent. Shares were down $1.17, or 3 percent, at $46.39.
Volvo  lost $1.70, or 5 percent, to $31.22 after the Swedish truck maker's Chairman Lars Ramquist resigned. Volvo 
also missed analysts' expectations for its fourth-quarter financials.
Ryanair  jumped $2.75, or 8 percent, to $35.75. The European Union ruled that the discount airline can keep about 
75 percent of the money it was given by a Belgian airport to support its service there. Investors had expected the 
EU to rule that all of the money would have to be paid back.
Also, the Irish Stock Exchange is set to investigate the recent sale of 44 million shares in Ryanair by the sons of the 
discount airline's founder, Tony Ryan, the Daily Telegraph reported Tuesday. The shares were sold two weeks 
before the airline's first-ever profit warning last week.
Swiss biotech Serono  fell 67 cents, or 4 percent, to $18.55 following its fourth-quarter report and forecast for 2004. 
Some analysts said they were skeptical that Serono would be able to meet its growth forecasts for the year. 
Meanwhile, the company reported a 36.8 percent rise in fourth-quarter net income.
U.K.-based fund manager Amvescap  rose 43 cents, or 3 percent, to $15.54 after it topped most analysts' estimates 
with its 2003 pretax profit of $471.1 million.
Imperial Tobacco  was up $1.49, or 4 percent, to $41.99 after it said that cost-cutting should help lift 2004 profits 
despite higher taxes.

Singapore Airlines vowed today to remain a premium carrier, despite taking stake in the soon-to-be-launched 
budget airline Tiger Airways.
    Chairman Koh Boon Hwee said the group will will not get involved in the daily operations of Tiger Airways and 
stressed both Singapore Airlines and no-frills carriers can serve niches in the market.
    "SIA will confine its role to being a stakeholder (in Tiger Airways)," Koh said in a speech launching the maiden 
voyage of SIA's first non-stop flight to the US.
    "We are not planning to involve ourselves in the day-to-day low cost carrier operations. It is not within our field of 
expertise, nor is it something we profess to know much about."
    Koh said that, like in the hotel industry, there are clients who prefer premium services and are willing to pay the 
price.
    "We've got Tiger Airways taking care of the low-cost, no frills segment and there will be customers for that… but 
there will also be demand obviously for the premier services that SIA has traditionally provided," he said.
    Asia has recently seen the emergence of several low-cost carriers, which, analysts say, could challenge the 
dominance of bigger carriers, such as SIA.
    One of the most popular is Malaysian budget airline AirAsia, which has set up base at Singapore's doorstep and 
is negotiating to be allowed to fly from the city state.
    In December, SIA announced it will set up Tiger Airways in a four-party venture that will begin flying from here 
this year.
 SIA's partners will be Ryanair founder Tony Ryan's Irelandia Investments, the Singapore government investment 
arm Temasek Holdings and US private investors Indigo Partners.
    ValueAir, another budget carrier that a former SIA executive set up, is set to begin operations from Singapore in 
the middle of the year.

Chip stocks under some pressure in largely thin trade. Volatility on the currency markets helped maintain a cautious 
tone. Cisco Systems  was marked 20 cents in euro trading in Frankfurt at $26.39 as positioning continues in the

Global Markets
Japanese stocks struggled overnight and German stocks were lower as the dollar tumbled against the major 
currencies. Reports that traces of the deadly poison ricin were found in a U.S. Senate office underpinned the 
bearishness on the dollar, analysts said. The euro surged 1.2 percent on the dollar to $1.2575. The British pound 
rose to $1.8369 and the dollar weakened against the yen, declining as low as 105.20 - a fresh low at levels not

Colgate-Palmolive  said: "Looking ahead to 2004, we feel strongly that we will meet global competitive requirements

Federated Investors  has set up a $7.6 million fund to repay mutual fund investors resulting from frequent late 
trading activities in its funds. The Pittsburgh,Pa.-based fund company said its fourth-quarter results will include a 
charge of $12.4 million for expenses related to its internal review.
Tyco , Colgate, Ryanair , ALTH
Tyco International  said its fiscal first quarter income from continuing operations rose 27 percent to $719 million and 
that revenue rose 9 percent to $9.7 billion. The impact of the weak dollar contributed 7 percentage points of the 
increase in sales, it said. Sales growth was led by Healthcare and Electronics divisions, it said. Looking ahead, 
Tyco left its outlook for earnings unchanged for fiscal 2004.
Whirlpool Corp.  posted fourth-quarter net earnings of $125 million, or $1.76 per share. Results were a penny 
ahead of the average forecast, according to a Reuters Research poll. In the year-ago period, the appliances maker 
posted a loss amid charges. Fourth quarter sales rose 14 percent to $3.36 billion, ahead of the $3 billion forecast. 
Excluding the weaker dollar impact, net sales increased 7 percent. Looking ahead, Whirlpool said it sees "positive 
economic trends and the continuing momentum of our brands."
Ryanair  surged 6.2 percent to $35.05, following the London shares higher after the European Union said that 70-
75 percent of the state aid it received from Charleroi, Belgium to operate flights was legal. The ruling may dispel 
fears Brussels is going to put an end to the benefits Ryanair receives from small regional airports.

U.S. stock futures were drifting early Tuesday with chip stocks under some pressure in largely thin trade. Volatility 
on the currency markets helped maintain a cautious tone.
Japanese stocks struggled overnight and German stocks were lower as the dollar tumbled against the major 
currencies. Reports that traces of the deadly poison ricin were found in a U.S. Senate office underpinned the 
bearishness on the dollar, analysts said.
The euro surged 1.2 percent on the dollar to $1.2575. The British pound rose to $1.8369 and the dollar weakened 
against the yen, declining as low as 105.20 - a fresh low at levels not seen since Sept. 2000.
G-7 ministers are gathering in Florida this week with currencies expected to be a focus. Europeans are keen to take 
the pressure of the euro, while U.S. officials and Japan are looking for European policies to underpin the early 
shoots of recovery in Europe.
Turning to stocks, the Dow industrials futures were down 22 points at 10,463 after 8 a.m. Eastern. The Nasdaq 100 
tracker   was off 0.2 percent on the ECNs.
Cisco Systems  was marked 20 cents in euro trading in Frankfurt at $26.39 as positioning continues in the 
networker ahead of its quarterly results and outlook after the close. Microsoft  was also holding a few points above 
its close.
A Goldman Sachs downgrade late Monday on some semiconductor equipment stocks triggered some sector stocks 
declines, but dealers said none of the U.S. equipment stocks had been active in London.
Goldman dropped its view on the semi equipment group to neutral from attractive; analysts think "the industry has 
now moved beyond its normalized cash flow levels at which time cyclical stocks stop outperforming the market." 
The broker cut Applied Materials , Novellus Systems  and Advanced Energy  to in-line from out-perform. In Europe, 
it cut ASML .
The broker also upped what it termed "defensive names" KLA-Tencor  and Formfactor  to outperform from in-line.
Intel Corp.  was down 0.4 percent at $30.20. AMAT was last at $21.20 on Instinet, down 1.8 percent.
Focus stocks
Dow futures drift, chip equip in focus - UPDATE 1
Discount airline Ryanair  surged 6.2 percent to $35.05, following the London shares higher after the European 
Union said that 70-75 percent of the state aid it received from Charleroi, Belgium to operate flights was legal. The 
ruling may dispel fears Brussels is going to put an end to the benefits Ryanair receives from small regional airports.
Sprint Corp.  said its wireline phone business posted net income of $360 million, or 40 cents a share, in the fourth 
quarter, up from $294 million, or 33 cents, a year ago. Revenue fell 3.6 percent to $3.54 billion.
Fund manager Amvescap  said funds under management totaled $370.6 billion at the end of December from 
$332.6 billion a year ago. Amvescap operates the Invesco and AIM line of mutual funds.
"Investment performance of our U.S. retail funds improved during the second half of the year adding to the strength 
of our comprehensive range of global investment products… While the regulatory investigations will have 
implications for our company, we remain confident about the outlook for the asset management industry and the 
future for Amvescap," the company said.
Allos Therapeutics  rose 20 percent on Instinet to $4.23. It said the Food and Drug Administration accepted its New 
Drug Application to market RSR13 (efaproxiral) as an adjunct to whole brain radiation therapy for the treatment of 
brain metastases in patients with breast cancer.
German automakers on Tuesday were the worst performing sector in Europe. Volkswagen  was hit 2.8 percent by 
its plan to give away free air conditioners to help boost sales of its struggling Golf line in Germany.
DaimlerChrysler  dropped 2.6 percent as 37-percent-owned Mitsubishi Motors' capital increase will reportedly be 
double what had been anticipated. The weak dollar -- which last declined more than 1 percent on the day -- also 
contributed to the decline. BMW  declined 1.6 percent as well.
Colgate-Palmolive  said: "Looking ahead to 2004, we feel strongly that we will meet global competitive requirements 
and at the same time deliver record sales and profits once again."
Broker calls
Merrill Lynch raised its rating on two oil equipment stocks, lifting Diamond Offshore Drilling  and Transocean  to 
neutral from sell amid expectations for improving demand.
J.P. Morgan Securities raised Avid Technology  to overweight from neutral, citing price as well as "the broader 
penetration by digital technologies of the growing professional video and audio production markets" among other 
issues.

EU research commissioner, Philippe Busquin said the commission's decision on state aid to low-cost airline Ryanair 
is "balanced".
    "It's a balanced decision which allows Charleroi to continue to operate and even to develop new lines since we 
have accepted launch costs," he said.
    Asked about whether Ryanair would leave Charleroi, the commissioner said "there is no reason for Ryanair to 
penalise Charleroi whatever happens".

Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based no-frills airline, said it carried 1.71 mln passengers in January, up from

    The rolling 12 months passenger total was 21.8 mln.
 Load factor -- the number of passengers as a percentage of available capacity -- was 71 pct in January, down from 
76 pct last year, bringing the rolling 12 months total to 81 pct.
    Some 96 pct of all ticket sales were made over the internet.

received from Belgium's Charleroi airport.
    At 10.56 am Ryanair shares were up 17 cents at 4.93 eur.

The European Commission said Ryanair Holdings PLC must repay at least 4 mln eur of the subsidies it received in 
2001-2003 from Belgium's Wallonia regional government, which owns Charleroi airport.
    The commission said it authorises certain forms of aid which permit genuine development of new routes under 
clearly defined conditions.
    It said however that other direct aid "is incompatible with the proper functioning of the internal market and will 
have to be repaid".

European Parliament president Pat Cox has urged the European Commission to consider the impact of its decision 
concerning state subisidies offered to Ryanair Holding PLC on future cases.
    Ryanair has been in a battle with the commission for several months concerning benefits it has received as an 
incentive to operate low-cost flights out of Charleroi, near Brussels.
 The president, who is Irish, has written to the commission expressing his concern that tomorrow's decision could 
have "wide-ranging implications which go far beyond the specific case of the use of Charelroi".
    He said he has asked for reassurances that "an assessment has been made of the possible knock-on effects and 
implications that a precedent set by this particular case might have for regional airports, regional development, 
consumer preference and service provision".
    Cox said: "I fully respect the rights of the European Commission to act on this issue. My only consideration is to 
ensure that the wider policy implications that could arise from this ruling on Ryanair have been fully taken into 
account."

Ryanair Holdings PLC said the media briefing given to journalists this morning by the EU Commission on the 
Charleroi case - the day before the full Commission is due to take a vote -- will have a serious prejudicial effect on 
the Commission's vote tomorrow.
    "In an unprecedented move this morning, the EU Commission's Transport Directorate gave Irish journalists 
specific details on the Commission's decision in the Charleroi case in advance of the full Commission's vote on the 
decision tomorrow morning. This will have a seriously prejudicial affect on the Commission's vote tomorrow," said a 
spokesman for the Irish no-frills airline in a statement.
    Ryanair has been in a battle with the Commission for several months concerning benefits it has received as an 
incentive to operate low-cost flights out of Charleroi, near Brussels.
    Earlier today, European Parliament president Pat Cox urged the EU Commission to consider the impact of its 
decision concerning state subisidies offered to Ryanair on future cases.
    The president, who is Irish, has written to the commission expressing his concern that tomorrow's decision could 
have "wide-ranging implications which go far beyond the specific case of the use of Charelroi".
    The Ryanair spokesman said "This 'off-the-record' press conference shows that the Commission is aware of the 
negative impact of this decision on European consumers and the development of the low fares airlines at under-
utilised regional airports throughout Europe."
    "Otherwise, they wouldn't be going to such lengths to privately brief and leak details out before the full 
Commission has had the opportunity to review the facts and consider the wider implications of this case."
 Strong objections to the proposed decision have already been made by the Forum of European Regional Airports, 
the Assembly of European Regions and this afternoon by Cox all of whom raise serious concerns over the wider 
implications for Europe of this negative decision, said the spokesman.
    "The Commission's proposed decision will reverse 20 years of competition, deregulation and low fares air travel 
and consumers will suffer with higher fares, less competition and less choice," he warned.

(Adding possible actions against other carriers, more comments)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC will take legal action against other airlines, as well as against the European Commission, 
if the commission rules to outlaw the discounts Ryanair receives for flying to Brussels' Charleroi airport.
    On Tuesday, the Commission is expected to rule that Ryanair receives an unlawful form of state aid from the 
Belgium government, in a decision that will have wide ramifications.
    Many small, state-owned airports offer incentives to airlines in an attempt to boost tourism. The Charleroi 
decision is expected to put an end to the practice.
    "If there is an unacceptable decision, Ryanair will not only appeal it but has instructed its advisors to initiate state 
aid cases and complaints against every other airline flying into every state airport which offers concessions and 
discounts," the Dublin-based carrier said in a statement.
    Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary complained on Sunday that the commission was simply "interfering in 
the operation of a free market".
    Interviewed on BBC television, O'Leary said that his carrier merely received "discounts" from Charleroi in 
exchange for bringing around 2.5 mln passengers a year into the region.
    "The airport supports the deal, Ryanair supports the deal, the consumers -- the two and half million people a year 
who use it -- support the deal," he said.
    "And now a bunch of bureaucrats in Brussels want to tell the airport to put up the cost, wants to tell the airline, 
Ryanair, to put up the fares, and expected two and a half million consumers to pay higher prices."
 Separately, the Independent on Sunday O'Leary as saying: "We will challenge them in the European courts. The 
ruling will force us to put up fares and may make us tear up routes. A lot of regional airports will not be able to grow 
as a result."
    The low-cost airline will go through the European Court of First Instance, said Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's head of 
regulatory affairs.
    "We are not receiving state aid. The Commission is using the case to set a precedent in the industry, but there is 
no problem with it legally or factually," he was cited as saying.

    He said the Irish and UK governments were also "very concerned about this" and may apply pressure to reverse 
the ruling.

Ryanair loses case brought by wheelchair user
Ryanair loses case brought by wheelchair user

Length: 418 words

A disabled traveller who was forced to pay to use a wheelchair at London Stansted airport won his landmark case 
against the Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC today.
    Ryanair was ordered by a UK court to pay 1,336 stg to Bob Ross, 54, who suffers from cerebral palsy, which 
makes it difficult for him to walk.
    Judge Crawford Lindsay ruled that Ryanair had acted unlawfully by not ensuring that a wheelchair was provided 
free of charge for Ross to use at Stansted airport to the northeast of London.
    Ross was charged 18 pounds for the use of a wheelchair when he travelled from London to Perpignan in 
southwestern France in February 2002 and again on his return journey a month later.
    Ross told the court that he rarely used a wheelchair, preferring crutches or sticks instead, but that he found 
walking extremely painful.
    Judge Lindsay said in his judgment: "As appears from the evidence, the reasons for Ryanair's policy were 
commercial."
    "They could and, in my judgment, should have changed that policy so as to pay the cost for all passengers who 
required a wheelchair."
    Ross told reporters outside the court: "I hope that Ryanair will see that it's wrong to charge disabled passengers 
for the use of wheelchairs and get rid of the charges."
    But Ryanair said in a statement that it would appeal against the decision, which it criticised as "defective". It was 
the responsibility of the airport authorities to provide wheelchair assistance, the company argued.
 "We wish to reiterate that Ryanair has never charged any wheelchair passenger for assistance at any airport 
including Stansted," the statement said, noting that Ross was not travelling in a wheelchair.
    "In the case of wheelchair passengers, Ryanair absorbs the cost of this assistance at Stansted and the tiny 
minority of other airports around Europe where this service is not provided free of charge by the airport operator."
    The Disability Rights Commission, which launched the case on behalf of Ross, wants Ryanair to pay 
compensation to 35 disabled people who have complained about paying the wheelchair charge.

    "Perhaps before counting their pennies, Ryanair should have considered the cost to their reputation and the 
distress caused to disabled people by acting in such a discriminatory way," said the commission's chairman, Bert 
Massie.

Irish Transport Minister Seamus Brennan said he will take Ryanair Holdings PLC's problems over subsidies 
allegedly paid by its Charleroi hub in Belgium to the next meeting of his EU colleagues.
    In a statement issue by his ministry, Brennan said the Irish EU presidency cannot intervene directly in any 
European Commission ruling against the budget airline, which is expected to be ordered to refund 3-10 mln eur in 
subsidies by the airport and the Walloon regional government.
 He said it would also be inappropriate for Ireland to take a position specifically in favour of Ryanair, but that he 
nevertheless wants the issue discussed at the next Transport Ministers' council.
    Brennan said he discussed Ryanair with Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio on Tuesday, making the 
point that any move to penalise the no-frills airline could also have implications for flag carrier Aer Lingus and 
regional airports in Ireland.

(Updating to add more detail from Ryanair statement)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based low-cost airline, warned that if current fares trends continue, its year to 
end-March 2004 net profit before exceptionals will fall by up to 10 pct.
    Announcing its third quarter to Dec 31 2003 results the airline, which operates 146 routes across Europe, said it 
remains "very cautious" in its outlook for fares and yields.
    It recorded an 11 pct fall in average fares over the third quarter and based on initial bookings for the fourth 
quarter it now expects fares to decline by between 25-30 pct versus the comparable quarter last year. This 
compares with guidance last November of a 10-15 pct reduction.
    "If these lower fares and yields occur (bearing in mind we have not completed even the first month of this 
quarter) then we would expect net profit before exceptionals for the fiscal year to reduce by up to 10 pct from a net 
profit of 239 mln eur last year to approximately 215 mln eur for the current fiscal year."
    Ryanair said the anticipated sharp fall in yields reflects the airline's continuing substantial capacity growth, the 
launch in January and February of two new bases at Rome Ciampino and Barcelona Girona, the impact of sterling's 
continuing weakness against the euro, and intense price competition all over Europe.
    "Despite this difficult market Ryanair continues to profitably develop new routes, new bases and grow market 
share," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
 "In many cases Ryanair is leading the downward pressure on prices and yields, but unlike our competitors we 
continue to generate world leading profit margins as a result of our aggressive cost management and lowest cost 
base."
    Third-quarter traffic grew 54 pct to a record 6.1 mln, boosting revenue 37 pct to 255.0 mln eur.
    Profit after tax but before exceptional items and goodwill (adjusted net profit) rose by 10 pct from 43.2 mln eur to 
a record 47.5 mln.
    EPS pre-ex and goodwill increased 10 pct to 6.27 cents.
    Operating costs rose by 42 pct -- significantly less than the rate of traffic growth -- as unit costs fell 8 pct, whilst 
after tax margins declined from 23 pct to 19 pct.
Ryanair warns FY net profit pre-ex could fall 10 pct UPDATE
    Ryanair ended the quarter with cash of 1.12 bln eur.
    The airline expects yield decline in the year to end-March 2005 to be lower than the current year's fall.
    This is because it does not expect any further weakness of sterling against the euro.
    Also from May, Ryanair's rate of capacity growth will fall from over 50 pct for the past two years to just 20 pct per 
annum, while initial indications suggest that the two new bases (Rome Ciampino and Barcelona Girona) will be 
significantly stronger performers than some of the new routes and bases launched in previous years.
    The airline also expects average seat costs for the coming year to continue to decline strongly.
    It is initiating a detailed review and reduction of its cost base, including reducing airport, handling and 
maintenance costs and cutting lease costs on some of the former Buzz aircraft.
    Ryanair revealed these leases are already the subject of legal proceedings. If these are not successful the 
aircraft will be returned and Buzz Stansted Ltd wound down, it warned. Ryanair acquired Buzz from KLM Royal 
Dutch Airlines NV last year.
    Meanwhile, the airline expects EU Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio to rule on Feb 3 that substantial 
parts of its 25-year commercial deal with the Walloon government and the state-owned Brussels Charleroi airport 
constitute unlawful state aid.
    It anticipates the Commission will seek repayments "in the millions of euros" and limit the length of discounted 
contracts with airports to just three years.
    Such a ruling would effectively ban Ryanair from receiving similar subsidies in the future.
    The airline plans to appeal to the European Court in Luxembourg to have the decision overturned.
    Ryanair shares closed Tuesday at 6.77 eur, valuing the company at 5.12 bln eur.

Irish discount airline Ryanair fell 29 percent in U.S. trading after the company warned that lower fares could lead to 
smaller profits this year.
Shares of Ryanair  declined $14.18 to $35.13. While the company insisted it won't raise airfares, it said that profits 
for the year ending in March are likely to come in at $271 million, compared with $298.6 million a year ago.
The Bank of New York European ADR Index also ended lower down 1.20 points at 113.08. The index moved into 
the red shortly after the Federal Reserve announced it was leaving interest rates unchanged but hinted that an 
increase could be in the future.
In other stocks news: mobile operator Vodafone  fell $105, or 4 percent, to $25.62 after a company conference call 
spurned fresh concerns that it may launch a bid for U.S. carrier AT&T Wireless .
On a conference call discussing key performance statistics, CEO Arun Sarin said Vodafone is eyeing developments 
in the U.S. but would not comment further on market speculation that the company is interested in buying AT&T 
Wireless, AFX reported.
The move to buy AT&T Wireless would be unpopular with investors, in part as it would require Vodafone to shed its 
minority stake in Verizon Wireless.
Sarin also reiterated the company's interest in buying SFR, the French mobile operator majority owned by Vivendi 
Universal , although he added there were no plans to enter the open market to buy Vivendi shares. Vivendi was off 
77 cents, or 3 percent, at $26.52.
Elsewhere in the sector, Ericsson  lost 60 cents, or 3 percent, to $21.72, Alcatel  slipped 38 cents to $16.43 and 
Nokia  was down 46 cents at $20.62.
German chip firm Infineon Technologies  slipped 6 cents to $14.83 after it said it will buy Taiwanese chip designer 
ADMtek for $100 million.
Franco-German pharmaceuticals company Aventis  rose $1.46 to $75.86. The stock is likely to remain volatile as 
investors wait to see if the company will welcome takeover bids from its peers, while rejecting a hostile bid from 
French peer Sanofi Synthelabo .

- Airline stocks fell Wednesday morning amid worries about the spread of avian influenza in Asia and a warning 
from European discount carrier Ryanair about falling airfares.
The Amex Airline Index  fell 2.4 percent to 65.42.
Reports from Asia said cases of the "bird flu" have been reported in China, pressuring stocks in the region and 
elsewhere.
Northwest Airlines  slipped 39 cents to $12.85.
Ryanair Holdings  fell 30 percent to $34.33 in U.S. trading after warning that low fares in Europe are hurting its 
profitability.
Alaska Air Group  fell 40 cents to $28.31 after reporting narrower fourth-quarter losses and its first yearly profit 
since 1999. Fuel and labor costs rose in the quarter, however.
Other movers included AMR , parent of American Airlines, with shares down 21 cents to $17.17.
JetBlue  fell 9.5 percent to $23.91 ahead of Thursday's fourth-quarter report. Goldman Sachs analyst Glenn Engel 
downgraded the stock ahead of the results.
"Despite JetBlue's 45 percent decline since its all-time high three months ago, we believe cyclical downside risks 
outweigh any likely near term upside, and feel an underperform rating is more appropriate," Engel wrote. Engel's 
new 2004 profit estimate for 2004 is 90 cents a share, down from $1 a share and for 2005 the new estimate is 
$1.15, down from $1.25.
A rare advancer, Atlantic Coast Airlines  rose 12 cents to $9.37. The airline, which is transforming itself from a 
regional airline into a low-cost carrier, reported a fourth-quarter profit of $13.7 million, or 30 cents, reversing last 
year's loss of $1 million, or 2 cents a share. Excluding items, the airline earned $21 million, or 46 cents a share -

- Airline stocks closed lower Wednesday as worries over the spread of avian influenza in Asia and a warning from 
European discount carrier Ryanair combined with a perceived shift in the Federal Open Market Committee's 
willingness to raise U.S. interest rates.
The Amex Airline Index  fell 5.3 percent to 63.51. In its interest-rate-policy meeting, the Fed did say it thinks the 
U.S. economy is getting stronger and has left rates unchanged, for now.
Reports from Asia said cases of the "bird flu" have been reported in China, pressuring stocks in the region and 
elsewhere.
Northwest Airlines , which flies extensively to destinations in Asia, slipped 80 cents, or 6 percent, to $12.44.
Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings  fell 29 percent to $35.13 in U.S. trading after warning that low fares in Europe are 
hurting its profitability.
Alaska Air Group  fell $2.10, or 7.3 percent, to $26.61 after reporting a narrower fourth-quarter loss and its first 
yearly profit since 1999. Fuel and labor costs rose in the quarter, however.
Other movers included AMR , parent of American Airlines, with its shares down 88 cents to $16.50.
Pre-report downgrade
Also under pressure, JetBlue Airways  fell $2.43, or 9.2 percent, to $24 after Goldman Sachs analyst Glenn Engel 
downgraded his rating on the stock a day ahead of the low-cost carrier's fourth-quarter financial results.
"Despite JetBlue's 45 percent decline since its all-time high three months ago, we believe cyclical downside risks 
outweigh any likely near-term upside, and feel an underperform rating is more appropriate," Engel said in a 
research note.
His new profit estimates for JetBlue are 90 cents for 2004, down from $1 a share previously, and $1.15 a share, 
down from $1.25, for 2005.
And Atlantic Coast Airlines  fell 36 cents to $8.89. The carrier, which is transforming itself from a regional airline into 
a low-cost operator, reported a fourth-quarter profit of $13.7 million, or 30 cents, reversing the prior year's loss of $1 
million, or 2 cents a share.
Sector closes down after Fed; JetBlue, Alaska Air drop - UPDATE 3
Excluding special items, Atlantic Coast earned $21 million, or 46 cents a share -- ahead of analysts' 40-cent 
consensus estimate, as compiled by Reuters Research. Quarterly revenue rose 9.6 percent, reaching $224 million.

- Airline stocks remained in the red Wednesday as worries over the spread of avian influenza in Asia and a warning 
from European discount carrier Ryanair about falling fares overshadowed the Federal Open Market Committee's 
decision to leave U.S. interest rates alone.
The Amex Airline Index  fell 3.3 percent to 64.83. In its interest-rate policy meeting, the Fed did say it thinks the 
U.S. economy is getting stronger.
Reports from Asia said cases of the "bird flu" have been reported in China, pressuring stocks in the region and 
elsewhere.
Northwest Airlines , which flies extensively to destinations in Asia, slipped 50 cents to $12.71.
Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings  fell 29 percent to $34.95 in U.S. trading after warning that low fares in Europe are 
hurting its profitability.
Alaska Air Group  fell $1.76 to $26.97 after reporting a narrower fourth-quarter loss and its first yearly profit since 
1999. Fuel and labor costs rose in the quarter, however.
Other movers included AMR Corp. , parent of American Airlines, with its shares down 35 cents to $17.03.
Pre-report downgrade
Also under pressure, JetBlue Airways  fell 8.6 percent to $24.12 as Goldman Sachs analyst Glenn Engel 
downgraded his rating on the stock a day ahead of the low-cost carrier's fourth-quarter financial results.
"Despite JetBlue's 45 percent decline since its all-time high three months ago, we believe cyclical downside risks 
outweigh any likely near-term upside, and feel an underperform rating is more appropriate," Engel said in a 
research note.
His new profit estimates for JetBlue are 90 cents for 2004, down from $1 a share previously, and $1.15 a share, 
down from $1.25, for 2005.
And Atlantic Coast Airlines  fell 13 cents to $9.13. The carrier, which is transforming itself from a regional airline into 
a low-cost operator, reported a fourth-quarter profit of $13.7 million, or 30 cents, reversing the prior year's loss of $1 
million, or 2 cents a share.

     Share prices closed higher amid expectations the US
Federal Reserve will signal later today that it intends to leave interest rates
unchanged at their current 45-year low of 1 pct, dealers said.
    The Xetra DAX 30 index closed at 4,150.24, up 15.82 points or 0.38 pct,
having traded between 4,105.97-4,157.18 this session.

bund future was at 114.66, up 0.14.
    The euro last traded at 1.2627 usd, compared with 1.2585 in late London
trade.
    US stocks pushed higher thanks to a batch of upbeat earnings reports --
notably from household products giant Proctor & Gamble -- and on expectations
that the latest FOMC meeting will leave US interest rates on hold.
    Munich Re rose 1.93 eur or 2.00 pct 98.41 as investors in the insurance
sector switched from Allianz -- down 1.66 to 106.49 -- on news that JP Morgan
has removed the latter from its 'European Focus List'.
    Bayer was the top performing stock, up 0.52 eur or 2.14 pct at 24.78 eur
amid speculation surrounding consolidation within the pharmaceutical sector on
the back of Sanofi-Synthelabo's 48 bln eur hostile bid for rival Aventis.
    Infineon added 0.18 or 1.52 pct to 12.00 as investors greeted the strategy

Technology, for 80 mln eur.
 An analyst said that the deal is a "good strategic move" for Infineon, with
another analyst, at Heleba Trust, noting that the step will improve the group's
position in the growing market for broadband technology.
    Lufthansa dropped 0.11 to 14.58 after Ryanair warned on full year earnings,
and rising cases of bird flu in Asia forced European airlines investors, who had
largely given a muted reaction to the outbreak up until now, to sit up and take
notice.
    Fellow travel stock, TUI, lost 0.65 eur or 3.35 pct to 18.75.
    Deutsche Telekom dropped 0.32 eur or 1.93 pct to 16.23 even though the
German finance ministry said that neither the German government nor the
state-owned KfW bank have any plans to sell shares in the telecoms incumbent in
the coming weeks.
    Earlier Wirtschaftswoche magazine reported that the KfW plans to sell shares
in the coming weeks.
    WCM soared by 0.12 eur or 11.54 pct to 1.16 on the MDAX even though chairman
Roland Flach denied rumours circulating the market today that he will step down,
and that his company will merge with IVG Immobilien.
    On the TecDAX, GPC Biotech surged by 1.05 eur or 10.26 pct to 11.28 after
Goldman Sachs upgraded its view on the stock to 'outperform' from 'neutral'.

Shares were slightly lower in early afternoon trade pressured in particular by profit taking in telecoms and SKF, but 
with falls extending throughout the market, brokers said.
    At 1.50 pm Stockholmsboersen All-Share was down 0.26 pct at 205.72, while the Attract40 was up 0.24 pct at 
59.16 and the OMX down 0.34 pct at 672.89. Total turnover amounted to 6.957 bln skr.
    SKF B was down 1.90 pct at 283.50 after Deutsche Bank cut its 2004 and 2005 estimates for the company 
following its fourth quarter result yesterday.
    Among other engineering stocks, Atlas Copco A was down 1.25 pct at 276.50, and Sandvik up 0.39 pct at 
256.50.
    Ericsson B was down 0.61 pct at 16.20 skr bid, and Nokia down 0.32 pct at 153.50.
    In the airline sector SAS was down 2.67 pct at 73 pressured by Ryanair's profit warning, concerns over an EU 
ruling on airport discounts, and the threat of a strike by Swedish baggage handlers due to start this Friday.
    Earlier SAS said it is proposing the merger of its Norwegian units, Braathans and SAS Norway to reduce costs as 
part of its 'Turnaround 2005' program. The airline said that the move would not result in any further savings than the 
14 bln skr already announced on the launch of Turanround 2005.
    In the forestry sector SCA B was down 1.52 pct at 291.50 and Holmen B flat at 248.50 amid concerns of the

quarter result tomorrow, while Skandia was up 0.30 pct at 32.90, TeliaSonera down 0.27 pct at 37.60, and SEB A

Stocks were higher expectations the Federal Reserve will signal later today that it still plans to maintain ultra-low 
interest rates. Yet market tracker stocks moved off peaks after a weak durable goods in December. Total orders for 
durable goods were unchanged in December after falling a revised 2.3 percent in November. Economists expected 
a 2.2 percent gain. Communications equipment orders plunged 18.1 percent to the lowest level in seven years. 
Time Warner  lent some early support; the media giant said it expects full-year 2004 percentage growth in operating 
income, excluding special items, to be in the "high-single digit to low-double digits", due to anticipated higher 
revenue and margins. Internet book seller Amazon.com , however, remained under pressure after gross margins 
fell below expectations in the latest quarter.
      
Global Markets
London stocks were higher  as the judge heading the inquiry into the death of weapons expert David Kelly said that 
he was satisfied concluding that Kelly had taken his own life.  The market advance came despite Ryanair  making 
clear it was becoming more difficult to be a profitable discount airline.

Breaking News -
Procter & Gamble , a Dow component,  posted a 22 percent rise in net earnings in the December quarter to $1.82 
billion, saying the profits growth as "driven by unit volume growth and manufacturing cost savings, which enabled 
marketing investments to sustain top line growth."
Looking ahead, P&G sounded some caution, saying "the current consensus estimate is at the top end of net 
earnings per share expectations for the quarter" for the March quarter.
Broadcom  surged close to 13.2 percent to $45.94 after it reported overnight a fourth-quarter profit as sales of its 
communications chips accelerated.
LaBranche & Co. , the NYSE specialist, said fourth quarter revenue dropped 38 percent to $70.9 million from 
$113.8 million a year ago as it swung to a net loss of $156.9 million, or $2.62 per share on a charge.

NetBank  warned that the current range of analyst forecasts for first-quarter earnings "may be high," as its mortgage 
business is likely to weaken due to lower production volumes and further declines in margins.
Reebok  reported fourth-quarter earnings of $28 million, or 44 cents per share, up from its year-ago profit of $16 
million, or 27 cents per share, and 2 cents ahead of the mean estimate of analysts polled by Thomson First Call. 
Sales jumped 11 percent in the latest three months to $844 million from $763 million in the same period a year 
earlier.
Cooper Cameron  reported fourth-quarter earnings of $4.1 million, or 7 cents per share, reversing a year-ago loss of 
$2.4 million, or 4 cents per share. Revenue totaled $443.2 million in the latest three months, a modest increase 
from its year-ago total of $384.7 million. The Houston-based oil equipment firm, however, said the latest results fell 
short of its prior forecasts due to its failure to meet delivery schedules on certain subsea systems projects

Shares in Europe's leading bourses had turned positive by midday after a solid flow of positive earnings and trading 
news and as Wall Street futures suggest the Dow will open higher, dealers said.
    At 12.01 pm, the STOXX 50 was up 18.42 points at 2,746.84 and the STOXX 600 was up 1.37 points at 238.95.
    Strategists will be poring over the FOMC statement later. The Fed Reserve is not expected to lift rates after 
promising to keep interest rates "accommodative for a considerable period" in December.
    In corporate news, another flow of sales and earnings news stole the limelight.
    Building materials group Lafarge was one of the few gainers on the STOXX 50 -- up 0.22 pct -- after the group 
said full year sales totalled 13.658 bln eur, above consensus estimates of 13.57 bln for the year and nearly 5 pct 
higher than expected in the fourth quarter. Saint Gobain added 2.31 pct, still supported by hopes that asbestos 
liabilities are falling.
    And Suez climbed 3.03 pct ahead of the utility's group's numbers tomorrow. Goldman Sachs repeated its 
'outperform' rating ahead of the news.
    Retailer Casino was up 0.2 pct after its in-line full year sales numbers, as some analysts said the numbers show 
the group clearly outperformed peer Carrefour in its hypermarkets. Carrefour was off 0.29 pct.
    Chemicals group Air Liquide pulled back early losses and rose 0.67 pct thanks to the very positive outlook 
statement that accompanied its full year sales numbers.
 UK mortgage lender Northern Rock -- rose 0.34 pct -- on its solid outlook and better than expected numbers. ABN 
Amro, Northern Rock's house broker, upgraded their rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'add'.
    UK insurers were up also this morning, bouncing back from their pummelling yesterday, when the heads of the 
five main life assurers were grilled over the mis-selling of long-term investment products. 
    But mobile phone operator Vodafone fell 2.41 pct despite better than expected new subscriber numbers -- after 
strong gains yesterday -- as mobile subscriber numbers in France and T-mobile numbers beat most broker 
forecasts.
    Airlines were in focus after Dublin-based low-cost airline, Ryanair, warned that if current fares trends continue, its 
year to end-March 2004 net profit before exceptionals will fall by up to 10 pct. Ryanair fell 25.04 pct.
Euroshares turn positive midday on solid trading news ahead of FOMC meeting
    But British Airways added 3.95 pct after confirming plans to slash jobs.

Dow stock futures higher ahead of Fed meeting

Body
U.S. stock futures were turning higher in pre-open trading on Wednesday amid expectations the Federal Reserve 
will signal later today that it still plans to maintain ultra-low interest rates.
The U.S. economy is growing at an unsustainable clip of 6 or 7 percent, but Fed officials aren't seen as nervous 
rates are too low.
As a result, economists don't expect any change in the FOMC's interest rate policy or in the wording of its 
controversial statement, which has promised for the past four meetings to keep interest rates "accommodative for a 
considerable period."
Dow industrials futures were up 22 points at 10,610; the S&P and Nasdaq futures were also a few points higher and 
coming off an overnight drift. European markets turned higher mid-morning as well.
Time Warner  lent some early support; the media giant said it expects full-year 2004 percentage growth in operating 
income, excluding special items, to be in the "high-single digit to low-double digits" vs. $8.8 billion in 2003, due to 
anticipated higher revenue and margins.
Operating income at each of its divisions except its filmed entertainment unit is expected to grow faster than in 
2003. Its AOL division is expected to grow operating income in the "low-double digit" percentage range over 2003's 
$1.5 billion, it said.
Internet book seller Amazon.com , however, remained under pressure. Among the few stocks trading in Frankfurt, 
Amazon shares were down over 3 percent at $53.41 - roughly in line with an overnight tumble after gross margins 
fell below expectations in the latest quarter.
Elsewhere, the potential for large-scale M&A continued to percolate.
AT&T Wireless'  banker sent a letter citing a Feb. 13 deadline to several potential bidders, including Cingular 
Wireless, which is owned by SBC Communications and BellSouth Corp.  as well as Nextel Communications ; 
Vodafone Group  and NTT DoCoMo Inc. , the Wall Street Journal reported.
Vodafone CEO Arun Sarin told reporters "we are watching developments in the U.S." when asked if Vodafone 
submitted a bid. "Whatever we do or not do will always be with our shareholders in mind." AFX said he declined 
further comment.
Dow stock futures higher ahead of Fed meeting
Meanwhile, VOD declined 2 percent after better-than-expected subscriber growth in the December quarter and the 
ambiguous comments on U.S. acquisitions.
Focus stocks
Ryanair  shares dropped over 20 percent in London trade after the airline warned profits could contract in the 
March-ending year by as much as 10 percent because of the pressure on yields. Its bleak outlook for yields, or 
revenue from average fares, impacted shares of its chief rival in discount flights, EasyJet , which eased 5 percent.
Overnight, Broadcom  surged close to 7 percent to $43.35 after it reported a fourth-quarter profit as sales of its 
communications chips accelerated.
Electronics contract manufacturer Flextronics  rose 6.4 percent to $18.166 after topping expectations for the 
quarter.. reported third-quarter income of $21.4 million, or 4 cents a share.
Broker Calls
Merrill Lynch raised its rating on Serono , the European biotech group, to buy from neutral. "We expect Serono to 
meet or beat its outlook" of profits and sales growth in 2003," the broker said. "Serono is an obvious play to benefit 
from a rally in the U.S. sector." Serono is slated to report Feb. 2.
J.P. Morgan Securities raised its rating on Scotts Co.  to an overweight from neutral. "We continue to think Scotts is 
well-positioned to gain share in the high growth U.S. lawn and garden category."
Mixed comment surfaced on Network Associates .  Credit Suisse First Boston raised its rating on NET to 
outperform, saying it believes "the consumer A/V business is positioned for strong growth, given the active virus 
environment (specifically Mydoom), and that Sniffer has finally stabilized."
Banc of America Securities also raised its rating on NET to buy overnight. SG Cowen sounded a cautious note. 
"Trouble in SMB, a top fix priority and market share issues in enterprise still leave doubts," the broker said. 
"IntruVert (is) a bright spot but still too small to help - Sniffer possibly for sale would mean even more reliance on 
heavily contested AV market. All in, leaves us on the sidelines."
Elsewhere, Morgan Stanley commented on the Sprint Corp.  realignment of its business model. "With this decision, 
we also expect the company will soon announce the recombination of the FON and PCS tracking stocks."

(updates with Ryanair quote, expected date of ruling)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC said it expects the European Commission to seek repayments in the millions of euros for 
funding received by the airline to run operations from its continental hub at Belgium's Charleroi airport.
    "There are portions of the arrangement that are going to be repaid.
It's going to be in millions of euros," Ryanair official Jim Callaghan told journalists following a meeting with 
commission officials.
    The commission is due to announce on Feb 3 its decision on whether Ryanair's contract with the publicly owned 
airport at Charleroi amounts to illegal state aid.
    An EU source said the verdict will be a "balanced" one.
    The airline has warned a negative ruling could harm low-cost air travel in Europe.

Ten European no-frills airlines today launched a new lobby group.
    The European Low Fares Airline Association (ELFAA) said it will lobby governments and authorities "to ensure 
that European policy and legislation promote free and equal competition to enable the continued growth and 
development of low fares".
 The 10 ELFAA members are: Air Berlin (Germany), Basiqair/Transavia (Netherlands), FlyBE (UK), Flying Finn 
(Finland), Hapag-Lloyd Express (Germany), Ryanair PLC (Ireland), Sky Europe (Slovakia), Sterling (Denmark), 
Sverige Flyg (Sweden) and Volareweb (Italy).
    "The members felt that legislation and pricing policies have not been taking low-fare airlines into account in the 
past," said an ELFAA statement.

Two private companies and one tourist agency have applied to run budget airlines in China, the head of the Civil 
Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) Yang Yuanyuan told reporters at a news briefing in Beijing.
    Yang said: "Some private airline companies and tourist agencies are now applying to run low-cost airlines, and 
the CAAC is about to ratify these applications."
    But the CAAC chief would not divulge the names or any details about any of the three companies, or provide a 
timeframe for the approvals. He said planning was still underway, and only after the CAAC has studied the plans 
could budget airlines be given the go-ahead.
    He also said airlines in Hong Kong and Macau had expressed interest in operating budget airlines in the 
mainland, but would not provide further details.
    Yang said there "have been a lot of discussions and trials within the industry" about these low-cost airlines.
    But he warned that budget airlines looking to operate routes in the mainland would have to reach safety 
standards set by the CAAC before they start operations.
    Asked about the CAAC's definition of a low-cost airline, he said there was still some disagreement on the issue.
    Budget airlines have become enormously popular in Europe and North America, particularly on shorter routes, 
with carriers even grabbing market share from established national flag carriers such as British Airways, Air France 
and Lufthansa.
    Southwest Airlines of the US, launched in 1971, was the first to make "no frills" budget airline services work 
profitably, discarding the "hub and spoke" business model for a "point-to-point" system that allowed them to fly 
passengers cheaply and quickly across short distances.
 In Europe, Ireland's Ryanair and the UK's Easyjet have adopted and honed the model, largely avoiding the 
financial crises that have plagued the sector in recent years -- from 9/11 to the SARS outbreak and the conflict in 
Iraq -- by consistently and aggressively cutting prices.
    In Asia, Singapore Airlines and Ryanair announced in December that they were jointly setting up Tiger Airways, 
which will begin flights from the Asian city-state next year.
    Malaysia's AirAsia is currently the most successful and longest-established no-frills carrier in the region, and 
recently expanded its international routes to Thailand.
Three companies apply to operate budget airlines in China - CAAC head
    Other regional players in the sector include Indonesia's Lion Air, which flies a bargain-bucket service from 
Jakarta to Singapore, as well as Orient Thai Airlines, Malaysia's Athena Air Services and Singapore's ValueAir, 
which plans to begin operating low-cost flights this year.

(Updating to add comments from CAAC air transport division director Li Jiangmin on companies involved)
     Two private companies and one tourist agency have applied to run budget airlines in China and the feasibility of 
their plans are now being studied, the head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) Yang Yuanyuan 
told a news briefing this morning.
    Li Jiangmin, the director general of CAAC's Air Transport Department, later told AFX-Asia that one of the 
companies is a Shanghai-based tour operator and that the other two companies were joint ventures, one with 
foreign involvement.
    He would not name the companies involved, but said the budget airlines would be start-ups and would not 
involve existing airlines.
    "We are talking about potential start-up low-cost airlines," Li said.
    Earlier at the news briefing, Yang told reporters: "Some private airline companies and tourist agencies are now 
applying to run low-cost airlines, and the CAAC is about to ratify these applications."
    But he would not name the companies or provide a timeframe for the approvals. He said planning was still 
underway, and only after the CAAC has studied the plans could budget airlines be given the go-ahead.
    Private companies in Hong Kong and Macau have also expressed interest in operating budget airlines on the 
mainland, he said, but would not provide further details.
    Yang said: "There have been a lot of discussions and trials within the industry" about these low-cost airlines.
    But he warned that any budget airline on the mainland would have to reach safety and security standards set by 
the CAAC before they could start operations.
 Asked about the CAAC's definition of a low-cost airline, he said there was still some disagreement on the issue.
    Li said talks with the companies who want to start their airlines are still ongoing and the situation is still fluid.
    "One (company) from the travel industry wants to start up a low-cost airline, but the others have more interest in 
setting up a commuter airline.  But there may be some difference between a low-cost and commuter airline so we 
do not have something in a firm picture.
    "But eventually, if they are successful, as we wish, there will be three separate applicants."

    But Li said the government will proceed with caution based on the experiences of European and North American 
countries.
    "Some airlines disappear before they even start flying, so we want to be careful."
    Budget airlines have become enormously popular in Europe and North America, particularly on shorter routes, 
with carriers even grabbing market share from established national flag carriers such as British Airways, Air France

The Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC expects to double its passenger numbers in Europe by 2010, 
according to chief executive Michael O'Leary.
    Ryanair aims to have around 50 mln passengers by 2010, compared with an anticipated 24 mln this year, 
O'Leary said on a whistle-stop three-city German tour.
    In Germany alone, the number of passengers is expected to rise to 5 mln from around 3.5 mln at present, 
O'Leary said.

---- by Fang Yan ----    
     Market rumors that China's aviation regulators could be on the verge of sanctioning the establishment of a 
budget airline sector appear to be premature, aviation analysts told AFX-Asia.
    Analysts said budget airline services had the potential to slash operating costs for domestic carriers, but added 
the caveat that the sector would only take off once the government relaxes its controls on jet fuel distribution and 
slashes import tariffs on regional aircraft.
    The South China Morning Post reported this morning that budget airlines would be launched in the mainland 
"soon" -- perhaps within the year.
    But Zhang Shouxin, an official with the public affairs department at the Civil Aviation Administration of China 
(CAAC), declined to comment on the issue, and three industry analysts contacted by AFX-Asia all deemed budget 
airlines a non-starter in the near term.
    Budget airlines have become enormously popular in Europe and North America, particularly on shorter routes, 
with carriers even grabbing market share from established national flag carriers such as British Airways, Air France 
and Lufthansa.
    Southwest Airlines of the US, launched in 1971, was the first to make "no frills" budget airline services work 
profitably, discarding the "hub and spoke" business model for a "point-to-point" system that allowed them to fly 
passengers cheaply and quickly across short distances.
    In Europe, Ireland's Ryanair and the UK's Easyjet have adopted and honed the model, largely avoiding the 
financial crises that have plagued the sector in recent years -- from 9/11 to the SARS outbreak and the conflict in 
Iraq -- by consistently and aggressively cutting prices.
 Peng Zhigang, an analyst with Southwest Securities, said that the main obstacle preventing no-frills airlines 
operating successfully in China is domestic carriers' higher jet fuel costs, and high government-imposed import 
tariffs on foreign-made small aircraft and regional jets.
    Higher oil costs may hold back the development of a domestic budget airline sector, but prices are unlikely to fall 
so long as China's retail and wholesale jet fuel distibution sectors remain controlled by the monopoly China Aviation 
Oil Supply Corp (CAOSC), parent of Singapore-listed China Aviation Oil (Singapore) Corp Ltd.
FOCUS - Budget airlines face tough future in China; Asia market has potential
    CAOSC's monopoly results in higher jet fuel expenditure for local carriers, which typically accounts for 25-30 pct 
of operating costs, against 8-12 pct for foreign airlines, said Li Lei, an analyst with China Securities.
    China's high import tariffs on small aircraft also impede the development of budget airlines in the country.
    Domestic carriers rely heavily on foreign-made regional aircraft, even though domestic aviation equipment 
makers China Aviation Industry Corp I (AVIC I) and China Aviation Industry Corp II (AVIC II) have started to 
manufacture their own small aircraft.
    The two firms have plans to launch regional jets, respectively the 70-90 seat ARJ21 and the 50-seat ERJ145, the 
latter developed jointly with Brazil's Embraer.
    But while the first ERJ 145 model rolled off the production line in December, the mass production of both jets are 
still a few years away.
    Until then, local carriers will continue to rely on imports of small aircraft, in particular from Canada's Bombardier 
and insolvent German aircraft maker Fairchild Dornier GmbH, bought last year by Chinese investor D'Long 
International Strategic Investment Co Ltd.
    To protect domestic aircraft makers, the Chinese government has been busily imposing extra tariffs on imported 
regional aircraft in recent years, creating higher operating costs for local carriers, who have had no option but to buy 
foreign.
    High operating costs have hit smaller regional carriers such as Shandong Airlines Co Ltd (SZ B 200152), which is 
losing money on inter-city routes, exactly the sort of short-haul service that provides the financial bread-and-butter 
for budget airlines the world over.
    "How could you expect the low-cost model to work in China, if (the carriers) are already losing money on non-
budget services?" said Peng Zhigang, an analyst with Southwest Securities.
    Zhang Dingjie, an analyst with Orient Securities, also backs this viewpoint, saying: "Unless the government 
relaxes its control on the jet fuel sector and slashes import tariffs of foreign-made small aircraft, the takeoff of 
Chinese budget airlines will be feasible only in theory."
    Taking a broader view of Asia's fledgling budget airline industry provides more optimism -- the sector's potential 
looks increasingly bright, with big global industry players set to expand into the region.
    Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Ryanair announced in December that they were
jointly setting up Tiger Airways, which will begin flights from the Asian city-state next year.
    Malaysia's AirAsia is currently the most successful and longest-established no-frills carrier in the region, and 
recently expanded its inter-country routes to Thailand.
    Other regional players in the sector include Indonesia's Lion Air, which flies a bargain-bucket service from 
Jakarta to Singapore, as well as Orient Thai Airlines, Malaysia's Athena Air Services and Singapore's ValueAir, 
which plans to begin operating low-cost flights this year.
    But it is the major airlines' recent push to set up budget air services in the region that have convinced analysts 
and industry players of the sector's potential going forward.
    Many major carriers, which successfully staved off competition from budget rivals in the 1980s and early 1990s, 
were left floundering when the sector finally found its wings during the tail-end of the last decade.
    They are unlikely to be caught napping again. Australia's Qantas Airways this week announced the launch of a 
new budget airline, Jetstar, to counter the success of low-cost upstart Virgin Blue, which has 28 pct share of the 
domestic market
    Flamboyant British businessman Richard Branson, who launched Virgin Blue three years ago, has said he too 
wants to enter the Asian market and is looking for partners.

Ryanair Holdings PLC's chief executive said he was concerned that the outcome of a European Union investigation 
into the no-frills airline's operations at Belgium's Charleroi airport would "devastate" low-cost air travel in Europe.
    CEO Michael O'Leary said there was nothing to change his view of last month that the long-awaited ruling by the 
European Commission would go against the Irish carrier, Europe's biggest no-frills airline.
    "We still understand, but we haven't seen this, that the draft decision is negative," he told reporters in Brussels 
after a two-day seminar organised by 27 regional airports from around the EU.
    "A negative decision here will devastate Charleroi, will be bad for consumers and bad for low-cost air travel," he 
said.
    But O'Leary added: "We still remain hopeful that the commission will formally take a decision which will be good 
for competition, which will be good for low-cost airports and good for consumers."
    The EU's executive body is finalising a probe into whether Ryanair's contract with the publicly owned airport at 
Charleroi amounts to illegal state aid.
    A decision is expected late this month or early next.
    O'Leary said last month that a negative ruling would force Ryanair to switch to another European hub, saying two 
other unidentified airports were ready to take Charleroi's place.
    But this week he played down the impact on his company's business model of an adverse judgement from the 
commission.
    "It would have no impact on Ryanair, in the same way that a negative decision in Strasbourg simply meant that 
the route got moved to Baden-Baden, where in fact we're doing better with a lower cost base," he said.
 Ryanair is appealing against a court decision in the eastern French city that barred state subsidies for its 
Strasbourg-London service, but in the meantime has switched to Baden-Baden over the German border.

- European oil firms took a hit in U.S. trading Wednesday after they were downgraded by Citigroup Smith Barney.
The Bank of New York European ADR Index closed down 1.19 points at 112.76.
Oil stocks came under pressure after the downgrades were released. Total  fell $2.78, or 3 percent, to $91.57; 
Royal Dutch  slipped $1.20 to $52.65; BP  declined $1.20 to $49.02; and Shell Transport & Trading  lost $1.20, or 3 
percent, to $44.73.
Nokia  got a nice boost after both J.P. Morgan and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein upgraded the stock. Shares of 
the Finnish wireless phone maker climbed 48 cents, to 3 percent, to $17.97.
British Airways  climbed $4.54, or 10 percent, to $48.79 after several brokers said the airline's December passenger 
data demonstrate a recovery.
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines  gained 72 cents, or 4 percent, to $17.51 after it said that December passenger load 
factor improved 3 percentage points to 77.6 percent, as an 11 percent passenger capacity decline made up for a 7 
percent fall in passenger traffic.
Irish discount airline Ryanair  added 53 cents to $51.33 after the company said December passenger load factor 
eased to 83 percent from 85 percent, while the airline reported a 53 percent rise in passengers flown, to 2 million 
from 1.3 million.
Sodexho Alliance  climbed 85 cents, or 3 percent, to $31.35 after the French catering firm said revenue for its 
quarter ending Nov. 30 rose 4.9 percent on a currency-adjusted basis. Merrill Lynch analyst Paul Steegers said the 
result was boosted by a one-time benefit from supplying the Rugby World Cup, which added 1.6 percentage points 
of growth for the quarter.
Irish pharmaceutical Elan  rose 94 cents, or 13 percent, to $8.02 after it said it expects to file an amendment to its 
new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the second quarter of 2004 for its Prialt chronic 
pain medication and bring the treatment to market no later than the first quarter of 2005.
GlaxoSmithKline  declined 87 cents to $45.85 after it received a claim for additional taxes from the IRS for $2.7 
billion that legacy company Glaxo Wellcome owes for the years 1989 to 1996 for Zantac profits. GSK said interest, 
Wall Street - European ADRs Oil stocks close lower after broker's downgrade
if the IRS succeeds in its claim, would total around $2.5 billion. GSK said it plans to contest the claim for additional

Singapore Airlines expects its business to grow 5-6 pct next year, local TV station ChannelNews Asia quoted chief 
executive officer Chew Choon Seng as saying.
    Speaking to the station and other local media, Chew also said his immediate priority is to negotiate a more 
flexible wage structure with the new leadership of the airline's pilots union.
 The union's new president, Mok Hin Choon, was elected today to replace  Dilip Padbidri.
    Chew said he wants to increase the flexible component in general staff wages to about 30 pct from 20 pct at 
present and for executives to about 40 pct from 30 pct.
    For senior management, including himself, Chew said he wants to make the flexible component 50 pct of wages 
instead of over 20 pct.
    SIA earlier this year cut wages after suffering an unprecedented 312.3 mln sgd net loss in the first quarter to 
June 2003 as passenger traffic plunged following the war in Iraq and the SARS outbreak.
    It has since rebounded to post a net profit of 305.80 mln sgd for the second quarter to September 2003.
    Chew said SIA faces intense competition from full service airlines and  identified Emirates as its biggest 
competitor.
    He said budget carriers also pose new challenges for SIA, which has set up its own budget carrier, Tiger Air, in 
partnership with parent Temasek Holdings and the founder of Ryanair.

Singapore Airlines (SIA) rebounded from its fall yesterday after the market in mid-morning trade discounted 
concerns arising from news that a Taiwanese man who had travelled to Singapore this month had contracted 
SARS, dealers said.
    Singapore authorities declared the city-state was Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) free, easing fears 
the disease had re-emerged in Singapore.
    "We are establishing the facts of the case but there are no suspect (cases) of SARS in Singapore," a health 
ministry spokeswoman told Agence France-Presse.
    In addition, Singapore authorities reacted quickly to the news, placing 70 Singaporeans who had come into 
contact with the Taiwanese man under quarantine in their homes.
    At 11.10 am, SIA was up 0.20 sgd or 1.77 pct at 11.50 sgd on volume of 724,000 shares.
    The Straits Times index was down 0.37 points at 1,723.20.
    ING Financial Markets analyst Philip Wickham, who has a 'buy' call on SIA and a price target of 14.00 sgd, said 
the recent case of SARS in Taiwan appears to be an isolated instance, and not cause for much concern.
    "It's not an outbreak. It's like that case before," Wickham said, refering to the previous isolated instance when a 
medical researcher came down with the virus in Singapore.
    The Singapore transport minister's recent announcement that budget airlines may be able to operate out of 
Singapore's Changi airport within 18 months using a new no-frills terminal also did not affect SIA's share price, 
dealers said.
    Wickham said that he did not think that allowing budget airlines to fly out of Changi Airport means that they are 
more likely to gobble SIA's market share.
 "It's going to happen anyway, even if they fly out of Seletar Airport...The low cost carriers would have preferred to 
fly out of Seletar because it's cheaper to operate there," he said.
    Singapore Airlines has also entered into a partnership with, among others, the government's investment arm 
Temasek Holdings and Europe's no-frills carrier Ryanair, to set up a budget carrier, known as Tiger Airways, which 
will begin operations from Changi Airport in the second half of 2004.

Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Irish no-frills airline, slumped after a French appeals court upheld the ban on 
subsidies it gets for its London-Strasbourg route.
    The court, in a decision announced today, backed a lower court ruling in July that considered payments by the 
chamber of commerce to Ryanair represented an improper use of public funds.
At 12.33 pm, Ryanair shares were down 0.14 at 6.40 eur, having fallen by as much as 0.24 at 6.30 eur.
    Ryanair had already been denied a request to have the Nancy court suspend its decision pending the appeal.
    Two days ago, Ryanair said it will restart low fare flights on the Strasbourg-London route at 9 eur on Jan 29 if the 
court ruled in favour of the airline.

Singapore Airlines shares lower in late trading after health authorities in Taipei said a Taiwanese man who traveled 
to Singapore earlier this month had contracted SARS, dealers said.
    At 11.55 am, SIA was down 0.30 sgd at 11.40, off a low 11.30, on volume of 1.90 mln shares.
    The Straits Times Index was down 18.66 points at 1,710.38.
    According to an Agence France Presse report, the man was working at a military medical research institute in 
Taiwan and may have contracted the virus in the laboratory during an experiment on SARS on December 5.
    The patient, a lieutenant-colonel working at the Institute of Preventive Medicine of National Defense Medical 
Center, developed a fever during the night of December 10 on returning from Singapore where he attended a 
medical seminar, the report added.
    SARS emerged in south China's Guangdong province at the end of last year and eventually struck 32 countries, 
infecting some 8,000 people and killing close to 800 before subsiding in the summer. China was the worst hit 
country, accounting for 349 fatalities and 5,327 infections.
    The SARS outbreak forced many airlines to scale down flights as passengers canceled travel plans for fear of 
contracting the disease.
    Kim Eng Securities research Seah Hing Hong said SIA has yet to restore fully its capacity to pre-SARS levels 
and another outbreak of the disease may set back its plans to do so.
    "Hopefully, this will turn out to be an isolated incident," Seah said.
 Seah said he is keeping his "hold" recommendation on SIA on concerns that the emergence of budget carriers in 
the region will constrain the airline's operating performance.
    SIA announced last week that it is, in partnership with parent Temasek Holdings and the founder of Ryanair, 
setting up a Singapore-based budget carrier to be called Tiger Airways.

No-frills carriers easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC both welcomed the government's decision to allow a 
second runway at Stansted.
    The government's aviation White Paper chose Stansted as the site for a new runway to meet the demands of 
expanding air traffic in the southeast but left the door open for a third runway at Heathrow from 2015.
 "Of all the places where a new runway could have gone in the near term in the southeast of England, Stansted is 
the most obvious choice. It is the airport that has been identified for long-term expansion and will avoid the 
constraints particular to Heathrow Airport," said Ray Webster, chief executive of Luton-based easyJet.
    Dublin-based Ryanair airline welcomed a second runway for Stansted as "good news for consumers".
    "By allowing for growth where the low fares airlines are, means millions more ordinary people can benefit from 
low fares air travel," it said.

ROUNDUP UK govt opts for second Stansted runway

Transport Secretary Alistair Darling today opted for a second runway at Stansted in Essex as the government's 
choice for the location of the south-east of England's next runway but left the door open for a third runway at 
Heathrow from 2015.
    As had been expected Darling chose Stansted over Heathrow, the home of flag carrier British Airways PLC and 
the UK's major hub, because further development of the west London airport would likely fall foul of a European 
Union directive on air quality.
    But in a move that will be seen as a sop to BA and the other traditional carriers but outrage environmentalists the 
Transport Secretary set out proposals to find ways to increase capacity at Heathrow using existing facilities.
    Stansted and Heathrow are both owned by BAA PLC.
    Outlining his White Paper on the future of air transport in the UK to Parliament, Darling said Stansted had seen 
"very substantial" growth in passengers in recent years but that if this continued at current rates the airport's 
capacity would be used up quickly.
    "A second runway at Stansted would provide very substantial runway capacity in the south-east and generate 
large economic benefits," he said.
    Darling maintained the government's case for Stansted was bolstered by the fact that the local economy is 
already set to grow strongly and further expansion of the airport would complement plans for regional economic 
development.
    "On balance, we have therefore concluded that the first new runway in the south-east should be developed as 
soon as possible at Stansted, expected to be opening around 2011 or 2012," he said.
 His decision was warmly welcomed by no-frills carriers Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC, who both have 
expanding operations at Stansted.
    Darling acknowledged there was a strong case for a third runway at Heathrow, but this had to be reconciled with 
the "difficult issue" of keeping air quality and noise levels at an acceptable level at the airport -- a situation further 
complicated by a mandatory EU requirement on air pollution from 2010.
    He said the government believes "there is a substantially better prospect of achieving this condition" between 
2015 and 2020 "provided that we take action now to tackle the nitrogen dioxide problem."
ROUNDUP UK govt opts for second Stansted runway
    "We will therefore institute immediately with the airport operator and relevant bodies and agencies a programme 
of action to consider how these conditions can be met to enable the addition of a third runway," Darling said.
    The White Paper also set out proposals to find ways to increase capacity at Heathrow using existing facilities -- 
effectively a review of the rules prohibiting the simultaneous use of Heathrow's two existing runways.
    Currently Heathrow has to alternate its two runways each day, using one for take-offs and one for landings.
    As an insurance for Heathrow failing to meet the conditions for a third runway the government plans to safeguard 
land for a second runway at Gatwick, also owned by BAA. This cannot be built before 2019 under an existing 
agreement with local authorities in the area.
    BAA welcomed the White Paper.
    "Aviation is vital to the economic and social well-being of the UK and we are pleased that the government has 
taken such a long-sighted, strategic view," said chief executive Mike Clasper.
    It said it would "press ahead" with the development of Stansted and "work urgently" to resolve the air pollution 
issues at Heathrow. This will require action on motor vehicle emissions, as well as aircraft and airport ground 
vehicles.
    BA, which along with Virgin Atlantic had threatened legal action if Heathrow was frozen out in the White Paper, 
said it was pleased Darling acknowledged the strong case Heathrow has for further expansion.
    "We congratulate the government on recognising the enormous benefits that a third runway at London Heathrow 
airport will bring to Britain," said chief executive Rod Eddington.
    "For the first time, we have an effective forward-looking aviation policy which recognises Heathrow's key role as 
Britain's main gateway airport."
    The BA chief said the company will work with the government and local authorities to establish an immediate 
programme of action that addresses the environmental issues at Heathrow.
    Darling also backed proposals to make best use of other existing runways in the south-east, including 
development to maximise capacity of a full length single runway at Luton airport, owned and run by TBI PLC.
    TBI did not call for a second runway at Luton because it does not believe it will generate greater economic 
benefit and instead would like to see the existing runway lengthened. This view is supported by the government 
conditional on controls on environmental impact.
    The government rejected outright the option of building a new airport for the south-east at Cliffe in Kent and 
proposals for a brand new site between Coventry and Rugby in the Midlands.
    But acknowledging that traffic in the Midlands is set to grow, the government supported the case for a second 
runway at Birmingham, expected to be built by 2016, and expansion of traffic within existing resources at East 
Midlands airport.
    Turning to Scotland, the government plans to set aside land at Edinburgh and Glasgow airports for possible new 
runways and terminal expansion.
    In the south-west the government backed a runway extension and new terminal at Bristol Airport but rejected the 
option of a new airport north of Bristol.
    Darling decided against increasing Air Passenger Duty (APD) from its current rate of 5 stg per passenger for 
flights to UK and continental European destinations. Instead he said the government will press for an EU-wide 
emissions trading scheme to address the impact of aviation greenhouse gases.
    The Stock Market's reaction to the widely leaked White Paper was muted. BAA closed down 2 pence at 472-1/4, 
while BA was down 1-3/4 pence at 227-1/2.
    TBI closed unchanged at 68-1/2 pence, Ryanair was down 5 cents at 6.42 eur and easyJet was down 1/2 pence 
at 284-1/2.

Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways is evaluating plans to set up a low-cost airline subsidiary as it reviews options 
on how to deal with the region's increasing interest in budget travel, a newspaper report said.
    The recent flurry of low-cost start-ups in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand has led Hong Kong's flag-
carrier to reassess its operations, Cathay Pacific corporate development director Tony Tyler told the South China 
Morning Post.
 "We will do something to respond to what is going on in the market. (Launching a low cost carrier) is just one of the 
options we are looking at -- but it is too early to say what we will go for," Tyler said.
    Rival Singapore Airlines (SIA) is the latest regional carrier to jump aboard the no-frills bandwagon, joining forces 
with the founder of successful European budget airline Ryanair to set up Tiger Airways, scheduled to start flying in 
the second half of 2004.
    Tiger Airways will compete against AirAsia of Malaysia, currently the most successful no-frills carrier in Southeast 
Asia, with competition set to hot up when Valuair takes to the skies by the second quarter of 2004.

UK blue chips hovered fractionally below opening levels in very dull trade midafternoon, with gains from a firm 
opening performance on Wall Street following a batch of mixed US data offset by some disappointing blue chip 
trading statements, dealers said.
    At 3.09 pm, the FTSE 100 index was 0.5 points lower at 4,347.5, well off an opening low of 4,331.4 but unable to 
reach back to a post-Wall Street open peak of 4,351.0.
    All the broader FTSE indices remained weaker, with the FTSE 250 index the worst off -- down 47.4 points at 
5,666.9.
    Volume was moderate, with 1.76 bln shares changing hands in 143,014 transactions.
    In early trade on Wall Street, the DJIA bounced 56.30 points higher to 10,079.10 recovering after a late sell-off 
yesterday, but the Nasdaq composite index only managed to add 1.68 points to 1,919.94.
    Traders in New York had a mixed batch of US economic data to digest today, with US inflation proving tamer-
than-expected but US industrial production stronger-than-expected in November.
    Earlier today, the latest UK inflation figures showed a bigger than expected drop last month under the new CPI 
reading.
    On the corporate news front, airport and airline issues were in focus midafternoon following the lunchtime 
publication of the Government White Paper on the expansion of air traffic in the UK.
    As expected, transport secretary Alastair Darling announced that the government has chosen BAA's Stansted 
airport as the site for a second runway to meet the demands of expanding air traffic in the southeast of the country.
 However, the government rejected calls for a third runway in the near future at BAA's flagship London Heathrow 
airport, said the transport secretary.
    In reaction to the unsurprising news, shares in BAA fell back 1-3/4 pence to 477-3/4 although the airport operator 
officially welcomed the news.
    Meanwhile Luton airport owner and operator TBI saw its shares ease back 0-1/4 pence to 68-1/4. TBI has 
threatened legal action if Luton airport was frozen out of the White Paper.
London shares stay fractionally lower midafternoon; New York up, data mixed
    And some airline groups expressed disappointment at the limited runway expansion, with British Airways losing 
2-1/2 pence to 225-3/4, while Ryanair shed 0.7 eur at 6.40 as Germany's TUI confirmed the launch of a new UK 
'no-frills' airline today, to be called Thomsonfly.
    But Easyjet managed to edge up 0-1/2 pence to 285-1/2, relieved by the lack of a feared hike in Air Passenger 
Duty, which some commentators said could have accompanied the runway expansion moves.
    Elsewhere, online travel companies were big mid cap casualties midafternoon, reflecting the limited UK air traffic 
expansion plans as well as fading sub-sector bid hopes. Lastminute.com shares shed 15-1/2 pence at 215, while 
Ebookers lost 13 pence at 390.
    Meanwhile, the tech sector remained under pressure, hit by a profit warning from French IT consultancy Cap 
Gemini this morning.
    The French news unsettled investors and overshadowed better-than-expected results from database group 
Oracle after-hours in the US last night. Oracle shares moved higher today.
    Blue chip Sage Group traded 2-1/4 pence lower to 173-1/4, while second liner LogicaCMG lost 7-1/4 pence at 
255-3/4, and Misys shed 10 pence at 281 ahead of a trading update from the software firm due midday tomorrow.
    Otherwise a batch of trading updates from blue chip companies continued to attract attention.
    FT publisher Pearson remained a big blue chip faller, losing 19-1/4 pence at 611 as the market digested a rather 
uninspiring trading update.
    The group guided investors towards lower revenue growth of 4-6 pct at its US college business next year and 
stuck to earlier guidance of 5-7 pct revenue growth for its US Higher Education business.
    Fellow media blue chip was weak in sympathy, losing 6-3/4 pence at 229.
    Packaging blue chip Bunzl was also weak in the wake of an unexciting trading update today, with its shares 
losing 3-1/2 pence at 420-1/4.
    Bunzl said its overall results for 2003 will be in line with market expectations after taking account of the effect of 
the weak dollar.
    Elsewhere, blue chip mortgage bank HBOS continued to be knocked by profit-taking after the firm's pretty 
encouraging trading statement this morning.
    The bank confirmed that full-year results are on target to meet market consensus. HBOS shares dropped 13-1/2 
pence to 704-1/2.
    The rest of the financial sector remained mixed, with Alliance & Leicester losing 2-1/2 pence at 888, while Abbey 
National shedding 1-1/4 pence at 528.
    But LloydsTSB managed to stay 4 pence higher at 420 after the bank's own update yesterday prompted JP 
Morgan to upgrade its rating to 'neutral' from 'overweight'.
    Elsewhere on the upside, sentiment in the tobacco sector improved  following the hefty losses yesterday on news 
of the OFT's probe of the industry for possible price fixing, helped by Gallaher's in-line trading statement.
    Gallaher confirmed that current trading remains in line with expectations. In response, Gallaher shares added 7-
1/2 pence at 590, while Imperial Tobacco shares gained 24 pence at 1,080.
    UK brokers reassured investors that yesterday's sell-off in the tobacco sector was overdone and the impact on 
Imperial Tobacco and Gallaher will be minimal.
    GKN was another firm blue chip feature midafternoon, adding 2-1/4 pence at 259-3/4 after the automotive and 
aerospace engineering group said it expects its full-year results to be in line with current market expectations.
    And news of management changes helped Whitbread shares take on 8 pence at 714, with the hotel and leisure 
group appointing Alan Parker as its new chief executive.
London shares stay fractionally lower midafternoon; New York up, data mixed
    Meanwhile, positive broker comment sent shares in National Grid Transco 7-1/2 pence higher to 392-3/4, with 
Dresdner Kleinwort upgrading the group to 'add' from 'hold', the first time it has been positive on the stock.
    And 3i Group shares took on 5-1/4 pence to 599 after UBS turned buyer of the stock today, upgrading from 
'neutral'.
    On the second line, Carpetright remained the best performer, jumping 38 pence higher to 804 after releasing 
better-than-expected interim results and giving an upbeat outlook for the second half.
    Fellow furnishings retailer MFI Furniture benefited in sympathy, adding 5-1/4 pence at 137-3/4.
    Davis Service Group shares were also in demand, gaining 14-3/4 pence at 358-1/4 after the group this morning 
announced the sale of HSS, its tool hire business, for 145 mln stg.
    In response, Oriel Securities upgraded its stance on David Service to 'add' from 'reduce'
    Meanwhile housebuilder Persimmon took on 8-1/2 pence at 477-1/2 after a reassuring trading update. The 
company said results for the current financial year will exceed current market forecasts.
    Premier Oil shares advanced 7 pence higher to 440 after news of the drilling of a successful well in the 
Chinguettti field in Mauritania.
    And Interserve continued to move higher, up 3-3/4 pence higher at 255 after its Interserve Project Services won a 
contract worth 13 mln stg to design and construct new facilities as well as refurbish existing buildings at Friarage 
Hospital in North Yorkshire.
    But on the downside with mid caps, shares in FKI were under pressure after news debt ratings group Moody's 
has put the engineering firm on 'CreditWatch' with a view to downgrading to junk status.

     Leading shares closed weaker today, ending just above late session lows as Wall Street put in a mixed

Thomson Holidays, owned by Germany's TUI AG, said it will
launch a new low-fare airline "Thomsonfly.com" on March 31, based at Coventry Airport.
    Thomsonfly.com will run direct services from Coventry to 10 European
destinations: Palma, Valencia, Rome, Naples, Nice, Malaga, Venice, Pisa,
Ibiza, Marseilles and Jersey.
 One-way fares will start at stg 17.99 to Jersey, stg 19.99 to Rome, Pisa,
Venice, Nice and Marseilles, stg 22.99 to Naples, Valencia, Palma and Ibiza and
stg 24.99 to Malaga, inclusive of taxes and charges.
    Aircraft and flight staff will be supplied by Britannia Airways, also owned
by TUI, and TUI Airline Management will be responsible for aircraft procurement.
    Thomson said the new airline will create around 200 new jobs in its first
year of operation.
    "The growth in this market has been driven by an increased demand for
self-planned and flight only breaks. Thomson expects this growth to continue and
forecasts a further 50 pct growth over the next four years."
    "Coventry Airport's position in the heart of England makes it the ideal base
for the new services being launched by Thomsonfly.com with over 15 mln
people living within a two hour drive," it said.
    Chris Mottershead, managing director of TUI UK said: "The travel market is
changing as we see trends towards self-packaging, shorter breaks and a
demand for greater flexibility. We want to take advantage of the huge growth
TUI 's Thomson to launch new budget airline in UK, create 200 jobs
in the flight only business using the power of the Thomson brand and build a
business that caters for all our customers' leisure travel needs."    
    TUI already operates budget carrier Hapag-Lloyd Express from Germany.

Travel portal Asiatravel.com Holdings Ltd was lower on profit-taking in early morning trade, in line with the broader 
market, even though the company said the emergence of budget airlines in Asia should have a positive impact on 
its on-line travel booking operations, dealers said.
    Asiatravel was down 0.005 sgd or 1.053 pct at 0.47.
 There are two budget carriers emerging in Singapore -- Valuair, which is partly owned by Asiatravel.com, and Tiger 
Airways, which is jointly owned by Singapore Airlines, parent Temasek Holdings and the founder of Ryanair.
    In Malaysia, budget carrier AirAsia is now preparing to expand into regional routes after initially offering domestic

Travel portal Asiatravel.com Holdings Ltd was lower on profit-taking in early morning trade, in line with the broader 
market, even though the company said the emergence of budget airlines in Asia should have a positive impact on 
its on-line travel booking operations, dealers said.
    Asiatravel was down 0.005 sgd or 1.053 pct at 0.47.
 There are two budget carriers emerging in Singapore -- Valuair, which is partly owned by Asiatravel.com, and Tiger 
Airways, which is jointly owned by Singapore Airlines, parent Temasek Holdings and the founder of Ryanair.
    In Malaysia, budget carrier AirAsia is now preparing to expand into regional routes after initially offering domestic 
flights.

    "This market stimulation will benefit not only the short-range haul but also the medium to long-range airline trips.

-- Daryl Loo --
     National carrier Singapore Airlines' (SIA) long-awaited decision to launch its own budget airline is largely a 
defensive measure to protect its share of the short-haul flights market, analysts said.
    While analysts, AFX-Asia spoke to, felt it was too early to tell what kind of financial impact the investment would 
have on SIA -- in part because the airline provided scant details in that regard -- they agreed it should not be 
significant regarding SIA's asset levels.
    SIA announced yesterday that it has formed a partnership to set up a budget airline, to be named Tiger Airways, 
which will begin operations out of Changi Airport in the second half of next year.
    The national carrier plans to take a 49.0 pct stake in the venture, with the government's investment arm Temasek 
Holdings taking 11.0 pct, Irelandia Investment Ltd, the holding company of European no-frills carrier Ryanair, taking 
16.0 pct and US-based investment firm Indigo Partners 24.0 pct.
    OCBC Securities analyst Jesvinder Sandhu said not enough details were provided to allow a judgment to be 
formed on whether SIA's move is positive or negative, although she feels SIA had "little choice but to proceed with a 
budget carrier, given the growing competition from existing and potential new players".
    In a research report, ING Financial Markets regional aviation analyst Philip Wickham viewed SIA's decision to 
form the no-frills alternative as a move to protect its market share.
    "This is nothing new. We view the development as a defensive strategy by SIA to protect its market share to and 
from Singapore on short-haul flights," Wickham said.
 "If low-cost carriers are going to cannibalize a portion of SIA's short-haul network, an associate of SIA should be 
involved, rather than ValuAir or AirAsia," he added.
    AirAsia is the Malaysian budget carrier, which has been trying to win approval to fly out of Singapore, and Valuair 
is another Singapore carrier, formed by a former SIA executive, which plans to start operations next May.
    Financially, SIA's investment in Tiger is not expected to cause a strain on the company's resources, analysts 
said.
    "It is … too early to assess the financial impact on SIA at this stage but we do not expect start-up losses to be 
material, relative to the profits of the SIA Group," GK Goh analyst Teo Hiang Boon said.
FOCUS - Singapore Air planned budget carrier seen as defensive move
    Meanwhile, ING estimates that the investment required from SIA is modest, and may be less than 50.0 mln sgd, 
meaning that any potential revision to its forecasts for the company will be minor.
    OCBC's Sandhu added that "this deal will not stretch SIA's financials given its net gearing of only 10.0 pct."
    Kim Eng Securities head of research Seah Hiang Hong said that while SIA's decision to launch a budget carrier 
space was largely expected, "the surprise here is that they're taking just 49.0 pct stake."
    "It seems they want Tiger Airways to be independent from SIA," he said, adding that this may turn out to be a 
good move since some European airlines that have tried to do both - that is, run a premium airline along with a 
budget carrier - have failed.
    In his research note, GK Goh's Teo agrees with that view and believes "SIA has made the right choice by taking 
an associate stake and bringing in partners who have experience in (the) no-frills airline business model."
    Ireland's Ryanair is seen as one of the most successful budget airlines, and SIA is hoping to emulate its business 
model by bringing in Charlie Clifton, Ryanair's former director of operations, to set up Tiger Airways.
    However, opinions differ as to the impact another carrier will have on SIA's own flight services, particularly those 
of its regional unit SilkAir.
    SIA CEO Chew Choon Seng, who had earlier ruled out the possibility of transforming SilkAir into a budget airline, 
said yesterday that Tiger Airways will fly to destinations within four hours of its home base Singapore, almost the 
same time it takes SilkAir to fly to some of its current regional locations such as Langkawi in Malaysia, Seim Reap 
in Cambodia and Cebu in the Philippines.
    OCBC's Sandhu said the launch of Tiger will have a negative impact on SilkAir's revenue as Tiger Airways may 
fly the same routes.
    "It's not possible to run away from the new service eating in on either SilkAir or Singapore Airlines' revenues. 
There are not that many routes in the region," Kim Eng's Seah said.
    Wickham of ING was not concerned, saying, "It is unlikely that SilkAir and Tiger Airways will fly the same routes. 
SilkAir flies mainly to secondary destinations in Asia."
    On the other hand, likely destinations for Tiger Airways to operate are between Singapore and popular locations 
like Bali, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Manila and Phuket, Wickham said.
    "It's more likely there will be some impact on Singapore Airlines rather than SilkAir," he added.

Share prices are expected to open lower after Wall Street's losses overnight, but Singapore Airlines is expected to 
be in focus  after the company announced a partnership to start a new budget airline, dealers said.
    Yesterday, the Straits Times Index closed down 7.97 points at 1,711.36, off an intraday high of 1,726.08 and a 
low of 1,709.98.
 Volume reached 369.49 mln shares worth 376.84 mln sgd.
    Gainers led decliners 187 to 100 with 342 stocks unchanged.
    A dealer at a foreign brokerage firm said that he expects the market to return to normal after the US FOMC 
meeting overnight.
    "I think the selling should be done. I don't see any dark clouds in the
immediate future," the dealer said.
    However, the index will now return to tracking Wall Street's trends, he added.
    Singapore Airlines may gain after it said it has entered into a partnership with, among others, the government's 
investment arm Temasek Holdings and Europe's no-frills carrier Ryanair, to set up a budget carrier which will begin

    SIA said it will take a 49.0 pct in the budget airline, known as Tiger Airways, which will fly to destinations in 
Southeast Asia.
    Shares of real estate investment trust (REIT) CapitaMall Trust (CMT) may fall after it said it is issuing 45.0 mln 
new units at 1.33 sgd per unit to finance a 58.0 mln sgd investment in a private retail property fund, CapitaRetail 
Singapore.

Singapore Airlines (SIA) shares were flat midmorning after the national carrier said yesterday that it had formed a 
partnership to set up a budget airline, dealers said.
    SIA said the budget airline, to be named Tiger Airways and in which the national carrier will take a 49.0 pct stake, 
will begin operations out of Changi Airport in the second half of next year.
    However, analysts AFX-Asia spoke to feel it is too early to judge the merits of the move as SIA has not provided 
any financial information related to the investment.
    At 10.25 am, SIA was flat at 11.90 with 470,000 shares traded.
    The Straits Times Index was down 3.80 points at 1,707.56.
    SIA said Tiger Airways which will fly to destinations in Southeast Asia.
    Government investment arm Temasek Holdings has taken an 11 pct in Tiger, Irelandia Investment Ltd, holding 
company of European no-frills carrier Ryanair, 16 pct and US-based investment firm Indigo Partnets 24 pct.
    OCBC Securities analyst Jesvinder Sandhu said there are not enough details made available to judge SIA's 
move as being either positive or negative.
    In a research note, she said SIA "has little choice but to proceed with a budget carrier, given the growing 
competition from existing and potential new players." 
    The deal is not expected to stretch SIA's financials, however, given the company's net gearing of only 10 pct, she 
said. 
    "We are maintaining our 'market perform' rating with fair value pegged at 12.80 sgd," Sandhu said.
 She added there is a possible negative impact on SIA regional subsidiary SilkAir's revenue, as Tiger Airways may 
fly the same routes.
    SIA chief executive officer Chew Choon Seng said yesterday Tiger Airways will fly to destinations within four 
hours of home base Singapore. SilkAir flies to regional locations, such as Langkawi in Malaysia, Seim Reap in 
Cambodia and Cebu in the Philippines.
    ING Financial Markets regional aviation analyst Philip Wickham said it is  unlikely that SilkAir and Tiger Airways

    "SilkAir flies mainly to secondary destinations in Asia. We expect Tiger Airways to serve cities like Bangkok and

    "It's more likely there will be some impact on Singapore Airline rather than SilkAir," he added.
    However, Wickham said he is maintaining a "buy" call on the stock with a fair value of 14.00 sgd as he sees 
SIA's move as a defensive strategy to protect its short-haul network from other budget airlines, such as Malaysia's 
AirAsia and Singapore's ValuAir.

The future of Asia's fledgling budget airline industry is looking increasingly bright with the entry of big players, but 
massive European-style price cuts are unlikely, analysts said.
    Singapore Airlines (SIA) and the founder of successful European budget airline Ryanair became the latest to 
stake their claim with an announcement yesterday of their coming together to set up Tiger Airways, which will start 
flying from the city-state next year.
    Malaysia's AirAsia is currently the best established and most successful no-frills carrier in the region and 
expanded its intra-country routes to Thailand on Monday.
    Other players in the industry include Indonesia's Lion Air, which flies a no-frills service from Jakarta to Singapore, 
Orient Thai Airlines, Malaysia's Athena Air Services and Singapore's ValueAir, which expects to start flights next 
year.
    However, it is the major airlines' recent rush to set up no-frills services that analysts and industry players believe 
has confirmed the future of low-cost carriers in Asia, which will lead to stronger competition.
    Aside from SIA and Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, Australia's Qantas Airways this week named its new budget 
airline, Jetstar, to counter the success of low-cost upstart Virgin Blue, which has 28 pct share of the domestic 
market.
    Flamboyant British businessman Richard Branson, who launched Virgin Blue three years ago, has said he too 
wants to enter the Asian market and is looking for partners.
    Peter Harbison, the Sydney-based managing director of the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation, told the Agence 
France Presse news agency he is "extremely bullish" on the future of the region's low-cost airline industry, 
especially following the announcement of Tiger Airways' establishment.
 "I think this significantly steps up the level of competition and the  importance of this type of model in the region," 
Harbison said.
    "The low carrier model works best in… the short-haul point-to-point market, where pricing is extremely important 
and the deciding factor is price."
    Jimmy Lau, a spokesman for Singapore's ValueAir, also said SIA's decision to set up a no-frills airline will ease 
concerns there are too many obstacles for budget carriers to succeed in Asia.
Asia's budget airline industry lifts off, but no Europe-type prices - analysts
    "More importantly for us internally, what SIA is doing has validated our business model. It means the model can 
work in Asia," he said.
    Some of the reasons previously cited for Asia being unable to replicate the European no-frills success include the 
relatively long distance of the routes and the lack of cheap alternative airports away from the main ones.
    Europe is also regarded as having a far bigger surplus of pilots that drives the cost of salaries down and Asia 
does not have a common market.
    Hong Kong-based ING Financial Markets aviation analyst Philip Wickham said these factors mean passengers in 
Asia are unlikely to enjoy the ultra-cheap flights available in Europe, where tickets can sometimes cost less than a 
pint of beer.
    "I think you will see some cheaper flights (in Asia), but you may not see anything dramatic," Wickham said.
    He also pointed out the lack of a common market means it is highly unlikely a budget airline will be able to 
operate as a pan-Asian service.
    Instead, Wickham said the low-cost airlines in Asia will generally only be able to fly routes that begin or end at 
their own airport.
    Nevertheless, passengers can expect to pay hundreds of dollars less for many popular destinations that no-frills 
airlines currently do not serve, analysts said.
    For example, Wickham said Tiger Airways' destinations will include Bali, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Manila 
and Phuket.

Singapore Airlines said it has entered into a partnership with, among others, the government's investment arm 
Temasek Holdings and Europe's no-frills carrier Ryanair, to set up a budget carrier which will begin operations from 
Changi Airport in the second half of 2004.
    SIA said it will take a 49.0 pct in the budget airline, known as Tiger Airways, which will fly to destinations in 
Southeast Asia.
    Indigo Partners LLC, the aviation partnership of David Bonderman and Bill Franke and Irelandia Investments Ltd, 
the Ryan family's investment vehicle are the other partners in Tiger Airways, SIA said.
    "Singapore Airlines and Temasek will own a majority of the new airline, but Tiger will be separately certificated 
and operated independently by a team specially recruited for the low cost airline," SIA said in a statement.
    "Tiger has engaged Charlie Clifton, former director of operations at Ryanair, to establish the base in Singapore 
and to set up outstations throughout South East Asia over the coming months," it added.
    In a speech to staff, SIA chief executive officer Chew Choon Seng said the capital structure for the new airline is 
being determined and it will have borrowings.
    "(But) the SIA investment in it is likely to be immaterial relative to SIA's asset base," Chew said.
    SIA also said Tiger will operate a substantial fleet of single type, narrow body aircraft but no firm decision has yet 
been made on aircraft types.
    SIA's Chew said in his speech that the airline decided to set up a low-cost carrier after studying the growth of low 
fare airlines in US and Europe.
 "Our conclusion is that it can succeed here as well. It will open up and serve a new segment of the market making 
air travel accessible for more people and encouraging more trips," Chew said.
    "It will complement SIA's premium service and product offering and SilkAir's regional operations," he said.
    He added that SIA has decided not to operate Tiger as a wholly-owned subsidiary in the light of the unsuccessful 
attemps by almost all full service network airlines that had tried to operate wholly-owned low fare carriers.
    Chew also told staff that SIA remains committed to growing its full service network airline and its regional arm 
SilkAir.

    "I want to emphasise that we will continue to build and grow SIA's success as a premium full service  network 
airline through product innovation, route expansion and an unwavering focus on customer service," Chew said.
    "Likewise, we will grow SilkAir as SIA's regional wing, as both serve quite different market segments from that of 
the new airline," he added.

An appeals court in Nancy said it will announce before the end of this year its ruling on an appeal lodged by Ryanair 
Holding PLC against the court's decision to prevent it from receiving subsidies for its London-Strasbourg route.
    The court ruled in July that subsidies received by the low-cost carrier from the Strasbourg Chamber of 
Commerce, used to purchase advertising space, amounted to illegal aid.
 Ryanair had already been denied a request to have the Nancy court suspend its decision pending the appeal.
    Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he is "very hopeful" about the outcome of the ruling.
    "We believe the court supports low fares. Flying must be for everybody. We are fighting for the low fares 
revolution," he said after the court's announcement.

If an opportunity comes up to increase it, I'm sure we'll look at it very seriously," Ryan said.
    But he added that he is currently not in any discussions to raise his shareholding in Tiger.
    The Ryan family investment vehicle Irelandia Investments Ltd now has a 16 pct stake in Tiger Airways.
    However, Ryan declined to provide the value of his investment in Tiger.
    Tiger Airways is 49 pct-owned by Singapore Airlines, 11 pct by government investment arm Temasek Holdings 
and 24 pct by Indigo Partners LLC.
    According to Ryan, the partners have come to an agreement that Tiger "has to be majority owned by local 
people".

Defence contractor and aircraft maintenance company ST Engineering's aerospace arm said it is in a good position

We expect Valuair to award the contract as early as the first quarter of next year," unit Singapore Technologies 
Aerospace's head of corporate communications, Audrey Tan, said.
    However, ST Aerospace is not in talks with Valuair currently, but, given the company's track record with low cost 
carriers like Malaysia's AirAsia and Ireland's no-frills carrier Ryanair Holdings Plc, it is in good stead to win the 
contract, Tan said.
    Instead, ST Aerospace is in talks with Indonesian budget carrier Lion Air and another European low-cost carrier 
easyJet Plc for contracts to service their aircraft.
    "We are strategically located in Singapore to service the region and the world and we are also the largest 
independent MRO (Maintanence, Repair and Overhaul service provider)," she added.

SAS to slash costs, divest noncore ops

Scandinavian Airline Systems AB chief executive Joergen Lindegaard said the group is to divest noncore units and 
slash costs in its bid to become a 'low service - low price' operator, reported Dagens Industri.
    Lindegaard said the company's IT operations will soon be sold, after which it may focus on divesting its hotel 
division.
    "The hotels are noncore activites for SAS. It does add a value to the SAS-group but when the timing is right we 
can imagine selling out or putting the hotel-group on the stock market", said Lindegaard, according to Dagens 
Industri.
    In a further bid to increase competitiveness Lindegaard said SAS is to raise the daily flight time of its aircraft to 
8.5 hours a day, from the current 7.5 hours.    
    "We don't have any choice. We have to cut prices so that we can have low service and low prices within 
Skandinavia," said Lindegaard.
    Lindegaard added however that SAS does not intend to fully mimic the Ryanair model and will remain 'full service 
airline', and a service that provide for basic levels of customer comfort. As such, he expects SAS to continue 
charging a premium relative to Ryanair.
    "Ryanair has a product model which isn't comfortable for passengers. Amongst other things (it has) airports that 
are far away from the cities,
and un-civilised (departure and arrival) times. We adjust our product to demand, we fly during peak-times, we 
handle luggage, and transfer and a lot of other things.
Therefore we charge more", said Lindegaard.
    Lindegaard said SAS will be examining all other ways of sharpening its activities and increase revenue streams. 
He said it is currently mulling charging passengers for credit card payments - just as Ryanair does, reported 
Dagens Industri.

Virgin Express Holdings PLC said it posted a "very modest" net profit of 1.68 mln eur in the third quarter, down 63 
pct from a year earlier.
    The company blamed the result, which it said is equivalent to 2.5 eur per passenger, on a combination of 
overcapacity resulting in unusually low fares, and on state subsidies which it considers illegal, said the group's 
chairman David Hoare, citing the example of Ryanair Holdings PLC.
 Sales for the period fell 8 pct to 62.07 mln eur from 67.5 mln a year earlier, mainly due to a 52 pct decline in its 
charter activities, it said.
    Sales on regular flights fell 6 pct due to the "continuing economic slowdown".
    Operating profit totalled 1.87 mln eur, down from 4.45 mln. Costs during the period fell 5 pct to 60.19 mln eur 
from 63.05 the previous year, however.

The government's draft Gambling Bill is due to be published tomorrow, outlining its plans to open up the casino 
market and establish the Gambling Commission as the industry's new regulator, officials said.
    The draft bill, which contains most of the government's proposals, will undergo pre-legislative scrutiny by a joint 
committee of both houses of parliament.
    A full Bill will then be introduced as soon as parliamentary time becomes available.
    Designed to modernise all laws relating to betting in Britain, the Bill will give the Gambling Commission, the 
planned successor to the Gaming Board, wider functions, greater flexibility to act and stronger enforcement powers.
    The first clauses of the draft Bill were published earlier this year.
    The Commission will have flexibility to impose general or individual conditions on classes of licences and, where 
necessary, on specific operators.
    It will also have powers to review licences, for example where it believes conditions have been breached or 
where it believes the licence holder is no longer suitable.
    Big players from the US are waiting in the wings to move into the market when the Bill finally becomes law.
    Harrah's Entertainment Inc has formed a joint venture with Gala Group to spend up to 1 bln stg to develop as 
many as eight new casinos.
    Blackpool, in the northwest, has been identified as a key site for casino expansion where operators hope to turn it 
into a Las Vegas style centre for hotels with casinos.
 If the current casino regulations are relaxed, including rules on size and membership, Harrah's and Gala will put 
together a "distribution network" of up to eight regional casinos, each having 30,000 to 50,000 square feet of 
gaming space among other entertainment and dining features.
    Harrahs CEO Gary Loveman said this year his compnay is proceeding on the rough assumption that each casino 
could generate about 100 mln usd in revenues per year.
    However, he called this estimate "highly speculative" and cautioned that it will depend both on how the 
regulations are changed and on what kind of competition ultimately takes shape.
    Budget air carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC also launched a service to Blackpool from Stansted airport in Essex in 
March.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Dublin-based budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, has asked to meet UK 
government Transport Secretary Alistair Darling in a bid to ward off a potentially damaging ruling by the European 
Commission on the airlines use of Belgium airport Charleroi.
    "We requested a meeting with Alistair Darling last week," O'Leary told reporters at a news conference.
    The move is part of Ryanair's lobbying of European governments to enlist support ahead of the commission's 
ruling on subsidies received by Ryanair at Charleroi.
    Recent press reports suggest the commission will decide the 25-year commercial deal included unlawful state 
aid.
    If it goes against Ryanair it will mean higher fares and reduced competition and impact other publicly-owned 
airports and low-cost airlines in Europe, said O'Leary.
    "There is no doubt that a draft decision is floating around that rules a sigificant part of our cost base at Charleroi 
represents state aid and therefore those costs should go up and fares should go up massively," he said.
    "I have not seen the decision. I don't know what is in it," he added.
    Ryanair has a range of options it can take, depending on what the commission decides, said O'Leary.
    They range from negotiating with the Commission to closing its base at Charleroi and appealing the decision, he 
added.
    "Until we know what is in the decision we don't have a clue what the negative impact is going to be," said 
O'Leary.
    If the commission rules against Ryanair, O'Leary said it would represent a victory for the powerful lobby of high-
fare airlines like Air France and high cost airports such as Zaventem.
 "Its their last desperate gasp to bring in the lobbyist and lawyers," said O'Leary.
    The commission has been investigating for a year what it claims could be illegal state subsidies like reduced 
landing charges and financial help in marketing, staff training and recruitment received by Ryanair.
    EU transport commissioner Loyola de Palacio is expected to rule by the end of this month or in early December.

    MARKET SENTIMENT
    -The broad market is expected to open lower, depressed by Friday's losses on Wall Street and sharp declines on 
the Tokyo exchange, with blue chips like Telefonica, SCH and BBVA, as well as TMTs like Sogecable under 
pressure.
 "With the Nikkei below the key 10,000 level and the dollar weakening, we'll be lower at the opening and I'd be 
looking to sell into any bounce, though the odds of any are limited," a trader at a local brokerage said.
    -FCC is likely to be well bid on reports that shareholder Esther Koplowitz is seeking to buy Veolia Environment's 
26 pct of the Spanish constructor for 960 mln eur, in a move which would give the businesswoman control as well 
open the company up to a merger.
    The report said Veolia is expected to seek a higher price than the 28 eur per share Koplowitz has offered, while 
the most likely merger candidates are Acciona, which recently bought 8.6 pct of FCC, and Ferrovial.
    "The report should add a bit of heat to the sector as such a move would open the door to further consolidation, 
but I can't see Veolia settling for less than 30 eur a share and will probably be asking for more," the trader said.
    -Other defensives like Altadis should outperform as investors focus on less risky plays.
    -Sol Melia will also be in focus ahead of the hotel group's nine months results, while Arcelor is likely to see some 
profit-taking after Friday's over 5 pct gain.

Ryanair Holdings PLC is facing fresh investigation from the European Commission, this time addressing the no-frills 
carrier's deals with little-used airports across Europe, the Business newspaper reported citing industry sources.
 The EU has been asked to investigate all present and future tie-ups between low-cost carriers and state-aided 
secondary airports near primary hubs that receive no government aid, the newspaper said.
    The probe was requested by an unnamed aviation company.
    Both the EU and Ryanair declined to comment, the article said.

Former EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said he hopes the European Commission will take a 
"balanced" decision on the case of budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC's use of Charleroi airport near Brussels but 
warned it is likely to end up in the European Court of Justice anyway.
    "We must hope the decision is sufficiently balanced" to show the Commission will not tolerate illegal state aid on 
the one hand, but on the other that is not out to "make life impossible" for budget airlines, Van Miert told the French-
speaking Belgian public radio channel RTBF.
 He noted creating wider access to cheap flights had been one of his commission's objectives in seeking to 
liberalise the European airline market.
    However, "it is probable that the decision is going to be attacked by one party or another, and it will most likely 
end up before the judges" of the European court, he said.

ROUNDUP P&O's ferries woe drags shares lower
ROUNDUP P&O's ferries woe drags shares lower
AFX European Focus
November 13, 2003 Thursday
Copyright 2003 AFX News Limited
Section: COMPANY NEWS
Length: 951 words
Dateline: LONDON
Body
Shares in Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Co were nearly 10 pct lower in early afternoon trading after the 
group revealed a disappointing performance from its ferries division in the peak third quarter season and warned 
the outlook for the business remains unfavourable.
    This, coupled with news that P&O's logistics division saw further competitive pressure in the US in the third 
quarter, prompted sector analysts to cut current year profit forecasts for the group by some 6 pct.
    The ferries and logistics woe was partly offset by a robust performance from P&O's core ports division and a 
return to operating profit at P&O Nedlloyd Container Line -- P&O's 50:50 container shipping joint venture with Royal 
Nedlloyd Group NV.
    The ferries division saw tourist vehicle carryings fall 7 pct in the three months to end-September compared to the 
same period last year, while passenger carryings were 9 pct down -- reflecting the weak market conditions in the 
travel industry that have existed since the outbreak of the Iraq war together with increased competition from the no-
frills airlines, notably easyJet and Ryanair.
    "There was a reluctance to go abroad which was exacerbated for once by the rather glorious summer we 
experienced over here," said Russ Peters, managing director of P&O Ferries.
    "There has been, there is no question, pressure on what we do caused by the increased range of options offered 
by the low cost airlines."
    On the Short Sea (Dover-Calais) route, P&O's tourist vehicle carryings were 3 pct down, rates were 6 pct down 
and passenger carryings were 10 pct lower -- the latter factor reflecting a 14 pct decline in the overall coach market 
as operators moved to focus on UK holidays for the 2003 season.
 On P&O's other ferry routes (North Sea, Irish Sea and the Western Channel) there was a 12 pct decline in tourist 
vehicles carryings and an 8 pct decline in passenger carryings. Rates were similar or ahead of last year.
    The freight business continued to experience steady volume growth -- 4 pct ahead of 2002, but rates were 
slightly down.
    Although P&O is examining ways to improve the ferry performance, such as taking on the airlines with better 
marketing, Peters warned investors not to expect a swift turnaround.
    "We do think it is a trend that is probably going to affect us for the next couple of years," he said.
ROUNDUP P&O's ferries woe drags shares lower
    For the full year he forecast total vehicle carryings down 7-8 pct and passenger carryings down 10 pct.
    During the third quarter P&O's cold logistics business continued to experience competitive pressures, with 
California particularly hit by low fish and strawberry volumes.
    CSFB reacted by downgrading its investment rating for P&O to 'neutral' from 'outperform' and its 2003 EBIT 
(earnings before interest and tax) forecast by 7.4 pct to 206.5 mln stg -- reflecting a reduction in its ferries EBIT 
forecast from 18.6 mln stg to 2.5 mln, partly offset by a modest upgrade in cargo shipping (plus 2.6 mln stg).
    After adjusting for a slightly lower interest charge the broker's pretax profit forecast falls from 117.2 mln stg to 
104.6 mln, giving EPS of 9.2 pence, down from 10.4 previously.
    The ferries disappointment overshadowed another robust performance from P&O's core ports business. This saw 
container volumes increase 24 pct in the third quarter with 13 pct attributable to organic or like-for-like growth.
    Year to date growth is 26 pct, with 20 pct attributable to organic growth.
    Asia, where half of P&O's ports business is located, saw third quarter organic growth of 20 pct, powered by its 
ports in China and India.
    In China, the next phase of Qingdao, roughly the size of Southampton, is about to be handed over, while in India, 
P&O's new terminal at Mundra near Delhi, is now fully operational.
    But analysts cautioned that stronger volume growth may not translate into higher profits due to pressure from a 
weaker dollar.
    Meanwhile, P&O Nedlloyd reported its best quarterly operating performance for nearly three years.
    Operating profits (before restructuring costs) were 56 mln usd, compared to analysts' forecasts of 30-60 mln usd 
and versus a loss of 46 mln last time, reflecting an 18 pct improvement in average revenue per teu (twenty foot 
equivalent unit).
    The joint venture flagged that the positive trend is being maintained in the fourth quarter.
    "Despite new building orders, the supply/demand balance in the industry is expected to remain favourable until at 
least the end of 2005, with an increasingly positive outlook for 2004," it said.
    P&O's long-standing strategic objective is to reduce its investment in P&O Nedlloyd but there was no news on 
this today.
    The group's "preferred option" is to bring a third party to the joint venture, a move that would provide the 
opportunity for significant cost savings. Less favoured options include a demerger or an independent listing for P&O 
Nedlloyd.
    "The key fact is that for P&O Nedlloyd the tide is turning and we've seen steady improvements in the third quarter 
but we're not quite there yet and resolving the present structural issues is a top priority both for ourselves and for 
Royal Nedlloyd," said Peter Smith, director, communications and strategy.
    "One can't anticipate at this stage precisely what the outcome will be nor the timescale."
    At 1.01 pm deferred shares in P&O were down 27 pence at 258-1/2, valuing the group at 1.9 bln stg.

     Share prices closed higher, but they were kept in check this afternoon by the key US data, which revealed an 
unexpected growth in the trade deficit, possibly indicating that the US economy may be weaker than earlier 
believed, brokers said.
    The KFX index closed 2.11 points higher at 253.33 and the KBX benchmark index was 1.58 points higher at 
217.76.
    The KAX All Share index closed 1.53 points higher at 221.41 on turnover of 2.37 bln dkr.
    AP Moeller-Maersk A closed 300 higher at 45,200 and the B-shares rose 300 to 47,100 after peer P&O Nedlloyd 
Container Line posted a third-quarter operating profit of 56 mln usd - up from a loss of 46 mln usd the year earlier - 
and said the positive trend is being maintained in the fourth quarter.
    DSV added 0.5 to 240.5, extending yesterday's rise after it retained its full-year guidance after posting a nine-
months EBITA of 607 mln dkr, slightly down from the 619 mln dkr posted a year earlier, but in line with the SME 
consensus of 607 mln dkr, brokers said.
    DFDS shed 1 to 181.
    SAS AB fell 0.5 to 59.5. Scandinavian Airlines System plans to launch a new independent low-priced airline 
group in Scandinavia, daily Boersen reported without citing sources.
    SAS chief executive officer Joergen Lindegaard said to Boersen that SAS in Scandinavia will in future operate a 
"one-class, more low-price oriented product."
    The plan is to put all Norwegian and Swedish domestic flights together with the significant traffic between the 
three Scandinavian capitals into a low-price airline group, which will have the freedom to set costs on the same 
terms as competitors such as EasyJet and Ryanair, the daily said.
 GN Store Nord was up 0.9 at 39.6, extending yesterday's rise following news that Siemens has appointed GN 
Store Nord as a supplier of Siemens' second-generation Bluetooth headsets.
    NKT Holding added 1 to 117, while TDC closed 0.5 lower at 212.
Danish shares close higher, but tempered by US key data UPDATE
    B&O Holding B shed 3 to 245. The group is considering moving some of its component production to Eastern 
Europe in an attempt to reduce costs, chief executive officer, Torben Ballegaard Soerensen, said to Danish Radio 
local station DR Midt & Vest. Some 1,300 jobs may be affected, the radio station said.
    Radiometer B added 9.5 to 408.5 and Vestas Wind Systems rose 1.5 to 122.5.
    NEG Micon was 1.5 higher at 63. It has reached a settlement in a legal dispute regarding the Le Nordais project 
in Canada.
    Lundbeck was up 4.5 at 1025, recovering from recent falls. Brokers said investors ignored a downgrade to 
'reduce' from 'accumulate' by Jyske Bank, which also cut the 12-months price target cut to 105 dkr from 140 dkr, 
after last week's very disappointing interim report.
    Novo Nordisk B added 4 to 237.5 and NeuroSearch rose 3 to 167, while Novozymes B shed 3.5 to 215.5.
    Coloplast B closed 9 higher at 539. Analysts polled for RB-Boeresen expect it to post full-year net profit of 563 
mln dkr, compared with 605 mln a year ago, on Tuesday.
    FLS Industries B was down 0.5 at 75. Its FL Smidth unit has received an order worth about 20 mln eur for 
production equipment from Syria. The new order will make a positive contribution to the group's earnings in 2004 
and 2005, but does not affect the forecast for this year, which was a disappointment to investors, brokers said.
    Danisco added 3 to 259 on news its venture fund Danisco Venture has invested in US-based Linguagen, which 
develops ingredients used to improve the taste of food, beverages and pharmaceutical products.
    Carlsberg B shed 3.5 to 261.5 and Chr Hansen Holding B fell 7 to 343, while East Asiatic Co added 2 to 235.

The European Commission said the threat by Ryanair Holdings PLC to close Charleroi airport if subsidies the low-
cost carrier has received are declared illegal state aid will have no effect on the decision on the case.
    Earlier, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the company will appeal immediately if the commission 
rules that the subsidies are unlawful state aid and will explore if Chareloi airport -- the company's continental 
European hub -- could be privatised.
 If privatisation is not possible, O'Leary said the company would be forced temporarily to close its base at Charleroi 
while its appeal is pending and transfer its aircraft and routes to another privately-owned European city airport.
    Commission spokesman for air transport Gilles Gantelet said: "We have to take a legal decision. This cannot be 
affected by outside declarations."
    In response to claims by Ryanair that it has seen a draft of the commission's decision on the state aid probe, 
Gantelet said: "The decision has not been taken. These are only rumours and are not based on reality. We are still 
discussing the case in the commission."
    The commission has been investigating for 11 months what it claims could be illegal state subsidies, such as 
reduced landing charges and financial help in marketing, staff training and recruitment.
    EU transport commissioner Loyola de Palacio is expected to rule by the end of this month or in early December.

(Updating to add more detail, background)
 Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has learned that a draft report from the European Commission indicates that 
substantial parts of its 25-year commercial deal at Brussels Charleroi airport will be found to be unlawful state aid.
    The Dublin-based no-frills airline said that should this be confirmed by the Commission it would immediately 
appeal to the European Court in Luxembourg to have the decision overturned given that the package offered by 
Charleroi to Ryanair was offered to several other airlines.
 In the event of an unlawful state aid ruling Ryanair would also immediately enter into negotiations with both 
Brussels Charleroi and the regional government of Wallonia to explore the possibility of the airport being privatised 
and a similar long term, low cost, arrangement being put in place.
    Ryanair warned that if this is not possible it would be forced, temporarily, to close its base at Charleroi, while the 
appeal is pending, transfer its aircraft and the routes to another privately-owned European capital city airport, and 
then return if the negative decision can be overturned on appeal.
    "A negative decision by the Commission in this case will be manifestly in error and will do untold damage to the 
growth of low fare air travel and competition in European air transport," Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary 
warned.
    The Commission has been investigating for 11 months what it claims could be illegal state subsidies, such as 
reduced landing charges and financial help in marketing, staff training and recruitment.
    EU transport commissioner Loyola de Palacio is expected to rule by the end of this month.
    At 11.31 am Ryanair shares were down 35 cents at 6.47 eur.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said moves by the EU Commission to rule against it in the Charleroi case will be damaging 
for competition and low fare air travel.
    Referring to a Financial Times report that the European Commission is expected to take a tough line in a state-
aid case against Ryanair, by ruling that several of the benefits granted to the Irish low-cost airline are illegal, the low 
cost carrier said any ruling against it may result in it withdrawing altogether from Brussels Charleroi Airport, close 
down 10 routes and remove low fare air services that are presently used by 2 mln passengers a year.
 Ryannair may also have to appeal to the European Court, it added.
    According to the FT, the final decision in the case is expected this month but people familiar with the preliminary 
ruling say the carrier will also be ordered to repay some of the benefits it received in return for setting up a base in 
Charleroi.
    Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary said: "It is wrong that the EU Commission in Brussels can impose 
artificial constraints on the growth of low fare air travel and/or competition in Europe simply to appease high fare 
airlines and high cost airports such as Zaventem.
    "If these findings as leaked in the Financial Times are correct - it would appear that bureaucrats in Brussels wish 
to prevent privately owned airlines
developing low cost arrangements at publicly owned airports for the benefit of consumers, lower fares, growth and 
jobs.

Leading shares are expected to open higher this morning, lifted by a late recovery by Wall Street last night, 
although concerns over yesterday's interest rate rise and caution ahead of this afternoon's key US jobs data looks 
like limiting gains, dealers said.
       According to spread betting firm, IG Index, the FTSE 100 index is expected to open around 25 points higher at 
4,350, after closing yesterday at 4324.2.
       On Wall Street last night, the DJIA closed 36.14 points higher at 9856.97, while the Nasdaq ended the day 17 
points higher at 1976.37, as upbeat economic news and Wednesday's better than expected earnings from Cisco 
lifted sentiment, traders noted.
       Looking ahead to this afternoon however, investors will be eagerly awaiting what is expected to be an upbeat 
October non-farm payroll report.
       Economists believe US businesses added around 40,000 jobs in October, a bit less than the 57,000 added in 
September. It would be the first back-to-back gains in payrolls in nearly a year, another hopeful sign better times 
are just ahead, dealers said.
       Also due later today, US October wholesale inventories and September consumer credit data should provide 
further clues as to the health of the world's largest economy.
       In Asia overnight, the Nikkei 225 index closed 76.68 points higher at 10,628.98, while the Hang Seng ended its 
morning session 40.10 points higher at 12,190.19.
        In company news, Cookson is due to issue a third quarter trading update later this morning, with the market 
looking for signs of improvement in the group's key markets.
     Cookson announced yesterday that it had completed the sale of its loss-making electronics equipment business, 
Speedline, to KPS Special Situations Fund II for 6 mln stg.
    Away from earnings news, EMI looks like remaining in focus after
Sony Music announced yesterday that it is planning to link up with Bertelsmann.
    The deal could put pressure on the remaining competitors EMI, Universal and Warner Music to merge, according 
to dealers.
London shares outlook - higher after Wall St recovery, payroll data seen key
    However, EMI declined to comment yesterday on reports it has secured up to 1 bln usd in bank loans to fund a 
bid for Warner Music.
    Ryanair could suffer after the Financial Times reported that the European Commisssion is expected to take a 
tough line in a landmark state-aid case against the company, by ruling that several of the benefits granted to the 
Irish airline are illegal.
    BAT should also be in focus after the group ruled out the possibility of improving its offer for the tobacco business 
of Turkish state group Tekel after being trumped by lone rival Japan Tobacco.
    Japan Tobacco gave the highest bid of 1.15 bln usd for Tekel's cigarette arm, Sigara Sanayi Isletmeleri.

(Updating to add more detail from Ryanair's interim statement)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based no frills airline, reported better-than-expected profits for its first half, 
predicted strong traffic growth for the balance of the year but said it remained cautious on fares and yields.
    For the six months to Sept 30 Ryanair saw adjusted profit after tax rise 16 pct to 175.5 mln eur, a record, on 
revenue up 28 pct to 596.4 mln eur.
    Adjusted profit after tax excludes exceptional costs of 5.4 mln eur and a goodwill charge of 1.2 mln eur. Adjusted 
EPS was 23.21 cents, up 16 pct.
    The performance reflected a 45 pct increase in passenger numbers to 11.3 mln.
    However, average fares declined by 12 pct for the half year as the airline cut prices to fill the extra capacity it has 
added. The group increased seat capacity by 50 pct over the summer. Operating costs rose 32 pct.
    After tax margins declined, as predicted by the company, from 32 pct to 29 pct.
    "These results demonstrate another strong performance from Ryanair's low fares model which continues to grow 
profitably in adverse market conditions across Europe," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
    "During a period impacted by a war in Iraq, high oil prices, and a depressed economic environment in Europe, 
Ryanair has taken delivery of 18 new Boeing aircraft, acquired, restructured and relaunched Buzz, opened two new 
bases in Milan Bergamo and Stockholm Skavsta, and launched over 50 new routes."
 O'Leary said that with most of the new routes performing well, the airline is running slightly ahead of its expectation 
of a 5 pct load factor decline for the year.
    "Looking forward for the remainder of the fiscal year, we remain confident that traffic growth will continue to be 
strong, but cautious about fares and yields," he said.
    "We expect that average yields will continue to decline by between 10 and 15 pct compared to those charged last 
year, and remain equally determined that Ryanair will continue to be the lowest fare airline in every market in which 
we operate.
    "Accordingly we expect profits to grow materially, as we continue to maintain our margins in excess of 20 pct."
Ryanair H1 profits top expectations - UPDATE
    The European Commission launched a formal investigation into Ryanair's financial relationship with both 
Charleroi and the regional government of Wallonia last December. It is investigating what it claims could be illegal 
state subsidies.
    "We continue to await a final decision of the European Commission on the Charleroi investigation, but remain 
confident that Commissioner de Palacio will put in place a framework that will encourage and enable publicly owned 
airports such as Charleroi and Strasbourg to compete on a level playing field with the many privately owned airports 
around Europe," added O'Leary.
    To "celebrate" its interim results Ryanair is offering 1 mln seats at 1 stg each (plus taxes and charges).
    Ryanair shares closed Friday at 7.24 eur.

ROUNDUP Ryanair predicts reprimand from EU over Charleroi

Ryanair Holdings PLC expects the outcome of the European Commission's investigation into its financial 
relationship with Charleroi airport in Belgium to be no more than a slap on the wrist.
    News of its expectations from the 11-month inquiry came as the Dublin-based no-frills airline reported a better-
than-expected rise in first half profits, predicted strong traffic growth for the balance of the year but remained 
cautious on the outlook for average fares or yields.
    Michael Cawley, joint deputy chief executive, told AFX News in an interview that Ryanair anticipates a reprimand 
over its 25-year deal with Charleroi airport and the regional government of Wallonia but no financial penalties.
    The Commission is investigating what it claims could be illegal state subsidies, such as reduced landing charges 
and financial help in marketing, staff training and recruitment. EU transport commissioner Loyola de Palacio is 
expected to rule by the end of November.
    "We're as confident as ever," said Cawley. "We think we're probably going to get a bit of a reprimand about 
maybe the length of the deal".
    He said it is possible the Commission may force Ryanair to reduce the length of the contract but expressed 
confidence the airline would not have to pay back any subsidies.
    He reiterated Ryanair's view that the deal fulfills all the criteria to rebut the charges of state aid.
    "It's not an exclusive arrangement, it was open to the other airlines if they were prepared to fly to Charleroi and 
the deal offered by Charleroi is not as good as many private airport deals we have."
 He maintained the airline has proved both these points to the Commission.
    "We also believe that no European Commission is going to roll back the benefits of low fare air travel and nor are 
they going to prevent publicly owned airports from competing," he said.
    "A template will come out of this for our future deals and we've already discussed this with many of our partners. 
We don't think there will be any difficulty with that."
    His comments came as Ryanair reported a 16 pct rise in adjusted profit after tax to a record 175.5 mln eur - 
ahead of sector analysts' consensus expectations of around 168 mln, and a pretax profit of 187.5 mln eur up from 
168.7 mln on revenue up 28 pct to 596.4 mln.
ROUNDUP Ryanair predicts reprimand from EU over Charleroi
    Adjusted profit after tax excludes exceptional costs of 5.4 mln eur (relating to the acquisition of rival Buzz from 
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV as well as aircraft depreciation charges) and a goodwill charge of 1.2 mln eur. 
Adjusted EPS was 23.21 cents, up 16 pct.
    The performance reflected a 45 pct increase in passenger numbers to 11.3 mln at lower average fares and 
continued tight cost control.
    Operating costs rose 32 pct and after tax margins declined, as predicted by the company, from 32 pct to 29 pct.
    Although average fares declined by 12 pct in the half year as the airline cut prices to fill the 50 pct extra capacity 
it added over the summer, the fall was less than analysts had expected. Also 40 pct of the yield decline was due to 
the weakness of sterling versus the euro.
    "These results demonstrate another strong performance from Ryanair's low fares model which continues to grow 
profitably in adverse market conditions across Europe," said chief executive Michael O'Leary
    "During a period impacted by a war in Iraq, high oil prices, and a depressed economic environment in Europe, 
Ryanair has taken delivery of 18 new Boeing aircraft, acquired, restructured and relaunched Buzz, opened two new 
bases in Milan Bergamo and Stockholm Skavsta, and launched over 50 new routes."
    With the vast majority of the new routes performing well, the airline is running slightly ahead of its expectation of 
a 5 pct load factor (the number of seats sold as a proportion of available seats) decline for the year. Of its two new 
bases Milan is performing better than Stockholm.
    Three Scandinavian routes to Aarhus, Oslo and Tampere are under plan as are some Stansted-France routes. 
Ryanair signalled it will axe them if performance does not improve during the winter season.
    The airline flagged that costs at Dublin airport will rise substantially next year and once again called on the Irish 
government to increase competition.
    It also said it is in talks with financial institutions for lower cost financing for some of its new Boeing 737-800 
series deliveries.
    "Looking forward for the remainder of the fiscal year, we remain confident that traffic growth will continue to be 
strong, but cautious about fares and yields," said O'Leary.
    "We expect that average yields will continue to decline by between 10 and 15 pct compared to those charged last 
year, and remain equally determined that Ryanair will continue to be the lowest fare airline in every market in which 
we operate.
    Ryanair expects to maintain margins in excess of 20 pct and year to end-March 2004 profits "to grow materially". 
Deutsche Bank is forecasting a pretax profit of 291.9 mln eur and a net profit of 263.3 mln, up from 264.5 mln and 
239.4 mln respectively.
    Having carried 16 mln passengers last year the airline is targeting 24 mln this year.
    To "celebrate" its interim results Ryanair is offering 1 mln seats at 1 stg each (plus taxes and charges). This is on 
top of 3 mln 'free' seats already offered for the winter season.
    At 3.14 pm shares in Ryanair were down 17 cents at 7.07 eur.

Virgin Express Holdings PLC said it has rejected the offer to operate from Charleroi airport with the same 
contractual terms and conditions offered to Ryanair Holdings PLC, saying it does not wish to receive what it 
believes to be illegal subsidies.
    Virgin Express wrote to EU transport commissioner Loyola de Palacio to express its concerns about the 
subsidies offered by Charleroi airport, south of Brussels, to Ryanair.
 Following publication of this letter, Charleroi issued a press release offering Virgin the opportunity to operate from 
there with the same terms and conditions which apply to Ryanair.
    Virgin said: "Virgin Express, along with almost every other airline in Europe, believes that the subsidies being 
given to Ryanair are contrary to EC rules. If this is correct, they are, quite clearly, illegal."
    The company added that it has "no wish now and never has had any wish to receive illegal subsidies and 
furthermore does not wish any other airline to receive them".
    It said it wants to see an end to unfair competition and illegal payments to competitors and that it "certainly does 
not wish to be party to increasing the unfairness".

Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC were flat in morning trading after better-than-expected first-half profits from the 
Dublin-based no-frills airline were offset by cautious comments on fares and yields for the balance of the year.
    At 10.15 am, the shares were up 0.1 cent at 7.25 eur.
    For the six months to Sept 30, Ryanair saw adjusted profit after tax rise 16 pct to 175.5 mln eur, a record, on 
revenue up 28 pct to 596.4 mln eur.
    Adjusted profit after tax excludes exceptional costs of 5.4 mln eur and a goodwill charge of 1.2 mln eur. Adjusted 
EPS was 23.21 cents, up 16 pct.
    The performance reflected a 45 pct increase in passenger numbers to 11.3 mln.
    Operating costs rose 32 pct and after tax margins declined, as predicted by the company, from 32 pct to 29 pct.
    Although average fares declined by 12 pct for the half year as the airline cut prices to fill the 50 pct extra capacity 
it added over the summer, the fall was less than analysts had anticipated.
    For the balance of the year, Ryanair expects average fares to continue to decline by between 10 and 15 pct 
compared to those charged last year.
    It expects profits to grow "materially" and margins to be maintained in excess of 20 pct.
    Merrill Lynch reiterated its 'neutral' recommendation and reckons the shares are up with its 7 eur fair value 
assessment.
    "This assumes a P/E (price/earnings ratio) of 20 times the current year (EPS) estimate (of 0.35 cents), a year in 
which the medium term growth rate may be disrupted by Buzz integration and above average capacity growth," it 
told clients.
 The broker believes there is a risk that the current year slow down in earnings growth versus previous years could 
develop as a more durable feature and hold back the shares' rating in the medium term.
    However, looking to the long term Merrills sees Ryanair's business model as robust, with the company likely to 
remain a winner in European short haul as the lowest cost producer of a commodity product.
    Citigroup Smith Barney reiterated its 'hold' stance, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein its 'reduce' stance and 5.0 
eur target price and Deutsche Bank its 'sell' recommendation and 5.9 eur target.

Leading shares are expected to drift lower in early trade this morning, starting the first session of November in the 
same fashion they left October following a mixed showing from Wall Street on Friday, with all eyes directed to this 
week's decision on UK interest rates, dealers said.
    Spread betting firm City Index expects the FTSE 100 index to open just 5 points easier.
    The UK blue chip index ended 13.3 points lower on Friday at 4,287.6.
    Pre-weekend on Wall Street, the DJIA closed 14.51 points higher at 9,801.12 helped by some encouraging US 
data at the end of a hectic month, but the Nasdaq composite index missed out, ending 0.48 points easier at 
1,932.21.
    In Asia today, the Tokyo market is closed for a public holiday, while the Hang Seng index ended its morning 
session 169.09 points higher at 12,359.19 bolstered by hopes for the US economy.
    The main focus this week will undoubtedly be the November meeting of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy 
Committee, with the vast majority of forecasters predicting a quarter point hike in UK interest rates on Thursday.
    After the revelation two weeks ago that October's decision by the MPC to keep monetary policy on hold was 
much closer than expected, most economists have been predicting that UK rates will be raised this month, with 
recent bullish economic data also adding weight to the case.
    But there will be few key pointers to provide the MPC with any further information this week.
 Today's only interest will be the October UK CIPS manufacturing sector PMI report, and the latest CBI monthly 
distributive trades survey.
    Meanwhile, in the US this week, all roads will lead to the key October jobs report, to be published on Friday, 
although today's October ISM manufacturing report will provide some distraction, as will September construction 
spending figures.
    The UK corporate diary contains some fairly important earnings news later this week -- including interims from 
blue chips such as Marks & Spencer, Boots, BAA, and BG Group -- but today's batch of results are unlikely to set 
the market aflame.
London shares outlook - weaker on mixed Wall Street Friday, UK rate hike fears
    Irish airline Ryanair reported first-half results early on this morning, with adjusted net profit after tax increasing to 
175.5 mln eur, up from 150.9 mln previously, on revenues of 596.4 mln eur against 464.6 mln.
    The discount carrier said it expects average yields to decline by 10-11 pct over the rest of the year but still 
expects full year profits to 'grow materially'.
    Meanwhile, on-line travel firm ebookers will release third-quarter numbers later today, providing another 
barometer of the health of the industry.
    Aside from the results, however, investors will also be looking for any hints about any possible bids for the group, 
with US media entrepreneur Barry Diller having recently stated an interest in acquiring an on-line travel firm.
    Elsewhere, fellow second liner Thus will report its first-half numbers today, and broker Investec is looking for 
strong growth, with EBITDA seen up 78 pct to 19.4 mln stg
    However, as Thus released a pre-close statement at the end of September stating it was on track to meet 
expectations for the full year, the broker is expecting few surprises from the alternate carrier's results.
    And first-quarter results from internet security firm Surcontrol should also contain few surprises, with the small 
cap group having pre-announced the figures in October.
    Arbuthnot anticipates Surfcontrol reporting revenue for the three months to September 2003 of 19.4 mln usd, up 
24 pct year-on-year from 15.4 mln, but down sequentially from 20.4 in Q4.
    However the broker sees EBITDA at 3.8 mln, up from 1.8 mln a year ago and up from 3.2 mln in Q4.
    Away from results, second line consumer products firm PZ Cussons will host its AGM today, with investors 
looking for news on current trading.
    Among reports in the weekend press, second line real estate firm Canary Wharf will remain in focus amid 
continuing talk that a bid for the Docklands developer is imminent, with reports suggesting that a Morgan Stanley-
led consortium could table a 1.5 bln stg offer as early as today.
    A report in the Sunday Telegraph also suggested that Canadian firm Brascan, and Canary Wharf's chairman 
Paul Reichmann were also discussing a joint offer for the group, which saw its bid auction close last week.
    In other possible M&A deals, blue chip Sainsbury could be active after The Mail on Sunday newspaper 
suggested that US break-up specialists KKR have been running an eye over the under pressure food retail group.
    The newspaper reported that the US firm had engaged former Asda boss Archie Norman to consider bidding for 
the firm, although KKR denied such talk.
    Earlier this year KKR had indicated an interest in joining the five-way bid battle for Safeway, but withdrew its 
interest after news of an OFT probe in to the situation.
    Meanwhile Safeway could also be active after weekend press reports suggested that William Morrison -- now the 
blue chip firm's only potential bidder after retail entrepreneur Philip Green ruled out an offer last Friday -- has now 
got OFT approval to proceed with its bid.
    In the banking sector, RBoS could be active after The Business newspaper suggested the firm recently made a 
4.5 bln stg bid approach to Sovereign Bancorp of Philadelphia, which was rebuffed by the US firm.
    Confectionery blue chip Cadbury Schweppes may also attract attention after the Sunday Telegraph reported that 
the group is considering spinning-off its US soft drinks business, Dr Pepper-Seven Up
    And blue chip satellite broadcaster should be active after confirmation that a key board meeting this afternoon will 
make a decision as to who will become the firm's new chief executive.
    James Murdoch, son of BSkyB's founder and chairman Rupert Murdoch remains favourite to secure the position 
in spite of some institutional disquiet about his appointment.

Body
Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, has subsidies paid by Belgium's 
Charleroi airport that are being probed in an EU anti-trust investigation.
    O'Leary told France's Le Monde newspaper that the subsidies paid by the airport south of Brussels for the carrier 
to use the airport were legal.
 "The subsidies paid by the airport of Charleroi are not state subsidies," he said, according to the text in French.
    "These advantages are therefore not incompatible with the smooth functioning of the domestic market," he 
added.
    The EU's executive arm is planning to conclude an anti-trust investigation into the Ryanair-Charleroi link-up by 
the end of the year.
    Ryanair has warned that the future of low-cost air travel in Europe is at stake. The decision by the European 
Commission will also set out the principles to be applied by all European airports where Ryanair is present and 
receives subsidies.
    O'Leary stressed that negotiations had been held with Charleroi airport and not with the regional Belgian 
authorities.
    The same conditions were offered to seven other companies who refused, he added.
    "Low-cost airlines are the only ones which contribute to the development of secondary airports and local 
tourism," he told the newspaper.

Body
Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it will not compromise on the issue of low costs or low fares, should 
the European Commission's ruling on the alleged subsidies the airline received for flying into Charleroi airport "alter 
Ryanair's cost base and low fares at Charleroi or any other low fare airport by so much as one centime."
    Ryanair said it "remains confident that the low-cost base negotiated at Brussels Charleroi Airport complies with 
the state aid rules in that it was/is similar to the low-cost base offered to Ryanair at other privately owned airports".
 The low-cost base, said Ryanair, "was non-exclusive on the basis that it was offered to a number of other airlines, 
all of whom refused to take up the enormous risk of developing new routes and traffic at Brussels Charleroi".
    Ryanair said it has no idea what the form or content of the final Commission decision will be.
    To the extent that the Commission's final decision focuses on issues of time periods, or transparency, or the 
availability of low-cost arrangements to other competing airlines, then Ryanair would support any rules or 
framework which will allow publicly owned airports to compete with privately owned airports all over Europe.
    "However, there will be no compromise on costs, or low fares and jobs at Charleroi," said Ryanair.

(updates with Virgin's estimate of value of subsidy; further quotes)
     Virgin Express Holdings PLC alleged Ryanair Holdings PLC is benefiting from subsidies worth 30 eur per 
passenger at its at continental European hub at Charleroi airport south of Brussels.
    In an open letter to EU transport commissioner Loyola de Palacio, Virgin Express managing director Neil Burrows 
urged the Commission to take a tough line in its ongoing antitrust probe into Ryanair.
 The commission is due to conclude its investigation into the Ryanair-Charleroi link-up by the end of the year.
    Virgin Express is based at Zavantem airport, the main facility serving Brussels.
    Burrows said airlines operating out of Zavantem had to pay much higher charges while Ryanair benefits from 
subsidises from the Wallonian regional government.
    Ryanair argues its use of Charleroi has revitalised the neglected airport and brought hundreds of jobs to the local 
economy.
    "Everyone knows that this is nonsense," Burrows said. "In the case of Charleroi, real job creation for local people 
has been very limited."
    The subsidies come to 30 euros per passenger, giving Ryanair a major edge over other budget airlines, he said.
    "Those responsible for providing subsidies to an airline that is clearly not in any need of them are acting contrary 
to the interests of fair competition," Burrows added.

The Gulf emirate of Sharjah, part of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), will launch its own airline next week, billing it 
as the first low-cost carrier in the Middle East, said Ali Fairuz, sales and marketing director for Air Arabia.
    "This is the first no frills, low-cost airline in the Middle East," he said.
 Air Arabia will inaugurate its first flight on October 28 to neighbouring Bahrain.
    "People used to flying once a year will now fly more often," he said, adding that the government-owned Air Arabia 
was modelled after private discount carriers such as Britain's Easy Jet and Ireland's Ryanair.
    In addition to its low cost mandate, Fairuz said the new airline will promote Sharjah as a tourist and business 
destination.
    Air Arabia will initially fly to Bahrain, Beirut, Damascus, Kuwait, Muscat and Tehran.
    The ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammed al-Qassimi, said in February the new company would 
operate with an initial capital of 10 mln dirhams (2.7 mln usd) and would "contribute to the development of the air 
transport sector" in the UAE.

Qantas Airways Ltd said its board has approved the launch of a new low cost domestic carrier in May 2004.
    The yet-to-be named carrier will operate as a separate business with its own management and brand, chief 
executive Geoff Dixon said in a statement.
 Dixon said it will be established using the operation of the former low cost carrier Impulse, which was acquired by 
Qantas in May 2001, or by using a new 'greenfield' company with a decision be made within six weeks on which 
option will be taken.
    "This will be a true low cost carrier - lean, highly competitive and with the standards of safety and reliability 
associated with Qantas," Dixon said.
    Negotiations are underway with Boeing, Airbus and aircraft lessors for the acquisition of 737-800 or A320 aircraft 
that will see the new carrier have a minimum of 23 planes by mid-2005.
    The current Qantas domestic operation will continue as is with an even greater focus on business market, he 
said.
    Alan Joyce has been appointed executive general manager of the new low cost carrier.
    Dixon said a small team, including a number of former senior executives from European low cost carrier Ryanair, 
will assist Joyce to establish the new
airline.

Ryanair Holdings PlC chief executive officer Michael O'Leary said his no-frills airline is targeting higher sales in 
Finland than those of the national carrier Finnair Oyj within five years, reported financial newspaper Taloussanomat.
    In five years, O'Leary said he sees only four big airlines in Europe, namely British Airways PLC, Air France, 
Lufthansa AG, and Ryanair, the report said.
 O'Leary said he expects SAS' and Finnair's independence to be eroded or ended altogether.
    "It does not matter if BA buys Finnair or whether it will be cross-ownerships. The key issue is that alliances lead 
to higher prices," O'Leary was quoted as saying.

Irish airline Ryanair said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it would have to pay 4.8 million euros 
to Belgium's Charleroi Airport if the European Commission rules that the subsidies and incentives it received to fly 
into the airport were illegal, Ireland's Business World said.
 It already has suspended services to Strasbourg after a French court ruled the subsidies were illegal.

The European Commission denied a report that it has reached a deal with Ryanair Holding over the Charleroi state 
aid probe.
    Yesterday, the Sunday Times reported that Ryanair has reached a working agreement concerning the support 
given to Ryanair at Charleroi airport.
 Commission spokesman for airlines Gilles Gantelet told AFX News: "The European Commission has to decide on 
legal grounds. We do not have to have an agreement."
    "The point is to define on legal grounds what is acceptable. This is not a business agreement. There is no 
negotiation," said Gantelet.
    He added that the commission will make its decision in October to mid-November.
    Gantelet denied that there is any agreement on how contracts between airports and airlines should be negotiated 
in the future.    
    The newspaper reported that airports will have to put time limits on deals with airlines and publish the terms of 
deals.
    "This is something we were considering," said Gantelet but he added there is no decision yet.

(Updating with information about Ryanair service cessation)
     Groupe Air France SA unit Brit Air will resume flights between Strasbourg and London Gatwick on Oct 20 after 
rival low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC stopped services as a result of a court decision.
    Brit Air, which suspended the flights on May 17, will provide three daily flights between Strasbourg and London's 
Gatwick airport, Brit Air chairman Marc Lamidey said.
 In May, Brit Air complained of unfair competition from Ryanair, which had obtained subsidies from the local 
chamber of commerce to keep down its fares.
    A Strasbourg court earlier ruled the subsidies illegal earlier this month, prompting Ryanair to switch its operation 
from Strasbourg to the nearby German airport of Baden Baden.

Budget airline Ryainair has reached a working agreement with the European Commission on a dispute that 
threatened its European flights from the UK, said the Sunday Times newspaper in an unsourced report.
    The deal centres on the support given to Ryanair at Charleroi airport, near Brussels.
 The compromise should be announced within the next three weeks, said the paper, adding that it is expected 
airports will have to put time limits on deals with airlines and publish the terms of deals.
    No one at Ryanair could be reached immediately to comment.
    In 2001 Ryainair agreed a 15-year contract with Charleroi to have reducing landing fees and an airport 
contribution to advertising campaigns for new routes.
    The local authorities claimed it was legitimate to use taxpayers' money to attract Ryanair as it revived a deprived 
area where industries had collapsed.
    Charleroi also gave Ryanair hotel subsidies that it passed on to passengers.
    The commission has yet to decide whether the airline should return the accommodation subsidies.

---- by Karin Jensen ----    
     Scandinavian budget airline Sterling European's talks with rivals on creating an international alliance of low-price 
carriers could bear fruit in the long term, though cost and logistics problems would be need to be overcome, sector 
experts said.
    And if centred on the nordic region, such a tie-up could pose a potential threat to Scandinavian Airlines System, 
they said.
    Speaking after Sterling European managing director Torben Anker Soerensen referred to the talks in daily 
Berlingske Tidende, Jyske Bank analyst Brian Boersting agreed there is at least the potential for a low-price 
alliance.
    "But it will mean a different way of working," said Boersting, noting that budget carriers currently offer only point-
to-point services, and that major players such as Ryanair and EasyJet would be unlikely to participate.
    "Today, it's very simple, flying from A to B. If they expand by flying to point C, then it will mean more 
administration and a more complicated operation. The entire administration side will have to be rearranged (for the 
low-price carriers)," said Boersting.
    "I think, perhaps, it will be (possible) in the longer term, perhaps in two to four years … But the low-price 
companies are not big enough (right now) to expand their routes in order for it to pay off."
    Sterling European's Soerensen told AFX News there is "nothing concrete yet" emerging from the talks.
    "We always have close, informal dialogues with a number of low-price groups. Therefore it is also natural to 
discuss how we can do things better for our customers," he said.
 Soerensen denied that an alliance and an expanded air route network will lead to higher costs and thereby higher 
ticket prices.
    "This is an expression of a classical way of thinking and it is not in accordance with the way low-price companies 
think," said Soerensen
    Soerensen declined to name the carriers he is a talks with or provide a timeframe as to when an alliance might 
be formed.
FOCUS Budget airlines alliance a possibility long term; might threaten SAS
    Boersting said he would not expect the bigger budget airline groups such as Ryanair and EasyJet to join a tie-up 
as their air route network is already large enough.
    Participants in the alliance would therefore be limited.
    In addition, the high load factors that low-price airlines are operating with today would be difficult to maintain if the 
route networks were expanded.
    A new low-price alliance could, however, be a threat to Scandinavian Airlines System, especially if the regional 
carrier fails to bring down its cost base over the next few years, said Boersting.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is comfortable with the range of analyst expectations for the year, saying its business 
continues to be robust, with stronger traffic numbers.
    But it cautioned that yields are lower than expected, adding it believes that the yield environment this Winter will 
continue to be depressed.
    In a statement prepared for its AGM, it said costs remain under strict control and it therefore remains comfortable 
- given no changes in present circumstances - with the consensus range of analyst expectations for the fiscal year.
    Ryanair also hit back at speculation that recent adverse rulings regarding subsidies could damage its business 
model.
    It said:" "There has been some ill founded speculation that this decision may adversely damage Ryanair's 
business model. This is not the case.
    "Publicly owned airports, particularly in the regions of Europe, will continue to compete aggressively to win the 
low fare, high volume business which Ryanair generates and no EU ruling could ever prohibit or constrain publicly 
owned airports from competing with the many privately owned airports which Ryanair operates to.
    Referring to an EU probe into subsidies at Charleroi it said: "Ryanair continues to work closely with the EU 
Commission, in order to expedite their investigation of our Charleroi agreement.
    "We remain confident that Commissioner de Palacio will in her decision formulate a framework  which will not just 
allow but encourage all publicly owned airports to  compete on a level playing field with privately owned airports all 
over Europe.
 Referring to Ireland it said the situation "remains pitiful".
    "Whilst we welcomed the Government's decision to break up the Aer Rianta monopoly, the slow pace of change, 
and the continuing failure to adopt and approve competing terminals at Dublin Airport is hindering competition, 
choice and lower access fares into Ireland," the statement read.

Ryanair Holdings PLC expects to incur an exceptional charge of approximately 5 mln eur in the fiscal year to March 
31 2004 as it plans to retire nine - rather than the initially planned seven - of its 21 Boeing 737-200 jets this winter.
    A recent scheduled aircraft overhaul showed some scratches to the outer skin of a 737-200 series aircraft, which 
indicated that an inappropriate procedure may have been undertaken during the jet's last full repainting which was 
undertaken by FLS Aerospace in the UK, the airline said.
 A subsequent inspection of 10 further jets of the same type which had undergone the repainting showed that a total 
of nine were affected.
    "Given the planned retirement of the 737-200's, and the cost of repairing any affected aircraft, the board of 
Ryanair have decided that it would not be economically viable to carry out these repairs, and any of these aircraft - 
so affected - will be retired," the group said in a statement, adding it is examining the remainder of its 21-strong 
737-200 fleet.
    Ryanair is currently taking delivery of 15 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft over the next six months, with a further 29 
aircraft due for delivery in the 12 months thereafter.
    This delivery program was designed to facilitate the growth of the company and the retirement of its 21 737-200 
series aircraft.

(Updates with further background on other pending cases)
     A French appeal court today rejected a plea by Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC and the operator of 
the Strasbourg airport for suspension of a court ruling against subsidy payments to the carrier.
    The previous court ruling had found that payments by the airport operator, the local chamber of commerce, to the 
airline in the form of advertising to promote the London-Strasbourg route amounted to an improper subsidy.
 Ryanair, and the chamber of commerce which had funded the advertising with help from local authorities, argued 
that the payments were part of a legitimate commercial contract.
    The contract was legitimate to offset Ryanair's costs to open the service and to exploit the potential of the airline 
to bring people to the Strasbourg region of eastern France, they argued.
    Strasbourg was being served by Brit Air, a subsidiary of Air France, but it suspended its service in May 
complaining that the Ryanair arrangement distorted competition.
    Ryanair, which has warned that such opposition to its business model threatens fast-growing low-cost air travel in 
Europe, is waiting for a key ruling by the European Commission over similar arrangements at Charleroi airport 
south of the Belgian capital Brussels.
    In Denmark, civil aviation authorities have threatened to revoke the operating licence of Tistrup airport near the 
Danish city of Aarhus for the same reason.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it will go ahead with its plans to suspend flights between London Stansted and 
Strasbourg from Sept 24 after a French court today rejected its plea for a stay on a court ruling against subsidy 
payments to the low-cost airline.
    Instead, Ryanair will proceed with its previously announced plans to fly to Baden Baden in Germany, 40 km from 
Strasbourg.
 The previous court ruling, by the Administrative Tribunal in Strasbourg, had found that payments by the airport 
operator, the local chamber of commerce, to the airline in the form of advertising to promote the London-Strasbourg 
route amounted to an improper subsidy.
    Ryanair has appealed against the tribunal's decision, but the full appeal could take over a year to be heard, 
according to Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs.
    "We are dismayed with the court's decision rejecting our application for a stay on the tribunal's decision, which 
would have enabled us to reinstate our highly successful London-Strasbourg route. Ryanair was forced to 
announce the temporary suspension of the route following Air France's attempt to use the state aid rules to force us 
off the route.
    "We will now have to suspend the route pending the outcome of the appeal, which could take over a year to be 
heard," Callaghan said.
    He said Ryanair will continue to work with its partners in the Strasbourg chamber of commerce to appeal the 
decision of the tribunal.

A tie-up between KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV and French operator Air France would send shock waves through 
the airline industry and put pressure on British Airways PLC to find a partner, The Sunday Telegraph reported citing 
aviation analysts.
    The move would also kick-start a round of consolidation among European flyers, which aviation analysts say is 
long overdue, the article added.
 Talks between KLM and Air France are at an advanced stage and could lead to a merger as early as this week.
    "We are in advanced stage talks with Air France and we are making good progress," a spokesman for KLM is 
reported as saying.
    Separately, French daily Le Monde quoted labour union sources as saying Air France and KLM have both 
scheduled works council meetings for this Wednesday to present plans on an alliance between the two carriers.
    KLM is worth around 500 mln eur, while Air France is valued at 3.3 bln eur and is controlled by the French 
government.
    The talks come against a background of financial pain throughout the airline industry, caused by the post 9/11 
hangover, the SARS crisis and the success of low-cost carriers, such as Ryanair PLC.
    Six months ago, a merger between KLM and Air France would have been seen as a blow to British Airways, 
which has long viewed KLM as its natural partner in Europe.
    However, at BA's AGM in July, Rod Eddington, the chief executive, said that he now regarded Iberia, the Spanish 
airline, as its closest partner in Europe.

- U.S.-listed shares of European companies joined Wednesday's steep tech downturn as chip stocks led the 
widespread retreat
The Bank of New York European ADR Index lost 0.83 points, or 0.89 percent, to finish at 93.31. The Nasdaq 
Composite fared much worse, off 50 points, or 2.6 percent, at 1,824.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 87 points to close at 9,420. .
Texas Instruments'  third-quarter update left investors unsatisfied as they took the stock down 7.5 percent to 
$23.42.
The disappointment spilled over, with European chip stocks getting hammered. Shares of ASML  were the most 
active in the group, plummeting $1.13, or 6.9 percent, to close at $15.26. STMicroelectronics  dropped $1.45, or 5.5 
percent, to $25 and Infineon  shed 94 cents, or 6.1 percent, to $14.41.
On a positive note, the Netherlands' KLM Royal Dutch Airlines  was one of the NYSE's largest percentage gainers, 
rising 75 cents, or 6.7 percent, to finish at $11.99. Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported the air carrier and Air 
France would announce an alliance in two weeks.
Consequently, the French government is expected to swap part of its stake in Air France into KLM shares. KLM 
called the report "speculation," but did acknowledge again it has been in talks with Air France. .
Irish airline carrier Ryanair  wasn't as fortunate, ending the day down 85 cents, or 1.9 percent, at $43.79.
Over in the biotech sector, bellwether GlaxoSmithKline  jumped $1.19 to $41.72. Xenova  was the biggest winner in 
the segment, surging 19 percent to close at $2.47.

The Danish civil aviation authority has threatened to revoke the operating license of Tistrup airport near the central 
city of Aarhus because it allegedly favors Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC over its competitors, the 
authority said.
    It ordered the third biggest airport in Denmark to end by Oct 1 a practice of taxing Ryanair 35 dkr per passenger, 
half the rate charged to other airlines.
 "We warned the Aarhus airport several times this summer, and we will revoke its operating license if it does not 
conform to international rules to treat all companies equally," said Tina Larsen, spokeswoman for the aviation 
authority.
    "This practice represents an obstacle to competition and constitutes unjustifiable favoritism."
    Ryanair is already facing European Commission scrutiny and a court ruling against its commercial practices at 
Charleroi airport south of Brussels and in the eastern French city of Strasbourg.

Ryanair Holdings PLC chief excecutive Michael O'Leary said the contract offered to his airline to operate out of 
Charleroi near Brussels "is not state aid".
    O'Leary was speaking to journalists after talks with the European Commission, which has launched a state aid 
probe into the terms and conditions offered to the low-cost airline by Charleroi.
    He said he has presented documents to the commission which prove that the terms and conditions do not 
amount to state aid and show that any private investor would have offered the same terms.
    "We have shown documents to the commission to confirm that Charleroi operates with the private investor 
principle," said O'Leary.
    Nonetheless, O'Leary said there are no signs that the commission will drop its investigation on the back of this 
evidence produced by Ryanair.
    "The European Commission is not going to back down from the probe but we welcome that probe," said O'Leary.
    He said he also does not have any indication yet as to whether or not the commission will accept his company's 
argument that the Charleroi contract is not state aid.
    However, he added: "We remain confident that the commission finding will not affect our cost base or traffic at 
Charleroi."
    Instead, he said, it will actually result in a clarification of how such contracts should be made and these can then 
be replicated by other low-cost airlines.
    Concerning the contract, O'Leary said he does not expect the commission to demand changes.
If this happened then O'Leary said his company will not accept the decision.
    "We are confident the commission will not require changes to the contract in Charleroi. However, if we were our 
first instinct would be to appeal the decision," said O'Leary.
    The decision had been expected in Oct but may now be earlier according to O'Leary.
    "We hope for an early decision. The earlier the better. Our last indication was for September," he said.
    Charleroi airport approached Ryanair six years ago, asking it to set up services. The company operates the 
Brussels-Stanstead route and will shortly start flights to Skavsta, Stockholm.

The European Commission will not make its decision on its probe into Ryanair Holdings PLC's contract with 
Charleroi airport until October or November, EU sources said.
    Earlier, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he expects the decision to come in September.
He was talking to reporters following meetings with commission officials.
    O'Leary told journalists his low-cost airline has not been a recipient of state aid from Charleroi and that other 
operators, including those flying from Brussels-National airport, now face more competition with Ryanair operating 
out of Belgium, and thus have cut prices.    
    Commission spokesman for airlines Gille Gantelet told AFX News: "Loyola de Palacio (EU transport 
commissioner) has nothing against low costs".
    However, he added: "The commission must ensure rules are not broken."
    He said the probe "is a leading case which will drive the need to define clear rules for airports which allow more 
transparency and no discrimination."

Ryanair Holdings PLC, the no-frills airline, may have to drop many international routes following defeat in a French 
legal battle, the Financial Times newspaper reported citing chief executive Michael O'Leary.
    It is to suspend flights between Stansted and Strasbourg from Sept 24 because of a dispute with Groupe Air 
France over payments Ryanair receives to fly to secondary European airports.
 "If we continue to have rulings against us, growth will be confined to privately owned airports so it would exclude 
development of low-cost routes in France. Pulling out would be one of the options," O'Leary said.
    He added the airline was ready to stop using Charleroi airport in Belgium if a European Commission finding -- 
due in the autumn -- goes against him.
    "Strasbourg is nothing more than a skirmish. It would not have happened if it was not against the background of 
alleged state aid at Charleroi. Charleroi is our Waterloo," he said.
    Aside from Strasbourg, the group flies to 18 regional French airports from London including Biarritz, Montpellier 
and Perpignan, and France represents 3 mln of the company's 24 mln passengers, contributing about 12 pct of 
turnover.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is suspending its Strasbourg-London route from Sept 24 as a result of a dispute with 
an appeals court in France.
    Earlier this month, the Dublin-based low cost airline lodged a request, along with Strasbourg Airport and the 
Strasbourg Chamber of Commerce, with the Nancy Court of Appeal for a stay on its decision in July requiring the 
regional Chamber of Commerce to terminate its commercial agreement with the airline on Sept 24.
 The French court ruled July 27 that aid granted by the Strasbourg Chamber of Commerce to Ryanair was illegal.
    Ryanair said it still had not received confirmation from the court on the stay.
    "In order to give passengers at least four weeks notice, Ryanair has been forced to confirm that with effect from 
Sept 24 next, the two daily Strasbourg-London flights will be suspended and will operate instead to Baden
Baden Airport in Germany," the airline said.
    "If and when we receive a stay on the judgement (or win the appeal), then Ryanair will make arrangements to 
recommence flights on the London-Strasbourg route," it said, adding that it expects to obtain a stay on the 
judgement and to overturn the original decision of the Strasbourg Court.

 Speaking in Pau today, Ryanair chief executive, Michael O'Leary said the airport competed for Ryanair's business 
with 20 other airports, including nearby Tarbes.
    He said Ryanair chose to partner Pau because of "its efficient facilities, low costs and progressive management."
    O'Leary dismissed an allegation from the Tarbes Chamber of Commerce that Pau had paid "considerable sums 
of public money" to secure Ryanair's business as "untrue".

Fraport AG expects its airport in Hahn to break even in 2006, chairman Wilhem Bender said.
    "We expect a break-even at Hahn, with 5 mln passengers per year.
We expect this figure in 2006," said Bender.
    Apart from Hahn, which is about 80 km northwest of Frankfurt, Fraport also runs the Frankfurt, Antalya, 
Hannover, Lima and Saarbruecken airports.
    In the first six months of this year, Hahn, which is an important hub for no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, had 
1.08 mln passengers travel through it.
    Bender added that Fraport will at the end of August start proceedings against the Philippine government if an 
agreement has not yet been reached by then on damages for his company over the failed Terminal 3 project in 
Manila.
    Bender said the deadline for an agreement runs out at midnight tonight. However, Fraport spokesman Wolf-
Dieter Schaller added Fraport, as a sign of good will, will give the Philippines another two weeks.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based low cost airline, Strasbourg Airport and the Strasbourg Chamber of 
Commerce today lodged a request with the Nancy Court of Appeal for a stay on its decision last month requiring the 
regional Chamber of Commerce to terminate its commercial agreement with the airline on Sept 24.
    Ryanair warned that if the stay was not granted by August 24 the partners have agreed that the airline's twice 
daily route between Strasbourg and London Stansted would be terminated on Sept 24.
 It said alternative arrangements would be made for passengers with bookings after that date.
    "Ryanair and our two partners remain committed to the London-Strasbourg route," said Paul Fitzsimmons, the 
airline's head of communications.
    "We will take every step to pursue our appeal with the utmost urgency and we are confident that if and when we 
win the appeal, Ryanair will restore its twice daily low fare services on the London-Strasbourg route."
    The French court ruled July 27 that aid granted by the Strasbourg Chamber of Commerce to Ryanair was illegal.
    Last week Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said the French court's ruling had undermined his 
confidence that the European Commission would exonerate the airline in its dealings with Charleroi airport in 
Belgium.
    The Commission launched a formal investigation into Ryanair's relationship with Charleroi airport and the 
regional government of Wallonia in December 2002.
    It is investigating what it maintains could be illegal state subsidies and is expected to report its findings in the 
autumn.
    At 3.59 pm Ryanair shares were unchanged at 432.

(Updating to add more detail from easyJet statement, background)
     easyJet PLC, the Luton-based no-frills airline, said it carried 74.9 pct more passengers in July compared to last 
year.
    Its monthly traffic report revealed it carried 1.89 mln passengers in July versus 1.08 mln last year, bringing the 
total number of passengers to 19.8 mln for the last 12 months.
    The airline's load factor -- the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available -- fell 2.3 
pct to 85.6 pct from 87.9 pct last July, and was down 20 basis points from June. The rolling 12 month load factor 
was 83.8 pct.
    The July figures include those for Go Fly, acquired by easyJet last Summer.
    "easyJet's performance during July continues the trend predicted in our Summer trading statement," said chief 
executive Ray Webster.
    "Particularly pleasing is the achievement of load factors in the mid eighties, which confirms the appeal to 
passengers of our combination of
attractive fares and convenient airports."
    easyJet's July 22 update revealed forward bookings to the end of September were showing "strong growth".
    The airline said it was filling a similar share of its available seats as last year although with "marginally lower 
average yields".
    But it stressed the full year outcome is highly dependent on the final quarter from July to September.
    easyJet's third quarter yields, or average fares, fell 2.8 pct -- an improvement on the 10.7 pct decline of the first 
half. The slower rate of capacity increase contributed to reduced pressure on yields.
 Prior to today's statement sector analysts were forecasting a year to end-Sept pretax profit of around 50 mln stg, 
down from 71.6 mln last time.
    Earlier this week easyJet's fierce rival Ryanair Holdings PLC revealed a July load factor of 85 pct, up 6 points on 
June. The Dublin-based airline reiterated it expects its yields to fall 10-15 pct in the year to end-Sept.
    At 7.51 am easyJet shares were unchanged at 232 pence, valuing the airline at 908.7 mln stg.

(Correcting currency in third para to euro from sterling)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based low cost airline, reported first-quarter profits in line with market 
expectations and reiterated guidance that it expects yields, or average fares, this year to be 10 to 15 pct lower than 
last year.
    The airline also repeated its prediction that year to end-March 2004 profits will grow "materially" and that it will 
maintain net margins in excess of 20 pct.
    For the first quarter to June 30 2003 Ryanair saw adjusted profit after tax (adjusted net profit) -- excluding 2.7 mln 
eur of exceptional costs arising from the re-organisation of Buzz and a 0.6 mln eur goodwill charge from the Buzz 
acquisition -- of 43.8 mln eur, a performance in-line with sector analysts' expectations and a 12 pct increase on last 
year's 39.0 mln eur.
    First-quarter revenue increased 26 pct to 245.2 mln eur.
    Passenger traffic grew by 45 pct to 5.1 mln, although both average load factors -- the number of passengers as a 
proportion of the number of seats available -- and yields declined by 5 points to 78 pct and by 14 pct to 41.71 eur 
respectively.
    "These predicted reductions were due to the launch of 50 new routes and two new bases (Milan-Bergamo and 
Stockholm-Skavsta); the weakness of sterling to the euro; the closure of Buzz for the month of April and Ryanair's 
commitment to offer the lowest fares in every market it serves," the airline said.
 Ryanair's operating costs rose by 29 pct and after tax margins declined from 20 pct to 18 pct.
    Of the 14 pct decline in yields during the quarter, 6 pct was due to the weakness of sterling. This yield dilution 
was partially offset by sterling cost savings.
    The airline's margins have also been diluted by the operation of less efficient Buzz BAe146 aircraft on some 
routes, but these will be replaced by larger and lower cost 737-800s in October following the next set of deliveries 
from Boeing.
    Yesterday Ryanair reported its July traffic statistics -- traffic was up 40 pct versus last year and load factor was 
85 pct, up 6 points on June.
CORRECTION - Ryanair Q1 profit in line; repeats FY guidance
    Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the only "grey cloud" on Ryanair's commercial horizon at present is the 
continuing EU investigation of its operation at Brussels Charleroi Airport.
    He called on the European Commission to send a "strong signal" to the market that it will not allow political 
lobbying or local court orders to prevent Ryanair making air travel more affordable.
    "We remain confident that Commissioner de Palacio will support competition and low fare air travel and will 
support the right of publicly owned airports to compete on an equal basis with privately owned airports for this 
business," O'Leary said.
    Ryanair shares closed in London on Monday at 418 pence, valuing the airline at 4.62 bln stg.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based low cost airline, has reported a 12 pct increase in first-quarter adjusted net 
profit and signalled the price war in European air fares is set to continue by reiterating guidance that it expects its 
yields, or average fares, this year to be 10 to 15 pct lower than last year.
    The airline also repeated its prediction that year to end-March 2004 profits will grow "materially" and that it will 
maintain net margins in excess of 20 pct.
    But chief executive Michael O'Leary cautioned the European Union's continuing investigation into assistance 
Ryanair received in setting up operations at Brussels Charleroi Airport in 2001 represents a "grey cloud" on its 
commercial horizon.
    For the first quarter to June 30 2003 Ryanair notched up an adjusted profit after tax (adjusted net profit) of 43.8 
mln eur -- a performance in-line with sector analysts' expectations and a 12 pct increase on last year's 39.0 mln eur.
    The figure excluded 2.7 mln eur of exceptional costs arising from the reorganisation of Buzz following its 
purchase from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV in the spring and a 0.6 mln eur goodwill charge relating to the same 
deal.
    Revenue was up 26 pct to 245.2 mln eur, operating profit increased 17 pct to 53.1 mln eur and adjusted EPS 
increased 12 pct to 5.8 cents. Operating costs rose by 29 pct and after tax margins declined from 20 pct to 18 pct.
    Passenger traffic grew by 45 pct to 5.1 mln, although both average load factors -- the number of passengers as a 
proportion of the number of seats available -- and yields declined by 5 points to 78 pct and by 14 pct to 41.71 eur 
respectively.
 "These predicted reductions were due to the launch of 50 new routes and two new bases (Milan-Bergamo and 
Stockholm-Skavsta); the weakness of sterling to the euro; the closure of Buzz for the month of April and Ryanair's 
commitment to offer the lowest fares in every market it serves," the airline said.
    Of the 14 pct decline in yields during the quarter, 6 pct was due to the weakness of sterling. The yield dilution 
was partially offset by sterling cost savings.
    The airline's margins were also diluted by the operation of less efficient Buzz BAe146 aircraft on some routes, 
but these will be replaced by larger and lower cost 737-800s in October following the next set of deliveries from 
Boeing.
ROUNDUP Ryanair Q1 net profit up 12 pct; price war to continue
    Ryanair's deputy chief executive Michael Cawley told AFX News the airline is determined to keep up the 
pressure on the flag carriers and other low fare carriers such as easyJet PLC, while at the same time deterring new 
entrants, by aggressively promoting low fares.
    Yesterday Ryanair reported its July statistics -- passenger traffic was up 40 pct versus last year and load factor 
was 85 pct, up 6 points on June.
    Cawley said he expected a load factor of over 80 pct for August and September.
    "Through the rest of the year, we're not sure. But we will certainly have very high load factors, perhaps high 70s," 
he said, adding he is hopeful the full-year load factor will touch 80 pct versus the 84 pct achieved last year.
    He anticipates Ryanair will carry over 23 mln passengers this year, up from 15.7 mln last.
    Turning to the Charleroi issue, which has acted as a drag on Ryanair's share price, O'Leary called on the 
European Commission to send a "strong signal" to the market that it will not allow political lobbying or local court 
orders to prevent Ryanair making air travel more affordable.
    "We remain confident that Commissioner de Palacio will support competition and low fare air travel and will 
support the right of publicly owned airports to compete on an equal basis with privately owned airports for this 
business," he said. News on the EU's investigation is not expected until October.
    Last month, following a complaint from Air France, an administrative court in Strasbourg ruled illegal a funding 
package granted to Ryanair by the city's Chamber of Commerce for services to Entzheim airport. Ryanair is 
appealing the decision.
    Meanwhile, Cawley said the airline plans to open another European base in February next year.
    The new hub will be announced in October or November and will be in the UK, Spain, Germany, France or Italy.
    Merrill Lynch repeated its 'buy' stance and 7 eur target price.
    It noted that Ryanair's first quarter operating profit was some 6.6 mln eur better than its expectation, reflecting 
better cost control than it had assumed.
    Nevertheless, the broker said it was unlikely to change its full year to end-March 2004 operating profit forecast of 
301.5 mln eur.
    "There is clearly a risk that 'fallen angel' status could stick to Ryanair, and that the current slowdown in earnings 
growth could emerge as a defining moment in the progression of the shares," Merrill noted.
    "But we believe the business model is increasingly different from competitors, is a proven one, and we are still 
looking at an airline operator which looks set to deliver net margins of 20 pct consistently going forward."
    At 12.12 pm Ryanair shares were down 1/2 pence in London at 417-1/2.

- Better-than-expected results helped shares of Credit Suisse Group on Tuesday, but other European banks didn't 
fare as well in U.S. trading.
Credit Suisse  shares rose 63 cents to $32.05 after the Swiss investment-banking group announced a second-
quarter profit that exceeded analysts' expectations and said it's on track to meet its full-year profit outlook.
But a warning of an uncertain full-year outlook from the Royal Bank of Scotland helped to keep the rest of the 
banking sector in check. HSBC Holdings  fell $1.10 to $61.88, while Barclays  closed down 72 cents at $29.12.
Overall, U.S.-listed shares of European companies fell. The Bank of New York European ADR Index closed down 
0.29 at 89.22.
Dutch insurer Aegon  was off 16 cents to $12.59 after it sold most of its Transamerica Finance unit to General 
Electric's  GE Commercial Finance for $5.4 billion.
Shares of French engineering group Alstom  rose a penny to $3.58 after the company postponed an announcement 
on how it will shore up its liquidity. The French government may take a 30 percent stake in the company to help bail 
it out, media reports said.
Mobile operator Vodafone Group  fell 9 cents to $18.75 after it said it would buy Project Telecom, a corporate 
telecom provider, in a cash deal that values PT at $249.4 million.
Online travel group Lastminute.com  climbed $3.02, or 17 percent, to $20.77 after it posted a third-quarter profit and 
said it was confident of a "positive outcome" for the full year.
Low-fare airline Ryanair Holdings  rose 65 cents to $41.65 after it said operating revenue for the quarter ending in 
June rose 26 percent to $278 million.

- HSBC's report of better-than-expected profit helped U.S.-listed shares of European companies start the week on a 
positive note Monday.
The Bank of New York European ADR Index closed up 0.59 at 89.51.
HSBC  rose $1.64, or 3 percent, to $63 after reporting that its first-half pretax profit rose 21 percent to $6.11 billion. 
Looking ahead, the company said it was positioning itself for a modest and uneven economic recovery and said that 
its prospects for the rest of 2003 are "reasonable."
Memory chip maker Infineon Technologies  climbed 41 cents or 3 percent, to $13.49 after its chairman told a 
German newspaper that Infineon is mulling a dividend payment in 2004 due to the firm's increasing profitability.
French engineering group Alstom  edged higher by a penny to $3.58. The company suspended trading of its stock 
in Europe earlier, saying it is in advanced negotiations to strengthen its balance sheet, refinance debt, and ensure 
its liquidity. The company said it will issue a press release following a board meeting on Tuesday.
Dutch mail and logistics group TPG  rose 33 cents to $18.80 as investors weighed the details of the company's 
restructuring plan. Earlier, TGP said net income in the first half eased 1.7 percent to $321.5 million, or 283 million 
euros. The company also said it would promote an executive from within the company to head its logistics division.
German pharmaceutical Altana  fell $2.75, or 5 percent, to $57.70 after it reported first-half pre-tax profit had come 
in slightly below what most analysts were expecting. Profit increased 25 percent to $373.8 million, or 329 million 
euro. Altana also reiterated its sales and profits forecasts for the full year.
Shire Pharmaceuticals  lost 15 cents to $22.65 after Credit Suisse First Boston downgraded its stock from 
"outperform" to "neutral." CSFB said while it approves of Shire's new strategy, that strategy also involves 
meaningful execution risk.
Deutsche Bank  fell 60 cents to $62.17. The bank's stock has fallen since it reported disappointing earnings last 
week.
Shares of Ryanair  were down 81 cents at $41. The company is scheduled to report its quarterly results Tuesday.

(Updating with further comments from Ryanair)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Luton-based no-frills airline, said it carried 2.04 mln passengers in July, compared 
with 1.46 mln a year ago, bringing the total number of passengers to 17.91 mln for the past 12 months.
    The airline's load factor -- the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available -- fell to 85 
pct from 93 pct.
 Internet sales accounted for 94 pct of tickets sold, compared with 92 pct in the same month last year and in the 12 
months to end-July.
    Ryanair's head of communications, Paul Fitzsimmons, said the figure of 2 mln passengers in a month is a new 
record for Ryanair, and for a low fares airline outside the US.
    "This strong growth confirms that Ryanair is on track to carry 24 mln passengers in a full year," he said.

(Updating with further comments by O'Leary from 4th para)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based no-frills airline may suspend its Strasbourg-London Stansted route after 
a French court ruled as illegal aid a funding package granted to Ryanair for its services from London to the city's 
Entzheim airport, chairman Michael O'Leary said.
    "The big question for us over the next two weeks will be whether we will suspend flights to Strasbourg while we 
launch our appeal, or whether we will continue to operate the route during the appeal," O'Leary said.
    "There is a real possibility, or a real danger, that we will simply pull out of Strasbourg," he added.
    O'Leary said that while Ryanair's appeal is pending, the subsidy payments will be suspended, meaning that the 
airline will have to either raise fares or cut service.
    Prices could jump by as much as 10 stg per passenger, making Strasbourg "one of the most expensive airports 
for Ryanair in Europe," O'Leary said.
    But he said he is not concerned by the possibility that the ruling of the Strasbourg court may be confirmed and 
become law, thereby threatening payments made by other French communities to Ryanair.
    "We have 40 other airports all over Europe who want us to fly there," he said.
    "It will simply mean that in France there is no competition, there are no low fares."
    On the formal inquiry by the European Union's executive commission into assistance it received in setting up 
operations in Charleroi, Belgium in 2001, O'Leary said: "I believe we will win the Charleroi case."
 However, he added that he is now "more worried" about the outcome following what he describes as the "bizarre, 
stupid, crazy" decision of the Strasbourg court.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based no-frills airline, said it will mount an immediate appeal against the 
judgement made by the local court in Strasbourg concerning Ryanair and Strasbourg airport.
    A Strasbourg administrative court ruled as illegal aid a funding package granted to Ryanair by the local Chamber 
of Commerce for its services from London to the city's Entzheim airport.
 "We are extremely disappointed that the court did not follow the opinion of the government appointed 
commissioner to the court. It is beyond belief that the court sees no benefits to Strasbourg or the region in terms of 
tourism, jobs and promotion of the region from the massively increased passenger numbers that Ryanair has 
delivered to Strasbourg and the region," Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs, Jim Callaghan, commented.
    The case against Ryanair was brought by Air France's Brit Air subsidiary, who claimed that the decision by the 
local Chamber of Commerce to grant Ryanair a payment of 560,000 eur per year to buy advertising space to 
publicise the route is tantamount to illegal aid rather than a commercial transaction.
    "The fact that Air France carried the same numbers of passengers on the route before Ryanair arrived as they 
did after Ryanair arrived has been totally ignored by this court," said Callaghan.
    Since commencing the route in November 2002, Ryanair has delivered an additional 110,000 passengers to 
Strasbourg and the region.
    "Air France claimed unfair competition forced them off the London-Strasbourg route, however they have also 
terminated seven other routes from Strasbourg, which do not compete with Ryanair, confirming that Air France has 
no commitment to Strasbourg or indeed the region," he said.

Duesseldorf.
 Ryanair had advertised the destination as Niederrhein (Duesseldorf) but the court ruled the name was misleading 
as the Niederrhein airport is 70 kilometres from Duesseldorf.

    Ryanair flies three times daily from Niederrhein to London-Stansted airport, putting it in competition with German

Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of the EasyJet PLC airline, has been forced to overhaul his EasyCar car rental 
business as it continues to lose money and confirmed that the company's flotation would be delayed, the Financial 
Times reported citing the businessman.
    Haji-Ioannou said EasyCar should aim to replicate the business model of Ryanair, its rival.
"EasyCar should try to be the absolute lowest cost producer in the car rental business, so I think it aspires to be 
closer to Ryanair than EasyJet," he is reported as saying.
    Ryanair has stuck to the no-frills model of using secondary airports, while EasyJet flies to more costly 
mainstream airports.
    Haji-Ioannou founded EasyJet in 1995. Although he is still the biggest shareholder, he stepped down as 
chairman last year, and is no longer involved in the running of the airline.
    A flotation of EasyCar has been put on hold until 2005 "at the earliest". Originally Haji- Ioannou had planned to 
bring the business to market next year.

Singapore Airlines Ltd's (SIA) former chief executive officer Cheong Choong Kong said budget carriers may 
struggle to succeed in Asia unlike their counterparts in US and Europe.
    "Asia is very unlike the homogenous, unregulated markets of the US and European Union in which (the US') 
Southwest Airlines and (Ireland's) Ryanair thrive," Cheong said in a recent speech before the Singapore Institute of 
International Affairs.
 "I cannot think of any clearly successful low-cost, no-frills airlines other than these two, and aviation history is 
littered with the carcasses of those who attempted the same model and died an ignominious death," he said.
    The success story of Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia has prompted SIA to consider the possibility of entering 
the low-cost airline market.
    On June 12, SIA said it is studying the possibility of starting a new budget airline in the region, with the company 
expecting to make a decision this year.
    Meanwhile, former SIA managing director Lim Chin Beng, alongwith a group of other Singapore businessmen, 
has announced plans to launch a no-frills airline called ValuAir.
    "SIA has never shied away from a fight; if a threat emerges on its home ground, it should not hesitate to deliver a 
swift response. Go for the knock-out," said Cheong.

Lord Marshall, chairman of British Airways PLC, has reiterated that the company's first quarter results will continue 
to mirror the difficulties faced by the the world aviation industry.
    "The result for the first quarter of the current financial year will not be known until the end of this month, but it can 
be expected to reflect a continuing, difficult situation for the world air transport industry," he told shareholders during 
the company's annual meeting.
    The industry, he stressed, is in a state of "despair and disarray", having gone through a series of catastrophes 
over the past two years, with 2002 going down as the "worst ever" for airlines.
    "Already weakened by the lasting effects of 9/11 and persistent economic decline, the threat of war in the Middle 
East emerged to bring further uncertainty and reduced demand in the global market place," he said.
    The US-led invasion of Iraq had "inevitable consequences" for the industry, particularly for BA which has 
significant Middle East networks.
    "As if this was not enough, the last month of a fateful financial review saw the disastrous occurrence of the 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome," he stressed.
    Rod Eddington, the chief executive, stressed that the outlook for the market remains uncertain.
    "While loads are improving, yields are still under pressure," he added.
    The group's efforts will continue to focus on reducing costs, which have resulted in 10,000 job cuts across its 
operations. A further 3,000 jobs are to go later this year.
 It has so far achieved annualised savings of 570 mln stg, against its target of 450 mln.
    Executives noted that initial outcome of its efforts to compete with no-frills airlines like Ryanair, which have 
thrived during these uncertain times, has been encouraging.
    Last year, it rolled out a new short-haul low fares model in the UK domestic market, scrapping traditional 
restrictions on tickets. This was eventually extended across Europe on 6,500 flights a week on 180 routes.
    "The traffic levels since tell us that the new fares have been a big success… They also show that we can take on 
the no-frills carriers and compete effectively with them," Eddington said.
BA 's Marshall says Q1 results to 'reflect' troubles of global aviation market
    BA.com, its new on-line booking website, has doubled its share from 20 pct to 40 pct of its short-haul "non-
premium" bookings, he said.
    "We now sell over 50 pct of this market through our direct channels."
    BA.com is currently generating daily revenue of over 1 mln stg a day. Last April, that level of turnover was 
achieved on a weekly basis.
    On-line bookings have also increased by 10-30 pct per country after it launched four new languages on the 
website two months ago, he added.
    Amid the uncertainty, BA had declined to commit when dividend payments will be restored.
    "The best long-term interests of this company and shareholders' investments in it, call for cash to be retained in 
these uncertain times," Marshall said.
    "The payment of dividends in the future will be kept under review by your board and will depend on results and 
prospects," he said.

    "The best long-term interests of this company and shareholders' investments in it, call for cash to be retained in 
these uncertain times," Marshall said.
    "The payment of dividends in the future will be kept under review by your board and will depend on results and 
prospects," he said.
    Commenting on the consolidation of the European airline industry, Eddington highlighted the significant role that 
Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA, the Spanish flag carrier, could play in BA's attempt to be part of that process.
    BA owns a 10 pct stake in Iberia.
    "Iberia is our major European partner and we will continue to find ways to build on the relationship," Eddington 
said.
    Iberia will be a key candidate should BA decide to "seek a partner" in taking part in the consolidation process in 
Europe, he told shareholders.
    Iberia's operations are "highly complementary" to BA, and the Spanish carrier "will not be a burden" to the British 
airline should they decide to "extend (their) partnership" in the future, he added, failing to elaborate.
    At the moment, however, BA's strategy is to focus on "restoring (its) fortunes" following the losses it made last 
year, Eddington said.
    Early this year, BA and Iberia, also its One World Alliance partner, extended their code-sharing arrangements.

Shares in Dublin-based no-frills airline Ryanair could fly into trouble this morning as JP Morgan cut its ratings and 
earnings estimates amid concerns about weaker earnings growth year due to excessive capacity expansion.
    The broker, which is trimming its EPS estimates for this year by 4 pct, cut its stance on the airline from 
'overweight' to 'neutral'.
    "We believe longer term investors should consider using any price weakness over the coming months to add to 
holdings below our preferred entry level of 5.5 eur," the broker concluded.

- U.S.-listed shares of European companies couldn't keep pace with major indexes but still managed to end the 
week in positive territory, bolstered by strength in insurers and airlines.
The Bank of New York European ADR Index gained 0.80 to finish at 88.24.
The Nasdaq Composite rose 18 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 1,734 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
added 84, 0.9 percent, points to 9,120.
Shares of Royal & Sun Alliance  put a positive finish on the week, rising 52 cents, or 4.6 percent, at $11.85. The 
company's insurance financial strength rating was downgraded last week by Moody's to "Baa2" from "Baa1," as the 
rating agency noted concerns that it may have to inject capital into its U.S. operations.
Elsewhere in the insurance arena, Aegon  jumped 25 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $11.10 as it unveiled a new 
organization structure for its Dutch operations that it said was aimed at streamlining business groups.
Prudential  also entered the weekend on a high-note, up 49 cents, or 3.8 percent, at $13.54.
Separately, New Skies Satellites  ended a volatile week as the index's top advancer. The provider of video, Internet, 
voice and data communications services soared 63 cents, or 14 percent, to $5.14 but still down from Monday's 
opening level of $5.46.
Finally, Ryanair  paced upbeat action in the airline segment, surging $1.82, or 4.5 percent, to $41.84. British 
Airways  flew 2.5 percent higher, closing at $28.52 while KLM Royal Dutch  added 21 cents, or 2.4 percent, to 
$9.11.

(Updating to add background)
     easyJet PLC, the Luton-based no-frills airline, said it carried 82.7 pct more passengers in June year-on-year.
    Its monthly traffic report revealed it carried 1.75 mln passengers in June versus 958,857 last year, bringing the 
total number of passengers to 18.94 mln for the last 12 months.
 The airline's load factor -- the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available -- fell to 85.8 
pct from 86.6 pct last June.
    The figures include those for Go Fly, acquired by easyJet last August.
    "These figures are in line with our own expectations," said chief executive Ray Webster.
    "We are pleased with easyJet's June performance, given the events that have adversely affected the airline 
market recently. These results demonstrate, for both business and leisure customers, the continuing attractiveness 
of our fare structures and the airports selected for our network."
    easyJet will issue a trading update on July 22.
    Last week Ryanair Holdings PLC, easyJet's fierce rival, revealed a 9 pct fall in its June load factor to 79 pct, 
sending its share price down 6.5 pct.
    easyJet shares, which have come off a 2003 high of 298 pence, closed Friday at 242 pence, capitalising the 
airline at 948 mln stg.
    Ryanair shares closed Friday at 406 pence.

TBI PLC said its four European airports handled 3.6 mln passengers in the April-June quarter, a rise of 19.5 pct 
from 3 mln in the same period last year, driven by growth in low-cost traffic.
    TBI operates the London Luton, Belfast International and Cardiff International airports in the UK and Stockholm-
Skavsta in Sweden.
 The company said low-cost traffic increased by 37.1 pct to 2.6 mln passengers. Full-service traffic fell to 233,600 
passengers, in line with expectations, while charter reduced by 2.1 pct to 791,300 passengers.
    "The charter figures are particularly respectable given the pressures facing this market during the period under 
review including the Gulf War and the weakening pound," said TBI.
    The Cardiff and Stockholm airports achieved the highest growth rates during the quarter. Traffic at Cardiff 
International rose 35.6 pct, boosted by bmibaby's establishment of its second UK base at the airport. Stockholm-
Skavsta saw traffic surge by 260.5 pct, primarily through Ryanair Holdings PLC launching its Scandinavian base at 
the airport.

easyJet, the Luton-based no frills airline, said it is disappointed that the European Parliament rejected three 
principal recommendations to improve legislation for victims of overbooking and cancellations.
    While easyJet said it supports the aim of the legislation, it believes that the precise legislation is misguided.
 The airline group believes that compensation should be related to the fare that a passenger paid, rather than a flat 
rate fine, and said it contravenes the EU's own legislation as it applies to only one form of transport, and not to rail 
services, coaches, ferries etc.
    easyJet added that it is "very disappointed" that the European Parliament has voted not to compile and publish 
league tables showing the different service standards of each European airline in a verified and audited format.
    "What the European Parliament has voted through today is a nonsense," said Ray Webster, easyJet chief 
executive.
    Yesterday, the European parliament approved tough new rules forcing airlines to make generous compensation 
payments for victims of overbooking and cancellations.
    The legislation will force airlines to pay passengers 250 eur for flights of less than 1,500 km, 400 eur for flights 
between 1,500-3,500 km, and 600 eur for flights longer than 3,500 km.

The European parliament approved tough new rules forcing airlines to make generous compensation payments for 
victims of overbooking and cancellations, the Financial Times reported.
    The legislation will force airlines to pay passengers 250 eur for flights of less than 1,500 km, 400 eur for flights 
between 1,500-3,500 km, and 600 eur for flights longer than 3,500 km.
 The measures strengthen EU legislation covering compensation and extend it to include charter flights.
    Airlines will also be forced to provide passengers affected by significant delays with refreshments, meals and 
even hotels in cases where they are stranded in an airport overnight.
    Most full-service airlines already operate such schemes on a voluntary basis.
    But the International Air Transport Association said the measures could be "counter-productive", forecasting that 
budget fares could well rise, the newspaper reported.    
    EasyJet chief executive Ray Webster described the legislation as "nonsense", adding that "levels of 
compensation should be related to the fares passengers have paid."

Leading shares are expected to open higher this morning following the sharp gains on Wall Street, although activity 
will be limited ahead of this afternoon's key US labour market report, dealers said.
     According to spread betting firm City Index, the FTSE 100 will open 25 points higher at around 4,031.
    Overnight, the DJIA gained 101.89 points to close at 9,142.84, while the Nasdaq composite ran up 38.60 points 
to end the day at 1,678.73.
    And the buying spree continued in Asia. The Nikkei 225 index went into the afternoon session 148.98 points 
higher at 9741.22, while the Hang Seng finished the morning up 32.66 points at 9,635.28.
    The market's main focus will be this afternoon's US labour market report, although, with most US investors 
having already packed their bags for the Independence Day weekend, the numbers will have to be dramatically out 
of kilter to have an impact on equity markets.
    Economists are looking for June payrolls to be unchanged from the previous month, when the payroll fell by 
17,000, while the jobless rate is expected to have risen slightly to 6.2 pct from 6.1 pct.
    After that attention will shaft to the June ISM survey of the US services industry, whose June headline index is 
expected to have risen to 55.0, from 54.5 in May.
    This morning, the UK's CIPS service-sector index is forecast to tick up to 52.2 in June, from 51.9 in May.
    In the financial sector, HSBC is expected to open higher after the financial services group announced late 
yesterday that it will shed 1,400 jobs in the UK by the end of the year.
Most of the cuts will be at branches in London, Southampton and Birmingham, it added.
    Airlines stocks will be in focus after solid gains from their US counterparts overnight following a positive Merrill 
Lynch research note. There will also be a raft of June traffic statistics from some of Europe's biggest players -- 
KLM, BA and Ryanair are also expected to deliver new numbers on passenger traffic in June.
    But sector followers warned that gains may be capped by caution ahead of a key ruling in the UK Court of 
Appeals today on Deep Vein Thrombosis. Should the Court rule that DVT is an accident, rather than just an 
naturally occurring phenomenon, it would clear the path for billions of pounds of claims against the major carriers 
under the Warsaw Convention governing airline liability.

    Elsewhere, UK engineering and semiconductor ceramics maker Cookson's second quarter trading update is 
expected to reveal further progress year-on-year.

More no-frills airlines may take off in Asia to meet increasing consumer demand following the success story of 
Malaysia's budget carrier AirAsia, industry experts said.
    The push for countries such as China and Indonesia to set up budget airlines, such as those in the US and 
Europe was fuelled by market demand and profitability, analysts told Agence France-Presse.
    Asia could be next in line for the budget boom, Peter Foggin, London-based senior vice-president of DVB Bank 
AG, said.
    "That would not surprise me at all because of the success of the USA's Southwest Airlines, the UK's EasyJet and 
Ireland's RyanAir. And now you see the success of AirAsia in the last 18 months. People will say if they (AirAsia) 
can do it, I can do it also," he said.
    Commenting on plans by Singapore Airlines (SIA) to possibly launch a budget carrier, Foggin said: "They see the 
success of AirAsia. They know how big the market is and how good the opportunity is in Asia."
    SIA has this year floated plans to enter the budget carrier market, mulling the idea of converting its regional wing, 
SilkAir, or establishing a separate airline.
    SIA said on June 12 it would make a decision by the end of the year after a task force set up to look into the 
feasibility of a low-cost outfit completed its study.
    Former SIA managing director Lim Chin Beng has also begun moves to set up a regional budget airline in 
potential competition with his former employer.
 AirAsia Friday named three foreign partners who will inject 26 mln usd to enable the 18-month old profit-making 
carrier to buy new aircraft to expand its business.
    The investors are the Bahrain-based Islamic Development Bank (IDB), Gulf-linked Crescent Venture Partners 
and Deucalion Capital, a Frankfurt-based global private equity fund.
    Foggin said besides Singapore, budget carriers are expected to emerge in China and Indonesia.
    "China, Indonesia, definitely, we will see low-cost carriers taking off," he said.
    Azrul Azwar, an economist with MIDF Sisma Holdings Sdn Bhd, expressed similar sentiments, saying the huge 
populations and large geographical areas of the two countries were encouraging factors for budget airlines.
More budget airlines in Asia seen on strong demand - industry experts
    "I think there seems to be a new trend in Asia to jump onto the bandwagon. There is big potential in China and 
Indonesia for this business," he told AFP.
    AirAsia chief executive Tony Fernandes said the region offered vast opportunities for budget carriers.
    "I think there is a lot of potential. Sure some countries will start low-cost business carriers," he said.
    But Foggin cautioned potential players, saying that AirAsia entered the business with many advantages which 
new individuals may not have.
    "AirAsia has built a great platform with a low-cost base which appeals to passengers to fly. It has a large 
domestic market as only 6.0 pct of the 23 mln population have flown," he said.
    Azrul said AirAsia's impressive start could be challenged by new budget carriers if it does not move faster to 
expand regionally.
    "It has raised new funds to acquire new aircraft, it could add regional destinations before competition comes in," 
he said.
    Azrul also said that AirAsia could form strategic alliances with foreign carriers.
    "AirAsia could fly the foreign tourists when they arrive in the country directly to under-served and remote areas in 
Malaysia or in the region," he said.
    But Fernandes maintained that AirAsia was unfazed by the possibility of competition from SIA or other countries, 
saying it would not be rushed into going regional.
    "I am very surprised SIA is going budget. I think they are losing focus. It is like Rolls Royce saying it will launch 
mini cars. I am in no rush to go regional," he said.

(Updating to add Ryanair's comments)
 Ryanair PLC has been fined 20,000 dkr by a Danish court in Aarhus, Denmark, for having infringed the law when 
advertising its fares.
    Ryanair was charged with advertising in the press on 11 occasions two different airfares -- one without including 
taxes, and the other including taxes, but in small print.
 The government consumer protection agency filed the suit against Ryanair after complaints by some of its 
competitors, including Scandinavian Airlines System.
    The court did not include advertisements dating from more than two years ago.
    Ryanair lawyer Kim Ulrich said he was satisfied with the ruling, saying "it shows that this is a matter between 
SAS and Maersk Air on one side and Ryanair on the other, and not consumer dissatisfaction."
    The carrier's deputy director, Warrick Brady, was quoted by Danish news agency Ritzau as saying that 
management would study the ruling before deciding whether to file an appeal.
    "We were given a symbolic fine because our advertisements were not detailed enough, but this whole affair is an 
attempt by SAS and Maersk Air to limit the competition from low-cost airlines," he said.
    Three Danish newspapers, Jyllands-Posten, Aarhus Stifstidende and Nordjyske Stifstidende, also faced charges 
for publishing the ads, but the court acquitted them on the grounds that newspaper editors' responsibilities could not 
be extended to advertisements.

The US Center for Financial Research and Analysis (CFRA) has issued a report on Ryanair Holdings PLC's 
accounts, warning that the company faces a downturn in demand and declining free cashflow, the Sunday Times 
reported.
    The CFRA, which the newspaper described as one of the US' top independent analysts, also said that Ryanair 
overstated operating cashflow in its 2001-2 results, the paper added.

The Irish low-cost airline Ryanair was charged in a Danish court for misleading advertising and illegal business 
practices, a judicial source said.
    A Danish state consumer protection agency filed the charges in Aarhus, central Denmark, following complaints 
by several companies including Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS).
 The Irish carrier had published 112 advertisements offering rock-bottom prices that did not include value-added 
taxes or airport taxes and which were therefore said to be in violation of Danish laws.
    Three Danish newspapers -- Jyllands-Posten, Aarhus Stifstidende and Nordjyske Stifstidende -- have been 
charged with carrying advertising that did not clearly indicate product prices.
    Ryanair has acknowledged responsibility in 13 cases and subsequently changed its ads to respect Danish 
legislation.
    A Ryanair lawyer, Kim Ulrick, told the court that the company "had received no complaints from customers 
concerning the advertising practices and that only SAS and other companies had complained".
    Ryanair representative Jim Callaghan said the practices corresponded to those used by the Irish carrier 
elsewhere in Europe.
    A verdict is expected within two weeks, but Ryanair also faces similar charges in Sweden brought by the 
Swedish consumers council and SAS.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said that with effect from June 30 it will no longer accept the American Express charge card.
    In order to continue to offer even lower fares to consumers and as part of its ongoing cost reduction programme, 
Ryanair said it will no longer accept what it called the "excessive charges" levied by American Express.
    Ryanair said American Express' charges are substantially higher than those of the other major credit card 
issuers.

easyJet PLC, the Luton-based no-frills airline, has begun a Europe-wide "beauty parade" for new airports to fly to.
    It said adverts have been placed in national newspapers throughout Europe asking airports to tender for its 
business.
    easyJet, which currently flies 105 routes between 38 European airports, stressed it applies "strict criteria" to its 
airport development.
    In a clear dig at arch rival Ryanair Holdings PLC, the airline said it is "not looking for irrelevant airstrips miles from 
anywhere -- we only want airports prepared to offer easy-to-use facilities with good access to a large, attractive 
population."
    easyJet wants potential airport customers to pursue a self-selection process by checking they conform to criteria 
set out on the airline's website (easyJet.com).
    "There are numerous opportunities for growth in Europe and at any one time we are always talking to scores of 
airports. Our only dilemma is narrowing down the mountain of opportunities to the one or two airports that we will 
select each year," said easyJet chief executive Ray Webster at the ACI Europe annual conference.
    "In line with the way we run all aspects of our business, we have decided to be open with our requirements rather 
than doing everything behind closed-doors.
    "By applying very strict criteria, we are essentially outsourcing the selection process to the airports themselves. 
Airports that don't conform to our requirements will not be considered in our beauty parade."
    An easyJet spokeswoman added that the search is primarily focused on new destinations for next winter and 
summer, but did not rule out the airline adding another continental European base to its existing three of Paris, 
Amsterdam and Geneva.
 At 12.10 pm easyJet shares were up 4-3/4 pence at 201-3/4.

- Shares of European companies trading American depositary shares finished the day mostly lower Thursday, but 
with a few bright spots.
Nokia  shares were the most active, with 16.6 million trading hands. The stock fell 53 cents, or 3 percent, to $17.27 
after HSBC cut it to "reduce."
HSBC said it is concerned that the Nokia average selling price in Europe is flat, causing the broker to doubt that 
handset sales will turn higher at the end of the year. Meanwhile, it believes Ericsson  has room to offer upside 
potential from its restructuring and upgraded the shares to "add."
Ericsson shares rose 5 cents to close at $11.82 on volume of 4.6 million shares.
Vodafone Group  shares climbed 14 cents to $21.14 with 3.4 million shares changing hands.
Telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel  was off 28 cents, or 3 percent, at $9.44.
The drug group was active, starting with GlaxoSmithKline , which agreed to pay Pozen up to $160 million to 
develop combination painkillers to fight migraine headaches. Glaxo shares finished down 71 cents at $41.80.
Novartis  shares gave back 44 cents to $40.46 after the U.S. International Trade Commission said a dispute over 
the antibiotic Augmentin should go to trial. That ruling reverses a prior ITC decision.
News that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index will add STMicroelectronics  along with Taiwan Semiconductor  
sparked interest in the stock, with some 3 million shares changing hands, but did little to help its price, down 87 
cents, or 4 percent, at $21.91. Lattice Semiconductor  is being dropped from the index .
ASML  moved up 18 cents at $10.35 on volume of 3 million shares after it announced its MaskTools division is in a 
software licensing agreement with Nanya Technology of Taiwan.
Carnival  shares gained 66 cents to $32.46 as the tourism group benefited from the World Health Organization 
saying the SARS epidemic was nearing an end.
Ryanair  shares were off 19 cents at $40.64 after ABN Amro said Ryanair investors should switch into rival EasyJet. 
The broker said Ryanair is suffering from weak yields and traffic demand due to its acquisition of Buzz.
Wall Street - European ADRs Busy day closes mixed for drug, telecom sectors
Explaining the day's active, but lackluster trading action, Credit Lyonnais European equities trader Shawn Diamond 
said: "Traders don't want to pick tops, but market conditions are such that they may be seeing one."
Shares of the Bank of New York European ADR Index closed unchanged at 93.23.

Leading shares are expected to open slightly higher this morning, taking heart from another firm performance 
across US markets last night, although profit taking after a positive week could limit gains, dealers said.
      According to spread betting firm IG Index, the FTSE 100 is seen opening around 25 points higher at around 
4,135.
    On Wall Street over night, the DJIA managed to hold on to its gains, closing above the 9,000 level for the second 
session in a row, despite weaker than expected employment data and a slew of negative news from the retail 
sector, traders noted.
    In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index began the afternoon 16.69 points higher at 8,673.92, while the Hang Seng ended its 
morning session up 15.72 points at 9,654.73.
    On the economic front today, a slew of US data should provide further clues as to the health of the world's largest 
economy, with US nonfarm payrolls and unemployment data for May both expected to be keenly followed, while 
April consumer credit data will also be pored over.
    The May unemployment rate is forecast at 6.1 pct, up from 6.0 pct in April, while non-farm payrolls are expected 
to fall by 27,000 in May and average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.2 pct, after growing 0.1 pct in April.
    In company news, technology stocks could come under pressure in early deals after Intel tightened its guidance 
after the bell last night in its midquarter update.
    The chip giant narrowed its second-quarter sales range to between 6.6 bln usd and 6.8 bln usd from an original 
range of between 6.4 bln and 7 bln.
The chipmaker said its main processor unit is trending toward the high end of a normal seasonal pattern while 
communications products sales remain soft.
    Elsewhere, Xstrata should benefit from news overnight that MIM Holdings shareholders have voted in favour of 
accepting Xstrata's 1.72 bln aud takeover of the company.
    Speaking at the shareholders meeting, MIM's chairman Leo Tutt said Xstrata's offer had received acceptances 
from 59.1 pct of shareholders and 88.9 pct of voting shares in proxy counting.
London shares outlook; seen higher as US markets manage to hold on to gains
    The travel sector should also be in focus with Easyjet's May traffic stats expected and MyTravel's interim results 
both due later today.
    Easyjet's comments will be eagerly awaited after rival Ryanair's comments on fares and volumes with its full year 
numbers earlier this week, and following words of caution from BA on Wednesday on demand in the month.

Ryanair reports in-line FY net profit; sees current yr yields down 10-15 pct

Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based no frills airline, has reported full year net profit in line with market 
expectations, but cautioned average fares (yields) will likely be 10-15 pct lower in the current year.
    "I personally expect no near term improvement in either the low fare environment or the strength of the euro, and 
believe therefore that yields for the year will continue to be 10 pct to 15 pct lower than last year," said chief 
executive Michael O'Leary.
    However, he pointed out the negative revenue effect (of weaker Sterling) will be partially compensated by lower 
Sterling costs. In addition the strength of the euro against the dollar will lower costs of aircraft acquisitions, fuel and 
spares over the coming years.
    Margins will also be diluted by the closure and relaunch of the Buzz operation (grounded for the entire month of 
April) and the negative impact of operating more expensive BAe146 aircraft on certain routes which will be replaced 
by larger and lower cost Boeing 737-800s next year.
    With the launch of 50 new routes out of a total network of 125, load factors will also decline this year to about 80 
pct.
    For the year to March 31 2003 Ryanair saw net profit increase 59 pct to 239.4 mln eur on revenue up 35 pct to 
842.5 mln eur.
    Operating costs rose at a slower rate by 26 pct. As a result Ryanair's after tax margins increased from 24 pct to 
28 pct.
 This was achieved on the back of a 42 pct increase in passenger traffic to 15.7 mln, as average load factors 
increased from 81 pct to 84 pct, primarily due to a 6 pct reduction in average fares.
    This reduction in yields was a result of continuing price promotions, the launch of over 20 new routes, a new 
base in Milan-Bergamo, and Ryanair's commitment to low fares.
    Basic earnings per share increased 54 pct to 31.71 cents.
    "The market has suffered from high fuel prices, the war in Iraq, the impact of SARS and the continuing effect of 
the economic downturn in many European countries," said O'Leary.
    "Despite these difficult conditions Ryanair's continued profitability stems from the fact that we have the lowest 
costs and the lowest air fares which no other European airline can match."
Ryanair reports in-line FY net profit; sees current yr yields down 10-15 pct
    Looking forward O'Leary expressed confidence the airline would enjoy another successful year.
    "Even though we will drive down fares and yields we expect to maintain our normal profit margins of just over 20 
pct and record our sixteenth consecutive year with a material increase in profits."
    Ryanair also published its May traffic data.
    May traffic, including the first month of the former Buzz routes, was 53 pct greater than May last year.
    Yields were down 15 pct during the month, of which 5 points is due to the weakness in sterling against the euro.
    Ryanair also announced another "low fares" seat Sale. It is selling 1 mln low fare seats at 19.99 stg and 29.99 
stg one way for travel during the peak Summer months of June, July and August.
    Ryanair shares closed Monday at 439-1/2 pence.

Shares of Ryanair Holdings, Europe's fast-growing low-fare airline, dropped as much as 14.7 percent Tuesday after 
the low-fare airline said it expects lower fares and yields this year will pressure its profit margin.
Ryanair's  said it's not expecting "near term improvement in either the low fare environment or the strength of the 
euro, and believe therefore that yields for the year will continue to be 10 percent to 15 percent lower than last year."
Ryanair said it expected to return to its "normal profit margins" of just over 20 percent in the current fiscal year, 
down from 28 percent in the year ending in March.
"Shareholders should be aware that these results for the past 12 months have been exceptional. We have 
repeatedly stated that profit margins of almost 30 percent are a one off and non-sustainable," chief executive 
Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
Ryanair's explosive traffic growth in Europe-only flights has been the envy of Europe's airline industry. The major 
long-haul carriers are struggling against a drop in traffic as SARs, Middle East turmoil and the downturn in business 
travelers impact.
"These results prove that even Ryanair is not immune to the yield weakness being experienced by the network 
airlines," Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said.
Shares in London  were last down 64.5p at 375p.
Ryanair said revenue for the year ending in March rose 35 percent to 842.5 million euro, ahead of some forecasts 
from analysts. Net profit rose 59 percent to 239.4 million euro. Passenger traffic rose 42 percent to 15.7 million.
Average load factors, a measure of passengers to seats available, rose to 84 percent from 81 percent, "primarily 
due to a 6 percent reduction in average fares," the airline said

Ryanair's outlook sets expectations of a decline of at least 10 percent in average fares for fiscal 2004, Dublin-based

drop 5 percentage points to 80 percent.
Davy cut its forecasts for this year and next year at Ryanair by 8-9 percent; it now sees earnings per share growth 
close to 10 percent in fiscal 2004.

European markets are expected to make a more cautious start to the session, hit by Nasdaq's reversal of fortunes 
overnight as US investors moved to lock in profits.
    Sentiment was also hurt by news that US tech giant IBM is facing an accounting investigation by the SEC 
centring on its revenue-recognition practices in 2000 and 2001.
    So on Monday, the Dow closed up only 47.55 points at 8,897.81, having at one point broken through the key 
9,000 level, while the Nasdaq Composite ended down 5.16 points at 1,590.75. And in Asia, the Nikkei 225 index 
went into the afternoon session down 30.16 points at 8,517.01, while the Hang Seng closed the morning 38.44 
points higher at 9,675.97. On the data front, there is little to get excited about, particularly ahead of key rate 
decisions in the euro-zone and UK later this week.
    In Europe, French consumer confidence is expected to have improved slightly in May, but will remain soft due in 
part to jitters over the social unrest in France. And in the UK, the CIPS manufacturing index is expected to show a 
slight increase to 48.7 in May, from 48.3 in April, for the second straight monthly increase.
    TMTs, which were in the vanguard of the advance yesterday, are expected to succumb to some profit-taking 
today as Nasdaq slipped into the red overnight, and on the back of the IBM probe. But chip stocks could find some 
support after TSMC chairman Morris Chang said he is "cautiously optimistic" about the company's business outlook 
for the three months to September.
He warned, however, that the company's prospects for the final quarter remain unclear.
    UK corporate results will dominate in early trade.
    UK mobile phone retailer Carphone Warehouse will face tough questions about its plans in Germany when it 
reports annual results this morning. In March, the company said it would either close its loss-making German 
business or build on it. But the group's annual figures should hold few surprises after it issued a trading update less 
than a week before its year-end. Analysts are looking for year to March pretax profits of 55.4-56.5 mln stg, up from 
46.7 mln last time.
    In the Cyclicals, all eyes will be on Ryanair, the Dublin-based no frills airline, which issued a cautiously optimistic 
trading statement alongside its in-line full year figures. Ryanair warned that the low fare environment is set to stay, 
and that load factors will remain under pressure, but it is still confident of a successful full year.
Euroshares opening - More cautious start seen as Wall Street pares gains
    And at BAA, investors will focus on SARS, the debate about runway capacity in the southeast of England and the 
impact of possible airline consolidation, when it releases its full-year results later today. Sector analysts expect 
BAA, which operates seven UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, to report a year to March pretax 
profit before exceptional items of 498-535 mln stg versus 505 mln last time. But of most importance will be BAA's 
view on the outlook.
    In the Financials, which soared yesterday on the back of rising equity markets, UK fund management firm 
Schroders will be in the spotlight when it delivers a first quarter trading update this morning. Investors are hoping for 
evidence that the flow of funds has picked up in-line with the equity market recovery so far this year. Away from 
results, BA is expected to be active after the UK flag carrier finally revealed after the close last night that it has sold 
dba. The UK group's German ops, formerly known as Deutsche BA, to a Nuremburg-based aviation consultancy, 
Intro, were sold for just 1 eur. BA will invest up to 35 mln eur in dba and underwrite the German carrier's fleet of 16 
aircraft for a year, at a cost of 3 mln eur a month.
    But Deutsche Boerse could win fresh support in opening trades as Moody's raised its outlook on the stock to 
stable from negative. AGMs are also due today from Banco Zaragozano, which is currently being bid for by UK 
banking giant Barclays, Hermes, CNP Assurances, MG Technologies and Hunter Douglas.

- London markets traded lower on Tuesday amid several corporate results, a weaker overnight and an IBM 
accounting scandal.
The FTSE 100 index  eased 1.2 percent to 4,079. European markets were also lower. .
The overnight saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreat from gains while London markets were open on 
Tuesday, finishing higher by 47 points. IBM also said it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission on its revenue recognition practices. .
British bank Barclays  fell 2.5 percent. The bank said its operating profits and operating income during the quarter 
ending March 31 are on part with last year's results. Provisions were lower in the period in Personal Financial 
Services and higher in Barclaycard and Business Banking, the group said. It did note that the restructuring charge 
for the first half of 2003 is expected to be "somewhat ahead" of the 2002 first half performance.
"The investment case remains one of low revenue growth, tight cost controls and broadly flat bad debts," said UBS 
Warburg analyst Ian Smillie in London.
Fund manager Schroders  slid 1.8 percent as it said funds under management declined 2.3 percent during the 
quarter ending March 31 to 84.2 billion pounds ($137 billion), but increased to 87.5 billion by the end of April on the 
back of stronger markets. The group saw inflows of 400 million pounds during the quarter, as net inflows in retail 
business of 1.2 billion offset 500 million pounds in outflows from institutions and 300 million in private banking.
Schroders noted that it is cautious regarding fund flows for the year.
Low-fare airline Ryanair Holdings  dropped 8.9 percent as it said it expects lower fares and yields in the current 
fiscal year, but added "we expect to maintain our normal profit margins of just over 20 percent and record our 
sixteenth consecutive year with a material increase in profits." .
Ryanair said its not expecting "near term improvement in either the low fare environment or the strength of the 
Euro, and believe therefore that yields for the year will continue to be 10 percent to 15 percent lower than last year." 
It added that the impact of a weaker Sterling will be partially compensated by lower Sterling costs.
Also in the airline sector, BAA  slid 0.3 percent as it said its 5.2 percent increase in group operating profit was the 
result of 6.5 percent growth in net retail income of 31 million pounds and a 2 percent increase in U.K. airport and 
other traffic charges of 13 million, partially offset by additional insurance and security costs.
FTSE eases, as Schroders, Barclays, BAA see losses - UPDATE 5
"Current performance continues to be adversely affected by the recent SARS virus, conflict in Iraq and continuing 
terrorist threats around the globe. However, anticipated traffic growth in the medium term and the Terminal 5 
development at Heathrow give us confidence in the future of the business," said CEO-designate Mike Clasper.
Nuclear electricity generator British Energy  was off 4.2 percent as it warned the group may face insolvency 
proceedings if its restructuring effort falters.
"Significant progress has been made but the proposed restructuring remains subject to a large number of significant 
uncertainties. If, for any reason, British Energy is unable to implement the restructuring, it may be unable to meet its 
financial obligations as they fall due, in which case it may have to take appropriate insolvency proceedings," it said.
The group posted a 4.3 billion pound loss for the fiscal 2002-2003 year. The loss mainly reflects exceptional 
charges that included a 3.6 billion pound write-down in generation plant for nuclear assets and a 151 million pound 
write-down in the value of Eggborough. No dividend to shareholders was proposed, it said. It posted a 493 million 
loss in 2001-2002 year.
Carphone Warehouse Group , the U.K. mobile phone retailer, rose 3.6 percent as said it has an agreement to buy 
German mobile service provider Hutchison Telecommunications from Orange Holdings for a total 46.8 million 
pounds. HTG has a total of 670,000 mobile customers, it said. The acquisition "creates a reliable platform for 
sustained profitable growth in Germany and extends The Carphone Warehouse's recurring revenue model to that 
country," it said.
CWG said revenue rose 60 percent in the year ending in March to 1.8 billion pounds; earnings per share before 
exceptional items rose 19 percent to 5.25p. It declared a 1p dividend for the year. Looking ahead, it said: "The 
outlook is for continued strong growth. Coupled with the group's strong cash flows, this leads us to recommend The 
Carphone Warehouse Group's first dividend and to commit to a policy of dividend growth in line with earnings 
growth."
Engineering group Invensys  rose 1 percent as it said it has an agreement to sell its Baan subsidiary, a 
manufacturing solutions and services supplier, to investors Cerberus Capital Management and General Atlantic 
Partners for $135 million in cash. The deal had been widely anticipated. Invensys said the proceeds will be used to 
pay down debt. Baan generated revenue of $265 million and an operating loss in the year to March.
Smith & Nephew  eased 0.1 percent as the CEO of Zimmer , Ray Elliot, told the Financial Times that he would let 
S&N acquire orthopedics group Centerpulse  if it outbid Zimmer. "If they go up above it by 1 pound, the business 
will be theirs," he said. Zimmer has already topped a 1.55 billion pound Smith & Nephew deal with a 1.8 billion 
pound for the Switzerland-based Centerpulse.

- Airline stocks drifted lower Tuesday morning after leading European discount airline Ryanair disclosed that it is 
feeling the effects of the airline industry's historic downturn.
The Amex Airline Index  traded down 0.1 percent.
Reflecting concern over Ryanair's disclosure that it faces profit margin pressure and weaker revenue, shares traded 
down as much as 15 percent in London action.
In New York, shares of discount specialist Southwest Airlines  fell 15 cents to $16.02.
Low-fare upstart JetBlue Airways  lost 10 cents to $33.90.
Among the larger carriers, no. 1 airline AMR Corp.  was unchanged at $6.95.
Continental Airlines'  closely watched May pricing and revenue performance data was in line with what Deutsche 
Bank airline analysts had expected. The carrier's load factor for the month rose 2.4 points to 75.9 percent. Shares 
rose 26 cents to $12.67.
"This, coupled with a solid load-factor performance supports our view that fundamentals have bottomed, supply and 
demand is in balance, and our universe of airline stocks is on track to either meet or beat [earnings per-share] 
expectations for the June quarter," wrote Deutsche Bank's Susan Donofrio.
Northwest Airlines  fell 10 cents to $9.23.
Delta Air Lines  lost 16 cents to $13.69.

- Airline stocks turned higher Tuesday morning after a Wall Street analyst said the worst of the industry's historic 
downturn may be over. But in Europe, fast-growing airline Ryanair issued a financial warning.
The Amex Airline Index  rose 0.2 percent.
Continental Airlines'  closely watched May pricing and revenue performance data was in line with what Deutsche 
Bank's airline analyst had expected. The carrier's load factor for the month rose 2.4 points to 75.9 percent. Among 
the strongest gainers, Continental shares rose 37 cents to $12.78.
"This, coupled with a solid load-factor performance supports our view that fundamentals have bottomed, supply and 
demand is in balance, and our universe of airline stocks is on track to either meet or beat [earnings per-share] 
expectations for the June quarter," wrote Deutsche Bank's Susan Donofrio.
Northwest Airlines  fell 7 cents to $9.26.
Delta Air Lines  rose 1 cent to $13.86.
These two airlines and AirTran Holdings  are Donofrio's top picks. AirTran fell 1 cent to $7.59.
Citing improved liquidity, Standard & Poor's took AirTran's credit rating off its CreditWatch list and assigned the debt 
a "stable" outlook at "B-."
Reflecting concern over Ryanair's disclosure that it faces profit margin pressure and weaker revenue, shares traded 
down as much as 15 percent in London action.
In New York, shares of discount specialist Southwest Airlines  fell 3 cents to $16.14.

(6.53 am)
     Shares in Cobham are expected to fall under pressure in opening deals as CSFB adopted a more cautious 
stance, largely on valuation grounds.
    The broker cut the UK aerospace group to 'underperform' from the previous 'neutral', saying -- though Cobham 
remains a safe, high quality company with strong balance sheet and consistent delivery -- its quality is priced in at 
current levels.
    The broker, however, upped its target price for Cobham to 1150 pence from 1100p to reflect the steady progress 
the business continues to make.
    (7.45 am)
    Shares in Great Portland Estates edged lower in early trading as the property group revealed a swing to full-year 
losses from profits, an 11.2 pct reduction in its year-end adjusted diluted net asset value and warned that markets 
remain challenging after a year of rationalisation and refocus for the group.
    Following a strategic review, the group sold 216 mln stg of non-core properties, reduced gearing to 32 pct, made 
some solid progress on its development programme, maintained full occupancy within the portfolio and 
strengthened management.
    Great Portland shares were 1 adrift at 235 pence by 7.40 am.
    (7.51 am)
    Shares in CybIT went firmer in early trading, buoyed by the company's forecast of narrowing full-year losses and 
news that trading in the first two months of the current year is substantially ahead of the same period of the prior 
year.
    CybIT shares were 0.19 pence ahead at 0.77 by 7.50 am.
 (8.00 am)
    Shares in Ryanair, the Dublin-based no frills airline, were indicated lower in nervous pre-market trade as its 
cautiously optimistic trading outlook failed to calm nerves about the medium-term outlook for the airline.
    The airline's comments came as it reported in-line figures for the year to March.
LSE opening reports summary
    HSBC Securities, however, remains a fan of the discount airline, continuing to rate the stock a 'buy' at current 
levels.
    At 7.55 am, Ryanair shares were indicated 16 pence lower at 423-1/2 pence.
    (8.00 am)
    Shares in Redbus Interhouse moved up 0.50 pence to 4.87 as Cliff Stanford mounted a second attempt to oust 
the board of the data warehousing company he helped found.
    Stanford, who holds just under 30 pct of Redbus, has asked for an extraordinary meeting to vote on the 
replacement of all the directors by himself and two colleagues - Tony Simkin and Roy Bliss. The move comes less 
than a year after he was defeated in a similar battle for control.
    (8.00 am)
    Shares in JKX Oil and Gas moved up 3/4 pence to 1.05 after the group revealed that test results from well M202 
have exceeded the company's hopes.
    (8.13 am)
    Shares in Landround made solid progress among small-cap issues after the AIM-listed travel promotional 
products group revealed bumper half-yearly numbers, with pretax profits surging nearly 250 pct.
    Sentiment in the stock was also given a boost by news that Statoil, the market leader in fuel and forecourt 
retailing in Ireland, has agreed to offer it Premium Club members the opportunity to acquire buy and fly! points.
    Landround shares were 17-1/2 pence higher at 220 by 8.06 am - a near 9 pct gain.
    (8.17 am)
    Shares in Aortech International topped the list of worst-performing small-cap issues after the company revealed 
widening full-year losses and said it intends to seek permission at the AGM for a capital reconstruction.
    The company, who's CEO Bill Stachan is to step down, added that following a strategic review, the board has 
decided that the silicone/polyurethane material Elast-Eon will form the basis of the new Aortech business.
    Aortech shares were 4.5 pence adrift at 9.50 by 8.14 am - a 32.14 pct decline.
    (8.19 am)
    Shares in UK blue chip fund manager Schroders headed the FTSE 100 index fallers board as investors 
registered their dismay at its cautious comments on the outlook for fund flows for the year.
    "Whilst net new business flows were marginally positive in the first four months, we remain cautious about fund 
flows for the year as a whole," Schroders said.
    Followers had been hoping that, with equity markets rising to levels not seen for months, Schroders would be 
optimistic on the full year trading outlook.
    Some pundits were also disappointed by news that funds under management at Schroders fell 2.3 pct in the 
three months to March 31 to 84.2 bln stg.
    By 8.17 am, Schroders shares were down 23-1/4 pence at 662 pence.

while Carphone Warehouse edged up 1 to 84 after a 21.8 pct lift in annual profits.

- European markets headed lower on Tuesday amid a chip stock decline, a retreat in the overnight and an IBM 
accounting scandal.
The German DAX Xetra 30 index  fell 1.2 percent to 3,036 while the French CAC 40 index  dropped 0.8 percent to 
3,024.
London markets were also lower amid results from Barclays, BAA, Schroders, Ryanair and Carphone Warehouse . 
.
The euro eased to $1.1717 vs. the U.S. dollar. The G-8 meeting of the world's largest economies did not end up 
issuing a statement on currency movements.
The overnight saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreat from gains while European markets were open on 
Tuesday, finishing higher by 47 points. IBM also said it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission on its revenue recognition practices. .
On the economic front, French consumer confidence rose from -29 in April to -27 in May, the INSEE statistics 
agency. The April unemployment rate in the eurozone met consensus estimates at 8.8 percent, while the April PPI 
eased 0.4 percent, a tick more than the 0.3 percent consensus expectation.
Of stocks in the spotlight, French telecom equipment maker Alcatel  dropped 5.6 percent as it said that it will launch 
a 1 billion euro convertible deal, which will have a maximum dilution of 4.7 percent. The proceeds will be used 
primarily to the partial repurchase of three Alcatel bonds maturing in 2004 and 2005, the company said. The bonds 
will carry a fixed annual interest of 4.75 percent.
Microchip shares were lower in Europe following their run-up in previous sessions.
German memory chip maker Infineon Technologies  shares were off 4.4 percent, Franco-Italian chip producer 
STMicroelectronics  declined 3.1 percent, German chipmaker EPCOS  fell 3.5 percent and Dutch chip equipment 
maker ASML  was off 3.9 percent.
The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics said that the first quarter sales were below expectations and that 2002 
sales were below expectations, at $141 billion. The WSTS said chip industry should grow 11.5 percent during 2003 
to $156.9 billion worldwide, against prior estimates of 16.6 percent growth. Sensors, digital signal processors and 
flash EEPROMS should grow above 25 percent, it added.
Europe declines, Alcatel lower after convertible deal - UPDATE 2
Lagardere  eased 2.5 percent as the European Commission authorities have identified over 100 markets where 
purchase of Vivendi Universal's  book business is uncompetitive, the Financial Times said Tuesday, citing people 
close to the division. The concern is that Hachette, Lagardere's subsidiary, would have a dominant presence in the 
French publishing industry.
Vivendi shares eased 1.1 percent.
Insurer AXA  was upgraded by JPMorgan from underweight to overweight on the back of strong inflows in unit-
linked life and asset management units. The broker saw the stock should perform strongly as soon as investors are 
part considering first half 2003 results, which are due August 12. AXA shares were lower by 1.2 percent in Paris.
Franco-Spanish tobacco group Altadis  was lower by more than 6 percent on Tuesday, as Standard & Poor's 
revised its outlook to negative following Altadis' announcement of a debt-financed acquisition of 80 percent of 
Moroccan tobacco monopoly Rgie Nationale des Tabacs Marocains.
"The negative outlook reflects the fact that Altadis has exhausted its flexibility within its current rating," the ratings 
agency said, even as it said the deal should boost Altadis' profile.

Akzo Nobel  improved 1.1 percent in a declining Amsterdam stock market on Tuesday after announcing that it will 
cut up to 200 jobs in its surface chemistry division amid a restructuring. In North America, the reduction of up to 120 
people will be primarily in production, while in Europe, the changes will primarily occur in administration, R&D and 
sales, Akzo said.This story was supplied by CBSMarketWatch. For further information see

STMicroelectronics  declined 3.1 percent, German chipmaker EPCOS  fell 3.5 percent and Dutch chip equipment 
maker ASML  was off 3.9 percent.
The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics said that the first quarter sales were below expectations and that 2002 
sales were below expectations, at $141 billion. The WSTS said chip industry should grow 11.5 percent during 2003 
to $156.9 billion worldwide, against prior estimates of 16.6 percent growth. Sensors, digital signal processors and 
flash EEPROMS should grow above 25 percent, it added.
Europe declines, Alcatel lower after convertible deal - UPDATE 4
Lagardere  eased 2.5 percent as the European Commission authorities have identified over 100 markets where 
purchase of Vivendi Universal's  book business is uncompetitive, the Financial Times said Tuesday, citing people 
close to the division. The concern is that Hachette, Lagardere's subsidiary, would have a dominant presence in the 
French publishing industry.
Vivendi shares eased 1.1 percent.
Insurer AXA  was upgraded by JPMorgan from underweight to overweight on the back of strong inflows in unit-
linked life and asset management units. The broker saw the stock should perform strongly as soon as investors are 
part considering first half 2003 results, which are due August 12. AXA shares were lower by 1.2 percent in Paris.
Franco-Spanish tobacco group Altadis  was lower by more than 6 percent on Tuesday, as Standard & Poor's 
revised its outlook to negative following Altadis' announcement of a debt-financed acquisition of 80 percent of 
Moroccan tobacco monopoly Rgie Nationale des Tabacs Marocains.
"The negative outlook reflects the fact that Altadis has exhausted its flexibility within its current rating," the ratings 
agency said, even as it said the deal should boost Altadis' profile.
Akzo Nobel  improved 1.1 percent in a declining Amsterdam stock market on Tuesday after announcing that it will 
cut up to 200 jobs in its surface chemistry division amid a restructuring. In North America, the reduction of up to 120 
people will be primarily in production, while in Europe, the changes will primarily occur in administration, R&D and 
sales, Akzo said.

Shares in Ryanair, the Dublin-based no frills airline, were indicated lower in nervous pre-market trade as its 
cautiously optimistic trading outlook failed to calm nerves about the medium-term outlook for the airline.
 The airline's comments came as it reported in-line figures for the year to March.
    HSBC Securities, however, remains a fan of the discount airline, continuing to rate the stock a 'buy' at current 
levels.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it will offer tickets for free for all seats on its flights between Finland and Sweden until 
June 20, with passengers only having to pay airport taxes.
    The news came after troubled Finnish flag carrier Finnair reported yesterday its largest quarterly loss in five years 
and said the coming quarters will also remain weak.
 "Our main competitor in this market is clearly Finnair," said sales and marketing manager Sinead Finn at a news 
conference in Helsinki.
    "As we will open new routes to Finland the customers will have a choice between Finnair and Ryanair, and we 
are much cheaper," she said.
    In the beginning of April Ryanair opened its first route to Finland, from Stockholm to Tampere.
    During April there were over 9,000 passengers on this route, and in May the target is set at 12,000 passengers, it 
said.
    Finn said Ryanair is currently in talks with 10 possible new bases and also with about 50 new airports to open 
new routes to, but the decisions are expected at earliest in September.
    She did not want to specify the possible destinations, but said that some of the airports and possible bases are in 
the Nordic region.

The European Commission's investigation into Charleroi airport, which is accused of giving subsidies to Ryanair 
PLC, has prompted complaints from other airports, said a spokesman.
    "We received complaints relating to other European airports," he said, but declined to identify the plaintiffs or the 
airports concerned.
 He added that it is "not very probable" that another investigation will be launched before the conclusion of the 
Charleroi inquiry.
    The commission launched a probe on Dec 11 into reductions in landing taxes and a guarantee that the costs of 
maintaining a hub in Charleroi would be fixed for the period of the 15 year contract with Ryanair.
    Commission officials said the probe was launched because of concerns that these benefits were not offered to 
other airlines and were therefore anti-competitive.

ROUNDUP easyJet cautious on outlook as reports hefty H1 loss
ROUNDUP easyJet cautious on outlook as reports hefty H1 loss

easyJet PLC, the Luton based low-cost airline whose shares fell to an all-time low last week, has slumped to a 48.1 
mln stg first half loss and cautioned that with yields under pressure visibility on the full year outcome is months 
away.
    But despite the disappointment chief executive Ray Webster remained upbeat, describing the 374 mln stg 
acquisition of rival Go-Fly, the abortive move to purchase British Airways PLC's Deutsche BA and the decision to 
buy Airbus A319 aircraft as "fundamental strategic projects that were fully justified."
    He told AFX News: "I'm very confident that we're very well positioned and you'll see bottom line performance 
coming through to reflect that over the next two or three years."
    easyJet, which operates 105 routes between 38 destinations and 11 countries, traditionally reports a small first 
half loss. However, losses this year were exacerbated by the later timing of Easter, weakness in fares in the build-
up to and onset of military conflict in Iraq and the slowing of European economies.
    For the six months to March 31 2003, easyJet reported a loss before goodwill, non-recurring items and tax of 
24.4 mln stg versus a reported profit of 0.8 mln stg last time.
    However, after taking account of goodwill of 8.9 mln stg, non-recurring expenses relating to the integration of Go-
Fly of 5.6 mln stg and costs associated with the option (not taken up) to purchase Deutsche BA of 9.2 mln stg, the 
reported pretax loss was 48.1 mln stg -- a figure at the bottom end of sector analysts' forecasts of a pretax loss of 
49-35.1 mln stg.
 The hefty first half loss was notched-up despite record revenues of 373 mln stg for the first half, up 92 pct and 
reflecting last August's purchase of Go-Fly.
    On a proforma basis, assuming a combined easyJet and Go-Fly in 2002, the underlying revenue increase was 25 
pct.
    First half passenger numbers were up 40 pct to 9.3 mln and load factor --the number of passengers as a 
proportion of the number of seats available -- was up 1.1 points to 82.2 pct.
    However, the average fare (yield) was 37.45 stg, 10.7 pct lower than last year.
    Despite the shortfall Webster maintained easyJet's business model remains robust.
ROUNDUP easyJet cautious on outlook as reports hefty H1 loss
    "It is clear, as we move towards the busy summer period, that passengers are still willing to travel within Europe 
and they are responsive to price."
    He pointed out that April passenger traffic was up 34 pct with a load factor of 85.1 pct, while yields were down 3 
pct year-on-year. The month benefited from the Easter holiday and from pent-up demand following the hostilities in 
Iraq.
    Forward bookings indicate that revenue per flight in May is "tracking close to last year", whereas June "appears 
weaker", although a much lower proportion of June's seats have currently been booked.
    Webster cautioned: "At this point in time it is too early to have visibility regarding the financial outcome for the full 
year, as the strength of fares over our crucial summer period is not likely to be clear for a couple of months.
    "However, we expect to maintain high load factors, albeit with yields continuing to be under some pressure 
compared to last year, offset to an extent by the reduction in the rate of growth of capacity which occurs in the 
second half of the year."
    Webster also pointed out that the low-cost sector traditionally does better than other travel sectors in a recession 
and suggested the negative impact SARS is having on long-haul travel could act as a boost to short-haul European 
routes.
    He also noted that the integration of Go-Fly is proceeding ahead of plan.
    "The business of putting the two companies together is now behind us and the top team is now focusing on what 
are the next big ideas we can implement to take costs out of the business and enhance revenues," he said.
    One major initiative is to increase easyJet's share of the business market. The airline recently launched a 'Travel 
Manager' facility on its website which assists corporates in using the easyJet product.
    Costs will still be cut aggressively, easyJet confirming today that a further 50 jobs will be axed at its Luton head 
office. It is also moving to outsource the management of handling companies in Geneva and Luton.
    The chief executive explained that easyJet is "kick-starting" the market after the shock of the Iraq war with a 'tax 
free' fare promotion, effectively knocking 5 stg or 10 pct off fares.
    The airline is currently engaged in a war of words with low-cost rival Ryanair Holdings PLC.
    Ryanair has altered its strategy. After years of attacking national carrier British Airways PLC it is now aiming its 
guns at easyJet.
    A current Ryanair advertising campaign compares easyJet executives to Said al-Sahhaf, the self-styled Iraqi 
Information Minister, who became known as 'Comical Ali' during the war due to his outrageously optimistic 
pronouncements on the coalition forces.
    Last night Ryanair announced it will give away 1,000 'free seats' for every 1 mln eur easyJet lost in the first half.
    "Nothing surprises us about Ryanair," Webster said today.
    He dismissed Ryanair's campaign as a gimmick and said easyJet's own analysis suggested it is actually 
benefiting from the Ryanair onslaught.
    By 12.35 pm easyJet shares -- which have come off a 503-1/4 pence March 2002 high and hit a historic closing 
low of 173-1/2 pence last Friday -- had rallied 8-1/2 pence to 196-1/4.
    easyJet's lowly rating has fuelled vague rumours that the airline could be vulnerable to a takeover bid, perhaps 
from Southwest Airlines, the American pioneer of low-cost air travel.
    "I guess anything is possible," said Webster. "But I think anyone who's got shares will be looking for a lot of 
upside to come through in any transaction, so I suspect that may put the dampeners on it."
    Merrill Lynch said it is reviewing its current year to end-September 2003 operating profit forecast for easyJet of 
70.8 mln stg. Although the broker reiterated its 'neutral' recommendation, it sees the balance of risk as on the 
downside due to the likelihood of further yield erosion.
ROUNDUP easyJet cautious on outlook as reports hefty H1 loss
    Citigroup's Smith Barney is maintaining its 'outperform, high risk' rating with a target price of 316 pence.
    The broker expects flat average fares in the second half. It said its earnings forecast for the second half will be 
dependent on cost relief from lower fuel prices, the weak US dollar and a strong euro.
    "We continue to believe in easyJet's business model and that these disappointing results are mainly due to 
excessive capacity growth (now slowed down), immaturity of the Go-Fly network, and an unhedged fuel position."
    Meanwhile, Williams de Broe repeated its 'sell' stance

 From that date Buzz Stansted will commence 11 routes to France, Spain and Germany from London Stansted.
    Ryanair said demand for the routes has been "phenomenal" with over 130,000 passengers booked to fly them in 
May alone.

Share prices are expected to open flat to lower, as
trading after the long Easter holiday weekend should get off to a slow start, with the performance by Wall Street 
stocks yesterday providing few leads, dealers said.
    However, Infineon is set to be a weak feature, in light of the group's
wider-than-expected net loss and downbeat comments on the near-term prospects of
the chipmaking industry.
    At 8.17 am, Lang & Schwarz brokerage was indicating the DAX 30 index to open
at around 2,895, down some 4 points from Thursday's close at 2,899.78, which had
marked a gain of 75.10 points on the day.

Body
Ryanair PLC, the no-frills carrier, said it has completed the acquisition of Buzz and has paid 20.1 mln eur to KLM to 
acquire 10 aircraft, up to 130 employees, and some airport facilities.
    Ryanair confirmed the agreed price was reduced from 23.9 mln eur as a result of a number of issues which arose 
during the due diligence process.
    KLM UK will retain up to 470 of its Buzz staff, as well as its headquarters in Stansted, the assets and liabilities of 
the legal entity KLM UK Ltd which was trading as Buzz up to 31 March 2003.
    Ryanair said it has formed a new subsidiary called Buzz Stansted Ltd, which holds UK AOC approval, and will 
start flying on May 1.
    It is intended that the company will operate its aircraft on a subservice basis flying directly for Ryanair, primarily 
operating on a network of 12 routes, which were formerly operated by KLM UK/Buzz, Ryanair said.
    The new chief executive will be John Osborne -- former director of operations for Ryanair and former chief 
executive of GB Airways and Virgin Express.
    But Ryanair warned that the deal has not yet been given the green light by UK regulatory authorities -- though 
Ireland and Germany have given approval -- and said it has advised the UK Office of Fair Trading of its intention to 
complete the acquisition without waiting for regulatory approval in advance.
    "We will continue over the coming two weeks to liaise closely with both the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) and the 
OFT and look forward to obtaining their approval in due course of the purchase and rescue of the core operation of 
Buzz and its successful re-launch from 1 May onwards," Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said.

Leading shares were expected to open lower, with a flat overnight performance on Wall Street likely to put 
economic worries to the fore as traders await news of what many expect to be a downbeat UK Budget statement, 
dealers said.
    The FTSE 100 index was indicated to open lower by 19 points by spread-betting firm IG Index, which saw a 
starting range of 3,842 to 3,850.
    Overnight, the DJIA closed down 1.49 points at 8,298.92, S&P 500 off 1.64 at 878.29 and the Nasdaq composite 
was down 6.57 at 1,382.94.
    And in Asia, the Nikkei 225 index went into the afternoon session down 22.92 points at 8108.49, while the Hang 
Seng closed the morning session 169.11 points lower at 8,637.55.
    In the US, speeches from the Fed members Poole, Snow and Ferguson will be scrutinised for further clues on 
the the next move on US interest rates -- particularly in the wake of the recent slew of negative economic data.
    The UK's main focus, from a news if not a markets perspective, will be the budget speech due to start at 12.30 
pm.
    Most commentators expect little news from Chancellor Gordon Brown following his tax hikes last year.  IG Index 
is predicting a speech lasting just 55 to 58 minutes.
    Official UK GDP growth projections are expected to be cut, but most economists see a hike in borrowing 
requirements rather than by any significant tax rise.
    Any rise in stamp duty will turn the spotlight on property firms such as Canary Wharf and Slough Estates. 
Recent press reports have suggested Brown may look to introduce a new band for property worth more than 1 mln 
stg that will be taxed at up to 6 pct.
    This adds to worries voiced by the retail sector, which expects changes to the rules regarding the treatment of 
commercial leases.
    The British Retail Consortium is worried Brown's reforms will undermine the ability of new retailers to enter the 
market not only by pushing up the existing cost of Stamp Duty, but also by including new up-front payments.
    The abolition of stamp duty on share trades -- a long called-for measure -- is not expected.
London shares outlook - lower after flat Wall Street, awaiting Budget
    Airline stocks such as Easyjet and Ryanair could be affected by a rumoured rise in airport taxes, while Rank 
Group will be closely watched if Brown confirms a widely-expected new tax on bingo operators.
    Ahead of the Budget, the City has a light diary of corporate news to digest.
    Matalan, the rapidly expanding discount clothing and homewares retailer, is expected to report later today an 
annual profit of 115-120 mln stg, up from 107.6 mln stg last time.
    Surprises are not expected as Matalan said on March 18 it was comfortable with this range.
    However, any outlook guidance will be scrutinised as Matalan tries to reassure investors after it sacked Paul 
Mason as its chief executive after just 14 months in the job following a falling-out with founding chairman John 
Hargreaves.
    The airline sector will take its latest health check with March passenger figures from BAA, Britain's largest 
airports operator.
    News overnight from Qantas Airways could also dampen sentiment in stocks such as BA.  Australia's national 
carrier said forward bookings for the UK were down 10 pct, with Hong Kong down 25 pct, Europe down 15-17 pct, 
and Japan down 20 pct.
    But Qantas said it does not plan to revise down its recent profit guidance for the year to June 2003, despite the 
ongoing impact of SARS and the Iraq war on passenger volumes.
    Elsewhere, insurance stocks could see some pressure amid growing speculation that Munich Re will launch a 3 
bln eur subordinated bond as early as today. The reinsurer was known to be planning a bond issue soon, but has 
said nothing about the volume, exact timing and conditions.
    Oil shares could match a rising Crude price on expectations that OPEC will make a production cut to avert a 
potential price collapse in the second quarter.  The cartel is reportedly considering an emergency ministerial 
meeting on April 24.
    Further down the market, full-year results from Austin Reed were keenly awaited.  The clothes retailer has 
recently been the subject of bid interest, with Glasgow-based private firm Slater Menswear said to be a suitor.

UK smaller company shares closed lower, mirroring the broader market, as concerns over the global economy and 
the war in Iraq led to profit taking after yesterday's sharp gains, dealers said.
    At the close, the FTSE Small Cap index was down 5.9 points at 1,690.3, ending in the middle of the day's tight 
trading range, while the FTSE 100 index was down 67.0 points at 3868.8.
    In corporate news, Bespak slid 35 pence to 247-1/2 after it said it continues to experience weakness in valve 
sales and flagged second-half results at break-even at best in the second half. News of bid interest for the medical 
devices firm failed to provide support.
    News that UBS Warburg downgraded Aberdeen Asset Management to 'neutral' sent the fund manager's shares 
down 3 pence at 36. Its move followed Aberdeen being dismissed as manager to Real Estate Opportunities 
Investment Trust.
    Beleagured travel company MyTravel was weak, falling 0.91 pence to 11.25 amid economic concerns and fears 
that the SARS virus will further depress global travel.
    On the upside, Tertiary Minerals gained 1.25 pence to 9.50, encouraged by an upbeat drilling report.
    The mining group said a scoping study of its Ghurayyah tantalum-niobium project in Saudi Arabia has produced 
positive results which recommend further feasibility studies and suggest development starting in 2006 when growth 
in the market for tantalum is expected to have resumed.
    The company added that it is investigating various sources of non-equity funding to progress the recommended 
work programme.
 Severfield-Rowen was another firm issue, adding 22-1/2 pence to 230 after posting pleasing full-year figures and 
issuing an upbeat outlook.
    The company said all core businesses performed profitably in 2002, with its Watson Steel unit modestly 
performing ahead of expectations in the period.
    Chairman Peter Levine also announced that the company has been awarded the main steelwork contract for the 
new Terminal 5 at Heathrow.
    Ryanair Holdings added 14-1/2 pence to 455-1/2 after the airline issued upbeat customer service statistics for 
March, noting that 91 pct of its flights arrived on time in the month.
UK small caps end lower on profit taking amid war, economic concerns
    Elsewhere Kewill Systems gained 2-1/4 pence to 31 after saying revenues in the second half are expected to be 
in line with management's expectations and will show growth on the first half in both its US and European 
businesses.
    In a statement, the company said operating loss for the second half is also expected to be in line with its 
expectations, adding that it does not anticipate further exceptional costs.
    The software minnow was one of a number of small cap technology stocks on the move, with the sector lifted by 
hopes of an upturn in the market.
    Baltimore added 1-1/2 pence to 21-1/2, Emblaze climbed 3 pence to 93, NetBenefit gained 5 pence to 24-3/4 and 
CybIT moved 0.04 pence higher to 0.32.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has started operating from its 9th base in Europe, Stockholm-Skavsta, 100 kilometres 
from the Swedish capital and near Nykoping.
    It will offer 30 daily flights on six new international routes, to Aarhus in Denmark, Oslo in Norway, Tampere in 
Finland, Glasgow in Scotland, Hamburg and Frankfurt in Germany and to Paris.
 Chief Executive Michael Cawley said: "This is Ryanair's most successful base. We are carrying over 100,000 
passengers in the first month on the new routes and will carry over 1.5 million passengers in the first year."
    "Our arrival here, and the increase in tourists, will create over 1,000 jobs in the region," he said.
    Ryanair added it has allocated up to 4 of its new Boeing 737-800 jets to the new base.

UK airlines said they have cancelled services to and from France as a result of planned strike action by French air 
traffic controllers.
    The French air traffic controllers are striking between 5.00 am and 9.00 pm today as part of a broad based action 
amongst public sector workers over the pensions provision.
 British Airways PLC said it is likely that up to 80 pct of its services -- some 95 out of 120 individual flights -- will be 
cancelled during the period of the strike.
    easyJet PLC, the Luton-based no frills airline, said it has cancelled some 40 flights.
    Ryanair Holdings PLC said all its flights to and from France scheduled for today have been cancelled.
    BA and easyJet added that due to planned industrial action in Greece on April 2 and 3 a number of flights have 
been cancelled.

The Italian antitrust authority, which also deals with unfair advertising, said it is fining Ryanair Ltd 2,582 eur over its 
internet advertising for London/Turin flights and has ordered the company to stop the advert in question within three 
months.
    The authority investigated a complaint from a consumer that Ryanair's web site offering of a 20 eur ticket on the 
route failed to include costs for airport tax and other items, it said.
 "The cheapest tariff - equal or below that publicised - does not represent the overall price of the ticket but only a 
part, to which the consumer is going to have to add further costs," said the authority.
    "In particular, according to information supplied by the operator, such costs involve airport taxes, government 
taxes and security costs," it said.
    "Overall, this can affect the price in a noticeable way, up to 13 eur on a ticket for 20 eur or less," it said.
    In addition there is a 5 eur sum for those buying their ticket via a credit card, it said.
    Under Italian law and court precedents, tariff conditions must be clearly and immediately intelligible to consumers 
and include all components of the final price, said the authority.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is pulling out of its proposed new route from London Stansted to Grenoble in the

    "This route had been taken on as a result of negotiations with the airport after the announcement of Ryanair's 
acquisition of Buzz but recent contractual difficulties have led to Ryanair being unable to conclude an acceptable

Ryanair Holdings PLC said its acquisition of Buzz from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV will not be completed

    The Irish low-cost airline said it has been in regular correspondence with the OFT and is seeking urgent approval 
"in order to save the core operation of Buzz and preserve up to 130 jobs at a time of crisis in the aviation industry".
    Ryanair and KLM said they do not envisage any difficulties in obtaining the necessary clearance in due course.

Ryanair will offer a million flights for 9.99 eur to fight a slump in traffic stemming from the war in Iraq, the low-cost 
Irish airline's president said.
    It will also maintain plans to buy around 250 Boeing 737-800 jets in the coming eight years and O'Leary said "we 
are going to keep the (airline's) schedule to all destinations."
 Customers will be sold tickets to all of the carrier's destinations for 9.99 eur for between one and two months, 
Michael O'Leary added.
    The offer "is the correct response to the reductions registered" by airlines worldwide, he said.
    "We will not follow the recommendations by IATA (International Air Transport Association) to increase prices by 
three percent starting April 15," O'Leary said.
    "On the contrary, what we have to do is to reduce them to attract people. We have to fill the seats to lose less 
money."
    Ryanair will offer direct service between Reims and London starting April 30.
    The low-cost carrier was less affected by the drop in global air traffic than long-haul companies, he 
acknowledged.

Body
Several aspects of Ryanair Holdings PLC advertising, including the exclusion of taxes in its advertised prices, in 
Finland, are questioned by local consumer ombudsman.
    "We have this legislation in Finland that requires the total price to be given in consumer marketing," Marianne 
Kajander, a legal advisor for the consumer ombudsman's office said earlier.
 Ryanair now has until April 4 to answer and remedy the consumer ombudsman's complaints, when the first plane 
is expected to take off from Finland's second largest city of Tampere.
    Ryanair starts flying next week between Tampere and Sweden's Skavsta, which has been marketed by Ryanair 
as "Stockholm" despite it is located 100 kilometers outside the Swedish capital. According to the consumer 
watchdog, Ryanair is misleading its Finnish customers by not stating the right destination in its marketing material.
    The government agency is also unhappy about the fact that Ryanair has not provided a cost-free channel where 
its Finnish customers can put forward complaints in their own language, instead they have to call a fee-charging 
Swedish-speaking helpdesk in neighbouring Sweden.
    Earlier this month, Ryanair was indicted by Danish police for publishing misleading price information after failing 
to respond to complaints from Danish consumer authorities.

There is currently a large exodus of SAS AB pilots to Ryanair Holding PLC and other airlines, daily Berlingske 
Tidende reported, citing Paul Fitzsimmons, Ryanair's communications director.
    Ryanair is experiencing much interest from pilots currently flying for SAS, Fitzsimmons said.
 Half of the job interviews in recent weeks have been with pilots from SAS. The same is true for applications that 
have yet to be processed, he added.
    There are 10-20 interviews a week, the daily reported.
    Today there are 24 ex-SAS pilots flying for Ryanair, Fitzsimmons added.
    Because of cost cutbacks, SAS has reduced capacity, mothballed aircraft, fired 300 pilots and still has a surfeit of 
pilots, the newspaper added.
    Younger pilots, many of them paying a loan covering a 600,000 dkr bill for training, are facing an uncertain future 
due to new cutbacks, it said.
    Ryanair pilots fly more hours than SAS pilots but get better pay, the daily added, citing Mogens Holgard, 
chairman of the Danish pilots' association.
    Other airlines are also receiving applications from SAS pilots, it added.

(Updating with full report)
     Share prices closed lower, with Tandberg tumbling after a reduced sales forecast for the first quarter and a 
subsequent Deutsche Bank downgrade, brokers said.
    The OSEBX Benchmark index closed 2.66 points lower at 105.23.
    For technical reasons, no updated turnover figure has been available since 3.35 pm, when turnover was 1.15 bln 
nkr.
    The OSEAX All Share index closed 2.39 points lower at 111.04.
    Tandberg closed 15.6 nkr lower at 19.2 after the company issued a first quarter sales forecast of 340-360 mln 
nkr, down from 407.1 mln the year earlier, and almost 100 mln lower than analysts' consensus of 430 mln, and 
following a downgrade by Deutsche Bank. This led to brokers predicting a share price of 18-20 nkr today.
    The profit warning issued late Friday has caused Deutsche Bank to cut its estimates and downgrade the stock 
from 'hold' to 'sell', with a new 27 nkr downside target.
    "Although we had expected a challenging first quarter, the warning was a very negative surprise," Deutsche Bank 
said in a research note.
    Deutsche Bank said a combination of continuous negative earnings revisions, potential loss of market shares and 
an uncertain outlook will take the share lower despite possible support from the share buy back and dividend 
payment.
    UBS Warburg subsequently cut its target price to 26 nkr from 57 nkr.
    Tandberg is due to post its first quarter earnings figures on April 10.
    Tomra Systems was pulled 2.8 down to 30 by the negative sentiment from Tandberg and Wall Street's opening 
falls, brokers said.
 Aker Kvaerner closed 0.21 lower at 3.27. It was lifted off its low by a 1.75 bln nkr contract from ConocoPhillips' 
Norwegian unit to build the new Ekofisk 2/4-M platform. Its Aker Marine Contractors unit also won an 80 mln nkr 
contract to install subsea production systems on Statoil's Snoehvit field in the Barents Sea.
    Frontline fell 1.5 to 73.5, pulled down by a further fall in charter rates for oil tankers, brokers said.
    Statoil closed 1 lower at 55 and Norsk Hydro shed 1 to 278.5.
Oslo shares close lower; Tandberg tumbles after forecast cut UPDATE
    SAS was 0.8 lower at 28.2 after Berlingske Tidende reported a large exodus of SAS AB pilots to Ryanair Holding 
PLC and other airlines. Danish daily Boersen added that the airline fears additional state guarantees to competitors.
    Schibsted added 1 to 72. Switzerland's 20 Min Holding, in which Schibsted holds a 41 pct stake, has reached an 
agreement for sale of the operations to the Express Zeitung AG. The initial sale of the 49.5 pct is not expected to 
have any accounting effects for Schibsted.
    Orkla fell 1 to 109.5 and Norske Skog shed 1.5 to 95.

    Healthcare stocks also tracked Wall Street, brokers said, with Novo Nordisk B falling 3 to 232 and Chr Hansen

    Lundbeck was 1.5 lower at 140.5 after UBS Warburg cut its stance to 'reduce' from 'neutral' on valuation grounds

    Novozymes B was 4.5 higher at 151 on reports that it is seeing increasing sales to the bakery sector.
    Radiometer B was 4.5 higher at 324.5, clawing back some of its recent fall.
    The AP Moeller group's stocks DS 1912 B added 1,100 to 49,400 and DS Svendborg B closed 1,400 higher at 
72,700 as oil prices pushed higher after setbacks in the Iraq conflict over the weekend prompted renewed fears of 
disruption to the country's exports, analysts said.
 The AP Moeller group is expected on Thursday to post full year 2002 net profit of about 12 bln dkr.
    This is in line with the company's raised forecast from Feb 24, when it said it expects net profit, excluding 
financials, at its DS Svendborg and DS 1912 operating units of 10.5 bln dkr, plus a further 1.5 bln dkr in financial 
earnings, analysts said.
    There will be some focus on the group's Maersk Sealand container line and analysts are also hoping for further 
information about the amalgamation of the two shares as well as news of a share split to increase liquidity.
    DSV B fell 2 to 141.5. Analysts polled by RB-Boersen expect it to post full year pretax profit of 541 mln dkr on

Ryanair to relaunch 13 of Buzz's 24 routes as 90 pct of pilots agree contracts
Ryanair to relaunch 13 of Buzz's 24 routes as 90 pct of pilots agree contracts

Body
Ryanair Holdings PLC said the core of Buzz's loss-making operation has been saved after 90 pct of the company's 
pilots accepted new contracts enabling the group to relaunch 13 of Buzz's 24 routes from May 1.
    Ryanair said it expects that the rescued Buzz operation will operate 8 aircraft, with a total of over 170 people, and 
will carry almost 3 million passengers at an average fare of 43 eur over the first 12 months.
    The routes to be relaunched are between the UK and Dusseldorf (Niederrhein), Berlin, Frankfurt (Hahn), 
Bergerac, Brest, Grenoble, Toulouse (Carcassonne), Tours, La Rochelle, Limoges, Poitiers, Jerez and Murcia.
    Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said "These announcements today effectively complete the turnaround and 
reorganisation of the loss making Buzz operation. The disposal by KLM UK is due to be completed on 1 April next, 
and we remain hopeful that the various regulatory authorities will grant their approval on or before that date so that 
the core operation and over 170 jobs can be saved."
    He said Buzz is currently losing over 1 mln eur a week and KLM hasconfirmed its intention to close it down if the 
sale to Ryanair does not proceed.
    "We are therefore delighted that the overwhelming majority of the people who have been offered new contracts, 
at significantly increased remuneration, have decided to come on board and join Europe's No.1 low fares airline," 
O'Leary added.
    He also said Ryanair's own traffic continues to expand rapidly with the new base launched in Milan Bergamo on 
February 2 "enjoying record load factors", and the advance bookings on the ten routes to/from the new Stockholm 
Skavsta base "pouring in".
 Ryanair also announced a sale of 1 million one-way seats for 10 stg across all of its 59 (non Buzz) routes to and 
from London.

Body
Ryanair Holdings PLC has been indicted by police in Aarhus, Denmark's second city, for publishing misleading 
price information, reacting to a complaint from the government's consumer agency, police said.
    Ryanair is being accused of having published airfares in newspaper advertisements in 2002 without mentioning 
taxes and fees, as required by Danish law, thereby making prices seem lower than they really were.
 This caused an outcry from Ryanair's competitors, leading to the legal moves against the airline.
    "Ryanair ignored our call to respect the law for two years, refusing to respect the rules about the publication of 
prices," said Bent Bagge, division head at the consumer agency.
    Ryanair is also being accused of charging passenger an "airport tax" of 66 dkr, but passing only half that amount 
on to the airport authority and keeping the other half.

ROUNDUP Ryanair to cut 400 Buzz jobs, ground Buzz fleet for a month
ROUNDUP Ryanair to cut 400 Buzz jobs, ground Buzz fleet for a month

Body
Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Irish low-cost airline, is to axe up to 400 Buzz jobs in a radical restructuring of the loss-
making rival it purchased from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV for 5 mln eur earlier this month.
    The redundancies, which provoked a furious reaction from trade unions, will include Buzz head office and sales 
and administration staff, some 25 pct of pilots, up to 80 pct of cabin crew, all cargo staff, and around 50 pct of 
Buzz's ground operations staff at Stansted airport.
    The magnitude of the job losses shocked observers, given that Ryanair had indicated around 100 positions 
would be lost when it announced the Buzz deal on Feb 4.
    For the 200 Buzz staff retained Ryanair pledged increased pay and productivity allowances.
    The restructuring will see all Buzz flights grounded for the month of April "at least" and 12 Buzz routes terminated 
on March 31.
    Routes axed include Paris Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam Schipol, Marseilles and Toulon.
    The group will use the grounded period to effect the redundancies, re-brand the Buzz aircraft and airport facilities 
in Ryanair livery, provide refunds for passengers on terminated flights, and retrain all Buzz personnel and agents in 
Ryanair policies and procedures.
    The remaining 12 Buzz routes, the most popular, will continue from May 1 with increased frequencies. These 
routes include Frankfurt Hahn, Bordeaux and Toulouse (Carcassonne).
    The Buzz fleet will be reduced from 12 to eight aircraft -- six Boeing 737's and two BAe146's.
 Ryanair said fares on all continuing Buzz routes will be 50 pct lower than current Buzz fares, with double the seat 
capacity.
    Passengers will be able to re-book for new tickets from March 12 on existing or alternative destinations.
    "These plans will be presented to the creditors and staff of Buzz over the coming days, after which a final 
decision will be taken on whether to restart flying as planned on May 1 2003, or close Buzz altogether," Ryanair 
said.
    It said Buzz management will be briefing all staff this week that if agreement is not forthcoming within two weeks 
from the remaining 200 staff who will be offered continued employment, then Buzz will be closed on April 1.
ROUNDUP Ryanair to cut 400 Buzz jobs, ground Buzz fleet for a month
    In these circumstances Ryanair would take over the operation and flying of these routes from May 1.
    The restructuring is subject to the proposed sale of Buzz by KLM proceeding as planned on April 1. The deal 
remains subject to regulatory approvals.
    Ryanair claimed Buzz is currently losing over 1 mln eur per week.
    "These losses cannot be sustained," it warned.
    Trade unions reacted with anger to Ryanair's announcement.
    The Transport and General Workers' Union, which represents over 150 cabin crew at Buzz, demanded an urgent 
meeting with Ryanair over the proposed redundancies.
    "The union strongly believes that the proposal...is flawed as it falls short of legal requirements on consultation," it 
said.
    "Ryanair is pulling the Buzz strings but the T&G are no puppets. We will make sure we stand up for the rights of 
our members," said Tim Lyle, T&G national secretary for civil aviation.
    Pilots union BALPA also questioned the legality of Ryanair's plans.
    "We are angered by Ryanair's proposals. The merger with Buzz is being approached as if it were a fire sale. 
Buzz employees are not damaged goods," said general secretary Jim MacAuslan.
    "This is not the sort of employment practice that we expect to see in the UK. We are taking legal advice and will 
press the government to come clean on where it stands on this issue. We will also be raising our concerns with the 
regulator."
    Ryanair shares closed down 4-1/2 pence at 419.

Ryanair to cut 400 Buzz jobs, ground Buzz fleet for a month UPDATE
    The restructuring is subject to the proposed sale of Buzz by KLM proceeding as planned on April 1. The deal 
remains subject to regulatory approvals.
    Ryanair claimed Buzz is currently losing over 1 mln eur per week.
    "These losses cannot be sustained," it warned.
    Trade unions reacted with fury to Ryanair's announcement.
    The Transport and General Workers' Union, which represents over 150 cabin crew at Buzz, demanded an urgent 
meeting with Ryanair over the proposed redundancies.
    "The union strongly believes that the proposal...is flawed as it falls short of legal requirements on consultation," it 
said in a statement.
    "Ryanair is pulling the Buzz strings but the T&G are no puppets. We will make sure we stand up for the rights of 
our members," said Tim Lyle, T&G national secretary for civil aviation.
    At 12.42 pm shares in Ryanair were down 4-1/2 pence at 419.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Irish low-cost airline, is to axe 400 Buzz jobs in a radical restructuring of the loss-making 
rival it purchased from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV for 5 mln eur earlier this month.
    The restructuring will see all Buzz flights grounded for the month of April "at least" and 12 Buzz routes terminated 
on March 31.
 The remaining 12 Buzz routes will continue from May 1 with increased frequencies.
    The Buzz fleet will be reduced from 12 to eight aircraft -- six Boeing 737's and two BAe146's.
    Ryanair said fares on all continuing Buzz routes will be 50 pct lower, with double the seat capacity.
    It said there will also be increased pay and productivity allowances for the 200 Buzz staff retained.

ROUNDUP easyJet shares slump 15 pct on fares warning
ROUNDUP easyJet shares slump 15 pct on fares warning

Shares in easyJet PLC were over 15 pct lower in afternoon trading after the Luton-based no frills airline warned 
average fares have declined in excess of market expectations over the last four months.
    By 2.37 pm easyJet shares had been marked down 36-1/2 pence at 205-1/2 as sector analysts reacted to the 
news by cutting profit forecasts.
    Their shock at the fares shortfall was tinged with annoyance as easyJet's trading update was buried on page five 
of its circular notice regarding its planned purchase of 120 Airbus A319 aircraft and the convening of an EGM for 
March 12 to seek shareholder approval.
    easyJet said forward volumes for flights over the spring and summer periods are "encouraging".
    However, it revealed that over the four months to Jan 31 2003 its average fare has been approximately 6 pct 
lower than the average fare generated by the proforma combined easyJet and Go Fly networks during the same 
period last year.
    Sector analysts had anticipated a fall of around 4 pct.
    easyJet attributed the yield decline to year-on-year growth in aircraft seat capacity, the sale of additional seats at 
lower fares to lift the load factor of the Go Fly network closer to the easyJet network level and "market and 
economic forces".
    It warned the decrease in average fares for the half year to March 31 2003 may now be more in line with the 8 
pct reduction in year-on-year yields recently announced by Ryanair Holdings PLC.
 The airline also cautioned that although current forward bookings are robust, the overall profile of the last quarter's 
revenue, and hence the full year to end-Sept 2003 outcome, will not become apparent for "at least several months".
    The current financial year will also be impacted by the cost, as previously announced, of the integration of the Go 
Fly operation, the costs in connection with the option over Deutsche BA and the amortisation of goodwill -- 
estimated to amount to approximately 18 mln stg in the first half.
    The extent of the fares reduction surprised investors.
    "easyJet has flagged on several occasions (including at its AGM on Feb 14) that fares were weak, but this is the 
first time a number has been placed on it, and it is worse than we had expected," said Schroder Salomon Smith 
Barney in a note to clients.
ROUNDUP easyJet shares slump 15 pct on fares warning
    The broker estimates the potential revenue shortfall at around 20 mln stg in the half year, which if taken all the 
way to net income (less tax) would equate to a 14 mln stg shortfall or 3.5 pence per share -- some 15 pct of its 
current pre-amortisation fully-diluted EPS of 23.1 pence to Sept 2003.
    SSSB said it will review its forecasts, but still rates the stock 'outperform, high risk'.
    Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said it plans to cut its year to Sept 2003 pretax profit forecast of 130 mln stg 
going in to today by at least 10 pct. It still rates the stock a 'buy'.
    Cheuvreux repeated its 'outperform' recommendation, but said it expects the final two months of easyJet's first 
half to see even greater yield pressure than the first four months, as bookings are delayed with war risk in the 
Middle East.
    The French broker contrasted easyJet's "very poor" earnings visibility to Ryanair, which has guided full year 
numbers up by 50 pct over the last 18 months.
    It also pointed out that easyJet's comments today are somewhat at odds with its statement just 18 days ago that 
"trading has been brisk" in January.
    Meanwhile, easyJet reiterated that the integration of Go Fly, acquired for 374 mln stg last August, has proceeded 
"much faster" than originally planned with operations running well and pricing and sales now being conducted from 
unified systems.
    easyJet also hinted it will decide not to exercise its option to acquire British Airway's PLC's loss-making German 
subsidiary Deutsche BA (DBA) due to negotiating difficulties with the pilots.
    The airline can exercise the option, acquired last August, at any time up to April 30 this year, extendable to 
August 3.
    "The rationale for the option to acquire DBA remains valid, but easyJet has to be certain that its business model 
can be fully applied before deciding whether to exercise the option," it said.
    easyJet added that the list price for the 120 Airbus 319 aircraft on order is 5.3 bln usd. But it pointed out it has 
been granted "very substantial" price concessions by Airbus and CFM International, the selected engine 
manufacturer.
    Airbus is owned by European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co and BAE Systems PLC. CFM is a joint venture 
between General Electric and Snecma of France, and International Aero Engines.

 Fares will start from 29.99 stg one-way including tax -- a saving of 66 pct on the next cheapest direct fare, 
according to Ryanair.
    The airline expects 70,000 passengers to travel the route in the service's first year.
    The new service will necessitate the recruitment of up to 10 new pilots and 15 new cabin crew.

Macquarie Airports (MAp) said January passenger traffic numbers at all its airports showed improvement on the 
year earlier, with European properties boosted by new low cost carriers.
    MAp said traffic at Birmingham rose 26.3 pct in January from a year earlier, while traffic at Bristol was up 31.7 pct 
and Sydney was up 5.7 pct.
 In Rome Fiumicino rose 10.7 pct, while Ciampino was up 250 pct.
    "The figures for January continue to show the positive impact of the introduction of the low cost carriers to our 
portfolio of European airports."
    "These results were particularly strong in Ciampino where Air Berlin and
Ryanair have recently begun or expanded operations," it said.
    MAp has also confirmed that Aeroporti di Roma SpA (AdR) has successfully completed the refinancing of its 
existing bank debt facilities on improved terms.
    The 1.840 bln euro new debt facilities consist of 1.265 bln euro of credit wrapped and unwrapped bonds and 
0.575 bln of bank debt and replace the previous 1.725 bln euro bank facilities.
    The refinancing satisfies the condition precedent announced by MAp in December 2002 regarding the AdR 
acquisition by Macquarie Airports (Luxembourg) SA (MALSA).
    "The acquisition of a 44.74 pct shareholding in AdR by MALSA is currently
anticipated to reach financial close before 31 March 2003," it said.

Ryanair to provide proof this week benefits from Charleroi are not state aid
Ryanair to provide proof this week benefits from Charleroi are not state aid

Body
Ryanair Holdings PLC chief executive Michael O'Leary said he will provide evidence this week to the European 
Commission to prove benefits offered to the company by Charleroi airport do not constitute illegal state aid.
    The commission launched a probe on Dec 11 into reductions in landing taxes and a guarantee that the costs of 
maintaining a hub in Charleroi would be fixed for the period of the 15 year contract with Ryanair.
    Commission officials said the probe was launched because of concerns that these benefits were not offered to 
other airlines and were therefore anti-competitive.
    Speaking to reporters here, O'Leary said he is "very confident" the commission will clear the benefits under EU 
state aid rules offered by Charleroi airport and the Wallonian government.
    He said the company will provide documentary evidence that at the time when it selected Brussels Charleroi in 
February 2001, it had four other proposals from other European airports including private ones.
    He said some of these offers were from private airports, and some were slightly cheaper than the Charleroi base 
and some slightly more expensive.
    "This clearly demonstrates that Brussels Charleroi and the Wallonian government were acting in compliance with 
the market investor principle which takes it out of the state aid category in that they are simply doing what other 
privately owned airports were doing," said O'Leary.
    Under state aid rules, this type of financial assistance would be permitted if the terms are the same as those 
offered by private operators.
 Concerning whether other airlines were offered similar deals, he said: "The deal was never exclusive to Ryanair. 
We will be providing the commission with evidence of similar offers they (Charleroi and the Wallonian government) 
made to other airlines including Sabena, Virgin Express, Easyjet and Buzz."
    "The fact it wasn't exclusive to Ryanair, it wasn't some private deal and was offered to other airlines takes it out 
of the area of state aid," he said.

Ryanair Holdings PLC has cut its daily service from Shannon to Frankfurt to just once a week after the Aer Rianta 
airport at Shannon refused to withdraw its proposed 6 eur per passenger cost increase on the route. Instead, 
Ryanair is introducing a daily service to Frankfurt Hahn from Kerry Airport in a long-term low cost agreement.
 Flights from Kerry Airport will commence on April 1.
    Ryanair said it remains concerned that the Aer Rianta airport monopoly at Shannon will attempt to impose similar 
price increases on Ryanair's low fare flights between Shannon and Brussels and Shannon and Paris when the 
three year new route scheme ends on those two routes in 2004 and 2005 respectively.
    "The policies of the high cost Aer Rianta monopoly are losing Shannon passengers and routes, as well as 
damaging Irish tourism and Irish jobs. It is time this monopoly was broken up for good, with competing multiple 
terminals developed at Dublin Airport and that Cork and Shannon are separated from the dead hand of Aer Rianta 
and allowed to develop routes and traffic in the interests of Shannon and Cork respectively," said Ryanair in a 
statement.

European markets remained mired in the red at midday, still spooked by fears of renewed terrorist attacks after 
alleged threats from Al-Qaedea head Osama bin Laden and with the UK government tightening security massively 
after it received a "specific terrorist threat" yesterday, dealers said.
    Sentiment was not helped either by a mixed response to Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony to the 
Senate Budget Committee yesterday, and dire news overnight from US tech bellwether Applied Materials.
    At 11.48 am, the Dow Jones Euro STOXX 50 was down 36.49 points at 2186.52, while the Dow Jones STOXX 
600 index slipped 2.64 points to 184.29.
    And there looks to be little respite for Wall Street this afternoon. The Dow is being indicated down 9 points and 
the Nasdaq down 2, with sentiment in the latter likely to be hit by the dire news from Applied Materials after-hours.
    From the onset, the mood in Europe was grim as fears of an imminent terrorist attack were heightened by the 
new message from Osama bin Laden, and a new "ring of steel" around Heathrow airport -- which includes heavily 
armed troops and extra policemen.
    And the deteriorating performance of leading European economies, as illustrated by this morning's "pretty ugly" 
French industrial production data and this morning's reduced GDP growth forecasts for the UK, only added to the 
bleaker tone.
    Earlier, Insee reported that French industrial output slumped 1.7 percent in December from November, well 
above the forecast 0.3 pct fall, while the November rise was revised down to 0.9 pct from 1.2 pct.
Meanwhile the Bank of England in its quarterly inflation report cut its 2003 GDP growth forecast to 2.5 pct, and 
warned that the outlook for inflation is deteriorating.
    The European airline sector flew into trouble this morning as investors fretted about the impact of new terrorism 
warnings on passenger traffic. Certainly, scenes of heavily-armed troops surrounding Heathrow -- London's main 
hub -- and increased security at Manchester airport did little to calm these fears.
    British Airways lost ground, as did did the UK's two other major airlines, Easyjet and Ryanair. And BAA -- the 
owner of Heathrow -- was another casualty, with the stock also being impacted by further comment on Tuesday's 
full year figures. Air France was also on offer ahead of its third quarter numbers, which some suggest could include 
a French government decision to sell-off a further 5 pct stake. SAS, the Scandinavian, airline also lost ground as 
narrowing fourth quarter losses were offset by its refusal to give any earnings guidance for 2003.
Euroshares in the red at midday, airlines, TMTs , insurers lead the way
    And Spanish travel firm Amadeus headed south, reversing opening gains, as its own lack of guidance for 2003 
and fears of a war against Iraq offset stronger-than-expected fourth quarter earnings news. CSFB, however, 
downplayed the absence of current year guidance, repeating its 'outperform' stance and saying it would use any 
weakness on the back of military action in Iraq to build positions.
    But KLM managed to push ahead as it revealed plans to begin buying back up to 4.5 mln of its own shares 
immediately.
    Away from the cyclicals, Axa was among the worst performers in a battered Insurance sector, down 2.52 pct at 
134.87, as investors took fright at a ratings downgrade from Standard and Poor's.
    The agency cut the French insurance giant's long-term credit rating to 'AA-' from 'AA', citing its doubts over 
whether the group will achieve its 2002 operating profit targets.
    The news triggered fears of another round of ratings downgrades to the top European players -- particularly if 
equity markets continue on their downward trajectory.
    Allianz was a notable casualty, also hurt by a grim interview with its chairman Henning Schulte-Noelle in 
tomorrow's Die Zeit. He warned that Allianz's 2002 results will be the "worst for a long time", and admitted that all 
options will be mulled should its Dresdner Bank unit fail to meet targets. He also reaffirmed the group's plans to 
reduce some of its stock holdings. Allianz holds hefty stakes in Munich Re, Schering, BASF, RWE and 
Commerzbank.
    Aegon also posted sharp losses, as did Fortis and ING.
    But Swedish insurer Skandia managed to defy the trend after strong fourth quarter results from the company, and 
news that S&P is raising its long-term counterparty credit rating to 'A' from 'BBB'.
    Renault posted hefty falls in an enfeebled Autos sector, down 3 pct at 143.88, as the French carmaker's cautious 
outlook on operating margins yesterday and its warning of an uncertain outlook for 2003 sparked a slew of negative 
broker comment.
    WestLB Panmure was spooked by the gloomy outlook, and put its outperform stance and 55 eur target under 
review, while Sanford Bernstein -- a long-time bear -- repeated its 'underperform' advice.
    Rival Peugeot, however, managed to recover from its earlier lows as followers took heart from its more optimistic 
noises on margin growth, with this morning's in-line results. Sentiment received a further boost later on as news 
emerged from its conference call that it is mulling a possible share buyback. CAI Cheuvreux maintained its "buy" 
rating in the wake of the news.
    And Deutsche Telekom managed to outperform very weak TMTs, which were spooked by yesterday's dire after-
hours first quarter numbers and gloomy outlook statement from US chip equipment making giant Applied Materials.
    Sentiment in the German incumbent was boosted by an upgrade from Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, and 
positive noises from Merrill Lynch on the European telecoms sector as a whole.
    Dresdner Kleinwort upped Deutsche Telekom to 'add', with a newly-hiked 13.5 eur target amid hopes of strong 
earnings in 2003 and real progress in paying down its hefty debts. The broker also highlighted its attractive free 
cash flows and strong operational momentum, particularly in the mobile phone market.
    Electrolux managed to shine as -- for once -- its fourth quarter numbers proved to be much better than many had 
feared. The firm was also upbeat about prospects for the current year, saying restructuring and cost cutting moves 
should help to boost operating profit this year and offset expected flat demand this year in both Europe and the US.
    Lafarge also stood out on the upside as Merrill Lynch revealed raised its stance to 'neutral' from 'sell', citing the 
recent slump in the French building material group's share price. While it expects further negative news from 
Lafarge and earnings growth downgrades, valuations on earnings, sales and asset value all now point to Lafarge 
trading below average levels, the broker said.       nm/vs

UK blue chips were just on positive ground at midday, treading water in quiet trade ahead of US Secretary of State 
Colin Powell's key address to the UN on Iraq later today, and with US markets set to open under pressure, traders 
said.
    At 12.10 pm the FTSE 100 was up 18.3 points at 3608.4, with all other indices turning higher save the Small Cap 
index.
    Volumes were paltry, with 738.3 mln shares changing hands in just 56,566 transactions.
    In economic news, the latest Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee meeting kicked off today, while in the 
US the ISM January non-manufacturing index will be closely watched after the surprise strength of the ISM 
manufacturing index Monday.
    Economists expect the non-manufacturing data to remain unchanged at 54.7.
    However, the real key for sentiment today will be Powell's keynote speech on Iraq's alleged stock-piling of 
weapons of mass destruction which is expected at 3.30 pm GMT.
    Should Powell fail to convince major world leaders that the evidence against Iraq is compelling enough, then the 
US will have to decide whether to seek a second United Nations resolution or launch its attack on Iraq regardless.
    Blue chips remained fairly aimless awaiting some impetus from Powell's speech, with just a few corporate news 
items to provide direction.
    Amvescap returned to take position as the biggest casualty in midday deals, extending yesterday's post-results 
slide as brokers piled on the cautious comment after yesterday's uninspiring full year figures, with Morgan Stanley 
cutting to 'underweight' from 'equal-weight', citing disappointing flows.
 Amvescap shares had plunged 4 pct, or 13 pence to 310-1/2, as investors switched to Schroders voting shares, up 
2 at 444-1/4, and non-voting, up 11-3/4 at 413.
    British Airways was also a weak spot ahead of its latest traffic figures, particularly after KLM Royal Dutch Airlines 
revealed earlier a decline in overall load factor to 73.4 pct in January from 74.2 pct a year earlier.
London shares just higher in aimless midday trade, awaiting Powell statement
    War concerns added to investor caution, with British Airways down 1-1/2 to 112-1/2, Rolls-Royce down 1-1/4 at 
92-3/4 and BAA losing 6 to 440-1/2. EasyJet was 1/2 pence easier at 223-3/4 while Ranayair jumped into positive 
territory after reporting a 55 pct increase in passengers carried in January, compared to last year.
    Ryanair's load factor increased to 76 pct from 72 pct. For the rolling 12 months it was 85 pct.
    Beleaguered engineer Invensys headed off lows, now down 1-1/2 pence at 45-1/2, after assuring the market that 
its earnings guidance remains unchanged. The firm was attempting to allay fears - reported in this morning's Times 
- that it is to issue a profit warning.
    A spokesman for Invensys said: "We haven't changed the guidance we gave during the interim results 
announcement last November." At that time the group said it expects "second half trading performance in the core 
group to remain at best flat" with first half.
    Elsewhere, auto parts manufacturer GKN was also a steep faller following on from hefty falls in US peers after 
yesterday's disappointing US car sales data for January. Below-consensus fourth quarter numbers from 
DaimlerChrysler yesterday also added to the pressure. GKN shares lost 5-1/2 to 184-1/4, also pressured by news 
the dollar has hit a four year low against the euro.
    Other financial stocks were more mixed towards midday, with insurers recovering some ground, but banks 
remaining unsettled after Commerzbank's record full year losses overshadowed BNP Paribas' top-end numbers.
    Banks remained mixed, with Barclays down 2-3/4 at 362-1/4, Northern Rock turning around to gain 4 to 625 and 
Standard Chartered up 2 at 641.
    Insurers recovered some ground after tripping up on fears over one-off charges after insurance giant AIG added 
a massive 2.8 bln usd to its loss reserves.
    Royal & Sun Alliance shed 1-3/4 to 94-1/4, while Aviva was up 8-1/2 at 421-1/2, and Friends Provident gained 3-
1/4 to 94-1/2.
    Amongst gainers, Scottish Power continued to top the blue chip risers board midmorning, up 15-3/4 pence to 
347-3/4 in the wake of forecast-busting third-quarter results.
    Williams de Broe rates the stock a 'hold' following third-quarter profit before tax, exceptionals and goodwill 
amortisation of 251.8 mln stg, up from 239.7 mln a year earlier, boosted by 20 mln stg of cost savings. Analysts' 
forecasts for the period ranged from 225-231 mln.
    Mobile phone stocks were also in demand as heavyweight Vodafone gained 3 to 111-3/4 on news it has been 
approached by several companies including Ripplewood Holdings about the sale of its fixed-line telecom operations 
in Japan.
    The mobile phone giant also said this morning it has finalised the terms of its proposed minority offers for the 
outstanding shares in its subsidiaries in Sweden and Portugal. It is to offer 47 skr for each Europolitan share and 
8.50 eur per Telecel share, with the total cost of these tender offers expected to reach up to 1.2 bln eur.
    Banc of America upping its stance to 'hold' today on Vodafone, and mmO2 tracked the advance, rallying 2 pence 
to 48-1/2 after easing back on yesterday's trading news.
    Elsewhere on the upside, Compass Group benefited from switch advice and positive broker comment in the 
wake of a disappointing AGM update from French peer Sodexho Alliance.
    Both Goldman Sachs and WestLB Panmure expressed a preference for Compass today -- its shares gained 7-
3/4 at 299-3/4 -- after Sodexho reduced its full year organic growth forecast.
    On the second line, housebuilders were the main feature in a quiet market. A very upbeat statement from 
Bellway triggered a 'buy' note from Arbuthnot -- formerly Old Mutual Securities -- and increased estimates, with its 
full year pretax forecast upped to 150 mln stg from 136 mln.
    The group said it has already reserved, contracted or completed 80 pct of targeted output for the current financial 
year, and in view of this, the board anticipates that the results for the full year to July 31 could now exceed its earlier 
expectations.
London shares just higher in aimless midday trade, awaiting Powell statement
    Moreover it said: "Despite media speculation regarding the housing market, conditions continue to be 
encouraging throughout our areas of operation."
    Bellway shares jumped 21 pence to 486-1/2, Westbury was up 15-1/2 at 265-1/2 and Redrow put on 6 to 246.
    In other news, Rank Group edged up 6-1/2 pence to 234-4/5 as heavyweight broker Merrill Lynch added the 
stock to its core Europe One List, after turning outright buyer of Rank only recently.
    And tech stock Autonomy plunged 9-1/2 pence to 125-1/2 after buying back shares.
    But on the downside, profit takers pulled Kidde back 3-3/4 pence to 62-1/2, with the stock having been lifted 
yesterday by news of a UBS Warburg upgrade.
    And bad news from Swiss recruitment sector peer Adecco knocked Michael Page shares back 5 pence to 96-1/2.
    There were few falling small cap features, with four stocks dropping after moving ex-dividend.
    Otherwise on the upside, financial services firm Kingsgbridge hardened 1/2 pence to 7 after revealing it has 
reached agreement in principle with former director Ross Hyett and certain of his management team for the sale of 
IFP Investments Ltd.
    But no legal agreement has been reached and no financial details were disclosed.
    Elsewhere, Theratase was in demand after its Dutch joint venture partner AM-Pharma Holding BV announced 
yesterday the start of Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of sepsis. Shares were up 2-1/2 at 37-1/2.
    In the mining sector, a Peruvian gold drilling deal provided the spur to Monterrico Metals, 4-1/2 higher at 71, 
while Rolfe & Nolan surged 19 to 97-1/2 in response to the 100 pence-a-share management buy-out offer.
    Meanwhile, comedy and late-night bar operator, Regent Inns was firm, up 6 pence at 62-1/2, after posting in-line 
first-half profits and maintaining its dividend at 1.82 pence. Investors were unfazed by its comment that there has 
been no signs of improved trading conditions throughout January.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair Holdings PLC, said the Irish low-cost airline is "relatively unexposed" to 
a military conflict in the Gulf.
    He told the CNBC business news channel that Ryanair is running with much higher advanced load factors than 
normal with 94 pct of its February seats already sold, has fully hedged its fuel requirements, and is sitting on over 1 
bln eur of cash.
 "So as best we can we are relatively unexposed to a war in Iraq. But clearly we'd be concerned if it lasted a long 
time," he said.
    "If it's short, sharp and quick then I think everybody will get back to normal. If it develops into ways we don't 
expect or results in terrorist attacks in major European cities then clearly we have to go back to the drawing board."
    O'Leary maintained that if there is a war Ryanair's competitors would suffer "grievously more than we will".
    "If the war breaks out we'll be lowering prices, we'll be dumping the fares, we'll be having seat Sales left, right 
and centre. The key thing is to keep people flying during periods of trauma."
    O'Leary was speaking after Ryanair released third quarter results.
    At 8.33 am Ryanair shares were down 6 pence at 433.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Irish low-cost airline that last week acquired loss making rival Buzz from KLM Royal 
Dutch Airlines NV, has raised its guidance for full year profit after tax to 235 mln eur from 230 mln after a better-
than-expected third quarter performance.
    For the third quarter to Dec 31 2002 profit after tax (net profit) was 43.2 mln eur, up from 28.8 mln last year.
Sector analysts had forecast around 39 mln eur.
    The record profit growth was fuelled by record traffic growth.
    Passenger traffic for the quarter grew 46 pct to 3.9 mln and average load factor jumped from 79 pct to 86 pct, 
primarily due to a further 8 pct reduction in fares which had been flagged.
    This reduction in yields reflects the 1 mln free seats promotion last October, the launch of four new routes from 
Frankfurt Hahn in December, and Ryanair's low fares policy.
    Total revenues in the quarter rose 37 pct to 185.9 mln eur, however operating costs rose at a slower rate of 28

(Updating to add more detail from Ryanair Q3 statement)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Irish low-cost airline that last week acquired loss-making rival Buzz from KLM Royal 
Dutch Airlines NV, has raised its guidance for full-year profit after tax to 235 mln eur from 230 mln after a better-
than-expected third quarter performance.
    For the third quarter to Dec 31 2002 profit after tax (net profit) was 43.2 mln eur, up from 28.8 mln last year. 
Sector analysts had forecast around 39 mln eur.
    The record profit growth was fuelled by record traffic growth.
    Passenger traffic for the quarter grew 46 pct to 3.9 mln and average load factor jumped from 79 pct to 86 pct, 
primarily due to a further 8 pct reduction in fares which had been flagged.
    This reduction in yields reflects the 1 mln free seats promotion last October, the launch of four new routes from 
Frankfurt Hahn in December, and Ryanair's low fares policy.
    Total revenues in the quarter rose 37 pct to 185.9 mln eur; however operating costs rose at a slower rate by 28 
pct.
    As a result Ryanair's after-tax margins, during the worst quarter in the year, increased from 21 pct to 23 pct.
    Basic EPS was 5.72 cents versus 3.98 cents, a rise of 44 pct.
    Ryanair, which also ordered another 100 new Boeing aircraft last week, predicted it will carry 24 mln passengers 
in the year to March 2004 -- a figure that would see Ryanair challenge Air France for the position of Europe's third 
largest international scheduled airline.
 "These are another good set of numbers which result from the disciplined way we are rolling out our low fares all 
over Europe," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
    "Ryanair's reducing cost base enables us to continue to drive down air fares. Lower fares mean higher load 
factors on our new larger aircraft, whose lower operating costs in turn result in increased profits. This is a virtuous 
cycle of lower costs, lower fares, faster growth and increasing profits."
    O'Leary said Ryanair continues to be surrounded by opportunities.
    He noted that the average load factor on its four new routes from Frankfurt Hahn in December was over 80 pct, 
advance bookings at its new Milan Bergamo base (start date Feb 6) suggest load factors for the first month of 70-80

pct, and initial customer response to its ninth European base at Stockholm Skavsta (announced last Tuesday) has 
been very encouraging.
    The chief executive defended the purchase of Buzz for a net 5 mln eur as "an opportunity too good to miss", but 
acknowledged "some commentators fear that we are biting off more than we can chew."
    "Fortune favours the brave, and as Warren Buffet has proven many times, the time to buy is when everyone else 
is selling and prices are low. I believe that this is one of those times," he maintained.
    Turning to the recently announced EU investigation of Ryanair's cost base at Brussels Charleroi Airport, O'Leary 
reiterated his belief that the Commissioner for Transport, Loyola de Palacio will rule in favour of Charleroi and the 
Belgian government, as the evidence is overwhelming that there is no element of State aid in its cost base there.
    Ryanair shares closed Monday at 439 pence, capitalising the airline at 3.3 bln stg.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Irish low-cost airline, said he would rather shut down 
Buzz, the loss-making rival it agreed to buy from KLM Dutch Airlines NV for a net 5 mln eur last week, than face the 
prospect of a pilots strike when the acquisition completes in April.
    Speaking at a news briefing, O'Leary confirmed that 20 pct of Buzz's 500 strong London Stansted-based 
workforce will likely lose their jobs.
 He said the Buzz employees who stay must agree to adopt Ryanair's labour practices quickly and warned the 
unions, particularly the British Air Line Pilots Association, not to cause trouble.
    "If BALPA go on strike on April 1, it won't be a question of sacking pilots, we'll close down Buzz."
    "It's losing 30 mln eur a year, we're not going to hang around with extensive negotiations."
    O'Leary was keen to talk up the positives of the deal.
    "This is about saving 400 jobs, not about 100 redundancies," he said.
    He also pointed out that the airline's order for a further 100 Boeing 737-800 aircraft will create 3,000 new jobs

 Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Irish low-cost airline, said he would rather shut 
down Buzz, the loss-making rival it agreed to buy from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV for a net 5 mln eur last week, 
than face the prospect of a pilots strike when the acquisition completes in April.
    Speaking at a news briefing following the release of Ryanair's third-quarter results, O'Leary confirmed that 20 pct 
of Buzz's 570 strong London Stansted-based workforce will likely lose their jobs.
    He said the Buzz employees who stay must agree to adopt Ryanair's labour practices quickly and warned the 
unions, particularly the British Air Line Pilots Association, not to cause trouble.
    "If BALPA go on strike on April 1, it won't be a question of sacking pilots, we'll close down Buzz."
    "It's losing 30 mln eur a year, we're not going to hang around with extensive negotiations."
    O'Leary was keen to talk up the positives of the deal, maintaining that Buzz would have gone out of business if 
Ryanair had not stepped in.
    "This is about saving 400 jobs, not about 100 redundancies," he said.
    He also pointed out that Ryanair's order for a further 100 Boeing 737-800 aircraft will create 3,000 new jobs over 
the nine-year course of their delivery.
    O'Leary intends to retain the majority of Buzz's management with the exception of Floris van Pallandt who will 
return to KLM.
 "We have considerable faith in the management of Buzz, they just haven't been given the tools to do the job," he 
said.
    Buzz currently operates a network of 21 routes from Stansted to points in Germany, Holland, France and Spain, 
as well as two French domestic routes.
    Ryanair plans to rationalise Buzz's operations by closing unprofitable routes.
    O'Leary said routes to be cut include those to Paris Charles de Gaulle, Schipol Amsterdam and Frankfurt Main -- 
primary airports that are expensive to operate out of. Slots at these airports will revert back to KLM.
Ryanair 's O'Leary says would rather close Buzz than face pilots strike UPDATE
    As part of the deal KLM has agreed to take back all of Buzz's BAe 146 aircraft by end-March 2004.
    Due diligence of the Buzz deal is expected to be completed by Feb 14 and a rationalisation plan announced by 
the end of the month.
    This will include a revised summer schedule and confirmation of routes to be cut and routes that will see 
increased frequency.
    By April 1 the Buzz name will cease to exist and its routes incorporated into Ryanair's internet reservation 
system.
    By cutting Buzz fares by around 50 pct, Ryanair reckons it can double the unit's passenger numbers to 4 mln in 
the year to end-March 2004 and deliver a 10 mln eur profit.
    Deputy chief executive Michael Cawley maintained Ryanair's 5 mln eur purchase of Buzz compares very 
favourably to the 397 mln eur easyJet PLC paid for Go-Fly last year.
    He noted that both deals delivered around 4 mln passengers and similar projected profits.
    "They paid 397 mln eur funded by a rights issue. Frankly we're paying petty cash," he said.
    At 2.06 pm shares in Ryanair were down 20 pence at 419.

    Earlier, Ryanair raised its guidance for year to end-March 2003 profit after tax to 235 mln eur from 230 mln after 
a record third quarter to Dec 31 2002 performance.
    Profit after tax (net profit) was 43.2 mln eur, up from 28.8 mln last year and above the 39 mln eur sector analysts 
had forecast.
    The record profit growth was fuelled by record traffic growth.
    Passenger traffic for the quarter grew 46 pct to 3.9 mln and average load factor jumped from 79 pct to 86 pct,

Euroshares opening - More cautious start seen as Wall St drifts off highs

European markets are expected to open the session in more cautious mood, hit by Wall Street's late drift from highs 
as surprise strength of Monday's ISM report and solid construction spending data provided some comfort on the US 
economy, dealers said.
    Sentiment will be further undermined by growing caution on Iraq, with many investors reluctant to move into the 
market too aggressively today ahead of expected new information on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction 
from US Secretary of State Colin Powell tomorrow.
    Overnight, the DJIA closed up 56.01 points at 8,109.82, off an intraday high of 8,152.08. The S&P 500 was up 
4.62 at 860.32 while the Nasdaq composite was up 2.88 at 1,323.79.
    In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index closed down 15.89 points at 8,484.90. And the Hang Seng, after the long Chinese 
New Year holiday, ended the morning session 1.70 points adrift at 9,257.25.
    The main excitement on the economic front will be the the early estimate of euro zone inflation for January, which 
is forecast to show a slight easing in the annual rate.
    But it will be corporate earnings news that will - yet again - dominate.
    In the autos, all eyes will be on the latest results from DaimlerChrysler, due this afternoon. The car giant is 
expected to announce fourth quarter operating profit excluding one-offs of between 962 mln and 1.6 bln eur, 
compared with 564 mln last year, and full year dividend of 1.00-1.35 eur per share from 1.00 eur.
 Analysts are also keen to obtain details on the fourth quarter performance of Mercedes Benz, given a softening in 
the overall luxury market segment, as well as in Chrysler, whose spending for incentives in the period under review 
would have limited upside potential in earnings.
    But early sentiment in the sector could be hurt by the latest US car sales, which showed a fall in January after a 
strong showing in December. Some economists fear car makers are having trouble attracting buyers with their 
historic low interest loans that have been in place in different guises since the fall of 2001.
     Domestic and imported car and light truck sales came in at a seasonally adjusted 16.2 mln unit annual rate in 
December, down 11 pct from an 18.2 mln unit rate in December, according to Autodata Corp.
Euroshares opening - More cautious start seen as Wall St drifts off highs
    Shares in Ryanair, the Dublin-based no-frills airline, are expected to take off in early deals as brokers cheer its 
strong third quarter numbers, raising full year guidance. The upbeat news comes less than a week after Ryanair 
went on a massive buying spree, buying rival Buzz and ordering yet more Boeing jets to expand its fleet. 
    In the TMTs, telecom equipment maker Alcatel is expected to be active after its full year figures and further 
comment on trading in the current year.
Although its full year losses were wider than the market was expecting, investors are expected to take comfort from 
news that it expects a narrowing first quarter loss and a return to profit in the full year, before the impact of 
exceptionals.
    And mm02, the UK mobile phone giant, is expected to run higher after its latest update, which showed a healthy 
4.3 pct increase in new customers in the three months to December, and a surge in revenues from data services.
    In the Media sector, Vivendi Universal is expected to steal the limelight after the apparent departure of the head 
of its Canal Plus operations, dealers said. Some sector watchers suggested that his shock exit could mean that 
Vivendi Universal is moving closer to the sale of the business, which had initially been deferred until 2004 at the 
earliest. 
    Cordiant Communications could see an early rally after the Financial Times reported that yesterday's sale of its 
Australian assets sets the stage for its break-up.
    In the Chemicals, Ciba could be under pressure early on as investors mull its latest full year numbers, which 
came in at the bottom end of the forecast range. The Swiss giant, however, did predict that 2003 sales, margins 
and net profit would be ahead of 2002.
    Later on, UK industrial gases group BOC is expected to report first quarter pretax pre-exceptionals of 92-97 mln 
stg, against 97 mln last time,reflecting pension charges and continuing tough market conditions. But few real 
surprises are expected following its Jan 17 trading update that gave a fairly full account of the factors affecting 
current year's results.
    Shares in E.ON are expected to fall under pressure after the Financial Times reporterd that the German Cartel 
Office has launched a fresh challenge to its planned takeover of Ruhrgas, Europe's largest gas importor.
    And Credit Suisse Group could be under the cosh after its investment arm, CSFB, put its star technology banker 
on leave pending an internal inquiry.
    Elsewhere, insurers, which were in the vanguard of the wider market advance yesterday, could succumb to some 
selling pressure today, though pundits will continue to take heart from further advances in equities on Wall Street 
Monday.
    Looking ahead, French hotels chain Accor will be in focus, with the group expected to report its full year sales 
after-hours this evening.

London shares slip in opening deals after Wall St closed off highs overnight
London shares slip in opening deals after Wall St closed off highs overnight

London's leading shares slipped slightly in opening deals after Wall Street lost some of its firmness later in the 
session, though positive numbers from mmO2 and Ryanair, and news from Abbey National, enlivened the market, 
dealers said.
    But war fears remain and many investors are likely to sideline themselves ahead of new information on Iraq's 
alleged weapons of mass destruction from US Secretary of State Colin Powell tomorrow.
    At 9.01 am, the FTSE 100 was off 16.7 points at 3672.7, having closed up 122 points yesterday. All other indices 
opened lower.
    Meanwhile, 169.8 shares had been exchanged in 15,199 deals.
    Overnight, the DJIA closed up 56.01 points at 8,109.82, off an intraday high of 8,152.08. The S&P 500 was up 
4.62 at 860.32 while the Nasdaq composite was up 2.88 at 1,323.79.
    In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index closed down 15.89 points at 8,484.90. And the Hang Seng, after the long Chinese 
New Year holiday, ended the morning session 1.70 points adrift at 9,257.25.
    On the economic front, in the UK only the January CIPS construction index is scheduled for release, while 
December factory orders are due later this afternoon from the US.
    Turning to corporate news, mobile phone operator mmO2 put in a positive performance after it posted its third-
quarter key performance indicators, which showed a total customer growth just slightly higher than expectations.
    mmO2 said it added 791,000 customers in the three months to Dec 31, a 4.3 pct advance, which took its total 
subscriber base to 19.1 mln.
 The figures were up 4.3 pct on the same three month period a year earlier and 9.2 pct higher when looked at on a 
9-month basis.
    According to a poll of analysts by AFX News, on a 9-month basis a 9 pct rise was expected. From the survey of 
six brokers' forecasts the range for net new additions was 500,000-613,000.
    In addition, mmO2 said it has extended co-operation with T-mobile on the roll-out of 3G in Germany, which will 
result in a reduced capex on 3G there.
    mmO2 shares were up 1/4 at 49 and Vodafone lost 1 to 112-1/2, with investors also eyeing full year numbers 
from France's Alcatel. The telecom equipment maker posted dull figures but a positive outlook.
London shares slip in opening deals after Wall St closed off highs overnight
    In the financial sector, mortgage bank Abbey National was in demand -- up 4-1/2 at 422-1/2 -- after reporting it 
will sell its non-core First National lending business for 848 mln stg in cash to General Electric Co unit GE 
Consumer Finance.
    The sale, a move the firm was expected to make at some point, is in line with the firm's stated strategy of 
refocusing on core UK personal financial services.
    Elsewhere in the sector, Anglo-American money manager AMVESCAP was under pressure in opening deals -- 
down 2-1/2 at 354 -- ahead of its full-year figures at midday.
    The firm is expected to post a pretax profit before exceptionals of 305-380 mln stg, down from 477.9 mln in the 
previous year as both the ongoing volatile equity markets and a weak dollar take their toll, according to analysts.
    But insurers, which led the the wider market surge yesterday, succumbed to some selling pressure. Friends 
Provident dropped 3 to 95-1/4, Aviva lost 8 to 422-1/4, Legal & General fell 1/2 to 80 and Prudential shed 3-3/4 to 
400.
    And remaining with financials, small cap stockbroker Teather & Greenwood dumped 2 pence to 17-1/2 in early 
deals after it proposed a rights issue priced at 12 pence per share to raise 2.9 mln stg.
    In its less-than-rosy update, the broker said as yet it sees no signs of an upturn other than at the fixed interest 
desk.
    But the broker did add it has seen more competitors exit from small and mid-cap broking and it is confident it can 
now weather the trading conditions.
    Amongst other blue-chip gainers, GUS traded higher on news that UBS Warburg has turned outright buyer, with 
a hiked price target. The broker previously rated the stock a 'neutral'. Shares gained 4-1/2 to 516-1/2.
    Mining stock Xstrata moved on 2-1/2 to 552-1/2 after JP Morgan upped the Anglo-Swiss mining group to 
'overweight' from 'neutral' on valuation grounds ahead of full-year results next week.
    But UK industrial gases group BOC was one of the blue-chips to lose out early on, slipping back 40 to 740 after 
reporting a reduced first-quarter pretax before exceptionals of 95.4 mln stg, down from 97.1 mln last time.
    The decline reflects pension charges, continuing tough market conditions and exchange rate movements, which 
offset improved results in every segment of its business, BOC said.
    The numbers were in-line with a forecast range of 92-97 mln stg.
    And BAE Systems lost 1-3/4 to 116 on a report it is actively considering closing some of its pension schemes as 
part of a review into how to tackle the company's rising shortfall in its funds, the Financial Times reported citing the 
company.
    Deteriorating equity markets have led to the deficit at Europe's largest defence group growing from 1.3 bln stg -- 
as measured under new FRS17 disclosure rules at the end of June last year -- to anywhere between 2.3 bln and 3 
bln stg, according to the recent estimates.
    Elsewhere, British Airways lost 2-3/4 to 117 ahead of its January traffic figures tomorrow, and also pressured by 
war fears and robust third-quarter numbers from Ryanair, which knocked 4 pence from EasyJet, now at 225.
    Ryanair, the Dublin-based no-frills airline slipped lower on profit-taking after it raised full year guidance for profit 
after tax to 235 mln eur from 230 mln after a better-than-expected third-quarter performance.
    Ryanair also predicted it will carry 24 mln passengers in the year to March 2004 -- a figure that would see it 
challenge Air France for the position of Europe's third-largest international scheduled airline.
    The upbeat news comes less than a week after Ryanair went on a massive buying spree, buying rival Buzz and 
ordering yet more Boeing jets to expand its fleet.
    There was little in the way of news on the second line to enliven the market, though radio play Chrysalis edged 
up 2 to 189-1/2 after reporting in an AGM statement that current trading remains in-line with expectations.
London shares slip in opening deals after Wall St closed off highs overnight
    Revenue in the radio division for the first five months from Sept 1 to Jan 31 2003 was up 18.6 pct on a like-for-
like basis against the same period last year, in line with company expectations.
    Peer Capital Radio gained 5 to 410.
    Elsewhere, Wood Group continued to be lifted by 'buy' advice yesterday from Williams de Broe, up 6 at 140.
    On the downside, Greene King shed 4 to 665 after its trading update. While the group said the 0.3 pct rise in like-
for-like uninvested managed pub sales in the period was "in-line" with expectations, it represents a slight downturn 
from the 0.5 pct increase reported for the 31 week period to Dec 7.
    Overall, however, they are still in positive territory -- unlike some other operators in the sector -- compared with 
the 0.4 pct decline reported in the first six months of the year.
    Punch Taverns, meanwhile, lost 5-1/2 to 174-1/2.
    Amongst the smaller cap shares, Eurodis dived 14 pct -- or 4 to 23-1/2 -- after revealing widening pretax interim 
losses of 18.9 mln eur compared with a 4.8 mln loss last time, and omitting an interim dividend.
    Given the current uncertainty in the economic environment and the electronics industry, the directors believe it 
would be inappropriate to pay an interim dividend.
    Sherwood International was also under pressure -- down 12 at 71 -- after accompanying a positive full year profit 
outlook with news that this will be achieved on reduced revenues.
    It also warned that it still sees sales delays, and possibly further deterioration in the technology market.
    IFX Power was another weak spot -- off 6 at 74 -- as investors mulled board changes, a sliding full year pretax 
and some cautious outlook comment.
    And a slump in full year profits also saw Chemring fall 12-1/2 to 222-1/2.
    But Winchester Entertainment firmed in early trading after the company said it has reached a settlement with a 
German tax fund which provides for the payment of the outstanding premium interest due from the fund.
    A sum of 2.8 mln stg was originally under dispute. This relates to accrued premium interest on a loan to the fund, 
for film finance in relation to the film 'Last Orders', the capital element of which has been repaid during the year.
    And Bookham Technology put in encouraging early gains -- up 3 at 80 -- as news that it hopes to breakeven by 
the fourth quarter of 2003 offset a widening fourth quarter net loss before exceptionals of 19.9 mln stg. This 
compares with a 14.1 mln stg loss last time.
    The firm expects to cut about 200 jobs at its Milton facility, it said.

Share prices closed just off their highs for the day on Friday on the DJIA in a technical bounce after Thursday's 
heavy sell-off, helped by a raft of broadly positive economic data, which tempered the impact of mixed earning 
news, including lowered guidance from chip equipment maker Applied Materials.
    The Nasdaq composite drifted into negative territory in the last hour of trade on continuing weakness among 
semiconductor equipment stocks and computer hardware issues.
    The DJIA closed up 108.68 points at 8,053.81, just off an intraday high of 8,089.66.
    Twenty-four stocks closed higher while 6 stocks ended the day lower.
    The S&P 500 was up 11.09 at 855.70 while the Nasdaq composite was down 1.44 at 1,320.91.
    Dealers said there was some selling in the last hour of trade as investors remained nervous in a market 
dominated by concerns over geopolitical tensions.
    "We had some short-covering in an oversold bounce," said Tom Schrader, head of listed trading at Legg Mason 
Wood Walker. "In this last half-an-hour we've been selling off a little bit because nobody wants to go home long for 
the weekend."
    Schrader was quite dismissive of the Wall Street adage that the performance of the S&P 500 in January 
foreshadowed the performance of the index and the wider market as a whole.
    "I give no credence to the January effect. I don't think there is any statistical proof to back it up."
    But Brian Piskorowski, equity strategist at Prudential Securities said "January's direction has predicted the annual 
course of the stock market with a 92.3 pct accuracy."
 The S&P 500 shed 2.8 pct in the month of January.
    On the corporate front, Disney was the biggest gainer on the DJIA, climbing 1.15 usd or 7.03 pct at 17.50 usd 
after it said both its earnings before one-off items and sales rose during its first quarter to Dec 31, with its media 
and theme parks units leading the rise in sales despite ongoing economic weakness.
    Boeing, another DJIA component, climbed 93 cents or 3.03 pct to 31.59 usd after the world's largest commercial 
aircraft manufacturer said that Ryanair has ordered 22 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and increased options by a further 
78 aircraft, in a contract worth some 6 bln usd.
Wall Street shares - DJIA closes higher on positive data; Nasdaq down
    Honeywell ended the day up 94 cents or 4.00 pct at 24.44 usd after it said that 2003 earnings will be in line with 
analysts' estimates, with investors also relieved that the group is putting asbestos claims behind it, by taking a 1.9 
bln usd charge in the fourth quarter to cover any compensation.
    McDonald's underperformed the DJIA, down 22 cents or 1.52 pct at 14.24 usd following a downgrade of the 
company's senior notes to 'A' from 'A+' and a revision of the rating outlook to 'negative' from 'stable' by Fitch 
Ratings due to increased competition, weakened operating performance, and the maturing of the US fastfood 
industry.
    Applied Materials was an early focus on the market as the group's share price slumped 98 cents or 7.57 pct to 
11.97 usd after it said first quarter orders would fall 35 pct, well below its previous guidance of a 20 pct drop 
compared with the fourth quarter.
    The news sent the chip sector lower, with rival chip equipment makers leading the fallers.
    KLA-Tencor was down 1.11 usd or 3.29 pct at 32.64 usd while Novellus Systems fell 45 cents or 1.51 pct to 
29.45 usd. Both companies were off their morning lows.
    Among other technology stocks, Dell and Hewlett-Packard were both lower in morning trade after Lehman 
Brothers issued cautious notes on the two computer hardware makers.
    Lehman said that Dell's first quarter expectations are likely to be muted by weak US demand, pricing pressure 
and current geopolitical tensions.
    On HP, Lehman said it is lowering its revenue growth forecast for 2003 to a 1 pct growth from 2 pct on declining 
consumer demand attributed to worries over the geopolitical situation.
    Dell was last down 32 cents or 1.32 pct at 23.86 usd while HP fell 79 cents or 4.34 pct to 17.41 usd.
    In the oil sector, shares in ChevronTexaco Corp edged back into positive territory, closing up 20 cents at 64.40 
usd after mixed fourth quarter results, with strong oil prices boosting upstream earnings but hitting the company's 
downstream operations.
    ExxonMobil, which on Thursday reported forecast-beating fourth quarter earnings, was up 92 cents at 34.15 usd.
    Shares of Dynegy Inc closed down 51 cents or 21.43 pct at 1.87 usd after the company said it lost 423 mln usd, 
or 1.15 usd per share, in the fourth quarter, mainly due to restructuring charges of 213 mln usd and the payment of 
preferred stock dividends of 82 mln usd.

Ryanair 's Bonderman has considered buying Aer Lingus - report
Ryanair's Bonderman has considered buying Aer Lingus - report
AFX European Focus
January 31, 2003 Friday
Copyright 2003 AFX News Limited
Section: COMPANY NEWS
Length: 307 words
Dateline: LONDON
Body
Texas Pacific, an investment company owned by Ryanair PLC chairman David Bonderman, has explored the 
possible purchase of Aer Lingus, the Irish Times reported in its online edition, citing "informed individuals".
    The newspaper said the sources said that Texas Pacific had recently expressed tentative interest to Eire's 
Department of Transport in acquiring part of the state airline, although the government has not yet decided on the 
privatisation.
 A US-based spokesman for Texas Pacific declined to comment last night, the Irish Times said.
    Bonderman owns only a very small but valuable share of Ryanair. With investments worth more than 7 bln eur, 
including the Burger King fast food chain, Texas Pacific specialises in the purchase of troubled companies which it 
then revives.
    In addition to Ryanair, in which it once held a significant stake, the company's other Irish interests have included 
AerFi Group, formerly Guinness Peat Aviation. An attempt last year to acquire Jefferson Smurfit Group PLC was 
unsuccessful.
    The privatisation of Aer Lingus looks unlikely as long as war looms in Iraq, the newspaper said. It is also believed 
the government is keen to finalise the new national pay agreement with trade unions first. After making day-to-day 
profits in excess of 45 mln eur last year, Aer Lingus faces significant pressure on costs at the end of February when 
a pay freeze ends.
    This has the potential to add some 34 mln eur to the bottom line this year from March, eating into the airline's low 
profit margin.
    Because of this pressure on costs, the airline and certain Cabinet members are believed to be keen to advance 
the sale process in advance of any other downturn.

Ryanair to buy KLM 's Buzz for 23.9 mln eur UPDATE
Ryanair to buy KLM's Buzz for 23.9 mln eur UPDATE

(Update to add details throughout)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has reached agreement with KLM to take over Buzz for a total payment of 23.9 mln 
eur in a deal that marks a further milestone in the consolidation in the no-frills airlines industry.
    "The timing of this acquisition is opportunistic. Since Ryanair is growing strongly by rolling out our lowest fare 
services all over Europe, the last thing we need is the distraction of an acquisition. However there are a number of 
features of Buzz which makes this a favourable move," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
    Buzz currently operates a network of 21 routes from London Stansted to points in Germany, Holland, France and 
Spain, as well as two French domestic routes. The acquisition therefore allows Ryanair to further expand at 
Stansted, London's third main airport, and is a timely strategic move.
    Ryanair said it believes that by applying its low fares/low cost formula, the traffic in Buzz can be increased this 
year from under 2 mln in the year to March 2003, to over 4 mln passengers. Buzz will then no longer post an 
operating loss and instead turn profitable.
    The acquisition is expected to make a positive contribution to Ryanair's earnings per share in the coming 
financial year to March 2004.
    The Dublin-based airline said it will fund the deal from its own cash reserves without any recourse to the markets. 
Since Buzz will have 19 mln eur of cash on completion the net cost of this purchase is less than 5 mln.
 Buzz operates a mixed fleet and KLM has agreed to take back all the non-Boeing Co planes - namely BAE 
Systems PLC's BAe 146 aircraft. These will be replaced by more efficient Boeing 737's. Ryanair also said it will 
significantly rationalise Buzz's operations by closing a number of high cost unprofitable routes and operating the 
remaining routes at increased frequency, lower fares and much lower costs.
    "I am confident that this significant and timely rationalisation will eliminate these losses in Buzz over the coming 
year. With a change of aircraft fleet Buzz will be in a position to match Ryanair's low fare, profitable growth from 
2004 onwards," commented O'Leary. "Customers of Buzz can look forward to new routes, increased frequency, 
larger aircraft and significantly lower air fares from April 1 onwards.
    "We will be announcing details of this reorganisation including new routes, frequencies, lower fares and 
timetables before the end of February as we implement our plan to transform Buzz into a growing, profitable 
operation." Ryanair said today's deal is expected to be completed, subject to regulatory approval on April 1.

Shares in Boeing Co pushed higher early morning on news
that the group has received a 6 bln usd aircraft order from Ryanair Holdings
PLC, offsetting a raft of earnings downgrades from analysts in light of
yesterday's quarterly figures, dealers said.
    At 9.43 am, Boeing shares were up 0.65 eur or 2.12 pct at 31.31, while the
DJIA was down 0.61 eur or 0.01 pct at 7,943.70 and the Nasdaq Composite was down
10.80 points or 0.82 pct at 1,311.55.
    Sentiment towards Boeing received a boost today after the group confirmed
that Ryanair has ordered 22 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and increased options by a
further 78 aircraft -- with the the book value of the total order coming to some
6 bln usd.    
    Meanwhile, analysts had been revisiting their earnings estimates overnight
for Boeing after the group's in-line fourth quarter figures.
    JP Morgan said that it has lowered its 2003 EPS forecast for Boeing to 1.90
usd from 2.15, largely due to lower-than-expected margin guidance for the
defensive business.
    Salomon Smith Barney has cut its 2003 EPS forecast for the group to 1.90 usd
from 2.10, reiterating its 'underperform' rating on the stock.
    Trimming its 2003 EPS target for the group by 10 cents to 2.00 usd, Credit
Suisse First Boston said: "From our perspective, the biggest surprise from
yesterday's earnings report and updated outlook was the company's relatively
optimistic 2004 financial guidance."
    "We believe the market had been preparing for a flat-to-down set of numbers

from management for 2004, instead, investors were presented with the flat-to-up
scenario.
 "Now the market will need to evaluate whether or not the company will be
able to deliver on these forecasts, particularly given the precarious condition
of the US airline industry and the numberous macroeconomic and geopolitical wild
cards on the horizon," it said.
    Dealers said that news of the Ryanair order bolstered confidence in Boeing
achieving its targets for 2004 and, indeed, should send analysts again back to the drawing board.

Body
Ryanair Holdings PLC said it reached agreement with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV to take over Buzz for a total 
payment of 23.9 mln eur in a deal that marks a further milestone in the consolidation in the no-frills airlines industry.
    Ryanair said it believes that by applying its low fares/low cost formula, the traffic in Buzz can be increased this 
year from under 2 mln in the year to March 2003, to over 4 mln passengers and the operating losses will be 
eliminated and profitability achieved.
 The Dublin-based airline said it will fund the transaction from its own substantial cash reserves without any 
recourse to the markets. Since Buzz will have 19 mln eur of cash on completion, the net cost of this purchase is 
less than 5 mln.
    Buzz currently operates a network of 21 routes from London Stansted to points in Germany, Holland, France and 
Spain, as well as two French domestic routes.
    Buzz operates a mixed fleet and KLM has agreed to take back all the non-Boeing Co planes - namely BAE 
Systems PLC's BAe 146 aircraft. These will be replaced by more efficient Boeing 737's.
    The acquisition is expected by the directors of Ryanair to make a positive contribution to Ryanair's earnings per 
share in the coming financial year to March 2004.
    Ryanair said today's deal is expected to be completed, subject to regulatory approval on April 1 next.

(Updating with further details)
     Boeing Co confirmed that Ryanair Holdings PLC has ordered 22 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and increased options 
by a further 78 aircraft.
    A Boeing spokesman said the book value of the total order is some 6 bln usd.
 Ryanair's new aircraft order means that, since January last year, the Irish airline has committed to a total of 250 
Boeing 737-800s, worth a total of 15 bln usd. Of those commitments 125 are orders and 125 are options.
    Boeing is the sole supplier of aircraft to Ryanair, which is the US aircraft manufacturer's second largest 737 
customer.
    Both Boeing and rival European airplane builder Airbus have been criticised by analysts for selling planes on the 
cheap in order to gain market share.
    Boeing's vice president of European sales, Marlin Dailey, declined to comment on the actual price paid by 
Ryanair for the planes -- normally carriers pay far less than the catalogue value given by the manufacturer -- but 
said he likes to think "we have struck a fair business relationship with Ryanair. We are happy with our relationship 
with Ryanair at current levels."
    Ryanair earlier this morning said it had agreed to buy its rival no-frills airline Buzz from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines 
NV for 23.9 mln eur.
    Buzz operates a mixed fleet which includes both Boeing 737 and BAE Systems PLC's BAe 146 aircraft and 
Ryanair has said it intends to replace the BAe planes with more efficient 737s.

Leading shares remained lower at midday ahead of a likely flat start on Wall Street, with financial stocks a weak 
sector and war fears weighing on sentiment in a very quiet market, traders said.
    At 12.08pm, the FTSE 100 index was 18.1 points lower at 3,560.6, albeit off an earlier low of 3,510.6, with all the 
broader indices succumbing to sellers.
    Volumes were modest with 834.3 mln shares changing hands in 67,852 deals.
    City Index expects the DJIA to open 5 points higher at 7950 after its 165 point plunge yesterday and the Nasdaq 
2 higher at 1324. But brokers are warning that any gains will be attributable to short-covering in pre-weekend trade, 
rather than anything more encouraging.
    In economic news, a downbeat assessment of the Euro zone economies sparked talk of further future cuts to 
interest rates from the ECB.
    The European Commission said it is sticking to its growth forecasts published in November despite today's weak 
euro zone confidence figures, but warned that since November it has seen "some evidence...that some of the 
downside risks have materialised."
    On the economic calendar later, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index is due. The index is expected to rise to 
52.6, although some economists argued that there was upside to this consensus forecast given the strength of the 
most recent Philly Fed index.
    Meanwhile, the US consumer spending data for December is seen up 0.8 pct in December, after spending rose 
0.5 pct in November.
Personal income is expected to rise 0.2 pct from the previous month, when income rose 0.3 pct.
    And the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment is expected to remain unchanged at 83.7 in the 
final reading for January. The preliminary reading fell from December's 86.7.
    Turning to London's equities, financial stocks were a harsh place to be in midday dealing following on from 
yesterday's rout on Wall Street and a weak morning in the UK.
    Schroders non-voting shares were off 16-3/4 at 404-1/2, Schroders voting lost 14 to 444 and AMVESCAP 
offloaded 8-1/2 to 337-1/4.
London shares remain lower midday ahead of flat Wall St, financials weigh
    Insurers, however, were more mixed at midday, with Legal & General off 2-1/2 at 74-3/4 on solvency concerns, 
but Aviva now up 5-3/4 at 394-3/4 and Prudential up 1 at 376.
    Elsewhere, British Airways traded 4-1/4 lower at 388-3/4 ahead of its third quarter numbers on Tuesday, while 
second liner Ryanair fell further, down 10-1/2 pence to 415-1/2 after announcing the purchase of rival Buzz for 23.9 
mln eur from KLM. Reports that Ryanair is mulling a takeover bid for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus were also weighing 
on the stock.
    But analysts were largely enthusiastic on the takeover news, believing  Ryanair's chief executive Michael O' 
Leary will be able to revive loss-making Buzz, which has never turned a profit and is viewed as one of the weaker 
players in the budget airline sector.
    Ryanair is also scheduled to hold a joint press conference with Boeing later today, and according to a Wall Street 
Journal report, Ryanair will announce an order for as many as 100 Boeing 737-800 aircraft worth some 6 bln usd.
    Elsewhere, BAE Systems was off 2-1/4 at 110 as investors fretted over the diminished role the aero-engineer is 
to take in the future aircraft carrier contract with the Ministry of Defence.
    Broker Julius Baer reiterated its 'reduce' tag, saying the terms of the contract do not favour BAE Systems and, 
moreover, demonstrate the MoD's lack of confidence in the firm's project management skills, since it is to closely 
control the management of the contract.
    And UBS Warburg was also a bear, repeating its 'reduce' tag as the contract is of minimal value to BAE, at just 
10 pence per share, and warning of the massive and ever-increasing hole in BAE's pension fund. This has risen to 
2.251 bln stg compared to the 1.3 bln mln the firm reported midway through 2002, UBS Warburg believes.
    But airports operator BAA was a star performer throughout the morning, up 10 at 452 on news that Goldman 
Sachs initiated coverage of the airports operator's stock with an 'outperform' recommendation.
    The broker feels that once the "uncertainty" surrounding Iraq dissipates, BAA's "benign" regulatory review and an 
unwinding of some of the construction risk will usher in a period of outperformance.
    Returning to the weak areas, the chemicals sector was also largely weak after Dow Chemicals' disastrous fourth-
quarter results and job cut news yesterday.
    ICI fell 6-1/2 pence to 196-1/2, with Yule Catto losing 11 to 245-1/2 and Croda down 4-1/2 to 215-1/2. But BOC 
was higher, up 12 at 778.
    On the upside, Compass Group topped the FTSE 100 -- up 7 at 296-1/2 -- after the European Commission said it 
has cleared the acquisition by Aldeasa and Compass Group Holding Spain of joint control of Foodlasa which is 
presently wholly owned by Aldeasa.
    Shell was also in focus, on news E.ON is to acquire its Ruhrgas stakes. The shares, however, tripped lower after 
a spike, down 1/2 at 366-3/4 while BP was off 1/4 at 382-1/4.
    But otherwise, a severe lack of newsflow threw broker recommendations into the spotlight:
    Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein upgraded Hays to 'hold' from 'sell'  following yesterday's reports that it is 
sounding out potential bidders for its logistics activities. Shares gained 1-1/4 to 77-1/4.
    Mining group Rio Tinto also remained higher, up 6 at 1125 on the back of a UBS Warburg upgrade to a 'buy' from 
'neutral' following solid 2002 results.
    Amongst second liners, house builders remained the weakest sector through the morning following on from 
Schroder Salomon's downgrade on the sector to 'underweight' from 'overweight'.
    The broker expects that sector trends will significantly worsen this year. Persimmon and George Wimpey were 
both lowered to 'underperform' from 'in-line' as part of the review, while Barratt Developments, Wilson Bowden and 
Westbury were all moved to 'in-line' from 'outperform'.
    Westbury was the weakest in the sector, off 11 at 243-1/2, Barratt Developments lost 13-1/2 to 359, Wilson 
Bowden lost 25 to 673-1/2, and Persimmon lost 13 to 405.
London shares remain lower midday ahead of flat Wall St, financials weigh
    And the weak trend also continued amongst the minnows, with Loades offloading 20 pence to 52-1/2 after it 
revealed it will delay its AGM and the release of its full year results since it is in the process of selling its 
manufacturing operations at Abbey Panels Limited in Coventry.
    It now plans to finalise the accounts in March and hold the AGM in April.
    Ladieswear manufacturer Slimma was also declining, off 6-1/2 at 41-1/2, after warning that first-half profits will be 
lower than the year before, hit by a 350,000 stg reorganisation cost.
    Alphyra Group remained off 25 at 151 after the company revealed that talks with First Data Corp have ceased, 
while Fairplace Consulting was down 13-1/2 pence at 83-1/2 after admitting that it is considering a mandatory 75 
pence per share bid by Select Appointments for the company.
    On the upside, Forever Broadcasting jumped almost 15 pct -- or 5 to 38-1/2 -- on news that bid talks with a 
number of parties are ongoing, and an upbeat first quarter trading statement.
    Alpha Airports rose 5 to 54 after announcing that trading in the second half of the year 2003 has been in line with 
expectations.
    Marchpole held onto 0.25 pence gains to 3.87 after unveiling a "significant" rise in operating profit and sales for 
the third quarter against the previous quarter.
    And McInerney added 7-1/2 pence to 147-1/2 after saying that results for the year to Dec 31 2002 will exceed 
2001.

Leading shares are seen opening sharply lower, taking their cue from the overnight rout on Wall Street, where 
investors fretted over the impact of a war with Iraq on the fragile global economy, dealers said. 
     Spreadbetting group CityIndex sees the FTSE 100 opening 70 points lower after closing at 3,578.7 yesterday.
    Overnight, the DJIA closed down 165.58 points at 7,945.13, just off its intraday low of 7,938.62, the second time 
it has closed below the 8,000 level this week. The S&P 500 was down 19.79 at 844.57 while the Nasdaq composite 
was down 35.96 at 1,322.10.
    But in Asia, there was some tentative buying and the Nikkei 225 index closed up 23.13 points at 8,339.94. The 
Hong Kong market was closed for the start of the long Chinese New Year holiday.
    In the absence of any significant corporate leads first thing this morning, economic issues took centre stage, with 
the latest forecast for UK economic bound to perturb investors.
    The National Institute for Economic and Social Research became the latest economic think tank to slash its UK 
GDP growth forecast for 2003. The respected body is now forecasting growth of 2.2 pct in 2003, down from 2.5 pct 
previously, as slowing exports put a drag on the relative strength of the consumer and public sectors. 
    Later today, all attention will shift to the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which is expected to rise to 52.6 in 
January after it fell 3 points to 1.7 in December.
Some economists, however, said that the index could come in even higher, especially after the recent strength of 
the Philly Fed index.
   Meanwhile, the US consumer spending data for December is seen up 0.8 pct in December, after spending rose 
0.5 pct in November. Personal income is expected to rise 0.2 pct from the previous month, when income rose 0.3 
pct.
   And the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment is expected to remain unchanged at 83.7 in the 
final reading for January. The preliminary reading fell from December's 86.7.
   The chemicals sector is expected to come under intense pressure in opening trades after Dow Chemicals' 
disastrous fourth-quarter results and job cut news hit the US sector hard overnight.
   News that Dow's Union Carbide unit was hit by asbestos claims is also likely to impact UK stocks with asbestos 
exposure.
London shares outlook - sharply lower after US overnight falls
    Meanwhile Ryanair will be in focus this morning after announcing the purchase of Buzz for 23.9 mln eur from 
KLM. The no-frills airline is also scheduled to hold a joint press conference with Boeing later today. 
    According to a Wall Street Journal report, Ryanair will announce an order for as many as 100 Boeing 737-800 
aircraft worth some 6 bln usd.
    United Business Media's will also be active after its December continuing titles share rose to 26.1 pct, compared 
to 24.6 pct the previous year.
    And in small cap news, Osmetech is seen opening lower after announcing the purchase of Roche's US blood gas 
analyser unit for 2.5 mln usd.
    Broker moves are likely to provide much of the stock specific direction this morning, with mmO2 likely to 
outperform after Deutsche Bank raised its rating on the mobile operator to 'hold' from 'sell' on valuation grounds.
    The same broker is also repeated 'buy' advice on AstraZeneca and BAE Systems this morning.

Leading shares held off their worst levels but remained lower, with housebuilders and chemical issues among those 
to fall back after weak corporate earnings news across the Atlantic overshadowed some mixed US economic data 
and led Wall Street to meander, dealers said.
    At 3.34 pm, the FTSE 100 index was down 18.0 points to 3,560,7. It had hit a low of 3,510.6 in early deals, and 
had failed to turn positive all session.
    The wider indices were also negative, while volume was modest: just 1.7 bln shares changed hands in 140,155 
deals.
    Meanwhile, the DJIA was up 19.02 points to 7,964.72 and the Nasdaq composite had fallen back 1,307.02 as a 
profit warning from chip equipment maker Applied Materials weighed on the technology issues.
    The fall came despite data showing US personal spending and personal income growth remained strong.
    US consumer spending rose 0.9 pct in December, while personal income was up 0.4 pct -- both higher than 
market expectations.
    The consensus of Wall Street forecasters called for a 0.8 pct increase in consumer spending, while income was 
expected to increase 0.2 pct.
    But the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index fell by a worse-than-expected 82.4 in the final January 
reading from 83.7 in the preliminary reading. Analysts had expected consumer sentiment to remain unchanged.
    In London, chemicals stocks were under pressure following Dow Chemicals' disastrous fourth-quarter results and 
job cut news yesterday.
    ICI gave up 6-1/4 pence to 196-3/4 as worries continued in front of the firm's results announcement due next 
Tuesday.
Dresdner KW became the second leading broker in as many days to cut figures, slicing earnings and dividend 
expectations for the next three years -- although the broker reckoned talk of an impending profits warning is 
unfounded.
    Yule Catto, ICI's midcap competitor, lost 11 pence to 245-1/2.
    Balancing these falls, hotels issues returned to favour as investors looked for bargains in the beaten-down 
sector, with talk of upcoming news on Six Continents' pubs demerger adding a little excitement.
London shares remain lower midafternoon as Wall Street meanders
    Six Continents took on 34 pence to 1,149, while Hilton Group led the FTSE 100 risers with a gain of 5-1/4 to 155-
1/2 following its recent upgrade by Schroder.
    Ryanair's 23.9 mln stg purchase of Buzz from KLM provided the day's main corporate news, with the acquisition 
receiving a welcome from analysts and a cautious reception from shareholders.
    The sell-side saw Ryanair's deal as boosting the Dublin-based carrier's European operations at very little cost. 
But some worried that, with Buzz having never turned a profit, Ryanair could be putting its premium rating in 
jeopardy trying to turn around one of the weaker players in the budget airline sector.
    Ryanair is also announced an order for as many as 100 Boeing 737-800 aircraft worth some 6 bln usd.
    Ryanair was down 4-1/2 pence to 421-1/2 by midafternoon.
    Back in the blue-chips, airports operator BAA was ahead 4-1/2 pence to 446-1/2 after Goldman Sachs initiated 
coverage with an 'outperform' recommendation.
    Once the uncertainty surrounding Iraq dissipates, BAA's "benign" regulatory review and an unwinding of some of 
the construction risk will allow outperformance, the broker argued. This call came before Monday's results from the 
firm.
    GlaxoSmithKline took on 37 pence to 1,152 in anticipation of its results due Wednesday Feb 12, with confidence 
bolstered by AstraZeneca's well-received figures yesterday.
    Yesterday's upgrade to 'hold' by Dresdner KW continued to underpin Hays, up 2 pence to 78, while BOC rallied 
3-1/2 to 769-1/2 ahead of next Tuesday's first quarter earnings.
    And United Utilities was boosted by news that its asset management business has been named one of the 
preferred bidders on a 1.8 bln stg contract to provide asset management services to Scottish Water from April 2003. 
Shares put on 2-1/2 pence to 579-1/2.
    House builders were the midcaps' weakest sector after Schroder Salomon downgraded on the sector to 
'underweight' from 'overweight'.
    The US broker told clients expects that sector trends will significantly worsen this year as consumer confidence 
falls away. Persimmon and George Wimpey were both lowered to 'underperform' from 'in-line' as part of the review, 
while Barratt Developments, Wilson Bowden and Westbury were all moved to 'in-line' from 'outperform'.
    Barratt Developments gave up 16 pence to 356-1/2, Wilson Bowden was weaker by 27-1/2 to 671 and Westbury 
fell back 8-1/2 to 246.
    It was another tough day for Galen Holdings, which returned 19 pence of yesterday's rally to 320 pence as Merrill 
Lynch reiterated 'neutral' -- although the broker did comment that, with the generic risks now understood, the drugs 
developer's valuation is looking more attractive.
    Profit-taking also weighed on Acambis, down 10 pence to 208-1/2 after its upbeat trading statement earlier this 
week.
    Meanwhile, Aquarius Platinum faded 9 pence to 277-1/2 after reporting a sharp decline in profits for the first half 
to end-December 2002, hit by the weakening of the US dollar against the South African rand.
    Stagecoach Group led on the upside with a gain of 3 pence to 33 after founders Brian Souter and Ann Gloag 
raised their stakes in the company by buying a total of 13.39 mln shares.
    Loades was the session's worst performer, down 20 pence to 52-1/2 after the vehicle body designer delayed its 
AGM and the release of its full year results while it sells its Coventry-based manufacturing operations.
    The firm, which built many of Jaguar's prototypes, now plans to finalise the accounts by April.
    Elsewhere in the smaller caps, Blazepoint dropped 0.37 pence to 1.50 after chairman Roger Wadsworth bailed 
out the ruggedized equipment maker with a loan of 806,000 stg to provide additional working capital.
London shares remain lower midafternoon as Wall Street meanders
    News of a banking agreement also failed to spark interest Topnotch Health Clubs, down 0-3/4 pence to 5 after it 
negotiated twelve months' grace with lenders and posted a narrowing interim loss. The firm said first half trading 
was difficult due to the challenging market conditions.
    Alphyra Group dipped 24 pence to 152 on news that bid talks with First Data Corporation have ceased, while 
Slimma gave up 6-1/2 at 41-1/2 after warning of a fall in first-half profits.
    Meanwhile, Fairplace Consulting was down 13-1/2 pence at 83-1/2 after admitting it is weighing up a mandatory 
75 pence per share bid by Select Appointments.
    On the upside, Forever Broadcasting was ahead 5 pence to 38-1/2 after a bright trading statement and a 
reassurance that bid talks with a number of parties are ongoing.
    Gladstone firmed 0-1/2 pence to 4.20 after chief executive Ben Merrett lifted his own shareholding to 1.29 pct via 
the purchase of 79,175 shares at 3.5 pence each. Non-executive director Jeremy Stokes was also spotted building 
his stake.
    News that the Italian ministry of Defence had granted Gold Mines of Sardinia access to a new concession helped 
offset a fall in the prospector's quarterly gold production. Shares hardened a penny to 9-1/2. Alpha Airports rose 5 
to 54 after announcing that trading in the second half of the year 2003 has been in line with expectations.
    Designer menswear maker Marchpole held onto 0.25 pence gains at 3.87 after unveiling a "significant" rise in 
operating profit and sales for the third quarter against the previous quarter.
    And McInerney added 7-1/2 pence to 147-1/2 after saying that results 2002 will improve on 2001.

Leading shares remained lower in midmorning deals following the steep falls on Wall Street overnight, weighed 
down by on-going fears that a US-led war on Iraq could send the fragile global economy into recession, dealers 
said.
    By 9.48 am, the FTSE 100 index was 31.6 points lower at 3,547.1, albeit off an earlier low of 3,510.6, with all the 
broader indices trading sharply lower.
    Volumes were moderate with 326.6 mln shares changing hands in 26,616 deals.
    There was a dearth of significant corporate leads this morning, leaving investors to mull the latest forecast cut to 
UK economic growth.
    The National Institute for Economic and Social Research became the latest economic think-tank to slash its UK 
GDP growth forecast for 2003. The respected body is now forecasting growth of 2.2 pct in 2003, down from 2.5 pct 
previously, adding weight to arguments that the government's 2.5-3.0 pct target is overly optimistic.
    Later today, attention will shift to the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which is expected to rise to 52.6, 
although some economists argued that there was upside to this consensus forecast given the strength of the most 
recent Philly Fed index.
    Meanwhile, the US consumer spending data for December is seen up 0.8 pct in December, after spending rose 
0.5 pct in November. Personal income is expected to rise 0.2 pct from the previous month, when income rose 0.3 
pct.
    And the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment is expected to remain unchanged at 83.7 in the 
final reading for January.
The preliminary reading fell from December's 86.7.
    Insurance stocks bore the brunt of the selling in early deals, as the latest lurch downwards on global stock 
markets once again revived solvency fears in the sector.
    Royal & Sun Alliance dropped 2-1/4 pence to 97-3/4, Legal & General slid 2-1/4 to 75 and Prudential dipped 4 to 
371.
    Other financial issues also suffered, with Abbey National down 10-1/2 to 392 and AMVESCAP losing 14 to 331-
3/4.
London shares remain lower midmorning on Wall Street falls, Iraq war fears
    The chemicals sector was another area of weakness, still reeling from Dow Chemicals' disastrous fourth-quarter 
results and job cut news yesterday.
    ICI fell 4-1/2 pence to 198-1/2, while Alliance Unichem dropped 12-1/4 to 403-3/4.
    Second liners were even harder hit, with Yule Catto losing 11 to 245-1/2 and Croda down 5 to 215.
    And Ryanair lost 6 pence to 420 after announcing the purchase of rival Buzz for 23.9 mln eur from KLM. Reports 
that Ryanair is mulling a takeover bid for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus were also weighing on the stock.
    The no-frills airline is also scheduled to hold a joint press conference with Boeing later today, and according to a 
Wall Street Journal report, Ryanair will announce an order for as many as 100 Boeing 737-800 aircraft worth some 
6 bln usd.
    BAA was one of a handful of blue-chip risers this morning, gaining 7-1/2 to 449-1/2 on news that Goldman Sachs 
initiated coverage of the airports operator's stock with an 'outperform' recommendation.
    The broker feels that once the "uncertainty" surrounding Iraq dissipates, BAA's "benign" regulatory review and an 
unwinding of some of the construction risk will usher in a period of outperformance.
    A broker upgrade also lifted Hays.  Shares in the group rose 0-1/2 pence to to 76-1/2 after Dresdner Kleinwort 
Wasserstein upgraded the support services group to 'hold' from 'sell' following yesterday's reports that it is sounding 
out potential bidders for its logistics activities.
    Rio Tinto was another gainer, up 8 to 1127 after UBS Warburg upgraded its recommendation on the mining 
group to a 'buy' from 'neutral' following solid 2002 results.
    On the second line, house builders were the worst performing issues after Schroder Salomon downgraded the 
sector to 'underweight' from 'overweight' on expectations that sector trends will significantly worsen this year. 
Persimmon and George Wimpey were both lowered to 'underperform' from 'in-line' as part of the review, while 
Barratt Developments, Wilson Bowden and Westbury were all moved to 'in-line' from 'outperform'.
    Wilson Bowden lost 35-1/2 pence to 663, and Persimmon slid 17-1/2 to 400-1/2. Barratt Developments fell 15-1/2 
to 357 and Westbury dropped 12-1/2 to 242.
    Among the tiddlers, Alphyra Group slumped 26 pence to 150 after the company revealed that talks with First 
Data Corp have ceased.
    Meanwhile, Fairplace Consulting lost 13-1/2 pence to 83-1/2 after admitting that it is considering a mandatory 75 
pence per share bid by Select Appointments for the company.
    Osmetech was another faller, losing 0.10 pence to 3.22 after buying Roche's Atlanta-based OPTI business for a 
net 2.5 mln usd. As part of the deal, Roche will take a 4.47 pct stake in Osmetech.
    On the upside, Forever Broadcast surged 3 pence to 36-1/2 after releasing an upbeat first quarter trading 
statement, in which the company announced that it is in bid talks.
    Alpha Airports rose 3 to 52 after announcing that trading in the second half of the year 2003 has been in line with 
expectations.
    In other news, Marchpole rose 0.25 pence to 3.87 after unveiling a "significant" rise in operating profit and sales 
for the third quarter against the previous quarter.
    And McInerney added 7-1/2 pence to 147-1/2 after saying that results for the year to Dec 31 2002 will exceed 
2001.

(Updating with full report)
     Share prices closed just off their highs for the day on the DJIA in a technical bounce after yesterday's heavy sell-
off, helped by a raft of broadly positive economic data, which tempered the impact of mixed earning news, including 
lowered guidance from chip equipment maker Applied Materials.
    The Nasdaq composite drifted into negative territory in the last hour of trade on continuing weakness among 
semiconductor equipment stocks and computer hardware issues.
    The DJIA closed up 108.68 points at 8,053.81, just off an intraday high of 8,089.66.
    Twenty-four stocks closed higher while 6 stocks ended the day lower.
    The S&P 500 was up 11.09 at 855.70 while the Nasdaq composite was down 1.44 at 1,320.91.
    Dealers said there was some selling in the last hour of trade as investors remained nervous in a market 
dominated by concerns over geopolitical tensions.
    "We had some short-covering in an oversold bounce," said Tom Schrader, head of listed trading at Legg Mason 
Wood Walker. "In this last half-an-hour we've been selling off a little bit because nobody wants to go home long for 
the weekend."
    Schrader was quite dismissive of the Wall Street adage that the performance of the S&P 500 in January 
foreshadowed the performance of the index and the wider market as a whole.
    "I give no credence to the January effect. I don't think there is any statistical proof to back it up."
    But Brian Piskorowski, equity strategist at Prudential Securities said "January's direction has predicted the annual 
course of the stock market with a 92.3 pct accuracy."
 The S&P 500 shed 2.8 pct in the month of January.
    On the corporate front, Disney was the biggest gainer on the DJIA, climbing 1.15 usd or 7.03 pct at 17.50 usd 
after it said both its earnings before one-off items and sales rose during its first quarter to Dec 31, with its media 
and theme parks units leading the rise in sales despite ongoing economic weakness.
Wall Street shares - DJIA closes higher on positive data; Nasdaq down UPDATE
    Boeing, another DJIA component, climbed 93 cents or 3.03 pct to 31.59 usd after the world's largest commercial 
aircraft manufacturer said that Ryanair has ordered 22 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and increased options by a further 
78 aircraft, in a contract worth some 6 bln usd.
    Honeywell ended the day up 94 cents or 4.00 pct at 24.44 usd after it said that 2003 earnings will be in line with 
analysts' estimates, with investors also relieved that the group is putting asbestos claims behind it, by taking a 1.9 
bln usd charge in the fourth quarter to cover any compensation.
    McDonald's underperformed the DJIA, down 22 cents or 1.52 pct at 14.24 usd following a downgrade of the 
company's senior notes to 'A' from 'A+' and a revision of the rating outlook to 'negative' from 'stable' by Fitch 
Ratings due to increased competition, weakened operating performance, and the maturing of the US fastfood 
industry.
    Applied Materials was an early focus on the market as the group's share price slumped 98 cents or 7.57 pct to 
11.97 usd after it said first quarter orders would fall 35 pct, well below its previous guidance of a 20 pct drop 
compared with the fourth quarter.
    The news sent the chip sector lower, with rival chip equipment makers leading the fallers.
    KLA-Tencor was down 1.11 usd or 3.29 pct at 32.64 usd while Novellus Systems fell 45 cents or 1.51 pct to 
29.45 usd. Both companies were off their morning lows.
    Among other technology stocks, Dell and Hewlett-Packard were both lower in morning trade after Lehman 
Brothers issued cautious notes on the two computer hardware makers.
    Lehman said that Dell's first quarter expectations are likely to be muted by weak US demand, pricing pressure 
and current geopolitical tensions.
    On HP, Lehman said it is lowering its revenue growth forecast for 2003 to a 1 pct growth from 2 pct on declining 
consumer demand attributed to worries over the geopolitical situation.
    Dell was last down 32 cents or 1.32 pct at 23.86 usd while HP fell 79 cents or 4.34 pct to 17.41 usd.
    In the oil sector, shares in ChevronTexaco Corp edged back into positive territory, closing up 20 cents at 64.40 
usd after mixed fourth quarter results, with strong oil prices boosting upstream earnings but hitting the company's 
downstream operations.
    ExxonMobil, which yesterday reported forecast-beating fourth quarter earnings, was up 92 cents at 34.15 usd.
    Shares of Dynegy Inc closed down 51 cents or 21.43 pct at 1.87 usd after the company said it lost 423 mln usd, 
or 1.15 usd per share, in the fourth quarter, mainly due to restructuring charges of 213 mln usd and the payment of 
preferred stock dividends of 82 mln usd.

Share prices were lower at midday, tracking overnight Wall Street losses after the AEX yesterday rose nearly 4 pct, 
dealers said.
    At 12.13 pm, the AEX index was down 6.16 points at 286.78 after opening at 286.89 and hitting an early low of 
284.23.
    Government bond yields were broadly higher while the euro was bid at 1.0828 usd.
    Yesterday's strong gains were short-lived as Dutch shares tracked overnight losses on the DJIA and Nasdaq due 
to the ongoing threat of a war with Iraq, and on economic concerns following weak US GDP figures, dealers said.
    With US futures slightly higher, all eyes are focused on the release of a string of US macroeconomic data later 
this afternoon, they said.
    Stroeve analysts said the AEX index may well continue to recover if a closing level of at least 280 points remains 
intact. If not, they do not rule out a drop in the index to as low as 260 points.
    KLM gave up yesterday's gains, down 0.40 to 7.45. The airline said it is selling its loss-making low-cost carrier 
Buzz to Ryanair for 23.9 mln eur. Analysts at SNS Securities said the price appears low.
    Heavyweight financials were among the biggest decliners, with Aegon down 0.43 to 11.25, ABN Amro off 0.37 to 
13.78 and ING down 0.51 to 13.67.
    Royal Dutch Petroleum declined 0.63 to 37.81.
    Philips was down 0.39 to 15.39. The company said it will restructure its European TV production operations.
ASML shed 0.15 to 7.36 and Getronics dropped 0.01 to 0.24.
    KPN traded 0.14 lower at 6.35 and TPG fell 0.30 to 14.06 amid speculation the European Commission is set to 
send a letter to the Dutch government next week in an attempt to put an end to its large stakes in the companies.
    Heineken edged 0.07 lower to 32.51 after the brewer and Interbrew said they have ended their Italian licence and 
distribution agreements from March 1. Unilever declined 1.20 to 50.95 and Ahold was 0.36 lower at 11.31.
    Among notable gainers, Wolters Kluwer gained 3 pct to 14.05 and VNU put on 0.49 to 24.0.
    Vedior slid 0.09 to 5.01. The company said late yesterday that it raised its stake in UK's Fairplace to 40.5 pct and 
will bid 75 pence per share for all remaining shares.

Share prices are expected to open higher in a technical rebound after yesterday's heavy sell-off, with better-than-
expected consumer spending and personal income data for December likely to provide early support, dealers said.
    Investors will be paying close attention to any news filtering out of President George W Bush's meeting with UK 
prime minister Tony Blair. Any suggestion that Blair will attempt to seek a second resolution on Iraq could unsettle 
the markets as it would prolong the period of uncertainty and any final resolution on the tense geopolitical situation, 
dealers said.
    At 8.49 am, the DJIA March futures contract was up 45.00 at 7,945.00, with the S&P 500 March futures contract 
up 4.80 at 844.80, while the Nasdaq 100 March futures contract was up 2.50 at 989.50.
    "We're going to need one heck of a rally today to get a bullish reading from the January barometer," said Brian 
Piskorowski, equity strategist at Prudential Securities. "January's direction has predicted the annual course of the 
stock market with a 92.3 pct accuracy. Going into the final session of the month the S&P 500 is down 4.00 pct year-
to-date."
    Disney is expected to post gains in early trade after it said both its earnings before one-off items and sales rose 
during its first quarter to Dec 31, with its media and theme parks units leading the rise in sales despite ongoing 
economic weakness.
    Boeing is likely to move higher after the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer said that Ryanair has 
ordered 22 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and increased options by a further 78 aircraft, in a contract worth some 6 bln 
usd.
 Gains however could be capped by JP Morgan's decision to lower its 2003 EPS estimate on the aircraft 
manufacturer "largely due to lower-than-expected margin guidance for the defence business."
    Among biotech stocks, Biogen was trading higher pre-bourse after it said its Amevive drug for treating the skin 
condition psoriasis has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
    In technology, Dell and Hewlett-Packard are expected to come under pressure after Lehman Brothers issued 
cautious notes on the two computer hardware makers.
    Lehman said that Dell's first quarter expectations are likely to be muted by weak US demand, pricing pressure 
and current geopolitical tensions.

(Updating with full report)
     The AEX index finished the day with a small gain, as a late rally pulled the index out of negative territory 
following better-than-expected Chicago PMI figures and gains on the DJIA, dealers said.
    The AEX index closed just off the day's high, up 2.00 points at 294.94 after opening at 286.89 and hitting an early 
low of 284.23.
    Government bond yields were broadly higher, while the euro was bid at 1.0744 usd.
    Pulling the market into the black were ABN Amro, up 0.35 eur to 14.50 and Fortis, closing 0.33 higher at 14.56.
    ING fell 0.05 to 14.13, following another report the group may acquire Capitalia's online broker Entrium for 
around 300 mln eur.
    KLM gave up yesterday's gains, finishing down 5.7 pct to 7.40. The airline said it is selling its loss-making low-
cost carrier Buzz to Ryanair for 23.9 mln eur, including some 19 mln eur in cash held by Buzz.
    In the tech sector, ASML was hit by a warning from rival Applied Materials that first-quarter orders will fall more 
than expected. ASML fell 3.5 pct to 7.25 and ASMI lost 0.55 to 10.59.
    Philips closed up 0.21 to 15.80. The company said it will restructure its European TV production operations. 
Getronics dropped 0.02 to 0.23 and LogicaCMG fell 0.05 to 1.82.
    KPN closed 0.04 higher at 6.53 and TPG fell 0.25 to 14.11 amid speculation the European Commission is set to 
send a letter to the Dutch government next week in an attempt to put an end to its large stakes in the companies.
 Heineken added 0.97 at 33.55 after it and Interbrew said they will end their Italian licence and distribution 
agreements from March 1.

week to close up 0.20 eur at 13.85. VNU put on 0.76 to 24.27.
    Royal Dutch Petroleum rose 0.13 to 87.05, undeterred by poor results from rival ChevronTexaco, while Akzo 
Nobel lost 0.65 to 24.45.

The temporary closure of Stansted airport caused by the severe wintery weather conditions will have no material 
financial impact on Ryanair Holdings PLC, which operates 44 routes out of the airport, said sales and marketing 
head Sinead Finn.
    Although the discomfort to passengers caused by the closure will be substantial, the effect of the closure "is 
insignificant in financial terms," she told AFX News at the sidelines of a press conference at which she had to stand 
in for Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the Irish no-frills airline.
    O'Leary, who was due in London to speak about a multi-billion dollar aircraft order and the acquisition of rival 
low-cost airline buzz, was among the thousands of airline passengers left stranded by the bad weather as his 
Ryanair flight from Dublin to Stansted was cancelled.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV chief financial officer Rob Ruijter said the carrier will maintain its low-cost operations 
through Basiqair, part of KLM's 100 pct subsidiary Transavia.
    This morning KLM announced the sale of Buzz to Ryanair Holdings Plc for around 30 mln eur.
 "We are discontinuing the more opportunistic operations of Buzz," the CFO said following news of the sale, noting 
that Basiqair has a lower risk profile.
    "Expansion plans (for Buzz) would have required significant investment going forward," he said, adding that the 
low-cost carrier never turned a profit.
    The CFO declined to say whether KLM will report a book profit on the sale.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin based no-frills airline, and Boeing Co, the US aircraft manufacturer, are to hold a 
joint media conference on Friday, prompting speculation they will announce details of a new order.
    Ryanair has already confirmed an order of 100 Boeing 737-800 Next Generation aircraft with an option for a 
further 50.
 Earlier this month Ryanair took delivery of the first two planes of this order, taking its fleet size up to 50 aircraft -- 
29 Boeing 737-800s and 21 Boeing 737-200s.
    The remainder of the new planes are due for delivery over the next eight years.
    The speculation is that Ryanair will announce it plans to exercise its option.
    Yesterday, the airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary said the group is now planning for growth in passenger 
numbers of 30-35 pct a year for the two years to March 2005, rather than the 25 pct previously indicated.
    At 12.26 pm, Ryanair shares were up 21-1/2 pence at 419.
