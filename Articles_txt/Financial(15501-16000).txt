Ryanair is considering forcing 500 pilots to change their holiday plans to avoid risking additional flight delays, Chief 
Executive Michael O'Leary said on Thursday.
Ryanair this week offered pilots a bonus to work 10 additional days to alleviate a pilot shortage that has caused the 
cancellation of over 2,000 flights in September and October, hitting the airline's share price and reputation.
O'Leary told Ryanair's annual general meeting that it did not have sufficient spare pilots for September, October 
and November to ensure smooth operations and was considering forcing some pilots to change their annual leave 
plans. (Reuters)

BALPA has declared its willingness to help Ryanair improve working conditions in order to facilitate recruitment and 
retention of pilots, after a lack of available flightcrew led to the budget carrier's cancellation of 2,100 flights over the 
next six weeks.
The UK union is urging the airline to "do more to encourage pilots to stay with the airline, following news of its pilot 
holiday chaos" and to foster a "more attractive place for people to build their career".
In the union's statement, BALPA general secretary Brian Strutton suggests that "it seems Ryanair has been just 
about scraping through the summer schedule" and that "having no flexibility in the system – coupled with a 
miscalculation of pilot annual leave – has led to this disastrous situation."
He adds: "We believe these working conditions are leading to pilots leaving the airline after a few years to go work 
for other airlines."
Strutton states that BALPA has 500 unemployed pilots on its books who would be "more than happy to work for 
Ryanair, should working conditions be improved in the airline".
Ryanair says: "We don't comment on rumour or speculation, especially when it originates from competitor pilot 
unions."

Airline,Äôs chief executive, Michael O,ÄôLeary, apologizes as it says it will cancel 40 to 50 flights every day until 31 
October.¬Ryanair¬has written to 400,000 passengers to tell them that their flight has been canceled after it 
admitted to a ,Äúmess-up,Äù on pilot rostering that left 18 million ticket holders wondering if their holiday plans 
would be ruined.
In a hastily arranged press conference in Dublin on Monday afternoon amid a passenger revolt and a slump in the 
company,Äôs 
share 
price, 
the 
normally 
combative 
chief 
executive 
Michael 
O,ÄôLeary 
apologized 
,Äúunreservedly,Äù for ,Äúa mess of our own making,Äù.
O,ÄôLeary blamed a one-off holiday pilot rostering issue, which if not tackled immediately would send the 
airline,Äôs on-time punctuality below 50%, adding that it will cost Ryanair about ,Ç¨25m in compensation payouts 
and other costs.¬But in a flash of the arrogance for which he is better known, O,ÄôLeary said that travelers vowing 
Ryanair cancels many flights after roster failure
never to fly Ryanair again will almost certainly return to the airline because its prices are lower. ,ÄúOur booking 
engine is full of passengers who have sworn they will never fly with us again,,Äù he said.
Ryanair¬will cancel 40 to 50 flights every day until 31 October, with the airline promising to focus the cuts on routes 
where alternative flights are more easily available. For example, it will cancel one flight a day on its Stansted to 
Dublin route, which operates 12 a day. O,ÄôLeary said that 75% to 80% of passengers will be re-routed free of 
charge within a day of their expected departure date and that compensation of ,Ç¨240 to ,Ç¨400 will be paid, 
depending on the length of the journey. But that will leave as many as 100,000 ticket holders seriously delayed, with 
possible weekend getaways wrecked.
He admitted the way Ryanair issued its first cancellation warning on Friday had unnecessarily left millions of 
travelers in the dark. ,ÄúWe did not focus on the concern we were causing to the 18 million passengers flying with 
us over the next six weeks,,Äù O,ÄôLeary said. ,ÄúI say sorry to them.,Äù
Ryanair rejected allegations that the real reason for the cancellations is a shortage of pilots.
There have been claims that Ryanair has been hemorrhaging pilots to rival airlines. Norwegian, which is building a 
new hub in Ryanair,Äôs home airport, Dublin, said: ,ÄúWe can confirm that 140 pilots have joined Norwegian from 
Ryanair this year. Pilot recruitment is also underway for more pilots for our new Dublin base opening later this 
year.,Äù
O,ÄôLeary disputed Norwegian,Äôs figures but admitted that Ryanair has begun offering pilots at captain level a 
,Ç¨10,000 ,Äúsigning-on bonus,Äù to join. He also struggled to explain why Ryanair was not aware earlier of 
rostering problems ahead. ,ÄúThere were some overoptimistic briefings coming from rostering,,Äù he said.
He rejected any suggestion he should resign. ,ÄúThis is clearly a mess-up,,Äù he admitted. ,ÄúBut it is my mess-
up, and a mess I have to clear up.,Äù

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. shares were little changed in choppy trade on Wednesday 
as the pound surged against both the dollar and euro after official data showed U.K. retail sales increased at a 
faster pace in August.  Retail sales volume including auto fuel advanced 1 percent from July, the biggest growth in 
four months and up from July's increase of 0.6 percent.  On the flip side, British employers' confidence in the 
economy fell to the lowest level since Brexit, the latest JobsOutlook survey by the Recruitment & Employment 
Confederation showed. 
 A net balance of -7 said the economic conditions are getting worse in September versus -3 in August.  Investors 
await the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision due later in the day, with many expecting no change in 
interest rates.   That said, the accompanying statement may offer the details of how the central bank plans to start 
shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.  The benchmark FTSE 100 was virtually unchanged at 7,275 in late opening 
deals after gaining 0.3 percent the previous day.  Cairn Energy fell almost 2 percent after issuing a procedural 
update on its dispute with the Government of India under the UK India Bilateral Investment Treaty.  Mining giant 
BHP Billiton edged down slightly after it decided to hold its CEO base pay steady this fiscal year.  Ryanair Holdings 
shares declined 1 percent on reports that the discount airline has offered its pilots a one-off bonus of up to 12,000 
euros in a bid to avoid the damage caused by flight cancellation through the end of October.  Diageo lost 2 percent 
after the drinks giant warned its first-half organic net sales growth rate will be impacted by the later timing of 
Chinese New Year and by the expected impact of the highway ban in India.   Home improvement retailer Kingfisher 
jumped 6 percent after its first-half profit beat forecasts.

Ryanair has disclosed that 315,000 of its passengers have been impacted by its decision to cancel 2,100 of its 
flights over the next six weeks.
The customers have now been contacted with offers of alternative flights or refunds, says the budget carrier.
Ryanair had previously estimated the number of passengers affected by the cancellations would reach 390,000, but 
has now reduced that figure because "forward bookings in September were 90% but October were 70%".
The airline expects that by close of business today, it will have reaccommodated more than 175,000 passengers on 
alternative flights and given refunds to another 63,000.
It expects 300,000 impacted passengers, or 95% of the total, to have been booked on alternative routings or given 
refunds by 24 September.
"We have taken on extra customer service teams to speed up the rate at which we accommodate and action 
alternative flight requests or refund applications," states Ryanair's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs. "We 
expect to have the vast majority of these completed by the end of this week."
The Dublin-based carrier has been forced to cancel 40-50 flights per day until the end of the summer season in late 
October because of a squeeze on crew availability over the next six weeks.

Ryanair is still operating with about half the number of standby pilots it would normally rely on for its 2,000 flights a 
day, despite taking its abrupt decision to cancel flights for up to 400,000 passengers over the next six weeks.
Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, told the Financial Times yesterday that the number of pilots on 
standby had fallen to 20-30 a day in early September, compared with its typical cover of 200. Its move to cancel up 
to 2,100 flights over the next six weeks has seen the number of standby pilots rise to more than 100 a day.
"The problem was the first week in September it looked like we were running with standby coverage of 20-30 pilots 
a day and that wasn't enough," said Mr O'Leary. "The weekend before last we were cancelling flights, we were 
running out of duty hours, we were taking big flight delays ... that's why we said we wouldn't go through a second 
weekend like that."
Mr O'Leary was forced to apologise on Monday after passengers around Europe vented their fury on social media 
over the decision to cancel 50 flights a day starting on Saturday and running through October.
Ryanair's chief executive blamed its rostering system for failing to warn the airline that it did not have enough pilots 
on standby if there were unexpected problems, such as air traffic control strikes or bad weather. He said the airline 
was working out what the minimum number of standby pilots should be. It is also in the process of buying back 
leave from pilots.
Ryanair battles to solve staffing problems Airlines
Mr O'Leary admitted the budget carrier mishandled the announcement. "By not having the actual list of 
cancellations on Friday we managed to upset/ worry about 80m passengers flying with us over the next six weeks. 
We caused a storm of worry and concern. Apart from the rostering ... that's where we did really mess up," he said.
The airline said the disruption had been caused by its shift to counting pilot and crew flying hours during a calendar 
year, instead of from April to March. This meant it had a backlog of staff leave to be taken over the next few 
months, which caused it to have too few pilots on standby over the next six weeks.
Mr O'Leary denied that Ryanair had an overall shortage of pilots, noting it had increased pilot numbers over the 
past year to more than 4,200 and had a waiting list of about 2,500.
Ryanair expects a bill of up to (EURO)25m from the cancellations. It said on Monday it faced (EURO)20m in 
compensation payments and a (EURO)5m hit to profits, but insisted it would be a one-off cost.
Analysts said the abruptness of the decision revealed both the tightness of crew scheduling at Ryanair, running 
close to the regulated limits of pilot flying time, and what appeared to be a poor system for managing flight 
disruptions.
"I think we have to learn and we have to have a better early heads-up warning system," said Mr O'Leary.

AS RYANAIR- and its passengers - begin to count the cost of its decision to cancel 40 to 50 flights every day for the 
next six weeks, YouGov BrandIndex data suggest that the saga is already denting the airline's long-term efforts to 
improve its public perception.
The brand blames poor planning of pilots' holidays for the disruption, though other reports suggest recruitment 
issues are also a problem. Over the last four years, our brand tracking data shows the airline began to change its 
image - from a muchmaligned budget option with an unconventional PR strategy, to a carrier challenging the 
established industry leaders.
Our data shows between June 2014 and June 2017 Ryanair's impression score rose by 20 points from minus 48 to 
minus 28 following changes implemented by boss Michael O'Leary. Across the same period its quality score moved 
from minus 50 to minus 34.
This trend is further reflected in Ryanair's purchase consideration score that grew by eight points in the three years 
to the end of June.
However, the impact of the airline's cancelled flights is already showing in our data. Given the widespread coverage 
given to the story, it is not a surprise that its buzz score (whether someone has heard something good or bad about 
the brand in the past two weeks) has declined notably.
But BrandIndex data shows that other metrics have also suffered. Ryanair's impression score fell by three points in 
three days following the announcement and is now at its lowest level this year and its recommend score has also 
declined notably. It should be noted, however, that purchase consideration of the airline remains relatively high.
Ryanair's reputation may be grounded by cancellations
Back in May, I reflected on the damage British Airways' reputation suffered after its IT failure. Then, the brand's 
impression score fell by 32 points in three weeks and four months later its score is yet to make up all of this lost 
ground.
However, BA has pretty positive public perception before the IT issues whereas Ryanair - though improving over a 
long period - was still in negative territory. The carrier has always managed to shrug off adverse headlines but this 
seems to be its toughest challenge yet.

THE FINANCIAL hit from Ryanair's flight cancellation chaos could be greater than the (EURO)25m (£18.5m) 
forecast, experts have said.
The Irish carrier said over the weekend it will have to cancel 40-50 flights every day for the next six weeks, after 
messing up the planning of pilots' holidays. It said on Monday it faced a (EURO)25m bill for the troubles, but 
analysts think it could be higher.
Goodbody Stockbrokers estimated its "around (EURO)53m". The airline has offered affected passengers alternative 
flights or a full refund and compensation.

UK Conservatives At Odds Over How To Leave EU Ahead Of May's Speech
UK Conservatives At Odds Over How To Leave EU Ahead Of May's Speech

 Ahead of a much-anticipated speech on Brexit by a weakened British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, 
differences among Conservative colleagues continue to hamper her efforts to negotiate the terms of leaving the 
European Union, analysts say.
Michael O'Leary, the outspoken pro-EU chief executive of Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, recently joined 
a growing number of critics who feel May's Brexit negotiations are "going nowhere".
"They are a bit of a shambles, and they need a bit of leadership," O'Leary told Sky News.
Ahead of May's much-anticipated Brexit speech in Florence on Friday, speculation is mounting over whether the 
under-pressure prime minister or a rival inside her Conservative party could try to provide that leadership.
In what many analysts see as the latest sign of division, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - a leadership contender 
before May won the race to replace David Cameron in July 2016 - set out his personal "vision for a bold, thriving 
Britain enabled by Brexit" in The Times on Saturday.
Johnson revived the controversial claim, first used by the Leave campaign he led into last year's Brexit referendum, 
that leaving the EU could save Britain more than GBP350 million per week to be spent on public services.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd accused Johnson of attempting to position himself as a "back-seat driver" of Brexit, 
while David Norgrove, head of the government's statistics office, wrote an open letter complaining that Johnson's 
weekly total of GBP350 million "confuses gross and net contributions" to the EU and was "a clear misuse of official 
statistics".
Johnson rejected Norgrove's criticism and said he was "looking forward" to May's speech in Florence.
"All behind Theresa for a glorious Brexit," he wrote on Twitter.
But Colin Talbot, a professor of government at Manchester and Cambridge universities, said it appears that 
Johnson "wants to position himself as Leader of the Hard Brexit Brigade for the leadership battle to come."
UK Conservatives At Odds Over How To Leave EU Ahead Of May's Speech
The Conservatives are in "almost open civil war," while their main rivals, Labour, are in "suppressed civil war," 
Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said on Monday.
"Boris is Boris," May told reporters travelling with her to Canada on Monday. "This government is driven from the 
front and we are all going to the same destination," she said.
"We are all agreed as a government about the importance of ensuring the right deal for Britain, the right withdrawal 
agreement but also the right deal on a special partnership between the EU and UK for the future."
Despite her recent insistence that she is "not a quitter" and will lead the Conservatives into another general election 
in 2022, Simon Usherwood, a Brexit-focussed political analyst at the University of Surrey, said she remains "a dead 
woman walking."
That has been the view of many observers since May called a disastrous snap election in June.
She surprisingly lost her parliamentary majority in the election, amid a surge in support for left-wing Labour leader 
Jeremy Corbyn, forcing her to rely on backing from 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist 
Party in key votes.
"She's fatally compromised herself with the party, and the party is not a sympathetic organization," Usherwood told 
dpa.
It would take a "pretty astounding turnaround" for May to remain the long-term leader, he said.
"I think at this point it's convenient to keep her in [office], because if things are looking bad she may as well take the 
blame, and then the new person comes in and cleans up and gets a bounce off that," Usherwood said.
UK Chancellor Philip Hammond, who has promoted a "pro-business" Brexit with strong transitional arrangements to 
protect the economy after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, and Liam Fox, a pro-Brexit trade minister who 
argues that Britain could survive leaving the EU with no deal, wrote a joint article last month that was seen as a 
show of unity by the Conservatives.
Britain will definitely leave the EU customs union and single market but could agree a "time-limited" transition to 
"give business greater certainty," Hammond and Fox wrote in The Telegraph.
But Usherwood said their intervention failed to hide the cracks in party unity.
"You're still getting the different views coming through from individuals," he said.
"They might have patched things over for that [article] but there's still lots that they don't agree on."
Usherwood said he saw "no consensus view in cabinet or in senior levels of the Tory party."
"So it's the same problem that there's been all the way since last June: There's no plan; and even if there were a 
plan, there's nobody who's got a clear ability to make it happen."

Ryanair CEO takes rap for costly cancellations "cock up"
Ryanair CEO takes rap for costly cancellations "cock up"

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary admitted on Monday to a "cock up" over pilot shortages that led him to cancel flights 
and disrupt the plans of hundreds of thousands of travelers in his bid to improve the budget airline's punctuality.
The Irish airline said it was preparing for up to 20 million euros in compensation claims and 5 million euros in lost 
fares as a result of the cancellations, although analysts estimated the total cost could be higher.
"This is clearly a mess up, I take responsibility for the mess up and I have to clear it up. I say sorry on behalf of 
Ryanair. I say we want to put our hands up, which is what we do when we make a mess," O'Leary told a news 
conference.
Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers blamed a number of factors for the sudden cancellations including a 
backlog of staff leave, which must be taken by the end of the year, air traffic control strikes and bad weather.
O'Leary promised the problem would not recur in 2018 but said there would be a reputational hit from canceling 
flights to and from destinations including Barcelona, Brussels, Lisbon, Madrid, Milan and Rome, which would not 
help future bookings.
Norwegian Air said it had hired more than 140 Ryanair pilots this year, although O'Leary said it had lost less than 
100 of its 4,200 pilots and had recruited some from its rival, meaning it could fully crew its peak schedule.
The move brought bad publicity for an airline which has worked hard over the past few years to improve a 
reputation for treating passengers badly.
Ryanair CEO takes rap for costly cancellations "cock up"
"Have I damaged Ryanair's reputation with these cancellations? Yes but I would rather damage the reputation of 
Ryanair by canceling 2% of our flights than significantly delaying 40% of our flights," O'Leary said.
Seeking to halt a decline in performance figures, Ryanair has taken the unusual step of announcing plans to cancel 
between 40 and 50 flights per day until the end of October "to improve its system-wide punctuality which has fallen 
below 80 percent in the first two weeks of September." This fell as low as 70% in the days before the drastic move 
to cancel flights.
While it currently calculates crew leave from April to March, the Irish Aviation Authority is forcing it to calculate it 
from January to December from the start of 2018.
O'Leary said the problems were "because we're giving pilots lots of holidays over the next four months." Every 
passenger who is entitled to compensation will receive it in full, he added.
Ryanair sent emails to the first affected passengers last Friday, giving them the choice of a refund or an alternative 
flight. It has issued cancellation notices up until Wednesday.
News bulletins in Ireland ran interviews with disgruntled customers while newspapers asked readers to share their 
stories, including a wedding party who told the Irish Times they had been left stranded in France.
Analysts at Dublin-based Goodbody Stockbrokers estimated the cancellations would cost the airline about 34.5 
million euros  -- comprising 23.5 million euros in compensation, 6.3 million euros in lost fees, and 4.7 million euros 
in subsistence such as meals, drinks and accommodation.
Goodbody said that would shave 2.3% off its full-year forecast of 1.479 billion euros in profit after tax.
In July, Ryanair reiterated its 1.4 billion to 1.45 billion euro forecast for the financial year ending March 31, 2018.
Barring exceptional circumstances, airlines must under EU rules provide at least two weeks' notice to avoid paying 
compensation of 250 euros per passenger for flights of 1,500 km or less or 400 euros for longer flights within the 
bloc.
The fall in Ryanair's punctuality below 80% compared to an average of 89% in the three months to the end of June. 
O'Leary said at the time he was not happy with that figure, seeking a mark of over 90%.
O'Leary confirmed a report in the Irish Independent that Ryanair had been offering some pilots a 10,000 euro 
"signing-on bonus" to keep up with its rapid passenger growth.
Training company CAE Inc has warned the worldwide commercial aviation industry would need an extra 255,000 
pilots by 2027 to sustain its rapid growth and was not moving fast enough to fill the positions.
Shares in Ryanair, which fell by more than 3% in early trading, were 1.85% lower at 1430 GMT. (Reuters)

       By Bill Smith, dpa   Ahead of a much-anticipated speech on Brexit by a weakened British Prime Minister 
Theresa May on Friday, differences among Conservative colleagues continue to hamper her efforts to negotiate the 
terms of leaving the European Union, analysts say.  LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Michael O'Leary, the outspoken pro-EU 
chief executive of budget airline Ryanair, recently joined a growing number of critics who feel Prime Minister 
Theresa May's Brexit negotiations are 'going nowhere.'  'They are a bit of a shambles, and they need a bit of 
leadership,' O'Leary told Sky News.  Ahead of May's much-anticipated Brexit speech in Florence on Friday, 
speculation is mounting over whether the under-pressure prime minister or a rival inside her Conservative party 
could try to provide that leadership. 
 In what many analysts see as the latest sign of division, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - a leadership contender 
before May won the race to replace David Cameron in July 2016 - set out his personal 'vision for a bold, thriving 
Britain enabled by Brexit' in The Times on Saturday.   Johnson revived the controversial claim, first used by the 
Leave campaign he led into last year's Brexit referendum, that leaving the European Union could save Britain more 
than 350 million pounds (455 million dollars) per week to be spent on public services.  Home Secretary Amber 
Rudd accused Johnson of attempting to position himself as a 'back-seat driver' of Brexit, while David Norgrove, 
head of the government's statistics office, wrote an open letter complaining that Johnson's weekly total of 350 
million pounds 'confuses gross and net contributions' to the EU and was 'a clear misuse of official statistics.'  
Johnson rejected Norgrove's criticism and said he was 'looking forward' to May's speech in Florence.  'All behind 
Theresa for a glorious Brexit,' he wrote on Twitter.  But Colin Talbot, a professor of government at Manchester and 
Cambridge universities, said it appears that Johnson 'wants to position himself as Leader of the Hard Brexit Brigade 
for the leadership battle to come.'  The Conservatives are in 'almost open civil war,' while their main rivals, Labour, 
are in 'suppressed civil war,' Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said on Monday.  'Boris is Boris,' May told 
reporters travelling with her to Canada on Monday. 'This government is driven from the front and we are all going to 
the same destination,' she said.   'We are all agreed as a government about the importance of ensuring the right 
deal for Britain, the right withdrawal agreement but also the right deal on a special partnership between the EU and 
UK for the future.'  Despite her recent insistence that she is 'not a quitter' and will lead the Conservatives into 
another general election in 2022, Simon Usherwood, a Brexit-focussed political analyst at the University of Surrey, 
Brexit means Brexit? Conservatives at odds over how to leave EU
said she remains 'a dead woman walking.'  That has been the view of many observers since May called a 
disastrous snap election in June.  She surprisingly lost her parliamentary majority in the election, amid a surge in 
support for left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, forcing her to rely on backing from 10 lawmakers from Northern 
Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party in key votes.  'She's fatally compromised herself with the party, and the party is 
not a sympathetic organization,' Usherwood told dpa.  It would take a 'pretty astounding turnaround' for May to 
remain the long-term leader, he said.  'I think at this point it's convenient to keep her in [office], because if things are 
looking bad she may as well take the blame, and then the new person comes in and cleans up and gets a bounce 
off that,' Usherwood said.  Chancellor Philip Hammond, who has promoted a 'pro-business' Brexit with strong 
transitional arrangements to protect the economy after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, and Liam Fox, a pro-
Brexit trade minister who argues that Britain could survive leaving the EU with no deal, wrote a joint article last 
month that was seen as a show of unity by the Conservatives.  Britain will definitely leave the EU customs union 
and single market but could agree a 'time-limited' transition to 'give business greater certainty,' Hammond and Fox 
wrote in The Telegraph.  But Usherwood said their intervention failed to hide the cracks in party unity.  'You're still 
getting the different views coming through from individuals,' he said.  'They might have patched things over for that 
[article] but there's still lots that they don't agree on.'  Usherwood said he saw 'no consensus view in cabinet or in 
senior levels of the Tory party.'  'So it's the same problem that there's been all the way since last June: There's no 
plan; and even if there were a plan, there's nobody who's got a clear ability to make it happen.'   Copyright dpa

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, has long talked about his desire to make the group the "Amazon of air

As part of its "Always Getting Better" campaign, Ryanair has spent the past few years pouring significant resources 
into upgrading its website and app to make the brand more appealing.
Over the past 18 months, this has seen the airline expand into travel services, such as Ryanair rooms (hotels) and 
Ryanair holidays.
The group has previously stated an ambition to grow ancillary sales from 20 per cent to 30 per cent of revenues 
over the four years to March 2020. It has already grown them to 27 per cent.
Kenny Jacobs, chief marketing officer at Ryanair, says it will continue to focus on the "bread and butter" services as 
well as some of the more "sexy" products.
He notes the introduction of products such as its plus fares, which saw the airline launch bundled fares aimed at 
segments such as business travellers and families, have growth potential.
"It may be the less sexy stuff but they are the ones that have the bigger financial impact," he notes. "We can look at 
the sexy things but they don't necessarily convert as well as the bread-and-butter services."

Break-up speculation put GKN among the gainers yesterday with the FTSE 100 bouncing off a four-month low as 
the pound retreated.
GKN climbed 2.7 per cent to 347.6p on a revival of talk that it might spin off its automotive division to a buyer such 
as SAIC Motor Corporation. China's largest carmaker was rumoured last year to have approached GKN with an 
offer of about 450p per share. "It is unlikely that either the UK or US government would permit GKN Aerospace to 
fall into Chinese hands," said Exane. "We therefore consider that any move by the Chinese will be limited to GKN's 
automotive assets. Such a disposal would be well timed from an auto endmarket perspective, while the Chinese 
would gain tier-one supplier access to global auto OEMs [original equipment manufacturers]."
GKN last week named the head of its aerospace division as its chief executiveelect, which analysts have read as a 
signal of the group's future shape. GKN's £300m bond issue in May has also helped the case for a break-up by 
reducing its pension deficit, Exane said.
A reversal for sterling and a positive start on Wall Street underpinned the wider market. The FTSE 100 edged 0.5 
per cent higher, up 37.81 points to 7,253.28. Aerospace and defence stocks rallied as Northrop Grumman's $7.8bn 
deal to buy Orbital helped spur consolidation hopes. Meggitt climbed to 500p and Cobham rose to 137.5p. BAE 
Systems led the blue-chip risers, up 3.9 per cent to 619.5p, on the news that Qatar is buying 24 Eurofighter 
Typhoon jets.
GKN climbs on talk that automotive division will be put up for sale; London
Instrumentation maker Rotork was higher at 251p on a UBS upgrade to "buy". UBS said analysis of Rotork's cost 
base suggests "significant opportunities" to lift operating margin back towards the previous level of 25 per cent 
within five years, yet the market "is pricing in no significant margin upside based on consensus revenue forecasts".
Esure climbed to 278.5p after the Sunday Times reported that Sir Peter Wood, the car insurer's chairman and 30.8 
per cent shareholder, has been sounding out potential buyers of his stake. Sector peers Direct Line and Hastings 
were said in July to have been approached by Esure's advisers, but according to reports the discussions have since 
moved on to potential buyers in the US. Esure said it did not comment on "rumour or speculation".
Admiral gained 2.2 per cent to £18.24 after Deutsche Bank took the stock off its "sell" list, largely on valuation 
grounds.
Ryanair fell 2.4 per cent to (EURO)16.73 after staff shortages forced the airline to cancel up to 2,100 flights. "It is 
the potential for long-term damage that concerns us," said RBC. "History has not been kind to low-cost carriers that 
cannot deliver."

Ryanair faces a bill of up to (EURO)25m after the abrupt decision to cancel up to 2,100 flights over the next six 
weeks, a move it was forced to make to abide by safety rules for pilot flying time.
Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, apologised yesterday after passengers around Europe vented their 
fury on social media over the decision to cancel 50 flights a day starting on Saturday and running through October. 
"We apologise unreservedly to those customers whose travel will be disrupted," said Mr O'Leary, scrambling to limit 
the reputational damage the airline has faced since announcing the cancellations on Friday. "This is a mess of our 
own making."
Some passengers were left unconvinced.
Stephen Smith, who discovered that his Saturday morning flight from Alicante to Manchester had been cancelled 
only when his wife's boarding pass was rejected by security, said there had been little effort to help stranded 
passengers. "I was gobsmacked a company could have such disdain for customers with no alternatives, no help or 
support," Mr Smith said.
It remained unclear why the carrier had been unable to give advance notice of the cancellations at the weekend. It 
only published a list of flights affected late on Monday afternoon.
The disruption has been caused, at least in part, by Ryanair's shift to counting pilot and crew flying hours during a 
calendar year, instead of from April to March. Mr O'Leary insisted the carrier was not short of pilots.

"We were able to fully crew our peak summer schedule in June, July and August, but we have messed up the 
allocation of annual leave to pilots in September and October," he said. "This issue will not recur in 2018."
The European Commission weighed in yesterday, reminding Ryanair it had to comply with EU rules on passenger 
rights, including possible reimbursement and compensation. Ryanair told analysts it faced (EURO)20m in 
compensation payments and a (EURO)5m hit to profits.
Analysts said the decision's suddenness revealed both the tightness of Ryanair's crew scheduling, running close to 
the regulated limits of pilot flying time, and also what appeared to be a poor system for managing flight disruptions. 
Ryanair's share price dropped 1.76 per cent yesterday.

RYANAIR is set to foot a (EURO)25m (£22m) bill following a wave of flight cancellations set to take place over the 
next six weeks.
The airline said over the weekend that it will cancel 40 to 50 flights every day until the end of October after 
"messing up" its pilots' holidays, the fallout from which could affect nearly 400,000 passengers.
The Irish carrier said it could face compensation claims of up to (EURO)20m and lose (EURO)5m worth of fares.
However, Goodbody Stockbrokers predicts the flight cancellations could cost Ryanair nearly (EURO)34.5m.
London-listed shares in the airline dropped three per cent in early trading yesterday, but recovered slightly to end 
the day down 2.39 per cent at (EURO)16.73.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said the development was "a mess of our own making".
"While over 98 per cent of our customers will not be affected by these cancellations over the next six weeks, we 
apologise unreservedly to those customers whose travel will be disrupted," he said.
O'Leary (pictured) also rebuffed suggestions a lack of pilots had contributed to the problem. It emerged yesterday 
that low-cost rival Norwegian has been recruiting dozens of Ryanair pilots over 2017, with the airline confirming 
yesterday "140 pilots have joined us from Ryanair this year".
O'Leary stressed yesterday: "Ryanair is not short of pilots - we were able to fully crew our peak summer schedule in 
June, July and August - but we have messed up the allocation of annual leave to pilots in September and October 
PILOT ERROR: RYANAIR HIT BY FALLOUT
because we are trying to allocate a full year's leave into a nine-month period from April to December". Ryanair last 
night published a full list of the cancellations on its website.
The European Commission also waded into the discussion yesterday, saying that the budget airline will have to 
comply with European Union rules on passenger rights.
A spokesperson said: "We have to check if all this is respected by Ryanair. For instance, you are entitled to 
reimbursement if you are not warned two weeks in advance."
Questions have also been raised over why Ryanair did not follow in the footsteps of British Airways in leasing 
aircraft and crew. Earlier this year, BA struck an agreement with Qatar Airways to cover strike action by mixed fleet 
cabin crew in a row over pay.
Aviation expert Julian Bray branded Ryanair's cancellations a "major operational disaster".
"I fail to see why Ryanair have not immediately wet-leased aircraft and crews from other airlines to cover the flights 
they have cancelled," he said.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) and Norwegian Air Shuttle have halted talks on a flight connection agreement, both 
companies confirmed on Monday, according to a report from Reuters. 
Norwegian Air confirmed Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's statement that talks on an agreement had ended. 
Earlier on Monday, Ryanair and Norwegian Air disagreed publicly over the number of staff each was poaching from 
the other.
O'Leary earlier admitted to a "cock-up" over rostering that led the carrier to cancel flights and disrupt travel plans of 
hundreds of thousands of travelers, wiping out 2% from Ryanair's share price on Monday.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. shares edged higher on Tuesday as the pound pulled back 
from a 15-month high against the dollar, helping spur bargain hunting in shares of multinational companies on the 
benchmark index.   Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Monday  that 'some withdrawal of monetary 
stimulus' would be necessary to bring U.K. inflation back to the 2 percent goal, but any rate rise would be 'gradual' 
and 'limited'.  The benchmark FTSE 100 was up 15 points or 0.20 percent at 7,268 in late opening deals after rising 
half a percent the previous day.  Royal Bank of Scotland edged up marginally after European Union regulators 
approved a British plan that ends the bank's state aid commitments.  Budget airline Ryanair jumped as much as 3 
percent after halting talks on a flight connection agreement with Norwegian Air Shuttle.  Ocado Group shares 
slumped 4.3 percent. The online grocery delivery company reported higher sales in its third quarter, but signaled a 
further hit to earnings from costs of setting up new distribution centers.

LONDON (AP) - Irish budget airline Ryanair was under pressure Monday to provide more information to travelers 
after canceling up to 50 flights a day over the next six weeks because it mismanaged its pilots' holiday schedules.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers, canceled the flights because it had "messed up in the 
planning of pilot holidays."
The company promised to publish a full list of the canceled flights by Tuesday, but as of Monday there were only 
details on canceled flights through Wednesday.
Travelers with flights after Wednesday remained in limbo and took to social media to vent their anger.
"How the hell do you know if you can get back. Publish full list now!" Carole Schofield tweeted.
The company offered to refund travelers for their canceled flights, in accordance with EU law, or to allow them to 
change their flight for free. It also faces paying compensation of 250 euros ($300) per traveler for flights canceled 
on less than two weeks' notice.
CEO Michael O'Leary said Monday that the cost of compensation will run up to 20 million euros ($24 million).
"Clearly there's a large reputational impact for which again I apologize. We will try to do better in future," he said.
Shares in the airline fell 1.8 percent to 16.77 euros in Dublin in an otherwise higher market.
Analysts said Ryanair's scheduling problems stemmed from having to harmonize Irish rules with European Union 
rules on how many hours pilots can fly in a certain period of time.
"The impact in terms of adverse publicity and frustration to customers is large," said Loizos Heracleous, professor 
of strategy at the Warwick Business School. He does not, however, expect it to have a durable financial impact on 
the company, which is expanding and is adept at controlling costs and finding new sources of revenue.

The European Commission on Monday warned low-cost airline Ryanair to comply with EU laws on passengers' 
rights after the operator announced that it would cancel more than 2,000 flights until the end of October.
Ryanair said on Friday that it would cancel 40 to 50 flights each day in the coming six weeks to accommodate for a 
backlog of holidays for its crew - noting that the cancellations were meant to "improve [the company's] system-wide 
punctuality."
"It is not for commission to comment on the operational decisions by airlines, but we expect Ryanair to comply with 
the European rules on passengers' rights," said Enrico Brivio, a spokesman for the commission.
Under EU laws passed in 2004, airlines have to notify passengers of cancellations at least two weeks in advance. If 
the cancelled flight is within two weeks, the airline needs to offer to re-route travellers on planes that depart within 
up to two hours from the originally scheduled flights.
If the airline fails to do this, passengers are entitled for compensation.
The European Commission noted that it was up to national authorities to enforce the EU regulation.

Ryanair on Friday announced plans to cancel between 40 and 50 flights per day until the end of October, disrupting 
hundreds of thousands of journeys, in what it said was a bid to improve its ratio of on-time flights.
The cancellations, which begin immediately, are designed "to improve its system-wide punctuality which has fallen 
below 80% in the first two weeks of September," Ryanair said in a statement, describing the number of delayed 
flights as "unacceptable" to customers.
If the airline cancels 40 flights per day for six weeks at a load factor of 90%, approximately 285,000 journeys would 
be affected.
The Dublin-listed budget airline next week celebrates the fourth anniversary of its Always Getting Better campaign, 
which Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has described as an effort to stop "unnecessarily pissing people off."
Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers sent emails to the first affected passengers on Friday, giving them 
the choice of a refund or an alternative flight.
The airline said it would waive a 40 euro surcharge normally levied to change flights.
A Reuters reporter, whose flight from Dublin to Barcelona on Sept. 18 was canceled on Friday, was offered a 
choice of a surcharge of 250 euros to take an earlier flight on Sept. 18 or 60 euros to take a flight on Sept. 19.
Ryanair said its on-time ratio in recent weeks had been impacted by air traffic control strikes and weather 
disruptions. It also said it was trying to deal with a backlog of crew leave, which must be allocated before the end of 
the year.

Ryanair is preparing for up to 20 million euros in compensation claims after canceling thousands of flights due to a 
shortage of staff, a spokeswoman for the Irish budget airline said on Monday.
Ryanair admitted on Monday it had messed up after it disrupted plans of hundreds of thousands of travelers by 
canceling flights to cope with pilot shortages and improve its punctuality record. 
Ryanair blamed a number of factors for the sudden cancellations including a backlog of staff leave, which must be 
taken by the end of the year. Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers also said air traffic control strikes and 
weather disruption were affecting its performance.
Rival Norwegian Air said on Monday that it had recruited more than 140 pilots from Ryanair this year, adding to the 
squeeze on staffing.
"It is clearly a mess but in the context of an operation where we operate more than 2,500 flights every day, it is 
reasonably small but that doesn't take away the inconvenience we've caused to people," Ryanair Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary told Sky News.
He said the problems were not the result of pilots quitting but was "because we're giving pilots lots of holidays over 
the next four months." Every passenger who is entitled to compensation will receive it in full, he added.
Seeking to halt a decline in performance figures, Ryanair has taken the unusual step of announcing plans to cancel 
between 40 and 50 flights per day until the end of October.
Ryanair sees P20m in compensation claims for canceling flights
Ryanair said the cancellations were designed "to improve its system-wide punctuality which has fallen below 80 
percent in the first two weeks of September."
While it currently calculates crew leave from April to March, the Irish Aviation Authority is forcing it to calculate it 
from January to December from the start of 2018, it added.
Ryanair sent emails to the first affected passengers last Friday, giving them the choice of a refund or an alternative 
flight. It has issued cancellation notices up until Wednesday.
The move brought bad publicity for an airline which has worked hard over the past few years to improve a 
reputation for treating passengers badly.
News bulletins in Ireland ran interviews with disgruntled customers while newspapers asked readers to share their 
stories, including a wedding party who told the Irish Times they had been left stranded in France.
Analysts at Dublin-based Goodbody Stockbrokers estimated that the cancellations would cost the airline around 
34.5 million euros -- comprising 23.5 million euros in compensation, 6.3 million euros in lost fees, and 4.7 million 
euros in subsistence such as meals, drinks and accommodation.
Goodbody said that would shave 2.3% off its full year forecast of 1.479 billion euros in profit after tax.
In July, Ryanair reiterated its 1.4 to 1.45 billion euro forecast for the financial year ending March 31, 2018.
Barring exceptional circumstances, airlines must under EU rules provide at least two weeks' notice to avoid paying 
compensation of 250 euros per passenger for flights of 1,500 km or less or 400 euros for longer flights within the 
bloc.
The fall in Ryanair's punctuality below 80% compared to an average of 89% in the three months to the end of June. 
O'Leary said at the time he was not happy with that figure, seeking a mark of over 90%.
The Irish Independent reported on Monday that Ryanair has been offering pilots a 10,000 euro ($11,925) "signing-
on bonus" in response to recruitment problems.
Ryanair employed 4,058 pilots at the end of March, according to its annual report, up from 3,424 a year earlier to 
keep up with a rapid growth in passenger numbers.
Training company CAE Inc warned recently that the worldwide commercial aviation industry will need an extra 
255,000 pilots by 2027 to sustain its rapid growth and is not moving fast enough to fill the positions.
Shares in Ryanair, which fell by more than 3% in early trading, were 1.9% lower at 1315 GMT. (Reuters)

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) announced that it would cancel 40-50 flights daily 
for the next six weeks, till the end of October, aiming to improve its system-wide punctuality. The company's on-
time performance has declined to under 80% from 90% over the past two weeks. In London, Ryanair shares were 
trading down around 3 percent in the early morning trading. 
 Ryanair's traffic levels during the peak summer months of July and August were significant. But, the punctuality 
has fallen through a combination of ATC capacity delays and strikes, weather disruptions and the impact of 
increased holiday allocations to pilots and cabin crew.  The changes in holiday allocations reflects the airline's move 
to allocate annual leave during a 9 month transition period before December 31 as it plans to switch holiday year, 
currently April to March, to a calendar year from 1st January 2018 onwards.  According to the firm, these tighter 
crewing numbers and the impact of ATC capacity restrictions in the UK, Germany and Spain, as well as French 
ATC strikes and adverse weather with thunderstorms have given rise to significant delays in recent weeks.    By 
reducing its scheduled flying programme by less than 2% of its over 2,500 daily flights, the airline expects to create 
additional standby aircraft which will help restore on-time performance to its 90% average.  Ryanair said it 
apologizes sincerely for the inconvenience caused to customers by these cancellations. Customers will be 
contacted directly about this small number of cancellations and offered alternative flights or full refunds.  Ryanair's 
Robin Kiely said, 'We have operated a record schedule (and traffic numbers) during the peak summer months of 
July and August but must now allocate annual leave to pilots and cabin crew in September and October (while still 
running the bulk of our summer schedule).  ....By cancelling less than 2% of our flying programme over the next six 
weeks, (until our winter schedule starts in early November) we can improve the operational resilience of our 
schedules and restore punctuality to our annualised target of 90%.'  Ryanair shares were trading at 16.54 euros, 
down 2.8 percent.

Low-cost carrier Ryanair estimates its move to cancel around 50 flights a day over the next six weeks to ease 
problems stemming from a shortage of available crew could cost it up to 25 million ($21 million).
Chief executive Michael O'Leary outlined the financial impact during a press conference today, as the airline sought 
to explain its decision to begin cancelling flights. The carrier will cancel an average of 48 flights a day, and has now 
published the full list of flights, over the next six weeks.
"We have tried to over-allocate leave to pilots in September and October while running a busy summer schedule, 
and we don't have enough standby coverage to be able to cover the inevitable disruption that happen at this time of 
the year," explained O'Leary.
"For about the previous eight or nine days, our punctuality had fallen from something of an average of about 90% to 
under 70%," he says.
"We had two choices. We can either run the operation with a 55-60% punctuality rate, which will create far more 
flight disruptions and inevitable cancellations, and huge passenger dissatisfaction caused to 35% of our customer 
base, or take out about 50 flights for the next six weeks while we have this crewing issue, and thereby create 
additional standby pilots and aircraft, and get our punctuality back up to 90% and eliminate the risk over the next six 
weeks," he says.
The airline has taken out a line of flying out of nine of its busier airports, and two lines out of its biggest operation at 
London Stansted, on routes where it has multiple frequencies. "By taking out one of the lines of flying out of those 
busier bases we will have many more alternatives to communicate to passengers," explains O'Leary.
Flight cancellations could cost Ryanair 25 million E Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair estimates its move to cancel 
around 50 flights a day over the next six weeks....
"We will not be trying to claim exceptional circumstances," he adds, noting customers with cancelled flights will be 
eligible for compensation. "This is our mess up. When we make a mess-up at Ryanair, we come out with our hands 
up.
"In terms of its impact on the company, clearly there is a large reputational impact, for which I apologise and we will 
try to do better in future.
"In terms of lost profitability, we think it will cost us something of the order of up to 5 million over the next six seeks. 
And in terms of the EU261 [passenger] compensation we think it will cost a maximum of 20 million, but that will 
depend on how many of the alternate flights our customers take up over that period of time."

 Ryanair (RYAAY) American depository shares were lower about 2% in recent pre-market trade after the company 
said Friday that it will cancel 40-50 flights daily for the next six weeks to improve its system-wide punctuality, which 
fell below 80% in the first two weeks of September.  
The company said the decline in punctuality was the result of a combination of ATC capacity delays and strikes, 
weather disruptions and the impact of increased holiday allocations to pilots and cabin crew.
Ryanair said the cancelled flights represents less than 2% of its over 2,500 daily flights.

       BRUSSELS (dpa-AFX) - The European Commission on Monday warned low-cost airline Ryanair to comply with 
EU laws on passengers' rights after the operator announced that it would cancel more than 2,000 flights until the 
end of October.  Ryanair said on Friday that it would cancel 40 to 50 flights each day in the coming six weeks to 
accommodate for a backlog of holidays for its crew - noting that the cancellations were meant to 'improve [the 
company's] system-wide punctuality.'  'It is not for commission to comment on the operational decisions by airlines, 
but we expect Ryanair to comply with the European rules on passengers' rights,' said Enrico Brivio, a spokesman 
for the commission.  Under EU laws passed in 2004, airlines have to notify passengers of cancellations at least two 
weeks in advance. If the cancelled flight is within two weeks, the airline needs to offer to re-route travellers on 
planes that depart within up to two hours from the originally scheduled flights.  If the airline fails to do this, 
passengers are entitled for compensation.  The European Commission noted that it was up to national authorities to 
enforce the EU regulation.   Copyright dpa

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. shares rebounded on Monday as the pound's momentum 
slowed in the currency markets, helping offset downbeat housing data.   Investor sentiment was also buoyed by a 
rally in euro-area peripheral bonds after S&P Global Ratings raised Portugal's credit rating to investment grade with 
a stable outlook.  The benchmark FTSE 100 was up 20 points or 0.29 percent at 7,236 in late opening deals after 
falling as much as 1.1 percent in the previous session to hit a four-month low on worries over a rising pound and 
after an explosion on a Tube train at Parsons Green station.  BAE Systems jumped almost 3 percent on signing a 
deal to supply 24 Typhoon fighter jets to Qatar.  Dairy Crest Group shares rose over 1 percent. The dairy products 
firm said it expects profit for the half year to be ahead of the same period last year.  Ryanair lost 2.6 percent after 
the low-cost airline announced plans to cancel between 40 and 50 flights every day up until 20 September.

Budget airline Ryanair has listed dozens of flights which it is cancelling in order to cope with a strain on crew 
availability over the next six weeks.
The carrier admits that its punctuality statistics have suffered over the first half of September, dropping to less than 
80%.
While Ryanair attributes this partly to air traffic control capacity, weather-related disruption and industrial action, it 
acknowledges that a nine-month transition period in its crew leave allocation schedule is having a detrimental 
effect.
It expects to cancel around 40 or 50 flights each day until the end of the summer season in late October, amounting 
to some 2,000 services in total.
Ryanair says the crew leave change means it is having to deal with "increased holiday allocations" arising from the 
April-December transition interval, which has generated a "backlog" of leave.
The new leave schedule will coincide with the calendar year, rather than the April-March financial year.
Ryanair says the "tighter" crewing, as well as other adverse effects, have reduced its punctuality from 90% to an 
"unacceptable" 80% over the first two weeks of September. The changes will enable it to provide additional reserve 
aircraft to restore punctuality.
It stresses that the flight cancellations amount to less than 2% of its daily operations.

Sep 17, 2017( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A German 
airline issued warnings to its pilots after they allegedly filmed some stewardesses engaged in sexual acts on planes 
and circulated the videos around, reports [1]said. Holiday carrier Condor Airlines, owned by British travel giant 
Thomas Cook, was compelled to threaten the pilots with a two-year jail term in a letter released by the company on 
June 12, German magazine Focus[2] reported Friday. In the letter accessed by the news magazine, pilots were 
warned of "criminal relevance" of "secret video footage and its distribution." 
"We have learned of the following facts: within the circle of the pilots, there are obviously some colleagues secretly 
taking photos and/or video recordings of the female colleagues who show the affected persons in clear sexual 
acts," the letter read. The report also stated the videos were then distributed among colleagues without the consent 
of the persons concerned. However, during an internal investigation, the airline did not find any such videos, reports 
stated[3]. Reacting to the reports, the airline stated it did not have any evidence or statements that confirmed the 
claims.  Condor warned the pilots of 'serious consequences' including dismissal from job and criminal proceedings. 
The company said: "We are rigorously pursuing any allegation. We will, of course, initiate disciplinary and legal 
measures if we find that there is any substance to any kind of claim. We have informed our employees of the 
rumors and reminded them of our strict code of conduct which we expect all employees to adhere to at all time," 
reported The Local[4]. It is not clear if the stewardesses violated any rules by engaging in sexual acts on planes. 
This is not the first time that an alleged sexual act, filmed or photographed on an airplane, prompted a reaction from 
the airline. A pilot of British Airways was suspended[5] in October after pictures emerged of a man — thought to be 
the pilot himself —performing a sex act wearing women's stockings. In an incident in June[6], that involved flight 
passengers, a video of a couple appearing to engage in a sexual act aboard a Ryanair flight from Manchester to 
Ibiza went viral, prompting the airline to issue a statement condemning the incident. 'We are looking into this matter. 
We will not tolerate unruly, disruptive or inappropriate behavior at any time and any passengers who appear to 
behave in an unacceptable manner may be liable for further sanctions,' the airline said[7]. The couple, however, 
maintained that no intercourse happened. Another passenger couple who performed a similar act[8] on a 
Southwest Airlines flight in August was questioned by police and was let off without any charges. A statement by 
Southwest Airlines said: 'On Saturday, two passengers traveling on Southwest flight 3246 from Atlanta to Las 
Vegas were engaged in inappropriate activity. Our Crew became aware of the situation and approached the 
Customers to address the behavior. The situation escalated and the Crew contacted local authorities to meet the 
flight.' 'Southwest does not condone this type of behavior and we apologize to the other passengers onboard who

were potentially exposed to this activity,' it further read. [ 1]: http://www.focus.de/panorama/welt/bilder-oeffentlich-

Most UK bosses who back Brexit keep their views on the subject out of the corporate domain. Not so Tim Martin. 
Beer mats and the company's in-house magazine left drinkers in JD Wetherspoon pubs in no doubt as to his stance 
on the matter.
Much of the group's results statement was devoted to the same subject. The remainder of it showed the group 
doing well; profit was up 15 per cent in the first full year since the Brexit vote. Selling cheap beer and food to Brits is 
not a business dependent on close trading links with Europe. Goods from EU suppliers could be readily substituted 
and just 5 per cent of staff are EU nationals.
Many other listed companies with Brexit-backing bosses are similarly UK-focused. The main risk they face is a 
slowdown in UK consumer spending that Mr Martin says has not happened (despite "doom-mongering" by the 
Financial Times and others). Clothing retailer Next said on Thursday that conditions were "encouraging". For those 
that do sell abroad, Europe tends to be a less important market than the US or Asia. It is just 5 per cent of revenue 
at Next and 3 per cent at Jardine Lloyd Thompson, the insurer.
Post-EU poll share price showings tell us little. Shares in Wetherspoon are up 38 per cent since June 2016 thanks 
to improved trading, while it has bought back shares and boosted its estate's quality. CMC Markets is down 45 per 
cent because of a threatened regulatory crackdown, not because of founder Peter Cruddas's views on Europe.
Longer-term performances are often impressive. Wetherspoon has returned 4,690 per cent since floating in 1992. 
Next and Hargreaves Lansdown, a financial group, have also done well. Then again, so has Ryanair, whose chief 
executive was an advocate of staying in the EU.
Pro-Brexit bosses: beer-mat politicians
Behind the scenes, business comes first. Good bosses' political views do not colour their decisions. Investors 
should keep politics out of theirs, too.
Silicon Valley investors are rebooting an old concept - the cash shell - with the aim of disrupting traditional initial 
public offerings. Venture capital firms Social Capital and Hedosophia say they have received a "tidal wave" of 
inquiries from private tech groups hoping to be smuggled on to the public markets. That may not translate into a 
successful takeover, however.
After raising $700m from a group of "curated" institutions, the firms can now use their self-named special purpose 
acquisition company, or Spac, to go shopping. Their bold target range, which includes debt, is $3bn-$20bn.
The chosen unicorn will be "acquired" by the Spac, which went public on Thursday. In practice, existing 
shareholders will retain majority ownership in the new entity, just as in a normal IPO. The pseudoacquisition will 
mean a quicker listing, however. The price will be set by negotiation rather than underwriters.
At least that is the theory. It relies on Social Capital Hedosophia valuing a company better than the market. Still, 
investors have demonstrated their desire for a unicorn: which will they get? Analysis by CB Insights lists 53 private 
tech groups valued at $2.5bn-$20bn. Of these, Spotify is already set to go public. At $20bn, Palantir and WeWork 
are probably too big. SoFi is mired in scandal. Instacart has been shell-shocked by Amazon.
Others, including Pinterest, Vice and Lyft, have all raised money recently, making them unlikely candidates. The 
investment team's bias is to the US and Europe, which removes 22 from Asia.
Social Capital already backs Slack, a conflict that makes a deal unlikely.
That leaves 17 companies headed by Dropbox, the file-storage group valued at $10bn. The Spac has two years to 
find a target or hand the money back.
The first hurdle has been vaulted - investors have signed up. Now comes the hard part. Under scrutiny, that tidal 
wave of targets, turns into an unimpressively small pool.
If Billy Beane does arrive in Barnsley, as part of a mooted £20m deal for the Championship football club, there is a 
chance that the pioneer of "Moneyball" analysis in baseball could transform the Tykes. One good season is all it 
takes to win promotion to the Premier League, the land of riches. A history of financial losses is a minor detail next 
to the gush of cash from television revenues in the distance.
Follow that money upstream, however, and the buyers and owners of football clubs might start to feel less 
confident. Its source is the worldwide sale of TV rights to screen live matches, which has kept fans paying up for 
premium packages of www.channels.TV companies no longer pay for rights based on their intrinsic value, but 
because live sport underpins the entire business model of selling expensive bundled packages of TV channels. The 
situation, which is also true for the fabulous wealth of the US sports leagues, can be expected to last only as long 
as that bundled TV proposition can be defended.
How far off is the tipping point? Football viewing figures in the UK were down last year, and while Sky TV has 
continued to grow subscriber numbers, the rate of subscriber churn has been rising. Its growth is sustained in part 
by Now TV, the online version that lets customers buy occasional access to content. Billed as a gateway to full pay-
TV, it looks a lot like a future of cheaper pay-as-you-go TV similar to what is available online.
The company has also repackaged its sports channels to let viewers buy access just to cricket, football or rugby, if 
that's their preference.
The reckoning may not come in the next round of rights negotiations, which for the Premier League begins early 
next year. At some point, though, income from TV will drop, threatening the wage structures and transfer values of 
football clubs. Whichever way you crunch the numbers, living on less money will not be a ball.

Highlight: Nóirín O’Sullivan’s departure has not solved any of the problems plaguing the Garda, write Michael 
Brennan and Francesca Comyn 
Body
It is a force with 13,000 gardaí, 2,000 civilians and an annual budget of €1.5 billion. But the departure of Garda 
commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan less than halfway through her term has once again highlighted the desperate need 
to reform our policing service.
One of the simplest signs of how the force is struggling is that many gardaí driving patrol cars cannot chase 
criminals or speed to an emergency because they have not had adequate driver training. This problem has been 
highlighted for years, due to untrained gardaí being involved in several serious collisions after putting on the siren. 
But the latest Policing Authority report shows new recruits are still leaving the Garda College in Templemore without 
this ‘flashing blue light’ training.
When a new chief executive is appointed to a scandal-hit company, a common approach is to lay bare all of the 
problems immediately and then promise to fix them. O’Sullivan took a different tack, which was a mistake. She 
signalled that a wave of further problems would be coming down the track but provided no detail. That meant each 
scandal became associated with her reign when it emerged, from the falsification of 1.45 million breath tests to the 
mysterious money movements in the Garda training college.
She spoke during her time in office of “suffering” from criticism of Garda problems that she herself had helped to 
shine a light on as Commissioner. But when it came to fixing them, the recent Policing Authority report found that 
only nine out of 50 supposedly completed initiatives had been finalised satisfactorily.
“It was the cumulative effect of one mistake after another that saw the back of O’Sullivan. None of the issues 
seemed to be addressed in any meaningful way,” said one retired garda.
Where to now for a police force in crisis?
This retired garda touted maverick Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary as the sort of dynamic business 
mindset the force could do with at such a critical juncture. “They need someone like him to shake the job up and get 
on with it, tell it as it is and not pussyfoot around.”
O’Sullivan did not help her case by being only available to the media for brief doorsteps. She was advised internally 
to one-to-one interviews, but she did a grand total of two during almost three years in office. Her human side and 
personal story remained largely hidden. It meant that the public only saw the ‘Garda commissioner’ rather than 
‘Nóirín”. One notable exception was when she spoke publicly at a Garda conference about how she was bitten, spat 
at and assaulted on a number of occasions on duty, including one incident that resulted in a dislocated shoulder.
When O’Sullivan was appointed interim commissioner in March 2014 after the departure of Martin Callinan, she had 
two meetings with Garda whistleblower Sergeant Maurice McCabe at Garda headquarters to discuss his complaints 
about his treatment by some members of the force. She had not been involved in any of the issues he had raised 
about poor policing practices in his former Cavan-Monaghan Garda division and elsewhere. But at the start of the 
state inquiry into the matters, O’Sullivan’s legal team accused McCabe of being motivated by malice. The final 
report later found he had “acted out of genuine and legitimate concerns”. But this response instantly raised 
questions about O’Sullivan’s attitude to whistleblowers.
Alan Bailey, a former detective who had served for 39 years in the Garda, said a reformed force had to change its 
attitude to whistleblowers. “You have to accept that as a member of an organisation, if I see something wrong, I 
should be at least entitled to flag it and be listened to,” he said.
Bailey himself was involved in the investigation of the murder of two women at the Grangegorman hospital complex 
in 1997. He and another garda had opposed a poorly considered decision to charge a heroin addict called Dean 
Lyons with the murders. The charges were later dropped when another man, Mark Nash, confessed to the crime.
“I brought up issues that a man in custody charged with two murders wasn’t guilty. I know the reaction I got. There 
was nothing subtle about it. Myself and a colleague were told we were wrong,” he said.
O’Sullivan’s departure came as a surprise to her senior officers, who got word of it from her just a few hours before 
she released her retirement statement. The government had got advance warning at the highest level a few days 
earlier due to the discussions over her pension arrangements.
As this newspaper reported last week, O’Sullivan would have had to remain in office until November 25 to qualify 
for the maximum lump sum of about €300,000 and a pension of up to €100,000. That would have marked her third 
year in office − and Garda rules dictate that these payments are based on the best three years of the last ten years. 
However, the government was not going to allow this to stand in the way of an immediate exit by O’Sullivan. 
Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe agreed to allow her seven months as interim Garda 
Commissioner to count as well, pushing her over the three-year mark.
In her departure statement, O’Sullivan namechecked the Dáil’s Public Accounts committee (PAC) as being part of 
the “unending cycle” of requests, questions and public hearings that had consumed her regular policing job.
Fianna Fáil TD Seán Fleming, the chair of the PAC, admitted that when he saw O’Sullivan and her senior 
management team there for meetings lasting up to seven hours, the thought did occur to him: “Who is catching all 
the criminals if you are in here?” In total, the PAC held five public meetings with O’Sullivan this year − most of them 
to do with the Garda College.
The PAC committee meetings revealed an extraordinary level of rancour at the top of Garda management, with 
senior officers contradicting O’Sullivan and each other about the Garda training college scandal. One source in the 
force said the Garda had shot themselves in the foot so often, they had run out of feet to shoot.
Fine Gael TD Alan Farrell, a member of the committee, said the events of the last 12 months had highlighted 
extraordinary deficiencies in middle and upper level management in the Garda.
Where to now for a police force in crisis?
“It requires a culture change as quickly as humanly possible,” he said.
However, Garda headquarters was known to be unhappy with the tone of the questioning at PAC by Sinn Féin 
deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald, and the committee’s vice chair, Labour TD Alan Kelly. Kelly, when he was 
presiding over the PAC meetings, took the unusual step of making O’Sullivan answer every question herself and 
refusing to allow her to pass them on to members of senior management. McDonald accused O’Sullivan of 
engaging in “verbal Pilates” and told her to “stick to the knitting”. That is a phrase that does mean to keep to the 
point, but it was ill-advised when dealing with the country’s first female Garda commissioner. It obviously rankled 
with O’Sullivan herself. “With respect, we are not knitting here,” she told McDonald in response.
Fleming said O’Sullivan had been a good witness during her many appearances there. But he said the process of 
getting information from the force had been slow and painful.
“There’s a lesson there to be learned for the incoming Garda commissioner, to know that public accountability is a 
fundamental part of the job. They have to understand that and not be swamped by it,” he said.
If O’Sullivan proved a disappointment to gardaí on the ground, even her strongest detractors readily accept that she 
had leadership qualities. By comparison, her interim replacement Dónall Ó Cualáin is seen as the ultimate 
caretaker manager.
He is involved, at least in a proxy way, in a Garda whistleblower controversy. When Athlone-based garda Nick 
Keogh made a protected disclosure in May 2014 alleging corruption and Garda collusion in the local heroin trade, Ó 
Cualáin was appointed to head up an internal investigation, which lasted well over a year. Keogh later filed a 
complaint with the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission alleging the investigation was a cover-up.

Pic: Bryan Meade[/caption]
Even if Ó Cualáin is entirely vindicated, Keogh’s case is just one of many potential landmines likely to detonate at 
the Disclosures Tribunal which has a mandate to look at Garda treatment of whistleblowers.
Ó Cualáin has ruled himself out of the running for the job of commissioner. There are other senior gardaí said to be 
interested in the role who will position themselves as competent and committed to change. But the government 
appears keen to sidestep existing management in favour of positioning an outsider or civilian in the top job 
(although of course it is for the Policing Authority to nominate the successful candidate).
“I suppose the only legitimate candidate at this stage would be from outside. After the debacle with O’Sullivan’s 
predecessor we would have thought Nóirín was the great white hope,” said a mid-ranking Garda source.
One of the main barriers to appointing a commissioner from abroad is that they will be given responsibility for a key 
part of the country’s intelligence services. “There’s a lot of blasé commentary from politicians about this. No other 
country would have a foreigner in charge of national security. It would be absolutely unthinkable,” said a Garda 
source.
The Commission on the Future of Policing is looking at whether there should be a separate national security agency 
set up along the lines of Britain’s MI5 or the National Security Agency in the US. But it is not due to report until 
September next year. Fianna Fáil justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan said he believed one possible solution would 
be for a commissioner from abroad to look after policing and for a deputy commissioner to be given responsibility 
for national security issues.
“We need to rebuild confidence in the guards. It’s a force with a fine history. But it’s been damaged by these 
issues,” he said.
For a new commissioner to succeed, there will need to be a clearout of some of the senior Garda management. 
Róisín Shortall of the Social Democrats said the concern was that the appointment of a new Garda commissioner 
would not in itself be sufficient to effect cultural change.
Where to now for a police force in crisis?
“It appears a lot of officers felt they could engage in falsifying figures with impunity. If that is how many people feel 
within the Gardaí, then there is a very deep-rooted problem in the culture,” she said. “One person will be swallowed 
up by that culture unless they are supported by other people of a like mind. In our view that means bringing in a 
whole new team.”
That would involve stripping away some, if not all, of the assistant and deputy commissioners.
But what price change? In Northern Ireland, the Patten redundancy scheme for some 5,000 former RIC police 
officers cost almost £500 million (€568 million). Given the severe pressures in housing and health, it is tricky to 
imagine the government throwing wads of money at Garda reform.
Back in the early 2000s, the Morris tribunal into Garda corruption in Donegal reported that there was a “small, but 
disproportionately influential, core of mischief-making members who will not obey orders, who will not follow 
procedures, who will not tell the truth and who have no respect for their officers”.
There are still stories today of a minority of gardaí who will not take orders, who go home early from their shifts and 
who encourage members of the public not to even bother reporting crimes. Clearly, the proper management the 
Morris tribunal called for is still lacking.
There has been talk for years of the Garda copying the army’s highly successful cadet system, so that a group of 
recruits are given specific training to be managers.
PwC has been given a €500,000 contract to carry out a cultural audit of the Garda. The thinking behind this is in line 
with that of Labour leader Brendan Howlin, who last week quoted business management guru Peter Drucker: 
“Culture eats strategy for breakfast.”
Then there is the ongoing problem of Garda visibility. “You can drive through a town in Ireland and not see a guard,” 
said one retired member of the force.
The latest Garda public attitudes survey for the second quarter of this year shows that just 36 per cent of the public 
were aware of Garda patrols in their local area. The Policing Authority have put down greater Garda visibility as a 
priority for next year’s policing plan.
It is not encouraging that the training centre of the force − the Garda College in Templemore, Co Tipperary − has 
been mired in controversy over irregular payments. Question marks also hang over the qualify of the training 
provided to new recruits.
During the boom, the Garda College was packed to the rafters with new recruits to meet the Fianna Fáil-led 
government’s promise of an extra 2,000 gardaí. Many highly qualified recruits were taken in, but there were others 
of low ability who would never have made it otherwise. These have been described as a “group of duds” who have 
been causing problems in the force for over a decade now. In a sign of just how rushed the process was, one 
probationer garda was found to have a bench warrant outstanding for his arrest for a previous public order offence. 
In the past, such a person would have never even qualified for an interview. The only option for this poorly 
performing batch of “Celtic Tiger” gardaí is urgent retraining because it will be nearly impossible to sack them.
Garda sources say student gardaí are still not getting quality training when they are sent out to small rural stations 
to learn their trade. They say the only way to do it is assign the probationers to busy city stations, where they will 
learn much faster and get better experience.
Her lucrative pension package aside, O’Sullivan’s final bow is not how anyone would wish to end a 36-year policing 
career: undone by a plethora of scandals in the force from dubious financial transactions at Templemore college to 
the disclosures tribunal and the falsification of 1.45 million breath tests.
She leaves behind a force divided both at the higher echelons and among rank and file gardaí, who are pointing the 
finger at management over bogus breath tests. But then again, the only time historically when changes have been 
made in An Garda Síochána is when it is at rock bottom.

Michael O'Leary is nothing if not audacious. So it is entirely in character for the chief executive of Ryanair to claim 
victory after this week's ruling from the European Court of Justice, and then swiftly move on to the question of his 
mooted bid for Italy's ailing Alitalia.
The truth is rather more ambiguous, allowing unions and investors to judge that any victory could be a hollow one. 
In the end, Ryanair's insistence that its employees across Europe be obliged to take any disputes to Irish courts 
was knocked back.
The case was brought by six former Belgium-based workers who claim they have missed out on wages and 
benefits by being subject to Irish contracts. These specify that any disputes should be heard in Irish courts.
Ryanair won its argument that the home base - where crew start and end their journeys - should not be the sole 
determiner of jurisdiction for any dispute with staff.
But it lost in the sense that the court did rule that the home base and where duties are habitually performed should 
carry significant weight. As a result the case will now be heard in Belgium, not Ireland.
In investors' eyes, this judgment could open the way to new disputes in other more employee-friendly jurisdictions, 
and eventually an increase in labour costs.
Ryanair chief claims court win but investors wary Airlines
Before that happens, the Belgian court will have to decide which laws are applicable to the Ryanair case. Will they 
be Belgian or Irish? For the time being, Mr O'Leary insists that employees will continue to be hired on Irish 
contracts.

MILAN (AP) - The Codacons consumer advocacy group said Ryanair's decision to cancel 2,000 flights over the

travelers," and that passengers should be fully reimbursed or rebooked on other flights at no additional cost.
Codacons added that "in light of what happened, the air carrier does not seem the most adapted to take over 
Alitalia."
Ryanair's CEO has said the low-cost carrier would make a bid for the long-range assets of Alitalia, which filed for

Ryanair was dealt a blow in its legal battle to force employees across Europe to take disputes to the Irish courts 
after the European Court of Justice ruled that cabin crew based in other countries could pursue legal claims locally.
The ruling knocked Ryanair shares after analysts suggested it could call the lowcost carrier's employment model 
into question, leading to potentially higher labour costs. It could also open the door to claims from crew in other 
countries over terms and conditions.
Ryanair insisted, however, that there would be no change to its practice of employing staff across Europe on Irish 
contracts, which give the carrier costeffective benefits over some other EU countries in terms of productivity and 
wage levels.
While the jurisdiction was decided by yesterday's ruling, the battle now will be to decide whether Irish law will still 
apply, regardless of the jurisdiction.
This decision is at least three to four months away and then the complaint itself - from six cabin crew based in 
Belgium - will have to be decided. Eddie Wilson, the airline's chief people officer, said he did not think the ruling "will 
in any way alter our Irish contracts of employment".
"Irish legislation has adopted all EU directives on employment rights which ... in some cases, offers better 
protection than some EU countries; for example, maternity leave in Ireland is more favourable than in Belgium."
Ryanair suffers legal blow on crew contracts Airlines
Ryanair claimed it had won a victory after the court ruled that the location where staff were based was only one of 
several factors, albeit a significant one, in determining jurisdiction.
However, transport unions rejected Ryanair's claim and insisted that the ECJ's findings marked the first blow to an 
opportunistic use of more favourable labour laws.
"Ryanair's claim that this judgment supports them stretches reality beyond its breaking point. It's pure wish 
fulfilment.
The verdict is clear. They lost. Big time," said Ruwan Subasinghe, legal adviser to the International Transport 
Workers' Federation, which represents 700 transport trade unions from 150 countries.
The ECJ's decision is the latest to be taken in the sensitive area of workers' rights.
The EU's highest court, which began its early life adjudicating mainly over trade disputes, has in recent years ruled 
on everything from an employee's right to wear a hijab in the workplace to whether a plumber should consider their 
travelling hours as part of their working day.
Geert Van Calster, a professor at the Institute for European Law in Leuven, said the Ryanair ruling was not the 
"final blow" for the airline but would probably set a precedent in an area where EU governments are also becoming 
more sensitive to the rights of mobile workers.
Ryanair shares closed down 3.11 per cent at (EURO)17.47.

RYANAIR'S interest in an Alitalia takeover has taken off, with the airline saying yesterday it is in the process of 
finalising a binding offer for the Italian flag carrier.
The Irish carrier's chief executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters: "We would have to order new planes, whether 
Boeing or Airbus."
He added that Ryanair preferred to own its fleet, as opposed to lease planes like Alitalia, and that he hoped his 
airline would maintain jobs for pilot and crew, but said they would have to be on new terms in line with Ryanair's 
cost base.
A Ryanair spokesperson confirmed to City A.M. that Ryanair is involved in the process and intends to make a 
binding offer.
Alitalia was put up for sale earlier this year, after the Italian government approved its collapse into administration in 
May, following a vote by employees which rejected a rescue plan.
O'Leary also said Ryanair was not interested in a bid for Air Berlin, which filed for insolvency last month, as the 
process was not transparent, and would benefit Germany's largest airline Lufthansa.
He said he anticipated European Union competition authorities would demand substantial remedies if Lufthansa 
bought Air Berlin, with the airline likely to have to relinquish slots on German routes to preserve competition.

Ryanair is in the process of finalizing a binding offer for Alitalia, which will see it keep the brand, long-haul 
operations but changing the fleet for short-haul routes, CEO Michael O'Leary said on Thursday.
"We would have to order new planes, whether Boeing or Airbus," O'Leary told Reuters, adding that Ryanair 
preferred to own its fleet, rather than lease planes, as Alitalia does.
He said Ryanair hoped to preserve jobs for pilots and crew, although warned they would have to be on new terms 
in line with Ryanair's cost base.
He added that Ryanair was not interested in bidding for Air Berlin because the process was not transparent, 
repeating previous accusations that it was a stitch-up designed to make Lufthansa stronger.
He said he expected EU competition authorities would demand substantial remedies in the event Lufthansa buys 
Air Berlin, with the carrier likely to have to give up slots on routes within Germany to preserve competition.

One of Ryanair's Boeing 737-800s has been diverted to East Midlands airport after departing London Stansted, with 
initial indications that it lost a wheel on take-off.
The aircraft had been bound for Copenhagen on 15 September.
East Midlands airport's operator confirms that the aircraft had a "technical problem", but has yet to disclose further 
details.
It adds that the aircraft has landed safely.
FlightGlobal has received information from air traffic control sources that a nose-wheel was located in the vicinity of 
Stansted's runway 22.

Ryanair lost an EU court battle on Thursday in which the airline had sought to continue imposing business-friendly 
Irish labour laws on cabin crew working elsewhere in Europe, in a case with implications across the low-cost airline 
sector.
The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled in favour of cabin crew based at the Irish carrier's Charleroi 
airport base in Belgium. The employees took the airline to a local court, believing Belgian law would be more 
favourable to them.
Ryanair argued that Irish law applied to their Irish contracts.
"The Court points out first of all that, as regards disputes related to employment contracts, the European rules 
concerning jurisdiction are aimed at protecting the weaker party," the Luxembourg-based ECJ said in a statement.
"Those rules enable inter alia an employee to sue his employer before the courts which he regards as closest to 
this interests," it said.
The ruling will come as a relief to cabin crew in Europe who are unsure what laws apply to them.
The crew involved in the case had employment contracts drawn up under Irish law which said their work was to be 
regarded as being carried out in Ireland since they were working on Irish-registered aircraft.
But Charleroi airport in southern Belgium was designated as their base, meaning they started and ended their 
working days there and had to reside within an hour of that airport. (Reuters)

From 1 November Ryanair will change its boarding rules regarding luggage. The hold allowance will go up from 
15kg to 20kg, the industry standard (although many follow the IATA recommended 23kg), with the current hand 
carry-on bags service modified.
Only Priority Boarding customers (including Plus, Flexi Plus & Family Plus) will be allowed to bring two carry-on 
bags on the aircraft. All other (i.e. non-priority) customers can bring one smaller carry-on bag on board the aircraft, 
while their second (bigger) wheelie bag must be placed in the hold (free of charge) at the boarding gate.¬This 
seems to go against the airline,Äôs previous policy, which was to try to reduce hold baggage.
The standard check-in bag fee will be cut from ¬£35 to ¬£25 for this 20kg bag. The maximum size of cabin baggage 
remains at 55cm x 40cm x 20cm, as other airlines.¬What constitutes a small carry-on bag remains to be seen.
Ryanair put the cost at more than ,Ç¨50m a year in reduced checked bag fees and forgot to mention the reduced 
airport handling charges.

Irish air accident investigators have called on the Portuguese civil aviation authority to review current legislation 
regarding the use of dangerous lasers after a Ryanair flight crew was forced to abort a landing because a pilot was 
'temporarily blinded.'¬An investigation into the incident, at Porto Airport in Portugal on September 5 2015, has 
highlighted the lack of legislation in Portugal covering the targeting of aircraft with lasers.
The probe into the incident was delegated by the Portuguese authorities to the Irish Department of Transport's Air 
Accident Investigation Unit as Ireland is the 'state of registry' for the incident aircraft.
The incident flight was a scheduled service from Lille in France to Porto Airport in Portugal. Shortly after 9 pm, the 
Boeing 737-800 was on its final approach when the co-pilot, who was the pilot flying, was distracted by a green 
laser light being shone towards the aircraft.¬ The laser was not pointing directly at the aircraft and then disappeared 
from view, leading the co-pilot to believe that it had been switched off. <br class="" /><br class="" />However, 
shortly after establishing on the final approach track, a laser was directed towards the aircraft from the same area 
but this time illuminated the cockpit. The co-pilot put his left hand up to shield his eyes.¬ The commander, who was 
acting as pilot monitoring and was unaware of the laser, looked up at that moment and her eyes were struck by the 
laser light. She sustained flash-blindness which is a temporary visual loss or impairment during and following 
exposure to a light flash of extremely high intensity. The effects may last for several seconds to a few minutes. <br 
class="" /><br class="" />As a result, flight crew coordination was compromised which led to the final descent being 
delayed and the approach becoming unstable.¬ The co-pilot reported that his vision had not been affected. The 
laser was seen operating from an area close to the centre of Porto, which he stated was a 'common occurrence'. 
<br class="" /><br class="" />While there are strict laws in Ireland that deal with the targeting of aircraft with lasers, 
it is not an offence in Portugal to illuminate an aircraft with a laser or other bright light. As a result, the investigation 
unit has made one safety recommendation, that: "The Portuguese Civil Aviation Authority should review the current 
civil aviation legislation with a view to taking account of occurrences of deliberate or reckless illumination of aircraft, 
or persons involved in the operation of aircraft, by laser light or similar." <br class="" /><br class="" />A spokesman 
for the investigation unit said: "A safety recommendation was made in our report to the Portuguese civil aviation 
authority. As per European and Air Accident Investigation Unit requirements, [we] will track response from the 
Portuguese authorities and will populate the Safety Recommendation Information System which is the European 
database for safety recommendations." www.irishexaminer.com

European passengers flying long-haul to the US or South America will be able to book flights through easyJet after 
the UK airline launched a service aimed at connecting flights internationally.
It has teamed up with long-haul carriers Norwegian Air Shuttle and Canada's WestJet to allow people to book 
connecting flights on a combined ticket. EasyJet said it was in talks with other carriers to expand the service, called 
"Worldwide by easyJet".
EasyJet is rolling out the initiative at Gatwick, its largest base. It plans to expand it to Milan Malpensa, Geneva and 
Barcelona, as well as Paris Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam Schiphol.
It comes as Ryanair, easyJet's main low-cost rival, has been working on similar plans.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, has been vocal over his plans to offer connecting flights to long-haul operators, 
but the airline has encountered delays in signing deals. Ryanair is also in talks with Norwegian.
In May, Ryanair revealed a deal to sell flights to the US and Latin America as part of a partnership with Air Europa.
It is looking at expanding this to allow customers to connect to Air Europa long-haul flights through Madrid.
"EasyJet appears to have stolen a march on Ryanair, which has been working on similar concepts for connecting 
flights and making much noise but less progress," Gerald Khoo, analyst at Liberum, said.
EasyJet in hub deal with Norwegian and Westjet Airlines
He noted that technology, compensation liability and airport co-operation had been obstacles.
EasyJet has overcome those problems by using the GatwickConnects product launched in 2015, which helps 
passengers self-connecting from one flight to another at the airport.
The move is an attempt to compete better with traditional flag carriers such as Air France-KLM and British Airways, 
part of International Airlines Group, which rely on a traditional connecting model.
Carolyn McCall, easyJet's outgoing chief executive, said it was targeting 70m passengers who fly long-haul through 
the airports easyJet operates in.

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) issued a statement welcoming the decision of the 
European Court of Justice in the 'Mons' case which found in favour of the company by rejecting the CTC Union 
argument that the home base should be the sole determinant of what court jurisdiction can hear disputes on labour 
issues. The company noted that the ECJ decision does not change the status quo of Irish Contracts of Employment 
for Ryanair crew based across Europe.   Ryanair's Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said: 'Maintaining broad 
assessment criteria ensures that the most appropriate jurisdiction should apply in cases involving international 
transport workers rather than a sole criterion approach, which would narrow the assessment and restrict movement 
and flexibility with a myriad of regulations and different crews throughout Europe.'

Mass Protests In France Against Macron Labour Law But Impact Limited

 French President Emmanuel Macron's approach to his flagship labour law reforms appeared to be paying off for 
the moment as a one-day strike called by the hardline CGT union had limited impact on Tuesday.
According to the Interior Ministry, at least 223,000Â protesters nevertheless took to the streets to decry what CGT 
head Philippe Martinez described as "a law to give full power to employers."
The CGT said 500,000 people had joined some 200 protests countrywide against measures that Macron, for his 
part, argues are needed to give employers the confidence to create new jobs.
Police in Paris said they fired tear gas at some 300 masked protesters who had thrown projectiles at them. The 
Interior Ministry saidÂ 13 arrests were made across the country.
The Eiffel Tower closed its lifts andÂ top story due to strikes, allowing only access by stairs to the first floor, while 
Irish airline Ryanair Holdings PLC complained that it had had to cancel 110 flights.
Suburban trains in Paris were also disrupted, but most other transport services operated normally, with the other 
two main union groups largely shunning the CGT's call for a one-day strike.
The leader of France's largest union group, Laurent Berger of the CFDT, told France 2 television that the decrees 
unveiled by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on August 31 were "not a good reform".
But, he argued, the union that engaged with the consultation process led by Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud had 
"succeeded in ensuring that a number of even worse steps were not taken".
The reforms to France's complex and highly protective labour code were a key campaign commitment by Macron, 
who took office in May.
He saidÂ that businesses neededÂ more flexibility in order to create jobs and reduceÂ an unemployment rate that 
has drifted between 9 and 10.5% since 2010.
Mass Protests In France Against Macron Labour Law But Impact Limited
The draft decrees announced by Philippe, and due to be formally adopted by the government on September 22,Â 
allow a greater range of working conditions to be agreed at company level rather than sector-wide.
They also allow the smallest companies to negotiate directly with staff or their chosen representatives, rather than 
with unions.
"It's not a labour law, but a law which gives full power to employers," Martinez charged in an interview with 
newspaper Le Parisien on Sunday.
Despite the limited response to the strike call, leftist leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said he was confident Macron 
could be "made to pull back."
"Mr Macron knows that this is a trial of strength and he looked for it. Now it's up to us to rise to the challenge," 
Melenchon said as he joined protests in Marseille.
Melenchon's hard-left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), despite holding only 17 seats in the 577-strong 
National Assembly, has managed to win the limelight as Macron's most determined opponent.
It has called its own day of protest for September 23, while the CGT is planning to take to the streets again on 
September 21.
As the Paris march dispersed at the city's southern Place d'Italie, one GCT official argued that they had not 
expected that one day of protest would be enough, but it was a good start.
"There aren't just activists here," Veronique Pascalides of the union's public finance branch told dpa. "It's a very 
good day for the start back after the summer holidays."
The protests were taking place as Macron travelled to the French Caribbean to visit the islands of Saint Martin and 
Saint Barthelemy, devastated last week by Hurricane Irma.
A day ahead of the protests, the president doubled down on controversial comments on Friday describing 
opponents of the reform as "idlers."
The phrase referred to "all those who think that we can do nothing, that we have that luxury," he told reporters.

From 1 November Ryanair will change its boarding rules regarding luggage. The hold allowance will go up from 
15kg to 20kg, the industry standard (although many follow the IATA recommended 23kg), with the current hand 
carry-on bags service modified.
Only Priority Boarding customers (including Plus, Flexi Plus & Family Plus) will be allowed to bring two carry-on 
bags on the aircraft. All other (i.e. non-priority) customers can bring one smaller carry-on bag on board the aircraft, 
while their second (bigger) wheelie bag must be placed in the hold (free of charge) at the boarding gate.¬This 
seems to go against the airline,Äôs previous policy, which was to try to reduce hold baggage.
The standard check-in bag fee will be cut from ¬£35 to ¬£25 for this 20kg bag. The maximum size of cabin baggage 
remains at 55cm x 40cm x 20cm, as other airlines.¬What constitutes a small carry-on bag remains to be seen.
Ryanair put the cost at more than ,Ç¨50m a year in reduced checked bag fees and forgot to mention the reduced 
airport handling charges.

       By Andrew McCathie, dpa   BERLIN (dpa-AFX) - Air Berlin passengers faced fresh chaos on Tuesday after the 
beleaguered German airline cancelled 100 flights due to a surge in the number of pilots reporting sick.   The reason 
for the cancellations is 'an extraordinary number of sick reports in the cockpit,' said a spokesman for Germany's 
second-biggest airline, which last month filed for insolvency.     Air Berlin has asked passengers to check the status 
of their flight on the airline's website prior to their arrival at the airport after it said it was cancelling 100 of its 
scheduled 750 flights for Tuesday. 
 About 200 of the 1,500 pilots due to fly on Tuesday had called in sick, the airline said.  'Today is a day that the 
existence of Air Berlin is threatened,' wrote Air Berlin chief operations officer Oliver Iffert in an internal memo seen 
by dpa.   Calling it a 'pilot revolt,' the daily Bild reported that the reason for the jump in the number of pilots claiming 
to be sick was a dispute over their possible transition from the insolvent airline to a potential new buyer.  However, 
the pilots' union, Vereinigung Cockpit, denied the report, saying: 'At no point did the VC call for (pilots) to report ill.'   
Air Berlin said it would offer affected passengers the 'best alternative travel' options.  The airline announced on 
Monday that it had slashed a series of international flights as a result of the need to reduce its long-haul operations 
as part of insolvency proceedings.    This included flights to the Caribbean from the western German city of 
Dusseldorf to September 24.  The German government was forced last month to provide the airline  with a bridging 
loan of 150 million euros (180 million dollars) to help it to continue operating.  Potential buyers have until September 
15 to lodge offers for the struggling carrier, with Germany's biggest airline Lufthansa among bidders seeking to 
acquire parts of Air Berlin.  German businessman Hans Rudolf Wohrl this week also unveiled a 500-million-euro bid 
for Air Berlin, which ran up a loss last year of about 782 million euros and has debts totalling nearly 1.2 billion 
euros.   Air Berlin has operated at a loss every year since 2008, except for 2012, when it sold off its frequent flyer 
programme.  In the meantime, budget airline Ryanair stepped up its campaign on Tuesday to take on Lufthansa in 
its home base of Frankfurt with the Irish carrier announcing 34 new flights from Germany's biggest airport from the 
middle of next year.   Copyright dpa

Mass protests against Macron labour law but strike impact limited
Mass protests against Macron labour law but strike impact limited

French President Emmanuel Macron's approach to his flagship labour law reforms appeared to be paying off for the 
moment as a one-day strike called by the hardline CGT union had limited impact on Tuesday.
According to the Interior Ministry, at least 223,000 protesters nevertheless took to the streets to decry what CGT 
head Philippe Martinez described as "a law to give full power to employers."
The CGT said 500,000 people had joined some 200 protests countrywide against measures that Macron, for his 
part, argues are needed to give employers the confidence to create new jobs.
Police in Paris said they fired tear gas at some 300 masked protesters who had thrown projectiles at them. The 
Interior Ministry said 13 arrests were made across the country.
The Eiffel Tower closed its lifts and top story due to strikes, allowing only access by stairs to the first floor, while 
Irish airline Ryanair complained that it had had to cancel 110 flights.
Suburban trains in Paris were also disrupted, but most other transport services operated normally, with the other 
two main union groups largely shunning the CGT's call for a one-day strike.
The leader of France's largest union group, Laurent Berger of the CFDT, told France 2 television that the decrees 
unveiled by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on August 31 were "not a good reform."
But, he argued, the union that engaged with the consultation process led by Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud had 
"succeeded in ensuring that a number of even worse steps were not taken."
The reforms to France's complex and highly protective labour code were a key campaign commitment by Macron, 
who took office in May.
Mass protests against Macron labour law but strike impact limited
He said that businesses needed more flexibility in order to create jobs and reduce an unemployment rate that has 
drifted between 9 and 10.5 per cent since 2010.
The draft decrees announced by Philippe, and due to be formally adopted by the government on September 
22, allow a greater range of working conditions to be agreed at company level rather than sector-wide.
They also allow the smallest companies to negotiate directly with staff or their chosen representatives, rather than 
with unions.
"It's not a labour law, but a law which gives full power to employers," Martinez charged in an interview with 
newspaper Le Parisien on Sunday.
Despite the limited response to the strike call, leftist leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said he was confident Macron 
could be "made to pull back."
"Mr Macron knows that this is a trial of strength and he looked for it. Now it's up to us to rise to the challenge," 
Melenchon said as he joined protests in Marseille.
Melenchon's hard-left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), despite holding only 17 seats in the 577-strong 
National Assembly, has managed to win the limelight as Macron's most determined opponent.
It has called its own day of protest for September 23, while the CGT is planning to take to the streets again on 
September 21.
As the Paris march dispersed at the city's southern Place d'Italie, one GCT official argued that they had not 
expected that one day of protest would be enough, but it was a good start.

Macron tactics pay off as protests against French labour law limited

President Emmanuel Macron's approach to his flagship labour law reforms appeared to be paying off for the 
moment as a one-day strike called by the hardline CGT union had limited impact on Tuesday.
Tens of thousands nevertheless took to the streets to decry what CGT head Philippe Martinez described as "a law 
to give full power to employers."
The CGT claimed 500,000 people had joined some 200 protests across the country against measures that Macron, 
for his part, argues are needed to give employers the confidence to create new jobs.
In Paris, police estimated the crowd at 24,000, while public broadcaster Franceinfo quoted the CGT as saying 
60,000 took part.
Police said they fired tear gas at some 300 masked protesters who had thrown projectiles at them, and made four 
arrests.
The Eiffel Tower closed its lifts and top story due to strikes, allowing only access by stairs to the first floor, while 
Irish airline Ryanair complained that it had had to cancel 110 flights.
Suburban trains in Paris were also disrupted, but most other transport services operated normally, with the other 
two main union groups largely shunning the CGT's call for a one-day strike.
The leader of France's largest union group, Laurent Berger of the CFDT, told France 2 television that the decrees 
unveiled by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on August 31 were "not a good reform."
But, he argued, the union that engaged with the consultation process led by Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud had 
"succeeded in ensuring that a number of even worse steps were not taken."
Macron tactics pay off as protests against French labour law limited
The reforms to France's complex and highly protective labour code were a key campaign commitment by Macron, 
who took office in May.
He said that businesses needed more flexibility in order to create jobs and reduce an unemployment rate that has 
drifted between 9 and 10.5 per cent since 2010.
The draft decrees announced by Philippe, and due to be formally adopted by the government on September 
22, allow a greater range of working conditions to be agreed at company level rather than sector-wide.
They also allow the smallest companies to negotiate directly with staff or their chosen representatives, rather than 
with unions.
"It's not a labour law, but a law which gives full power to employers," Martinez charged in an interview with 
newspaper Le Parisien on Sunday.
Despite the limited turnout, Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the hard-left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) 
party said he was confident Macron could be "made to pull back."
"Mr Macron knows that this is a trial of strength and he looked for it. Now it's up to us to rise to the challenge," 
Melenchon said as he joined protests in Marseille.
La France Insoumise, despite holding only 17 seats in the 577-strong National Assembly, has managed to win the 
limelight as Macron's most determined opponent.
It has called its own day of protest for September 23, while the CGT is planning to take to the streets again on 
September 21.
As the Paris march dispersed at the city's southern Place d'Italie, one GCT official argued that they had not 
expected that one day of protest would be enough, but it was a good start.
"There aren't just activists here," Veronique Pascalides of the union's public finance branch told dpa. "It's a very 
good day for the start back after the summer holidays."
The protests were taking place as Macron travelled to the French Caribbean to visit the islands of Saint Martin and

Ryanair will add 34 new routes from Frankfurt Main and station three additional aircraft at the German base next 
summer.
The budget carrier says its Frankfurt network will gain six Greek destinations – Athens, Corfu, Chania, Kefalonia, 
Mykonos and Santorini – as well as one each in Morocco and Poland: Agadir and Krakow, respectively.
Nine new Spanish routes are to be added: to Barcelona, Girona, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, Madrid, Murcia, Seville, 
Tenerife and Valencia. Ryanair will additionally serve six new Italian destinations: Bergamo, Brindisi, Catania, 
Perugia, Pisa and Venice Treviso.
The Dublin-headquartered carrier will also start flights to UK airports Glasgow, London Stansted and Manchester, 
French cities Marseille, Perpignan and Toulouse, and Croatian coastal destinations Pula, Rijeka and Zadar. The list 
of new destinations from Frankfurt is completed by Lisbon and Porto in Portugal.
To support the expansion, Ryanair is to boost the number Boeing 737s it has based at the German airport from 
seven to 10. The airline estimates that the new routes will allow it to increase its Frankfurt passenger numbers by 
1.2 million to 2.6 million per annum.
FlightGlobal schedules data indicates that only seven of the new 34 routes are not already served by other carriers 
as passenger routes. Lufthansa is the biggest competitor, operating on nine of the 34 new Ryanair routes, ahead of 
Condor on seven.
Ryanair also intends to add a new route to Plovdiv from Hahn airport, located some 115km west of Frankfurt Main. 
FlightGlobal schedules data indicates that this will be the Bulgarian city's only German link.

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair said on Tuesday it would base three more aircraft at Frankfurt airport from summer 
2018 to add 34 new routes including Athens, Lisbon and Marseille.
That brings the number of planes it has at Germany's biggest airport to 10, encroaching further onto rival 
Lufthansa's territory.
An increase in flights from low-cost carriers is helping Frankfurt airport operator Fraport to boost passenger 
numbers this year, with the company saying earlier it had seen a 5 percent increase in August.
Asked at a news conference whether Ryanair could grow further at Frankfurt airport after next summer, Chief 
Commercial Officer David O'Brien said that depended largely on the competitive environment.
"We've recently added Munich, we may do more there. If (Berlin) Tegel stays open... it's conceivable that we would 
put more aircraft there," he said. (Reuters)

Ryanair faces a fresh shareholder revolt at its annual meeting this month after adviser groups called on investors to 
vote against executive pay and the re-election of chairman David Bonderman.
An influential trio of advisers - Institutional Shareholder Services, Glass Lewis and Pirc - have recommended 
investors vote against the low-cost carrier's advisory pay report, flagging concerns about "poor disclosure" and 
bonus payments.
ISS, which advises more than 1,700 of the world's biggest investors, and Pirc also advised against the re-election of 
Mr Bonderman, blaming the chairman for corporate governance failures at the Dublin-based carrier.
Mr Bonderman, chairman and founder of the buyout group TPG, stepped down from the board of Uber after making 
a sexist comment during a meeting at the ride-hailing company.
Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers has frequently clashed with shareholders at its annual meetings. 
Last year, almost a fifth of investors revolted on pay - the third year in a row when the airline faced significant 
protests over its remuneration policies. ISS, Glass Lewis and Pirc, whose recommendations are used by asset 
managers and pension funds when deciding how to vote, said the total pay of Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary was 
not excessive, but expressed concerns about how his bonus was calculated. His pay last year was (EURO)3.26m, 
including a bonus.
Glass Lewis said it had "severe reservations about supporting the remuneration report at this time".
Ryanair faces fresh rebellion on executive pay Airlines
It added: "We believe shareholders should be concerned by the structure of the company's executive remuneration 
programme and the inadequacy of disclosure regarding several aspects of executive compensation."
Mr O'Leary has repeatedly dismissed concerns about pay structures at the airline and big bonuses at listed 
companies.
He said last week: "My view of shareholders voting against my pay package is: if you don't like it, don't vote against 
it - sell your shares."
In a statement to the Financial Times, Ryanair said: "We're confident that all of the pay resolutions will be 
overwhelmingly passed by shareholders this year, as they are each year."

Ryanair will crack down on carry-on wheelie bags because luggage-laden passengers are delaying flights as they 
struggle to find overhead locker space.
The airline said its policy of allowing travellers to carry on two bags - introduced as part of chief executive Michael 
O'Leary's attempts to be more customer friendly - had proved too popular.
Passengers that have not paid £5 for priority boarding will from November 1 be restricted to one piece of hand 
luggage, the company said yesterday. People with priority boarding will still be allowed to bring two bags on board.
Pitching the changes as part of its "Always Getting Better" programme, the airline said it was trying to encourage 
customers to put their bags in the hold. It will increase its check-in bag allowance from 15kg to 20kg - and cut the 
fee from (EURO)/£35 to (EURO)/£25. Ryanair said these changes would cost it more than (EURO)50m in lost 
check-in charges.
"Flights are a lot busier and too many customers have too much stuff when they travel with us," said Kenny Jacobs, 
chief marketing officer at Ryanair. "We can't have flights delayed and customers don't want their flights delayed." 
Airlines, particularly low-cost carriers, have been increasingly trying to boost their overall profits through ancillary 
revenue, such as making money from baggage fees, onboard meals and services on top of ticket sales.
Ryanair targets carry-on bags to stem delays Airlines
But John Strickland, director of air transport consultancy JLS Consulting, said passengers had "wised up" to 
additional fees being levied. "It's become a Frankenstein's monster, not just for Ryanair but every airline: we're all 
carting on our wheelie bags in place of checking them in."
Mr Jacobs said Ryanair's move was not a return to the past, when the airline had a reputation for poorer customer 
service.
"In the bad old days we weren't as profitable, we weren't as big and we didn't have the load factor that we have 
today. We remain committed to strongest demand and having the lowest fares, so there is no return to the bad old 
days."
Some airlines, including Norwegian, have warned that passengers might be asked to check in carry-on bags on 
busy flights.

BUDGET airline Ryanair said yesterday that customers will no longer be able to take two bags into the cabins of its 
planes, because this was causing delays.
The company also announced that it would reduce the cost of checking in luggage from £35 to £25, resulting in lost 
income of (EURO)50m (£45.7m).
Shares in the airline closed down around one per cent yesterday following the announcement.
Neil Wilson, senior analyst at ETX Capital, said the lost income had some investors worried: "It hopes to claw this 
back by encouraging more people to check in bag but investors aren't buying it. Worries about a turbulent second 
half, terror attacks in Europe and falling average fares have already got the market worried, although traffic growth 
in August was strong."
Meanwhile, rival Easyjet released its traffic stats for August yesterday, following Ryanair's on Tuesday. The number 
of passengers flying with Easyjet increased more than nine per cent on last year to 8.2m.
The load factor was 96.3 per cent, up 1.4 points on last August, as appetite for holidays continued to the end of 
summer.
Easyjet shares jumped one per cent just after the statistics were released but later dropped to closed down 0.43 per 
cent.

Ryanair has announced today that only Priority Boarding customers (including Plus, Flexi Plus & Family Plus) will 
be allowed to bring two carry-on bags on the aircraft from November.
Ryanair claim this is being done to encourage more customers to check in bags and reduce the number of 
customers with 2 bags at the boarding gates. The airline claims too many customers are availing of Ryanair’s 2 free 
carry-on bags service, and with high load factors (97% in August) there is not enough overhead cabin space for this 
volume of carry-on bags, which is causing boarding/flight delays.
It was also announced today that the check-in bag allowance will increase from 15kg to 20kg for all bags while the 
standard check-in bag fee will be cut from €/&pound;35 to €/&pound;25 for this 20kg bag. 
All other (i.e. non-priority) customers will only be allowed to bring one smaller carry-on bag on board the aircraft, 
while their second (bigger) wheelie bag must be placed in the hold (free of charge) at the boarding gate.
Announcing the changes today, Ryanair’s Kenny Jacobs said, "These bag policy changes will cost Ryanair over 
€50m p.a. in reduced checked bag fees. However, we believe offering bigger bags at reduced fees will encourage 
more customers to consider checking-in a bag, which will reduce the high volume of customers we have with 2 
carry-on bags at the boarding gates, which is causing flight delays due to large numbers of gate bag and cabin bag 
offloads."
He added, "We hope that by restricting non-priority customers to one small carry-on bag – their wheelie bag must 
be placed in the hold, free of charge at the boarding gate – this will speed up the boarding of flights and eliminate 
flight delays being caused by not having sufficient overhead cabin space on busy flights to accommodate over 360 
(182 customers x 2 bags) carry-on bags."

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) said that it will lower checked bag fees and raise 
size allowance to eliminate boarding delay. The bag policy changes will cost Ryanair over 50 million per annuam in 
reduced checked bag fees. The lower bag fees and increased bag size allowances will come into play for all 
bookings for travel after 1stNovember. 
The Only Priority Boarding customers, including Plus, Flexi Plus & Family Plus, will be allowed to bring two carry-on 
bags on the aircraft.  The  non-priority customers will only be allowed to bring one smaller carry-on bag on board 
the aircraft, while their second (bigger) wheelie bag must be placed in the hold (free of charge) at the boarding gate.  
Ryanair believes offering bigger bags at reduced fees will encourage more customers to consider checking-in a

Ryanair is changing its baggage policy as its struggles to accommodate carry-on luggage in overhead cabin space 
are causing delays.
The budget carrier's passengers are currently permitted to bring a wheeled case and a smaller bag into the cabin. 
But from 1 November, that allowance will apply only to passengers with priority boarding status, says Ryanair. 
Other passengers must hand in their wheeled cases at the boarding gate for placement in the aircraft's cargo hold, 
free of charge.
Ryanair will also reduce prices nearly a third for checked-in baggage "to encourage more customers to check in 
bags and reduce the number of customers with two bags at the boarding gates".
As "too many" passengers use the current allowance of two carry-on bags per person, "there is not enough 
overhead cabin space... which is causing boarding/flight delays", notes the carrier.
In addition to lowering baggage fees, Ryanair has raised the weight allowance for checked-in luggage from 15kg to 
20kg.
"We believe offering bigger bags at reduced fees will encourage more customers to consider checking in a bag," 
states Ryanair's marketing chief Kenny Jacobs, who estimates that the luggage policy change will cost the airline 
over 50 million ($60 million) per annum in lost fees.

ROME (AP) - Ryanair's CEO says the low-cost carrier will make a bid for ailing Alitalia's long-range assets by Oct. 
2.
Michael O'Leary reiterated the intentions of his low-cost carrier to pick up parts of Alitalia, which filed for bankruptcy 
in May.
O'Leary also told reporters Wednesday that relaunching Alitalia requires job cuts, no matter who buys the company.
The ANSA news agency further quoted O'Leary as saying Ryanair would offer Alitalia growth prospects meaning 
eventually more job security for more people. He said Alitalia employees who'd work for Ryanair would have to 
work hard and that strikes wouldn't be tolerated.
O'Leary said Alitalia should have more long-range routes for Asia, Africa and North America.
Italian government officials have said they want to avoid seeing Alitalia's assets split up for sale.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) is withdrawing a policy of two free cabin bags after passengers took advantage of the 
generous offer, cramming too much luggage onto the planes and causing delays, according to a Bloomberg report.
The carrier will permit only one carry-on starting Nov. 1, with the second bag having to be checked in the hold. Only 
customers paying for "priority" tickets will get to take the second bag into the cabin, the report noted.
There are 182 people on average on a Ryanair aircraft and a lot of them are bringing two big bags, and "you simply 
can't get all those bags into the cabin," Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs was cited as saying.

SOME 12.7m passengers flew on Ryanair routes in August, the airline said yesterday - up 10 per cent from the year 
before.
Meanwhile, its load factor - how full its planes were - rose to 97 per cent, one percentage point higher than during 
the same month last year.
The airline's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said the rise was thanks to its continued PR drive, dubbed 
"Always Getting Better". Last month Ryanair announced a similar rise, with passenger numbers rising to 12.6m, up 
11 per cent on the previous July.
It may be one of the final Augusts Brits can fly with Ryanair: the airline's boss, Michael O'Leary, has been strongly 
outspoken on the subject, warning of a "real and distinct threat" flights from the UK to the European Union could be 
grounded after Brexit.
Last month he said the aviation industry had a "hard deadline" of September 2018 for an agreement between the 
EU and the UK to be reached on the sector. "September 2018 is when we will start seeing the shit hitting the fan," 
he said. "Otherwise we will have to start cancelling flights and taking them off sale."

 The following is a summary of top news stories Tuesday.----------COMPANIES----------Aveva Group confirmed it 
has agreed to a GBP3.00 billion-plus merger with the software arm of France's Schneider Electric. Aveva said 
Schneider Electric is to take a 60% stake in the enlarged Aveva, which will remain listed in London and 
headquartered in Cambridge, with the merger classified as a reverse takeover. The deal, which values Aveva at 
GBP1.7 billion, will create one of the UK's biggest listed software companies, consummating a courtship that began 
in 2015. Aveva said the GBP550 million in cash being paid by Schneider - about 858 pence per Aveva share - plus 
GBP100 million of excess cash on Aveva's balance sheet, will be returned to shareholders, together representing 
1,014p per Aveva share.----------Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings said it grew both the number of passengers 
carried and load factor in August year-on-year. Ryanair said it carried 12.7 million customers in August, up 10% 
from 11.5 million customers in August 2016, while load factor rose by 1 percentage point to 97% from 96%. On a 
rolling annual basis, traffic increased by 13% to 126.2 million customers.----------Anglo American said its De Beers 
diamond unit's seventh sales cycle of the ten to be held this year generated a total sales value of USD505 million, 
falling from the prior sale. 
Anglo American owns 85% of De Beers, one of its three core units alongside copper and platinum. The value of the 
seventh sales cycle of 2017 dropped from USD576 million in the sixth sales cycle announced at the start of August, 
which in turn had risen from USD541 million in the fifth sales cycle of the year. The latest sale was considerably 
lower than the same sale in 2016, which was valued at USD639 million. ----------AstraZeneca said Sheri McCoy and 
Deborah DiSanzo have both been appointed as non-executive directors. McCoy will join at the start of October and 
DiSanzo will begin at the start of December. McCoy is the chief executive of Avon Products Inc and joined the 
London-listed pharmaceutical giant in 2012. DiSanzo is currently the global general manager for IBM Watson 
Health.----------Complaints about banks and insurers in Britain rose in the first half of 2017, with the figures still 
dominated by loan insurance as a compensation deadline for mis-selling is publicised, Reuters reported. Citing 
figures from the Financial Ombudsman Service, Reuters said complaints in January to June totalled 170,000, up 
13% on the second half of 2016, with almost two thirds of the complaints relating to only 10 companies. Payment 
protection insurance complaints totalled 90,000, with Lloyds Banking Group and its units topping the complaints

table, Reuters said.----------DS Smith said it has made an "encouraging" start to its financial year, with trading in line 
with its expectations. The FTSE 250 recycled packaging supplier said it has seen "strong demand" for its enhanced 
packaging products across the business in the period since May 1, with the rate of like-for-like volume growth well 
ahead of the comparative period the year before. Progress with its pan-European and e-commerce customers has 
been particularly strong, DS Smith said, adding that the recovery of recent increases in paper prices is progressing 
as expected. The firm said the benefit of the short-term recovery on paper prices is being mitigated by operational 
leverage coming from strong top-line growth. ----------Halfords Group reported growth in revenue in the 20 weeks 
ended August 18 and maintained its guidance for the full year. The car parts and bicycle retailer said revenue in the 
20 weeks rose by 4.8% year-on-year, as 6.2% growth in Retail offset a 1.4% decline in Autocentres. On a like-for-
like basis, revenue grew by 2.7%, with a 3.5% increase in Retail and a 2.0% decrease in Autocentres.----------
Housebuilder Redrow said demand in the new homes market in the UK has remained robust despite a reduction in 
overall housing transactions, reflected by Redrow's raised dividend for its recently-ended financial year. The FTSE 
250-listed company reported a record pretax profit of GBP315.0 million for the year ended June 30, a 26% increase 
from GBP250.0 million the year before. This was on revenue which grew by 20% to a record number of USD1.66 
billion, from GBP1.38 billion.----------MARKETS----------London shares were higher following the losses seen on 
Monday as investors continue to keep an eye on the standoff with North Korea. AVEVA was leading midcaps, up 
28%, after the announcement of its merger with the software business of Schneider Electric. The pound was down 
against the dollar after data showed growth in the UK services sector slowed in August. Wall Street was pointed to 
a lower open. ----------FTSE 100: up 0.2% at 7,425.46FTSE 250: up 0.4% at 19,784.62AIM ALL-SHARE: up 0.1% at

THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday approved a German bridging loan for Air Berlin that will keep the insolvent 
airline's planes flying while it tries to find buyers for its assets.
Air Berlin, Germany's second-largest airline, filed for bankruptcy protection in August after shareholder Etihad 
Airways withdrew funding following years of losses.
The government pledged a (EURO)150m (£138m) loan to prevent Air Berlin's planes from immediately being 
grounded, which would have stranded holidaymakers abroad and put around 8,000 jobs at risk only weeks before a 
national election.
"The measure will allow for the orderly wind-down of the insolvent airline Air Berlin without unduly distorting 
competition," the Commission said in a statement.
The money will last at most until mid-November, which means the pres-sure is on to agree a carve-up of Air Berlin, 
whose assets include about 140 leased aircraft and valuable take-off and landing slots in Germany.
German flagship carrier Lufthansa has government backing to take over large parts of the airline. Britain's Easyjet 
and Thomas Cook's Condor are also seen as likely bidders.
HSBC analysts said they expected Ryanair , which has said it is not bidding for Air Berlin assets, to also expand its 
capacity in Germany after Air Berlin is split up.

Also yesterday, German businessman Alexander Skora said he is bidding for Air Berlin with unidentified 
international investors and aims to keep it flying with a limited route network. "I mean routes such as Majorca and 
other selected destinations," he said in a statement.
Under his proposal, Lufthansa would take over Air Berlin's long-haul routes and Easyjet other European routes, the 
statement said.

The European Commission has approved plans by the German government to grant the country's troubled air 
carrier Air Berlin a temporary bridging loan worth 150 million euros (178.76 million dollars).
Air Berlin, Germany's second-largest airline and an employer of 7,200 people in the country, filed for insolvency in 
August after its main shareholder, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, withdrew financial support.
The move forced the German government to step in to provide the airline with a temporary credit of 150 million 
euros to help it continue operating.
Last week Michael O'Leary, the head of the Irish budget airline Ryanair, complained that the insolvency process 
was designed to strengthen German airline Lufthansa, who has expressed an interest in buying a large share of 
assets in the bankrupt airline.
The commission said in a statement that Germany "committed to ensure that either the loan will be fully repaid, or 
Germany will submit awinding-down plan for Air Berlin."
"The loan will be paid out in instalments under stringent conditions. In particular, Air Berlin has to demonstrate its 
liquidity needs on a weekly basis and new instalments will only be paid when all existing liquidity has been used," 
according to the statement.
"The Commission found that the measure will help to protect the interests of air passengers and to maintain air 
passenger services."

       By Naveena Kottoor, dpa   BRUSSELS (dpa-AFX) - The European Commission has approved plans by the 
German government to grant the country's troubled air carrier Air Berlin a temporary bridging loan worth 150 million 
euros (178.76 million dollars).  Air Berlin, Germany's second-largest airline and an employer of 7,200 people in the 
country, filed for insolvency in August after its main shareholder, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, withdrew 
financial support.  The move forced the German government to step in to provide the airline with a temporary credit 
of 150 million euros to help it continue operating. 
 Last week Michael O'Leary, the head of the Irish budget airline Ryanair, complained that the insolvency process 
was designed to strengthen German airline Lufthansa, who has expressed an interest in buying a large share of 
assets in the bankrupt airline.  The commission said in a statement that Germany 'committed to ensure that either 
the loan will be fully repaid, or Germany will submit a winding-down plan for Air Berlin.'  'The loan will be paid out in 
instalments under stringent conditions. In particular, Air Berlin has to demonstrate its liquidity needs on a weekly 
basis and new instalments will only be paid when all existing liquidity has been used,' according to the statement.   
'The Commission found that the measure will help to protect the interests of air passengers and to maintain air 
passenger services.'   Copyright dpa

Great Northern Distillery, the whiskey maker backed by exploration entrepreneur and Cooley founder John Teeling, 
is set to raise another €2.5 million, bringing its total funding to €15 million.
The Dundalk-based operation is raising the funds through the state backed Employment and Investment Incentive 
Scheme (EIIS) of tax-friendly investing, with Cantor Fitzgerald gathering the backers.
This fourth tranche of funding for Great Northern will be used to lay down its next stock of whiskey. EIIS 
investments are for a minimum of four years, which suits the setting down period required by whiskey, Cantor 
Fitzgerald’s head of corporate finance Conor McKeon said.
Apart from Teeling, investors include James Finn and David Hynes, who, along with Teeling, co-founded Cooley 
Distillery, the whiskey producer that sold to Jim Beam for $95 million.
Cantor Fitzgerald is also putting together a substantial fundraise for a technology company backed by Ryanair heir 
Declan Ryan’s Frontline Ventures, which will come back into that deal with another investor for over €1 million. EIIS 
investors can claim a €40 tax rebate on every €100 invested.
Cantor has been raising EIIS capital since 2011. It has raised €38 million for nine high-growth Irish businesses to 
date, in sectors including food, drink, telecoms, technology and renewable energy. It structures each investment on 
a company by company basis. Cantor has a private investor base of 22,000 clients.
“A company will come to us and we’ll evaluate the business, its market opportunities, its management track record 
and past and future performance and then we’ll sit down with our distribution channel and say ‘this is the 
proposition’,” said McKeon.
“Over the past three years every project we’ve taken on has been successful.”
Funding pours into Great Northern Distillery
Among others, Cantor has raised EIIS funding with O’Hara’s brewery, NewsWhip, marine engineering company 
Cathx, two wind farm projects and the €10 million financing of Longford nursing home Laurel Lodge. Northern 
Distillery is likely to raise a further round in coming months.

I n 1989, when the French franc (remember that?) was cheap and a pre-Ryanair wave of British romantics sought a 
slice of la France profonde, we bought half a house in Languedoc. It was a village in Burgundy that had shown me 
how much more rural rural France seemed than rural Britain but I was worried that a holiday home in such a leading 
wine region might be an oxymoron.
Back then, Languedoc and Roussillon, its neighbour to the south-west, were producing wines that seemed 
centuries less evolved than the great wines of France. I liked the idea that an array of styles was available in the 
region, but felt safe from feeling that I ought to be spending my precious summer weeks of R&R visiting wine 
domaines.
When we arrived, grapes were about the only crop grown in Languedoc and it was their produce that largely filled 
the notorious EU "wine lake" with thin, characterless red that no one wanted to drink. Successive schemes were put 
in place to drain this lake and transform the landscape so that vines on the least propitious (flat and fertile) land 
were grubbed up. This left a more significant proportion growing in more promising sites at higher elevations, on 
slopes and on poorer soils so that yields were lower and the resulting wine more interesting and concentrated. Only 
a small proportion of the vines that used to surround our house remain.
My visits to Languedoc wine producers are still rare. That is because I treasure the contrast between my weeks with 
family and friends at the house and my busy travelling schedule the rest of the year. But it isn't because the wines 
are not worthy of attention.
What's up, Languedoc?
This summer I was struck by how much great wine is being produced here (white and rosé, as well as red), and 
what wonderful bargains most are. And I was thrilled to see continued proof of the excitingly tense dry whites that 
can be grown on higher ground in Roussillon. These wines are so full of individuality, encompassing a range of 
terrains, grape varieties and winemaking methods, that I could not help comparing them with the narrower range of 
flavours available from, say, Bordeaux and Burgundy - whose wines are generally much more expensive (some cult 
Languedoc wines, such as Grange des PÈres and Peyre Rose, are exceptions).
I am not referring to the international varietals, often from the larger, more commercial producers, that tend to carry 
the IGP Pays d'Oc appellation. Some of these are perfectly nice (and good value) but many are pretty dull.
It is perhaps significant that of the 28 wines chosen by a professional panel as this year's collection of ambassador 
wines for the Pays d'Oc, half of them were white, with Chardonnay and Viognier being most common - 14 as 
opposed to 12 reds and two rosés.
Not long ago, Languedoc vineyards were dominated by the dark-skinned Carignan grape. Then there was a vogue 
for planting Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon - neither particularly suitable for the region. But now, as 
elsewhere, it is recognised that traditional varieties work best. So reds tend to be blends of Grenache Noir, its 
"hairy-leaved" version Lladoner Pelut, Syrah, MourvÈdre, Cinsault and Carignan; whites are drawn from Grenache 
Blanc, Grenache Gris, Clairette, Piquepoul, Maccabeu (Viura), Bourboulenc, Rolle (Vermentino), Roussanne, 
Marsanne and Viognier. These can have seriously individual flavours.
T he wines that excited me this year were made from a mix of local grapes, grown - organically and sometimes 
biodynamically - in individual conditions, by small, independent producers.
Tom Hills created Domaine La Lauzeta only in 2015, but with notable success. He produces small amounts of wine 
in a cramped garage in the Saint-Chinian village of Saint-Nazaire de Ladarez, after years spent working as a sugar 
trader in Russia and the US and growing coffee in Nicaragua. He has identified some fine parcels of vines and 
enlisted the help of the excellent local consultant Claude Gros and winemaker Amélie Czerwenka. I was impressed 
by his Jauzimen rosé last year but the reds I tasted this year showed this was no flash in the pan.
Julien and Delphine Zernott arrived from the Loire in 2003 and have painstakingly renovated the cool, isolated 
terraced vineyards above Poujols that constitute their Domaine du Pas de l'Escalette, north of the Terrasses du 
Larzac, a rocky, windswept sub-region of the Languedoc. They wisely ignored advice to pull out such indigenous 
grapes as Carignan Blanc and Terret Bourret and now find that their nervy dry white blend is particularly sought 
after by sommeliers.
Domaine Sainte Marie des Crozes is run by Christelle Alias, whose father Bernard renovated the estate at the end 
of the last century. From hillside vineyards in the northern reaches of CorbiÈres, on the Montagne d'Alaric, she 
produces a range of memorably named and packaged reds.
Meanwhile Brigitte Chevalier abandoned her career exporting bordeaux to establish Domaine de CébÈne in the 
distinctive FaugÈres appellation in northern Languedoc. Like all these producers, she has been making 
differentiated, expressive wines with a real sense of place.
All this meant that this year I was fortunate enough to be able to taste widely and pleasurably without having to 
venture further than a few steps from the front door.
I benefited from the research of an old friend from Cumbria, former wine merchant Richard Neville, who happens to 
have settled with his wife not too many villages away from us. For the past few years, Neville has volunteered to 
collect samples from up-and-coming producers for me and this year he excelled himself.
Then there are consignments of bottles that just seemed to end up on my doorstep, usually delightfully out of the 
blue. Some examples: wines from Domaine Paul Meunier-Centernach, based in the old St-Arnac co-op; and 
German-owned Domaine Courbissac in the wild hills above La LiviniÈre, the first official subappellation within 
Minervois, which may be joined by Cazelles and Laure if their applications are successful.

European airlines, look away now: Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary expects that most will disappear over 
the next half-decade.
Briefing media in London on 31 August, O'Leary predicted that, within such a timeframe, the sector would follow the 
US example and consolidate around "four of five-ish big European airlines, all of whom will have grown to 150 
million to 200 million passengers a year".
He adds: "If you look at the US market you see the emergence of four big carriers – they dominate the industry. 
You are already seeing the same trend here in Europe."
While he foresees that Ryanair will develop to this size "organically", O'Leary expects the likes of IAG, Air France-
KLM and Lufthansa to "grow by merger and acquisition over that period of time".
O'Leary questions whether EasyJet can remain independent, floating the prospect that the UK airline could be 
"merged with someone – possibly an Air France, or an IAG here in Gatwick, or Air France in Paris".
He argues that EasyJet will "struggle to compete with us on price" and suggests that it could adopt a fortress 
strategy of developing "a big impregnable position" at hubs such as Paris and London Gatwick.
Ryanair will not be able to "move in on them", he says, but he also casts doubt on his rival's growth prospects, 
saying that EasyJet will only remain profitable "by being big at those airports".
O'Leary is likewise skeptical regarding EasyJet's chances of retaining both its UK and European operations within 
one business post-Brexit. Problems with that could prompt a merger into a larger carrier group, he believes.
ANALYSIS: Ryanair chief sees airline consolidation gathering pace European airlines, look away now: Ryanair 
's chief executive Michael O'Leary expects that most....
"I think there is a reasonable 50/50 chance they [EasyJet] will merge with either IAG or Air France in the next four to 
five years," he concludes.
A similar fate could await budget rival Wizz, by O'Leary's reckoning. "Wizz I think are too small: Wizz are a niche 
player in eastern Europe, and as we are moving into eastern Europe I think Wizz just get pushed out."
He adds: "Again, I think Wizz will probably finish up being acquired by someone like Lufthansa, which would give 
Lufthansa greater spread across central and eastern Europe, to kind of marry out what they have presently in 
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium – it's the Greater Prussian unification all over again."
More immediately, he expects that Air Berlin, which filed for insolvency earlier this month, will be absorbed by 
Lufthansa to create a "German monster" via what he terms a "stitch-up".
He expects that, while competition regulators will step in to examine the deal and demand remedies, the merger of 
the two airlines will still ultimately happen.
Brexit could have one more potential impact on the consolidation process, O'Leary proposes. If the EU insists on 
designating the UK as a third-party entity following its exit from the bloc, IAG could be broken up as the group's 
structure would be incompatible with ownership and control rules.
In such a scenario, other European players could swoop in to pick up the pieces.
"Air France would quite like to buy Iberia," he suggests. "Now, if they can force BA [owner IAG] to sell Iberia in a 
post-Brexit [scenario], then they could buy Iberia on the cheap."

       THIS WEEK in Brexit: Blame, animosity creep into negotiations   London/BRUSSELS (dpa-AFX) - EU and 
British officials have held perhaps their most disappointing round of talks so far, ending four days of meetings with 
no sign of progress, recriminations on both sides, and little prospect of a smooth resolution to the negotiations.  - 
William Hague, a former leader of British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party, warned that he 
expected 'BIG BUST-UPS' during the months of negotiations until Britain officially leaves the European Union in 
March 2019.  Hague told the BBC that May's negotiating position had been weakened by her poor performance in a 
snap general election in June, when the Conservatives lost their majority in parliament. 'We'll end up having to PAY 
MORE,' he said. 
'We'll pay a bigger price for leaving, I think, because of the uncertainties of the election result.'  - May was occupied 
for most of the week with a trade-focused visit to JAPAN, one of several major economies her government has 
targeted for expanded post-Brexit trade and investment. She promised to work to 'unblock remaining barriers to 
trade and take steps to build the closest, freest trading relationship between the UK and Japan after Brexit.'  May 
told reporters in Japan that she was 'NOT A QUITTER' and would lead the Conservatives into another election in 
2022, despite the pressure that has mounted on her over the June election campaign and criticisms of her Brexit 
policies.  - Michael O'LEARY, the colourful, pro-EU chief executive of budget airline Ryanair, accused May of 
'swanning around Japan drinking tea and sake' instead of handling the Brexit negotiations. 'I fail to see what she's 
doing in Japan for three days at the moment, why she's not in Brussels or in Frankfurt or in Paris, which is where 
these negotiations need to take place,' O'Leary told Sky News.  - Meanwhile in Brussels, top negotiators from the 
EU and Britain met for their third official round of negotiations. But as the week progressed the tone among EU 
officials started sounding increasingly IRRITATED.  - On Monday, before heading into his first meeting the EU's 
chief negotiator Michel BARNIER said he was 'concerned.' 'We must start negotiating seriously,' he said pointing to 
a tight timetable.  - On Tuesday Barnier's boss, Jean-Claude JUNCKER, sounded unimpressed by the position 
papers put forward by the British government in recent weeks. 'I did read with the requisite attention all the papers 
produced by the majesty's government and none of those are actually satisfactory,' Juncker said.  - At Thursday's 
closing press conference Barnier did not try very hard to mask his FRUSTRATION with his British counterparts. The 
two sides 'did not make any decisive progress,' he said.  Barnier warned Britain that, given the STALEMATE on all

major issues, discussions on a future trade and economic relationship between the EU and Britain were unlikely to 
go ahead in October as hoped by the British government.  - British Brexit Secretary David DAVIS acknowledged 
'significant differences to be bridged,' especially over a financial settlement on what Britain owes the bloc, adding 
that his government had a duty to its taxpayers to interrogate any final financial payment rigorously.   Copyright dpa

the British government in recent weeks. "I did read with the requisite attention all the papers produced by the 
majesty's government and none of those are actually satisfactory," Juncker said.
- At Thursday's closing press conference Barnier did not try very hard to mask his FRUSTRATION with his British 
counterparts. The two sides "did not make any decisive progress," he said.
Barnier warned Britain that, given the STALEMATE on all major issues, discussions on a future trade and economic 
relationship between the EU and Britain were unlikely to go ahead in October as hoped by the British government.
- British Brexit Secretary David DAVIS acknowledged "significant differences to be bridged," especially over a 
financial settlement on what Britain owes the bloc, adding that his government had a duty to its taxpayers to 
interrogate any final financial payment rigorously.

Argentina&acute;s first ultra low-cost cost carrier, Flybondi, is looking to secure two additional Boeing 737-800 
leases by the end of the week, following huge interest in the start-up airline.
“We have been overwhelmed with interest from lessors and there is not a week that goes by that some leasing 
company doesn’t come by to talk to us,” said Julian Cook, chief executive officer of Flybondi, at Airfinance Journal’s 
Latin American Aviation Finance event in Rio. ”We have secured three aircraft with SMBC Aviation Capital already 
and we hope to sign another two at this conference.”
Cook, the former CEO of Swiss airline Flybaboo, says the carrier has been offered “brand new aircraft at very 
attractive lease rates” but has chosen to opt for eight-to-12-year-old aircraft instead. “It is unusual to be offered new 
aircraft as a start-up, so we reviewed the deal and decided to stick with mid-life aircraft.”
Flybondi wants to operate 10 Boeing 737-800 fleet by the end of 2018.
It has raised $75 million of additional start-up capital and has been granted 85 routes by the Argentinian 
government, which include 43 domestic and 42 international destinations.
The company plans to start its operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 with 737-800s configured with 189 seats. By 
2021 it is targeting a fleet of 30 aircraft.
Investors in Flybondi include Cartesian Capital , Yamasa, Michael Cawley (former COO at Ryanair), Michael Powell 
(former CFO at Wizz Air), as well as other European and Argentinian private investors.

Air Berlin pilots have jeopardised a potential sale of the insolvent carrier by taking sick days en masse, the airline’s 
management has said.
The German airline was forced to cancel 100 out of 750 flights yesterday when 200 of its 1,500 pilots called in sick 
either during crew briefing or on the way to the aircraft.
Air Berlin chief executive officer Thomas Winkelmann accused the pilots of “playing with fire”.
“Today [12 September) has cost us several million euros. We are currently conducting final talks with potential 
investors. It is essential that operations be stable in order for these negotiations to go well. That is the only way to 
secure as many jobs as possible.”
Pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit expressed surprise at the walkout, which it said it did not call for, and requested 
those pilots not genuinely sick to return to duty.
Several airlines, including Lufthansa, Easyjet and Ryanair, have expressed interest in buying parts of Airberlin’s 
operations and the deadline for investors’ offers is this Friday (15 September).
However, Frank Kebekus, Air Berlin’s chief representative, said that further walkouts could cause the airline to 
cease operations and any restructuring efforts.
“Today’s [12 September’s] events seriously endanger the entire insolvency proceedings under self-administration,” 
Kebekus said. AirBerlin’s creditor’s committee aims to make concrete decisions about its restructuring by 21 
September.

Easyjet is tapping into the long-haul, low-cost market by offering connecting services to transatlantic Norwegian and 
Westjet flights through London Gatwick airport.
Users of its new ‘Worldwide by easyJet’ service will be able to book both the Easyjet and partner airline portions of 
a flight on the Easyjet website.
Connecting flights will be separated by at least 2.5 hours to give passengers time to transfer, and although Easyjet 
won’t hold back flights for connecting travellers, those who miss flights will be transferred to the next available 
service. "The way we have designed Worldwide by easyJet means that we can profitably access a major new pool 
of customers without undermining easyJet’s operating model and punctuality,” says Peter Duffy, Easyjet’s chief 
commercial officer.   Although Easyjet bills the move as “the first global airline connections service by a European 
low fares airline”, rival Ryanair sells 20 Air Europa long-haul routes from Madrid via its own website.   The low-cost 
carrier suffered a pre-tax loss of &pound;212 million ($281 million) in the first half of the year, after which it said it 
would seek to develop additional revenue streams by “exploring new distribution channels, partner agreements and 
structures such as connectivity”.   At Gatwick it had already identified 200,000 passengers who self-connected to 
other airlines each year.
“Many of our guests already self-connect between WestJet and easyJet flights, and this new booking tool will make 
it easier than ever before to travel throughout Europe from Canada and back,” says Ed Sims, WestJet’s executive 
vice-president, commercial. Easyjet wants to expand its connecting service to other airlines at other hubs such as 
Milan Malpensa, Geneva, Amsterdam, Paris Charles De Gaulle and Barcelona.   Scottish regional carrier Loganair 
is already signed up to offer onward travel from Scottish airports.

John Plueger, chief executive of ALC, does not see spacein the market for all of Boeing’s 737 Max variants – the 
Max 7, 8, 9, 10 and 200.
“It's hard to see all of those variants surviving,” he says in an interview with Airfinance Journal. “Certainly, the Max 8 
will, it’s the absolute bread and butter airplane, fabulous, one of our mainstay airplanes.”
Plueger adds: “But I think the tough part is that the Max 200, which so far, a pretty isolated airplane. It's a Ryanair 
airplane.”
Ryanair ordered 100 Max 200s with options for a further 100 aircraft in September 2014.
However, Plueger says “the real question is between the 9 and the 10” variants.
Boeing launched the Max 10 at the 2017 Paris air show, garnering 240 commitments from more than 10 customers.
Although he congratulates Boeing on launching of the programme, Plueger says he is not yet convinced by it.
“When an airplane gets launched, there’s also a lot of incentives provided by the airframer to get it launched. Those 
incentives have been spread around. We’re waiting to see how many more customers come along in the non-
launch phase.”
He adds: “We are mainly concerned about whether the Max 9 and Max 10 ultimately in the market place whether 
both models will survive. A lot of the fundamental issues we’ve had before the launch are still there. Having said 
that, it’s a successful launch and we will react to what we see our airline customers needing and wanting.”
He adds that should the programme gain further momentum, ALC would be happy to make an order, but notes the 
strong success of the A321neo. The US lessor has 55 A321LRs on order.
Other lessors have been vociferous about the Max programme. For example, a white paper issued by Avolon in 
mid-August said that Boeing had been “too reactive” with the 737 Max programme and made too many variants of 
the aircraft type.
Hard to see all the Max variants surviving: Plueger
Plueger adds that despite the summer insolvencies of Air Berlin and Alitalia, he has no big concerns about the 
health of the industry.
He says that IATAtraffic continues to be very strong and those figures do not include some of the large low-cost 
carriers, including Ryanair and Southwest, Airlines, so are actually conservative traffic figures.

The hero in the film The Terminal spent a lot of time in an airport, unable to enter the country or leave it. Those 
monitoring the UK's interminable Brexit negotiations may sympathise. Hard to go forward, even trickier to go back. 
One area of conflict, though, may get more attention sooner: air travel within the EU. Expect a compromise, given 
the high stakes.
The market focuses on three factors: European traffic rights, ownership rules and sterling. The last, which directly 
hits sales and profits, has already registered. Sterling's tradeweighted rate has dropped 15 per cent since last 
summer's referendum, hurting easyJet in particular.
The other two may not have sunk in.
An open skies agreement enables UK-registered airlines to fly to, from and within Europe. Technically, leaving the 
EU means quitting the agreement - and without a replacement treaty, warns Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, flights 
between the UK and EU could be grounded. That seems far-fetched. Other countries would object; almost 70m UK 
passengers fly to Spain annually, a fifth of its EU air traffic, says Frontier Economics. Cutting off the UK might not 
suit Air France-KLM either. The Dutch half profits from UK passengers transferring through Amsterdam's airport.
EU rules require airlines flying within Europe to be European www.owned.No problem now, but troublesome once 
UK investors no longer count as "European". Ryanair thinks it can manage any shortfall by buying stock back from 
US or UK investors, while Stelios Haji-Ioannou, a big shareholder in easyJet (and its new Austriaregistered 
European subsidiary), has dual UK and Cypriot nationality. But neither they nor British Airways owner IAG can be 
certain there will be no issues.
Brexit and airlines: above the clouds; Twitter: @FTLex Email: lex@ft.com
Still, for all Mr O'Leary's warnings, it is hard to believe that either airlines or governments want cessation of UK-EU 
traffic. Expect more soothing noises about air travel in the months ahead.

Next summer Ryanair will have 10 aircraft based at Main and five at Hahn.

Ryanair will bid to operate 90 planes under the Alitalia brand and using existing staff as part of the Italian airline's 
restructuring, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said today.
Ryanair has until Oct. 2 to make a binding bid for all or part of the Italian carrier, which has been put under special 
administration for the second time in less than a decade.
"We will be submitting an offer for the 90 jet aircraft, with their pilots, cabin crew, routes etc," O'Leary told journalists 
at a press briefing in London.
Ryanair would operate the 90 leased planes using existing staff, but the offer would be dependent on some 
redundancies, changes to staff conditions and renegotiation of the leases, he said.
As Ryanair exclusively uses Boeing planes, Alitalia staff would be required to maintain the 90 Airbus planes, he 
said. Ryanair, which only currently operates short-haul routes, would also take on long-haul routes under the deal, 
O'Leary said.
"I think one of the aspects of Alitalia that is really attractive is the long haul fleet. There is the capacity to grow very 
strongly," he said.
Ryanair would be interested in bidding for the whole of Alitalia, which has around 120 planes, but such a deal would 
likely be blocked by regulators as it would leave Ryanair in control of over 50% of the Italian market, O'Leary said.
"We'd be very willing to buy Alitalia. But I suspect... given we're the number one airline in Italy we'd be blocked 
under EU competition rules," he said.

remedies. (Reuters)

Outspoken Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary on Thursday accused British Prime Minister Theresa May of 
"swanning around Japan drinking tea and sake" instead of handling her country's Brexit negotiations in Europe.
"I fail to see what she's doing in Japan for three days at the moment, why she's not in Brussels or in Frankfurt or in 
Paris, which is where these negotiations need to take place," the head of the Ireland-based budget airline told Sky 
News.
"She's just come back from three weeks' holidays in the Swiss Alps," he told the broadcaster.
"Now, everybody is entitled to their holidays, but there's a crisis coming down the road here in the UK economy in 
the next 12 months.
"Brexit is going to be a disaster for the UK economy, and she needs to be over there negotiating, or at least 
removing these roadblocks, not swanning around Japan drinking tea and sake."
O'Leary said he felt the Brexit negotiations, which are continuing in Brussels this week, were "going nowhere."
"They are a bit of a shambles, and they need a bit of leadership," he said.
"From an aviation perspective, the real challenge for us is, because there's no fallback in aviation - we're not 
covered by WTO rules - there is going to be a cessation of flights from March 2019 if she doesn't get her finger out 
and get a deal done in the next 12 months."

Ryanair intends to make a firm bid to acquire Alitalia's fleet of jets, chief executive Michael O'Leary has indicated.
Speaking at a press conference in London today, O'Leary said he intended to make a bid for some 90 Alitalia jets 
by the first week of October, which brings the next phase of the Italian carrier's sale process.
"We would be willing to take on both the short-haul and the long-haul [fleet]," O'Leary says. "One of the aspects of 
Alitalia that is really attractive is the long-haul fleet, which has the capacity to grow very strongly."
He says that all-Boeing operator Ryanair would not have a problem with adding Airbus aircraft and their crews and 
engineers, noting: "We bid previously for Aer Lingus three times – they have only Airbus jets. [When] you bid for an 
airline, it might have Airbus aircraft, but it also has Airbus pilots, Airbus engineers."
O'Leary adds: "We do not have the aircraft to go and replace all of Alitalia's fleet tomorrow, or in one year, or in two 
years, so we would be very willing to buy Alitalia."
Ryanair will not be bidding for the Alitalia's turboprop fleet, in which O'Leary says his airline has no interest. He 
admits that the process of acquiring the jets is "complicated" because the majority of Alitalia's fleet is leased not 
owned.
"The jets are all leased, so we would want those leases, but clearly we want the bankruptcy administrator to 
restructure the leases," he says.
Flight Fleets Analyzer data lists 103 aircraft in Alitalia's inventory. These comprise 72 Airbus A320-family jets 
(including two in storage), 14 A330s, 11 Boeing 777-200ERs and four ATR 72-500 turboprops. Just eight of the 
aircraft are owned by Alitalia: seven A320-family narrowbodies and one 777. The rest are leased.
Ryanair to bid for Alitalia 's jets: O'Leary Ryanair intends to make a firm bid to acquire Alitalia 's fleet of jets, 
chief executive Michael O'Leary has indica....
O'Leary says Ryanair would seek to continue operating the aircraft under Alitalia's "great" brand.
However, O'Leary believes the prospect of Ryanair succeeding in its bid are slim, citing the likelihood that a merger 
would be blocked under EU competition rules. He estimates that Ryanair has 35% of the Italian aviation market and 
that a merger with Alitalia would give it 55%.
O'Leary sees it as more likely that Alitalia will be "broken up" and that Ryanair will benefit in terms of air traffic rights 
and airport slots because "whoever buys them [Alitalia], there will be competition remedies".
Alitalia was put up for sale earlier this year after filing for insolvency protection. Airlines have until 15 September to 
submit an expression of interest in making a binding bid. The airline's special commissioners will then consider 
those offers and notify parties that have met the "requirements". Those shortlisted will have until 2 October to 
submit a binding offer.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) plans to bid to operate 90 planes under the Alitalia brand using existing staff as part of 
the Italian airline's restructuring, Reuters reported, citing comments made by CEO Michael O'Leary at an event in 
London.
The report said Ryanair has until Oct. 2 to make a binding bid for all or part of the Italian airline, which is under 
special administration.
Meanwhile, in a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Ryanair called on the German antitrust regulator, the 
Bundeskartellamt, and the European Commission to block a deal under which Deutsche Lufthansa would buy up 
insolvent Air Berlin assets. 
It said if Lufthansa gets to buy Air Berlin, it would move to a "95% monopoly" from a 68% share of the German 
market. 
"Competitor airlines will struggle to get slots in major airports such as Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Munich, 
where Lufthansa will control over 80% of peak time slots," Ryanair said.

RYANAIR will not bid for any assets of insolvent German airline Air Berlin, its chief executive Michael O'Leary said 
yesterday, describing the process as "a stitch-up".
Air Berlin, Germany's secondlargest airline, filed for bankruptcy protection this month after shareholder Etihad 
Airways withdrew funding following years of losses.
O'Leary has complained that the insolvency process was designed to help strengthen leading German airline 
Lufthansa.
"If there was a fair and open process we would get involved but we are not getting involved in this process because 
it's a stitch-up," he told a news conference in Berlin, adding that Ryanair had not been in contact with anyone from 
the German government, Air Berlin or the administrator.
O'Leary said Ryanair had asked German and European antitrust authorities to investigate what he said was a 
"conspiracy" between Air Berlin, Lufthansa and the German government which would lead to higher prices for 
consumers.
Shares in Ryanair closed down 0.96 per cent.

Ryanair today urged the German Bundeskartellamt, Germany's competition authority, and the EU Commission to 
block the takeover of Air Berlin by Lufthansa.
Ryanair claims this deal would allow Lufthansa to take over Air Berlin “debt free”, which they claim “will be in breach 
of all German and EU competition rules”. Ryanair says Lufthansa is a monopoly that has been supported by the 
German Government, by providing €150m of State Aid to the airline.
Ryanair has an 8% share of the German market and last year said it aims to capture a further 12% by 2021. 
Following Air Berlin's collapse, Ryanair has predicted that it will achieve that 20% market share sooner than 2021.
Ryanair also urged all Berliners to vote “Yes” on 24th Sept to keep Tegel Airport open. Michael O’Leary said, “The 
German Bundeskartellamt and the European Commission must block the anti-consumer stitch-up playing out 
between the German Government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin.  Given that the German Government is centrally 
involved in these manoeuvres (loaning €150m), the Bundeskartellamt will be afraid to impose competition rules. On 
this basis, it is vital that the European Commission takes immediate and decisive action to protect German 
consumers from a Lufthansa high fare monopoly.”

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) said it urged the German Bundeskartellamt and 
the EU Commission to block the stitch-up between the German Government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin plc. 
(AIBEF.PK) to carve up Air Berlin's assets, while excluding major competitors and ignoring both competition and 
State Aid rules, and called for immediate action to block this anti-consumer take-over.  This insolvency is being 
timed to allow Lufthansa to take over a debt-free Air Berlin (its major German competitor) which will be in breach of 
all German and EU competition rules, and this Lufthansa monopoly has been supported by the German 
Government providing \xA4150m of State Aid, so that Lufthansa can acquire Air Berlin, as Lufthansa moves from a 
68% share to a 95% monopoly, which will result in German customers and visitors suffering higher air fares. 
Competitor airlines will struggle to get slots in major airports such as Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Munich, where 
Lufthansa will control over 80% of peak time slots.   Ryanair also urged all Berliners to vote 'Yes' on 24th Sept to 
keep Tegel Airport open. The new Brandenburg Airport will have a capacity of only 27m passengers, which is less 
than Dublin (a city with one-third of Berlin's population).   With almost 33m passengers already travelling through 
Berlin's 2 existing Schonefeld and Tegel airports last year, the planned closure of Tegel will leave Berlin with less 
airport capacity than its existing traffic.

RYANAIR is not hopeful that its complaint to competition authorities over plans by Lufthansa to take over parts of 
insolvent rival Air Berlin will halt the deal, its chief commercial officer said yesterday.
The Irish budget airline has filed a complaint with German and European Union competition authorities over the 
insolvency process, which it described as a "conspiracy" because it believes that Lufthansa will gain a bigger share 
of the German market.
"This would not be allowed in any other European country, we have of course made a complaint to the German 
cartel office and the European Commission," David O'Brien said.
"We shall see what happens but we are not entirely hopeful."
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said last week that the Irish group would also be interested in bidding for 
the whole of Air Berlin, but O'Brien said the Lufthansa bid would probably succeed.
Ryanair's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said yesterday that the group is still interested in some assets 
belonging to Air Berlin, "principally the routes that we could make work well".
"We're interested in the process running the way the process should run," Jacobs added.
At least six bidders for Air Berlin's assets are reported to be preparing to submit offers by the 15 September 
deadline.

Budget airline Ryanair does not plan to bid for any assets belonging to the insolvent German carrier Air Berlin, chief 
executive Michael O'Leary said on Wednesday.
"We will not get involved in this process: it's a stitch-up," O' Leary said in reference to the charge that the insolvency 
process is designed to help strengthen German airline Lufthansa.
Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month after its main shareholder, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad 
Airways, withdrew funding in response to years of financial losses.
The German government has provided the company with a temporary credit of 150 million euros (176 million 
dollars) to help it continue operating for around three more months.
German flagship carrier Lufthansa has expressed an interest in buying a large share of assets in the bankrupt 
airline. Air Berlin officials are also in talks with two other interested parties.

Separately, a regional court in Berlin says it will convene on 15 September to hear a complaint from Germania that

Formula One legend Niki Lauda is interested in buying back the Niki airline, which he founded in 2003 and which 
has since become a daughter of insolvent German carrier Air Berlin.
"I have written a letter to Air Berlin's insolvency administrator, in which I express my interest in [Niki]," he said in an 
interview that the Austrian tabloid Kronen Zeitung published online on Saturday.
He said he would like to get the chance to look into Niki's accounts.
"Only afterwards I can decide whether it would make sense to take over Niki again," said Lauda.
The former champion racer, who serves as the Mercedes Formula One team's non-executive chairman, warned 
that Lufthansa should not be allowed to take over Air Berlin as well as Niki.
"Politicians completely forget that we need competition. A Lufthansa monopoly would be catastrophic," he said.
Air Berlin is holding takeover talks with Lufthansa, Easyjet and Ryanair, German Economic Minister Brigitte Zypries 
said Saturday in Berlin.
Lauda founded Niki in 2003. One year later, Air Berlin bought a 24-per-cent stake in his company. The German 
carrier completely took over Niki at the end of 2011.

Highlight: From solicitor to chairman, James Osborne was an ebullient character never  afraid to take a risk. Matt 
Cooper remembers the former chairman  of INM 
Body
James Osborne was an unusually ebullient solicitor. Many solicitors keep a low profile, especially those who act as 
advisers to big business. Mostly, they rarely impinge on the public consciousness. Osborne may not have been a 
household name, at least to the general public, but he was a solicitor exceptionally well known in Irish business 
circles over a period of nearly 40 years; as an adviser, director and investor. His reputation was as someone never 
afraid to speak his mind, and to hold to his position, publicly or privately, no matter how powerful his adversary. It 
was something that occasionally led him into confrontation.
Osborne, aged just 68, died last week on the same island off the coast of Donegal where his father is buried. When 
I was looking for him only last month to arrange a meeting, I received a text that he was “sailing off the Fastnet at 
present. Will contact on my return in a few weeks”. That he was sailing was not a surprise. For years, he had a 
share in a 46ft cruiser called Hibernia, in which he toured much of the world. Unfortunately, we didn’t get that 
chance to meet before news of his sudden death emerged last weekend.
Osborne was great company, with many stories to tell, although he picked them carefully so as not to breach any 
confidences. He interacted with some of the biggest names in Irish business. These included figures like the late 
Don Carroll and Tony Ryan, and the still very active Larry Goodman and Michael O’Leary. He got caught right in the 
middle of the war waged between Denis O’Brien and Tony O’Reilly at Independent News & Media in the early part 
of this decade, as chairman for an ill-fated period (see panel).
He was, at various times, a director of PJ Carroll and Sons (one of Ireland’s biggest companies in the 1970s and 
1980s), Bank of Ireland, Adare, Eason, Golden Vale and many other companies, most notably Ryanair for 21 years 
until his death. Although rarely, if ever, associated with politics, he was a central figure in one of the biggest 
controversies in Charlie McCreevy’s political career, during McCreevy’s time as minister for finance.
A man who raised the bar
Osborne, in his role as chairman of Punchestown racecourse, where he had used his extensive contacts to raise 
sponsorship and expand racing at the Kildare venue, had charmed McCreevy into supplying the €13 million needed 
for an equestrian centre, which just happened to be slap bang in the middle of McCreevy’s constituency. There was 
further controversy over the supply by the state of passports to members of the billionaire Getty family in return for 
investment at Punchestown and which Osborne negotiated.
Osborne did much of the legal work as GPA raised finance and cut contracts around Wall Street, so much so that 
Ryan tried to persuade him to change jobs
That Osborne had such wealthy connections surprised few. He lived the fullest of lives, both professionally and 
personally. His legal career was remarkable. The son of an RAF pilot who went into business as a solicitor in 
Milford, Donegal, James, who was actually born in Devon in April 1949, was educated at Campbell College, Belfast, 
before returning to the Republic and Trinity College Dublin. He took an arts degree and then qualified as a solicitor 
in 1973 and joined A&L Goodbody, then one of the three main legal firms in Dublin. He made such an impression 
that he was made partner in just six years, at the age of just 29, and headed off to New York, “with one-quarter of 
the firm’s profits in a suitcase”, to set up an office for the company in Manhattan.
The big client he won – making the partnership’s investment worthwhile – was Tony Ryan’s aviation leasing 
company GPA, still in its early stages, but quickly developing a formidable reputation. Osborne did much of the 
legal work as GPA raised finance and cut contracts around Wall Street, so much so that Ryan tried to persuade him 
to change jobs.
Displaying the independence and self-confidence that was to be his hallmark, Osborne said no. Instead, a little 
more than three years after decamping to the US, he returned home in 1982, just 32 years of age, to become 
managing partner of his legal firm, a position he would hold for just over 12 years.
He wasn’t a shrinking violet in seeking new clients for his firm, causing something of a stir among more 
conservative members of the profession who tended to wait for business to approach them. His subtle aggression, 
allied with great charm, quickly meant that A&L Goodbody became the top corporate law firm in the country and 
was excellently positioned to benefit from the establishment of the IFSC, and the quick development of the 
economy that accelerated in the 1990s.
Not content with that workload, he also began to take up positions as a non-executive director at major companies. 
One of his first involvements was with Fieldcrest Ireland, an American-owned towel-making venture that came to 
Kilkenny in partnership with PJ Carroll Industries – the cigarette manufacturer that was then one of the country’s 
most significant businesses and which was trying to diversify from relying on tobacco – and with support from Bank 
of Ireland. It was a financial disaster and the business closed, costing 500 jobs and major losses for the Irish 
shareholders.
Osborne was appointed to the board of PJ Carroll in the mid-1980s, most probably at the behest of Bank of Ireland, 
which was very worried about the investments being made by the company’s overpowering chief executive Donal 
Carroll, known to everyone as Don or ‘The Don’.
Carroll had invested the company’s cashflow in salmon farms and a direct marketing company, to catastrophic 
effect. The young Osborne confronted him in the boardroom. It was particularly sore for Carroll, who had been 
appointed to the top position in the company by his uncle when aged just 29, and who was regarded as one of the 
major figures in Irish business. He was a key associate of TK Whitaker, the legendary civil servant.
“I went to war with [Carroll],” Osborne told the Irish Times in 1999. “He didn’t like me, but I told him I was doing my 
job as a director.” Osborne effected Carroll’s removal and the company was sold to the South African firm 
Rothmans; the ruthlessness of the action, even if necessary, was the talk of Irish business circles at the time and 
impressed as many as it appalled.
When Larry Goodman nearly ruined his business in 1990 through a combination of reckless gambling on the shares 
in the British companies Unigate and Berisford, and failing to recover £180 million owed by Iraq for beef he had 
A man who raised the bar
exported there, Osborne was one of the key figures involved in rescuing him from personal financial ruin after his 
beef company, Goodman International, was saved by the emergency introduction of the examinership laws.
A year later, Osborne went publicly to bat for Goodman when his company’s practices and standards were the 
subject of a damning exposé by Irish journalist Susan O’Keeffe on the British investigative TV programme World in 
Action. Osborne sat beside Goodman at a specially convened press conference at the Shelbourne Hotel the night 
after the broadcast, and was vehement in his vocal validation of his client. It was unusual to see and hear an 
adviser take such a prominent role and while he was just doing his job, it meant that for many years afterwards, 
much of the business media was not particularly well disposed to him – or him to it.
His developing interest in agribusiness – despite his admission that he knew nothing about agriculture – saw him 
take on a role as a director of Golden Vale (which was later sold to Kerry Group while he was chairman). Again he 
was highly involved in the removal of a chief executive. He proposed the motion to dismiss Jim O’Mahony in July 
1996 and organised the support at board level to get the job done, amid some resentment from Cork and Limerick 
farmers as to the ruthlessness of this posh-sounding elitist figure.
By this stage he had retired as managing partner of A&L Goodbody, although he retained an office at the firm and 
was employed as a consultant. His old connections to Tony Ryan meant that he joined Ryanair as a director in 
1995 and many believe he was essential to the successful stock market flotation of the company in 1997. He 
bought 625,000 shares at the time for just £25,000 and later sold them for over £1 million. There was to be further 
profitable trading in the shares.
He and Michael O’Leary bonded, sharing not just a love of horses, but very similar views as to how businesses 
should be run and on issues of corporate governance and probity. They shared a natural self-confidence and were 
often impatient with others who did not share their views or drive. But he liked that O’Leary was not interested in 
ostentatious displays of wealth or influence. The relationship endured until the time of Osborne’s death; Osborne 
was the senior director at Ryanair and there was never a question of him leaving the board other than at a time of 
his own choosing.
He remained very busy in recent years, partly from financial necessity, partly because he needed the intellectual 
challenge. Some of his investments are understood not to have gone well.
He had backed Fresh Mortgages in 2006, not long before the crash, along with Anglo Irish Bank’s Seán FitzPatrick. 
He was involved with fund manager Pilot View Capital, which required directors’ loans to shore it up after the 
company breached the Central Bank’s capital requirements. It had launched the highly leveraged Atlas fund at the 
peak of the boom in 2007 and incurred heavy losses afterwards. He was chairman of former Irish-listed security, 
cleaning and recruitment company Newcourt when it was put into receivership in mid-2009 by Bank of Ireland after 
failing to restructure its €36 million debt.
But he had a string of other successes to his name, among the various other companies in which he had invested. 
He also made a killing on the property market when he sold Glenbrook, a luxury Georgian mansion on two acres at 
Enniskerry village, just before the market crashed for €6.2 million, which was €2.2 million higher than the asking 
price. The buyer was Shane Ross, now a government minister.
In an Irish Times interview in May 1999, he declared that he had never had a career strategy, but knew he “didn’t 
want to be a lawyer all my life”.
A private memorial service was held for him last Wednesday, and there was then a public event at Trinity College 
last Friday afternoon. He is survived by his wife, Heather, and son and daughter from this marriage, and by his 
partner Patricia Devine and their daughter.

Isme has announced details of its 2017 annual conference which will take place on Friday, November 3.
The conference this year will take place in a new location – the City West Hotel, Dublin – and will have 
enhancements such as breakout sessions, a workshop, panel discussions and more audience interaction.
The title of the conference is What’s Your Story? – Driving Business Growth Through Storytelling, and Isme will be 
asking businesses to look at their own story to see how it can empower them to grow their business.
Commenting on this year’s conference, Isme chief executive Neil McDonnell said: “We received a strong demand 
from last year’s delegates to expand on the idea of ‘selling your story’, so we’ve decided to theme the annual 
conference around it this year. The most successful companies manage to wrap a story around their brand, one 
that instantly communicates their message and values to the customer. We will show how SMEs can do this and be 
just as effective as the big brands.”
Minister Frances Fitzgerald will open the conference, followed by the keynote speech by Michael Cawley, chairman 
of Fáilte Ireland and former deputy chief executive of Ryanair.
Conall Ó Mórain will chair the day, which includes a storytelling workshop led by Cilian Fennell of Stillwater 
Productions.
Other highlights of the conference include John McGrane, director general of the British Irish Chamber of 
Commerce, discussing Brexit, and an interview with Siobhan O’Connor, the managing director of Codex Office 
Solutions, about her business story.
The Great Debate will close the day and includes panellists Lorcan Sirr, Councillor Mannix Flynn, Susan Hayes, Jim 
O’Leary and Tom Lyons, who will hold a discussion on the topic SMEs and New Socialism.
This year’s conference is sponsored by Zurich, Codex Office Solutions and The Sunday Business Post.
Isme announces the line-up for its 2017 conference
Siobhán Lennon, chief executive of The Sunday Business Post, said: “The Sunday Business Post tells the best Irish 
business stories every week. We believe that championing small and medium-sized enterprises is at the heart of 
what we do. We are delighted to be supporting this year’s conference.”
“Zurich, a leading pension provider to SMEs, is delighted to sponsor the conference because we believe in the 
importance to both employers and employees of having a good positive financial story to tell when they reach their 
retirement,” said Joe Creegan, head of corporate life and pensions, Zurich.
Siobhan O’Connor, managing director of Codex Office Solutions, said: “As natural storytellers, small and medium 
enterprises continue to do a great job enhancing their business through networking and communicating, and now 
more than ever this needs to continue.”

Condor among rivals circling assets of insolvent Air Berlin Airlines
Condor among rivals circling assets of insolvent Air Berlin; Airlines

The assets of insolvent Air Berlin are attracting growing interest from rivals as worries grow that the carrier's demise 
might deal a blow to competition and raise prices.
Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, has made clear that it plans to bid for parts of the group and boost its already 
strong position in the German market.
However, Lufthansa is likely to face competition from airlines including Condor, a subsidiary of Thomas Cook.
Condor was expected to bid for a "high double-digit" number of medium-haul planes belonging to Air Berlin, as well 
as some long-haul planes, a person briefed on the negotiations said.
EasyJet, the UK low-cost carrier, has been tipped as a bidder for Air Berlin assets, while a consortium led by 
German businessman Hans Rudolf Wöhrl has said it wants to take over the airline in its entirety.
Air Berlin filed for insolvency this month after Etihad, the Abu Dhabibased airline and the main shareholder in Air 
Berlin, said it would no longer fund the lossmaking carrier.
Over the past six years, Air Berlin has racked up losses of about (EURO)2bn, with net debt reaching (EURO)1.2bn.
In an effort to prevent airport chaos at the height of summer, the government stepped in with a (EURO)150m credit 
line, allowing Air Berlin to stay in operation for another three months.
Condor among rivals circling assets of insolvent Air Berlin Airlines
But the move sparked anger among some rivals, with Ryanair accusing Berlin of a "set-up" to help Lufthansa gain a 
dominant position.
Lufthansa and Air Berlin have a close relationship, following an agreement last year for the latter to run 40 aircraft 
for the flag carrier's subsidiaries.
Analysts point out that a combination of the two German airlines would deal a significant blow to competition, 
especially on domestic flights.
A report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that a full integration of Air Berlin into Lufthansa would create an 
airline with 98 per cent of the market for flights between German cities.

LUFTHANSA has submitted a letter of interest in Air Berlin's Niki unit and other parts of the insolvent carrier, a 
source familiar with the talks said yesterday.
Air Berlin, which is being kept in the air thanks to a (EURO)150m (£138m) government loan, has been in talks with 
interested parties since last week, when it filed for insolvency after major shareholder, Gulf carrier Etihad, said it 
would no longer provide funding.
Part of Air Berlin's appeal to bidders lies in its access to take-off and landing slots at airports such as Dusseldorf, in 
Germany's most populous region.
As part of a restructuring earlier this year, Air Berlin transferred leisure routes to tourist destinations in Spain and 
Greece to its Austria-based unit Niki, founded by former F1 driver Niki Lauda. Analysts at Goodbody said buying 
Niki would strengthen Lufthansa's position against Ryanair on such routes. Lufthansa is unlikely to be able to buy 
all of Air Berlin for competition reasons.

 The European markets ended Wednesday's session in negative territory. 
After snapping a 3-day losing streak on Tuesday, the markets got off to a positive start this morning. However, they 
quickly slid into the red and remained there for the remainder of the session.
Economic data from Europe was positive, with private sector activity maintaining its strong growth momentum in 
August. Traders were concerned by comments made by President Donald Trump at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, on 
Tuesday. Trump pledged to a crowd of supporters that he would build the controversial wall on the border with 
Mexico even if it meant shutting down the government.
Trump also indicated he's likely to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, raising concerns about the 
impact on global trade.
Monetary and regulatory policy actions and steps in supervision undertaken over the last decade have made the 
world more resilient, however, central banks must continue preparing for new challenges, European Central Bank 
President Mario Draghi said Wednesday.
"When the world changes as it did ten years ago, policies, especially monetary policy, need to be adjusted," Draghi 
said in a speech delivered to a gathering of Nobel laureates and economists in Lindau, Germany.
"Such an adjustment, never easy, requires unprejudiced, honest assessment of the new realities with clear eyes, 
unencumbered by the defense of previously held paradigms that have lost any explanatory power."
Draghi is due to speak at the upcoming economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming later this week. 
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is also slated to speak at the event on Friday.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 0.50%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip 
stocks decreased 0.49%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 0.47%.
European Markets Weaken Despite Positive Economic Data
The DAX of Germany dropped 0.45% and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.32%. The FTSE 100 of the UK gained 
0.01%, but the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 0.06%.
In Frankfurt, Air Berlin slid 0.50% after Ryanair said it would be interested in bidding for the whole of the insolvent 
German carrier.
In Paris, advertising and public relations firm Publicis Groupe dropped 3.15% after its British peer WPP cut its full-

Eurozone private sector activity maintained strong growth momentum in August, underpinned by strong expansion 
in the manufacturing output, flash survey data from IHS Markit showed Wednesday.
The flash composite output index rose slightly to 55.8 in August from 55.7 in July. Meanwhile, economists had 
expected the index to fall to 55.4.
Germany's private sector activity expanded at a faster pace in August, as output growth strengthened in both the 
manufacturing and service sectors, flash survey data from IHS Markit showed Wednesday. The composite output 
index climbed to a 2-month high of 55.7 in August from 54.7 in July.
French private sector activity expanded at a marked pace in August, though the rate of growth stagnated, flash 
survey data from IHS Markit showed Wednesday. The composite output index came in at 55.6 in August, the same 
reading as in July.
New home sales in the US unexpectedly saw a substantial decrease in the month of July, according to a report 
released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday. The report said new home sales plunged by 9.4% to an 
annual rate of 571,000 in July from the revised June rate of 630,000.
The steep drop surprised economists, who had expected new home sales to inch up to a rate of 612,000 from the 
610,000 originally reported for the previous month.

Ryanair has joined the airlines outlining preliminary interest in German carrier Air Berlin, which filed for insolvency 
proceedings earlier this month.
The Irish carrier confirm's comments its chief executive Michael O'Leary gave to Reuters yesterday saying the 
airline would be "happy to bid" for Air Berlin. But the airline stresses it would need greater access to Air Berlin's 
financial details to evaluate an offer for the beleaguered airline.
Ryanair has been rapidly growing its presence in the short-haul Germany. FlightGlobal schedules data for August 
shows Ryanair has lifted its Germany capacity by around two-thirds compared with two years ago.
Talks about acquisition of parts of Air Berlin are under way with Lufthansa, tour specialist TUI Group and, 
reportedly, at least one other airline.
German turnaround specialist Intro Group has also signalled its interest, while EasyJet is among others that have 
been linked with looking at the airline.
Germany's government has facilitated a 150 million ($177 million) bridging loan to continue Air Berlin's operations 
until a decision about the airline's estate has been reached.
Ryanair has sharply criticised the process and accused the government of a "conspiracy" to "carve up" Air Berlin for 
the benefit of Lufthansa.
The European Commission confirms it has received a complaint by Ryanair.
Air Berlin began insolvency proceedings earlier this month after key shareholder Etihad Airways, which owns 29% 
of the airline, pulled the plug on further investment in the ailing carrier.

A string of carriers, including Ryanair, have also shown tentative interest in another Etihad part-owned struggling 
carrier, Alitalia. Administrators in the Italian carrier have launched a sale process in pursuit of fresh investment 
generating a number of preliminary submissions of interest. The level of firm interest should become clear after the 
15 September deadline for submitting binding offers.

Everybody is good at something. Air Berlin has shown skill at losing money, doing so at the operating level for eight 
of the past nine years. Last week, Germany's second-largest carrier filed for insolvency after its largest shareholder 
Etihad, the UAE-based carrier, halted financial support.
National champion Lufthansa looks to have the inside track on buying up Air Berlin. Already the former has bought 
planes from Air Berlin, leasing them back, thereby making the flag carrier a creditor. Instead of supporting 
competition, the German government seems to favour consolidation of the market. Great for Lufthansa holders, but 
bad news for consumers.
Air Berlin is likely to be sold in parts.
It has the largest share of passengers at one of the two Berlin airports, Tegel, favoured by business flyers, and at 
busy Düsseldorf.
Lufthansa dominates three other big airports: Frankfurt, Munich and Hamburg. A combination of the two carriers 
would mean Lufthansa controlling half of German airport slots and 90 per cent of the domestic market.
Champion indeed. It could rule the air on domestic pricing. All this upside has put some octane into Lufthansa's 
share price. Already this year, cost cutting, labour dispute settlements and better traffic have boosted its share price 
75 per cent, far ahead of the MSCI European Airlines index.
Germany is Europe's fourth-largest airline market, but one of the least profitable last year, notes consultant RDC. 
One fewer airline only decreases competition for flyers. Irish carrier Ryanair, which managed to snag some slots at 
Air Berlin / Lufthansa : terminal velocity Twitter : @FTLex Email: lex@ft.com
Frankfurt last year, would dearly like to challenge Lufthansa more directly. However, given Lufthansa's front-running 
position, Ryanair and rival easyJet may be lucky to get anything in the sale process.
As poor as Air Berlin has been at running its airline, Lufthansa has shown great élan by positioning itself as the 
favourite for the assets. Let its rivals display their skills as well.

THE COLOURFUL boss of Ryanair said yesterday that he would be keen to make a bid for insolvent airline Air 
Berlin, pending further information on the company's financial situation.
Speaking to Reuters, chief executive Michael O'Leary said: "We would be very happy to bid for the whole of Air 
Berlin, which is generally a short-haul, domestic, intra-EU carrier.
"But we don't know how much restructuring it will take, how much money is it losing, why is it losing so much money 
in a market where we make money."
Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy earlier this month after major shareholder Etihad Airways withdrew funding. The 
carrier is now in talks with a number of aviation firms over its future.
But a German official has said that it is unlikely a direct takeover by one bidder, Lufthansa, will be possible as it 
would make many domestic German routes uncompetitive.

Boeing should continue to adapt the 737 Max product range to help recover parity with Airbus in the single-aisle 
market, Irish lessor and major customer Avolon says in a newly published report.
A reactive product strategy forced Boeing to launch an incomplete 737 Max narrowbody family in 2011 in response 
to the market success of the re-engined A320neo, according to a 10 August “product assessment” of Boeing’s 
single-aisle line by Avolon.
After later launching a 200-seat version of the 737 Max 8 – the Max 200 – redesigning the Max 7 and launching the 
Max 10 to complement the slow-selling Max 9, the family may still not be complete, the lessor argues.
Avolon released the assessment as a “thought leadership” initiative, but has a clear financial interest in the future of 
the programme: it lists commitments for 145 737 Max aircraft, although Boeing’s orders and deliveries data shows 
that only 22 are firm orders.
As a general rule, lessors seek to dissuade aircraft manufacturers from launching too many variants within an 
aircraft family, despite the needs of some airlines for specific performance criteria.
Despite that preference, Avolon applauds the unveiling in June of the 737 Max 10, saying the 1.67m (5.5ft)-
stretched derivative of the Max 9 “strengthens” the family as a “seat-cost machine”. The lessor is similarly 
appreciative of the baseline Max 8 in the heart of the market for keeping a cash operating cost advantage over the 
A320neo.
However, Avolon voices its disappointment with the performance and design of the other three variants, and 
believes Boeing should review its strategies on these. The Max 200, it says, has gained only three customers, 
including launch operator Ryanair; the redesigned Max 7 has failed to compete on a parity basis with the A319neo; 
while the Max 10 “severely” impacts the value proposition of the smaller Max 9.

adaption to better compete with Neo

Even before the Air Berlin estate is divided up, Lufthansa has already nabbed some of the Oneworld carrier's prized 
possessions – market share on important routes to southern Europe.
When Lufthansa Group started introducing 38 wet-leased Air Berlin Airbus A320-family jets to its operations, the 
additional capacity was deployed on routes vacated by Air Berlin.
At the same time, Air Berlin transferred its flights serving southern Europe (except Italy), Turkey and North Africa to 
Austrian subsidiary Niki. This was part of a restructuring effort that involves reduction of Air Berlin's fleet and a 
focus on scheduled services – in particular long-haul flights – from Dusseldorf and the German capital.
The move was, in part, driven by an intent to reduce seasonality in Air Berlin's business. But with the decision, Air 
Berlin departed the leisure market – a segment where it had established its business and brand during the 1990s, 
and which was the basis of its troubled expansion strategy later on. Air Berlin became known as the "Majorca 
Shuttle" in Germany, and opened a base on the Spanish island.
Air Berlin's Mediterranean network August 2016
Following Air Berlin's retreat from Majorca, Eurowings established a base there earlier this year. Eurowings wasn't 
the only airline that targeted the vacated market – Germania, too, opened a station in Majorca, and EasyJet set up 
a seasonal base on the Balearic island.
FlightGlobal schedules data shows that in August 2016 – before Air Berlin's fleet and network reduction plans were 
disclosed in September that year – the airline provided 26.2% of total capacity, in ASK terms, between Germany 
and Spain. Air Berlin shed almost all flights to Spain – bar a route from Dusseldorf to Barcelona – in line with the 
ANALYSIS: How Lufthansa had already targeted Air Berlin routes E Even before the Air Berlin estate is divided

transfer of leisure operations to Niki. But Niki continued operating some 70.4% of Air Berlin's former capacity. In 
August 2017, Niki provided 18.8% of ASK between the two countries.
Overall capacity between Germany and Spain slightly declined during the period.
Meanwhile, Eurowings more than tripled capacity on the routes in question. That growth represents, in part, a 
transfer of capacity from Germanwings to Eurowings, as the former unit's operations are being gradually reduced 
and crewmembers migrate to Lufthansa's mainline. However, Eurowings and Germanwings' combined capacity 
share on routes to Spain still grew 2.4 percentage points to 10.5%.
Lufthansa's mainline separately raised capacity on its routes to the Mediterranean country from Frankfurt and 
Munich, with the carrier's share of overall ASKs rising from 9.2% to 10.2%. Eurowings operates from Munich today, 
but not from Frankfurt.
Other airlines, too, increased capacity in the market segment. Ryanair raised ASKs 21%, with its capacity share 
growing from 12% to 14.7%. Norwegian nearly doubled capacity as part of an effort that included launching flights 
to Spain from Dusseldorf and Hannover. Germania increased ASKs by a third and started operations from 
Nuremberg – a city previously served by Air Berlin.
Air Berlin's European network August 2017
On many routes, Niki replaced Air Berlin with no or few changes, while Eurowings flights succeeded those of 
Germanwings. Niki reduced capacity on several services. Its route between Berlin and Ibiza is a typical example: 
Niki reinstated about two-thirds of Air Berlin's vacated capacity. But on other routes – for example on flights to Las 
Palmas from Cologne and Munich – the Austrian subsidiary added capacity compared with previous Air Berlin 
operations.
There are also vacated Air Berlin routes – particularly from smaller regional airports – that Eurowings has started to 
operate without competition from Niki. Examples include Eurowings' flights to Majorca from Dresden and 
Friedrichshafen.
Eurowings has not replaced Air Berlin (yet), because Niki still operates the majority of its parent's former routes to 
Spain. But Lufthansa has already manoeuvred its budget division to an advanced position in Air Berlin's old leisure 
market – ironically with aircraft and crew wet-leased from the Oneworld carrier – and Eurowings can further expand 
its presence when Air Berlin's remaining business is divided up under the insolvency proceedings.
Niki's role as a custodian of Air Berlin's former leisure routes is relevant – particularly in view of a previous, failed 
attempt to spin the Vienna-based subsidiary off into a separate company. Before Air Berlin transferred routes and 
aircraft to Niki earlier this year, the plan was to merge the Austrian division with tourist specialist TUI Group's 
German-based flight operations to form a new European leisure carrier. TUI and Air Berlin shareholder Etihad 
Airways were set to have stakes in the new business. But the parties disclosed in June a decision to abandon the 
plan. Niki remained an Air Berlin subsidiary – and thus is now up for sale.
And among Air Berlin's assets are routes to another, large market that has so far been spared by the carrier's 
network rejig with Niki, namely Italy. Air Berlin continued operating flights to that market in co-operation with fellow 
Etihad partner Alitalia.

The news should not come as a surprise to many as the Berlin-based carrier had been struggling financially for 
some time already.¬Bloomberg reports that Air Berlin has had to file for insolvency after Etihad, its biggest investor, 
ended financial support.¬Air Berlin had posted net losses in eight of the previous nine years. The German 
government has agreed to keep Air Berlin operational with a Euros 150 million bridge loan for the time being. 
National airline Lufthansa says it is ,Äúsupporting the restricting efforts of the airline jointly with the German 
government.,Äù
,ÄúLufthansa is already in negotiations with the Air Berlin Group to take over parts of Air Berlin. Lufthansa intends 
to conclude these negotiations successfully in due course.,Äù
For its part, Etihad says: ,ÄúThis development is extremely disappointing for all parties especially as Etihad has 
provided¬extensive¬to Air Berlin for its previous liquidity challenges and restructuring efforts over the past six 
years.,Äù
,ÄúAs a minority shareholder, Etihad cannot offer¬funding¬that would further increase our financial exposure. We 
remain open to helping find a commercially viable solution for all parties.We expect Air Berlin operations to continue 
during administration.,Äù
There is a doubt if these¬proceedings go smoothly so or not. Aviation consultant John Strickland says there could 
be problems. He says ,ÄúAir Berlin,Äôs insolvency will be a battle royal. Lufthansa will want control of the market 
capacity while Ryanair will cry foul on market competition grounds.,Äù
If all goes according to plan one would expect Air Berlin to operate its existing network for the time being. But 
changes can be expected once the busy summer period has ended.It is likely that some Air Berlin services will be 
merged with Eurowings, Lufthansa,Äôs budget subsidiary, a few may be taken over by Lufthansa Group airlines 
while others may disappear altogether.
Air Berlin,Äôs CEO Thomas Winkelmann has tweeted a statement on @airberlin to say that its schedules will 
,Äúcontinue as planned and our valid schedule remains valid,Äù.

Tributes have been paid to the highly-respected businessman and lawyer James Osborne who died suddenly last 
Thursday. He was 68.
Osborne was a long-standing director of Ryanair, the chairman of the bookseller Eason and former managing 
partner at A&L Goodbody solicitors where he first made his name having joined upon qualifying from Trinity College 
Dublin in 1973.
He became a managing partner in 1982 when he was just 32.
Julian Yarr, managing partner of A&L Goodbody, said Osborne was a “dear friend and colleague”, adding: “James 
made an exceptional contribution to A&L Goodbody and Irish corporate life”.
“As an individual, he was a hugely positive force and was held in the highest esteem by everyone he worked with 
through the years. We send our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends at this very sad time.”
A spokesman for Ryanair said, “The Board and people of Ryanair express their deepest sympathy to the family and 
friends of James Osborne, who served as a director of Ryanair for the past 21 years, on his untimely passing. He 
will be greatly missed by all who knew him. May he rest in peace.”
He also served as chairman of Independent News and Media (INM) between 2011 and 2012 when a battle between 
shareholders Denis O’Brien and Tony O’Reilly became increasingly fraught.
O’Brien voted Osborne off the board at INM in June 2012.
Osborne famously closed the meeting where he was forced out by saying: “And that concludes the annual general 
meeting of the not-so-Independent News and Media.”
James Osborne 1949-2017
In subsequent interview with the Sunday Independent he reflected: “I don't think I was either pro-O'Reilly or pro-
O'Brien, or anti O'Reilly or anti-O'Brien. I took a view on what needed to be done in the business and I believe that 
was the right view. It was quite difficult to persuade some of my directors that this was the right thing to do, but as to 
how independent they will be, we will wait and see.”
His corporate career saw him sit on the boards of Carrolls Holdings, Golden Vale and Adare.
He was due to convene the Eason annual general meeting next month.
“Managing director Liam Hanly, the board and the staff of Eason would like to express our gratitude to an 
exceptional friend and colleague. Our sympathies and condolences are with his family and friends at this time,” 
Eason said in a statement.
Osborne is survived by his partner Patricia Devine and their young daughter as well as two adult children from an 
earlier marriage.

Highlight: After nearly 50 years at the top of Irish business, it’s his involvement with the Olympic Council of Ireland 
that now drives the former Aer Lingus boss 
Body
Colm Barrington has almost half a century under his belt in Irish business. In 1968 he was 21 years old, fresh out of 
UCD with a Master’s degree in economics and he was offered a job with oil company BP.
He took it – it was, after all, the late 1960s, and jobs weren’t exactly in abundance – but things were slightly different 
for him. He had another job offer within two weeks: from Aer Lingus.
He decided to make the move. “Basically because Aer Lingus, to give it its due, was one of the few Irish companies 
at the time that was outward-looking, by Irish standards,” he says.
Barrington started off in the company’s economic planning group, doing route analysis, before moving to the US to 
work on the company’s hotels arm. By that time he had morphed from a young graduate to a young executive, 
married with two children who had been born in the US.
It was that young executive who ran into Tony Ryan, the founder of Ryanair, in the Pottery Bar at the Hibernia Hotel 
in Dublin.
Ryan asked him when he was coming back to Ireland to work with Guinness Peat Aviation, Ryan’s aircraft leasing 
business.
“And I said ‘Tony, you couldn’t afford me’,” he recalls. “That was a red rag to Tony, because he felt he could afford 
anybody. So, after nine months of negotiation, I came back and joined GPA and spent 13 years there.”
That company was bought out by the giant US investment firm GE Capital, soon after which Barrington left to set up 
his own aircraft leasing firm, Babcock & Brown, which was floated on the stock exchange ten years ago.

These days, he plies his trade as the chief executive of Fly Leasing, one of the leading companies in an 
increasingly booming aircraft finance industry in Ireland.
But Barrington is no single-industry man. He has a broad sweep of experience, from Eircom to the Dublin Airport 
Authority to his various directorships with IFG Group, Hibernia, Finnair, and his vice-presidency of the Olympic 
Council of Ireland.
He is currently chief executive at Fly Leasing. A lifelong sailor, he still holds the course record in the Round Ireland 
Yacht Race.
His success as an experienced Irish executive became something of a double-edged sword when shareholders in 
Hibernia – where he is a non-executive director – were urged by a proxy body to vote against him, arguing that he 
was spread too thinly across directorships.
And while Barrington holds his counsel on the Hibernia vote, it is contrary to his typical forthright approach.
Barrington will probably be remembered by history as the last chairman of an independent Aer Lingus. The former 
national carrier has gone from strength to strength, so it’s easy to forget just how controversial the sale was at the 
time. Not Barrington, though.
In fact, he had seen this eventuality coming from a long way off.
“Our view was that, in the long run, Aer Lingus probably had to be part of a larger group,” he says. “Because the 
role of small independent airlines in the world is receding.
“We did various studies and research on what would be the best partner of Aer Lingus, and had come to the 
conclusion some time before that IAG was the best partner for Aer Lingus.”
For Barrington and his fellow directors, through Aer Lingus, Dublin Airport could effectively become the third 
Heathrow runway, bringing people from Scotland and England through the continent and to the US.
At that time, though, IAG was not an interested bidder. Ryanair was, but Barrington was not impressed.
“First of all, the Ryanair price wasn’t ever acceptable. Secondly, Ryanair’s bid was never going to be accepted by 
European competition authority unless Ryanair did what it was proposing to do – in its third and final bid – which 
was to effectively eviscerate Aer Lingus’s European operations.
“The only way Ryanair would have got competition was effectively to close down Aer Lingus’s short-haul 
operations. So we rejected the deal on the basis that we couldn’t succeed. But we never got to reject it on the basis 
of our price, which would have been our next step.”
Why, in Barrington’s view, did Ryanair even make a bid, given that the competition issue was so significant? “I’d say 
it’s mischievous as anything else,” he deadpans.
Nevertheless, it was not an easy ride. “It was very damaging to our interests. I mean, I took over as chairman in 
October 2007, and we got our second round of bidding in November,” he says.
It meant part of the company’s attention was focused on the bid when it ought to have been focused elsewhere.
“In early 2008, we found we were entering the summer season with too much capacity on the wrong routes,” says 
Barrington. “So my own view is that the second Ryanair bid probably cost Aer Lingus and its shareholders at least 
€100 million – maybe €150 million – because it took the eye off the ball.
[caption id="attachment_395774" align="alignright" width="391"] Colm Barrington: ‘We’re a relatively small country, 
but we’re a relatively rich country’ Picture: Bryan Meade[/caption]
“So that was pretty stressful, all right. And it cost us the chief executive.”

Barrington declines to go any further, pleading that to do so would breach extant confidentiality agreements, but he 
is presumably referring to Dermot Mannion, who faced a great degree of shareholder unease after the first two 
Ryanair bids, and who was replaced with Christoph Mueller, who faced down a third Ryanair bid.
And so, on to the next bid: IAG.
“Literally, shortly after [getting the company’s pension problems resolved], we got a call from the head of the IAG 
saying could we talk? And then he and Willie Walsh came to Dublin, and Christoph and I met them, and they gave 
us a letter of offer.”
Barrington and his fellow directors reckoned that the intention was right, but the price was wrong, so there ensued a 
period of shadow-boxing over the price.
“The problem is, none of those valuations are ever terribly precise. There’s always a range,” he says.
To avoid the situation in which a target company is (in his words) bidding against itself, they tend to avoid giving a 
direct price. Instead, it’s all shuttle diplomacy and sotto voce indications.
“They have their investment bank, as we in Ireland have our investment bankers,” he says. “That sort of back-of-
the-room chat.”
Eventually, on the third price – which had risen from €2.30 to €2.55, compared to Ryanair’s 2012 offer of €1.30 – 
Barrington and his board concluded they had got an acceptable offer. But acceptance by the board does not mean 
the deal is over the line. It still has to go to the shareholders. And, more than most companies, Aer Lingus’s share 
register was a strange beast.
Two rival airlines had stakes, with Ryanair on around 30 per cent and Etihad sitting on a couple of per cent. The 
employees had 10 per cent. The Irish state held a portion of shares. And the rest was made up by institutional 
investors.
“We weren’t really a plc at all,” says Barrington. “We were sort of a tightly held company, like many other Irish plcs, 
which made it very difficult for the board, who had to look after the interests of the shareholders and the company 
because they were all quite different.”
And then there was the politics.
“The unions thought having a government shareholder would help their position, in terms of negotiations 
commitments with them. And the government, in my seven years of experience of being there, actually behaved 
very responsibly and never put undue pressure on the airline, in terms of industrial relations issues. They obviously 
heard their opinion on things like services in and out of Shannon and so on, but they always behaved very, very 
properly.”
All of which produced a stress of its own, not least when Barrington and his chief executive Stephen Kavanagh – 
who had replaced Mueller in early 2015 – came before the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee to explain the 
rationale for the sale. Barrington’s distaste is still palpable today.
“It wasn’t gruelling,” he says. “It was pathetic, rather than gruelling. You could answer the questions easily. But the 
questions weren’t to point. They weren’t on why Aer Lingus should be doing this, why is it good for Aer Lingus, good 
for its employees, good for its shareholders, good for the company, you know. It was all to do with very limited 
sectional things.”
As with all flag carriers, it was part emotional decision, part commercial, and it’s clear that Barrington felt it was the 
best way for Aer Lingus to survive in a changing market.
“In some ways, it was a pang of regret,” he says. “In some ways it was sort of a pang of satisfaction.”
This sporting life: Colm Barrington
Today, Aer Lingus is going from strength to strength as a partly independent business within the wider IAG group. 
Meanwhile, its one-time rival, Ryanair, is surging ahead in no uncertain terms.
One could forgive Barrington for having some lingering resentment over the mega-aggressive approach that 
Ryanair and its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, took during its failed efforts to buy Aer Lingus. Perhaps 
unsurprisingly, Barrington is quite complimentary of O’Leary and his airline – if a little pointed, too.
“I’ve travelled Ryanair recently. And I must say, the service is not bad at all. The staff are much more pleasant than 
they used to be. They still [have] the yellow [colour scheme]; it’s a bit jarring. And the horns still go off [when a plane 
lands]. But I think it’s a bit better.”
Indeed, he’s positively glowing in his compliments for O’Leary, who has virtually single-handedly built Ryanair into a 
European airline powerhouse.
[caption id="attachment_395775" align="alignright" width="1024"] Tony Ryan, former owner and founder of Ryanair, 
hired Barrington for Guinness Peat Aviation in 1979[/caption]
The joke about Ryanair, Barrington says, referring to a conversation he once had with another airline chief 
executive, was that while most airlines make the most money from their last passenger, Ryanair works to make 
sure it doesn’t get the last passenger.
But while that’s the joke, the evidence doesn’t bear it out. “If you read their load factors these days, they are in the 
90 per cent range in January, February and early March. I mean, they’re doing remarkably well,” Barrington says.
And the future is secure, too, he says, arguing that there’ll be no post-O’Leary crisis in Ryanair in the way there was 
a post-Jobs crisis in Apple.
“Companies need different people at different times,” he says. “Ryanair needed Michael when it was actually 
scrabbling to get the payroll every week. Now it’s an up-and-running organisation that keeps the systems going and 
then keeps a very tight rein on the costs,” he says.
O’Leary has helped to bring in a whole new generation of executives such as Kenny Jacobs who could, Barrington 
believes, easily do the job as well as him.
The question now is one of where Ryanair builds its growth. Having missed out on picking up Aer Lingus’s 
transatlantic network at a snip, will the airline ever really start flying to the US?
“The reasons for not going transatlantic are bullshit,” says Barrington. “They say they can’t get appropriate aircraft 
without advice. It’s nonsense. I mean, my business is aircraft leasing, and there are plenty of wide body aircraft if 
that’s what they want.
“I think it’s very difficult to be truly low-cost on the Atlantic because so much of your expense is your aircraft and 
your fuel and your points at the end, whereas on short haul you can keep your staff costs lower, and your airport 
costs lower, or at a more significant part of your total cost.
“I’m not saying it doesn’t work, it just doesn’t work as well on long-haul as it does on short-haul.”
And, of course, O’Leary is no fool – he’s not going to throw away money if he’s not guaranteed a profit.
“He’s so far away from being a fool it’s unbelievable,” says Barrington. “He may act one, but he’s certainly not a 
fool.”
Last year, Barrington was elected first vice-president – that is to say, one of the two vice-presidents – of the 
Olympic Council of Ireland.
This sporting life: Colm Barrington
“I’ve been absolutely disgusted with the way we were treated by the Olympic Council of Ireland,” he says, attributing 
it to the fact that Richard Burrows, who is a sailor, ran against Pat Hickey for the post of OCI president some years 
ago.It meant that when Hickey stepped down, Barrington saw a chance to sweep a new broom through the OCI 
board.“I wouldn’t have had time to become president, even if I had wanted to. So I gave my full support to Sarah 
Keane, and we got a team of candidates together and we put in effectively a block candidacy. And we all got 
elected. The 11 of us who went up got elected by pretty significant majorities.”
The question now is how to clean out Irish sport’s own version of the Augean Stables.Barrington is understandably 
keen not to focus unduly on the Moran report or the arrest of Pat Hickey in Rio and the ensuing coverage of the 
Brazilian ticket touting investigation. There were other problems, he points out, and bigger problems for the OCI’s 
management.
“There was huge publicity over the tickets, but it was a relatively minor issue. Taking the case of sailing: the 
Olympic village was about an hour and a half commute from the sailing centre. We said to the OCI: ‘We can’t have 
our young people commuting backwards and forwards. How could anyone have the chance to be successful while 
doing that commute every day?’ So we needed accommodation by the sailing centre. The OCI said: ‘Sorry, you’re 
on your own on that.’ So it cost us €24,000 to hire apartments near the sailing centre.
“Then there were logistics, getting the boats and equipment out. The OCI said: ‘They’re leaving on July 7.’ We said: 
‘Sorry, we need our kids on the water on July 1.’ So we had to pay another twenty-something grand.“On 
accreditations, we tried to [get them for] our team management, our coaches, our athletes, our doctors, our physio. 
The OCI said: ‘Sorry, we can only have so many accreditations’.”
[caption id="attachment_395778" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Pat Hickey, former OCI president[/caption]
The fallout from Rio continues to bedevil the preparations for Tokyo 2020.“I mean, Rio is costing a fortune,” says 
Barrington. “I signed off yesterday on over €100,000 of legal bills related to one of the old board, for the advice that 
this person recieved for the Moran Tribunal [the inquiry into the ticket touting affair]. Over €100,000 we’ve had to 
pay.
“As I said to somebody the other day: ‘We don’t even know where the cupboards are, let alone what skeletons are 
in them yet.’ So that’s going nowhere, and it’s cost us a fortune.”
Meanwhile, they have to continue the business of preparing their athletes for Tokyo.“I think we’ve got 12 
scholarships for young athletes who are competing now for the next Olympics,” he says. “These all come from the 
Olympic International Committee, which is unbelievable. They have more than 600 people. I don’t know what their 
budget is, hundreds of millions. And they give us a good grant every year, and they provide other scholarships and 
what they call Olympic solidarity grants and things. So we’re now really focused on getting all of those we can and 
passing them along.”
Such funding is vital for them right now, because as Barrington puts it: “Sponsorship’s an issue for us now because 
we’re somewhat toxic until we get the whole Rio thing sorted. But we’ll work on that over the next year.”Barrington 
is unabashed in his hunger for medals.“We’re a relatively small country, but we’re a relatively rich country. We’re 
sports-mad, but we’re sports-diverse. We’ve got hurling, football, rugby, Gaelic football, hurling, horseracing, 
cycling, tennis, cricket, hockey. We play every sport in the world. Whereas countries like Denmark are much more 
focused.”
This can mean that Ireland’s athletic and Olympic success is somewhat constrained. Barrington, typically, is more 
blunt. “Our success [rate] in the Olympics is awful. We got two silver medals in the last Olympics. I think we’re the 
65th country on the Olympics medals tables.”
I point out that by other metrics – say, personal bests by Irish athletes – the trend line is actually rising. That cuts no 
ice with Barrington.“The personal best I don’t regard as being a good measure. It’s good for the athlete, but it 
doesn’t help the country as such. You know, okay, it’s great that someone can go to the Olympics and achieve their 
personal best. But that personal best isn’t as good enough as 20 other athletes.”
This sporting life: Colm Barrington
But isn’t it a sign of real development?“It’s a good level of achievement. But, again, I’ve always been an 
internationalist. An example: Annalise Murphy getting her silver medal has had a hugely positive impact on young 
people in Ireland, and particularly girls.”He acknowledges he’s being somewhat reductive, and that plenty of world-
class Irish athletes have never won a medal. They are still Olympians of the first class, he says, but medals are the 
goal.
“You know, I was a sailor and I never got to the Olympic Games,” he says. “So I fully understand that. But on the 
other hand, you know, there are people out there who are the best in the world, and we should be trying to get 
some of the best in the world and helping them get there.
So how many medals can Ireland realistically win?“I would certainly hope they would be getting up into double 
figures if we do things right over the next three or four Olympic cycles.”
 
In his nearly 50 years in Irish business, Barrington has seen it all: mergers, acquisitions, recessions, Tiger 
economies and all sorts of government prescriptions to fix or improve the economy. It gives him a good perspective 
on what Ireland’s been through over the last decade.
“We never should have guaranteed that bank debt. The government should not have paid off that bank debt. That 
was bondholders, who made bad decisions,” he says, pointing out that he had money on deposit with Anglo Irish 
Bank in 2002, but withdrew it because he felt they were “a one-trick pony”.
“If I, as an ignorant person, could do that 15 years ago, how come a German bondholder couldn’t do it? And why 
am I now being forced to pay higher taxes to pay that?”
He acknowledges that while the bank bailout remains a serious contributor to Ireland’s current problems, it’s partly 
ancient history. What can be done now?
“I think we’ve done reasonably well, considering the levels of debt and considering where we were in 2008 and 
2009,” he says. “But we’ve got to stay competitive, and if we start going now trying to get back to where we were in 
2004, in terms of payroll and so on, we just can’t afford it.
“I don’t believe we had a period of austerity. I believe we had a period of reality. We were just over the top. I think 
we’ve got to retain reality for the timebeing and stay competitive.
“I really think we have a serious issue. We have too much debt, we can’t be flathúileach in our expenditure while we 
have that debt. We’ve got to get our current account into order. And if we’d had our current account in order before, 
then we could have told everyone to go bugger off.
“But because we needed to continue to borrow it, we had to go along with it. And, y’know, if you’re not living within 
your means, then you’re in trouble.”
Sponsorship’s an issue for [the OCI] now because we’re somewhat toxic until we get the whole Rio thing sorted. 
But we’ll work on that over the next year
Is it possible for Ireland to do that, really? Will we always effectively be a client state of other countries and of other 
corporations?
“Well, small countries can be self-sufficient,” says Barrington. “We’re coming from a bad place. We’ve had 50 years 
of economic stagnation so it’s only in relatively recent times [that the economy has been strong].
“We don’t have an industrial infrastructure like Switzerland that’s been built over decades. But we are building up 
pretty good industry in Ireland now. But we mustn’t kill the golden goose before the golden debt is paid off.”
Unsurprisingly for a lifelong businessman, he believes efficiency is the key.
This sporting life: Colm Barrington
“My big thing is efficiency. Because if you’re efficient, you can afford to pay people now. But if you’re inefficient, you 
can’t afford to pay people. So I’m a believer in efficiency and having a relatively good compensation.”
Efficiency, in corporate terms, means cutting costs and jobs.
“Or growing the business into them,” says Barrington. “But, again, people shouldn’t be so concerned in this day and 
age – particularly now the way the economy is going – about being got rid of, because there are other opportunities 
out there.
“So if you work these things properly, and you know people aren’t so narrowly focused that they think they can only 
work as, let’s say, a porter in the Mater Hospital. There are actually other jobs out there, and they may actually offer 
them better jobs and better pay, you know, if they get their minds open to doing it.”
Still, efficiency in national terms is a lot more complex and indeed emotionally charged. The state isn’t a commercial 
business, I point out.
“I know,” Barrington says. “That’s the problem.”

Air Berlin became the second large European airline to go bankrupt this summer after it was forced to file for 
insolvency on Tuesday when its biggest shareholder pulled its funding.
Germany's second-largest carrier was saved from a full collapse after Berlin stepped in with a (EURO)150m loan to 
keep the airline flying through the busy summer months while it negotiated the sale of parts of the business to 
Lufthansa and one other airline.
The move was triggered when Etihad, the Abu Dhabibased airline that owns 29 per cent of Air Berlin, decided not to 
pump in any more money after providing a series of cash injections over the past six years to keep it afloat.
Air Berlin's insolvency comes just four months after Alitalia, the Italian carrier, entered administration after its 
employees rejected a restructuring plan and Etihad, which also owns a significant stake in Alitalia, said it would 
provide no more funding.
Air Berlin has been under pressure after racking up losses of about (EURO)2bn over the past six years. The 
situation has worsened as Etihad has faced its own challenges, forcing it to unravel its strategy of buying minority 
stakes in airlines to drive traffic to its hub in the Gulf. Etihad made losses of $1.9bn in 2016.
Air Berlin's collapse has sparked a fierce battle over the rights to prime German take-off and landing slots, with 
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, branding a state bailout of the airline as a "conspiracy" to protect national 
carrier Lufthansa.

 Stocks ended lower on Friday, as further troubles with US President Donald Trump's administration and two 
terrorist attacks in Spain led to a major risk-off sentiment among investors. 
The FTSE 100 index closed down 1.0%, or 72.46 points, at 7,315.41. The blue-chip index ended the week up 0.2%. 
The FTSE 250 ended down 0.8%, or 156.42 points, at 19,616.66, and up 0.5% for the week as a whole. The AIM 
All-Share closed down 0.3%, or 2.66 points, at 999.66, up 1.0% for the week. 
The BATS UK 100 ended down 0.9% at 12,453.19, the BATS 250 closed down 0.8% at 17,826.03, and the BATS 
Small Companies ended 0.3% lower at 12,158.79.
The number of people killed in two terrorist attacks in Spain rose to 14, after a woman died from injuries sustained 
in a car-ramming incident in Cambrils, emergency services said Friday. Thirteen people were killed in Barcelona 
when a van rammed into people in the pedestrian area of Las Ramblas, a tourist hotspot in the centre of town. More 
than 100 others were injured.
The Islamic State group said via its affiliated Amaq news agency that its "soldiers" were responsible for the attack.
Travel and tourism-related stocks were hit in the wake of the terrorist attack, and whilst they regained some ground 
throughout the day, still ended among the worst performers. 
International Consolidated Airlines Group closed as the worst performer, down 3.1%. IAG, which owns British 
Airways and Aer Lingus, has high exposure to Spain via Iberia and Vueling, a low-cost airline based in Barcelona. 
IAG also owns Level, a low-cost long-haul airline, also based in the Catalan capital.
Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings closed down 1.5%, whilst peer easyJet ended down 0.7%. Hotel operator 
InterContinental Hotels Group closed down 1.6%.

Across the pond, US House of Representatives Leader Nancy Pelosi led a call by Democratic lawmakers to remove 
Confederate statues on display in the halls of Congress. The Democrats rejected President Donald Trump's 
criticism of the removal of "beautiful" Confederate statues.
The heated nationwide debate over the removal of monuments to the Confederacy reached Capitol Hill Thursday 
when Pelosi called on House Speaker Paul Ryan to start the process for removing memorials for leaders of the 
Confederacy. The removal of a statue of Robert E Lee had led to deadly clashes between white nationalists and 
protesting crowds in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend.
Trump had drawn fire for not speaking out forcefully enough against white supremacists in the wake of violence at 
the rally in Charlottesville that left one woman dead. 
Eight members of the President's American Manufacturing Council - including the chief executives of Dow 
Chemical, Intel, Merck, 3M, Johnson &amp; Johnson and United Technologies - have resigned since Sunday over 
the issue, while all members of the Strategic &amp; Policy Forum agreed to quit the group Wednesday. 
This has led to ongoing concerns among investors about Trump's ability to implement his pro-business agenda. 
Upon his inauguration as US president, Trump initially said he would ramp up infrastructure spending in the US. 
Among the blue-chip decliners in London were equipment rental company Ashtead, closing down 2.8%, and 
building materials group CRH, closing down 1.8%. Both companies have significant exposure to the US 
construction market. 
"Trump's decision to disband the advisory council on infrastructure has put a dent in their share prices. Both stocks 
were given a boost by the election of Trump as he pledged to ramp up spending on infrastructure, but now traders 
are getting out of their positions on the back of recent developments," said IG Group analyst David Madden.
At the other end of the large-cap index, Randgold Resources ended as the best performer, up 1.7%, as the sell-off 
in equities led to a rise in the gold price, with investors moving back to 'safe-haven' assets. Fellow gold miner 
Acacia Mining was the best mid-cap performer, closing up 6.5%.
The precious metal was quoted at USD1,289.67 an ounce against USD1,284.32 a the London equities close on 
Thursday. Gold hit an intraday high of USD1,300.70, a level it has not seen since November 2016.
"The decline in global equities has helped the demand for gold as it is deemed to be a safe haven asset. On risk-off 
days is it not surprising to see funds flow out of stocks and into gold. The dip in the US dollar today also helped the 
metal. It is interesting that gold took out the June high of USD1,296, because this could be the start of a leg higher. 
After all, traders are not worried about an interest rate hike from the Fed in the next few months," Madden said. 
In Paris the CAC 40 ended down 0.6%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended down 0.3%. 
On a light day in the global economic calendar, the pound was quoted at USD1.2846 at the London equities close 
Friday, compared to USD1.2884 at the same time on Thursday. The euro stood at USD1.1740 at the European 
equities close, against USD1.1741 the prior day.
Stocks in New York were mixed at the London equities close. The DJIA was down 0.2%, the S&amp;P 500 index 
was flat and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.2%.
"Markets have extended their losses this afternoon in the UK and Europe, but in the US declines have slowed 
markedly, while this year's most crowded trade, the Nasdaq, is actually eking out some gains. The classic 
symptoms of August markets have been seen – lack of news, an abundance of rumour, and low volumes. Given 
that the previous three weeks had been some of the most quiet in the post-war history of the S&amp;P 500, it is not 
surprising to see volatility that would, in 2016, have been considered run of the mill, being the occasion for 
heightened nervousness, if not outright panic," said IG analyst Chris Beauchamp.

 Stocks in London were lower on Friday morning, with tourism-related stocks heavily hit as investors digest the 
news of a terrorist attack in Barcelona late Thursday.
International Consolidated Airlines Group was down 3.2%, while easyJet was 3.1% lower, the worst two blue-chip 
performers in early trade. 
IAG - the owner of British Airways and Irish airline Aer Lingus - also owns Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling, a 
low-cost airline based in Barcelona. IAG also owns Level, a low-cost long-haul airline, also based in the Spanish 
city. 
InterContinental Hotels Group was down 1.4%, while cruise operator Carnival was down 1.2%.
FTSE 250-listed air carrier Wizz Air Holdings was down 1.7%, while fellow mid-cap travel operator Thomas Cook 
was down 1.9%. Ryanair Holdings was down 2.2%.
Transport firm National Express Group was the worst mid-cap performer, down 2.7%. 
A van crashed into a crowd of people in Las Ramblas, on one of Barcelona's busiest thoroughfares, with local 
media reporting at least 13 people had been killed in what police said was a terrorist attack.
Two people had already been arrested. Spanish police have arrested a third suspect after the deadly van attack in 
Barcelona, newspaper El Pais reported Friday, citing the Catalan interior ministry.
It is not known whether the driver of the van was the latest person arrested, as this person is still believed on the 
run.
Hours after the attack on the Las Ramblas, police said they had killed five suspects who tried to mow down 
pedestrians in the town of Cambrils.

USD1,293.60 an ounce compared to USD1,284.32 at the London equities close Thursday. Midcap peer Hochschild

FTSE 100 - LOSERS----------International Consolidated Airlines, down 2.5%, easyJet, down 2.2%, InterContinental 
Hotels, down 2.1%, Carnival, down 1.8%. The travel and leisure stocks were lower in wake of the terrorist attack in 
Barcelona late Thursday. A van crashed into a crowd of people in Las Ramblas, on one of Barcelona's busiest 
thoroughfares, with local media reporting at least 13 people had been killed in what police said was a terrorist 
attack. IAG owns Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling, a low-cost airline based in Barcelona. IAG also owns Level, a

shipments have attracted higher royalty rates of 6%, up from 4% previously, and a clearing fee of 1% has been

licences all in Tanzania, maintained that its full-year gold production forecast remains unchanged at between 80,00 
to 85,000 ounces, "albeit towards the lower end" of guidance due to the exclusion of the Singida pilot plant 
production. Shanta also said it has terminated its deal to buy Canada-based Helio, which owns the SMP gold 
project in Tanzania in the Lupa gold field adjacent to Shanta's New Luika mine, due to the potential impact of the 
legislative changes in Tanzania on Helio.

 Stocks in London were lower on Friday at midday, with travel stocks leading the fallers following two terrorist 
attacks in Barcelona on Thursday, while sentiment was also dampened by weak trading in New York as investors 
seem to be losing patience with US President Donald Trump.
The FTSE 100 index was down 0.9%, or 69.19 points at 7,318.68. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was down 0.9% at 
19,601.03, and the AIM All-Share index was down 0.4% at 998.54.
The BATS UK 100 index was down 1.0% at 12,439.68. The BATS 250 was down 0.9% at 17,800.02. The BATS 
Small Companies was down 0.3% at 12,153.23.
Spanish police have arrested a third person in connection with the Barcelona terrorist attack that killed at least 13 
people and injured more than 100 others on Thursday. The attacker struck a bustling commercial area of Barcelona 
popular with local and tourists, killing and injuring people of at least 20 nationalities, Catalonia authorities said.
It was unclear if the person arrested was the driver of the van who fled after ploughing into the busy Las Ramblas 
thoroughfare on Thursday evening. The man was taken into custody in the town of Ripoll, about 100 kilometres 
north of Barcelona, police said Friday.
Two people linked to the attack were arrested shortly after the vehicle rampage took place. Catalan police said one 
was a Moroccan and the other a Spanish national from the North African Spanish enclave of Melilla. Neither were 
known to have any previous links to terrorism.
The Islamic State group said via its affiliated Amaq news agency that its "soldiers" were responsible for the attack.
Hours after the first incident, police said they killed five alleged terrorists who tried to mow down pedestrians in the 
Catalan resort town of Cambrils, about 100 kilometres south-west of Barcelona.

Local media said the attackers drove off after police tried to carry out a check, aiming at pedestrians as they went. 
The police gave chase, the vehicle then overturned and the men were shot dead as they tried to flee. The suspects 
were wearing fake explosives belts, Catalan police said on Twitter.
Tourism and travel-related stocks were heavily hit on Friday as investors digested the news from Spain. 
International Consolidated Airlines Group was down 2.0%, while easyJet was 1.4% lower. 
IAG - the owner of British Airways and Irish airline Aer Lingus - also owns Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling, a 
low-cost airline based in Barcelona. IAG also owns Level, a low-cost long-haul airline, also based in the Spanish 
city.
FTSE 250-listed air carrier Wizz Air Holdings was down 2.3%, while Ryanair Holdings was down 1.6%
"Unsurprisingly we are seeing the airlines leading the FTSE 100 lower this morning. In London, Paris and now 
Barcelona, the terrorist attacks over recent years have taken place in the three most visited cities in Europe, with 
inevitable implications for numbers over the coming year. With Turkish tourism numbers finally coming back, the 
focus on top European cities will arguably be a bigger hit to low cost European carriers if people decide to stay 
away," said IG analyst Joshua Mahony. 
InterContinental Hotels Group was down 1.4%. FTSE 250-listed transport firm National Express Group was down 
2.1%, while fellow mid-cap travel operator Thomas Cook was down 1.5%. 
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 index in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt were down 1.1% and 0.6%, 
respectively. 
Stocks in the US were pointed for a marginally higher open on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 
the S&amp;P 500 index seen flat, and the Nasdaq Composite pointed 0.1% higher.
The three major New York stock indices suffered heavy declines on Thursday, with the DJIA ending down 1.2%, the 
S&amp;P down 1.5% and the Nasdaq down 1.9%.
"The optimism of this week appears to have faded, with the prospect of an even tougher environment for Donald 
Trump bringing into doubt the likeliness of any tangible policies in the near future," noted IG's Mahony. 
"While the week started well, we are now seeing widespread selling for global stocks, with traders instead choosing 
to shift their focus towards the likes of gold and the yen. News that Trump has disbanded an industrial committee 
before it had even been full formed says it all, with businesses turning their back on the President en masse," the 
analyst said.
Trump has decided not to assemble an infrastructure advisory council as planned, US news reports said. The goal 
of the Advisory Council on Infrastructure was to advise Trump on his plan to propose spending billions of dollars 
upgrading roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure. 
Shares in Ashtead Group were down 1.9%. The equipment rental firm is greatly exposed to the US via its Sunbelt 
Rentals business. 
The news came one day after Trump announced he was disbanding two other business advisory councils as 
several corporate chief executives resigned from them in protest over Trump's remarks on violence that broke out 
Saturday at a demonstration by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Gold was quoted at USD1,295.19 an ounce at midday, higher than USD1,284.32 an ounce at the London equities 
close on Thursday. FTSE 100-listed Randgold Resources was the biggest blue-chip gainer, up 1.1%.
RSA Insurance was another gainer in the FTSE 100, up 1.2%, after RBC Capital upgraded the firm to Outperform 
from Sector Perform.
LONDON MARKET MIDDAY: Barcelona Terror Attack, Trump Hit Risk Appetite
Still in the economic calendar on Friday, in the US, the Michigan consumer sentiment index is at 1500 BST, while 
the Baker Hughes oil rig count is at 1800 BST.
Released earlier in the day, Data from Destatis showed German producer prices for industrial products advanced 
2.3% year-on-year in July, slightly weaker than the 2.4% increase seen in June. This was the weakest since 
December, when prices gained 1%. Economists had forecast 2.2% annual increase.
Month-on-month, producer prices gained 0.2% after staying flat in June. Prices were forecast to remain unchanged 
in July.
The euro area current account surplus declined to the lowest in nearly three years in June, the European Central 
Bank said. The current account surplus fell to EUR21.2 billion in June from EUR30.5 billion in May. This was the 
lowest level since August 2014.
The surplus on trade in goods rose to EUR27.4 billion in June from EUR 26.6 billion. Meanwhile, the surplus on 
services declined to EUR2.2 billion from EUR2.7 billion.

European travel stocks fell sharply in early trading on Friday after a deadly attack in tourist hotspot Barcelona, with 
investors also increasingly concerned the Trump administration was fraying at the seams.
As a global sell-off spread, the pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.9% by 0725 GMT, with blue-chips down 1%, 
following falls in Asian and U.S. stocks overnight.
Travel and leisure stocks led sector losers, down 1.4%, with airlines the worst-performing as investors dropped 
stocks exposed to tourist flows.
Easyjet, Ryanair, British Airways owner IAG and Lufthansa were down 2.3 to 3.2%.
Spanish airport company AENA fell 2% after Thursday'a attack, in which a suspected Islamist militant drove a van 
into crowds in central Barcelona, killing 13 people.
The risk-off moves also hit banks, down 1.2%, with Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas among the worst performers.
Though company news was thin on the ground, earnings drove some moves.
Dutch storage firm Vopak fell 4.5% after it said profit would be 5 to 10% lower this year than last due to lower 
occupancy rates.
Fiat Chrysler fell 1.5% after Guangzhou Automobile denied it was planning to take over the Italian carmaker. 
Speculation over a potential Chinese buyer sent its shares soaring this week.
The European earnings season was drawing to a close, with 86% of second-quarter company reports through.

Some 60% of these have beaten or met expectations, and earnings estimates were trending up, though they were 
still negative overall after being revised down sharply since the start of earnings season due to concerns about a 
stronger euro. (Reuters)

Ryanair sees any plans by Lufthansa to take over parts of insolvent rival Air Berlin as a "conspiracy" to halt the Irish 
carrier's expansion, its chief executive told Reuters.
Air Berlin on Tuesday filed for insolvency after shareholder Etihad said it would not provide more funding, turning to 
the German government for a 150 million euro loan to keep planes in the air while it negotiates a sale of parts of its 
business to Lufthansa and one other airline.
Ryanair has already filed a complaint with German and European Union competition authorities over the insolvency 
process, which it describes as a "conspiracy" because it believes that Lufthansa will gain a bigger share of the 
German market.
"All this is down to prevent Ryanair growing in Germany, but it won't stop us," Michael O'Leary told Reuters in a 
telephone interview on Wednesday.
Germany has rejected Ryanair's claims.
A German economy ministry spokeswoman said a bridging loan of 150 million euros the government had granted 
Air Berlin did not breach anti-trust rules.
"I reject the accusation by Ryanair today that it was a staged insolvency application," the spokeswoman said.
A spokesman for Lufthansa declined to comment on the Ryanair accusations.
Ryanair CEO hits out at Air Berlin / Lufthansa deal
Germany faces allegations of maintaining a cosy relationship with its domestic industry and questions about 
whether authorities did enough to uncover an emissions scandal at carmaker Volkswagen, which is partially state-
owned.
Air Berlin said it had sounded out the German states of North-Rhine Westphalia and Berlin in June to see whether 
they would provide loan guarantees after Etihad signalled it was rethinking its strategy of holding minority 
investments in smaller carriers.
The German economy ministry spokeswoman said that negotiations between Lufthansa and Air Berlin had been 
going on for "months" as executives sought a long-term solution for the airline.
The German government said it expected no anti-trust issues because Air Berlin would be sold off in bits.
But O'Leary is not convinced his airline is being given a fair chance.
"A merger will take Lufthansa from 68% to 95% of the German domestic market and from 47% to 60% control of the 
total German market, which would be in breach of every known competition threshold rule and guideline in 
Germany and the EU," O'Leary said.
He said Alitalia's insolvency was being done on a fairer basis, with rival airlines being invited to submit offers.
"That's the process they should be going through with Air Berlin," he said.
When asked if Ryanair could bid for Air Berlin assets, he said he expected a deal would go through too quickly to 
give Ryanair a chance to bid and that only unattractive airport slots would be offered up.
"There's nothing to bid for, it's a ready-up," he said. "We will continue to grow, we're still buying more aircraft. But 
we will struggle to get slots, to base more aircraft in airports like Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich."
O'Leary said he hoped the EU authorities would step in to force competition remedies, such as giving up airport 
slots to rivals.
The EU Commission said it was in "constructive contact" with Germany. "We are confident that solutions can be 
found within the framework of EU law," a Commission spokesman said.
Izzet Sinan, partner at law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius said it was no surprise that Ryanair had voiced its 
objections.
"The question is what actions will follow the words," Sinan said. (Reuters)

t was supposed to be a success for Ukraine's pro-western leadership: a deal with Ryanair on flights to Kiev and the 
western city of Lviv.
It would have helped Ukrainians take advantage of the visa-free travel they have been granted by the EU - and 
would have shown that Ukraine, three years on from its pro-democracy revolution, is ready to attract much-needed 
investment.
But Ryanair last month cancelled its plans, accusing Kiev's main Boryspil airport of "failure to honour a growth 
agreement".
David O'Brien, the low-carrier's chief commercial officer, said the airport had "demonstrated that Ukraine is not yet a 
sufficiently mature or reliable business location to invest valuable Ryanair aircraft capacity".
The carrier accused Kiev of choosing to "protect highfare airlines (including Ukraine International Airlines)", the 
country's largest carrier.
Media and pro-reform MPs pointed the finger at UIA and its co-owner Igor Kolomoisky, one of Ukraine's oligarchs, 
for allegedly managing to torpedo the deal. Ukrainian social media exploded with angry comments. The failure 
matters more to Ukraine than to Ryanair. Kiev officials need to attract foreign investment to encourage growth as 
the country emerges from the slump that followed the 2014 revolution and Russia's annexation of Crimea.
Ryanair deal collapse grounds Kiev's hopes of a growth boost INSIDE BUSINESS EUROPE
Luring the low-cost carrier would have been a muchneeded boost.
Ryanair's plan to open four routes to Kiev and seven to Lviv would have involved only 1 per cent of its capacity. 
Even so, it would have taken the airline into a 45m-strong market where air travel is growing fast from a low base.
The country was deemed not 'mature or reliable' enough Both the EU visa-free agreement and economic recovery 
offer the prospect of continuing rapid growth towards west European levels.
for business Although accounts differ over why the talks failed, it is clear that Ukraine's corporate and state officials 
handled the situation badly.
Ryanair thought it had a deal with Kiev's privately owned second airport, Zhuliany, to which Hungarian budget 
airline Wizz Air already flies. When that fell through at the last moment, Ukraine's infrastructure minister, anxious to 
find a way of allowing Ryanair's plans to go ahead, signed a letter of intent involving state-owned Boryspil instead.
Kiev officials say that this committed Pavlo Ryabikin, Boryspil's director, to terms that he could never have agreed 
to, as they would have undermined the airport's commercial model.
Mr Ryabikin has revealed some details of the collapsed deal and called them untenable, including a five-year 
passenger fee for Ryanair of $7.50 per traveller that he said was below cost, well below what it charges other 
airlines, and would have left it with big losses.
Ukrainewas Other people familiar with the talks say that Mr Ryabikin was present when the letter of intent was 
signed, and raised no objections.
accused of choosing to protect high-fare flag carrier UIA Some airline executives suggest that Boryspil, as Ukraine's 
premier airport, is underperforming, partly because of its role as a hub for UIA, and it might be no bad thing for it to 
change its model.
UIA denied last month that it had lobbied to prevent the Ryanair deal, insisting that it would welcome the low-cost 
carrier's arrival to "provide an impetus to infrastructure development". But it later filed a lawsuit against the 
infrastructure ministry, claiming that the letter of intent with Ryanair violated the law, discriminated against UIA, and 
threatened development of air transport in Ukraine.
Boryspil is re-evaluating its model with the aim of reducing passenger fees to all airlines, in what could provide a 
route to reopening talks with Ryanair.
The government is making the right noises, insisting that it is committed to investigating why the Ryanair deal failed 
and to luring low-cost carriers. It has suggested upgrading Gostomel, a cargo airport near Kiev that is a base for 
Antonov, the aircraft manufacturer, with a terminal for low-cost airlines.
It is not too late for Ukraine to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and find a way of enticing Ryanair. If it can, the 
airline's jibe about Ukraine not yet being a reliable business destination could be quietly buried.
Ukraine's aspiring tourists, and all those who support its attempts to curb corrupt leadership and integrate more 
closely with western Europe, will be hoping that a solution can be found.

The collapse of Air Berlin has sparked a fierce battle over the rights to prime German take-off and landing slots, 
with Ryanair branding a state bailout of the airline a "conspiracy" to protect national carrier Lufthansa.
At stake is a valuable slice of the booming aviation market in Germany, Europe's third largest by passenger 
numbers. But this prize appears to have moved out of reach of some international rivals after Lufthansa, Germany's 
biggest carrier, emerged on Tuesday as leading talks to rescue its rival.
Air Berlin, which is Germany's second-biggest airline, was forced to file for insolvency after its largest shareholder 
Etihad, the UAE-based carrier, halted financial support. The airline has racked up losses of about (EURO)2bn over 
the past six years as it faced mounting competition from low-cost rivals such as Ryanair and easyJet.
The German government stepped in with a (EURO)150m loan to keep Air Berlin flying through the busy summer 
months while it negotiated the sale of parts of the business to Lufthansa and one other airline. But within hours, the 
move was decried as a "set up" by Ryanair.
Air Berlin collapse threatens to clip rivals' wings Lufthansa 's talks with German government to buy parts of 
carrier's business branded 'a conspiracy' by Ryana....
Europe's biggest low-cost airline has spent years aggressively building up its market share in Germany, attracted 
by its strong business travel and leisure demand. Ryanair competes for passengers with Eurowings, Lufthansa's 
lowcost airline based in Cologne.
"It is a complete and utter conspiracy," said Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, alleging that the deal was 
done to stop its expansion into Germany. "The German market is one of the biggest prizes in Europe. Instead of 
appointing a liquidator and selling it to all the airlines that would clearly want to invest in the German market, it is 
carved up so that Lufthansa can buy it."
He pointed to the auction process under way for Alitalia, the Italian carrier that entered administration in May, as the 
right way to sell Air Berlin. Alitalia, like Air Berlin, was backed by Etihad but also collapsed in the face of competition 
from cheaper rivals in the shortand medium-haul European market. A combined Lufthansa and Air Berlin would 
cement the German carrier's already dominant position in the country, taking Lufthansa's total capacity share to 
over 50 per cent, according to data from OAG based on summer 2017 schedules.
That would dwarf Ryanair's 6.4 per cent share of the market, and easyJet's 3 per cent. In the domestic German 
market, a combined Lufthansa-Air Berlin would have a share of over 90 per cent. Lufthansa also controls Austrian 
Airlines and Swiss International Air Lines. Aviation analysts have also seen the move as defensive by Lufthansa, 
designed to block more competitive airlines from expanding. Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Liberum, said that Air 
Berlin has long been a "shield" for Lufthansa, occupying territory and hindering the advance of low-cost airlines into 
the German market.
Air Berlin's collapse has meant Lufthansa now needs to move to secure this capacity, he said. Lufthansa has 
already declared an interest in working with Air Berlin. The approach started last year when it agreed a deal for Air 
Berlin to operate 40 of its aircraft for Lufthansa's subsidiary airlines.
"The news that Lufthansa is in talks to buy parts of Air Berlin feels like the culmination of a concentrated plan - first 
there was the wet lease deal, finalised in January this year, then the new CEO, Thomas Winkelmann was recruited 
from Lufthansa in February," said Daniel Roeska, an aviation analyst at Bernstein.
EasyJet is also involved in discussions to buy up parts of the carrier, according to two people with knowledge of the 
talks. This has angered Mr O'Leary, who said he has not been approached by Air Berlin or the German 
government.
Jonathan Wober, an aviation analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation, said easyJet was likely to be a more preferable 
deal partner. "EasyJet's not as lowcost as Ryanair, and its average fares are not as low as Ryanair. From that point 
of view it would be preferable to Lufthansa. But at the end of the day it's not Lufthansa that will decide."
Ryanair has already filed a complaint with German and EU competition authorities, but this is unlikely to get looked 
at until a deal takes place.
"If there were an outright acquisition of Air Berlin by Lufthansa, that would be a matter for the EU competition 
authorities because of the turnovers of the companies involved," a spokesperson for Germany's Federal Cartel 
Office said. However, economic circumstances, such as the fact Air Berlin has gone bust, are likely to be a 
consideration in cartel deliberations, according to one person close to the process.
The German government has already justified its intervention on the grounds of Air Berlin's "ongoing and positive 
long-term discussion" with Lufthansa and another airline "to continue operations under different ownership".
Germany's transport minister has also said he did not expect any deal to rescue Air Berlin involving Lufthansa to 
raise competition concerns.
A spokesperson for Lufthansa said it was in a "negotiating period and cannot make further comment".

carrier's business branded 'a conspiracy' by Ryana....
But consumer groups are likely to watch closely to make sure a combined entity does not result in higher fares for 
airline passengers. "Any concentration or increase in monopoly power in future due to the demise of Air Berlin could 
lead to higher prices," said Ingmar Streese, policy director at Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband, a German 
consumer association. See Markets

TOUR operator Thomas Cook and its German airline Condor are prepared to play an active role in a restructuring 
of insolvent carrier Air Berlin, Thomas Cook said yesterday.
"Thomas Cook and its subsidiary, the strengthened German holiday airline Condor, are standing ready to play an 
active role in the future of Air Berlin," a spokesman for Thomas Cook said in an emailed statement.
Air Berlin, Germany's secondlargest airline, filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday after key shareholder Etihad 
Airways withdrew funding following years of losses. Thomas Cook books some of its customers on flights with Air 
Berlin and its unit Niki, which means it is in the tour operator's interest that the German airline's operations continue.
Thomas Cook's comment echoed tour operator Tui, which has said it was involved in plans for Air Berlin's future 
and supported them.
Earlier this week, Air Berlin said that talks were ongoing with Lufthansa to buy parts of its business. However, Irish 
budget rival Ryanair on Tuesday filed a complaint with EU competition authorities in an attempt to block a Lufthansa 
takeover.
Ryanair said it lodged complaints with German officials and the European Commission, calling it an "obvious 
conspiracy" between the German airlines and their government.

BERLIN (AP) - Germany on Wednesday rejected a claim by budget airline Ryanair that a government loan for rival 
Air Berlin as part of its bankruptcy proceedings amounted to a "conspiracy" to keep the airline afloat until a new 
owner is found.
The Irish airline lodged a complaint with European Union competition authorities after Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy 
protection and then got a 150 million euro ($177 million) loan from the German government.
Ryanair said late Tuesday there's "an obvious conspiracy" between the German government, Lufthansa and Air 
Berlin. The loan will help Air Berlin to keep flights running for the next three months, while it is negotiating a possible 
deal with Lufthansa and another unnamed carrier, reported by German media to be easyJet.
A spokeswoman for Germany's Economy Ministry said it was "absurd" to claim that the rescue package had been 
staged. Beate Baron told reporters in Berlin that the government expects the loan to Germany's second-largest 
airline to be repaid.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also defended the government's loan for Air Berlin in an interview with four 
prominent German YouTube users.
Merkel said it would not have been appropriate to leave tens of thousands of travelers stranded at vacation resorts, 
"because the airline would not have been able to pay for the fuel" and the plane tickets would have no longer been 
usable.
Usually, when an airline files for bankruptcy in Germany, planes need to be grounded immediately and all further 
operations are stopped.
Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy protection Tuesday after its main shareholder, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, said it would 
make no more financing available following years of unsuccessful turnaround attempts.
The airline, which carries some 80,000 people a day mostly on short-haul destinations, made a loss of about 782 
million euros last year.

       BERLIN (dpa-AFX) - Subsequent to the bankruptcy filing of German no frills airline Air Berlin (AIBEF.PK), 
Lufthansa airline is strongly pursuing to acquire Air Berlin. Meanwhile, Ryanair, its Irish rival, accused conspiracy in 
the deal and said that the acquisition move will breach the existing competition rules in Germany in general and EU 
in particular.  Air Berlin had to choose the bankruptcy route as its businesses deteriorated in a fast pace. The 
airline's financial supporter and minority shareholder Etithad of Abu Dhabi has stopped its funding as Germany's 
second largest airline failed to record profits. Air Berlin has recorded loss of 782 million euros last year.   The 
German Federal Government has offered a bridge loan, secured by a federal guarantee, to maintain flight 
operations. The airline has been carrying around 80 thousand passengers on a daily basis. The funding to the tune 
of 150 million euros from the government will help continue the services.   The filing at the local district court of 
Berlin-Charlottenburg is a petition for the opening of debtor-in-possession insolvency proceedings. In addition, a 
similar petition has been filed with the local district court of Berlin-Charlottenburg.

Berlin (dpa) - Chancellor Angela Merkel ruled out taxpayers footing the bill for Air Berlin's rescue and said a 
government-backed 150-million-euro (175.5-million-dollar) bridge loan would head off the threat of the insolvent 
airline's collapse.
Berlin was forced to act because bills had to be paid and tickets honoured, Merkel said.
The risk to taxpayers was "relatively small," Merkel said in a YouTube interview on Wednesday.
"Otherwise," she said, "we would not have been permitted to provide this bridging loan."
A Ministry for Economic Affairs spokeswoman said it believed Air Berlin's talks with Lufthansa and other airlines, 
such as EasyJet, that are seeking to carve it up would be completed quickly.
However, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair said its believed there was a "conspiracy" between Berlin and Lufthansa 
over Air Berlin's future.
Ryanair's comments came after the airline filed complaints with both the German and European competition 
authorities over Air Berlin's insolvency, accusing Berlin of violating anti-monopoly laws by paving the way for 
Lufthansa to take over Air Berlin.
European Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said Wednesday that the commission and Germany were in 
"constructive contact" about the issue.
Merkel said the Federal Government had "very carefully considered" the decision to provide Air Berlin with the 
temporary loan to keep the carrier flying for three months.
Air Berlin's new chief representative Frank Kebekus told dpa he expected the airline's insolvency process to begin 
on November 1.

Affairs spokeswoman said it believed Air Berlin's talks with Lufthansa and other airlines, such as EasyJet, that are 
seeking to carve it up would be completed quickly.  However, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair said its believed there 
was a 'conspiracy' between Berlin and Lufthansa over Air Berlin's future.  Ryanair's comments came after the airline 
filed complaints with both the German and European competition authorities over Air Berlin's insolvency, accusing 
Berlin of violating anti-monopoly laws by paving the way for Lufthansa to take over Air Berlin.  European 
Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said Wednesday that the commission and Germany were in 'constructive 
contact' about the issue.  Merkel said the Federal Government had 'very carefully considered' the decision to 
provide Air Berlin with the temporary loan to keep the carrier flying for three months.  Air Berlin's new chief 
representative Frank Kebekus told dpa he expected the airline's insolvency process to begin on November 1.  Air 
Berlin is Germany's second-largest airline and employs 7,200 people in the country.   Copyright dpa

Next was a faller yesterday after Berenberg predicted a "Kodak moment" for the retailer.
"We believe Next is burdened by its overspaced store estate, which restricts its ability to invest in areas that matter 
most to the consumer - product and free home delivery, leading to market share erosion," the broker said. "While it 
was quick to recognise the online opportunity, it has failed to fully adapt its business model, instead focusing on 
short-term cash flow and profitability."
Kodak went bankrupt in 2012 after it held back from developing massmarket digital cameras to protect its lucrative 
film business. Similarly, Next had been protecting its stores rather than committing to ecommerce, said Berenberg. 
Offering free delivery "would bring short-term pain but longterm survival", it said.
It set a £36.50 price target on Next, which closed 2.8 per cent lower at £42.71.
Sterling was a tailwind for the wider market. The FTSE 100 closed up 0.4 per cent, rising 29.96 points to 7,383.85, 
thanks largely to dollar earners such as British American Tobacco, up 1.3 per cent to £49.08, and Diageo, ahead 
1.4 per cent to £25.36.
Airlines gained after Air Berlin said it had filed for insolvency. Ryanair hit a record high, up 3.4 per cent to 
(EURO)19.23, while British Airways owner IAG rose 2.9 per cent to 631p and Wizz Air took on 4.6 per cent to 
£29.32.
Next left ruffled after broker warns of ' Kodak moment' London
EasyJet, which is reportedly in the auction with Lufthansa to buy some of Berlin's assets, climbed 4.5 per cent to 
£13.22. Tui, which recently called off talks to merge its German airline Tui fly with Air Berlin's tourism operations, 
was up 2.2 per cent to £13.19.
BAE Systems rose 2.3 per cent to 594p after Goldman Sachs added the defence contractor to its "conviction list" 
with a 750p target. The stock has slipped to a deeper discount to US peers on concerns about a slowdown in 
growth. But those concerns looked misplaced given that Saudi Arabia would probably order a fleet of Typhoon 
aircraft before the year end, the broker said.
Shire took on 1.3 per cent to £38.43 on news that UK regulators had validated a marketing application for 
Lifitegrast. The drugmaker has targeted $1bn of US sales for the dry eye treatment by 2020 but has not guided on 
other markets.
Société Générale repeated "buy" advice with a £75 target. Even if Shire destroyed value with a planned 
neuroscience division spin-off, the share price was "so low as to imply that the remaining (highly valuable) rare 
disease business is unsustainable", the broker said. "This is just irrational."
Provident Financial lost 3.8 per cent to £18.82 as it drifted towards relegation at the next FTSE 100 review, which 
will hinge on closing prices on August 29.

Body
Air Berlin filed for insolvency yesterday, but will remain operating after the German government and Lufthansa 
stepped in to prevent the collapse of one of Europe's largest airlines.
The move was triggered after Etihad, the Abu Dhabi-based airline that is Air Berlin's biggest shareholder with a 29 
per cent stake, decided not to invest any more money after providing a series of cash injections over the past six 
years to keep the German carrier afloat.
It is the second failure of a large European airline in four months. Alitalia entered administration in May after its 
employees rejected a restructuring plan and Etihad, which owns 49 per cent of the struggling Italian carrier, said it 
would provide no more funding.
Air Berlin has been under pressure after racking up losses of about (EURO)2bn over the past six years, and has net 
debt of (EURO)1.2bn. The situation has worsened as Etihad has begun unravelling its own strategy of buying up 
minority stakes in airlines to drive traffic to its hub in the Gulf, after facing losses of $1.9bn in 2016.
News of the insolvency filing drove the German carrier's shares down more than 30 per cent in afternoon trading.
Insolvent Air Berlin to keep flying ? Etihad draws line on cash injections ? Germany and Lufthansa step in to 
avoid collapse
The German government was informed of Etihad's decision on Friday, and is to provide (EURO)150m in temporary 
credit lines backed by state guarantees. It said this would keep the airline flying and avoid leaving "many tens of 
thousands of travellers" stranded.
Andrew Charlton, an aviation analyst, said the insolvency was "inevitable". "Air Berlin tried five or six different paths. 
It's always been a difficult business for them to try to make work."
Lufthansa said it was in talks with the carrier over buying some of its assets. It already has a close relationship with 
Air Berlin following an agreement last year for the latter to operate 40 aircraft for the German flag carrier's 
subsidiaries.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, said the deal was "clearly being set up for Lufthansa to take over Air 
Berlin, which will be in breach of all known German and EU competition rules."
It said it had lodged complaints with the European Commission and the German competition regulator.
But the German government justified its intervention because of Air Berlin's "ongoing and positive long-term 
discussion" with Lufthansa and an unnamed airline "to continue operations under different ownership". EU state aid 
rules restrict government intervention.
EasyJet is understood to be the unnamed carrier, according to two people close to the talks. It declined to 
comment. Alexander Dobrindt, Germany's transport minister, said he did not expect any rescue deal involving 
Lufthansa to raise competition concerns. The European Commission said last night it was in "constructive contact" 
with Germany over the issue.

Irish budget carrier Ryanair is protesting a proposed Lufthansa acquisition of Air Berlin assets, following Air Berlin's 
filing for administration.
Ryanair is accusing the German government of a "conspiracy" to "carve up" Air Berlin and is submitting complaints 
to German competition regulator Bundeskartellamt as well as the European Commission.
The German government has agreed to guarantee a 150 million ($176 million) bridge loan to Air Berlin from bank 
KfW, after shareholder Etihad Airways ceased to continue funding the struggling airline.
Lufthansa and another, unnamed, airline are negotiating the acquisition of Air Berlin assets, says the government, 
and a decision is likely to be finalised over the next few weeks.
But Ryanair claims Air Berlin's insolvency is being "manufactured" in order to enable Lufthansa to take over the 
airline without taking on debts.
"Bearing in mind the scale of the market shares and the European implications involved, it is all the more important 
that the European Commission takes immediate and decisive action," it adds.

RYANAIR has officially objected to plans for Lufthansa to rescue rival budget carrier Air Berlin after it yesterday filed 
for insolvency.
Air Berlin's main shareholder, Etihad Airways, refused to provide further financial support, with the airline saying 
that talks were ongoing with Lufthansa to buy parts of its business.
However, Irish budget rival Ryanair last night filed a complaint with EU competition authorities in an attempt to block 
the Lufthansa takeover. It lodged complaints with German officials and the European Commission, calling it an 
"obvious conspiracy" between the German airlines and their government.
Germany's largest airline Lufthansa said it was "already in negotiations" to take over parts of the Air Berlin group. In 
January German cartel authorities allowed Lufthansa to lease Air Berlin planes, helping it to develop its Eurowings 
budget subsidiary, a Ryanair rival.
Air Berlin said the German government will provide a bridging loan to allow all scheduled flights to operate as 
planned.

UK air navigation service provider NATS has been cleared of breaching its licence conditions, following a formal 
investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority, marking the first time the agency has used investigatory powers granted 
in 2000.
The investigation arose from a complaint by Ryanair and London Stansted airport’s operator, which had alleged that 
NATS’ En Route division had failed to provide adequate resources to manage traffic performance within London 
airspace, and had discriminated against traffic landing at Stansted.
But the CAA says “no compliance breach” has been found, although it notes the decision was “finely balanced”.
The CAA had been given the powers to investigate under transport legislation in 2000, and this first use “highlights 
the potential seriousness of the complaint”, director of consumers and markets Richard Moriarty says.
Stansted airport’s operator had complained in April 2016 about “substantial” flow-restriction delays, and alleged that 
NATS En Route had failed to make proper contingency plans for long-term controller absences. It also alleged that 
London Heathrow flights had been given higher priority over those to other London airports. Ryanair subsequently 
echoed this complaint the following August.
While there was evidence of increased delays in 2016 compared with previous years, NATS En Route had “not 
failed to take all reasonable steps” to meet demand for approach control services for Stansted, the CAA says.
There was “no evidence” of discrimination, it says. Structural features of the Heathrow service – such as a larger 
number of rostered controllers – enabled it to be “more resilient”.
The “finely balanced” decision said there had been increased delays

 The private investment firm which owns British low-cost carrier Monarch Airlines is considering a bid for Italy's 
Alitalia, according to Sky News. 
Sky reported Monday evening that Greybull Capital is keen on Alitalia's engineering business, and would consider 
seeking partners to help operate the airline's short-haul business. Greybull also owns British Steel, acquired from 
Tata Steel Europe in 2016.  
However, Greybull is reportedly less enthusiastic over taking on Alitalia's ground handling operations, which may 
put it at a disadvantage in the auction process, after the Italian government put the airline up for sale earlier this 
year. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC is also involved in the Alitalia bidding process, with easyJet PLC also having expressed 
interest.

INVESTMENT firm Greybull Capital is mulling a bid for Italian airline Alitalia, in a move which would add another 
struggling airline to a portfolio which already includes British budget carrier Monarch, according to reports.
The airline went into administration in May, with rivals circling Italy's flag-carrier after the Italian government was 
forced to inject (EURO)600m (£545m) to keep it flying.
A Greybull bid would only cover the engineering parts of the airline, Sky News reported, with a partner needed to 
continue Alitalia's shorthaul operations. The Italian government has previously indicated it will favour bids for the 
entire airline rather than allowing it to be broken up. Ryanair and Easyjet have already made bids.
Distressed business investor Greybull is a family investment office. It is best known for its purchase last year of 
British Steel, a renamed Scunthorpe steelworks. It also owns a controlling stake in Monarch Group. Greybull could 
not be contacted for comment.

For many in Britain, holidays used to involve a couple of weeks with the family abroad and the occasional booze 
cruise. However, new data from the Office for National Statistics reveal big changes to how Britons enjoy their 
holidays, with each UK resident making almost 50 per cent more foreign trips last year than in 1996 due to the 
popularity of shorter vacations and city mini-breaks.
The analysis shows that low-cost airlines have revolutionised the way Britons holiday, with budget flights on the 
likes of Ryanair and EasyJet making it possible for people to take several shorter trips overseas each year rather 
than just one.
"One of the most likely explanations for UK residents going on shorter holidays is the growth of the budget airlines," 
the ONS said. GT

Ryanair has confirmed the seat manufacturer Zodiac for its new Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft. The aircraft, the first 
five of which are being delivered from Spring 2019, have an extra eight seats on board taking capacity from the 
current 189 seats to 197.
Ryanair refers to the Boeing 737 Max 200 as a ,ÄúGamechanger,Äù aircraft, in part because as well as offering 
four percent more seats per flight the aircraft will reduce fuel consumption by up to 16 percent and reduce noise 
emissions by 40 percent.
The airline announced in June 2017 that the purchase of 10 more of the Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft to add to the 
existing firm order for 100 Max 200s (and 100 options). The airline,Äôs aim is to grow its traffic to 200 million 
customers per year by 2024. Ryanair operates an all-Boeing fleet with an average age of six and a half years ,Äì 
the youngest in Europe. It took delivery of its 450th Boeing aircraft in March 2017.
For passengers, the main differences will be more space - more legroom and overhead lockers - due to Boeing,Äôs 
redesign of the aircraft to remove the rear galley and relocate the two rear toilets into that space.

British Airways and Easyjet have sent text alerts to customers warning of delays at EU border controls.¬ BA said it 
is asking travelers to arrive early as it is expecting longer queues due to "enhanced immigration checks" across 
Europe.
The airline has already sent text messages to customers flying back from Lyon, Madrid, Barcelona and Milan.¬ 
Ryanair is also advising customers to arrive at least three hours before the scheduled departure time.
The warning comes as airports prepare for one of the busiest weekends of the summer.¬ Sean Tipton from the 
Association of British Travel Agents said already a record 2.4 million people set off in one weekend at the beginning 
of the school holidays. <br class="" /><br class="" />He said: "In most cases people are getting through passport 
control fairly swiftly but I think there might be an issue with certain airports where they haven't actually considered 
just dealing with the fact that: record numbers, August, plus these new requirements - they may be understaffed."¬ 
The aviation minister has promised to urge his EU counterparts to "do all they can. ,Äù
The European Commission said the delays were "the price of security".¬ Rule changes brought in after recent terror 
attacks in Paris and Brussels mean people entering and leaving the Schengen area, which allows passport-free 
movement across much of the EU, face more security checks. <br class="" /><br class="" />Under the new 
measures, details of passengers from non-Schengen countries, such as the UK, are run through databases to alert 
authorities if they are known to pose a threat.¬
The member states have until October 7 to put the new rules in place.

Alitalia has opened a new phase in its sale process, setting a deadline of 15 September for expressions of interest 
in making a binding bid.
A source with knowledge of the matter says that within 10 days of this deadline expiring, Alitalia's special 
commissioners will consider the offers and notify parties that have met the "requirements". Those shortlisted will 
then have until 2 October to submit a binding offer.
This will be followed by phase in which they have an opportunity to "improve" their offers before making final bids 
on 5 November.
Italian media reports suggest that up to 13 parties made nonbinding proposals for Alitalia in July. Ryanair has 
confirmed that it did so.

Highlight: For Nicola Byrne, founder of 11890 directory enquiries, any business setback is nothing more than a 
reason to clamber back up on the horse again 
Body
CV: Nicola Byrne
Role: chief executive and founder of 11890 and Cloud90
Age: 46
Family: three children, and partnered with Conor
Hobbies: singing
Favourite film: Independence Day, directed by Roland Emmerich
‘You don’t realise how much you’ve done until you’ve done it,” says Nicola Byrne, in a tone of complete conviction.
The chief executive and founder of 11890 directory enquiries and Cloud90, a social media analytics company, is 
sitting in a dimly-lit basement on Merrion Square, the headquarters of the Irish Exporters Association (IEA), where 
she has recently been installed as president. She says that upstairs is a lot nicer, but she is not fussed.
The following hour feels like a motivational talk, a story of reaching dead ends, changing directions and starting 
again. For Byrne, getting back on one’s horse is an art form – a mere shrug of the shoulders. Sure, she’s hit the 
rocks with her companies, but so what?
“I was recently talking to this lovely girl whose business had gone kaput. I was laughing at her, going: ‘What are you 
sitting there feeling sorry for yourself for? You’re not going from one failure to the other, you’re just getting better at 
it’,” says Byrne.
What you’re in today might not be what you’re doing in five years
“If my business fails, it’s not that I’m not good at running a business, it’s that the market turns and that’s what 
happens. The world keeps moving and what you’re in today might not be what you’re doing in five years.
“We’re not all lucky enough to work solidly in a business that doesn’t change. There are very few industries that are 
untouched. There are some that have thrived. Sometimes you’re just at the wrong side of the curve.”
Her first company, Stenic Media, sold advertisements for the back of travel ticket wallets. At its height, it put top 
brands like Jaguar and Rolex on tickets for Aer Lingus, Ryanair, Irish Ferries and Stena Line. Then, in the wake of 
9/11, travel volume plummeted, airline industry losses soared and advertising was slashed.
So Byrne moved on to 11890, which was a success – until the internet came along. Another readjustment was 
necessary and, in 2014, the business launched a social media tracking service called Cloud90.
“I think the important thing I’ve learned along the way is that failing isn’t a bad thing. Most of these guys who made 
billions are frauds. They get lucky building a technology company and they’re going around claiming all the credit 
for it. It was luck and circumstance. They didn’t have any more talent than anybody else,” says Byrne.
“The guy who comes in to talk down to you is the guy who’s got absolutely nothing behind it. He’s got no skills and 
he couldn’t repeat it to save his life. He couldn’t pass on any tips to you because he got lucky, so he can’t explain 
it.”
If it all turns sour, Byrne says that she has a full taxi licence to fall back on.
“I did it as a backup for my dad. Now I just go in and renew it every year. If all else fails, I’m going back to taxi 
driving,” she says.
Byrne was born in Cabra and raised in Portmarnock, and her father is one of her biggest influences. He claims to 
have had 17 different jobs, starting off as a pattern cutter.
“He’s been a shop owner, a taxi man and a salesman in Johnston Mooney & O’Brien. He always did what it took to 
survive,” says Byrne.
“There was no ego, there were no preconceptions, he just did what it took. He would go out at 7am and I wouldn’t 
see him till 9pm. He worked really hard, and we always had enough to get by.”
Her mother was a furrier, preparing and dealing in furs, which allowed Byrne and her brother and sister to frequently 
don mock fur hats and coats.
Byrne attended St Marnock’s National School and Portmarnock Community School. As she describes it, her 
schooling years were the equivalent of “trying to fit a square peg in a really round hole”.
“Everyone learns differently, and I learned quickly. But I learned from listening, not that anyone would believe that 
with the amount I talk. Not everyone keeps up with the same speed. I would find it awfully frustrating. I would think: 
‘The answer is this, obviously.’ You just realise you’re different. You don’t fit,” says Byrne.
Byrne failed her Leaving Certificate on her first attempt. But she repeated, and went on to study for a Fás course in 
freight forwarding and customs clearance.
Her first job was as an export clerk at Gateaux, one of Ireland’s largest cake manufacturers owned by Lyons 
Holdings. Her next jobs were at Jacob’s Biscuits, Evian, 98FM, AC Nielsen and Bank of Ireland. While she was 
working for the last of those companies, the idea for Stenics Media struck her.
“I had been doing a lot of travelling, and every time I flew with an international airline, I got a ticket wallet with an ad 
on it. Aer Lingus, I realised, didn’t have any ads. My dad was doing some work for the chairman of Aer Lingus, and I 
said: ‘Can you ask him if I can have a meeting?’” says Byrne.
What you’re in today might not be what you’re doing in five years
At the tender age of 27, she convinced David Brunworth, the then commercial director for Aer Lingus, to give her a 
contract to sell advertising for the airline. This led her to securing contracts with Ryanair, Irish Ferries and Stena 
Line.
“A huge amount of people came on board and said: ‘If you can have theirs, you can have all of ours.’ I got them all,” 
says Byrne.
Stenics Media then won the business for the Eircom telephone book, as well as An Post. At the weekends, up to 70 
people would have been posting stickers on telephone boxes all across the country with the ads that her company 
sold.
The company still exists, but is considerably smaller than it was at its height.
In 2006, Byrne founded 11890. The idea for the company came to her when she was on holiday with her family in 
Blackpool. Her brother was working in telecoms at the time, and started talking about how the market was 
deregulating and how profitable it was. Byrne jumped in.
It started with business-to-business and signed up the likes of KPMG, An Post and AIB. It eventually grew to two 
call centres, one in Dublin and one in Galway.
Six years later, however, the internet had caught up and directory enquiries were something to scroll through, not to 
phone for.
But Byrne had another idea: if the internet was stealing her lunch, why shouldn’t she dine out on the internet?
If all else fails, I’m going back to taxi driving . . . I did it as a backup for my dad
Three years ago, 11890 launched Cloud90, a service that tracks social media messages and relays them to a 
dashboard at the customer’s offices.
Crisis management is a key market for the service, whose aim is to put businesses in a better position to respond 
quickly.
“We read the internet live and collect the risks. We read every single post issued by the bank, about the bank, and 
from the bank. We read every single one, and criteria it for a risk and content and sentiment,” says Byrne.
“We have an automated service and we just stream it in. People in marketing departments are supposedly reading 
this stream of data, but the bigger guys who are using it for the last four years have recognised the risks are too 
great.
“In a large organisation, everyone has the power to see the data simultaneously, but nobody is analysing it in one 
place; everyone is working off emotional data and instinct. What I discovered is that it’s flawed, enormously.”
This time, it was Ulster Bank which took a leap of faith with Byrne. Once built, the software notified the bank about a 
bank raid on one occasion. “A guy on the street took a picture with the cops and robbers everywhere and the 
caption was: ‘It looks like we have a bank raid.’ I got the alert in a minute and a half. Head office then knew that this 
was going on. It was their first notice of it happening,” says Byrne.
She finds the whole world of social media to be fascinating. How people act, speak with and document their lives on 
this new tool is almost mesmerising when the data is perused.
“You have the regular agitators that complain about everything,” Byrne says. “They’re like children and they have no 
filter between them and the keyboard. As a child, you learn to articulate yourself, and then as an adult, you regulate 
that, realising that you can’t just say anything that comes into your head. The internet and the power of the 
individual phone have removed those rules again, and people think it’s okay to go out and say whatever they think – 
What you’re in today might not be what you’re doing in five years
and it’s not. They’re fools who have an opinion, and they think their opinion matters more than everyone else,” says 
Byrne.
“We’ve lost the ability to discern fact and fiction. They have become so blurred you can’t tell any more. The kids 
today are going to have a real problem working out which is which. If they were left to their own devices, they would 
think the world is ending and we’re all going to hell in a handcart. We’re just not.”
Byrne’s hypothesis is that social media is just a set of new languages that humans have yet to grasp. “You can 
think of the internet as sets of rules being born, with millions of new languages. There are Twitter rules, Google 
rules, Facebook rules,” she says.
Cloud90 has been a success. Today, the company employs 53 and has also developed another online reputation 
management tool called RiskEye. It is even in talks with BT in Britain to kickstart its scaling across the Irish sea.
Byrne’s latest challenge is her 18-month presidency of the Irish Exporters Association, for which Ireland’s existential 
threat du jour is Brexit.
“The one thing that Europe gave us is solid secure political platform to trade,” says Byrne.
“Trade keeps everyone out of poverty. Choosing not to want to trade with somebody is the most bizarre thing I’ve 
ever seen. The history of the world is where trade is open, everybody wins. Where trade isn’t open, everybody dies. 
I just can’t understand why you would have such a policy not to want to trade with your nearest partner.”
More than ever, she says, Ireland needs to grow its exports. It is the only way the country will survive.
“The government needs to be more aware that our food exports are important, but when these food exports get big 
enough they open planta in other countries. It stops being an export, it’s then a local product. So Kerrygold has 
plants in the US and it’s a global company and registered in Ireland, and it still pays all its taxes here in Ireland, so 
that’s fantastic. We just need ten of them,” says Byrne.
Challenges at work are not enough, however. One of Byrne’s defining characteristics is that she is a restless soul, 
taking up challenges outside office hours too.
“I’ve taken up piano lessons,” she says enthusiastically. “I went on my own to the classes on the first night, and she 
asked us to sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in tune, and I thought: ‘Good luck with that.’ We spent about an hour 
and a half on it, and I came back home and could just about repeat it to the neighbour, Cathy.
“She asked could she come too, so for two and a half years we’ve been going. We can sing eight songs now in 
tune. We’re not natural talents, but at least we’re giving it a go.”

Italian-appointed commissioners set out the key conditions this week for tabling bids in the public tender for the 
country's collapsed airline Alitalia.
The Italian government is hoping to avoid the break-up of the flag carrier by insisting that it will give preference to 
bids for the entire company.
The conditions are designed to prevent would-be buyers trying to carve off lucrative routes or valuable assets, such 
as key buildings owned by Alitalia, from participating. Over the past two months, the commissioners have sounded 
out the market and received non-binding offers from at least 10 carriers, including Ryanair, Etihad and easyJet.
The airline collapsed in May, bringing three years of investment by Etihad, the UAE carrier, to a bitter end.
The group, which has been run by three commissioners since it collapsed, is demanding bids for the whole 
company, or failing that, separate bids for its aviation business, including maintenance, and its ground handling 
business.
The deadline for the public tender for binding offers is October 2. The process is being managed by bankers at 
Rothschild.
In an email to the Financial Times, Luigi Gubitosi, one of three state-appointed commissioners running Alitalia, 
expressed confidence that a buyer would be found.

Groups such as Ryanair and easyJet have shown interest since Alitalia opened up its data room. But there are 
some doubts that anyone will want to take ownership of the airline given its legacy of lossmaking, high-cost 
structure, and struggles with unions and its employees.

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary yesterday warned of a "real and distinct" threat that flights from the UK to the EU 
could be grounded from April 2019, meaning there will be "no holidays" that summer.
O'Leary yesterday gave transport secretary Chris Grayling a briefing note saying the aviation industry had a hard 
deadline of September 2018 for an open skies agreement to be reached.
"Otherwise we will have to start cancelling flights, or taking them off sale," he told reporters.
This would be "deeply damaging for UK tourism, traffic and tens of thousands of jobs at UK airports, within British 
tourism and the UK economy for as long as such catastrophic disruption would persist," the document said.
But it was "highly unlikely" that the UK would be able to negotiate an agreement in time, given "a distinct and 
noticeable lobbying effort by French and German airlines", such as Lufthansa and Air France. They were calling for 
the EU27 to agree terms "so onerous" the UK would be unable to accept them without rowing back on certain "red 
lines", like ECJ jurisdiction, O'Leary said.

UK Government Urged To Pressure EU Over "Shameful" Airport Queues

 The UK government has been urged to use "whatever influence it can" to pressure European Union states to 
adequately staff their airports after British holidaymakers faced chaos at passport controls.
Tourists arriving in some popular destinations have been met with "shameful" immigration lines hundreds of metres 
long - some having to wait for up to four hours - as staff carry out tighter counter-terror checks, according to one 
lobby group.
Experts have warned that travellers heading to some popular European destinations this summer may face 
increasing disruption as the new measures are rolled out.
Airlines UK, an industry body representing UK-registered carriers, said it had warned the Department for Transport 
about the problem in May, although they were told by ministers the issue had eased.
Tim Alderslade, the body's chief executive, said: "Clearly the situation has changed markedly as we enter peak 
holiday season, and it is now up to the UK government to work with industry to use whatever influence it can within 
the EU to persuade Schengen Member States to resource their border operations properly."
New European Union rules introduced following terror attacks in Paris and Brussels require countries to carry out 
more stringent checks on travellers entering and leaving the Schengen area, which allows passport-free movement 
across much of the EU.
The change means the details of passengers from non-Schengen countries, such as the UK, are run through 
databases to alert authorities if they are known to pose a threat.
However Alderslade said attempts to improve resources at border controls had "failed to happen thus far".
He added: "It is passengers and consumers - many of whom are from the UK - who are suffering as a 
consequence."
Pictures on social media in recent days have shown long lines of passengers in crowded terminals.
UK Government Urged To Pressure EU Over "Shameful" Airport Queues
Lobby group Airlines For Europe (A4E) said passengers arriving at airports in Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and 
Belgium are being forced to endure long waits to get through immigration.
The group, which represents carriers including easyJet PLC, Ryanair Holdings PLC and British Airways' parent 
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, claimed some passengers are missing their flights because of the 
issue.
A4E managing director Thomas Reynaert said passengers had been left "devastated".
He said: "Travellers face long lines and can't get on their flights. Queuing for up to four hours has been the top 
record these days.
"Airports like Madrid, Palma de Mallorca, Lisbon, Lyon, Paris-Orly, Milan or Brussels are producing shameful 
pictures of devastated passengers in front of immigration booths, in lines stretching hundreds of metres.
"At some airports, flight delays have increased by 300% compared to last year."
A4E warned the situation could worsen in the coming weeks as the new regulations have not yet been fully 
implemented. The six-month period to put the enhanced checks in place ends on October 7.
A spokeswoman for travel trade organisation Abta said: "New, stricter passport checks are resulting in longer 
queues at some airports, including Palma, which is already busy due to a significant increase in passenger 
numbers.
"Tour operators will ensure that customers get to the airport in plenty of time so that they are not in danger of 
missing their flights.
"However, independent travellers will need to check the situation with their airlines and, where necessary, ensure 
they factor these longer queuing times into their travel plans when flying in and out of the airport.
"It is also extremely important that border control check points are sufficiently resourced so that queuing times are 
kept to a minimum."
Travellers at Barcelona's El Prat airport have faced further disruption in the past week amid unofficial strike action 
by security staff.
Aceta, the association of Spanish air transport companies, said some airlines had to delay flights because many of 
their passengers could not board on time.
The firm said since July 24 around 1,000 passengers had not made their flights.
One Briton tweeted on Tuesday: "22 people were not allowed on flight home from Barcelona airport yesterday 
afternoon. Plane left most empty. Security queue."

The Italian government is hoping to avoid the break-up of Alitalia by insisting it will give preference to bids for the 
entire company at the launch of the final stage of its sale out of bankruptcy.
The state-appointed commissioners running the airline yesterday set out the key conditions for tabling bids in the

includes maintenance, and for its airport ground handling activities. Such conditions are designed to prevent would-
be buyers trying to carve off lucrative routes or valuable assets, such as key buildings owned by Alitalia, from 
participating. The conditions state that if two offers are equal, preference will be given to the one for the whole 
airline.
Alitalia has been run by three commissioners since it collapsed in May, bringing three years of investment by

During the past two months, the commissioners have sounded out the market, and have received non-binding 
offers from at least 10 carriers, including Ryanair, Etihad and easyJet. Based on the interest so far, there is growing 
confidence inside Alitalia of a successful sale. The fate of the carrier, which has been beset with problems for 
decades, is being watched closely across the airline industry, particularly in Europe and the Middle East.

The Italian government agreed to pump (EURO)600m in taxpayer funds into Alitalia to keep it afloat for six months, 
with the goal of selling the whole airline by the end of the year.
Luigi Gubitosi, one of the commissioners, said in an emailed statement yesterday: "We think Alitalia has great 
untapped potential - and from the market interest, we aren't the only ones." He added: "This potential is even 
greater if the company remains whole."
Alitalia's financial troubles were caused from a combination of competition from low-cost carriers and its own high 
cost base. One of the big questions hanging over the sale is whether buyers - particularly for the whole carrier - will 
be willing to take on this legacy.
Andrew Lobbenberg, an aviation analyst at HSBC, said: "People coming in with fresh capital would want to see 
meaningful change. There's no evidence of acceptance of that reality."
But Mr Gubitosi, who has broad powers to transform the airline, said its financial position was already improving 
and revenues growing.
The sale, managed by bankers at Rothschild, will be open to bidders of all nationalities and consortiums. Private 
equity firms are also expected to participate. Binding offers are due in October, followed by a period of negotiation 
until November. Alitalia faces liquidation if it does not find a buyer for the whole company or its main components. 
Chris Tarry, an aviation consultant, said: "I'm afraid there's a great disappointment ahead. The brand is important in 
Italy and you can see how that brand can continue but you need a completely different approach to the operating 
model."

Andrew Lobbenberg, an aviation analyst at HSBC, said: "People coming in with fresh capital would want to see 
meaningful change. There's no evidence of acceptance of that reality."
But Mr Gubitosi, who has broad powers to transform the airline, said its financial position was already improving 
and revenues growing.
The sale, managed by bankers at Rothschild, will be open to bidders of all nationalities and consortiums. Private 
equity firms are also expected to participate. Binding offers are due in October, followed by a period of negotiation 
until November. Alitalia faces liquidation if it does not find a buyer for the whole company or its main components. 
Chris Tarry, an aviation consultant, said: "I'm afraid there's a great disappointment ahead. The brand is important in 
Italy and you can see how that brand can continue but you need a completely different approach to the operating 
model."

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary jets in for key talks with transport secretary Chris Grayling today as concerns 
mount over airlines' flight rights post Brexit.
From March 2019, the UK no longer automatically has the same flight permissions as an EU member, meaning the 
right of its carriers to fly to the EU and beyond will have to be renegotiated.
The aviation industry has warned repeatedly that flights from the UK could be disrupted and even grounded if a new 
legal framework is not agreed by then. The situation has become increasingly urgent because the industry and its 
regulators have to finalise flight timetables many months in advance.
"We are committed to getting the right deal for Britain," a government spokesperson said.

South Korean low-cost carrier Jeju Air is due to add another Boeing 737-800 (MSN 36814) as part of plans to grow 
its fleet to 32 aircraft by year end.
The 2009-built aircraft is currently on lease to Norwegian by FPG Amentum, according to Airfinance Journal’s Fleet 
Tracker.
Jeju Air operates 29 leased aircraft and indicates in its second-quarter earnings release that it plans to add three 
more units by the end of 2017.
It will then add six more aircraft each year until 2020.
Jeju Air’s second-quarter net profit jumped to 15.1 billion won ($14 million) from 4.6 billion won a year earlier. 
Revenue improved 41%, to 228 billion won, over the same period.
"In the second and fourth quarters when demand is relatively lower than the other two quarters, we focused on 
attracting customers with lower ticket prices. Route diversification also helped, offsetting lower demand on Chinese 
routes amid a diplomatic row with Beijing," the airline says.
Operating profit also soared to 16.2 billion won from 600 million won during the year-earlier period, marking the 
carrier’s 12th consecutive operating profit.
In April Jeju Air took delivery of the final 737-800 from a lease agreement with SMBC Aviation Capital.
The aircraft, MSN 37543, is a 2009-vintage aircraft that was previously operated by Ryanair, according to Airfinance 
Journal's Fleet Tracker.
Dublin-based SMBC Aviation Capital announced a four-aircraft agreement last November.
The first aircraft, MSN 35018, delivered in December. MSNs 37540 and 37541 were delivered in February and 
March

Air Berlin is at risk of defaulting on more than &euro;600 million equivalent of bonds, including &euro;130 million of 
convertible bonds, after the carrier filed for insolvency, GlobalCapital reports.
The sister publication of Airfinance Journal saysit is unclear what will happen to Air Berlin’s bonds, which include a 
Sfr100m 2019, a &euro;170 million 2019, and a &euro;225 million 2018.
The fate of other debt issues also hangs in the balance, with structured notes issued by Etihad vehicles EA 
Partners I and II, which are backed by stakes in its airline partners, slumping in Tuesday’s (15 August) trading.
These bonds have already been hit by a standstill on another Etihad partner, Alitalia, earlier this year.
Etihad’s decision to pull the plug came after it helped Air Berlin in February to refinance its &euro;140 million 6% 
convertible bonds that were puttable in March, through an exchange offer that was shunned by the bond holders.
HSBC led the exchange offer, designed to delay the put by eight months, giving Air Berlin time to implement its 
restructuring efforts without risking default.
At the time, Air Berlin received agreements from its bondholders to exchange just &euro;41.3 million of the existing 
bonds into a new &euro;125 million 2019 convertible paying 8.5%. Etihad accounted for &euro;40 million of that 
commitment.
Simultaneously, Air Berlin sold new convertible notes hoping to raise &euro;85 million and managed to find enough 
demand for &euro;83.7 million, which came from Etihad and other institutional investors.
HSBC itself participated by buying &euro;53.7 million of the new bonds and entered into a total return swap for the 
same amount with Etihad.
Shares in Air Berlin have lost more than half their value since Monday, giving the company a market capitalisation 
of &euro;43 million.
Airfinance Journal has been reporting in detail on Air Berlin’s insolvency. Read more here:

Lufthansa wants to take about 90 of insolvent Air Berlin’s 140 aircraft and absorb them into its Eurowings brand, 
German media has reported.
The Sueddeutsche Zeitung says that, according to sources within Lufthansa, the German flag carrier is eyeing most 
of Air Berlin’s widebody aircraft, about 40 short- and medium-range aircraft and the 38 aircraft that Lufthansa is 
already leasing from Air Berlin.
Air Berlin’s fleet includes 41 Airbus A320-family aircraft, nine Boeing 737-family aircraft, 18 A330s and four 
turboprops, according to Airfinance Journal’s Fleet Tracker.
That count excludes the 20 narrowbodies operated by Air Berlin subsidiary Niki and the 38 aircraft on lease to 
Lufthansa.
Today Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary told Reuters that his company was interested in bidding for the whole of Air 
Berlin, although he questioned what would be left “by the time Lufthansa completes the discussions".
It was widely reported that only Lufthansa was present at a first round of formal talks on the Air Berlin sale on 
Friday.
However, Easyjet is also thought to be in the running for some of Air Berlin’s operations.
Yesterday, the Rheinische Post claimed the British budget carrier was making a play for more than half of Air 
Berlin’s slots at Duesseldorf Airport.
These were mainly for domestic German routes and certain others to European destinations where Air Berlin was in 
direct competition with Eurowings and which might spark antitrust concerns were Lufthansa to acquire them.

Ryanair has protested to German and European competition authorities about what it describes as an “obvious 
conspiracy” to allow Lufthansa to take over bankrupt Air Berlin.
“This manufactured insolvency is clearly being set up to allow Lufthansa to take over a debt-free Air Berlin which 
will be in breach of all known German and EU competition rules,” says Ryanair in a statement.
The Dublin-based low-cost carrier also accuses the German government of aiding the creation of a Lufthansa 
“monopoly” by extending &euro;150 million of temporary state aid to Air Berlin, which filed for bankruptcy yesterday 
after main shareholder Etihad pulled support.
Furthermore, Ryanair says that the German government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin are manoeuvring to “carve up” 
the latter’s assets “while excluding major competitors and ignoring both EU competition and State Aid rules”.
The Irish carrier also appealed directly to the European Commission to intercede, as it alleges that the German 
antitrust authority, the Bundeskartellamt, “is likely to struggle to get out of bed” to tackle the issue.
Ryanair has traditionally struggled to gain as much market share in Germany as it has in other large European 
nations.

Ryanair is interested in bidding for the whole of Air Berlin, but needs access to more data on the airline’s finances, 
Ryanair’s chief executive has told Reuters.
"We would be very happy to bid for the whole of Air Berlin, which is generally a short-haul, domestic, intra-EU 
carrier," O'Leary told the newswire by telephone.
"But we don't know how much restructuring it will take, how much money is it losing, why is it losing so much money 
in a market where we make money," he added.
O'Leary told Reuters that Ryanair needed information on Air Berlin's leases, employment contracts and terms with 
airports before it could determine how much restructuring would be required.
O'Leary has also complained that the Air Berlin insolvency process is a "stitch-up" to help strengthen Lufthansa, 
which he worries will swoop for the rump of Air Berlin before other buyers are given an opportunity.
Ryanair, which bought budget carrier Buzz from KLM in 2003, is keen to play a role in future changes to the 
European airline industry.
For instance, the Irish carrier has signalled interest in insolvent Alitalia, if the Italian airline can be restructured.
"We are clearly going to play a role in the consolidation of the European airline industry, given that we're the biggest 
airline in Europe," O'Leary said.
He predicted that in five years' time there would be only four or five airline groups in Europe: Ryanair, Lufthansa, Air 
France-KLM, British Airways parent IAG and possibly Easyjet.
"Everything will all get consolidated into four or five big groups. It's always hard to predict the demise of an 
individual airline but that's what happens," he told Reuters.

Italy's troubled airline Alitalia on Tuesday got the word out in multiple newspapers and online on Tuesday that it has 
started looking for binding purchase offers from interested buyers.
The airline, which filed for insolvency in May, is soliciting offers from August 7 to September 15, though they would 
be welcome until October 2 at the latest.
Those interested can make an offer either for the entire airline, or only for the air operations or the ground services, 
Alitalia said.
However, the Italian government would give preference to a complete sale offer, according to Ansa news agency.
The deadline for non-binding offers for the airline expired in July.
Low-cost European carrier Ryanair was one of several companies that had expressed an interest and had made a 
non-binding offer for Alitalia's assets, said Ryanair financial head Neil Sorahan in July.
Alitalia has not turned a profit since 2002 and has been on the brink of collapse three times in the past 10 years. 
Privatized in 2008, it has since lost more than 2.5 billion euros (2.95 billion dollars).

Irish airline Ryanair plans to launch a Warsaw, Poland-based charter carrier next summer.
Ryanair Sun will initially have five Boeing 737-800s, a fleet that Ryanair intends to grow to 15 aircraft by summer 
2019.
It is still undecided whether the aircraft will come from Ryanair’s existing fleet or from its delivery stream, a 
spokesperson for the low-cost carrier tells Airfinance Journal.
Operating as a standalone business unit with a Polish air operator’s certificate, the new carrier will offer charter 
flights to and from Poland from summer 2018.
“Ryanair Sun will deliver best in class charter services, at the lowest cost to Polish tour operators,” the airline says 
in a statement.
Recruitment is underway for senior management of the business unit, Ryanair says.

A government bridge loan to pay insolvent Air Berlin has not yet been paid but the process of providing the debt is 
on schedule, according to a spokesperson for Germany's economy ministry.
"There are a few technical details but the credit is there and everything is progressing according to the timetable," 
the spokeswoman told reporters at a government news conference in Berlin.
The government has agreed a &euro;150 million ($179 million) loan to ensure that flights continue for three months 
and to secure the positions of the airline's 7,200 employees in Germany.
The airline filed for bankruptcy earlier in August after Etihad Airways, its second-largest stakeholder, withdrew 
funding after years of losses. The airline is now being split up among investors, with bids due in mid-September, 
according to Reuters.
Easyjet, Ryanair, Lufthansa and TUI are all reportedly interested in trying to acquire some of Air Berlin’s fleet. 
Reuters reports that Lufthansa is looking for around a dozen of Air Berlin’s 17 long-haul aircraft that fly transatlantic 
routes.
Air Berlin has 17 Airbus A330s, 10 of which are on lease from AerCap, according to Airfinance Journal’s Fleet

One of the aviation industry's most colourful wagers has been reignited. In 2012, Willie Walsh, chief executive of 
International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, bet Sir Richard Branson a "knee in the groin" that the 
Virgin Atlantic brand would disappear within five years, after US airline Delta Air Lines bought a 49 per cent stake in 
the British carrier.
On Thursday Sir Richard reminded Mr Walsh of the bet as he revealed a deal that he believes will safeguard the 
Virgin Atlantic brand in the face of growing transatlantic competition, despite it meaning he will lose majority control 
of the airline he founded in 1984.
In a wide-ranging shake-up of the airline industry, Air France-KLM will buy a 31 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic from 
Sir Richard's Virgin Group for about £220m, taking Sir Richard's stake in the airline from 51 per cent to 20 per cent.
In a letter to staff on Thursday, Sir Richard wrote: "Well Willie, that fiveyear point is up this December. And Virgin 
Atlantic is still flying strong!" The partnership deal, unveiled on Thursday, also sees Air France-KLM, Virgin Atlantic 
and Delta Air Lines sign a provisional agreement to create a single global joint venture. It involves Delta and China 
Eastern - in which Delta holds a stake - each acquiring a 10 per cent share of Air France-KLM, which will raise 
(EURO)751m in new capital for the Franco-Dutch carrier.

The goal of the deals between the four airlines is to create a formidable force on the lucrative transatlantic market, 
where competition is heating up due to the emergence of low-cost airlines Norwegian Air Shuttle and WestJet.
The single-partnership deal replaces two overlapping transatlantic joint ventures - one between Delta, Air France-
KLM and Alitalia and another between Delta and Virgin Atlantic.
Robin Byde, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, believes the new tie-up is going to be a "competitive threat", noting that 
there will be more pressure on yields, service quality and frequencies in the north Atlantic.
According to data from CAPA Centre for Aviation and OAG, the merger of the two transatlantic joint ventures will 
see the new alliance increase its share of seats between Europe and North America to 25 per cent, coming close to 
the largest alliance, Star, led by Lufthansa and United Airlines, which has a 27.9 per cent share of the market.
Oneworld alliance, which is made up of BA and American Airlines, has a 20.2 per cent share, based on data for 
summer 2017.
The shake-up comes in the midst of growing consolidation in the European market. Ryanair, easyJet and Etihad are 
among several airlines to have made a non-binding offer for Alitalia, the struggling Italian carrier that entered 
administration in May. Air Berlin, which has failed to make a profit for years, is also seeking buyers.
"There's always been code-shares, alliances and joint ventures between airlines, but I think you are seeing an 
acceleration of that. If you look at the US carriers, they are far more consolidated than the European market, so you 
are bound to see more in Europe," says Mr Byde.
The focus on joint ventures and minority stakes is largely down to the difficulty in doing full-scale cross-border 
mergers because of rules restricting foreign ownership.
Creating a stronger joint venture on the transatlantic network has become a more pressing issue in recent years.
Low-cost rivals such as Norwegian and WestJet have been successful in launching low fares between Europe and 
the US. IAG has responded by launching its own low-cost long-haul airline, Level, in June.
"Until recently, everyone thought the transatlantic market was stitched up between the three big joint ventures. But 
suddenly you've got all these lowcost guys and everyone became a lot less secure of their position," says Andrew 
Charlton, a Geneva-based aviation analyst.
On Friday, American Airlines, which has a joint venture with BA on transatlantic routes, highlighted the tough 
environment at its results presentation, noting that "the overall environment remains challenged as low-cost carriers 
grow substantially".
While many believe the new single joint venture is a sensible move, some are sceptical about the benefits. Gerald 
Khoo, analyst at Liberum, notes that airlines taking strategic minority stakes in other airlines is "a strategy with an 
alarmingly high failure rate".
"Bringing Virgin Atlantic into the transatlantic joint venture ought to be positive, but we struggle to see how buying a 
stake is either necessary or desirable," says Mr Khoo. "The most recent and enthusiastic practitioner, Etihad, has 
recently written off $808m for its failed investments in Air Berlin and Alitalia. Admittedly, Delta and Air France-KLM 
may be able to exercise significant influence with a combined 80 per cent shareholding."
Chris Tarry, an aviation consultant, believes Air France-KLM's purchase of a stake in Virgin Atlantic is a "massive 
diversion" from the Franco-Dutch carrier's core problems. "It's been a serial under-performer. Taking a stake in 
another airline is not going to change that," he says.
Virgin alliance flies in face of low-cost carriers Airlines. Joint ventures ; Tie-up with Air France - KLM aims to

Earlier this year Air France-KLM promised to cut costs and boost passenger capacity in an effort to "regain the 
offensive" in the long-haul market. Last year Jean-Marc Janaillac, its chief executive, told the FT that if the company 
did not become more competitive it would "end up like Alitalia", the struggling Italian flag carrier.
But Delta's move to take a 10 per cent stake in Air France-KLM, which also gives it a board seat, may be helpful in 
boosting the Franco-Dutch airline's fortunes.

boosting the Franco-Dutch airline's fortunes.

One of the aviation industry's most colourful wagers has been reignited. In 2012, Willie Walsh, chief executive of 
International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, bet Sir Richard Branson a "knee in the groin" that the 
Virgin Atlantic brand would disappear within five years, after US airline Delta Air Lines bought a 49 per cent stake in 
the British carrier.
On Thursday Sir Richard reminded Mr Walsh of the bet as he revealed a deal that he believes will safeguard the 
Virgin Atlantic brand in the face of growing transatlantic competition, despite it meaning he will lose majority control 
of the airline he founded in 1984.
In a wide-ranging shake-up of the airline industry, Air France-KLM will buy a 31 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic from 
Sir Richard's Virgin Group for about £220m, taking Sir Richard's stake in the airline from 51 per cent to 20 per cent.
In a letter to staff on Thursday, Sir Richard wrote: "Well Willie, that fiveyear point is up this December. And Virgin 
Atlantic is still flying strong!" The partnership deal, unveiled on Thursday, also sees Air France-KLM, Virgin Atlantic 
and Delta Air Lines sign a provisional agreement to create a single global joint venture. It involves Delta and China 
Eastern - in which Delta holds a stake - each acquiring a 10 per cent share of Air France-KLM, which will raise 
(EURO)751m in new capital for the Franco-Dutch carrier.

The goal of the deals between the four airlines is to create a formidable force on the lucrative transatlantic market, 
where competition is heating up due to the emergence of low-cost airlines Norwegian Air Shuttle and WestJet.
The single-partnership deal replaces two overlapping transatlantic joint ventures - one between Delta, Air France-
KLM and Alitalia and another between Delta and Virgin Atlantic.
Robin Byde, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, believes the new tie-up is going to be a "competitive threat", noting that 
there will be more pressure on yields, service quality and frequencies in the north Atlantic.
According to data from CAPA Centre for Aviation and OAG, the merger of the two transatlantic joint ventures will 
see the new alliance increase its share of seats between Europe and North America to 25 per cent, coming close to 
the largest alliance, Star, led by Lufthansa and United Airlines, which has a 27.9 per cent share of the market.
Oneworld alliance, which is made up of BA and American Airlines, has a 20.2 per cent share, based on data for 
summer 2017.
The shake-up comes in the midst of growing consolidation in the European market. Ryanair, easyJet and Etihad are 
among several airlines to have made a non-binding offer for Alitalia, the struggling Italian carrier that entered 
administration in May. Air Berlin, which has failed to make a profit for years, is also seeking buyers.
"There's always been code-shares, alliances and joint ventures between airlines, but I think you are seeing an 
acceleration of that. If you look at the US carriers, they are far more consolidated than the European market, so you 
are bound to see more in Europe," says Mr Byde.
The focus on joint ventures and minority stakes is largely down to the difficulty in doing full-scale cross-border 
mergers because of rules restricting foreign ownership.
Creating a stronger joint venture on the transatlantic network has become a more pressing issue in recent years.
Low-cost rivals such as Norwegian and WestJet have been successful in launching low fares between Europe and 
the US. IAG has responded by launching its own low-cost long-haul airline, Level, in June.
"Until recently, everyone thought the transatlantic market was stitched up between the three big joint ventures. But 
suddenly you've got all these lowcost guys and everyone became a lot less secure of their position," says Andrew 
Charlton, a Geneva-based aviation analyst.
On Friday, American Airlines, which has a joint venture with BA on transatlantic routes, highlighted the tough 
environment at its results presentation, noting that "the overall environment remains challenged as low-cost carriers 
grow substantially".
While many believe the new single joint venture is a sensible move, some are sceptical about the benefits. Gerald 
Khoo, analyst at Liberum, notes that airlines taking strategic minority stakes in other airlines is "a strategy with an 
alarmingly high failure rate".
"Bringing Virgin Atlantic into the transatlantic joint venture ought to be positive, but we struggle to see how buying a 
stake is either necessary or desirable," says Mr Khoo. "The most recent and enthusiastic practitioner, Etihad, has 
recently written off $808m for its failed investments in Air Berlin and Alitalia. Admittedly, Delta and Air France-KLM 
may be able to exercise significant influence with a combined 80 per cent shareholding."
Chris Tarry, an aviation consultant, believes Air France-KLM's purchase of a stake in Virgin Atlantic is a "massive 
diversion" from the Franco-Dutch carrier's core problems. "It's been a serial under-performer. Taking a stake in

Highlight: Web giant's parent Alphabet easily paid an EU fine that would have crippled other multinationals
Body
In the space of a single financial quarter, Google and its parent company Alphabet have had to deal with a boycott 
from some of the world’s biggest advertisers and a multibillion-euro fine from the European Commission. But 
neither of those is the biggest issue facing the company right now.
The €2.42 billion ($2.7 billion) fine certainly took a bite out of Alphabet’s quarterly profit. Results published during 
the week showed the regulatory intervention pushed its net income down to $4.5 billion from $4.8 billion for the 
same period in 2016. There can be few greater illustrations of Google’s power and scale, however, than the fact it 
can swallow such a massive fine out of a single quarter’s income and still have plenty of change. Consider that it 
would have taken the the bulk of the combined annual profit of the two largest companies on the Irish Stock 
Exchange, CRH and Ryanair, to pay such a bill.
If the powerful hand of the EU’s competition regulator managed briefly to slow Google’s march, it’s hard to divine 
whether the boycott by advertisers of its subsidiary YouTube earlier this year had any meaningful financial impact at 
all.
Some of the biggest-spending US and international brands withheld ads from YouTube as an investigation by The 
Times revealed their spots had aired alongside inappropriate content such as hate speech videos featuring white 
supremacist and Holocaust denier David Duke.
Alphabet mustered a swift response. Senior executives were out quickly to apologise. They promised to do more to 
weed out offensive content and protect advertisers from having their brands tarred by association with it.
The results show the controversy is well behind YouTube already. Google’s total ad revenue topped $22.6 billion for 
the three months to the end of June, up from €19.1 billion in the same period last year. Apart from the headline 
figures, Alphabet publishes two key metrics on which the company tracks its performance: paid clicks and cost per 
click. Paid clicks indicates the level of engagement and the degree to which ads are effective in drumming up 
Google figures still rising despite price pressure
business across the various Google properties (including YouTube, Gmail and so on) and what the company calls 
its “network members’ properties” - literally the websites on which Google buys space for brands. Cost per click, 
then, is the average amount Google charges advertisers for each click or engagement by users.
Right now, the numbers could scarcely be better. Paid click growth was up 52 per cent year-on-year during the 
second quarter. The pace has picked up too. This time last year it stood at 28 per cent. The stats show it’s higher 
still for paid clicks on Google’s own properties, at 61 per cent. What takes a little bit of the gloss off this 
performance, though, is the stubborn trend for cost-per-click numbers to move in the opposite direction. The 
consensus forecast for the decline in cost-per-click for this recent financial quarter was 15 per cent. In the event it 
was significantly worse at 23 per cent.
The main reason for this is the ongoing shift in web traffic to mobile devices. Google, ironically, has been a 
significant enabler of the shift through its Android mobile operating system. Google dominates search on desktop 
computers but the mobile user experience is very different, based as it is largely on self-contained apps rather than 
web browsers. Google and its various subsidiaries are battling with Facebook, and others, to retain the attention 
from users it can take for granted on PCs.
That competition means the margins (reflected in the cost-per-click figures) aren’t as fat for Google in mobile 
advertising as they were in the desktop-dominated past.
Mobile click-through rates for ads are also lower, which is in no small part down to relatively poor user experience. 
In this sense, Google is the Ryanair of the online advertising world.
It is benefiting from massive volume growth and has scale on its side. Like Ryanair, it’s also trying to improve the 
user experience, with some success. So just as Ryanair can post profit growth even when average ticket prices are 
falling, Google’s bottom line is still heading rapidly in the right direction even as the average ad price is under 
pressure.
On a conference call with investors last week, Alphabet’s chief financial officer Ruth Porat batted away concerns 
about the cost-per-click conundrum. The company is focused on growing revenue “not margins”, she said. Some of 
those investors, at least, would like to see the company do both.
The 3 per cent drop in its share price following the results announcement said as much. But with advertising 
revenue rolling in at over $20 billion per quarter and (still) rising, Google has both the time and the resources to 
search for a solution.

Aer Lingus owner IAG expects a double-digit rise in operating profit this year, it said on Friday, after a strong 
second quarter despite a power outage at BA which grounded hundreds of flights.
Shares rose 3% after the results, which included a year-on-year rise in profit that analysts said beat estimates.
Previously, the airline group, which also owns British Airways, Iberia and Vueling, had said that it expected an 
improvement in profit year-on-year in 2017.
Chief Executive Willie Walsh said that the first half performance was very strong, and struck a different tone to 
competitors such as Lufthansa, Ryanair and easyJet who have warned of a downward pressure on fares hindering 
performance.
"All we can say is what we see. Clearly what we see in terms of our performance does appear to be somewhat 
different to what others are saying," Walsh told reporters.
"It may not be different to what they're seeing, but it's certainly different to what they've said. But we're calling it as 
we see it, and our first half performance was very strong."
Air France-KLM also offered more optimism on pricing when it announced results on Friday.
IAG said that non-fuel unit costs before exceptional items were up, including the financial impact of a massive 
power outage which grounded flights at Heathrow and Gatwick over a holiday weekend in May.

But that did not detract significantly from a strong set of results, analysts said. Passenger unit revenue rose 1.5% in 
the quarter, delivering the first year-on-year increase in quarterly revenue per passenger mile flown since 2014.
Operating profit for the six months to June 30 was 975 million euros, up 37.3% compared to the previous year, 
while quarterly operating profit was 805 million euros.
Walsh said that a pact between Delta, Air France-KLM and Virgin, which was announced on Thursday, was unlikely 
to change much in the industry but that it was too early to say. (Reuters)

 European stocks may open higher on Tuesday as US Treasury yields climbed, oil extended overnight gains, and 
the dollar rebounded from its lowest level in more than a year in the wake of stronger-than-expected readings on 
US factory and services activity.
Oil rose further after climbing more than 1% in the overnight session as Saudi Arabia pledged to curb exports from 
August and Nigeria agreed to curb production to rein in global oversupply.
Also, Haliburton Co's executive chairman said the US shale drilling boom would probably ease next year.
The Fed's two-day policy meeting starts later Tuesday, with investors looking for clues on whether the US central 
bank will begin reducing its bond portfolio at its September meeting.
Meanwhile, Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor, told Senate investigators on 
Monday he had contacts with Russian officials four times last year, but he nor anyone in the Trump campaign team 
colluded with Moscow to influence the 2016 US election.
In economic releases, investors await a key survey of business sentiment from Germany later in the day.
Asian stocks are trading mostly higher, although gains remained muted outside Australia ahead of Fed meeting.
Overnight, US stocks ended mixed as investors braced for a busy week of earnings and a meeting of the Federal 
Reserve. The Dow dropped 0.3% and the S&P 500 edged down 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4% to 
close at a fresh record high.
European markets hit two-week lows on Monday after Ryanair warned of increased competition and EU antitrust 
regulators said they are investigating allegations of a cartel among a group of German carmakers.

Ryanair may cut its fares in late summer by as much as 9% from last year

Ryanair warned rivals on Monday that it may cut its fares in late summer by as much as 9% from last year, 
triggering a share sell-off by investors concerned about the impact on profitability.
Ryanair also confirmed it was among the bidders for Alitalia but said it would only pursue a deal if the struggling 
airline was restructured and Italian government influence removed.
Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, Ryanair has helped drive down short-haul ticket prices in Europe by 
increasing its capacity by a third, or about 30 million seats, in the past two years.
Some investors thought higher fares in the three months to the end of June were a sign that a period of heavy 
discounting may be ending. But management made clear the annual increase was just a blip due to the timing of 
Easter and that prices would fall sharply in the coming months.
"It's a competitive market out there. You're looking at fares down anywhere between 7, 8, maybe as much as 9%," , 
Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan told Reuters, referring to then three months to the end of September.
Annual falls are likely to average 8% in the six months to March 31, the end of Ryanair's financial year, he added.
While the average fare forecasts were unchanged from those given in May, some analysts had been expecting the 
declines to slow and Ryanair's share price was down 2.4% at 1245 GMT after earlier falling 4.5%.
"I think the market had probably priced in that the fare guidance for the winter was very conservative and now they 
are realizing that it is actually realistic," said Davy transport analyst Stephen Furlong.
Ryanair may cut its fares in late summer by as much as 9% from last year
The comments sent shares in other European airlines down on Monday, continuing falls seen last week, with 
Lufthansa , Wizz, IAG and easyJet losing between 1 and 3%.
Ryanair beat analyst expectations with profit of 397 million euros for the three months to the end of June, compared 
to a company poll average of 366 million euros, after the timing of Easter helped lift fares by 1 percent on an annual 
basis.
But its forecast that it would make a profit after tax of between 1.4 and 1.45 billion euros in its financial year was 
below the average forecast by analysts polled by Ryanair ahead of the release for a profit of 1.488 billion.
Sorohan said part of the fall in average fares was due to lower fuel prices, but much was due to over-capacity in 
Spain, Portugal and Italy as charter carriers shift capacity away from Turkey and North Africa.
Lower average fares were impacted by sterling weakness and lower fees earned for checked bags following a 
change in policy that allows passengers to carry two bags on board.
Low-cost rivals easyJet and Wizz Air have both in recent weeks warned that average fare levels would continue to 
be under pressure over the key summer period.
In a sign it is not afraid of increasing capacity into a weak market for fares, Ryanair nudged up its traffic forecast for 
the year to the end of March to 131 million passengers from an earlier forecast of 130 million.
"There are a few guys out there who look like they are starting to find life difficult," Sorahan said.
Analysts from Goodbody said Ryanair's tactics would increase pressure on carriers such as Alitalia, Air Berlin , 
Monarch and Norwegian Air Shuttle.
"The read on this is that they see demand weakening substantially and need to stimulate growth through 
aggressive pricing," they said in a note. (Reuters)

       NEW DELHI (dpa-AFX) - Indian shares may open a tad higher on Tuesday after the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) retained its forecast on India's GDP growth at 7.2 percent for the current fiscal and the Competition 
Commission of India approved the proposed merger between Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, paving the way for 
much-needed consolidation in the telecom sector that has been hit badly due to aggressive play by new entrant 
Reliance Jio.  There is also some cheer on the earnings front as cement manufacturer Ambuja Cements beat Street 
estimates by reporting an increase of 12 percent in its net profit for the June quarter, driven by increased sales as a 
result of value-based pricing.  On the other hand, Bharti Infratel's Q1 consolidated results for the quarter came in 
largely in-line with estimates. 
  Benchmark indexes Sensex and the Nifty hit fresh record highs in intraday trading on Monday before finishing 
higher by 0.7 percent and half a percent, respectively on earnings optimism. The rupee, however, weakened by 2 
paise to close at 64.34 per dollar.   Asian stocks are trading mixed this morning and the dollar recovered from a 13-
month low ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting starting later in the day.   Oil prices extended overnight gains after 
Saudi Arabia pledged to curb exports from August and Nigeria agreed to curb production to rein in global 
oversupply.  Also, Haliburton Co's executive chairman said the U.S. shale drilling boom would probably ease next 
year.  U.S. stocks ended mixed overnight as Markit PMI and housing data painted a mixed picture of the economy 
and investors braced for a busy week of earnings and a meeting of the Federal Reserve.   The Dow dropped 0.3 
percent and the S&P 500 edged down 0.1 percent while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 percent to close at a fresh 
record high.  European markets hit two-week lows on Monday after Ryanair warned of increased competition and 
EU antitrust regulators said they are investigating allegations of a cartel among a group of German carmakers.  The 
pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index shed 0.2 percent, the German DAX slid 0.3 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 
100 lost 1 percent while France's CAC 40 index edged up 0.2 percent.

EasyJet retreats after Ryanair warns of late-summer price war London

EasyJet was caught in the chill winds of Ryanair's warning of a late-summer price war among Europe's short-haul 
carriers with shares sliding across the sector.
Airline declines - including those of British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines - helped to push UK 
stocks to their worst performance in more than a month as investors were cowed by Ryanair's claims that prices 
could fall in the second half of the year.
"Ryanair has delivered a wake-up call to the industry," said Ken Odeluga, of City Index.
EasyJet retreated 2.8 per cent to £12.75, piling on the woes from last Thursday's badly received thirdquarter results 
that saw the shares slide nearly 6 per cent, as upgrades to fullyear guidance were overshadowed by caution on 
excess capacity.
But Cantor Fitzgerald's Robin Byde described the sell-off as "natural profittaking following two quarters of strong 
outperformance".
"We think risks are still on the upside," he said.
"EasyJet's fundamentals are sound and demand for leisure travel across Europe remains buoyant. It has now 
secured an air operator certificate in Austria to offset some of the risks of Brexit," he added, reiterating "buy" advice 
and a new target price of £16.

IAG pared early losses of above 2 per cent to close down 0.8 per cent at 585.5p while Ryanair fell 1.1 per cent to 
(EURO)17.85.
The losses in Dublin were despite Europe's biggest low-cost airline reporting a 55 per cent profit rise - pricing 
worries adding to falling bag revenue, adverse sterling impacts and fears over Brexit.
But Ryanair shares have gained more than 24 per cent year-to-date, said Ipek Ozkardeskaya at LCG, noting that a 
Bloomberg survey had found 76 per cent of analysts were long on the stock.
The FTSE 100 fell 1 per cent, off 75.18 points, to 7,377.73, disappointing hopes of a push above Friday's one-
month highs.
"The FTSE has been hit by news of a 0.3 per cent downgrade to the IMF forecast for UK GDP growth this year," 
added David Cheetham at XTB.
Reckitt Benckiser led the blue-chip fallers as USB analyst Pinar Ergun described second-quarter results as 
"disappointing for a company like RB" with sales still weighed by a cyber attack last month.
Its shares sank 3.3 per cent to £76.23. ITV fell 1 per cent to 175.5p despite Liberum lauding the success of its hit 
Love Island.
"The show also offers good international content revenue opportunities and may allay some of the concerns over 
whether ITV's content acquisition strategy is working," analyst Ian Whittaker said, recommending "buy" at a 320p 
target price.

A recent study from the US suggests 3D-printed airline seat frames could cut their weight by as much as half. That 
is equivalent to one passenger per short-haul flight. Maybe good news to some airlines but to Ryanair it remains 
science fiction. Europe's leading lowcost carrier is well practised in lightening its load. Yesterday's firstquarter 
results underscored its cost advantage over many peers.
Ryanair reported better than expected revenues, and after-tax profits of (EURO)397m beat analyst expectations by 
about 8 per cent. Operating margin swelled by 6 percentage points to 24 per cent, its best for a first quarter. The 
market had expected a good result: the shares fell as much as 4 per cent on the day. But Ryanair's typical Eeyore-
ish outlook on airfares, a drop of 5 per cent in the first half and even more later in the year, does not fully explain the 
reaction.
Frankly, Ryanair's valuation already incorporates plenty of hope. On a price to forward earnings multiple of 15 
times, the Irish carrier trades not so far from its five-year highs. It is not alone. Valuations have risen for rivals such 
as easyJet. Macro factors have played their part. A rise in the pound, which suits UK holiday makers, plus lower oil 
costs, has boosted European airline shares this year.
Yet just a bit of leaden gloom from Ryanair, and its competitors, on fares has caused the sector to sell off. Another 
reason may be that jet fuel prices have stopped descending and are up 7 per cent year on year. This is the first time 
jet fuel has managed this during the summer since 2014.
Meanwhile, capacity is growing. Ryanair aims to reduce unit costs by increasing passenger capacity. It has ordered 
an extra 10 jets in June, adding to 183 aircraft already on order. Its fleet will rise by three-quarters by 2024.

For Ryanair, the airline business is about putting bottoms on seats. As the valuation soars, it appears shareholders 
are sitting far from comfortably in theirs.

A recent study from the US suggests 3D-printed airline seat frames could cut their weight by as much as half. That 
is equivalent to one passenger per short-haul flight. Maybe good news to some airlines but to Ryanair it remains 
science fiction. Europe's leading lowcost carrier is well practised in lightening its load. Yesterday's firstquarter 
results underscored its cost advantage over many peers.
Ryanair reported better than expected revenues, and after-tax profits of (EURO)397m beat analyst expectations by 
about 8 per cent. Operating margin swelled by 6 percentage points to 24 per cent, its best for a first quarter. The 
market had expected a good result: the shares fell as much as 4 per cent on the day. But Ryanair's typical Eeyore-
ish outlook on airfares, a drop of 5 per cent in the first half and even more later in the year, does not fully explain the 
reaction.
Frankly, Ryanair's valuation already incorporates plenty of hope. On a price to forward earnings multiple of 15 
times, the Irish carrier trades not so far from its five-year highs. It is not alone. Valuations have risen for rivals such 
as easyJet. Macro factors have played their part. A rise in the pound, which suits UK holiday makers, plus lower oil 
costs, has boosted European airline shares this year.
Yet just a bit of leaden gloom from Ryanair, and its competitors, on fares has caused the sector to sell off.
Another reason may be that jet fuel prices have stopped descending and are up 7 per cent year on year. This is the 
first time jet fuel has managed this during the summer since 2014.
Meanwhile, capacity is growing. Ryanair aims to reduce unit costs by increasing passenger capacity. It has ordered 
an extra 10 jets in June, adding to 183 aircraft already on order. Its fleet will rise by three-quarters by 2024.

EasyJet was caught in the chill winds of Ryanair's warning of a late-summer price war among Europe's short-haul 
carriers with shares sliding across the sector.
Airline declines - including those of British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines - helped to push UK 
stocks to their worst performance in more than a month as investors were cowed by Ryanair's claims that prices 
could fall in the second half of the year.
"Ryanair has delivered a wake-up call to the industry," said Ken Odeluga, of City Index.
EasyJet retreated 2.8 per cent to £12.75, piling on the woes from last Thursday's badly received thirdquarter results 
that saw the shares slide nearly 6 per cent, as upgrades to fullyear guidance were overshadowed by caution on 
excess capacity.
But Cantor Fitzgerald's Robin Byde described the sell-off as "natural profittaking following two quarters of strong 
outperformance".
"We think risks are still on the upside," he said.
"EasyJet's fundamentals are sound and demand for leisure travel across Europe remains buoyant. It has now 
secured an air operator certificate in Austria to offset some of the risks of Brexit," he added, reiterating "buy" advice 
and a new target price of £16.

IAG pared early losses of above 2 per cent to close down 0.8 per cent at 585.5p while Ryanair fell 1.1 per cent to 
(EURO)17.85.
The losses in Dublin were despite Europe's biggest low-cost airline reporting a 55 per cent profit rise - pricing 
worries adding to falling bag revenue, adverse sterling impacts and fears over Brexit.
But Ryanair shares have gained more than 24 per cent year-to-date, said Ipek Ozkardeskaya at LCG, noting that a 
Bloomberg survey had found 76 per cent of analysts were long on the stock.
The FTSE 100 fell 1 per cent, off 75.18 points, to 7,377.73, disappointing hopes of a push above Friday's one-
month highs.
"The FTSE has been hit by news of a 0.3 per cent downgrade to the IMF forecast for UK GDP growth this year," 
added David Cheetham at XTB.
Reckitt Benckiser led the blue-chip fallers as USB analyst Pinar Ergun described second-quarter results as 
"disappointing for a company like RB" with sales still weighed by a cyber attack last month.
Its shares sank 3.3 per cent to £76.23. ITV fell 1 per cent to 175.5p despite Liberum lauding the success of its hit 
Love Island.
"The show also offers good international content revenue opportunities and may allay some of the concerns over 
whether ITV's content acquisition strategy is working," analyst Ian Whittaker said, recommending "buy" at a 320p 
target price.

Ryanair is one of several airlines to have made a bid for Alitalia ahead of a fullscale tender process for the 
lossmaking Italian carrier in the coming weeks.
Yesterday Europe's biggest low-cost airline confirmed that it had submitted a non-binding offer for Alitalia, which 
collapsed into administration on May 2 after employees voted to reject a restructuring plan involving salary 
reductions and job cuts.
Neil Sorahan, chief financial officer at Ryanair, refused to provide details of the offer but said the Irish airline had 
decided it was right to be involved in the bidding process.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, previously said Ryanair was interested in pursuing Alitalia only if it was 
restructured by its commissioners. "We're the largest carrier in Italy ... so we're very serious about anything to do 
with Italy," said Mr Sorahan.
Etihad, which has a large stake in Alitalia, and easyJet have also made nonbinding bids, according to people close 
to the process.
Ryanair's expression of interest comes at an early stage of the bidding process for the Italian airline, with final offers 
not expected before the end of October.
Ryanair bids for Alitalia before tender launch Airlines ; Non-binding offer comes as 55% rise in quarterly profits

In recent weeks bankers at Rothschild advising Alitalia have opened their data to prospective buyers, mainly to 
gauge what kind of deal is possible, whether a full or piecemeal sale.
But the auction will not get into full swing until Alitalia's three commissioners produce the tender for the sale process 
in the coming weeks. Any entity, including those that had not make a non-binding offer in the first round, could jump 
in with offers in the final stage, said one person familiar with the matter.
The Italian government has ruled out nationalisation after ploughing in (EURO)600m this year to keep Alitalia afloat. 
But Rome may decide to keep a stake in the airline, depending on the outcome of the sales process.
Ryanair's bid comes as it became the latest European airline to warn of a tough outlook. The airline said fares 
would remain under pressure for the rest of the year, even as it reported a jump in first-quarter profits.
Yesterday Europe's biggest low-cost airline reported a 55 per cent profit rise to (EURO)397m in the three months to 
June 30, up from (EURO)256m a year ago, beating consensus forecasts of (EURO)366m. Revenues rose 13 per 
cent to (EURO)1.91bn. The shares closed down 1 per cent at (EURO)17.85.
Ryanair said the increase in profit was largely a result of the late Easter in April. It cautioned that ticket prices would 
be "very competitive" for the rest of the year because of overcapacity.
A week ago easyJet and Lufthansa warned on the outlook for fares, while upgrading full-year profit forecasts While 
average fares had risen 1 per cent in the first quarter, Ryanair said it expected them to fall 5 per cent during the first 
half of the year and 8 per cent in the second half.
It kept its profit guidance at (EURO)1.4bn to (EURO)1.45bn for the full year.

BRITAIN'S top share index fell yesterday as heavyweight Reckitt Benckiser dropped following its results and as 
airlines were hit by price war worries.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index ended down one per cent at 7,377.73 points.
Consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser fell 3.3 per cent, the biggest FTSE loser, after second-quarter sales 
fell two per cent following last month's cyber attack, which disrupted its operations.
"We consider the quality of these results disappointing for a company like RB, and expect the stock to underperform 
today particularly given management's commentary around 2017 outlook," analysts at UBS said in a note.
Airlines also saw losses, with budget carrier Easyjet down 2.8 per cent and British Airway's operator IAG falling 0.8 
per cent after Irish peer Ryanair warned rivals that it may cut its late summer fares by as much as nine per cent 
compared with last year.
Ryanair also confirmed it was among the bidders for Alitalia but said it would only pursue a deal if the struggling 
airline was restructured and Italian government influence removed.
Shares in Micro Focus dropped to a nine-month low after it posted disappointing full-year results, but rose to be the 
biggest FTSE riser by the end of the session.
Blue-chip risers were dominated by more defensive stocks, with pharma firm Shire making modest gains.
Outside of the blue chips, mergers and acquisitions were in focus on the mid-cap index after B&M European Value 
Retail jumped 4.8 per cent on the back of a media report that Wal-Mart's Asda is considering a £4.4bn bid to take 
over the discount retailer.

The British mid cap index fell 0.7 per cent, led lower by a 20 per cent slump in Acacia Mining's shares following a 
spate of broker cuts in light of the gold miner's continuing troubles stemming from Tanzania's export ban.

IRISH airline Ryanair yesterday reported a 55 per cent rise in first quarter profits to (EURO)397m (£355m), but still 
urged caution, and warned it could move planes out of the UK if a Brexit deal is not agreed in good time.
The low-cost carrier also warned that increased competition will keep fares under pressure for the rest of the year, 
sending shares dipping.
The carrier beat expectations with its 55 per cent rise in first quarter profits, and posted a rise in revenues to 
(EURO)1.9bn, though Ryanair said the increase was predominantly due to the late Easter in April.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary also reiterated his warnings for aviation in the wake of the Brexit vote. Yesterday, 
he expressed concern that when the UK leaves "there may not be sufficient time, or goodwill on both sides, to 
negotiate a timely replacement bilateral [air deal]".
If there is not legal certainty over flights operating between the UK and EU by the autumn of 2018 (when the airline 
publishes its summer 2019 schedule), Ryanair could be forced to "cancel flights and move some - or all - of our UK 
aircraft to continental Europe from April '19 onwards", he added.

 European stock markets fell on Monday, with airline shares and automakers coming under selling pressure, after 
Ryanair warned of increased competition in the months ahead and EU antitrust regulators said they are 
investigating allegations of a cartel among a group of German carmakers.
Brexit worries, the recent strength of the euro and weak eurozone economic data indicating slower growth also 
dented investor sentiment ahead of the Fed's latest policy meeting, due this week.
The eurozone private sector started the third quarter on a solid footing but the pace of growth slowed for the second 
successive month in July, flash data from IHS Markit showed. The composite output index fell to a 6-month low of 
55.8 in July from 56.3 in June.
The pound advanced against the euro despite an IMF cut to its UK GDP growth forecast and data showing that the 
squeeze on UK household finances intensified in July.
The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was down half a percent at 378.22 in late opening deals after falling over 1% to 
log its biggest single-day loss in three weeks on Friday.
The German DAX was losing 0.7%, France's CAC 40 index was moving down 0.3% and the UK's FTSE 100 was 
declining 0.9%.
Automakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen tumbled 3-4% after reports that EU regulators are studying reports of 
cartel among German carmakers.
Ryanair lost 2.5% in London after the budget airline said it expects the pricing environment to remain very 
competitive in the second half of the year.
British Airways owner International Airlines Group fell as much as 5% and easyJet shed 2%.
Gemalto plunged 16% after the digital security company announced a goodwill impairment charge of around 
EUR420 million.
European Shares Extend Losses On Currency Woes
On the positive side, Philips Electronics shares rallied 3% in Amsterdam after the Dutch consumer electronics giant 
reported a rise in second-quarter net income from continuing operations on higher sales and orders.
Switzerland's third largest private bank Julius Baer jumped 7% on reporting a 6% rise in assets under management 
in the first six months of 2017.
B&M European Value Retail shares soared 4.2%. The Sunday Times reported that Asda, the UK supermarket arm 
of Wal-Mart Stores, is considering a GBP4.4 billion takeover of the British discount retailer.

 Stocks in London are called to open slightly lower on Monday, as sterling held firm over the weekend despite the 
IMF cutting its forecast for UK growth, while Ryanair reported a significant first-quarter profit increase. 
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index to open 2.41 points lower at 7,450.50. The blue-chip index closed 
down 0.5%, or 34.96 points, at 7,452.91 on Friday. 
The pound was quoted at USD1.3017 compared to USD1.2959 at the London equities close on Friday.
In economic news, the International Monetary Fund left its global growth projections unchanged in a quarterly 
update, but cut its US and UK view. 
The IMF left projections for global output growth unchanged at 3.5% this year and 3.6% in 2018, according to 
Monday's quarterly update of the IMF's forecast. 
"The recovery in global growth that we projected in April is on a firmer footing," said Maurice Obstfeld, chief 
economist at the Washington-based crisis lender. "There is now no question mark over the world economy's gain in 
momentum."
In the revision issued from Kuala Lumpur of its World Economic Outlook, the IMF raised its forecasts across the 
eurozone, as well as for emerging and developing Europe, China and Canada.
The most important lowered outlook was for the US, where the IMF slashed its expectations for expansionary 
federal budget policies, as President Donald Trump's plans for tax cuts and infrastructure projects have yet to gain 
traction in Congress. 
The revised IMF forecast is for US output to expand by 2.1% this year and next; three months ago, the outlook for 
2017-18 was 2.4%.
LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Lower Call As IMF Cuts US And UK Outlook
The IMF significantly pared its expectations through 2018 for Saudi Arabia, Brazil and the UK. The UK's output 
forecast was revised down to 1.7% from 2.0% in 2017. 
"The ultimate impact of Brexit on the UK remains unclear," Obstfeld said.
In early corporate news, budget airline Ryanair Holdings reported Monday its first-quarter profit after tax climbed 
55% to EUR397 million from last year's EUR256 million. The company attributed the growth in profit to the timing of 
Easter in first quarter, with no holiday period in the prior year comparative.
Revenue increased 13% to EUR1.91 billion from EUR1.69 billion last year.
Looking ahead, the company said it continues to guide fiscal 2018 profit after tax in a range of EUR1.40 billion to 
EUR1.45 billion. After a difficult winter last year, the company said it expects the pricing environment to remain very 
competitive into H2 where traffic will be higher by approximately 7%.
Meanwhile, Asda is exploring a GBP4.4 billion takeover of B&M European Value Retail SA, the FTSE 250-listed 
discount chain run by billionaire brothers Simon and Bobby Arora, The Sunday Times reported.
The UK's third-biggest supermarket chain, part of US retailing giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc, is understood to be in the 
early stages of assessing a bid for B&M, according to the newspaper. At its closing price of 340.27 pence per share 
on Friday, B&M had a market capitalisation of GBP3.40 billion, and The Times argued that "applying a normal 
takeover premium" would give a takeover price of about GBP4.4 billion.
The move follows J Sainsbury's purchase of retailer Argos last year, and Tesco's ongoing GBP3.70 billion 
acquisition of London-listed wholesaler Booker Group. 
Gold producer Randgold Resources said its Tongon gold mine in Cote d'Ivoire continues to ramp up production as 
it tracks its 2017 target of 285,000 ounces.
Chief Executive Mark Bristow said that, with Tongon now operating to plan, the company's focus had shifted to 
finding additional reserves and resources to replace depleted ounces and extend the mine's life beyond its current 
four-year horizon.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index is down 0.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.4%, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.5%.
Wall Street ended mostly flat on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.2% and the S&P 500 and 
the Nasdaq Composite both broadly flat.
The economic calendar on Monday is focused on Markit services and manufacturing PMIs for France at 0800 BST, 
Germany at 0830 BST, the Eurozone at 0900 BST and the US at 1445 BST. US existing home sales is at 1500 
BST.
Also in the corporate calendar on Monday are first-half results from consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser, B2B 
media and events company Ascential, and Temple Bar Investment Trust, while food producer Cranswick publishes 
first-quarter results.

European Stocks Decline Amid Reports of EU Probe into Alleged Collusion Among German Carmakers
European Stocks Decline Amid Reports of EU Probe into Alleged Collusion

 European stocks fell on Monday morning amid reports that EU antitrust regulators are investigating allegations of a 
cartel among a group of German carmakers. 
The European Commission said during the weekend that it had received information of the possible collusion, which 
it was now assessing, adding that it was premature to speculate further, according to news reports. 
The euro retreated from the two-year highs it reached last week after the latest purchasing managers' indexes 
(PMI)showed that euro-region economic growth lost some of its momentum in July for a second straight month. 
The headline IHS Markit Eurozone PMI fell for a second month in July, to a six-month low of 55.8 from 56.3 in June, 
according to the "flash" estimate, which is based on about 85% of final replies, IHS Markit, which compiles the 
survey, said on Monday. The reading nevertheless signals growth in the sector as readings above 50 denote 
expansion while those below imply contraction.
The International Monetary Fund raised its euro-area growth forecast for 2017 to 1.9% from 1.7% and it increased 
its forecast for the region for 2018 to 1.7% from 1.6%, while cutting its GDP growth estimates for the US and the 
UK, citing a weak first quarter. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index slipped 0.3% on Monday, after falling for a third straight session, as the 
possibility of further euro strength weighed on exporters and prompted bets among traders that the European 
Central Bank is close to beginning to taper its stimulus program. 
"It would be the ultimate irony that a continued recovery in European economic data, could be the catalyst to 
prompt further losses in European equity markets, as it would invite further pressure on European Central Bank 
officials to pullback from their ultra-accommodative stimulus measures," Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at 
CMC Markets in London, said by e-mail. 
European Stocks Decline Amid Reports of EU Probe into Alleged Collusion Among German Carmakers
In equities, Daimler, which makes Mercedes Benz cars, fell 3%, Volkswagen dropped 2.9% and BMW was down 
2.4% in Frankfurt. Peugeot Citroen fell 2.4% and Renault was down 1% in Paris as news of the German collusion 
probe reverberated across the sector. 
Dutch digital security company Gemalto was the biggest decliner in Europe's benchmark STOXX 600, falling 15.6% 
after saying on Friday that it expects to book a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately 420 million 
euros ($489 million) in the first semester of 2017 as a result of deteriorated prospects for the removable SIM 
market.
Ryanair fell 3.6% in Dublin and 3.2% in London after posting a 55% year-on-year rise in first quarter profit to 397 
million euros. The company also said that it expects the pricing environment to remain "very competitive" into the 
second half of its fiscal year, maintaining its expectation for second half average fare guidance of an 8% decline. 
UK rival EasyJet dropped 2.5% and British Airways owner IAG fell 2.4% in London. Lufthansa fell 0.7% in Frankfurt. 
French building material maker Lafarge Holcim gained 1.4% in Paris and German utility RWE rose 1.1% in 
Frankfurt. 
The euro-region blue-chip STOXX 50 fell 0.4% and the DAX in Frankfurt dropped 0.5%. The FTSE 100 in London 
fell 0.9% and the CAC 40 in Paris slid 0.3%.

 Stocks in London opened lower on Monday in the face of a firm pound and an IMF cut to UK and US growth 
forecasts, as cautious outlook statements knocked Ryanair and Reckitt Benckiser stocks despite the two firms 
reporting profit rises. 
The FTSE 100 index of large caps was down 0.4%, or 30.01 points at 7,422.90. The FTSE 250 index was down 
0.3% at 19,688.10 points, while the AIM All-Share index was flat at 969.92.
The BATS UK 100 index was down 0.4% at 12,598.95,  and the BATS 250 was down 0.1% at 17,928.04. The 
BATS Small Companies was flat at 12,110.10.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3008, gaining from USD1.2959 at the London equities close on Friday against a 
weak dollar.
Ryanair shares were down 4.4% in early trading, as despite a quarterly profit rise, the budget airline warned its 
fares will keep falling in the second-half. 
For the quarter ended June 30, pretax profit increased 55% to EUR397.0 million from EUR256.0 million for the 
same quarter the year before. Ryanair said it expects pretax profit for the full-year to be between EUR1.40 billion to 
EUR1.45 billion.
Quarterly revenue grew 13% to EUR1.91 billion from EUR1.69 billion as traffic rose 12% to 35.0 million from 31.2 
million.
However, the London-listed airline said it expects average fares to decline by about 5% for the first half of the 
financial year as it aims to grow traffic by almost 11%. Ryanair said it expects the pricing environment to remain 
"very competitive" into the second half, where it maintains its guidance for an average fare decline of 8%.

The fare guidance dragged down peers as well. easyJet was down 3.4% and International Consolidated Airlines 
down 2.2%. 
Reckitt Benckiser also faced selling despite reporting an interim profit rise, with the stock trading down 1.7%. The 
consumer goods firm said pretax profit in the first half of the year grew to GBP1.02 billion from GBP697.0 million the 
year before, as net revenue rose 14% to GBP5.02 billion from GBP4.39 billion.
Revenue was boosted by the depreciation of sterling against Reckitt's other selling currencies, but net revenue at 
constant exchange rates still rose by 2%.
On a like-for-like basis, however, net revenue slipped by 1%, due to Reckitt's IT systems being hit by global 
ransomware attack Petya and due to the implementation of a new Goods & Services Tax in India. Reckitt reiterated 
its full-year like-for-like net revenue target of 2% growth
In the FTSE 250, B&M European Value Retail was up 4.8% after a Sunday Times report that Asda is considering a 
takeover bid for the chain. The UK's third-biggest supermarket chain, part of US retailing giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc, 
is understood to be in the early stages of assessing a bid for B&M, according to the newspaper. 
At its closing price of 340.27 pence per share on Friday, B&M had a market capitalisation of GBP3.40 billion, and 
The Times argued that "applying a normal takeover premium" would give a takeover price of about GBP4.4 billion.
At the other end of the mid-cap index, Acacia Mining was down 8.3% after having its target price cut to 240.0 pence 
from 265.0p by Jefferies. The miner continues to struggle with legislative changes in Tanzania, seeing its interim 
revenue fall and cutting its production guidance last week. 
In economic news, the International Monetary Fund left its global growth projections unchanged in a quarterly 
update, but cut its US and UK view.
The IMF left projections for global output growth unchanged at 3.5% this year and 3.6% in 2018, according to 
Monday's quarterly update of the IMF's forecast.
"The recovery in global growth that we projected in April is on a firmer footing," said Maurice Obstfeld, chief 
economist at the Washington-based crisis lender. "There is now no question mark over the world economy's gain in 
momentum."
However, the IMF cut its forecast for US output to expansion of 2.1% this year and next; three months ago, the 
outlook for 2017-18 was 2.4%.
The reduction came as the the IMF slashed its expectations for expansionary federal budget policies, as President 
Donald Trump's plans for tax cuts and infrastructure projects have yet to gain traction in Congress.
The IMF also significantly pared its expectations through 2018 for Saudi Arabia, Brazil and the UK. The UK's output 
forecast was revised down to 1.7% from 2.0% in 2017.
"The ultimate impact of Brexit on the UK remains unclear," Obstfeld said.
Work will begin on preparing the ground for a post-Brexit trade deal with the US when the UK international trade 
secretary flies into Washington. Liam Fox will meet trade representative Robert Lighthizer for two days of talks at 
the first UK-US trade and investment working group.
European Union rules mean the UK cannot sign a deal until after it has quit the bloc but the discussions will pave 
the way for a future potential free trade agreement.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 index in Paris was flat and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was down 0.4%.

France's private sector output grew at the slowest pace in six months in July, flash survey data from IHS Markit 
showed Monday. The composite output index fell to a 6-month low of 55.7 in July from 56.6 in June. Nonetheless, a 
score above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. Softer increases in output were seen across both manufacturers 
and service providers in July.
The economic calendar on Monday continues with Markit services and manufacturing PMIs for Germany at 0830 
BST, the Eurozone at 0900 BST and the US at 1445 BST. Elsewhere in the economic calendar on Monday, US 
existing home sales is at 1500 BST.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.6%. In China, the Shanghai Composite ended up 0.4%, 
while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.5%.
The manufacturing sector in Japan continued to expand in June, albeit at a slightly slower pace, the latest survey 
from Nikkei revealed on Monday with an eight-month low manufacturing PMI score of 52.2. That was down from 
52.4 in June.
Wall Street ended mostly flat on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.2% and the S&P 500 and

 Stocks in London are seen opening lower on Monday, as the pound remains firm despite an IMF cut to its 
economic forecasts for the UK and the US, while Reckitt Benckiser and Ryanair kicked off a busy week of corporate 
earnings with significant profit rises. 
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index to open 9.61 points lower at 7,443.00. The blue-chip index closed 
down 0.5%, or 34.96 points, at 7,452.91 on Friday.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3006 compared to USD1.2959 at the London equities close on Friday.
Consumer goods firm Reckitt Benckiser reported pretax profit of GBP1.02 billion for the six months to June 30, 
rising significantly from GBP697.0 million in the same period in 2016. 
Net revenue from continuing operations 14% to GBP5.02 billion from GBP4.39 billion year-on-year. However, in 
constant currencies this represented 2% revenue growth, and in like-for-like terms the company saw revenue dip 
1%. 
As previously reported, Reckitt Benckiser has adjusted its full-year net revenue target to growth of 2%, down from 
3%, following the impact of a cyber-attack. 
Budget airline Ryanair Holdings reported Monday its first-quarter profit after tax climbed 55% to EUR397 million 
from last year's EUR256 million. The company attributed the growth in profit to the timing of Easter in first quarter,

ago, the outlook for 2017-18 was 2.4%.
The reduction came as the  the IMF slashed its expectations for expansionary federal budget policies, as President 
Donald Trump's plans for tax cuts and infrastructure projects have yet to gain traction in Congress. 
The IMF also significantly pared its expectations through 2018 for Saudi Arabia, Brazil and the UK. The UK's output 
forecast was revised down to 1.7% from 2.0% in 2017. 
"The ultimate impact of Brexit on the UK remains unclear," Obstfeld said.
Work will begin on preparing the ground for a post-Brexit trade deal with the US when the UK international trade 
secretary flies into Washington.
Liam Fox will meet trade representative Robert Lighthizer for two days of talks at the first UK-US trade and 
investment working group.
European Union rules mean the UK cannot sign a deal until after it has quit the bloc but the discussions will pave 
the way for a future potential free trade agreement.
Fox said: "The first meeting of the UK-US trade and investment working group is the start of the next chapter in our 
special relationship.

 The majority of the European markets ended the first trading day of the new week in negative territory. Airline 
stocks were under pressure after Ryanair warned of increased competition in the months ahead. Automakers also 
weakened after EU antitrust regulators said they are investigating allegations of a cartel among a group of German 
carmakers.
Traders were also in a cautious mood ahead of the upcoming policy statement from the Federal Reserve on 
Wednesday. The Fed is widely expected to leave rates unchanged, but traders will be keeping a close watch on the 
accompanying statement for any clues about future rate hikes.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 0.41%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip 
stocks increased 0.04%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 0.44%.

1.01% and the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 0.45%.

studying reports of cartel among German carmakers. 
In Paris, Renault dropped 0.31% and rival Peugeot fell 1.30%.
In London, Ryanair lost 1.38% after the budget airline said it expects the pricing environment to remain very 
competitive in the second half of the year. British Airways owner International Airlines Group fell 0.76% and easyJet 
shed 2.82%.
Reckitt Benckiser Group declined 3.27% after the consumer goods giant reduced its annual net revenue target to

Wal-Mart Stores, is considering a 4.4 billion pounds ($5.7 billion) takeover of the British discount retailer.

from continuing operations on higher sales and orders.
Julius Baer jumped 4.47% in Zurich after reporting a 6% rise in assets under management in the first six months of 
2017.
Eurozone private sector started the third quarter on a solid footing, but the pace of growth slowed for the second 
successive month in July, largely due to the moderation in the manufacturing sector. The composite output index

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported Monday that its first-
quarter profit after tax climbed 55 percent to 397 million euros from last year's 256 million euros. Earnings per share 
grew 63 percent to 32.66 euro cents from 20.01 euro cents a year ago. 
 The company attributed the growth in profit to the timing of Easter in first quarter, with no holiday period in the prior 
year comparative.   Revenues increased 13 percent to 1.91 billion euros from 1.69 billion euros last year.  Traffic 
grew 12% to 35 million customers from last year's 31.2 million, as Ryanair's lower fares and 'Always Getting Better' 
or AGB programme delivered a record 96% load factor, up 2 percent.  Looking ahead, the company said it 
continues to guide fiscal 2018 profit after tax in a range of 1.40 billion euros to 1.45 billion euros. This guidance 
remains heavily dependent on close-in summer bookings, H2 ave. fares, and the absence of any further security 
events, ATC strikes or negative Brexit developments.  Further, the company said that it is raising FY18 traffic target 
to 131 million, up 1 million on previous guidance, thanks to the higher first quarter load factors and the completion 
of winter '17 schedule. After a difficult winter last year, the company said it expects the pricing environment to 
remain very competitive into H2 where traffic will be higher by approximately 7%.

Ryanair has today reported a 55% rise in first quater profit to €397m. This result is distorted by the timing of Easter 
in the first quarter with no holiday period in the prior year comparative.  
Traffic grew 12% to 35m as Ryanair’s lower fares and “Always Getting Better” (AGB) programme delivered a record 
96% load factor.    Ryanair’s balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry. In May, the Board 
approved a €600m ordinary share buyback programme. The airline continues to invest heavily in Travel Labs, and 
recently opened its 3rd Lab facility in Madrid which will see us hire up to 250 highly skilled digital professionals in 
Spain over the next 2 years. This follows on from the doubling in size of the team in Travel Labs Poland to almost 
200 IT professionals earlier this year.   Furthermore, Ryanair opened new bases in Frankfurt Main (opened in 
March) and Naples (April) which are performing well with strong advance bookings at low fares. The Frankfurt Main 
base will increase from 2 to 7 aircraft in Sept. Ryanair will launch 2 new bases in Memmingen (Munich) & Poznan in 
the autumn and open 170 new routes for winter ’17.     In May, Ryanair launched flight connections at Rome 
Fiumicino and in July extended it to Milan Bergamo. The airline has started selling Air Europa long-haul flights from 
Madrid on its website and has become the exclusive airline partner of the EU Erasmus Student Network. This 
partnership will enable Erasmus students to benefit from exclusive flight discounts to suit their budget and will be 
available from August.   Commenting on today's results, Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary said, "We remain 
concerned at the uncertainty which surrounds the terms of the UK’s departure from the EU in March ’19. While we 
continue to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU Open Skies agreement, we caution that should the UK leave, 
there may not be sufficient time, or goodwill on both sides, to negotiate a timely replacement bilateral which could 
result in a disruption of flights between the UK and Europe for a period of time from April ’19 onwards."
He added, "We, like all airlines, seek clarity on this issue before we publish our summer 2019 schedule in the 
second quarter of 2018. If we do not have certainty about the legal basis for the operation of flights between the UK 
Ryanair first quarter profits rise 55% to P397m
and the EU by autumn 2018, we may be forced to cancel flights and move some, or all, of our UK based aircraft to 
Continental Europe from April ’19 onwards.  We have contingency plans in place and will, as always, adapt to 
changed circumstances in the best interests of our customers and shareholders."

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. shares fell sharply on Monday as the pound advanced 
against the euro despite an IMF cut to its U.K. GDP growth forecast and Ryanair warned of increased competition 
in the months ahead.   There was also some disappointment on the data front as a key survey showed that the 
squeeze on U.K. household finances intensified in July.  The IHS Markit's household finance index dropped to 41.8 
in July from 43.7 in June, signaling the fastest deterioration in financial wellbeing for exactly three years. 
  The benchmark FTSE 100 was down 77 points or 1.04 percent at 7,375 in late opening deals after closing half a 
percent lower on Friday.   Ryanair lost 2.5 percent after the budget airline said it expects the pricing environment to 
remain very competitive in the second half of the year.   British Airways owner International Airlines Group fell as 
much as 5 percent and easyJet shed 2 percent.   Glencore dropped 1.3 percent after it signed a pact to invest up to 
66 million reais ($21 million) into Brazilian copper producer Paranapanema.  Randgold Resources shares fell over 1 
percent. The gold producer said  its Tongon gold mine in Cote d'Ivoire continues to ramp up production as it tracks 
its 2017 target of 285,000 ounces.  Reckitt Benckiser Group declined 1.5 percent after the consumer goods giant 
reduced its annual net revenue target to 2 percent from 3 percent.   On the positive side, B&M European Value 
Retail shares soared 4.2 percent. The Sunday Times reported that Asda, the U.K. supermarket arm of Wal-Mart 
Stores, is considering a 4.4 billion pounds ($5.7 billion) takeover of the British discount retailer.

       NEW DELHI (dpa-AFX) - Indian shares hit fresh record highs on Monday as continued buying by foreign funds 
and domestic institutional investors on the back of impressive quarterly results from the likes of Reliance Industries 
and HDFC Bank helped offset muted cues from global markets.   The benchmark BSE Sensex closed higher by 
216.98 points or 0.68 percent at 32,245.87, while the broader Nifty index finished up 51.15 points or 0.52 percent at 
9,966.40.  Intra-day trade saw both the indexes hitting fresh record highs of 32,320.86 and 9.982.05, respectively. 
 Reliance Industries rallied 2.2 percent to extend Friday's rally after posting strong quarterly results and announcing 
a 1:1 bonus issue.   Private sector lender HDFC Bank rose nearly 2 percent on reporting a 20 percent rise in Q1 net 
profit.   Bharti Airtel and TCS gained about 2 percent each. On the flip side, Divi's Labs tumbled 4.4 percent after 
disappointing Q1 numbers.  Other Asian markets ended on a mixed note, with a firmer yen, Friday's oil sell-off and 
U.S. political concerns weighing on markets.   Investors also awaited the outcome of U.S. Federal Reserve's 
monetary policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday for more clues on interest rate hikes this year.  European 
stock markets fell, with airline shares and automakers coming under selling pressure, after Ryanair warned of 
increased competition in the months ahead and EU antitrust regulators said they are investigating allegations of a 
cartel among a group of German carmakers.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - European stock markets fell on Monday, with airline shares and 
automakers coming under selling pressure, after Ryanair warned of increased competition in the months ahead and 
EU antitrust regulators said they are investigating allegations of a cartel among a group of German carmakers.  
Brexit worries, the recent strength of the euro and weak Eurozone economic data indicating slower growth also 
dented investor sentiment ahead of the Fed's latest policy meeting, due this week.   The Eurozone private sector 
started the third quarter on a solid footing but the pace of growth slowed for the second successive month in July, 
flash data from IHS Markit showed. 
The composite output index fell to a 6-month low of 55.8 in July from 56.3 in June.   The pound advanced against 
the euro despite an IMF cut to its U.K. GDP growth forecast and data showing that the squeeze on U.K. household 
finances intensified in July.  The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was down half a percent at 378.22 in late opening 
deals after falling over 1 percent to log its biggest single-day loss in three weeks on Friday.  The German DAX was 
losing 0.7 percent, France's CAC 40 index was moving down 0.3 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was declining 
0.9 percent.   Automakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen tumbled 3-4 percent after reports that EU regulators are 
studying reports of cartel among German carmakers.   Ryanair lost 2.5 percent in London after the budget airline 
said it expects the pricing environment to remain very competitive in the second half of the year.   British Airways 
owner International Airlines Group fell as much as 5 percent and easyJet shed 2 percent.   Gemalto plunged 16 
percent after the digital security company announced a goodwill impairment charge of around 420 million euros 
($489 million).  On the positive side, Philips Electronics shares rallied 3 percent in Amsterdam after the Dutch 
consumer electronics giant reported a rise in second-quarter net income from continuing operations on higher sales

Highlight: Friday's big sell-off in eurozone markets spreads to FTSE 100, with airline stocks worst hit after Ryanair 
sparks price war fears.
Body
The FTSE 100 has slumped into the red, dragged down by investor bearishness following the heavy sell-off that hit 
eurozone markets on Friday.
Eurozone markets fell heavily on Friday, sparked by a sustained rally in the euro as investors feared the impact of 
the European Central Bank trimming its bond-buying 'quantitative easing' programme.
That bearishness has now carried over into the FTSE 100, which fell 68 points, or 1%, to 7,375. 'Traders are still 
spooked by Friday's sell-off,' said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets UK.
'The major decline that we witnessed at the end of last week rattled dealers and that bearish sentiment hasn't gone 
away.'
Airlines stocks were among the biggest fallers after Ryanair (RYA.I) warned that fares could fall 8% in the second 
half of the year.
The airline announced a 55% jump in profits in the three months to the end of June, its first quarter, but warned 
fares could fall in the second half of its financial year.
'After a difficult winter last year, we expect the pricing environment to remain very competitive into the second half 
of the year,' it said. 'We see no reason at this time to alter our second half average fare guidance of an 8% decline.'
Shares in Ryanair fell 2.7% to &euro;17.61 and weighed on the airline's FTSE 100 rivals. British Airways owner 
International Airlines Group (ICAG) fell 2.5% to 575.5p and EasyJet (EZJ) was down 2.9% at &pound;12.73.
'The announcement from Ryanair that fares could be cut in order to fend off competition has put pressure on the 
entire airline sector,' said Madden.

BRITAIN'S major share index fell on Friday but had its strongest weekly gains in two months, sheltered from the 
battering European stocks experienced at the mercy of a strong euro, while mid-caps had their best week in nearly 
a year.
The FTSE 100 index was down 0.5 per cent at 7,452.91 points, substantially outperforming European bourses, 
having earlier hit its highest level since mid-June.
The relative weakness of the pound, close to an eight-month low against the euro, helped limit losses on the index 
whose exporting constituents tend to gain with a falling currency.
Among blue-chips betting firm Paddy Power Betfair closed down 2.14 per cent after a double downgrade from 
Investec. Healthcare was a rare bright spot, with Convatec and Shire up 1.7 to 1.9 per cent.
Vodafone shares pared gains to trade up 0.5 per cent after hitting a one-month high as it reported betterthan-
expected revenue growth for its first quarter.
This week there will be no mistaking we are back in the swing of results season. Today Reckitt Benckiser and 
Ryanair will release quarterly updates while food group Cranswick will put out a trading update. Domino's Pizza UK, 
Virgin Money and Fevertree Drinks are among the companies releasing quarterly results tomorrow. On Wednesday 
a smattering of the companies publishing quarterly figures include broadcaster ITV, oil group Tullow and GKN, 
while Fresnillo, Sage Group, Glaxo-SmithKline and Brewin Dolphin will release trading updates.
Thursday will be an absolutely bumper day for UK companies releasing quarterly earnings. Big hitters that day 
include Shell, Countrywide, Glencore, Thomas Cook, Astrazeneca, Lloyds, British American Tobacco and Anglo 
American.

EasyJet has lowered expectations of a fast turnround in the European airline industry after it warned the market 
would remain tough because of increased competition that was pushing down fares.
Europe's second-biggest low-cost carrier yesterday lifted its full-year profit forecast to a range of £380m to £420m, 
above the current analyst consensus of £375m, after reporting a strong third quarter.
But shares in easyJet fell almost 5 per cent after the airline said it expected revenue per seat - a measure of fares - 
to fall 2 per cent in the six months to September. It added that pressure on yields was also likely to extend into the 
next financial year.
The low-cost airline's comments come days after German flag carrier Lufthansa voiced similar concerns over the 
pricing outlook, despite also upgrading its profit forecast.
Carolyn McCall, who will leave easyJet at the end of the year to head broadcaster ITV, said there had been a lot of 
additional capacity in Spain and Portugal this summer. "We're not saying it is getting worse. The capacity 
environment is better but there is still growth and the reason for that growth in capacity is that fuel remains low," she 
said.
"We're simply saying pricing is not going to bounce back to plus-this or plus-that."
EasyJet raises profit hopes but warns on fares Airlines ; Low-cost carrier sounds cautionary note after strong 
third quarter
The cautionary outlook had a knock-on effect on easyJet's European rivals, with shares in Ryanair, IAG and 
Lufthansa also falling yesterday.
Analysts said it would damp expectations of a fast turnround in the European airline industry, which has been 
struggling with a glut of new capacity that is pushing down fares as well as the effect of the terror attacks in the EU 
and the UK's exit from the bloc.
Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Liberum, said there was a sense that expectations had "run away somewhat - and the 
share price moves you are seeing now is that expectation starting to unwind".
While easyJet remained cautious about the outlook, the low-cost airline beat city estimates in its third-quarter 
trading. The airline said total revenue per seat rose 2.2 per cent at constant currency, an improvement to its 
previous guidance for a low single-digit decline.
Passenger numbers increased 10.8 per cent to 22.3m in the three months to June 30, while revenues rose 16 per 
cent to £1.39bn. EasyJet's performance was helped by the late timing of Easter in April this year.
It comes after a tough period for the low-cost carrier, which in May unveiled its biggest interim loss in six years, 
while profits in 2016 were down 28 per cent.
"Although we expect capacity to continue to put pressure on yields, our progress this year has enabled us to 
upgrade this year's PBT [profit before tax] forecast and demonstrates that after a difficult 18 months of external 
challenges easyJet once again has positive momentum," said Dame Carolyn. EasyJet also confirmed it had been 
awarded its European air operating certificate in Austria, which it had announced last week. This will enable it to 
continue flying within Europe post-Brexit. Its first flight under its new operating licence took place yesterday.

Ashtead led the FTSE 100 higher yesterday after results from its closest peer bolstered hopes of improving industry 
pricing power.
United Rentals, the world's largest equipment rental provider, raised its full-year guidance after utilisation rates and 
rental revenue improved in the second quarter.
A tighter US hire market and sector consolidation should help Ashtead's Sunbelt business squeeze prices higher, 
analysts said.
"Ashtead has consistently outperformed United over the last three years," said Barclays. "However, United has at 
times been a big short-term sentiment driver of Ashtead's share price so, in that context, the comments on 
improving rate trends should be well received."
Shares in Ashtead closed 3.1 per cent higher at £17.10 as a broad-based rally lifted the FTSE 100, up 0.8 per cent, 
or 56.96 points, to 7,487.87.
WPP was 2.1 per cent higher at 15.92 after Unilever said it would reverse its first-half cut to advertising budgets.
The move reduced "structural concerns", said Liberum, which added that the weakness in ad spending of WPP's 
second-biggest client was "likely to have been a factor on the drag in WPP's first-half performance".
Ashtead rises along with hopes for US equipment hire London
EasyJet slipped 5.9 per cent to £13.34 after a caution on excess capacity overshadowed third-quarter results, which 
came with an upgrade to full-year guidance that had been baked into market expectations.
Its fellow low-cost airline Ryanair was down 3.5 per cent to (EURO)18.15.
Short covering helped Sports Direct jump 11.4 per cent to 335.1p after promising results from refurbished stores 
encouraged it to set 2018 guidance well above market expectations.
The retailer targeted 10 per cent growth in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the year 
to March rather than the 10 per cent decline expected by analysts.
Nearly 25 per cent of Sports Direct's free float is on loan to short sellers, the highest since 2008, Markit data show.
Sector peers edged higher after UK data showed retail sales accelerating in June, led by clothing and furniture.
Dixons Carphone rose 2.5 per cent to 270.2p, Next added 2.8 per cent to £37.83 and Kingfisher was up 2.4 per 
cent at 304.2p.
Elsewhere, Sophos took on 3.2 per cent to 469.3p. Morgan Stanley raised its target to 550p on the security 
software maker as part of a review of the software-as-a-service sector, where fast growth can obscure renewal 
margins given the high cost of customer acquisition.
The broker forecast that margins at Sophos would jump from 7 per cent this year to 27 per cent.

EasyJet has lowered expectations of a fast turnround in the European airline industry after it warned the market 
would remain tough because of increased competition that was pushing down fares.
Europe's second-biggest low-cost carrier yesterday lifted its full-year profit forecast to a range of £380m to £420m, 
above the current analyst consensus of £375m, after reporting a strong third quarter.
But shares in easyJet fell almost 5 per cent after the airline said it expected revenue per seat - a measure of fares - 
to fall by 2 per cent in the six months to September. It added that pressure on yields was also likely to extend into 
the next financial year.
The low-cost airline's comments come days after German flag carrier Lufthansa voiced similar concerns over the 
pricing outlook, despite also upgrading its profit forecast.
Carolyn McCall, who will leave easyJet at the end of the year to head up UK broadcaster ITV, said there had been 
a lot of additional capacity in Spain and Portugal this summer.
"We're not saying it is getting worse. The capacity environment is better but there is still growth and the reason for 
that growth in capacity is that fuel remains low. We're simply saying pricing is not going to bounce back to plusthis 
or plus-that," she said.

The cautionary outlook had a knock-on effect on easyJet's European rivals, with shares in Ryanair, IAG and

Analysts said it would damp expectations of a fast turnround in the European airline industry, which has been 
struggling with a glut of new capacity that is pushing down fares as well as the effect of the terror attacks in the EU

Highlight: Should investors discard their boarding cards? Two fund managers make the case for investing in air 
travel.
Body
Will the idea of socially responsible investment and air travel ever get off the ground? From some perspectives it 
seems unlikely and there are plenty of damning statistics highlighting the reasons why. Dr. Volker Grewe of the 
DLR – Institute of Atmospheric Physics, for example, said in a recent paper that aviation accounts for 5% of man-
made climate change.
While emissions from the airline industry might seem low at 2% of the total, compared with about 14% from 
agriculture and 26% from energy generation, airplane emissions are expected to rise by about 2-3% a year.
So is there any possible justification for a socially responsible investor to add airline exposure to their portfolio? 
Mikhail Zverev, head of global equity at Standard Life Investments, says there are some important distinctions to 
make between different airlines in this respect.
Here he highlights Ryanair, a 2.5% allocation in his SLI Glo SICAV Global Equities  fund, which is striving to 
improve fuel efficiency where possible.
‘Ryanair's fleet is one of the most modern, it has the most fuel-efficient planes in its class and it consistently pushes 
that forward in terms of ordering new stock. Its management approach ensures that its fleet is new,' he says.
‘The firm typically doesn't hold planes past seven years, which is when you need to have a proper refurbishment 
and a big service. It always refreshes its fleets to have the latest kit.'
The manager adds that Ryanair's overall costs are the lowest in the industry. The company does not pay investors 
a regular dividend and its competitive costs are helping it to grow capacity by 10% each year.
‘It has an environmental policy and it would say the environmental footprint is part of that agenda, but I think a big 
chunk of that is about how you get the lowest cost per mile,' he says.
Going the extra mile
SRI-conscious airlines cleared for take-off
Even if the number of flights is set to increase, Alexei Jourovski is among those who are welcoming dedicated 
efforts by carriers to mitigate their environmental impact. The Citywire A-rated manager, who runs the UNI-Global 
Equities Europe fund, says charging models are an example of this trend.
‘Some airlines levy an additional charge that the customer can opt into. The airline then invests this money in an 
environmentally friendly way to offset the carbon emission,' Jourovski says.
‘However, this is not common practice. Most airlines compete for efficiency by switching to cleaner aircraft like 
EasyJet. It tries to advertise the fact it has a cleaner fleet to give the customer a feel-good factor.'
Elsewhere, airlines like Qantas and Virgin have offered passengers the chance to add carbon credits to their 
airfare, which are then donated to schemes around the world that aim to reduce greenhouse gasses. However, only 
1% of travellers with Virgin chose to offset their emissions in 2014-2015.
Changing track
So how do other forms of travel stack up? We covered the SRI investment case for driverless cars in our February 
issue, but what about trains? In Europe, rail travel is touted as a green alternative as they typically emit less carbon 
than airplanes. However, Zverev (pictured) believes the investment case for this sector is difficult to compare.
‘Passenger rail travel doesn't have a great history of value creation. Much of the system in Europe was developed 
to have a big component of public sector subsidy and public ownership, so you can't really compare the two 
investment cases that easily.
‘European rail travel is good. Euro-railing is a compelling option, trains in Benelux and Germany and France are 
fast, comfortable and convenient options and yet the short-haul, low-cost airlines are still a growth sector so clearly 
there is a competitive offering there,' he says.
High hopes
Nevertheless, while technology has made advances in cutting harmful emissions in the airline industry, Jourovski 
believes that the inner workings of planes are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.
‘Due to the nature of the internal combustion engine and the turbo propeller aircraft it is difficult to see a big change 
in the next 20 years. Longer term, I believe the picture depends on the general availability of oil and any 
technological advancement such as electrical flight. In our view there is still a long way to go,' he says.
Meanwhile, Zverev doesn't see serious competition from other forms of travel and believes it will be difficult to 
change the behaviour of consumers who are now so used to the convenience of flying.
‘Global passenger numbers are growing, people love to travel. It might be clichéd, but consumer aspirations are 
increasingly more about intangible experiences rather than material possessions.
Travel is a big part of that. Whole new markets, especially in emerging powerhouses like China, are discovering air 
travel.'
So perhaps that is the important point to grasp. Air travel is here to stay and set to grow and for this reason some 
SRI involvement may be better than simply turning your back and having no influence at all.

Highlight: Should investors discard their boarding cards? Two fund managers make the case for investing in air 
travel.
Body
Will the idea of socially responsible investment and air travel ever get off the ground? From some perspectives it 
seems unlikely and there are plenty of damning statistics highlighting the reasons why. Dr. Volker Grewe of the 
DLR – Institute of Atmospheric Physics, for example, said in a recent paper that aviation accounts for 5% of man-
made climate change.
While emissions from the airline industry might seem low at 2% of the total, compared with about 14% from 
agriculture and 26% from energy generation, airplane emissions are expected to rise by about 2-3% a year.
So is there any possible justification for a socially responsible investor to add airline exposure to their portfolio? 
Mikhail Zverev, head of global equity at Standard Life Investments, says there are some important distinctions to 
make between different airlines in this respect.
Here he highlights Ryanair, a 2.5% allocation in his SLI Glo SICAV Global Equities  fund, which is striving to 
improve fuel efficiency where possible.
‘Ryanair's fleet is one of the most modern, it has the most fuel-efficient planes in its class and it consistently pushes 
that forward in terms of ordering new stock. Its management approach ensures that its fleet is new,' he says.
‘The firm typically doesn't hold planes past seven years, which is when you need to have a proper refurbishment 
and a big service. It always refreshes its fleets to have the latest kit.'
The manager adds that Ryanair's overall costs are the lowest in the industry. The company does not pay investors 
a regular dividend and its competitive costs are helping it to grow capacity by 10% each year.
‘It has an environmental policy and it would say the environmental footprint is part of that agenda, but I think a big 
chunk of that is about how you get the lowest cost per mile,' he says.
Going the extra mile
SRI-conscious airlines cleared for take-off
Even if the number of flights is set to increase, Alexei Jourovski is among those who are welcoming dedicated 
efforts by carriers to mitigate their environmental impact. The Citywire A-rated manager, who runs the UNI-Global

'Rip-off ' card charges to be made illegal; Clampdown on 'unfair' fees hits 
shares in airlines and takeaway food apps

Shares in British companies that charge customers high fees to pay by debit and credit card fell after the 
government said that such charges would be made illegal from next year.
The government said it was clamping down on "rip-off card charges" which were "unfair for millions of people 
across the country", with UK consumers estimated to have spent more than £470m on fees in 2010.
The government said the fees, as high as 20 per cent of a total bill, would be banned from January.
Shares in Just Eat, the takeaway app, dropped more than 6 per cent initially - its worst day since January - although 
they recovered to trade about 1 per cent lower by the end of the day.
Just Eat charges 50p per credit card transaction, as does rival Hungryhouse, which is subject to a takeover 
approach by Just Eat. About 13 per cent of Just Eat's revenues came from card fees last year, with two-thirds of its 
orders paid for by card.
UK-listed airlines also fell on the news before recovering later in the day, with the government specifically 
mentioning the sector when introducing the ban. British Airways and easyJet charge 1 per cent extra for credit card 
transactions, while Ryanair and Norwegian airlines charge 2 per cent.
'Rip-off ' card charges to be made illegal Clampdown on 'unfair' fees hits shares in airlines and takeaway food 
apps
Stephen Barclay, the economic secretary to the Treasury, said that the move was "about fairness and 
transparency".
"Rip-off charges have no place in a modern Britain and that's why card charging in Britain is about to come to an 
end," the minister said.
The rules also tackle surcharging by local councils and government agencies, such as the Driver and Vehicle 
Licensing Agency.
The DVLA charges a flat fee of £2.50 for card payments - a policy it will be forced to amend. Other retailers are also 
affected.
But some experts said that banning surcharges would simply lead businesses to push up their prices. Larger 
businesses such as global airlines may absorb the costs to remain competitive, but smaller companies could come 
under greater pressure.
Analysts said that the exposure for airlines was more limited given that any charges would be at a much lower 
percentage of earnings than takeaway apps.
Analysts at Barclays said the rules were simply the implementation of an EU directive, and that the share price 
move for companies like Just Eat was unwarranted.
Barclays said that Just Eat's business model was not directly affected by this legislation, and added that the 
affected companies would likely "raise prices to cover this" or will add "generic administration fees" to transactions.

Carsten Spohr can afford an extra smile or two these days as he looks back on a challenging first three years as 
chief executive of Lufthansa Group.
February and March brought breakthroughs in protracted negotiations with unions over pay, pensions and other 
conditions, as Lufthansa pilots tentatively agreed to a new contract, following earlier deals with ground staff and 
cabin crew.
Labour disputes had cast a shadow over Spohr’s first three years as Lufthansa Group chief executive, a challenge 
he inherited after previous agreements expired in 2012. In its full-year 2016 results, Lufthansa stated that industrial 
action by pilots in November alone hit earnings by 100 million ($114 million). The pressure to resolve the conflict 
was huge.

"I would be lying if I didn't admit it was stressful," Spohr told FlightGlobal on the final day of the recent IATA annual 
general meeting in Cancun. "There probably wasn't a single day where I didn't think about the labour conflicts going 
on because I fly every day, so I meet crew every day, on the ground, in the cockpit, in the cabin.
"And of course there wasn't a single day where I wasn’t somehow – sometimes verbally, sometimes by looks – 
basically confronted by the situation."
Bringing that uncertainty to an end leaves Spohr freer to concentrate on meeting the other challenges faced by the 
group, with the premium offerings of its mainline operations – Lufthansa itself, Austrian Airlines and Swiss – and the 
low-cost offering from Eurowings and its subsidiaries central to its plans.
INTERVIEW: Carsten Spohr, chief executive, Lufthansa Group Carsten Spohr can afford an extra smile or two 
these days as he looks back on a challenging first thr....
"I think we are now harvesting the fruits of the hard work of the first three years I have been in this job," he says. 
"And that makes us feel good and positive about the years to come."
When Spohr replaced Christoph Franz as Lufthansa Group chief executive in 2014, he took on a business already 
in the midst of a cost-saving effort in response to the competitive threat from Gulf airlines and Turkish Airlines in 
particular. The group's airline operations were perceived to be at a disadvantage compared with rival major 
European carriers because of Germany's federal nature and therefore dispersed population: its Frankfurt and 
Munich bases traditionally rely on people travelling from other large German cities such as Berlin, Dusseldorf and 
Hamburg.
In short, the door was open for the Gulf carriers and Turkish to take a significant portion of passengers in those 
latter cities, offering links to Asia and beyond without the hassle of connecting to a Lufthansa base. At the same 
time, Lufthansa Group had no Gulf carrier partnerships, unlike its main European rivals.
The threat from low-cost carriers was also growing, with EasyJet and Ryanair encroaching on Lufthansa territory, 
among other developments.
SCORE MISSES
Piling more pressure on Spohr, the group's cost-saving effort, named Score, was about to fall short of its target, 
while analysts were questioning the group's reliance on bigger, four-engined aircraft amid wobbly yields and an 
industry trend towards fuel-efficient twinjets. Spohr was under no illusions about the size of the task ahead as he 
continued to reshape the group's cost structure. Resolving the labour dispute was central to that.
"In Lufthansa’s case it was obvious. We had [labour] agreements from the days when we were state-owned and we 
had to go through that," says Spohr.
That pressure to resolve labour disputes quickly tested Spohr's mettle. The pressure increased even further in 
March 2015 when a Germanwings flight crashed in the French Alps, killing everyone on board. By most accounts, 
his handling of that incident and a strike-ridden three years has been impressive, marked by a cool head and 
affable manner.
"Part of the CEO job is not to let others see how much stress you are under, or at least try to not let others see how 
much stress you are under," Spohr says. "My line I always used to stabilise myself was: rather a few days without 
Lufthansa than one day without Lufthansa [existing] at all. And that put things back into perspective. But it was 
difficult.
"We have to remember we've put our stakeholders through a lot in the past three years – shareholders, customers 
and staff. Labour conflicts, share price – which dropped after the bubble of promising the market too much kind of 
broke. Obviously our customers had to go through these labour conflicts – and had 29 days of strikes."
BillyPix
Despite a slight drop in its full-year 2016 results, the group's recent financial performance has been positive and 
Spohr is able to look to the future much more confidently than he could a few months ago.
While not quite a lifer, Spohr has been with Lufthansa in various roles for the vast majority of his career. He initially 
trained as a commercial pilot with Lufthansa Flight Training before a brief interlude to complete a management 
training course with Deutsche Aerospace. Spohr then returned to Lufthansa Group in October 1994, eventually 
becoming Lufthansa Cargo chief in 2007, then head of Lufthansa mainline in 2011. He took on his current role as 
group chief in May 2014.
That left him in charge of what is, in terms of number of staff, one of the largest airline groups in the world; a 
substantial challenge that means he has oversight of five large business segments: passengers airlines, MRO, 
catering, logistics and other activities.
INTERVIEW: Carsten Spohr, chief executive, Lufthansa Group Carsten Spohr can afford an extra smile or two

"Any group the size of Lufthansa – 130,000 people – you need to find decentralised management structures to 
keep control of the business," he says. "Not only cost control – quality control, control about motivation of staff, 
control about ethics and compliance, I could go on.
"There is no way the small board could control such a huge company the size of my home town without 
decentralised controls," he adds. "So years ago we established a structure by spinning off Lufthansa Technik, 
Lufthansa Cargo, IT, catering, flight training – so we created a decentralised management structure where basically 
cost control is done locally and divisionally."
But does this decentralised structure make it harder to judge how the business is performing?
"Part of my thinking is we should focus a bit more on the overall group result than just individual results," Spohr 
says. "We went a bit too far in decentralising the success or non-success element. In the end it is one group."
Spohr is firm that airline operations are the core of Lufthansa's world. Indeed, he suggests that when he took his 
current role, he "brought some clarity back" on that issue.
"As someone who ran Cargo for four years and Lufthansa airline for almost four years, the core of Lufthansa is the 
airline," he says. "We are not a financial holding. We are not a conglomerate. In the end we are an aviation group 
centred around the airline business. and that again is centred around the Lufthansa brand.
"People thinking about Lufthansa think about our airline first. And they should."
The structure of Lufthansa’s airline business is a key area where Spohr has instigated major changes in the face of 
tougher competition. Germanwings, the low-cost unit covered by the same pilot contracts as Lufthansa mainline, 
has been phased out, having once been the centre of its budget expansion plans. Eurowings, and its separate 
labour agreements, is now the focus for that growth, leaving Lufthansa mainline to concentrate on premium 
markets.
"By establishing Eurowings as part of our dual-brand strategy, we could focus more clearly on Lufthansa being 
premium," he says. "Investing into products on the ground, investing into our crews, investing into IT – especially on 
the distribution side.
"Part of the recent commercial success we've seen in Lufthansa mainline comes from the fact that we are so much 
more focused now on premium because of Eurowings covering other markets, other products, other customers."
BillyPix
Spohr is positive about recent yield developments, particularly in those premium markets, where there has been a 
focus on transatlantic growth.
"The yield to really look at is the yield after fuel effects," he argues. "I don't think we do that enough in this industry. 
So my positive outlook for this year is not only based on our cost development; it is also even more based on our 
yield development.
"You also need to be aware that with our premium positioning, having 100 first- and business-class seats [on an 
Airbus A380 or Boeing 747-8], Lufthansa is especially focusing on the upper end of the market where we have seen 
positive developments."
Crucially, Spohr says his optimism about the mainline operations has been boosted further by the recent labour 
agreement, which will allow it to take on trainee pilots for the first time since the previous agreement ended in 2012.
Under the dual-brand strategy, the Eurowings brand now leads its low-cost efforts, with secondary airports a key 
consideration.
INTERVIEW: Carsten Spohr, chief executive, Lufthansa Group Carsten Spohr can afford an extra smile or two 
these days as he looks back on a challenging first thr....
"We don't want to withdraw to hubs only. So we wanted – and needed – a business model for those secondary 
German, Austrian and Swiss markets that are in themselves very powerful business centres," he says. "We all 
know, especially in the geography of Germany, there are other potential economic centres apart from Frankfurt and 
Munich that we don't want to give up."
The second function of Eurowings is an attempt to head off the competition from low-cost carriers, and hoover up 
underserved leisure markets, particularly as Air Berlin undergoes a fundamental transformation into something 
much smaller.
"We know that there is – especially on the leisure side – a customer group which is just basically choosing their 
products by price. That also applies to long-range," notes Spohr.
Eurowings was established ahead of long-haul low-cost efforts from European rival groups Air France-KLM and 
IAG. "It feels good that my other two big European competitors have followed suit," Spohr says, acknowledging that 
the group had been "somewhat slow maybe" to respond to short-haul low-cost challenges.
Lufthansa's strategy sees Eurowings operations from the group's main hubs, raising the question of cannibalisation. 
The low-cost unit is expanding at Austrian's Vienna home, for example.
"We do operate Eurowings out of our hubs," Spohr says. "Usually we try to focus on more point-to-point demand. 
Go off the banks in terms of timing. Go for efficiency of the aircraft rather than just hitting the perfect bank structure 
as you do in a hub. And we have a much more leisure-orientated destination portfolio."
Spohr sees this development of its dual-brand strategy as a positive thing: "In the end, all these markets overlap. 
You cannot cut one market from the other."
Eurowings is also central to Lufthansa's response to low-cost carrier incursions on its territory. Swiss, for example, 
faces a big EasyJet presence at its Geneva base, while both the UK carrier and Ryanair have significant German 
presences; notably, Ryanair now operates from Frankfurt Main. Spohr says Lufthansa is well-placed to handle this 
competition.
"We believe that with Eurowings we have a response if needed. And I think Lufthansa in all its strength has also 
learned in the last few years to take any competitor seriously.
"Nobody has yet endangered Lufthansa, but surely many have challenged us. So if there's a new competitor as we 
now have in Frankfurt we learned that they can be successful and we can be successful. So I think to be honest in 
Europe right now it's not the successful carriers hurting each other, I think it’s more the ones who are less 
successful who are getting squeezed."
BRUSSELS STRATEGY
Despite this confidence, the highly telegraphed absorption of Brussels Airlines has led some analysts to question 
how the Belgian carrier's business model sits under the Eurowings brand. For Spohr, the answer is obvious, even if 
he acknowledges a business-model gap does exist between the two.
"Both Eurowings and Brussels are hybrid models," he says. "They are not pure point-to-point models because in 
the geography of our home markets – Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium – there is no such city that you don't 
need connecting traffic for long-range. You can do it in Paris, do it in London, do it in Tokyo or New York – but in my 
home market, there is no city big enough.
"On the other side, they are both not big enough to create a full-fledged hub as we have in Zurich or Munich. 
Therefore, this hybrid model might be another 10% apart – that's a job we are now doing in the initial phase of 
creating more synergies."
INTERVIEW: Carsten Spohr, chief executive, Lufthansa Group Carsten Spohr can afford an extra smile or two 
these days as he looks back on a challenging first thr....
The incorporation of Brussels Airlines raises the trend of consolidation between European airlines. Lufthansa Group 
has been at the centre of much speculation in this area recently, and Spohr acknowledges that there is plenty of 
room for further development.
"I think in Europe we're not striving for the consolidation level in US numbers where by now the top five carriers 
have 90% of the market," he says. "But the fact that the top five carriers in Europe only have 43% of the market is 
definitely too low."
Two carriers often linked to Lufthansa in recent months are two businesses that might lack appeal, financially at 
least: Air Berlin and Alitalia.
On its fellow German operator, Spohr acknowledges an interest beyond a current arrangement under which 
Lufthansa Group is wet-leasing 38 aircraft from the beleaguered carrier. "Of course, there is therefore an interest to 
potentially go further," he says. "But there are three hurdles to be overcome. Any of these could stop it," he adds, 
citing Air Berlin's cost structure, its debt and unavoidable anti-trust concerns.
When asked if Lufthansa is interested in acquiring Alitalia, he is more blunt: "The Italian market, indeed. Alitalia as it 
stands now, no."
WIDER PARTNERSHIP
Air Berlin and Alitalia are also notable as having received significant investments from Etihad Aviation Group in 
recent years. Earlier this year, Lufthansa announced a partnership with Etihad, mainly covering catering and MRO. 
But will the partnership survive the departure of the Abu Dhabi group's chief executive James Hogan?
"The partnership we established goes beyond individuals because it creates a win-win," says Spohr. "And you 
might recall that even in the highest public attention on the competition between the Gulf carriers and European 
carriers, I always said I am open to partnerships as long as they do offer win-win."
Lufthansa Group's range of services means that Spohr – a sometime high-profile critic of perceived Gulf carrier 
subsidies – has to look beyond competition with the region's big three.
"All Gulf carriers are important customers of our Lufthansa Group – be it MRO, catering, IT, flight training. 
Specifically on Etihad, we have found synergies in taking part of the capacity of Air Berlin, which then helped Etihad 
as an important shareholder. We were able to create codeshares on routes which one of us has not been operating 
and we have some interesting agreements to sign on catering and MRO.
"Is there room for more? If there is a win-win out there, why not?"
The Etihad partnership raises questions around Lufthansa’s existing relationship with Singapore Airlines, for 
example. SIA might reasonably be concerned about any deepening of Lufthansa's Etihad partnership and the 
impact it could have on the German group's Asia strategy.
"They need to be complementary. Otherwise we wouldn't do it, because there is a clear hierarchy: our own metal 
and joint ventures first, other partnerships second," Spohr clarifies. "So we wouldn't endanger our own metal or a 
joint venture with a codeshare partnership with anybody."
Spohr notes that Lufthansa now receives 75% of its intercontinental revenue through its joint ventures with Air 
Canada, Air China, All Nippon Airways, SIA and United Airlines. He describes this level as "unique among the 
industry", reflecting the "overproportional" importance of joint ventures to Lufthansa Group.
It operates those services using a fleet of around 160 widebodies. More central to its fleet strategy is the impact of 
on-order twin-engined widebodies such as the A350 and 777-9 and the fundamental impact they have on traditional 
assumptions about the group's hubs. Flight Fleets Analyzer reflects Lufthansa mainline's current focus on large,

four-engined aircraft, showing it has 31 A340s, 14 A380s and 32 747s in service, within a widebody fleet that also 
features three A350s and 19 A330s.
"Historically, Frankfurt always had an advantage because it had extra-large aircraft with the lowest unit costs, and 
our three smaller hubs – Zurich, Vienna and Munich – were somewhat disadvantaged by having smaller widebody 
aircraft with high unit costs," Spohr says. "That advantage of Frankfurt will disappear now gradually – and the 
disadvantage of the smaller hubs will disappear – so that will allow us to play the multi-hub model at a much higher 
level of perfection in the next few years."
Consequently, Spohr sees "no need for additional A380s", even though "passengers love it – all 14,000 who fly it 
every day with us".
Despite a perception in the industry that Lufthansa's fleet make-up has been somewhat conservative, Spohr has 
also shown himself to be fully aware of the myriad disruptive factors circling the industry; indeed, he has turned 
Lufthansa Group into a disruptor on global distribution system fees, controversially introducing a charge for flights 
booked outside its group websites in 2015.
"It was a brave move, we were aware of that, but even as a legacy carrier with the strong history of Lufthansa, 
sometimes you need to be disruptive. And I think we've chosen the right topic to be disruptive. Even though maybe 
others talk more about being disruptive than we do, we just did it."
As Spohr continues to plot Lufthansa Group's future shape, global geopolitical uncertainties and security worries 
show no signs of abating. Some of its biggest rivals have been at the centre of some significant developments 
recently: the Gulf region has been mired in a dispute over Qatar's alleged support for extremists amid uncertain 
traffic growth, while Turkish has been hit by terrorist incidents and the fallout from the country's attempted coup. 
While Germany and the surrounding region has not been immune from troublesome incidents, Spohr is still keen to 
highlight one of Lufthansa Group's biggest advantages: its home markets.
"I have to be honest, having a home market which is called Germany and Switzerland is probably not the worst 
thing in the world right now," he concludes.

Carolyn McCall landed at easyJet from the media industry and proved that an industry outsider can run an airline 
successfully.
As the chief executive prepares to depart for ITV, many within the industry expect the UK carrier once again to 
focus its search externally - outside the company and the airline sector - as it looks for her successor. But with 
strategic challenges mounting, Europe's second biggest low-cost airline might feel more pressure to opt for 
someone with greater aviation experience.
EasyJet said on Monday that it had launched the search for Dame Carolyn's replacement and expected to select 
from a "strong range of candidates".
It is likely to cast its net wide. The airline will be hunting someone who can continue the strong recent financial 
performance - albeit which suffered a blip last year - as well as deal with new challenges such as Brexit and 
increased competition.

Potential internal candidates include Chris Browne, easyJet's chief operating officer, who has worked at Tui Travel 
and Spanish airline Iberia; Andrew Findlay, chief financial officer, and Peter Duffy, who heads up the carrier's 
marketing department.
But Jonathan Wober, an analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation, says an external candidate would be a good move, 
adding that there are still "too many airline people running airlines."
"It's obviously a very technical industry, so you clearly need airline people, but airline managers are often a bit too 
much in love with the toys. [You need] someone who can come in a bit more objectively and say it makes sense to 
dedicate resource and invest or not," he says.
Dame Carolyn, who was chief executive of Guardian Media Group before, has been credited with transforming 
easyJet, which, when she joined in 2010, was suffering from a bungled crewing strategy and punctuality problems.
Under her leadership operating margins have risen from 7 per cent to a peak of 14.7 per cent in 2015. This fell to 
10.9 per cent in 2016 after a difficult year for the airline industry, during which Brexit, terrorist attacks and a capacity 
glut hit demand.
"What they need is someone who is going to take a fresh approach on costs," says Gerald Khoo, analyst at 
Liberum. "One of the big challenges that easyJet faces is getting costs coming down again. Non-fuel unit costs are 
not out of control but they are not falling despite their recent efforts."
The broader challenge for the group's next chief will be navigating a competitive squeeze from two directions: 
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, has a lower cost base and is moving upmarket by opening up bases in 
more primary airports and introducing allocated seating. EasyJet is also facing competition from legacy carriers that 
are attempting to copy its business model.
"EasyJet still has a cost advantage over legacy carriers but it's that squeeze - at the moment it's not apparent that it 
is hurting them but in the longer run, unless Ryanair dramatically loses its focus or does something crazy, that's the 
issue they have to resolve," says Mr Wober.
Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst at Barclays, agrees that easyJet and Ryanair are likely to "bump up against 
each other more often than they once did". However he believes there is still potential for both low-cost airlines to 
gain market share from other carriers. It is these strategic challenges that could require easyJet to opt for someone 
with aviation experience this time. "The market has become more challenging over the past year, that's why I think 
it would be important to have an industry player. Operational acumen is going to be key," says John Strickland, a 
Londonbased aviation analyst. "They will also need someone who can handle the regulatory and competitive 
challenges of Brexit."
EasyJet has already gone some way to deal with the looming issue of Britain's departure from the EU. The low-cost 
airline last week announced that it will soon receive an air operating licence in Austria, which will help it secure the 
rights to fly within the EU. However, there is still concern from many within the industry over what post-Brexit deal 
there will be to enable airlines to fly to and from the UK.
A more immediate issue for both Dame Carolyn and the next chief executive will be improving on-time performance 
again, which has been hit recently by problems at Gatwick and air traffic control strikes.
"The on time performance statistics improved steadily under Carolyn but in the past year or two they've started 
declining again," says Mr Wober. "That's probably an issue in terms of the operational side that anyone coming in 
will need to reverse the slide on. You don't want to go back to where it was before she arrived otherwise at some 
point customers start to get annoyed again."

Carolyn McCall landed at easyJet from the media industry and proved that an industry outsider can run an airline 
successfully.
As the chief executive prepares to depart for ITV, many within the industry expect the UK carrier once again to 
focus its search externally - outside the company and the airline sector - as it looks for her successor. But with 
strategic challenges mounting, Europe's second biggest low-cost airline might feel more pressure to opt for 
someone with greater aviation experience.
EasyJet said on Monday that it had launched the search for Dame Carolyn's replacement and expected to select 
from a "strong range of candidates".
It is likely to cast its net wide. The airline will be hunting someone who can continue the strong recent financial 
performance - albeit which suffered a blip last year - as well as deal with new challenges such as Brexit and 
increased competition.

EasyJet and Ryanair have both expressed interest in the Alitalia sale process – which could either mean that they 
are keen to have opportunistic peek at their ailing rival's books, or that they are genuinely considering bids for the 
Italian flag carrier.
Neither budget airline has yet given a clear indication of its intentions.
While she confirmed that EasyJet was "interested" in Alitalia, the UK low-cost carrier's chief executive Carolyn 
McCall told reporters in June: "We are not allowed to comment on the process at all. We have been asked by the 
government to not make any comment whatsoever about what is happening with Alitalia."
In confirming Ryanair's expression of interest, chief executive Michael O'Leary stressed that his airline was "a long 
way short of bidding" and, indeed, that "there would need to be a lot of changes to Alitalia before I think anyone 
would be interested in bidding for it".
But how might Ryanair benefit from a takeover, if one did transpire?
RYANAIR'S ITALIAN INCURSIONS
Data from Italian civil aviation authority ENAC shows that Ryanair is already the country's largest by passengers 
carried. The airline carried 32.6 million people in 2016, compared with Alitalia's 23.1 million. And the trend has been 
one of Ryanair advancing steadily in the short-haul market at the expense of its Italian rival.
FlightGlobal schedules data indicates that the budget carrier has a 22% share of all seats in Italy – factoring in both 
domestic and international routes.

With its entry to the Naples market this year, Ryanair now has bases in all of Italy's principal cities. In both Rome 
and Milan, it has operations at more than one airport.
Buying all or part of Alitalia could be a means of picking up valuable slots at the capital's Fiumicino hub and at Milan 
Linate, the northern city's business-friendly airport.
Alitalia's fleet would also be up for grabs; however, it is difficult to imagine this would be very attractive to Ryanair. 
Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that Alitalia has a fleet of 101 aircraft in service, the majority of them Airbus 
narrowbodies; Ryanair has an all-Boeing fleet.
Then there are Alitalia's widebodies – 14 A330s and 11 Boeing 777s – and the question of its long-haul business as 
a whole.
The received wisdom is that while Alitalia's short-haul network is haemorrhaging money, its long-haul operation is 
more lucrative and might be salvageable.
O'Leary has long talked about his interest in entering the long-haul business, but always says this would be 
undertaken by a separate company without Ryanair branding. Could a reformed, streamlined Alitalia long-haul unit 
fit the bill? Given the airline's narrow national focus, it seems unlikely.
Against the small number of potential pluses, there is a much longer list of negatives attached to buying the national 
carrier.
Restructuring of Alitalia would require major effort and funds. The airline is saddled with debt, is highly unionised, 
and has been slower to embrace the need for a low-cost unit than its European network rivals such as Air France-
KLM and IAG.
It's a big task to take on as Etihad, and previous Alitalia strategic investor Air France-KLM, have both discovered. 
And as far as acquisitions are concerned, Ryanair has shown little appetite for such moves and, instead, generally 
positions itself to pounce on any airline failures.
Its purchase of UK low-cost unit Buzz in 2003 represents its only successful acquisition to date. That deal was 
strategic in nature, designed to give Ryanair greater market share at London Stansted and to boost its fleet.
O'Leary then trained his sights on a bigger prize: Aer Lingus. After purchasing a 16% stake in the Irish flag carrier in 
2006 and upping that to 25% later the same year, Ryanair launched the first of several unsuccessful takeover bids. 
The first was rejected by Aer Lingus shareholders, and multiple future bids collapsed in the face of union and 
shareholder opposition as well as regulatory hurdles. Ryanair admitted defeat in 2015 and sold its shares to IAG, 
which helped clear the way for that airline group to acquire Aer Lingus.
Ryanair briefly circled Cyprus Airways in 2014, making a formal offer. O'Leary said his airline was on a shortlist of 
just two, along with Aegean Airlines, but ultimately Cyprus Airways collapsed in January 2015 before any details 
were shared on what Ryanair's offer for the struggling operator involved.
It would be easy for Ryanair to sit back and continue its current strategy of eating into Alitalia's market share. The 
indications are, however, that O'Leary wants to accelerate growth of his airline's presence in Italy, with or without a 
partnership.
O'Leary is among a growing cohort of airline chief executives who believe that as low-cost carriers continue to grow 
their market share in Europe they will inevitably need to interline with long-haul carriers.
Ryanair is already in advanced talks with Norwegian and Aer Lingus to seal a feeding agreement for long-haul 
flights, and O'Leary has suggested that other airlines have approached him to do a similar deal. That, Italian media 
reported in December 2016, included Alitalia. While no deal with Alitalia emerged, O'Leary remains focused on the 
potential of feeder services in Italy.

In May, Ryanair picked Fiumicino for its first experiment in connecting passengers by offering onward routes from 
the Italian gateway. This month it expanded the trial to Bergamo, one of its major bases.
It is possible that O'Leary is hoping that in its current perilous state, Alitalia can be convinced to agree a feeding 
arrangement with Ryanair, and that acquisition talks could facilitate this. Alternatively, he may be positioning 
Ryanair to take advantage of a full collapse of Alitalia, which would open up opportunities in Rome and elsewhere.
But another reason could be the one O'Leary has publicly highlighted: that the connecting trial is taking place in 
Italy because Ryanair wants to test it out before enacting an interline partnership with Norwegian, potentially at 
Fiumicino – where both carriers have bases, and from which the Scandinavian carrier plans to operate long-haul 
flights from November.
Whatever the case, it seems likely Ryanair would benefit more from a partnership with Alitalia than buying it 
outright.
EASYJET'S TOP-SPOT CHANCE
If the business case for a Ryanair takeover of Alitalia seems unconvincing, the same is probably true for EasyJet.
More access to Linate would be in line with EasyJet's strategy of operating to primary airports – and could give it 
space to grow beyond its Malpensa base.
EasyJet did have a base at Fiumicino but closed it in 2016, in the face of competition from budget rivals. Alitalia's 
slots might tempt the UK carrier – which still serves Fiumicino – to reopen a base at the capital city airport, but the 
competition now is if anything more intense, with Norwegian having opened a Roman station last year.
While EasyJet's Italian passenger numbers fell fractionally to 14.3 million in 2016, ENAC figures show, the carrier is 
still the country's third largest. Apart from Milan Malpensa, it has a large presence at airports such as Venice Marco 
Polo and Naples. And an acquisition of Alitalia would make EasyJet the largest carrier in Italy.
Alitalia's fleet of 72 A320-family aircraft might appeal to the UK carrier. Among the 72 jets are 12 A321s, which 
could be useful as EasyJet seeks to upgauge on constrained routes. However, Flight Fleets Analyzer shows the 
Alitalia fleet as a whole having an average age of more than 11 years, which might be too uneconomical for 
EasyJet. The UK carrier has large orders for the Neo.
The Italian carrier's widebody fleet would also appear to be unattractive for EasyJet given that, unlike Ryanair, 
McCall has completely ruled out any interest in going into long-haul markets. That stance, theoretically, could be 
revisited by McCall's successor – EasyJet having on 17 July confirmed that McCall is leaving to head UK 
broadcaster ITV. McCall, though, will remain in post until the end of the year, and given the urgency of Alitalia's 
search for investors, any decision will likely still be made on her watch.
Any thought Alitalia could be a vehicle for EasyJet to secure a European air operator's certificate to protect its 
European route rights, ended when the carrier announced plans earlier this month that it has opted to obtain an 
AOC and operating licence from Austrian regulators.
And while the Luton-based carrier finds unions more palatable than its Irish rival – which doesn't recognise them – 
the prospect of trying to unpick the labour challenges at Alitalia might seem daunting.
EasyJet has shown a greater enthusiasm for acquisitions than Ryanair, but mostly in its earlier years. In 1998, it 
purchased a 40% stake in Swiss operator TEA Basel to gain access to the non-EU country, rebranding it as 
EasyJet Switzerland. It also showed interest in Air Holland, French airline Air Liberte-AOM and German operator 
Deutsche BA – but in none of these cases did a deal emerge.
In those cases where EasyJet did show interest, early on, it was largely driven by a desire to build scale, particularly 
as the carrier strove to develop its presence outside of the UK.
ANALYSIS: Why are low-cost giants interested in Alitalia 's sale? EasyJet and Ryanair have both expressed

EasyJet's largest airline acquisition was London Stansted-based carrier Go in 2002, enlarging its operations 
significantly. Go's brand and operations were subsequently merged into EasyJet, which later acquired Gatwick-
based GB Airways – excluding its London Heathrow slots – in a move aimed at fast-tracking its growth at the south 
London airport.
That move for GB was made in 2007, and in the decade since there has been no acquisition activity involving 
EasyJet – though the airline was linked last year with potential interest in UK leisure operation Monarch Airlines.
Ultimately, low-cost carriers – both within Europe and globally – have little track record of acquiring network carriers 
of the size of Alitalia. Ryanair's move for Aer Lingus is the only comparable move in Europe – and the politics 
involved in O'Leary maximising pressure on its then state-owned rival offers a specific dimension to that case.
That too, potentially, applied in 2012 when Tony Fernandes' AirAsia embarked on a planned cross-ownership deal 
with national carrier Malaysia Airlines – a deal which was aborted within a year.
Brazilian carrier Gol did, however, acquire the successor to collapsed national carrier Varig in 2007. That move, 
particularly the acquisition of the Varig frequent-flyer programme, supported Gol's attempts to strengthen its 
position in business markets. But the related move into long-haul operations was to prove short-lived.
What might in the end put EasyJet and Ryanair off bidding for Alitalia is that both have demonstrated they can 
develop in new markets within the EU through their own activities – without any need to suffer the complications of 
growth by acquisition.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary sees a “real prospect” that there will be no flights between the UK and the 
EU for a period following Brexit.
Addressing the European Parliament’s transport and tourism committee on 11 July, O’Leary warned that flights 
could cease for “weeks or months” once the UK exits the bloc in March 2019.
If the UK “sticks to its position” of having “red lines” on the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and on 
freedom of movement, he says, “they are going to leave the EU and they are going to leave open skies”.
Gaining readmission to the European open skies regime or agreeing a separate bilateral access deal with the 27 
remaining EU members is an “impossibility”, he believes, because “there’s no goodwill in Europe towards Britain 
and [towards] allowing them back in on preferential terms to open skies or its equivalent”.
O’Leary says that the desire of Air France and Lufthansa to gain a competitive advantage from Brexit should not be 
underestimated. His own airline intends to cancel flights from the UK unless legal certainty over operating rules is 
established by September 2018. Aircraft would be reallocated to European regional airports from April 2019, says 
O’Leary.
TUI Group’s director of international public policy, group corporate and external affairs Ralf Pastleitner spoke at the 
same committee hearing, and quoted a report produced for the leisure group that estimated the cost of a “hard 
Brexit” at a combined 210 billion ($241 billion) in lost GDP for Europe and the UK.
Acknowledging this to be an “extreme scenario”, Pastleitner says the forecast assumes EU-UK air traffic will come 
to a stop, with only a certain portion substituted by other modes of transport.

He says there will be a “reduction in round-trips, for sure” following Brexit, and possibly less competition on 
remaining routes. Bilateral agreements signed before the liberalisation of European aviation in 1992 are an 
“insufficient basis for the future”, he argues.

In the seven years since Carolyn McCall became chief executive of easyJet, she has gone from being dismissed by 
her fiercest rivals to winning their open admiration.
Michael O'Leary, the head of rival Ryanair, who once labelled the former Guardian Media Group boss a "media 
luvvie", said the airline industry would have been poorer without her.
"I clearly underestimated her and I was proved wrong," he said. "She forced us to up our game on customer 
service.
EasyJet and the industry are better as a result of her tenure."
Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways parent International Airlines Group, said he was "sorry to see 
Carolyn leave the aviation industry. She's done a good job."
News of Dame Carolyn's decision to quit Europe's second biggest low-cost carrier to go to UK broadcaster ITV 
comes two months after the airline unveiled its biggest interim loss in six years, and eight months after a 28 per 
cent decline in 2016 profits.
In its defence, many European airlines have struggled with the impact of terrorist attacks in Europe, currency, and a 
capacity glut, which has hit fares.
Behind the headline numbers, Dame Carolyn's tenure at the airline has brought passenger numbers to record 
highs, while its planes have never been as full. In the past seven years, some £1.2bn has been paid out in 
Critics won over in seven years at easyJet controls
dividends. And despite last year's setback, easyJet's share price has almost quadrupled from the opening price of 
382p on the day she took over, and the airline has moved into the FTSE 100.
Even the competitive Mr O'Leary says the recent blip in profits should not be exaggerated. "They are still by a long 
way the second most profitable low-cost airline in Europe," he says.
Ms McCall arrived at easyJet with a brief, first, to resolve a damaging row over strategy with its Cypriot founder 
Stelios Haji-Ioannou, and second to restore the reputation of an airline notorious for delays and struggling to digest 
years of frantic expansion.
Now easyJet is facing new strategic challenges, the most immediate of which is Brexit. Dame Carolyn's successor 
will also have to respond to competition. Peggy Hollinger

The good news for any prospective chief executive of easyJet is that the incumbent will take care of the most 
immediate challenge. The bad news is that bigger, less wieldy risks lie over the horizon.
Yesterday, easyJet confirmed that its chief executive of seven years, Carolyn McCall, would leave to take the same 
role at broadcaster ITV. But she will remain at the airline until the end of this year, and so will present thirdquarter 
numbers this week and fullyear results due in late November. That could be tricky. The shares have rallied strongly 
and are not far off pre-Brexit vote levels. As a result, they trade at a higher multiple of earnings than rivals Ryanair, 
Wizz Air and Norwegian - even though there have been few upgrades to analysts' forecasts. Investors clearly 
expect good news.
The calendar could help supply it: Easter this year fell in the third fiscal quarter. Exchange rates have also moved a 
little in the company's favour.
In yesterday's statement, it said that load factors had been strong and nonfuel costs contained. These are all useful 
developments, but it is hard to see them transforming the outlook.
EasyJet is expanding capacity this year and next, mostly by adding larger aircraft to existing routes. Even allowing 
for a £250m reduction in capital spending announced at the halfyear results, that could in time put free cash flow 
under pressure. Strong demand and pricing could offset that.
But if low fuel costs encourage rivals to add capacity, yields may come under pressure. Unlike rival Ryanair, 
easyJet pays regular dividends. That partly reflects the priorities of its founder and major shareholder Stelios Haji-
Ioannou. But it could limit financial flexibility.

Then there is Brexit. Dame Carolyn has done what she can to prepare easyJet for the UK's departure from the EU. 
Last week, the airline said it would set up an Austrian subsidiary with a European air operator's certificate for intra-
EU routes. The nature of post-2019 governance for UK-EU flights remains unclear. So far, Britons have shown few 
signs of cutting back on trips overseas. That too could change.
So Dame Carolyn's successor will have to navigate Brexit and keep a volatile major shareholder onside while 
executing an ambitious expansion plan. It is enough to make running a free-to-air broadcaster look easy.

Sir, Martin Wolf should take a deep breath and count to 10. We all know that the journalist's job is to fill column 
inches and to sell newspapers, or these days, to generate clicks and page views - if you don't get read, you don't 
get fed. However, Mr Wolf's musings on the prospects for post-Brexit Britain and in particular the conduct of the 
negotiations ("Britain is incapable of managing Brexit and calamity will follow", July 14) have become almost 
hysterical.
The negotiations with the EU have barely begun and already Mr Wolf is, well, crying wolf. Does he not understand 
how negotiations work? The protagonists set out their respective positions on the key issues; they then posture, 
pontificate and prevaricate.
Brickbats are thrown, denunciations are issued, perhaps one or other party walks out at some point, and then they 
get back to the business of negotiating a compromise because that is what ultimately makes sense for both sides.
Mr Wolf is correct that the Conservatives are split over Brexit - the country is split, the referendum result showed us 
that. He is also correct that the general election result has weakened the government's authority. Perhaps there 
should be another referendum in an attempt to settle the matter. However, in assessing the balance of interests at 
stake Mr Wolf persists in looking at only one side. It is an indisputable fact that the British economy would be 
damaged if trade relations broke down between the UK and the EU, but is that really likely to happen given the 
enormous losses that would be incurred on the other side of the channel? If easyJet and Ryanair stop flying to 
Carcassonne and Cagliari, would this really be in the interests of the citizens of those places? Perhaps the EU and 
the leaders of its member states are prepared to sacrifice the economic interests of their people to make a bigger 
political point, but if that is really the case, would that not rather support the rationale for Brexit? Mr Wolf and others

Sir, Martin Wolf should take a deep breath and count to 10. We all know that the journalist's job is to fill column 
inches and to sell newspapers, or these days, to generate clicks and page views - if you don't get read, you don't 
get fed. However, Mr Wolf's musings on the prospects for post-Brexit Britain and in particular the conduct of the 
negotiations ("Britain is incapable of managing Brexit and calamity will follow", July 14) have become almost 
hysterical.

AThe successor at Easyjet may face S BREXIT looms, Easyjet is setting up a European HQ in Austria. But Carolyn 
McCall, at the helm of the airline for seven years, won't be shuttling weekly between its Luton base and the Austrian 
capital. Instead, she is flying towards ITV where she will become the new CEO following the exit of Adam Crozier. 
When she lands, what will be in her in tray? First up, the broadcaster's share price. At 177p, it is down 14 per cent 
in the year-to-date as the slowdown in advertising spend at traditional media outlets bites. The resulting valuation 
has seen ITV mooted as a takeover target for those who may be looking to take advantage of sterling's weakness. 
Liberty Global is tipped as an acquirer. Analysts are confident that McCall can pilot ITV to a higher altitude with 
investors. Calling ITV his "top pick", Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker cites her strong personal links, for example with 
government. From a media perspective, she was once CEO of Guardian Media Group. "We remain confident on 
the structural position of the free-to-air broadcasting space in general and ITV in particular, and that concerns have 
been overdone," Whittaker concludes. According to Roddy Davidson at Shore Capital, ITV's medium-term 
attractions include an unrivalled ability to deliver a mass market commercial audience to advertisers via "a trusted 
and well understood medium"; the scale and commercial value of its content portfolio; and the prospect of solid 
earnings growth. The successor at Easyjet may face far stronger headwinds. McCall's departure, confirmed 
yesterday, comes as the business repositions itself in the face of Brexit. There remains anxiety, shared by Ryanair, 
over the ease of flying between the UK and EU come March 2019. Despite expectations of a solid third quarter 
update from Easyjet on 20 July, Mark Irvine-Fortescue at Panmure Gordon sees the airline far stronger headwinds 
buffeted by "mediocre cost progress and nagging operational concerns". The analysts' views are born out by 
differing share price reactions on yesterday's appointment. Easyjet shares slid nearly one per cent on the open and 
ITV's rose two per cent, a signal that its investors see McCall as a steady hand on the controls. It seems that 
Easyjet's loss is ITV's gain.

Independent Alliance row over O’Leary speech

Highlight: Concerns have been raised by some members over Ryanair boss's views
Body
A row broke out in the Independent Alliance earlier this year over plans to have Ryanair chief executive Michael 
O’Leary address a conference that has been repeatedly postponed.
The Alliance had hoped to hold an event for its TDs and councillors as far back as March of this year, but concerns 
were raised by some members over O’Leary’s views.
One Alliance minister said that O’Leary was “not unanimously popular”, while another source said that “some 
people just don’t want him there”.
O’Leary has previously described independent TDs as “lunatics” who have held past governments to ransom.
Despite the criticism, the airline boss told senior Alliance minister Shane Ross in April that he was looking forward 
to addressing any event that is held.
But there was also a dispute among members over holding the event on a Friday.
Alliance sources said that O’Leary would only address an event held on a weekday.
But Alliance ministers John Halligan and Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran vetoed it, pointing out that many of the councillors 
affiliated to the political grouping wanted it to be held on the weekend.
Halligan said this weekend that he would not agree with everything O’Leary says, but would not have a problem 
with him speaking at any future event. Moran did not respond to calls.
It is now hoped that a conference can be organised in September, but no speakers have been confirmed.
A spokesman for the Alliance said: “There were some discussions earlier in the year that didn’t come to fruition. 
There were a number of names of possible speakers, including Michael O’Leary.”
Independent Alliance row over O’Leary speech
O’Leary has previously addressed both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil events where he has raised eyebrows with some 
of his comments.
Last October, he told a Fine Gael fundraiser that gardaí who go on strike should be sacked and described RTÉ as a 
“North Korean rat-infested union shop”.
In December, he told a similar event held by Fianna Fáil TD Robert Troy that the trade union movement had done 
“fuck all for anybody for the past 60 years” and said that the current Dáil was “the worst assembly of half-wits and 
lunatics”.
A spokesman for Ryanair said that nothing had been arranged with O’Leary. However, the spokesman added: 
“Having previously spoken to both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil groupings, he is looking forward to speaking to the 
Independent Alliance.”

EasyJet will establish a Vienna-based airline so that it can continue its European operations after Brexit, as UK 
carriers look to minimise disruption and maintain flights in the continent from 2019.
"EasyJet Europe" will allow the lowcost airline to continue to run flights in European countries, even if the UK and 
EU fail to sign a deal that preserves all benefits of the single aviation market.
EU rules state that an airline must be based in Europe in order to fly across the continent.
EasyJet said yesterday that its application for an "air operating certificate" in Austria was "well advanced", and final 
approval was expected in the coming weeks. The move will create up to 20 administrative jobs on the Continent, 
and the airline's staff in the EU will now work for the new company.
The establishment of a base in Austria means the group will become a pan-European airline, with businesses 
registered in Austria, the UK and Switzerland. This will allow its UK aircraft to operate UK-EU routes and its 
Austrian aircraft to operate intra-EU routes, even if UK carriers are not granted access to the single aviation market.
It does not solve all the airline's Brexit troubles. EU rules limit non-EU ownership and control of an airline to 50 per 
cent, and easyJet has warned that it is set to exceed this threshold once its UK shareholders are no longer classed 
as EU nationals.

Warning on ownership threshold
Analysts warn that the airlines have provisions in their bylaws to force non-EU shareholders to sell, should their 
operating licence be under threat, and may use them if necessary.
This week Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways and Iberia, 
called for the rules to be relaxed, saying the EU "operates under an arcane system regulating the ownership and 
control of airlines".
EasyJet said that it would "continue to push for the UK and EU to reach an aviation agreement which, at a mini-
mum, will enable flights between the UK and EU".
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of rival Ryanair, this week warned that there was a "real possibility" of flights 
between the EU and UK stopping after Brexit, and said other large European airlines hoped to squeeze out UK and 
Irish competitors.
Thomas Krupp, senior vice-president at Lufthansa, said Brexit could bring "thorough and quite terrible 
consequences" for his airline, potentially damaging economic growth and damping appetite for air travel across 
Europe. But he insisted that UK airlines should not be allowed to join the single aviation market without abiding by 
the same laws as EU airlines.
"What we don't want is for different legislation to apply within the single market. The same rules should always 
apply," he said.
EasyJet expects the Austrian move to have no impact on passengers or schedules, and said it had chosen the 
country due to the similarities between its safety regulator and the UK's.
"The criteria for selection were rooted in finding a regulator that would be the best fit for easyJet," said the 
company, which wanted to ensure it was not working with three different safety management systems.
Austro Control - the Austrian regulator - had a "rigorous" approach to safety regulation, it said.

Brexit means Brexit, UK prime minister Theresa May infamously explained. What Brexit means for aviation and 
aerospace is far from certain.
What we know is that, following the June 2016 referendum and the triggering of Article 50, in less than 90 weeks’ 
time the UK will no longer be a member of the EU. Without a deal between London and Brussels, that could mean a 
departure from the open skies agreement that allows UK-based airlines and their passengers to fly anywhere within 
the bloc.
For aerospace manufacturers, it will end the UK’s membership of the customs union and their ability to import and 
export their products without tarrifs, quotas or border formalities. The remit of the European Aviation Safety Agency 
in the UK will similarly expire.Airline bosses such as Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary have warned of chaos if there is no 
settlement. The aerospace trade body ADS has likewise said a “hard Brexit” that leaves suppliers unable to access 
the single market would be a disaster for UK manufacturing.
Ministers, meanwhile, are resorting to that trusted wartime mantra: “Keep calm and carry on”. In other words, we 
cannot tell you much, but fear not – we have your interests at heart and it will work out in the end.
For many, patience with platitudes is running out. Industry needs visibility on what will happen after March 2019 
now – not days before the Brexit deadline.
How is UK industry prepared for Brexit?

The UK government is "taking seriously" aviation industry concerns about Brexit, transport secretary Chris Grayling 
has declared.
Speaking at an Aviation Club luncheon yesterday, Grayling said the sector "is very high on the government's radar" 
in negotiations with Brussels.
He also affirmed that ministers remained "very committed" to a third runway at London Heathrow and would begin 
the legislative process to start the project "early" next year.
The UK's new 30-year aviation strategy – to be published "soon", Grayling promises – will include proposals to 
"modernise our airspace" by reforming an air traffic management system that would otherwise bring a "massive 
increase in delays" by 2030, he says.
On the UK's exit from the EU, Grayling states the government's aim to "provide the best possible access to 
European aviation markets", and that, although ministers are unable to make any detailed pronouncements while 
negotiations are taking place, aviation is a top priority.
He told the audience of aviation professionals: "I don't want you to think we are not taking this seriously because we 
are."
A day earlier, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary warned a European parliamentary committee that flights 
between the UK and the remaining EU nations could cease for "weeks or months" if it exited the bloc in March 2019 
without an agreement on replacing the current open-skies deal.
Referring to the third-runway proposal, Grayling says that despite the absence of a mention of Heathrow in the 
government's legislative programme – laid out in the 21 June Queen's Speech – ministers are "very committed to 
Aviation's concerns 'high on the radar' as UK negotiates Brexit The UK government is "taking seriously"

bringing this project forward", noting: "I am very proud to be the secretary of state to start the ball rolling on a third 
runway."
He adds that there "is widespread support [for a third runway] across parliament", and that the new capacity will 
"make a real difference" to regional connections within the UK and improve the country's trade links post-Brexit.

Far too British Airways One unexpected upside from a "Hard(er) Brexit" may be cheaper giant Toblerones. But will 
this be enough to compensate airline investors for suddenly cheaper shares? Last year, the triangular chocolate 
bars conspicuously sold at airports became stealthily more expensive. Their shape and weight were changed to 
pass on higher costs to consumers.
However, if Britain is unable to negotiate new travel deals with Brussels, one consequence may be the return of EU 
duty free sales. One other consequence, though, may be the forced selling of shares in International Airlines Group, 
easyJet and Ryanair.
Earlier this week, IAG chief executive Willie Walsh alluded to the latter risk, by calling for a transport agreement that 
resolves the problem of EU ownership rules. These state that, to operate intra-EU flights, airlines must be at least 
50 per cent owned by EU nationals. Post-Brexit, when UK shareholders no longer count as EU nationals, IAG's 
investor base is set to become majority non-EU.
EasyJet faces a similar problem - although less so if the shares of founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou are classified under 
his Cypriot nationality. Then, yesterday, Ryanair said it may have found its own solution, by having pension fund 
investors move their shares to EU entities - despite lawyers suggesting this is a grey area, as it is the ultimate 
owners that count.
Far too British Airways UK COMPANIES
IAG currently uses trust structures to ensure correct national ownership of its British Airways and Iberia units. But 
the EU is now focused on holding company ownership - and can force share sales, or loss of voting rights, to meet 
the 50 per cent EU quota.
With travel group Tui estimating that the three airlines account for (EURO)21bn of EU tourism revenues, a travel 
deal is likely to remain a bargaining chip late into Brexit negotiations. And the longer forced share sales stay on the 
table, the greater the potential stock overhang. Why, then, are shares in IAG, easyJet and Ryanair all up in the past 
month? Could it be that investors are hoping for a giant fudge? matthew.vincent@ft.com

(EU) after Brexit.
Body
Irish airline Ryanair has threatened to cancel flight services between the UK and the European Union (EU) after 
Brexit.In a statement, Ryanair chief executive officer Michael O'Leary told the European Parliament's Transport and 
Tourism Committee that flights will remain cancelled for several months after Brexit unless a new aviation deal 
between the UK and the EU is signed, reported the Independent.Major airline and airport executives have warned 
that the tourism industry in the 27 EU countries could incur a loss of approximately 21bn in business from the 
country following Brexit.Airlines will have to make business decisions about where to fly before the March 2019 
deadline, whenBritain is expected to exit the EU.If a Brexit deal is not finalised by then, the UK will leave the EU 
without an agreement."There is a real prospect, and we need to deal with this, that there are going to be no flights 
between the UK and Europe for a period of weeks [or] months beyond March 2019."O'Leary said that the lack of a 
deal could mean no flight services between the UK and EU-27 immediately after Brexit.He was quoted by The 
Telegraph as saying: "There is a real prospect, and we need to deal with this, that there are going to be no flights 
between the UK and Europe for a period of weeks[or] months beyond March 2019."There is not going to be an 
interim agreement, there is not going to be a legal basis, we will be cancelling flights, we will be cancelling people's 
holidays for summer of 2019."The Brexit negotiations are being handled by the European Commission (EC) on 
behalf of the EU.The EC has refused to discuss anything regarding the negotiations until a settlement on people's 
rights and the Brexit bill has been reached.However, O'Leary has warned that the aviation industry will not wait that 
long and that a clear legal framework was required by September next year.Ryanair intends to take several of their 
aircraft out of Britain from April 2019 and reallocate them to various regional airports across Europe.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - Lithuanian aviation officials say that hundreds of thousands of airline passengers will be 
diverted for more than a month as the country's main airport near the capital will be shut for a major renovation.
Vilnius International Airport, with a single 2.5-kilometer (2,735-yard) runway, will close Friday until Aug. 17. Some 
4,350 flights will be diverted - affecting 400,000 passengers - to two smaller airports, one in Kaunas, 100 kilometers 
(60 miles) west of Vilnius airport and the other in remote Palanga, 300 kilometers (185 miles) away.
Some airlines, including Ryanair, have canceled all scheduled flights until September, and several popular direct 
flights between Vilnius and Madrid, Liverpool and Malta will not be flown during the closure.
With 3.8 million annual passengers last year, Vilnius is among the fastest-growing airports in Europe.

International Airlines Group has pleaded for the EU to overhaul its "arcane" airline ownership laws, which rivals and 
analysts warn might force the owner of British Airways and of Iberia to buy out a quarter of its shareholders or risk 
being broken up after Brexit.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, told the European Parliament on Tuesday that he was "confident" that the 
company's structures would survive Brexit and meet the EU's strict licensing rules.
But in his first admission of potential challenges, Mr Walsh called for the UK and EU to reach a comprehensive air 
transport agreement that "should also clarify" that UK nationals would count towards the EU ownership 
requirements, even after Brexit. Speaking to a group of MEPs, Mr Walsh said the EU "operates under an arcane 
system regulating the ownership and control of airlines", and called for the rules to be relaxed.
"Those structures are unnecessary," he said. "I would prefer to see a situation whereby we don't have to replicate."
For an airline to operate routes in the EU, it must show that it is effectively owned and controlled by EU nationals, 
with at least 50 per cent of its shares held by EU nationals. This poses a problem for UK airlines after Brexit, when 
their UK shareholders will no longer be classed as EU shareholders.

Several independent estimates point to IAG falling below 50 per cent after Brexit, a problem shared with other 
airlines. EU officials, analysts and rivals of IAG have told the FT that, unless the UK and EU reach an agreement to 
waive the issue, IAG will be forced to spin off part of the group or buy out up to a quarter of its shareholder base in 
order to maintain lucrative EU flying rights.
Andrew Lobbenberg, head of transport equities at HSBC, said: "After Brexit, we think IAG will need to be 
demonstrably an EU-owned and controlled airline. But it is unclear how that gets to be the case."
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary, a critic of IAG and of its Irish carrier Aer Lingus, said the airline was "in 
complete ... denial" about the ownership challenge. "They're hoping that it'll go away. They'll have to front up to how 
catastrophic it is at some point though. They don't know themselves [how to solve it]. But their shareholders will 
have to sell, and the group has to get broken up."
Brian Havel, an Oxford aviation law professor, said IAG "could not exist in its current form" after Brexit.
In the past Mr Walsh, pictured, has said he has "absolutely no concerns" about the IAG structure, which ensures 
that all three of its carriers are able to maintain their national flying rights in Spain, the UK and Ireland, and has 
denied that the group will need to be broken up.
IAG said that it would "continue to comply with all the relevant ownership and control regulations".
Unlike some other airlines, IAG has refused to reveal what proportion of its current shareholders would still be EU 
nationals after Brexit.
A clause in the company's bylaws allows the IAG board to determine which "bona fide" interested parties can be 
given information on the group's shareholder breakdown on request.
The FT asked for such information, but was told that its request was not "bona fide".
Stephen Furlong, analyst at Davy, estimates the group will be 20 per cent owned by EU nationals after Brexit in 
2019. Bloomberg data suggest the same.
One independent financial analysis circulating in the industry suggests that, even in the best-case scenario, where 
all those shares whose ownership is difficult to trace are classified as belonging to EU nationals, IAG remains 6 per 
cent short of the 50 per cent limit.
IAG has provisions in its bylaws to force non-EU shareholders to sell their shares if the company is at risk of losing 
its flying rights.
The EU takes the issue of ownership requirements seriously, and has previously investigated airlines where it 
suspects non-EU ownership has dropped below 50 per www.cent.UK airlines were hoping that guidelines on 
ownership and control issued by the European Commission last month would loosen the rules.
Instead, they merely reinforced the status quo and confirmed that the EU would consider "effective control" - 
specifically, the entities or persons that ultimately own the shares - when deciding if an airline is majority-controlled 
by EU nationals.
Other airlines have been more explicit about the challenges that ownership rules will pose after Brexit. EasyJet has 
said it will be 49 per cent owned by EU nationals after Brexit, while Ryanair said 38 per cent of its shareholder base 
would be EU-owned and controlled.
Mr O'Leary said that he hoped to make up some of the shortfall by encouraging pension funds to switch from 
holding shares in the UK to the EU, but warned that up to 10 per cent of his non-EU shareholders - potentially 
including UK nationals - "may be forced to sell their shares or be disenfranchised".

suspects non-EU ownership has dropped below 50 per www.cent.UK airlines were hoping that guidelines on 
ownership and control issued by the European Commission last month would loosen the rules.
Instead, they merely reinforced the status quo and confirmed that the EU would consider "effective control" - 
specifically, the entities or persons that ultimately own the shares - when deciding if an airline is majority-controlled 
by EU nationals.
Other airlines have been more explicit about the challenges that ownership rules will pose after Brexit. EasyJet has 
said it will be 49 per cent owned by EU nationals after Brexit, while Ryanair said 38 per cent of its shareholder base 
would be EU-owned and controlled.
Mr O'Leary said that he hoped to make up some of the shortfall by encouraging pension funds to switch from 
holding shares in the UK to the EU, but warned that up to 10 per cent of his non-EU shareholders - potentially 
including UK nationals - "may be forced to sell their shares or be disenfranchised".

Michael O'Leary says Brexit may lead to more share buybacks at Ryanair

Ryanair could speed up share buybacks to comply with European Union ownership laws as a result of Britain 
leaving the EU, the Irish carrier's chief executive said on Tuesday.
To qualify as an EU airline carriers have to be majority owned by EU investors. Ryanair was 53.6% owned by EU 
nationals, including UK investors in 2016, according to the airline.
And Michael O'Leary said around 20% of Ryanair's shareholders are UK-based. The carrier has already been 
carrying out share buybacks to return cash to shareholders.
"Ownership post Brexit is a real issue," O'Leary told a hearing in the European Parliament. "It might help me to 
accelerate the share buyback if UK shareholders are forced to sell."
Like other European airlines, Ryanair has clauses in its articles of association that mean it can force non-EU 
shareholders to sell their shares in order to ensure that EU investors retain the majority.
He reiterated concerns that unless a deal is agreed for Brexit then flights between Britain and the remaining EU 27 
countries could be grounded.
"There is not a legal mechanism on which airlines can operate in a 'hard Brexit, no deal' outcome. There will simply 
be no flights," he said, adding that Ryanair would start canceling flights six months before the March 2019 date 
when Britain is due to leave the EU with or without a deal.
Aviation is not covered by World Trade Organisation rules which would apply to other industries should Britain fail to 
agree a deal by March 2019.
Michael O'Leary says Brexit may lead to more share buybacks at Ryanair
Willie Walsh, CEO of British Airways parent IAG, said he did not agree with O'Leary's assessment and that he 
believed there would be a solution. He called on the UK to agree a liberal air transport agreement with the EU.
One suggestion is that in the absence of a deal on aviation by March 2019 EU national governments could revert to 
the old bilateral agreements with the UK governing air traffic rights. O'Leary said, however, that individual EU 
member states were unlikely to be allowed to negotiate bilaterals independently. (Reuters)

IAG chief executive Willie Walsh is lobbying for a comprehensive air transport agreement that would give airlines 
from the UK and the 27 remaining EU member nations "all the freedoms of the air" post-Brexit.
Addressing the European Parliament's transport and tourism committee on 11 July, Walsh urged negotiators from 
both sides to conclude an agreement that was "similar" to, if not "more open" than, the open-skies frameworks the 
European bloc has with the USA, Canada and other third-party states.
Such an agreement should allow airlines from each side to operate "between and within each other's territories", 
argues Walsh.
"It should also clarify that airlines in the UK and the EU27 can continue to be owned by nationals of either party 
without the need for complex ownership and control structures being put in place," he says.
"With policy support, it should be relatively straightforward to agree a deal on aviation that will be ready when the 
UK leaves the EU."
He stresses the urgency of the situation, noting that – unlike other sectors – aviation cannot "fall back" on World 
Travel Organization rules, while air tickets need to be sold a year in advance, creating a need for "certainty" by 
March 2018, or 12 months before the UK is due to leave the EU.
The IAG chief believes the UK should remain a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency. He says the 
aviation industry recognises that the UK "contributes significantly" to the work of the agency and he is eager for this 
to continue.

He suggests some a "joint committee or some other form" of governance framework could be put in place to 
facilitate this.
Reacting to concerns expressed by Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary that flights between the UK and the 
rest of the EU could temporarily cease after Brexit, Walsh said he remained "optimistic" that "we will see a 
resolution to the challenges that we face and that Ryanair will continue to fly between the UK and Europe".
Walsh declares: "I would hate to see a situation where Ryanair is unable to operate flights from the UK to the EU27, 
in the same way as I would hate to see a case where EasyJet is unable to operate flights within the EU27."

Ukraine urges Ryanair to resume flight talks Airport dispute
Ukraine urges Ryanair to resume flight talks; Airport dispute

Ukraine's prime minister has appealed to Ryanair to resume talks about flights to the country after a political row 
escalated over the airline's decision to cancel its plans.
Volodymyr Groysman said yesterday that the country had "decided to renew the negotiation process with Ryanair", 
a day after the airline accused Kiev's airport of failing to honour a deal. Ukraine was "not yet a sufficiently mature or 
reliable business location to invest", Ryanair said.
The collapse of talks with Europe's largest budget airline provoked anger on Ukrainian social media. It comes a 
month after the implementation of an agreement to allow visa-free travel to the EU promised Ukrainians closer, 
cheaper and easier access to the west.
Volodymyr Omelyan, Ukraine's transport minister, accused Pavlo Riabikin, Boryspil airport's chief executive, of 
sabotaging talks and trying to protect Ukraine International Airlines , which is co-owned by Igor Kolomoisky, one of 
the country's most influential oligarchs.
Mr Riabikin denied wrongdoing and claimed that other national airports had also failed to reach agreement with 
Ryanair, saying the carrier was asking for concessions that could incur vast airport losses. Ukraine International 
Airlines denied any interference in the talks.
Ukraine urges Ryanair to resume flight talks Airport dispute
Mr Groysman called for an investigation of "a situation which has drawn broad public and political" resonance but 
urged officials to finalise months of negotiations with Ryanair. "As politicians argue over who is to blame, our 
passengers are suffering," he added.
The prime minister's reaction highlights the embarrassment in Kiev, where the pro-western leadership has invested 
heavily in easing travel to Europe . EU leaders are also due in Kiev this week for a two-day summit at which they 
are likely to call for Ukraine to speed up patchy reforms and combat widespread political corruption.
Ryanair said on Monday it would cancel 11 planned routes from the UK, Netherlands and other European 
destinations to Kiev and Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine. "Regrettably, Kiev airport has ... chosen to protect 
high fare airlines (including Ukraine International Airlines) and deprive Ukrainian consumers/visitors access to 
Europe's lowest air fares and widest route network," the company said.
Nearly 100,000 Ukrainians have made short EU visits under the visa-free regime since its launch on June 11. Petro 
Poroshenko, Ukraine's president, has hailed the scheme as break from invasive visa applications and "a final 
goodbye to the Russian Empire".

TOP AIRLINE bosses touched down in the European Parliament yesterday to push for a frictionless UK-EU airline 
deal before Britain departs in 2019 . Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and Willie Walsh, chief executive of British 
Airways parent IAG, told a hearing in Brussels that an air transport deal with the EU was required as aviation is not 
covered by the World Trade Organization rules that apply to other industries.
Walsh was positive the two sides would reach a solution, but O'Leary hinted major flight cancellations were possible 
post-Brexit, saying: "There is not a legal mechanism on which airlines can operate in a 'hard Brexit, no deal'

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. shares turned lower after opening on a firm note as the 
pound strengthened and Marks & Spencer Group reported disappointing fiscal first-quarter sales figures.  Amid little 
positive triggers, investors looked ahead to testimony from Fed chair Janet Yellen this week for clues on the timing 
of the next U.S. rate hike. 
 The benchmark FTSE 100 was down 47 points or 0.64 percent at 7,322 in late opening deals after rising 0.3 
percent the previous day.   Pearson shares plunged 8 percent as the publishing and education company 
announced an agreement to sell a 22 percent stake in the Penguin Random House Venture.  Retailer Marks & 
Spencer Group tumbled more than 4 percent after reporting a decline in quarterly sales on a like-for-like basis, 
weighed down by its troubled clothing business.    Infrastructure and construction firm Carillion fell as much as 15 
percent to extend Monday's sell-off after warning on revenues and debts.   Banks Barclays and HSBC Holdings 
traded mixed after a survey carried out by PwC on behalf of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) found that 
optimism about the business environment among Britain's financial services firms declined in the second quarter of 
this year due to Brexit uncertainty.   Sainsbury lost 1.3 percent as rival Waitrose upped its commitment to use the 
Fairtrade logo on its teas.   A sustained rally in iron ore prices lifted miners, with Anglo American, Antofagasta and 
Glencore rising over 1 percent each.  Ryanair Holdings edged up 0.2 percent as the Irish budget carrier canceled its 
planned entry into Ukraine.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) said Tuesday that it has cancelled its planned entry into Ukraine after Kiev airport's 
"failure to honour a growth agreement reached at the Ministry of Infrastructure with airport officials and the current 
Airport Director General" of March this year.
"Regrettably, Kiev airport has instead chosen to protect high fare airlines (including Ukraine International Airlines) 
and deprive Ukrainian consumers/visitors access to Europe's lowest air fares and widest route network," Ryanair 
said in a regulatory filing. "As a result, Ryanair has no choice but to cancel four new Kiev routes and seven new 
Lviv routes, which will result in the loss of over 500,000 passengers and 400 jobs."
Ryanair said it will now transfer the capacity to competing markets, such as Germany, Israel and Poland It said that 
it plans to grow from 130 million passengers this year to 200 million passengers by 2024 and "retains the hope that 
Ukraine might participate in this growth at some point in the future."

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair announced that it has cancelled its planned entry into Ukraine following Kiev 
airport's failure to honour a growth agreement reached at the Ministry of Infrastructure with airport officials and the 
current Airport Director General, Mr Riabikin, in March of this year.  Regrettably, Kiev airport has instead chosen to 
protect high fare airlines (including Ukraine International Airlines) and deprive Ukrainian consumers/visitors access 
to Europe's lowest air fares and widest route network. As a result, Ryanair has no choice but to cancel 4 new Kiev 
routes and 7 new Lviv routes, which will result in the loss of over 500,000 passengers and 400 jobs.  Ryanair noted 
that it will now transfer capacity to competing markets, such as Germany, Israel and Poland instead. Ryanair will 
grow from 130 million passengers this year to 200 million passengers by 2024 and retains the hope that Ukraine 
might participate in this growth at some point in the future.

Since the barnstorming days of Sir Freddie Laker’s Skytrain, various airlines have tried to operate or talked up the 
potential of low-cost transatlantic services – with limited success. Europe’s best-known no-frills flag-waver, 
Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary, promised US flights a decade ago. They have never materialised. British Airways owner 
IAG is luring budget-conscious millennials to its Barcelona-based Level offshoot, while Air France plans its own low-
cost unit, Boost, offering long-haul services from later this year.
However, it is Norwegian that is really shifting the baseline, not just by introducing more low-cost transatlantic 
routes than anyone, but using single-aisles – in its case Boeing 737 Max 8s. Chief executive Bjørn Kjos believes 
the twinjet’s economics will allow the carrier to fly the type full to secondary airports – several of which have 
restricted runway lengths – “on very low fares”.
Boeing
If the sums continue to add up for the Oslo-based airline when services begin next month – and the backpackers, 
students and long-weekenders it is targeting prove resilient to flying frills-free for seven hours on a narrowbody – 
Kjos and his team will have achieved a remarkable breakthrough in aviation.
However, like any successful trail-blazer, Norwegian is unlikely to have the market to itself. Expect to see more 
operators of Boeing and Airbus narrowbodies plying their trade over the Atlantic in the coming years.

Highlight: The youngest Kardashians' 'vintage T-shirts' were pulled from their website within hours after legal 
threats, showing that the social media jury is quicker and more merciless than any court 
Body
Kendall and Kylie Jenner, the two youngest sisters of the Kardashian clan, are paying for their latest bout of tone-
deaf branding with legal threats from the the estate of 1960s rock band the Doors.
The pair’s “vintage T-shirts”, featuring their faces placed over pictures of musical superstars such as the Doors, the 
Notorious BIG, Tupac Shakur and Ozzy Osbourne, were touted as “one of a kind”. Perhaps the idea was that 
because of all the Instagram likes they’ve collectively racked up, the Kardashians now transcend these cultural 
personalities. Maybe it was a type of cultural comparison? Kendall and Kylie might be trying to tell us their cultural 
influence through Instagram is just as powerful as Biggie Smalls’s lyrics.
Whatever the thinking, it didn’t fly. Voletta Wallace, mother of the late Notorious BIG, called the T-shirts 
“disrespectful”, “disgusting” and “exploitation at its worst”. As social media took its vengeance, the T-shirts were 
pulled from their website within hours.
It is the swiftness of the fall that is interesting here. In another time, a Kardashian scandal would have been limited 
to the inner pages of a newspaper or a magazine. A few lines and a picture of the sisters and that would have fed 
its readers with grumbling material until lunchtime.
If we forget about the legal letters for one minute, it could be argued that, in another time, the Kardashians’ T-shirts 
would have survived on the shelves.
But we live in an era controlled by the merciless influence of social media feeds. Every new Kardashian scandal 
ignites a huge campaign against the enterprising family on Twitter and Facebook. These swirls of negative branding 
ultimately cannot be ignored.
Trial by social media: an open and shut case
The story of brand bashing online is bigger than any Kardashian. Online campaigns against brands have become 
the most influential forces in business, giving customers a public soapbox to call out when corporate ethics are 
lagging and where there are improper company practices.
Ryanair, the low-cost airline, is currently a target for Twitter users complaining about its new seat allocation 
algorithm. Search “#Ryanair” and you’ll find angry posts about families being split up and customers being assigned 
a middle seat when window and aisle seats are free.
“[Three] passengers in back three rows and four rows at front of plane empty, so why me and my mrs in row three 
and 33! #Ryanair ?!” tweeted one aggrieved customer.
Ryanair have denied changing its seat allocation policy, stating that since more passengers are opting to pay for 
seat allocation, if you do not pay you are more likely to be stuck in a middle seat or apart from your 
companion/companions.
The airline has yet to make any changes to the new booking system, but the online outcry has prompted much 
media coverage and an investigation on BBC’s Watchdog.
But the fallout from these campaigns can be more direct. Last month, Travis Kalanick, a founder and chief 
executive of the ride-hailing giant Uber, announced he was stepping down. His resignation came amid a massive 
social media backlash against the company.
The hashtag “#DeleteUber” began after Uber lifted surge pricing when taxi drivers were protesting at New York’s 
John F Kennedy International Airport against Trump’s travel ban. The company had previously been embroiled in 
other controversies – consumer safety issues and allegations of sexism among staff, to name just a few – but this 
was the hashtag that stuck.
Online activism works, which is probably why it is growing. Why march on the Dáil when you can join a campaign 
by tweeting with a hashtag? Then, if you do march, the actual number of you marching makes little difference. As 
long as you have enough angry people holding up a banner in a photo that could be retweeted by hundreds, it is all 
you need.
Companies are losing power. This makes corporate messaging tricky. Step out of line and anti-corporate wrath 
comes down hard and fast. A company’s mistake might even be more nuanced than saying it was a good or bad 
move by that corporation, but those kinds of nuances don’t fit into 140 characters.
The lesson is two-fold: don’t partner with the Kardashians, and beware the new online consumer.

Setback for Ryanair in legal suit against pilots’ association chief

Ryanair has received a blow to its legal action against Evan Cullen, the head of pilots association Ialpa, over 
allegedly defamatory comments made on RTE radio about the airline’s safety policy.
The low-budget carrier had sought to strike out the defences of truth and honest opinion for failing to make 
adequate discovery in the case.
The airline is also suing Ialpa and the trade union Impact for allegedly defamatory comments which arose during an 
interview on RTE Radio 1’s News at One, on August 16, 2012. The comments were later published in the Irish 
edition of the Sunday Times.
In a judgment made last February, but published on the courts website last week, Ms Justice Úna Ní Raifeartaigh 
further refused an order directing the defendants to identify deleted electronic documents which may be 
reconstituted.
In an affidavit sworn by Cullen in 2015, the Ialpa president said that documents received by the union from Ryanair 
pilots who were having issues or disputes with their employer were destroyed or returned.
In reply, Ryanair’s side claimed Cullen’s claims were “not credible”. The airline took issue with his failure to list the 
missing, relevant documents.
In further correspondence, the defendants said the missing records included information about the airline’s 
corporate culture with regard to fuelling procedures.
It was also stated that no documents were destroyed after legal proceedings were initiated.
Cullen said he had been shown records with details of Ryanair pilots who had been disciplined or reprimanded for 
taking on board extra fuel, but he had not been given copies.
Setback for Ryanair in legal suit against pilots’ association chief
Further affidavits from Ialpa stated that very little information was kept about members on its server, following a 
security breach in 2010.
While Ryanair further challenged the methodology adopted during the data search carried out on Ialpa’s server, the 
court found that “bona fide attempts were made to locate both electronic and non-electronic documents” with no 
evidence of “wilful omission or neglect”.
Ní Raifeartaigh found that it would not be necessary to consider the appointment of an independent expert to 
examine the Ialpa database, particularly as the documents in contention appeared to have been hard copies.
She noted that the upcoming trial would be fought on issues such as “what the objective facts are concerning the 
Ryanair policy on aircraft fuel, and whether this policy was safe, as well as whether Mr Cullen had an honest 
opinion based on those facts or whether he was actuated by malice”.

       WASHINGTON (dpa-AFX) - After initially moving higher, stocks have seen some further upside over the course 
of the trading session on Friday. The gains on the day are partly offsetting the losses posted by the major averages 
in the previous session.  Currently, the major averages are just off their highs of the session. The Dow is up 80.78 
points or 0.4 percent at 21,400.82, the Nasdaq is up 59.12 points or 1 percent at 6,148.58 and the S&P 500 is up 
13.30 points or 0.6 percent at 2,423.05.  The rebound on Wall Street comes following the release of a report from 
the Labor Department showing much stronger than expected job growth in the month of June. 
 The report said non-farm payroll employment jumped by 222,000 jobs in June following an upwardly revised 
increase of 152,000 jobs in May.  Economists had expected employment to climb by 179,000 jobs compared to the 
addition of 138,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.  Despite the stronger than expected job growth, 
the unemployment rate inched up to 4.4 percent in June from 4.3 percent in May. Economists had expected the 
unemployment rate to hold steady.  The Labor Department also said average hourly employee earnings rose by 0.2 
percent to $26.25. Average hourly earnings in June were up by 2.5 percent year-over-year.  'This was a strong jobs 
report, with a better-than-expected payroll rise augmented by a solid upward revision,' said Chris Low, chief 
economist at FTN Financial.  He added, 'Still, it should not add to the already considerable fire under the FOMC 
because wage pressures are nowhere to be seen, and labor slack relaxed unexpectedly.'  The Federal Reserve is 
scheduled to make its next decision on interest rates following a two-day meeting later this month.  Sector News  
Airline stocks are seeing considerable strength in mid-day trading, with the NYSE Arca Airline Index climbing by 1.9 
percent. With the gain, the index has reached its best intraday level in over fifteen years.  SkyWest (SKYW), 
Ryanair (RYAAY) and American Airlines (AAL) are turning in some of the sector's best performances on the day.  
Significant strength is also visible among semiconductor stocks, as reflected by the 1.6 percent gain being posted 
by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. The index is climbing further off the nearly two-month closing low set on 
Monday.  Internet, software, and housing stocks are also seeing notable weakness, while gold and energy stocks 
are under pressure amid steep drops by the prices of their associated commodities.  Other Markets  In overseas 
trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei

Raising a racket in Rome

Highlight: A trip to the Italian Tennis Open proves the perfect Roman holiday and a fun alternative for tennis fans 
who can’t make it to Wimbledon, writes Aileen Hickie 
Body
When I told my elderly mother that I was going to the Italian Tennis Open, she wished me the best of luck and said 
she thought I would do very well. She was impressed that, having only taken up tennis through a Rusty Rackets 
programme a few years ago, I was now going to be playing with Venus Williams, Simona Halep and the like in 
Rome’s Foro Italico. I had to disappoint her. I was going to watch. Obviously.
The plan had been hatched over a few glasses of wine between friends in February of this year. Wimbledon, which 
of course everyone is glued to right now, might have seemed the perfect option, but tickets are very expensive and 
difficult to acquire, as is accommodation in London. And it rains.
Instead, Rome in May offered us a high level of competition with all the star players in beautiful surroundings, 
almost guaranteed sun and the absence of family. We figured there might also be a few cocktails served between 
matches, too.
Early planning had its advantages when it came to transportation, accommodation and tickets. The Italian Open 
started on May 10, with the finals taking place on Sunday May 21. We took the advice of other tennis fans who had 
previously been to ATP events (as they are called), and decided to book to watch the better matches in the later 
stages of the tournament, but not the expensive finals themselves. At quarter-final and semi-final stages, you get to 
see some of the biggest names take to the court and play with a real sense of purpose.
We booked our tennis tickets for Friday, May 19 and Saturday, May 20 in the Foro Italico, which meant we would 
get semi-final, centre court action while sitting in the hot Roman sun. These cost us about €250 each including 
service charges. We flew with Ryanair, going into Ciampino Airport (which is about a 30-minute drive into the city) 
on the Thursday evening. The return flights had set us back €122 each (on the Sunday), which we regarded as very 
good value.
Raising a racket in Rome
Next up was accommodation. We wanted a relatively inexpensive hotel in the centre of Rome, within walking 
distance of restaurants and shops, and one that provided something of the authentic Roman atmosphere.
We found the Hotel Piazza di Spagna on the Via Mario de’Fiori and booked two double superior rooms for three 
nights, including breakfast. This cost us €266 per person sharing in total, which we again regarded as reasonable, 
particularly as we didn’t intend spending long indoors. Our rooms were spacious and nicely decorated, if a little 
dark.
One of my travelling companions had the foresight to book dinner in a nearby restaurant for 10pm on the evening of 
our arrival, so after a quick change of clothes we were on our way.
Al 34 was just across the street from our hotel and we were quickly seated at a lovely paveside table, where we 
sipped on carafes of house white wine and hoovered up large plates of fish and pasta. The waiter politely asked us 
to leave after 1am, when all the other diners were long departed. We split the bill and paid the princely sum of €35 
each for a great evening’s dining.
Breakfast in the hotel the following morning was of the continental variety, but there was an abundance of tasty 
boiled eggs and still-warm bread rolls to go along with the delicious coffee, juice, cold meats, cheeses and fruit.
Having paid a quick visit to the Pantheon (so as not to seem like total cultural philistines), we set off for the tennis at 
11am, taking a 30-minute taxi journey. The Foro Italico, on the outskirts of the city, is a sports stadium built by 
Benito Mussolini and regarded as an architectural masterpiece of the Fascist era.
The first match was a treat between Anett Kontaveit and Simona Halep, and from this point it kept getting better. 
We sat in the glorious sunshine watching Alexander Zverev (who went on to win the tournament beating Novak 
Djokovic in the final), Rafael Nadal, Dominic Thiem, Venus Williams, Garbine Muguruza, Juan Martín del Potro and 
Djokovic.
We only managed to drag ourselves away in the mid-afternoon to quaff a few beers and eat a slice of pizza. Former 
British player Annabel Croft, a staple of Wimbledon coverage, sat at a nearby table looking serene while we 
sweated in the 38˚C heat.
Our tickets for the first match on the Saturday were for midday, which gave us the opportunity to do a little light 
shopping before taking the trip to the venue. Again, we had chosen our hotel well, being just minutes from a major 
shopping area which specialised in bright leather handmade bags. But the real ace was a vintage store called 
Lesley on the Via Vittoria: a secondhand clothes shop with luxury labels including Armani, Hermès, Prada and 
more, all with price tags reflecting their gently worn status. For €150, you could pick up beautiful designer trousers 
or shoes. The handbags were pricier, but a bargain nonetheless.
Once again, we spent the rest of the day watching the tennis in the Campo Centrale where we were awed by the 
play in the men’s semi-final between Zverev and John Isner. We were further wowed by Muguruza and Svitolina in 
the women’s semi-final, though it was a little disappointing when Muguruza retired injured. I was particularly 
downhearted, as I had decided to wear my own white tennis skirt for the day in case any player had to withdraw 
injured and I was called on to substitute. But they didn’t seem to need me.
It was close to 9pm when we returned to the hotel. Our planning had not extended to booking a restaurant for that 
evening, as we had thought we might do something spontaneous. This was a mistake: we were turned away from 
restaurant after restaurant. It was now well after 10pm and I would have eaten my own liver.
Turning a corner down a small street, we found a Mexican nightclub that also served food. We were thrilled to be 
given a table and happily ordered buckets of margaritas, large plates of nachos and enchiladas. We stayed until 
2am, knowing we had an early flight the following morning.
For tennis fans, it was the perfect Roman holiday. ■
Raising a racket in Rome
Marathon: it might seem a little extreme to train and run 26.2 miles for the sake of a little mini break. But I have 
done this three times now, and enjoyed marathon holidays in New York and London with a run thrown in. Berlin 
beckons in September, and Sports Travel International is just one company which offers the entire package of 
marathon entry, accommodation and flights.
Tennis: residential tennis holidays are also a booming business with coaching teams and tennis programmes being 
offered in four and five-star locations from the Algarve to Tenerife, Sardinia, Spain and Cyprus. Annabel Croft 
Tennis Holidays offers great packages to these destinations.
Yoga: my sister and her friends regularly rave about the benefits of a yoga retreat. Thailand seems to be the 
destination of choice for these yoga holidays, which can be booked for five days or more and often have a detox or 
weight-loss element to them too.
Cycling: cycling holidays are hugely popular at the moment, both in Ireland and abroad. You can choose from 
mountain biking in Spain, leisure cycling in Sardinia, pleasure cycling in Italy and road cycling in Andalucia. I’m not 
sure what the difference between leisure and pleasure cycling is, but it may have something to do with the size of 
the hills you have to climb.

a.m. EDT — The Manchester Airport issued a statement Wednesday updating passengers about the evacuation at 
Terminal 3. "Manchester Airport can confirm that our routine hold baggage screening process in Terminal 3 
identified a bag which appeared to contain suspicious item. Greater Manchester Police was immediately informed 
and all passengers were safely evacuated from the terminal while further investigations took place," authorities said 
in the statement.[1] "Officers have now determined the bad poses no threat and we are beginning to process of 
allowing colleagues and passengers back into the terminal." 
"We apologize to all passengers affected by this incident. The safety and security of our customers and employees 
will always be our number one priority. We encourage all passengers due to travel from Terminal 3 to contact their 
airline for updates." Original Story Manchester Airport's Terminal 3 was evacuated Wednesday after a "suspicious 
package" was found in the area. The airport said on its Twitter account the evacuation was only at one terminal and 
passengers were being sent to other terminals to board their planes. A bomb disposal unit arrived at the scene after 
police was alerted about the incident linked to a "potential issue with a bag." People at the airport posted photos of 
passengers waiting at the tarmac as authorities conducted the precautionary evacuation. In a statement, the airport 
said six Ryanair flights were diverted to Terminal 2, while the rest of the passengers were advised to use Terminal 
1 for their travel. The airport also said that plane's due to arrive at Terminal 3 are heading to the other two 
terminals.https://twitter.com/manairport/status/882544358574231553'Police were called at 8.50am on Wednesday 
5 July 2017 to reports of a suspicious package at Manchester Airport. Officers are responding and a precautionary 
evacuation of terminal three has taken place. Bomb disposal officers attended and a series of controlled explosions 
were carried out of the package," the Greater Manchester Police said. 'Enquiries are ongoing.' University lecturer 
Lizabeth Hannaford, who was among those evacuated, tweeted that police were expanding the security cordon and 
moving people further away from the terminal. Here are some photos and reactions posted on social media.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Tuesday.----------COMPANIES----------Worldpay Group said it has 
received preliminary takeover approaches from both payment services provider Vantiv and financial services firm 
JPMorgan Chase Bank. The FTSE 100-listed payment processing firm noted a recent movement in its share price 
resulting from press speculation surrounding a takeover approach. "There can be no certainty either that an offer 
will be made nor as to the terms of any offer, if made," Worldpay said in a statement. Each of Vantiv and JP Morgan 
have a deadline of August 1 to confirm if they wish to make an offer for Worldpay. 
----------J Sainsbury reported growth in sales in the first quarter of its financial year as it continued launching new 
products, and said it is "well-placed to navigate the external environment". The supermarket chain said retail sales 
in the 16 weeks ended July 1 grew by 2.7% year-on-year, excluding fuel, while like-for-like sales rose by 2.3%, also 
excluding fuel. Grocery sales increased by 3.0% on the back of a 1.9% rise in transaction growth, which 
Sainsbury's said was thanks to "strong" food sales where it has invested in product innovation, such as its new 
Summer eating ranges.----------Oil field services firm Hunting said it expects to report a loss for the first half of 2017, 
due to low oil prices leading to continued weak US offshore and international drilling markets. Hunting said although 
it has benefited from an increase in onshore drilling in the US, its Well Construction and Well Intervention segments 
continue to see difficult market conditions. The firm said its outlook for the remainder of 2017 is predicated on 
"sustained US onshore drilling activity" driving trading, along with "cautious optimism for stable offshore and 
international markets". ----------Budget airlines Ryanair Holdings and Wizz Air Holdings reported growth in both the 
number of passengers carried and load factor in June year-on-year. Irish carrier Ryanair said it carried 12% more 
passengers in June to 11.8 million from 10.6 million a year earlier, as load factor increased by 2 percentage points 
to 96% from 94%. On a rolling annual basis, traffic grew by 13% to 123.8 million passengers. Central and Eastern 
European-focused airline Wizz Air said it flew 24% more customers in June to 2.5 million from 2.0 million a year 
earlier, as load factor rose by 0.6 percentage point to 92.3% from 91.7%.----------MARKETS----------London shares 
were lower mid-morning as payments processor Worldpay led the blue-chip risers. The pound was slightly lower 
against the dollar as data showed UK construction sector growth eased more than forecast in June. Markets in the

A total of 72 new commercial aircraft orders during May were offset by 24 cancellations and 30 swaps, according to 
preliminary figures from Flight Fleets Analyzer. The new order total was split between Airbus, with 59 sales, and 
Boeing, with 13.
The net figure of 48 aircraft ordered in May represents a 74% decrease on the same month during 2016, when 
Fleets Analyzer shows a net 184 units ordered.
NARROWBODY FOCUS
Of the new orders received, narrowbody commitments dominated, at 42 aircraft. These were predominantly for 
A320-family jets, with Airbus logging 39 orders for the type, including 34 Neo-model examples.
Customers included Delta Air Lines, which ordered 30 more A321s, increasing its firm on-order total for the aircraft 
to 112. The jets will be powered by CFM International CFM56 engines. Unannounced buyers accounted for an 
additional nine A320-family twinjets, while European low-cost carrier EasyJet switched 30 of its orders for 
A320neos to the larger A321neo, to be delivered from mid-2018.
The remaining three narrowbody orders were for Boeing 737s.
At the end of May, the overall aircraft order backlog stood at 14,363: down 100 on the previous month.
Fleets Analyzer shows that 143 commercial aircraft were delivered in May, down 8% on the same month in 2016. 
This total was split between narrowbody and widebody types at 84 and 33 units, respectively, followed by 
17 regional jet shipments and nine turboprops delivered.
Sales slump asAsia closes gap Our monthly summary of commercial aircraft orders shows modest successes 
in May, when Airbus and Boeing shared the spoils. Meanwhi....
Customers in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe took delivery of 47 and 41 units, respectively, while mainline and 
low-cost operators accounted for 62 and 42 of the shipments, respectively.
Airbus delivered 46 A320-family aircraft – including 13 Neo examples, while Boeing shipped 33 737NGs and the 
first 737 Max.
Ryanair took the most aircraft of any airline during May, receiving seven 737s at a rate which has been sustained 
since the start of this year to support its rapid expansion. American Airlines received four aircraft: two A321s and 
two 737s; while Batik Air, Norwegian and VietJet Air each took delivery of two aircraft.
The figure of 33 widebody shipments matched the total seen in the same month last year, with Boeing having 
delivered 20 and Airbus 13. Saudia was the largest recipient for the month, taking single examples of the A330, 777 
and 787.
In the regional sector, Skywest Airlines took delivery of four Embraer 175s, while Iran Air received the same number 
of ATR 72-600s: the first of 20 that it is taking under a deal sealed in April.
FLEET GROWTH
Meanwhile, Fleets Analyzer shows that the in-service commercial fleet in May totalled more than 25,500 passenger 
aircraft and more than 2,300 used for freight operations.
The in-service narrowbody fleet exceeded 15,150 units, up slightly from April and accounting for more than half of 
all commercial aircraft. The active fleet in the growing Asia-Pacific market is now only 240 units behind the current 
largest market, North America.
74%
May’s net commercial aircraft order total of 48 units marked a major fall from the 184 recorded by Flight Fleets 
Analyzer during the same month one year earlier
Delta was the big buyer for the month, ordering 30 more A321s

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. shares were slightly lower on Tuesday as oil and mining 
stocks succumbed to profit taking after sharp gains the previous day.    An upbeat sales update from supermarket 
chain J Sainsbury and news of takeover approach from Vantiv for payments processing firm Worldpay helped to 
limit overall losses to some extent.   The benchmark FTSE 100 was down 15 points or 0.20 percent at 7,362 in late 
opening deals after rising 0.9 percent in the previous session.   Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, BP Plc 
and Glencore fell between half a percent and 1.1 percent.   Worldpay shares soared as much as 21 percent after 
the company said it had received preliminary approaches from Vantiv Inc and JPMorgan Chase Bank for a potential 
deal.   Sainsbury rose about 1 percent. The supermarket group reported a 2.3 percent rise in same-store sales for 
the first quarter.   Discount airline Ryanair Holdings rose half a percent on reporting a 12 percent rise in passenger 
traffic in June from a year earlier.   Semiconductor designer Imagination Technologies soared 6 percent after it 
swung to a full-year pretax profit with a clear strategy for growth.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary is “very tempted” to order the Boeing 737 Max 10, but only when the “price 
is right”.
Talks with Boeing over a potential order are under way, “but we haven’t reached an agreement on pricing yet”, he 
says.
Speaking at the Future Travel Experience conference in Dublin on 26 June, O’Leary added that the “obvious 
attraction” of the new variant was its 30 extra seats over the carrier’s ordered 200-seat 737 Max 8 200s.
But he stresses that Ryanair would only buy the type at a price that allows it to continue reducing airfares.
O’Leary sees a risk that the Max 10 could add “complexity” to operations by requiring Ryanair to take on extra crew, 
and extra seats would mean a “big further yield dilution”. He rules out converting any existing Ryanair orders for the 
Max 8. “I get eight seats more per aircraft, 4% more revenue, without any more cabin crew and pilots,” says 
O’Leary of the Max 8.

Ryanair could increase share buybacks to comply with European Union ownership laws when Britain leaves the 
EU, according to the Irish carrier's chief executive officer.
"Ownership post Brexit is a real issue," Michael O'Leary was quoted as saying by London South East at a hearing 
in the European Parliament. "It might help me to accelerate the share buyback if UK shareholders are forced to 
sell."
According to O'Leary about 20% of Ryanair's shareholders are UK-based. The carrier has already been carrying 
out share buybacks to return cash to shareholders.
To qualify as a European carrier airlines have to be majority owned by European investors. Ryanair was 53.6% 
owned by EU nationals, including UK investors in 2016, according to the airline.
O'Leary reiterated that unless a deal is agreed for Brexit then flights between Britain and the remaining European 
Union countries could be grounded.
"There is not a legal mechanism on which airlines can operate in a 'hard Brexit, no deal' outcome. There will simply 
be no flights," he said, adding that Ryanair would start cancelling flights six months before the March 2019 date 
when Britain is due to leave the EU - with or without a deal.
Aviation is not covered by World Trade Organisation rules, which would apply to other industries should Britain fail 
to agree a deal by March 2019.

Easyjet Europe to be headquartered in Vienna

British low-cost carrier (LCC) Easyjet intends to base its European headquarters in Austria in order to avoid any 
disruption to its intra-European Union services when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.
The LCC has applied to Austro Control for an air operator certificate (AOC) and to Austria's transport ministry for an 
airline operating licence.
Once these are received the company will establish a new airline, Easyjet Europe, and headquarter it in Vienna.
The new arrangement should mean that Easyjet can continue flights between European Union destinations once 
Britain leaves the European Union.
To do so an airline must be majority owned and effectively controlled by European Union shareholders, conditions 
that Easyjet promises to meet.
“The new structure means that easyJet would become a pan European airline group with three airlines based in 
Austria, Switzerland and the UK. All of these will be owned by easyJet plc which itself will be European Union-
owned and controlled,” Easyjet says in a statement.
In June the European Commission published guidance about ownership and control rules, which it said should look 
at an airline’s corporate governance and “where” strategic business decision are taken.
Easyjet says that its Austrian accreditation processes are “well underway” and that its AOC and licence should 
materialise in the “near future”.
However, flights from Easyjet’s main bases in London to Europe still have a cloud hanging over them.
Michael O’Leary, boss of Ryanair, Easyjet’s Dublin-based rival, told the European Parliament this week that Brexit 
could mean a temporary cessation of all flights between the UK and Europe.
“Easyjet will continue to push for the UK and EU to reach an aviation agreement which, at a minimum, will enable 
flights between the UK and EU,” says Easyjet.

Ryanair adds capacity but restates Brexit aircraft warning

Ryanair took delivery of 14 new aircraft in the quarter to 30 June and subsequently has agreed several lease 
extensions.
The carrier indicates in a first-quarter earnings release it added 14 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft and continues to 
see “significant growth opportunities” across Europe as legacy airlines restructure and other competitors close 
bases or move capacity.
The low-cost airline ended the quarter with 397 737units.
It topped up its orderbook in June with 10 more 737 Max 200s. Five of these will be delivered in 2019 and five more 
in 2020.
In addition, it recently agreed extensions of 10 operating leases that will provide three additional aircraft in 2018 and 
10 more in 2019.
“This addresses a temporary capacity shortage before our Boeing Max deliveries accelerate in September 2019 
and allows us to maintain consistent growth through FY20,” says Ryanair.
The carrier says it remains “concerned at the uncertainty which surrounds the terms of the UK’s departure from the 
EU” in March 2019.
“While we continue to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU Open Skies agreement, we caution that should the 
UK leave, there may not be sufficient time, or goodwill on both sides, to negotiate a timely replacement bilateral 
which could result in a disruption of flights between the UK and Europe for a period of time from April 2019 
onwards,” it adds.
If there is no certainty about the legal basis for the operation of flights between the UK and the European Union by 
autumn 2018, Ryanair “may be forced to cancel flights and move some, or all, of our UK based aircraft to 
Continental Europe from April 2019 onwards”.
Ryanair’s net profit jumped 55% for the first quarter of its 2018 financial year, with the post-tax figure increasing to 
&euro;397 million ($453 million), compared with &euro;256 million a year ago.
Ryanair adds capacity but restates Brexit aircraft warning
Revenue totalled &euro;1.9 billion, up 13% year over year.
Passenger numbers for the quarter rose 12% to 35 million. Load factor climbed two percentage points to 96%, 
compared with the same period last year.
In May the Ryanair board approved a &euro;600 million ordinary share buyback programme. In the first quarter, it 
spent &euro;165 million under this buyback at an average price of &euro;18.20.
It also purchased &euro;39 million worth of American Depositary Receipts (ADR) under the &euro;150 million 
“Evergreen” ADR buyback programme launched last February. Despite this cumulative spend of over &euro;200 
million on buybacks and capex of almost &euro;400 million in the quarter, it reduced net debt by &euro;150 million 
to &euro;94 million at 30 June, from &euro;244 million at 31 March.
Ryanair is raising its fiscal year 2018 traffic target to 131 million, up one million on its previous guidance. Ex-fuel 
unit costs are on track to deliver a 1% reduction this year, and fuel hedging should deliver savings of approximately 
&euro;70 million, when adjusted for volume growth.
However, the carrier warns that the guidance remains heavily dependent on “close-in summer bookings, the 
absence of any further security events, ATC strikes or negative Brexit developments".

Hard Brexit will stop UK-EU flights: Ryanair boss

Ryanair's chief executive officer Michael O’Leary has told the European Parliament that flights between the UK and 
Europe could halt for a period after Britain leaves the European Union (EU).
For services to continue uninterrupted either Britain would have to remain a member of the single aviation market, 
over which the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has jurisdiction, or agree a new bilateral air treaty with the EU.
A ‘hard brexit’ – in which the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal or with one that sees it lose most of the benefits 
of single market and customs union membership – would probably preclude both of those options, thus halting 
flights.
O’Leary pointed out that current UK Brexit policy, such as one existed, sought the removal of ECJ oversight. He 
also thought it very unlikely that the UK and EU could negotiate a new bilateral treaty before 31 March 2019, when 
Britain is scheduled to officially leave the EU.
“There isn’t a mechanism to do a deal. No-one in the UK government has a clue how to do a deal; they don’t even 
know what it is the hell they want,” O’Leary told MEPs.
As a result, Ryanair will start shifting aircraft from the UK to European regional airports from April 2019.
However, O’Leary also predicted that the UK government would be “forced to come to its senses” and do a deal 
soon after, meaning that any disruption to flights would probably last for about eight weeks.
“After a couple of months the British public will understand that they don’t all want to go on holiday in Scotland or 
Ireland,” he said.
O’Leary described Brexit as “one of the great economic suicide notes in history”.

Ryanair would seek a majority stake in Alitalia if it decides to invest in the loss-making Italian airline, its chief 
executive said during a visit to Rome on Tuesday.
Alitalia filed in May to be put under special administration for the second time in less than a decade, starting a 
process that will lead to the airline being overhauled, sold off or wound up.
"In case of an acquisition, we would be interested in a majority stake, not a minority one," Ryanair CEO Michael 
O'Leary told journalists during a news conference in Rome. "We are not interested in a 49% stake."
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, had already expressed an interest in Alitalia, but 
previously stressed it was keen on cooperating with the business rather than buying it.
Ryanair had also said it wanted to provide short-haul traffic to feed Alitalia's long-haul network and offered to deploy 
aircraft this summer if the Italian carrier cut capacity significantly.
However, on Tuesday O'Leary said Ryanair would consider a bid for the entire airline once it was restructured by 
the administrators.
More than 30 parties have expressed an interest in Alitalia, although local media said none of the offers were for the 
entire airline but only for specific assets such as planes or airport slots.
The commissioners have now given selected parties access to Alitalia's books, with non-binding offers due by July 
21.
Ryanair would want majority stake if opts to bid for Alitalia
The government has repeatedly said it would prefer to sell the airline in one block, partly to minimize the impact on 
its 12,500 staff. It has ruled out re-nationalizing Alitalia.
Whereas Etihad Airways, which came to Alitalia's rescue in 2014, was bound by European rules that limit 
ownership by groups from outside the EU to 49%, Dublin-based Ryanair would be free to buy a bigger stake.
Without a majority stake, Etihad's influence was limited despite being the largest single investor and the lack of full 
control meant it could not deal with labor and other problems effectively.
Ryanair already has a strong presence in Italy.
The airline expects its Italian passengers to rise to 36 million this year, O'Leary said. Official traffic data put the total 
at 32.6 million last year. (Reuters)

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary is "very tempted" to order the Boeing 737 Max 10, but only when the "price 
is right", he tells FlightGlobal.
Discussions with Boeing over a potential order are under way "but we haven't reached an agreement on pricing 
yet", says O'Leary.
The Ryanair chief, who was speaking to FlightGlobal at the Future Travel Experience conference in Dublin on 26 
June, added that the "obvious attraction" of the new variant – launched at this year's Paris air show – was its 30 
extra seats.
But he stresses that Ryanair would only buy the variant at a price that allows it to continue reducing airfares.
O'Leary sees a risk that the Max 10 could add "complexity" to Ryanair's operations by requiring the budget carrier 
to take on extra crew members, and says the additional seats would mean a "big further yield dilution to what are 
already the lowest airfares in Europe".
He rules out converting any of Ryanair's existing orders for the Max 8, which represents "the ultimate sweet spot" 
for the carrier. "I get eight seats more per aircraft, 4% more revenue, without any more cabin crew and pilots," says 
O'Leary of the Max 8.
Ryanair ordered 10 additional Max 8s during the Paris air show. This, says O'Leary, was a result of Boeing bringing 
production of the type forward, "which is where they got the extra slots from".
Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that Ryanair has 110 Max 8s and 65 737-800s on order.

Swedish business bosses are known for being careful with their words, some might even say dull. Sebastian 
Siemiatkowski is different.
It might be his tech background or his age, he is 35, but the chief executive of Klarna is not afraid to speak his mind. 
Announcing this week that his company had become the biggest fintech in Europe to receive a banking licence , he 
said he wanted Klarna to become the "Ryanair" of the sector and attack the high-voltage incumbents.
"Ryanair has pretty bad customer service," sniffed one senior Swedish banker. But in the next breath, she added: 
"That's to take nothing away from Klarna. What Sebastian has achieved there is remarkable."
Mr Siemiatkowski and two university friends took a deceptively simple idea on invoicing and applied it to the digital 
age. The result is an online payments system that is simpler for customers and better for merchants, with fewer 
dropped transactions caused by people balking at filling in too much information. Instead, customers pay for online 
goods after they receive them, and Klarna takes the credit risk from sellers in return for a cut.
Entered 12 years ago in an entrepreneur competition at Sweden's leading business school, the idea was rejected 
by many of the country's top executives. The desire to prove them wrong still motivates Mr Siemiatkowski. "For me

Siemiatkowski, Chief executive, Klarna
personally, it's a day I've been looking forward to for a long time," he said of Monday's decision by Swedish 
regulators to give Klarna a banking licence.
Mr Siemiatkowski has also long stood out in Sweden as one of the few business people willing to give his opinions 
about politics. After national elections that saw a breakthrough for the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, he told 
the Financial Times: "We believe that Sweden becomes a much better place because people from all over the 
world are working here. Seeing the Sweden Democrats growing feels like taking the country back 100 years ago."
That impatience with the traditional ways of doing things has led to Klarna becoming one of the most highly valued 
technology groups in Europe. A round of fundraising in 2015 valued it at $2.25bn. And it is solidly profitable, making 
an operating profit of SKr138m ($16m) in the first quarter on revenues of SKr992m.
Klarna's ambitions go way beyond increasing profits. Mr Siemiatkowski talks about how the financial industry is 
unusual for being a sector still dominated by national players, offering a broad range of services. His vision instead 
is of a group of global players offering specialised services.
So Klarna will use its banking licence to offer bank cards and salary accounts to its 60m users. But it will not offer 
mortgages, savings products or share dealing. Instead, Mr Siemiatkowski expects other fintechs to do that, with the 
possibility of several teaming up loosely to provide the full offering.
Its large userbase, mostly in Germany and the Nordics, means he thinks he can get around one big problem for 
fintechs of being largely unknown to the public, who hesitate to trust them. "We are still moving at the speed of a 
fintech, but provide the trust and security of a bank. That makes us a super rare animal."
The big goal for Klarna, however, is trying to crack the US and UK markets. Some wonder whether Mr 
Siemiatkowski has bitten off more than he can chew by becoming a bank.
"Online payments is one thing. But being a bank you end up being heavily regulated. I wonder if they can cope with 
that," says a top Swedish banker.
Mr Siemiatkowski is not worried. He says: "Companies are cool, but banks are cooler. Building a bank is even 
cooler." Richard Milne

Belfast betting on a bright future in wake of Brexit
Belfast betting on a bright future in wake of Brexit
Sunday Business Post

Length: 1017 words
Byline: Graham Clifford
Highlight: A building boom, increased consumer confidence and optimism that the city can benefit from businesses 
relocating after Brexit have all given Belfast the belief that better days are on their way, writes Graham Clifford 
Body
Stand at any elevated vantage point in Belfast city centre, and the sight of cranes dotting the skyline indicates just 
how vibrant the city’s economy has become.
Despite political volatility and economic uncertainty, the city is looking towards a bright, positive and peaceful future. 
It’s on the cusp of something big and consumer confidence remains encouragingly high.
Busy shopping malls, museums, lively pubs, clubs and hotels, active streets full of colour and world class third- 
level institutions create a rich tapestry.
The business sector, and in particular technology, is strengthening as new job announcements become a near-
monthly reality and companies already located in Belfast and across Northern Ireland continue to re-invest.
And technology isn’t the only sector which can claim great success in recent years. Take, for example, the hotel 
sector. It is estimated there are almost 30 new hotel projects in the offing across the North with the bulk of the 
building boom in Belfast. The city will see an unprecedented rise of 38 per cent in room capacity by 2018 if all 
current projects come to fruition. This could grow by a further 35 per cent by 2020. In terms of investment, the 
private sector will spend around £300 million building these new hotels by 2018.
One of the clearest indicators that Belfast is fast developing a reputation as a business, retail and tourist hotspot is 
the fact that the Belfast International to London Gatwick route became the busiest British domestic air route in 2016.
The Belfast to Gatwick service operated by EasyJet and Ryanair overtook the Edinburgh-Heathrow link to become 
Britain’s most popular domestic route, while Belfast International has overtaken Gatwick to become Britain’s fourth 
largest airport for domestic operations.
Belfast betting on a bright future in wake of Brexit
Two new trans-Atlantic services from Belfast to New York and Boston will help boost long-haul passenger numbers 
and attract great numbers of American tourists to the North.
Belfast is just 90 minutes from Dublin by road, and with a new multimillion-pound transport hub in the pipeline, 
connectivity between Belfast and the Republic will be further improved.
All of these factors make Belfast an ideal location for businesses seeking to establish a satellite office within the 
British market, according to Johnny Hanna, partner and head of tax at KPMG in Northern Ireland.
He told The Sunday Business Post: “In Brexit-related discussions with various companies we emphasise the need 
to prepare based on what is known at this stage.
“It makes common sense to consider all scenarios – in particular the British government’s stated intention to leave 
both the single market and the customs union. With that in mind we recommend focusing on the business 
implications and to think about what actions they can take to ensure that their business is prepared. For example, 
what are the supply chain implications? Do you know where your inputs are coming from and what the implications 
might be under various scenarios?”
Hanna continued: “While Brexit has the potential to cause significant disruption to many British and EU supply 
chains, one obvious response from EU companies (including those from Ireland) currently selling into the British 
market may be to simply establish a British base (eg, a manufacturing operation or a warehouse) so as to minimise 
any issues that might arise from a new EU/British customs border. There is undoubtedly a huge opportunity here for 
Belfast (and Northern Ireland generally) to attract some of this business.”
A key asset for businesses in the city is the availability of a rich talent pool fed by Queen’s University and Ulster 
University and a strong network of further education colleges. A cost competitive workforce and low labour turnover 
make the North an attractive location for inward investors.
In March, the US fintech firm Vela said that the North’s rich talent pool of graduates and professionals was a key 
driver for its long-term commitment to the region. “Their knowledge and skill, strong work ethic, and can-do attitude 
have helped us to remain true to our key values of teamwork, technology excellence, efficiency, focus, integrity, and 
reliability,” said chief executive Jen Nayar as she announced an increase in jobs at the company’s Belfast base.
The fact that almost 80 per cent of new inward investors have already reinvested in the North, or are planning to 
invest more, shows the North’s excellent track record as a location for investment.
Meanwhile, projects such as the £175 million Belfast Transport Hub development, which will include new 
commercial, retail and residential space in the city, will add even more vibrancy to an already buzzing city. The new 
hub will include eight railway platforms – allowing an hourly service to and from Dublin while moving the Enterprise 
rail service from Central Station.
The surrounding Weavers Cross neighbourhood offers huge investment potential allowing for over 100,000 sq m of 
commercial space alongside significant residential and amenity space. ‘Regeneration through reconnection’ is a key 
them of the project – bringing together the area’s past, regenerating its present and reimagining its future.
Hanna of KPMG said: “Resilience should not be underestimated, and Belfast has bags of that. The city has 
developed a reputation for getting on with things even when obstacles are placed in its path. It has developed a 
very strong record in attracting foreign direct investment, maintaining a competitive cost base, developing the 
adequate talent and infrastructure and Belfast is now a well-connected city.”
Hanna also emphasised the personal tax environment. “The personal tax regime is attractive and if the corporation 
tax rate is reduced to 12.5 per cent soon that will certainly assist the economy in Northern Ireland. Heads are being 
turned and international investors are looking to Belfast more now than ever before. The city needs to capitalise on 
this great opportunity.”
Belfast betting on a bright future in wake of Brexit
Buoyant, booming and agile, Belfast is well placed to build on the successes of recent years as it strives to expand, 
grow and boost inward investment.

 Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it has ordered an additional 10 Airbus A321ceo aircraft, to join its fleet 
in 2018 and 2019.
Based on current list prices, the value of the new order is USD1.2 billion, although Wizz Air noted that Airbus has 
granted it "significant" discounts from list prices in the past.
Wizz Air has been operating the Airbus A321 since November 2015 and currently operates 19 of the 230-seat 
aircraft type with another 22 A321 aircraft to join the fleet by 2019. 
Wizz Air said it is achieving 10% unit cost savings with the A321 when compared to the A320.
The airline added that the new order, on top of the 110 A321neo aircraft it has ordered, will more than double the 
size of its fleet by 2024.
Shares in Wizz Air were trading up 0.2% at 2,315.00 pence on Wednesday.
The announcement came after rival budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said it has bought a further 10 
Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft. 
The new order, valued at more than USD1.1 billion, adds to an existing order for 100 of the same aircraft. Ryanair 
said the total 110 aircraft will allow it to grow its traffic to 200 million customers per year by 2024.

PARIS (AP) - The Latest on the Paris Air Show (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
Boeing has landed a string of new plane deals while Airbus has won lucrative promises at the Paris Air Show, as 
both plane makers stressed the growing importance of digital technology in aviation.
Boeing announced firm orders Tuesday for more than 45 planes worth $5.4 billion at list prices, though customers 
routinely negotiate discounts. Buyers included Ryanair, China's Okay Airways and the Aviation Capital Group 
leasing company.
Boeing also took in tentative orders for a further 83 planes worth as much as $9.3 billion.
Airbus said it had pledges Tuesday for 95 jets worth up to $10.4 billion at list prices.
Most of the orders were for single-aisle jets.
Airbus launched a new digital platform and Boeing forecast big growth in demand for technology and data to guide 
aviation industry decisions.
High-tech hardware is getting attention at this year's Paris Air Show.
___
2:20 p.m.
The head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration says the boom in drone popularity is "a huge game changer" 
similar "to powered flight or jet engines."
In an Associated Press interview Tuesday, Michael Huerta said "the growth of this industry and how it's evolving is 
something that all of us in aviation need to pay a lot of attention to."
The Latest: Boeing , Airbus compete for orders at air show
Huerta spoke on the sidelines of the Paris Air Show, where drones of all kinds were being displayed.
For the industry, their popularity begs a vital question: how do you make sure that swarms of new machines don't 
endanger each other, other users of the skies and people on the ground as they do everything from patrolling traffic 
blackspots to, possibly, delivering your burger and fries?

Klarna aims to be Ryanair of banking as fintech group wins lender's licence
Klarna aims to be Ryanair of banking as fintech group wins lender's licence

Klarna has become the largest European fintech company to secure a banking licence, with the Swedish group 
saying it wants to become a Ryanair-type low-cost disrupter of the sector, attacking established lenders across the 
continent.
Valued at more than $2bn, Klarna has captured much of the market for online payments in the Nordic countries and 
Germany. Yesterday it received a banking licence from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, 20 months 
after filing for one.
"We want to be part of reshaping the retail banking industry. New regulations ... set the right prerequisites for the 
destruction of that industry, but it needs a Ryanair to come along. We want to be that player," Sebastian 
Siemiatkowski, Klarna's chief executive, told the Financial Times.
Fintech groups in Europe and the US, such as SoFi and Zopa, have been seeking full banking licences, but Klarna - 
with its 60m customers across Europe and (EURO)13bn in transactions processed last year - is one of the largest.
The Swedish group, which is profitable, had revenues of SKr3.6bn ($410m) last year and was valued at $2.25bn in 
a fundraising in 2015. It is looking at offering European customers services such as bank cards and salary 
accounts, as well as eyeing the US for expansion.
Klarna aims to be Ryanair of banking as fintech group wins lender's licence
Mr Siemiatkowski thinks banks offer poor customer service at inflated prices. "Banks are challenged. In the tech 
world, these companies get outcompeted very quickly if they don't deliver. But due to regulation, banks with very old 
technology - and poor customer satisfaction - have been able to prevail," he said.
Chris Ward of Mapa Research, a digital banking consultancy, said that despite Klarna being "quite aggressive" in its 
approach, the big universal banks were likely to resist the challenge.
"Fintechs are not going to break down your big incumbent banks. Those banks are always going to maintain a 
certain size, giving them big economies of scale," he said.

 Societe Generale reiterated its Buy rating on Wizz Air Holdings, saying the central and eastern European airline 
could come close to challenging Irish peer Ryanair Holdings as the number one low-cost carrier in Europe. 
The French bank also raised its price target to 2,800 pence from 1,860p. Shares were up 0.8% at 2,315.00p on 
Monday. 
SocGen analysts Michael Kuhn and Sumit Mehrotra said Wizz Air has taken the fast track to developing a 
successful low-cost platform in Eastern Europe. It is the only low-cost carrier with unit costs that come close to 
competitor Ryanair's, making it one of two European ultra budget airlines. 
Kuhn and Mehrotra also pointed out that only 13 years after its first flight, Wizz Air is already generating industry-
leading margins, with significant economies of scale in Eastern and Western Europe yet to be generated.
The analysts said Wizz Air holds a market leading position in most central and eastern European countries.
"Wizz Air's origin and most important market is the CEE region, where GDP is growing nicely and which still offers 
significant growth potential. Several of its western European markets remain under-penetrated on low-cost aviation 
too," Kuhn and Mehrotra noted. 
With a much smaller fleet of around 80 aircraft, when compared to Ryanair's 380 and easyJet's 270, Wizz Air has 
become the second ultra low-cost carrier besides Ryanair in Europe.
As such, the pair argued that Wizz Air could become Ryanair's toughest competitor.
"Wizz Air still trades at a (justifiable) discount to its key peer Ryanair, as it lacks a long-term track record and it is 
much smaller. However, we expect Wizz Air to perform well and the fleet is set to grow fast, which should gradually 
dissolve the discount," the analysts said.

The 737 Max 9 on show at Paris is the first of two aircraft which will undertake the flight-test programme for the 
larger Max variant.
Boeing completed certification of the baseline Max 8 variant earlier this year and the aircraft is now in revenue 
service with Malindo Air. The Max 9 is the second variant of the CFM International Leap-1B-powered family, flight-
testing of which began on 13 April.
"We brought 1D001 – the very first 737 Max 9 – to the show," says Keith Leverkuhn, Boeing's vice-president and 
general manger of the 737 programme. "This is going to be the workhorse of our Max 9 fleet."
The first 737 Max 9 is on display at Paris
Max Kingsley-Jones/FlightGlobal
Leverkuhn says the second aircraft will join the test effort "later in the summer".
Flight-testing is progressing well, he says, with the initial flutter and much of the airworthiness work completed on 
the first aircraft. "When we finish up at Paris we'll take it back to Seattle and finish that work."
Ed Wilson, chief pilot on the 737 Max programme, flew the 737 Max 9 to Le Bourget, with stops in Goose Bay, 
Canada, and Stansted airport in the UK, where it was presented to Ryanair, which is a customer for the 737 Max 
200.
He is full of praise for the way the Max 9 flies which, he says “is just like any other 737”. He adds: “I flew my first 
737 10 years ago and it flies pretty much like that one.”
E PARIS: 737 Max 9 testing on course for Q1 2018 certification The 737 Max 9 on show at Paris is the first of 
two aircraft which will undertake the flight-test ....
Boeing is close to securing the type inspection authorisation for the Max 9, which will allow certification work to 
begin with the US Federal Aviation Administration.
Testing through the remainder of 2017 will focus on areas such as "performance, stability control and autoland – 
those things associated with the longer body of the Max 9", says Leverkuhn. "We expect to finish up flight-testing in 
2017, certify in the first quarter and deliver shortly after."
Boeing has not yet disclosed who will be the launch operator of the 737 Max 9.

Ryanair's outspoken chief executive, Michael O'Leary, sold 4m shares in the budget airline worth a total of 
(EURO)72m (£63.5m) on June 6. At (EURO)18 a share, the chief executive sold at just under Ryanair's all-time 
share price high of (EURO)18.26 reached on May 31 this year.
Mr O'Leary is still the thirdlargest Ryanair shareholder, behind Fidelity Investments and HSBC, owning close to 4 
per cent of shares after this disposal.
Last month, the airline announced a (EURO)600m share buyback programme, but warned there could be 
"significant disruption" to flights between the UK and Europe after the UK leaves the EU. In light of this, Ryanair has 
started to shift its strategy from UK-bound flights to focus on routes in Europe, despite Mr O'Leary's claims that the 
airline would stop flying to the continent if the aviation? industry was not given a post-Brexit deal. Julia Faurschou

Highlight: Leading discount carriers have warned that a flights crisis still looms under uncertain the Brexit cloud, 
writes Cristopher Jasper 
Body
The British government’s possible shift to a softer position on Brexit that would prioritise the economy over 
immigration curbs has failed to assuage concerns at Ryanair and EasyJet about the impact of the split from the 
European Union.
Europe’s top budget airlines called on politicians to make aviation a key focus when formal Brexit talks start next 
week.
As things stand, Britain will exit an accord granting EU carriers free movement across the bloc, forcing the industry 
to fall back on restrictive bilateral deals and potentially grounding flights, Ryanair warned, even if both carriers 
labelled as “positive” a potential change in British prime minister Theresa May’s stance after losing her 
parliamentary majority.
“A softer Brexit doesn’t guarantee the continuation of open skies,” said Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair’s marketing chief.
“That remains our biggest issue. Absolutely, start the talks next Monday, but put connectivity between Britain and 
Europe at the top of the agenda so that we get a solution before Christmas and don’t have to continue reducing our 
plans.”
Ryanair has said that Britain could lose its air links with EU countries for several months after Brexit becomes a 
reality in 2019 if aviation isn’t made a priority in negotiations. While based in Dublin, it draws about 40 per cent of its 
customers from Britain and counts London Stansted as its biggest base.
The threat to routes arises because the open-skies regime is governed by the European Court of Justice, Jacobs 
said, so that an entirely new EU-British arrangement would need to negotiated.
Airlines push for new open skies policies
Without that, flights would be limited by earlier bilateral treaties typically dating from the 1980s that might, for 
example, restrict Ireland-London services to just three a day versus 30 now.
“You could have a period where there’s nothing in place,” Jacobs said. “That’s the doomsday scenario, where you 
just don’t have flying between Europe and Britain. People will say this is Ryanair being alarmist. But as we sit here 
today from a regulatory point of view it’s absolutely possible.”
Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary was an outspoken opponent of Brexit in the run up to last year’s vote, and 
has slowed capacity growth in Britain to 6 per cent this year from more than 15 per cent in 2016. Expansion could 
be stepped up again if open skies access was to be guaranteed, Jacobs said.
EasyJet chief executive Carolyn McCall said a so-called soft Brexit will be a good thing “if it means a pragmatic and 
realistic approach to leaving the EU” and recognises the importance of a liberal and deregulated aviation regime.
At the same time McCall said that she, too, is concerned about the “finite amount of time” for talks, suggesting 
Britain should consider seeking transitional aviation arrangements to allow complex issues to be addressed.
“This is now in the hands of politicians,” she said. “They are going to have to deliver, because otherwise there is 
going to be a problem on both sides. You’re affecting consumers everywhere, that’s why aviation has been at the 
forefront saying this is really, really a priority.”
As a British carrier, EasyJet may also need to adjust its ownership structure so that it is majority owned by EU 
nationals. That level currently stands at 48 per cent of shareholders. The airline remains “on track” to source an air 
operating certificate located in mainland Europe this summer, something it may require to carry on serving routes 
between remaining EU countries, McCall said.
Trade group Airports Council International Europe said at its annual meeting last week that Brexit is “putting at risk” 
a European single aviation market that’s been “indispensable” for economic growth, cohesion and jobs.
“The results of the British elections have only increased our concerns over the prolonged uncertainty that comes 
with Brexit,” said Augustin de Romanet, ACI Europe’s president and the chief executive of Groupe ADP, which runs 
Paris’s airports. Those worries include a “a cliff-edge scenario which would see Britain exiting the EU without an 
alternative and bespoke trade agreement”.
Asked about May’s likely reliance on a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party in keeping her Conservatives in 
power, Ryanair’s Jacobs said that “unstable government is never a good thing”.
“From an Irish business point of view, the DUP want a soft border in Northern Ireland, that’s a good thing,” Jacobs 
said. “The DUP are also in favour of a softer version of Brexit, and I would welcome those two things.”

signs that aircraft order activity will match the high levels seen two years 
ago.

The air transport industry descends on Paris for the biennial air show with few signs that aircraft order activity will 
match the high levels seen two years ago.
Aircraft manufacturers disclosed airline and lessor order commitments for just under 1,000 aircraft – including 428 
firm orders – at the 2015 Paris air show. Additionally, 224 options were spanned by deals outlined during that show.
This marked the third consecutive time that order-commitment announcements at one of the industry's two biennial 
air shows exceeded the 1,000 mark – though that does include some firming-up of previously announced 
preliminary deals – after significant orders were racked up during the previous Paris air show and Farnborough 
2014. Sandwiched in-between were huge orders from the Gulf carriers unveiled at the 2013 Dubai air show.
Against this backdrop of record order backlogs, and with little near-term availability of slots for most of the major 
programmes, an easing-off in the relentless order pace has seemed likely.
That process began at last year's Farnborough air show. Aside from the AirAsia commitment for up to 200 Airbus 
A321neos, it was a relatively quiet show for order announcements. Total order commitments unveiled at the show – 
both firm and tentative – stood at 607. There were also 135 options.
Speaking at a media briefing during the IATA AGM in Cancun earlier this month, Airbus's chief operating officer for 
customers John Leahy said the next few years were likely to be relatively quiet, as airlines focus on digesting their 
large volume of orders.
"We have a backlog right now which is a record not only for Airbus but the industry ever. The airlines have to slow 
down their ordering, take a breath and start absorbing the airplanes that they ordered," he says.
ANALYSIS: Will the Paris air show bring much order activity? The air transport industry descends on Paris for 
the biennial air show with few signs that aircraft....
"This could last a year or two, which is not an issue."
Asked specifically about the expectations for Paris, Leahy coyly said: "We're not expecting a record number of new 
orders." But he would not be drawn further on how many orders might be announced at the show or who might 
place them.
However, he believes Boeing may see a bump in orders at the show if it chooses to use the event to launch the 737 
Max 10X. Indonesian carrier Lion Air is among those heavily tipped as possible launch customers for Boeing's 
proposed double-stretch of its re-engined single-aisle aircraft. United Airlines, Norwegian, SpiceJet and Ryanair are 
also among those linked with possible interest.
But some of the commitments for the aircraft, which if launched would be set to enter service in 2020, could take 
the form of conversions of existing orders rather than fresh business. Either way, Boeing will be giving another Max 
model – the 9 – a Le Bourget debut.
In the widebody arena, key programmes are in need of kick-starting. Boeing has secured only Singapore Airlines as 
a new 777X customer since the last Paris air show, while for Airbus's A380 a well-documented drought continues. 
Since lessor Amedeo firmed a 20-unit deal back in February 2014, the double-decker has had more cancellations 
(12) than new orders (five).
Elaboration of future programmes could fill any space created by lack of order activity. Boeing may share more 
details – and perhaps a mocked-up image – of its New Midsized Aircraft. That prospect could tempt Airbus to share 
findings from its own middle-of-the-market investigations, whether or not those include the rumoured "A322" stretch 
of its A321. In Toulouse earlier this month, Leahy indicated his belief that 400-500nm more range can be squeezed 
out of the A321neo, beyond the 4,000nm promised by the A321LR.
Back in the present day, Airbus could add momentum to its A330neo programme with new deals, and will be 
showing off its A350-1000. Boeing will meanwhile have its 787-10 on static display.
Much of the business placed at the recent order peak of the air shows came from aircraft lessors – for example, 
around a third of the order commitments from the Paris air show two years ago were from lessors. But armed with 
their substantial orderbooks, there was relatively little activity from this sector at Farnborough last year, and few 
signs so far suggest things will be different at Paris this year.
One lessor that placed an order at Le Bourget last time out has already ruled out any prospect of a repeat this year, 
namely SMBC Aviation Capital. "Obviously we have a good relationships with the OEMs, and stay in regular 
contact, but we are happy with our orderbook at the moment, particularity our commitments to the Neo and the 
Max," chief executive Peter Barrett told FlightGlobal.
Neither is there much sign of heavy order activity from aircraft manufacturers beyond Airbus and Boeing, though 
Bombardier will be looking to come out fighting after the US Trade Commission recently handed down an 
unfavourable ruling in the dispute over CSeries funding and sales tactics.
Embraer will meanwhile be hopeful of adding to its 275 total orders for the E2 E-Jets – which would account for less 
than three years of production, at last year's rate of output – with US scope-clause changes having given the E175-
E2 impetus.
The Brazilian manufacturer may also share more of its thinking on the viability of a new-generation turboprop, 
having recently identified a potential market for one. And perhaps we might learn whether Lockheed Martin's 
adaptation of the Super Hercules into a commercial freighter, the LM-100J, is tempting Embraer to pursue a similar 
strategy with the KC-390.
Embraer's commercial aviation chief executive John Slattery recently labelled ATR turboprops "old technology", but 
the Airbus-Leonardo joint venture is set to confirm new operators at the show, start-up Air Senegal among them.
ANALYSIS: Will the Paris air show bring much order activity? The air transport industry descends on Paris for 
the biennial air show with few signs that aircraft....
Japan's Mitsubishi Aircraft will showcase its MRJ regional jet at an air show for the first time, as it tries to instil 
confidence in the programme after multiple delays.
Comac is unlikely to be signing any orders for the C919 at the show. The Chinese manufacturer's focus at Paris, is 
to meet with various suppliers for both the in-development narrowbody, as well as the Sino-Russia widebody 
project.
With production rates rising and backlogs full, net orders for Airbus and Boeing this year are unlikely to exceed the 
total number of deliveries. Guidance issued in February indicates that the two major manufacturers will deliver close 
to 1,500 aircraft in 2017, suggesting that they are likely, at best, to only slightly exceed their 2016 combined tally of 
1,400 net orders.
Flight Fleets Analyzer shows there have been 356 commercial aircraft orders logged over the first five months of 
the year, including 240 narrowbodies and 74 widebodies.

Next suffered the sharpest fall since its January profit warning yesterday as retailers led the FTSE 100 sharply 
lower.
A store survey "would seem to suggest that Next has cut entry-level pricing during spring-summer, possibly in 
response to the very poor first-quarter sales", Credit Suisse told clients. Its survey of European retailers found 
"significant and widespread" markdowns amid weak demand and online competition, with retailers aiming for a 
narrower range of price points in the face of rising dollar costs.
With sales migrating online and the UK showing no signs of recovery, Next is pursuing the wrong strategy, Credit 
Suisse argued. "Continuing to add space and increase prices feels wrong and, while self-help to apparel collections 
may improve through the year, the environment for homeware is likely to deteriorate."
Next, down 6.1 per cent to £40.37, takes some support from a near 8 per cent dividend yield, said Credit Suisse. 
But "with earnings, margins and cash conversion continuing to fall we regard Next as a value trap", it said.
The rest of the sector retreated after unexpectedly weak UK retail sales figures for May and a profit warning from 
sofa retailer DFS, which slumped 20.6 per cent to 200p. Marks and Spencer lost 4.7 per cent to 351.8p and 
Kingfisher faded 2.8 per cent to 301.5p.
The FTSE 100 ended 0.7 per cent lower at 7,419.36, a 55.04 point fall, as hawkish signals from both the Bank of 
England and the US Federal Reserve triggered a broad sell-off.
Next looks shabby as retailers get dressing down across the board London
ITV slipped 3.1 per cent to 179.1p after a downgrade to "neutral" from Macquarie. "Valuation looks attractive and 
ITV remains a credible takeover target, but we believe wandering British politics will inevitably affect advertising 
spending in 2017-18," it said.
British Airways owner IAG lost 3.4 per cent to 584p, having confirmed it faces an £80m bill for May's IT system 
failure.
Goldman Sachs cut IAG to "neutral", largely on valuation grounds. IAG's free cash flow yield is at a peak level 
versus history with an uncertain outlook due to Brexit and the expansion of low-cost carriers to long-haul routes, it 
said.
Goldman advised switching into Ryanair, off 0.7 per cent to (EURO)18.17.
Petrofac was up 3.9 per cent to 421p after Jefferies turned positive with a 500p target. The recent extension of a 
credit facility and a contract win in Kuwait show the oilfield services group can continue near normal in spite of the 
Serious Fraud Office investigation overhanging it, said Jefferies.
Suspending the dividend should go a long way to protecting Petrofac from breaching debt covenants, assuming it 
can win $3bn of engineering and construction contract awards this year, against $2bn of business already 
announced, said the broker.

Next, down 6.1 per cent to £40.37, takes some support from a near 8 per cent dividend yield, said Credit Suisse. 
But "with earnings, margins and cash conversion continuing to fall we regard Next as a value trap", it said.
The rest of the sector retreated after unexpectedly weak UK retail sales figures for May and a profit warning from 
sofa retailer DFS , which slumped 20.6 per cent to 200p. Marks and Spencer lost 4.7 per cent to 351.8p and 
Kingfisher faded 2.8 per cent to 301.5p.
Next looks shabby as retailers get dressing down across the board London
The FTSE 100 ended 0.7 per cent lower at 7,419.36, a 55.04 point fall, as hawkish signals from both the Bank of 
England and the US Federal Reserve triggered a broad sell-off.
ITV slipped 3.1 per cent to 179.1p after a downgrade to "neutral" from Macquarie. "Valuation looks attractive and 
ITV remains a credible takeover target, but we believe wandering British politics will inevitably affect advertising 
spending in 2017-18," it said.
British Airways owner IAG lost 3.4 per cent to 584p, having confirmed it faces an £80m bill for May's IT system 
failure .
Goldman Sachs cut IAG to "neutral", largely on valuation grounds. IAG's free cash flow yield is at a peak level 
versus history with an uncertain outlook due to Brexit and the expansion of low-cost carriers to long-haul routes, it 
said.
Goldman advised switching into Ryanair , off 0.7 per cent to EUR18.17.
Petrofac was up 3.9 per cent to 421p after Jefferies turned positive with a 500p target. The recent extension of a 
credit facility and a contract win in Kuwait show the oilfield services group can continue near normal in spite of the 
Serious Fraud Office investigation overhanging it, said Jefferies.
Suspending the dividend should go a long way to protecting Petrofac from breaching debt covenants, assuming it 
can win $3bn of engineering and construction contract awards this year, against $2bn of business already 
announced, said the broker.

Budget carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle hopes to have deal set up with either Ryanair or easyJet this year that would 
bring short-haul passengers to its long-haul network.
"We are speaking to both... We are fairly sure we will be able to set up a system with one of them this year," Bjorn 
Kjos said on the sidelines of an event in Paris, adding he did not know which would be first.
Norwegian offers low-cost long-haul flights, but needs the passengers to feed into that network to fill its planes and 
make money.
The partners still need to create a joint interface for ticket sales before the feeder flight deal can proceed.
Kjos said the concept could work at airports such as Paris Charles de Gaulle and Gatwick with easyjet and in 
Ireland for Ryanair. He said he expected two hours would be plenty for transfer times.
He also said he was "definitely interested" in a new mid-market jet that Boeing is studying.
He ruled out however the 737 Max 10, set to be launched at the Paris air show, because it does not offer any extra 
range. (Reuters)    Source: www.businessworld.ie

UBER director David Bonderman has resigned from the board of the ridehailing company after making what many 
perceived as a sexist remark - at a staff meeting convened to address sexism within the tech firm.
During a meeting on Tuesday, Uber board member Arianna Huffington spoke to employees about the importance of 
adding more women to the board of directors.
"There's a lot of data that shows when there's one woman on the board, it's much more likely that there will be a 
second woman on the board," she said. Bonderman responded: "Actually, what it shows is that it's much more likely 
to be more talking."
A recording of the meeting was published by Yahoo and an Uber spokesman verified the authenticity and accuracy 
of the recording, Reuters reported.
Bonderman, a founder of TPG Capital which invests in Uber, has also served as chairman of the Ryanair board 
since 1996. He tendered his resignation from Uber on Tuesday evening and as of yesterday was no longer a board 
member. His departure follows the announcement that Uber boss Travis Kalanick would take a leave of absence for 
an as yet undetermined amount of time.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) and London-listed EasyJet (EZJ.L), two of Europe's largest budget airlines, said that a softer 
version of Britain's exit from the European Union still wouldn't ease their concerns, Bloomberg reported. 
Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to secure a majority for her Conservative party at an election last week has 
given rise to speculation that the government will seek a softer Brexit, one that prioritizes the economy over 
immigration, rather than the hard Brexit she had propagated, according to reports. 
With Britain leaving the EU it will exit an accord granting EU carriers free movement across the bloc, forcing the 
industry to make bilateral deals, Ryanair said, adding that this may potentially ground flights, according to the 
report. 
A soft Brexit will be a good thing "if it means a pragmatic and realistic approach to leaving the EU" and recognizes 
the importance of a liberal and deregulated aviation regime, EasyJet CEO Carolyn McCall told journalists on 
Tuesday, according to Bloomberg. 
McCall said she was concerned about the short time for talks to conclude, adding that Britain should consider 
seeking transitional aviation arrangements for the period after Brexit. EasyJet may also need to adjust its ownership 
structure to increase the share of EU-based shareholders to a majority from 48% currently, according to the report.

LONDON MARKET OPEN: Housebuilders Lead Gains After Bellway Update

 Stocks in London opened higher on Wednesday, with housebuilders among the best performers following an 
upbeat trading update from mid-cap Bellway, while blue-chip British American Tobacco was down despite saying 
trading was "in line".
Market attention in the morning is likely to be on UK employment and earnings figures at 0930 BST. Later in the 
day, investor focus will shift to the US, as the Federal Reserve reveals its monetary policy decision following the 
two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting. 
The FTSE 100 index of London large caps was up 0.1%, or 8.94 points, at 7,509.38. The FTSE 250 index was up 
0.7% at 19,991.14 points, and the AIM All-Share index was up 0.2% at 974.68.
The BATS UK 100 index was up 0.1% at 12,734.10, and the BATS 250 up 0.6% at 17,167.05. The BATS Small 
Companies was up 0.2% at 11,976.73.
FTSE 250-listed Bellway was up 3.2% after saying it expects its operating margin for the current year to exceed the 
previous year due to a "strong" sales demand. The housebuilder expects the operating margin for the year ended 
July 31 to be slightly in excess of 22%, which would improve last year's "record" performance.
From February 1 to June 4, Bellway said that sales demand was "strong" across the UK, increased throughout 
spring and was not affected by the recent general election. 
Other housebuilding stocks benefited from Bellway's positive update, with FTSE 100-listed Taylor Wimpey and 
Barratt Developments both up 1.7%, while Persimmon was 1.6% higher. 
BAT shares were down 0.8%, among the biggest FTSE 100 fallers. The tobacco giant said trading is in line with 
expectations as the business continues to perform "very well" in the first half of 2017. The firm said revenue in the 
six months ending June 30 is expected to benefit from good pricing, as its Global Drive Brands help boost market-
share growth.
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Housebuilders Lead Gains After Bellway Update
Volume will suffer against a strong prior-year comparator as well as from the phasing of shipments in a number of 
key markets. However full-year volume, which is expected to decline by 4%, should outperform the wider industry, 
BAT said.
BAT said it continues to expect profit growth to be weighted to the second half of the year, mainly due to the timing 
of volume shipments, as well as the phasing of Next Generation Product investments and marketing spend.
easyJet was up 2.3%, the best blue-chip performer, while Ryanair Holdings was up 0.8% and Wizz Air up 0.3%. 
Davy Research said low-cost carriers should benefit from "positive pricing trends" into the summer.
easyJet was lifted to Neutral from Underperform by Davy, and Ryanair was upgraded to Outperform from Neutral. 
Wizz Air was left at Neutral. 
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 index in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt were up 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.
In Asia on Tuesday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.1%. In China, the Shanghai Composite ended 
down 0.7%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was flat. 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday softened her tone on her country's negotiations to leave the EU, 
welcoming the "good process" set out by the bloc for the talks.
Speaking alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after a working dinner in Paris, May said that with 
"willingness and intent on both sides to build...[a] future partnership," she believed a deal could be reached that 
would be in the interests of all sides.
Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster said on Tuesday talks on supporting May's minority government are 
making progress and should be concluded soon. Talks are due to continue on Wednesday.
"Discussions are going well with the government and we hope soon to be able to bring this work to a successful 
conclusion," Foster said on Twitter after talks at Downing Street, May's London office.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2786 on Wednesday after the London equities open, up from USD1.2729 at the 
close on Tuesday. 
Following the last lift to US interest rates in March, investors are well prepared for another 25 basis point increase 
to the Fed's target for the federal funds rate, which would take the range to between 1.00% and 1.25%.
The FOMC will announce its decision, alongside economic projections, at 1900 BST, with Fed Chair Janet Yellen 
hosting a press conference at 1930 BST.
Elsewhere in the economic calendar, in the US, MBA mortgage applications are at 1200 BST. Retail sales are at 
1330 BST, as well as the US consumer price index. EIA crude oil stocks are at 1530 BST.

 The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices on Wednesday.----------FTSE

2,425.00p at the open on Wednesday. 
Ryanair Holdings was up 0.9% at EUR18.33. Ryanair remains the broker's "top pick", expecting the Irish carrier's 
shares to trade at EUR25 in the medium term, 33% up from where they are now.----------FTSE 100 - LOSERS--------
--GKN, down 1.0%. The automotive and aerospace engineer was downgraded to Sell from Hold by Panmure 
Gordon. The broker expects the shares to underperform going forward as it believes consensus expectations of 
double-digit growth in pretax profit and earnings per share for 2017 are too high. "At this stage, we see a slump in 
US auto market and delays/cancellations in Mid-East airlines as the primary catalysts for downgrades," Panmure 
said. 
Micro Focus International, down 0.7%. Citigroup cut the software company to Neutral from Buy. ----------FTSE 250 - 
WINNERS----------Bellway, up 4.3%. The housebuilder said it expects its operating margin for the year to exceed 
the previous year due to a "strong" sales demand. Bellway said it expects its operating margin for the year ended

by the recent general election. The company reported a 13% increase in the reservation rate to 221 per week from 
196 per week in the same period last year. "Robust market conditions, together with a clear operational focus, is 
enabling Bellway to continue increasing its contribution to the supply of much needed new homes," the company 
said. Blue-chip housebuilding stocks also benefited, with Barratt Developments up 2.1%, while Taylor Wimpey and 
Persimmon were both 1.8% higher. 
CLS Holdings, up 2.7%. The property investment company said it has agreed to acquire a portfolio of 12 properties 
in Germany from Swiss-listed property group Zublin Immoblien, for EUR148.0 million, representing a net initial yield

of 6.3%. The portfolio is primarily clustered around the cities of Hamburg, Dussledorf and Stuttgart, and comprises 
963,596 square feet of multi-let office space, with a current occupancy rate of 89%. It is let to 157 tenants with a 
weighted unexpired lease term of 3.3 years.----------FTSE 250 - LOSERS----------Halma, down 1.8%. HSBC cut the 
safety, health and environmental technology firm to Hold from Buy. Halma said Tuesday it saw a steep rise in its 
profit and revenue in its recently ended financial year, boosted by the effects of a weaker pound. ----------MAIN 
MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS----------Gemfields, up 13% at 40.25 pence. The miner's shares recovered ground 
lost since its largest shareholder, Pallinghurst Resources, made an unsolicited approach for the business last 
month after a rival bidder entered the frame by tabling an initial proposal. Pallinghurst made its share and cash offer 
equal to 38.5p per share in May. On Wednesday, rival Fosun Gold confirmed it has made an "initial proposal" to 
takeover Gemfields in an all-cash deal for 40.85p per share, a 15% premium to the closing share price on Tuesday. 
Fosun Gold said its offer represents a 10% premium to that offered by Pallinghurst. Fosun said Pallinghurst's offer 
is now equal to 37.10p per Gemfields share based on Pallinghurst's closing share price on Tuesday. As 
Pallinghurst's offer is a cash and share deal, movements in its own share price impact the implied value of 
Gemfields share under its offer.

Ryanair in talks with Boeing over new version of 737
Ryanair in talks with Boeing over new version of 737

European low-cost airline Ryanair is in talks with Boeing about placing an order for its proposed new 737 MAX 10 
airliner, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Boeing is expected to launch what would become the largest version of its 737 MAX medium-haul family, designed 
to challenge the popular Airbus A321 flown by Ryanair rivals, at the opening of the Paris air show next week.
A Boeing spokesman for the region declined to comment.
A Ryanair spokesman said: "We do not comment upon rumor or speculation."
Ireland-based Ryanair, which was the launch customer for the 196-passenger Boeing MAX 200 aircraft in 2014, is 
in discussions about buying the new plane which seats up to 230 passengers, the people said. It currently only flies 
189-seat 737-800s.
It was not clear if a MAX 10 order would be in addition to or at least partly a substitute for the MAX 200 order for 
100 planes.
Talks are progressing but it also remained unclear whether a deal would be ready in time for the June 19-25 air 
show, one of the people said. Ryanair rarely attends such events and is expected to hold out for the best possible 
price before placing an order.
Ryanair executives have said repeatedly in recent months that they would be interested in additional aircraft if they 
were available at the right price, saying the only thing curtailing faster growth was a lack of available planes.
Ryanair in talks with Boeing over new version of 737
Chief Executive Michael O’Leary said in May Ryanair was talking to Boeing about opportunistically adding planes to 
its current order and for additional orders to cover growth from 2023 to 2028.
The latest talks come as Hungarian rival Wizz Air shifts from the 180-seat A320 to A321s which can carry up to 239 
passengers and has said it hopes the larger planes will help bring its unit costs below those of Ryanair.
UK budget airline easyJet said in May it would take 30 Airbus A321neo jets with 235 seats from next summer, 
instead of 30 smaller A320neo planes, which it said would enable it to reduce costs per seat on affected trips by 
around 8 to 9 percent.
Indonesia's Lion Air is also preparing to place an order for the 737 MAX 10, Reuters reported last week. Industry 
sources said the carrier could order about 50 planes but that some may displace earlier orders for other 737 
models. (Reuters)

Revealed: the Irish companies profiting from Draghi’s QE gamble
Revealed: the Irish companies profiting from Draghi’s QE gamble

Highlight: In a stunning allegation of crony capitalism, a group of MEPs have claimed that ECB boss Mario 
Draghi’s huge programme of quantitative easing is benefiting a tiny group of favoured companies – a number of 
them Irish 
Body
It’s been two years since Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, announced a massive, multibillion-
euro programme of bond purchases designed to breathe life into flatlining inflation figures in the eurozone. Since 
then, Frankfurt has spent hundreds of billions on government debt and, latterly, corporate debt.
When the programme was launched, it was welcomed with open arms; for so long, Europe had been seen as the 
laggard while the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England pushed ahead with QE, seen by many as a vital 
ingredient in the post-crisis recipe to boost demand and economic growth. Helped by increasing energy prices, 
inflation has been dragged up towards towards the bank’s target of 2 per cent.
But now a group of MEPs are crying foul on the ECB’s efforts. In a letter to Draghi last month, the MEPs warned 
that purchases may be benefiting just a small group of favoured companies in what would be, if true, an astonishing 
case of crony capitalism.
So just who benefits from QE?
Ramon Tremosa is a Catalan economist and MEP who sits on the parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs 
committee. He is among the signatories to the letter sent to Draghi.
His concerns were prompted, he says, by rumours that just three or four companies in Spain are benefiting from the 
bond purchasing. And he also has a more general concern about the levels of information published on how much 
is being spent on individual companies’ debt, and when. Without this information, he says that the ECB’s 
programme is creating a market distortion – tilting the level playing field.
Revealed: the Irish companies profiting from Draghi’s QE gamble
“The ECB has this massive weapon, and it doesn’t give any information; it is not accountable to anyone,” he says. 
“It creates money with a printing machine, it doesn’t explain anything. What about market discipline and 
competitiveness?”
Take Ireland, for example: According to data published on the website of the Finnish Central Bank, which 
purchases bonds on behalf of Ireland, the DAA, Ryanair, ESB, Kerry Group, CRH, Gas Networks Ireland and 
Liberty Mutual have all had their debt purchased. The same is true for international companies whose Irish 
subsidiaries have had their bonds bought, like Fresnius, a German kidney dialysis company, or Eaton Corporation, 
the power management company which is headquartered in Dublin but operates globally.
The problem is that there is no way of telling how much has been spent on these companies’ debt and whether, 
within that list, some companies are getting the lion’s share. And, as Tremosa says, there could be competition 
implications. For example, he points to the struggling Italian flagship airline Alitalia. “For instance, in Ireland there 
has been purchased Ryanair debt. What about Alitalia? They are in a huge crisis,” he says.
Fine Gael MEP Brian Hayes recently co-signed a question with Tremosa, calling on the ECB to disclose how much 
the bank holds of different companies’ debts in an effort to facilitate “more accurate scrutiny against possible 
sectoral bias”. The letter also calls on Frankfurt to publish more detail on the programme’s operating guidelines – 
effectively, for it to explain to citizens how the corporate bonds are selected.
While Hayes is not sold on allegations of crony capitalism or favouritism, he says that the ECB is not clear enough 
about its programme, and who is benefiting from it.
Ultimately, a company whose debt is being purchased can often avail of lower borrowing costs – the idea is that 
they will pump the extra cash they hold into the real economy by hiring or upping their dividends.
But in reality, it can be difficult to track what corporates do with the extra money – and without an accurate register 
of how much debt is being bought from an individual company, measuring the impact on the real economy, and its 
effect on competition in the market, is difficult.
“The level of transparency in relation to the bond purchases is very low,” says Hayes.
When asked about releasing more information at the Econ committee last month, Draghi effectively said it was up 
to local Central Banks to publish. The Irish Central Bank said that it does not provide the purchase amounts for 
individual firms, while the ECB only publishes the aggregate figures on a total monthly spend.
This, according to Hayes, is not good enough.
“The ECB should develop a single aggregate database with the essential information about the bond purchases on 
a country by country basis. I believe this should include the name of the company and where necessary, the volume 
of funds involved,” he said.
The problem with massive market interventions like QE, according to Ryan McGrath, head of fixed income strategy 
and research at Cantor Fitzgerald in Dublin, is that they are hard to control. When something like this is unleashed, 
the implicit trade-off for achieving a wider goal is tolerating a certain amount of collateral damage.
“A theme of QE, in the government and corporate bond market, is unintended consequences,” he says. “You’ve just 
got to accept that they sat down, they attempted to make the criteria as broad-based as they could, and they’re not 
going to please everyone with it.”
The ECB, he says, has been fairly parsimonious in the information it has shared on its QE programme. “The whole 
project has been quite opaque, be it on the government bonds side (or) the corporate side.”
This practice is unlikely to change any time soon, McGrath says. With most analysts predicting that Draghi will 
begin to taper bond purchases in the summer, the horse may already have bolted. But for MEPs like Tremosa, the 
long-term consequences of how QE has worked, and who it benefited, are grave. “No one [has to] show anything, 
Revealed: the Irish companies profiting from Draghi’s QE gamble
[there is] no will for transparency . . . we are creating a monster, entering an unknown garden and the exits are not 
very clear,” he said.

 The likely formation of a governing majority in the UK through the Conservatives and Democratic Unionist Party is 
likely to lead to softer Brexit and provide a boost to cross-border transport firms, but the weaker pound will not be 
welcomed.
With sterling already faltering and still struggling to find its feet following the Brexit referendum last year, the snap 
election result on Friday has not helped the currency find ground after the Conservative party did not achieve the 
outright majority that many had expected. 
However, the surprise result does present an opportunity for transport firms that are facing the possibility of new 
borders and a tougher time moving planes, trains and buses in and out of the UK and European Union. 
But, with the DUP in Northern Ireland not in support of a so-called hard Brexit, the result means the likelihood of a 
soft Brexit has increased, according to RBC Capital Markets Richard Hatch.  
"If the UK election result is perceived to reduce the probability of a hard Brexit, beneficiaries would include Wizz Air 
and Ryanair. Other beneficiaries from this include Eurotunnel, easyJet and IAG, however, weaker sterling is a 
headwind for these companies," said the analyst. 
While some of the London's major transport stocks benefit from a weaker pound when translating overseas 
earnings into the UK currency, such as those with US operations like National Express and FirstGroup, many will 
see weaker sterling as a headwind. 
"Immediate nationalisation risk may be reduced for Royal Mail and the bus and rail companies if a Conservative-led 
government is formed, but the election result is not likely to be seen as decisive in this regard," said Hatch.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Tuesday.----------COMPANIES----------Nordic Capital Svenska and 
Avista Capital Holdings have sold 250.0 million shares in medical products firm ConvaTec Group for GBP805.0 
million, increasing the number of shares sold after strong demand. UBS said Nordic and Avista sold a combined 
250.0 million shares at a price of 322.0 pence per share. ----------Rio Tinto said its USD781 million cash tender offer 
to reduce its gross debt was oversubscribed. Rio Tinto launched the cash tender in May as part of an ongoing 
capital management plan. 
Back in May, the company detailed a new plan to reduce its debt by up to USD2.50 billion through a bond 
repurchase programme, following on from USD7.50 billion worth of notes that were redeemed during 2016. On 
Tuesday, Rio Tinto said it will purchase USD781 million of securities, including USD144.2 million of 4.125% notes 
due 2021, USD273.9 million of 3.75% notes due 2021, USD231.6 million of 3.50% notes due 2022, and USD131.1 
million of 2.875% notes due 2022.----------Budget airlines Ryanair Holdings and easyJet reported year-on-year 
growth in the number of customers they carried in May. Irish carrier Ryanair said it carried 11% more passengers in 
May, up to 11.8 million from 10.6 million. Load factor also grew, by 1 percentage point, to 95% from 94%. Rival 
easyJet said 9.5% more passengers flew with it in May, up to 7.5 million from 6.9 million a year ago. Load factor, 
however, remained flat at 91.5%.----------International Consolidated Airlines Group's chief executive said human 
error caused the British Airways IT systems crash that left tens of thousands of passengers stranded, the BBC 
reported. Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, speaking at an industry conference in Mexico on Monday said that 
an engineer had disconnected a power supply, causing a surge when it was reconnected, causing major damage. 
Walsh told reporters that the engineer in question has been authorised to be in the data centre near Heathrow, but 
had not been authorised to "do what he did".----------The UK Financial Reporting Council has dropped its 
investigation of PricewaterhouseCoopers's role in the Tesco accountancy scandal, the BBC reported. In a 
statement on Monday, the FRC said there was "not a realistic prospect" of an "adverse finding" against PwC 
approving Tesco's accounts between 2012 and 2014. PwC said in a statement it was pleased with FRC's 
conclusion. The FRC's investigation came after the supermarket overstated its profits for 2014 by GBP326.0 million, 
as Tesco said it had incorrectly booked payments from suppliers.----------AO World reported a slightly wider loss in

its recently-ended financial year, and warned on a slower growth rate for the UK in the first quarter of the new year. 
AO World said its pretax loss in the year ended March 31 widened slightly to GBP7.0 million from GBP6.7 million 
the year before, due to set-up costs associated with the early operations of its business in the Netherlands and 
Germany. Revenue, however, rose to GBP701.2 million from GBP599.2 million, as UK revenue rose by 13% to 
GBP629.7 million, and Europe revenue grew by 52% in constant currency to GBP71.5 million. AO World said 
trading in the UK in the latter part of the year was challenging due to weaker consumer confidence following the 
Brexit vote, subsequent price inflation and a slowdown in the UK housing market, adding that those difficult 
conditions have continued into the new financial year.----------The independent directors of Shawbrook Group 
advised shareholders to take no action in relation to an increased and final offer from a consortium of Pollen Street 
Capital and BC Partners funds. The increased offer, being made through a joint bidding vehicle Marlin Bidco, is at 
340 pence, valuing the specialist lender at GBP868.0 million in total. The stock was quoted on Tuesday at 336.20p, 
down 0.7%. The consortium had previously made an offer for Shawbrook at 330p, but this was rejected by 
Shawbrook, having achieved acceptances from only 45% of the lender's shareholders including the 39% stake held 
by the consortium itself.----------MARKETS----------London shares were lower with ConvaTec the worst blue-chip 
faller, as investors remain cautious ahead of the UK general election on Thursday. Oil was trading below the 
USD50 a barrel mark despite political tension in the Middle East between Qatar and its Arab neighbours. Wall

 The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices on Tuesday.----------FTSE 
100 - WINNERS----------easyJet, up 1.1%. The low-cost carrier reported year-on-year growth in the number of 
customers carried in May. The airline said 9.5% more passengers flew with it in May, up to 7.5 million from 6.9 
million a year ago. Load factor remained flat at 91.5%. Shares in Ryanair were down 0.4%, despite easyJet's rival 
reporting even better May results, with passengers carried up 11% and load factor increasing a notch to 95% from 
94%.
Randgold Resources, up 0.7%. The gold miner was benefiting from a rise in the precious metal's price amid political 
tension in the Middle East and as investors remain cautious ahead of the UK general election on Thursday. Gold 
was quoted at USD1,288.84 an ounce compared to USD1,279.93 an ounce at the London equities close on 
Monday. 
Vodafone Group, up 0.5%. The telecoms company said it has updated its policy on advertising to introduce new 
rules stopping its advertising from appearing within outlets that are creating and sharing hate speech and fake 
news. It noted, however, it has not changed its policy on network access to the outlets in question. Vodafone 
highlighted automated advertising technologies which use algorithms to deliver digital advertising online can lead to 
"unintended and potentially harmful outcomes" in a small minority of instances. Additionally, this can result in 
generating revenue for outlets that focus on hate speech and fake news.----------FTSE 100 - LOSERS----------

was awarded Block 18, offshore Equatorial Guinea, in a recent bidding round. Clontarf said the block covers around 
5,056 kilometres squared of undrilled deep-water acreage, and it will focus on large structural and or stratigraphic 
trap targets. Under the bid terms, Clontarf will take a 70% stake in production interest, and a 65% stake in oil cost 
recovery. An initial work programme will be for three years, although extendible, including seismic acquisition plus
