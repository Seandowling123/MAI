 CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts 
at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:
Our 2021 and 2022 EPS estimates are unchanged, but we lift our target price to $321 from $274 as our 
conservative discounted free cash flow scenario is now BA recovering pre-pandemic peak earnings and free cash 
flow in 2025, rather than our previous assumption of 2027. The closer in recovery assumption is driven by BA once 
again booking large 737 MAX orders even sooner than we expected, including an order of 75 from Ryanair in 
December  and 25 from United Airlines (UAL) in February. BA is also close to delivering as many new 737s (41 in 
Jan-Feb 2021) as Airbus is A320s (45), despite some large markets like China still in the process of recertifying the 
MAX. With the current pace of recovery in new aircraft deliveries and new orders, we think it is a safe bet BA can 
recover pre-pandemic earnings by 2025, and probably even sooner. We continue to value shares in the 
conservative 2025 recovery scenario, though, given elevated leverage, as peak EBIT would cover current interest 
cost by only 4x vs. 22x back in 2018.

AA-rated European equity PM names three areas of strength
AA-rated European equity PM names three areas of strength

Highlight: Comgest’s Alistair Wittet believes certain sectors proved more resilient than expected even despite the 
most recent growth/value rotation.
Body
European healthcare, IT and consumer discretionary will prove fruitful hunting grounds for growth investors in 2021, 
according to Comgest’s Alistair Wittet.
Citywire AA-rated Wittet, who runs several funds at the French fund house, said there was a strong rotation at the 
start of the year towards more cyclical stocks, which had followed a significant and challenging 12 months for many 
growth-focused areas.
However, Wittet told Citywire Selector there are now pockets of strength and added that he had used the past year 
to bolster positions in long-term leaders. This saw allocations increased to the likes of luxury eyewear brand 
EssilorLuxottica in the Comgest Growth Europe ex UK  fund.
It is now a 4.3% position and sits within the top five stocks, which is an increase from 4.0% at the end of the year. 
Wittet, who co-runs the fund with company CEO Arnaud Cosserat, has also used the first quarter to strongly 
increase exposure to Dutch chipmaker ASML, which rose from 6.4% to 7.4% between December and February.
‘We have not changed our philosophy and we would never do based on one event or scenario. Where we have 
made changes is in adding to exposure. We added to Kingspan, we topped up on Campari. We also increased our 
position in Icon, which is an example of a stock we have held for a while but added exposure to last year. We have 
done so by putting cash to work.
‘There are three areas where we found good buying opportunities, namely healthcare, in some of the tech names, 
by which we mean software, and in consumer discretionary as well. Healthcare has grown every year since 1960, 
while IT spending has only gone one way.’
Wittet added that there is potential within the consumer sector due to limitations on spending caused by lockdowns. 
‘I know it is much discussed, but the emerging middle class, which is a European experience too, we are seeing a 
huge amount of pent-up spending. That is caused by people not being able to spend on travel or commuting or in 
other ways, but we see companies that have pricing power and will be able to capitalise on that.’
AA-rated European equity PM names three areas of strength
Linked to this theme, Wittet said a long-running favourite, Ryanair, had been beaten down when air travel was 
suspended but the Comgest team held fast due to the expected long-term potential for the airline company.
‘We have owned Ryanair since the inception of the fund, so six years. We have become convinced this is a leading 
name in European airlines but we didn’t lose faith last year as we believed that Ryanair would come out of this 
strongly. It would come out because they would have a low-cost base and they would be open and transparent with 
their stakeholders, which they were.’
The Comgest Growth Europe ex UK fund returned 48.1% in euro terms over the three years to the end of February 
2021. Its Citywire-assigned benchmark, the FTSE World Europe Ex UK TR EUR, rose 19.5% over the same 
timeframe.

Boeing ( BA ) Gets Orders for 24 737 MAX Jets From 777 Partners
Boeing (BA) Gets Orders for 24 737 MAX Jets From 777 Partners

Zacks Investment Research

Body
Mar 15, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Boeing Company 
BA[1] recently received a purchase deal from private investment firm 777 Partners, wherein the company will add 
24 737-8s to the latter's aviation portfolio, with purchase rights for an additional 60 airplanes. At list prices, the 
transaction amount for 24 737-8 jets would be about $2.9 billion, although there remains a huge scope for 
discounts. Boeing's shares gained 6.8% to close at $269.19 on Mar 12, post the announcement of this deal. 
Significance of the Deal At a time when the entire aerospace industry is witnessing extreme downturns, and Boeing 
in particular witnessed around 460 order cancellations for the 737 MAX jets in 2020, this deal could be of massive 
significance for the company's ailing commercial business. 
More so, the new deal will likely boost Boeing's confidence in approaching other buyers for the 737 MAX jets. 
Moreover, as aircraft buyers anticipate a market recovery going ahead, this deal may encourage other aircraft 
leasing companies to place orders for the 737 MAX jets. What's Favoring Boeing Of Late? Ever since the grounding 
of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft, the company made a series of upgrades to the plane and inducted several pilot 
training protocols, which finally enabled them to receive an approval from the Federal Aviation Administration in 
November 2020, certifying the 737 MAX safe for flying.The approval had an instant positive impact on the company 
as it clinched orders for 75 additional 737 MAX airplanes in December from Europe's largest airline — Ryanair. 
Also, during the same month, Alaska Airlines ALK[2] agreed to buy 23 737 MAX 9 jets. Recently, in March, per a 
CNBC report[3], the United Airlines UAL[4] announced that it is buying 25 additional 737 Max planes and taking 
delivery of other orders earlier than previously planned from Boeing as well.But the big news appeared earlier this 
month. Per major media sources, Boeing is reportedly close to clinching a multibillion-dollar deal from Southwest 
Airlines LUV[5] for a potential order of 130 737 MAX 7 aircraft, alongside significant options for 170 more 737 
aircraft.Interestingly, Boeing recently revealed that in February the aerospace giant registered more new orders for 
commercial planes than cancellations, for the first time in the past 15 months. It received 82 new orders while 
orders for 51 got cancelled.Over the past couple of months, Boeing has received firm orders for its commercial jets 
and also expects to grab major deals in the near future. This will provide a solid blow to Airbus SE, considering 
Boeing has been falling behind its arch rival for over past couple of years, following 737 jets' grounding in March 
2019. Price Performance &#38; Zacks Rank Shares of the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have gained 107.7% in 
the past year compared with the industry[6]'s growth of 43.5%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1

Low-cost carriers are asking the European Union to request airlines to apply a certain share of sustainable fuel to 
all flights but not only short-haul ones.
The European Commission is drawing a plan for carriers to use a minimum share of sustainable aviation fuels 
(SAF) to restrain the aviation industry's CO2 emissions impacting the planet and facilitating global warming. Several 
carriers, such as Easyjet, Ryanair, Wizz Air, Jet2, and environmental groups asking the European Commission to 
make SAF quotas applicable to long-haul trips as well, in addition to flights inside Europe.
"Excluding long-haul flights from the SAFs mandate would mean the very area of our sector that most needs to 
decarbonise would not be covered at all by this legislation," said the letter to the EU's climate and transport policy 
chiefs.
The signatories referred to the air traffic management group's, Eurocontrol's, data, which reveals 6% of flights from 
European airports that flew over 4,000 km accounted for half of the total CO2 emission.
"There is no logic in excluding long-haul flights from SAF usage obligations as this is their only possible way to 
decarbonise," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement.

People are more comfortable about flying than at any time since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic a year ago, 
new research by Swiss bank UBS indicates.
Some 39% of respondents quizzed in the week to 6 March 2021 for UBS's Evidence Lab US Reopening Consumer 
Survey said they would be comfortable travelling, which was the highest positive number since the survey's 
inception in April 2020, said the bank.
Adding to airline optimism will be improving booking trends, UBS added.
April and May's data showed bookings relative to a year ago were  'meaningfully below 50%' compared to falls of 
more than 70% previously.
UBS added that while easing comparatives are now playing a role in the week-to-week improvement, but adjusting 
for this there was still a 6% and 10% week-on-week improvement in domestic booked traffic for March and April.
"We expect the tone across the airline management teams at investor conferences next week to be bullish in 
reflecting these improving booking trends (along with the stimulus bill in hand)."
Shares in British Airways owner IAG (LON:IAG)  eased 1% to 209.7p, EasyJet PLC (LON:EZJ)  was also 1% down 
at 1,020p while Ryanair PLC (LON:RYA) shed 2.5% to (EURO)16.22.

 Budget airlines including EasyJet (EZJ.L) and Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) are calling on the European 
Union to make its upcoming targets for a minimum share of sustainable fuels apply to all flights, Reuters reported 
Thursday, citing a letter they sent to the EU's climate and transport policy heads.
The signatories, which also include Wizz Air (WIZZ.L), and Jet2, asked that any sustainable aviation fuel mandate 
does not only apply to short-haul flights in Europe, but also to long-haul trips to and from the continent. They argue 
that the very segment that most needs to decarbonize should not be entirely left out of the rules, according to the 
report.
The European Commission is drawing up the targets for airlines to curb the industry's CO2 emissions.
EasyJet gained nearly 2% on Thursday afternoon, while Ryanair's shares in Dublin fell 1%.

Boeing (BA) Expects Big 737 MAX Orders From Southwest Airlines
Boeing (BA) Expects Big 737 MAX Orders From Southwest Airlines

Mar 11, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per major media 
sources, The Boeing Company BA[1] is reportedly close to clinching a multibillion-dollar deal from Southwest 
Airlines LUV[2] for its 737 MAX 7 aircraft. Per a report by Reuters[3], as Southwest Airlines plans on refreshing its 
fleet, it intends to potentially place 130 firm orders alongside significant options for 170 more 737 aircraft.At list 
prices, the transaction amount for 130 737 Max jets would be about $13 billion, although there remains huge scope 
for discounts. Boeing's shares gained 6.4% to close at $245.34 on Mar 10, post the announcement of this 
prospective mega deal. Significance of the Deal for Boeing At a time when the entire aerospace industry is 
witnessing a downturn, this prospective deal could be of massive significance to Boeing, which witnessed around 
460 order cancellations for the 737 MAX jets in 2020. The deal is likely to get accomplished as Southwest Airlines, 
in December 2020, revealed its intentions to resume commercial flight services[4] and fly its Boeing 737 MAX from 
March 2021. More so, the news of a possible deal will likely boost the company's confidence in approaching other 
buyers for the 737 MAX jets. 
What's Favoring Boeing Of Late? Ever since the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft, the company made a 
series of upgrades to the plane and inducted several pilot training protocols, which finally enabled it to receive an 
approval from the Federal Aviation Administration ('FAA') in November 2020, certifying that the 737 MAX is safe for 
flying.The approval had an instant positive impact on the company as it cliched orders for 75 additional 737 MAX 
airplanes in December from Europe's largest airline company — Ryanair. Also, during the same month, Alaska 
Airlines ALK[5] agreed to buy 23 737 MAX 9 jets. Recently, in March, per a CNBC report[6], United Airlines UAL[7] 
announced that it is buying 25 additional 737 Max planes and taking delivery of other orders earlier than previously 
planned from Boeing as well.If the deal with Southwest Airlines materializes, it will surely benefit Boeing, which has 
been losing ground to its arch rival Airbus SE over the past couple of years, following 737's grounding in March 
2019. Price Performance &#38; Zacks Rank Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have gained 58.5% in

Ryanair extends funding from UK Covid facility for another year
Ryanair extends funding from UK Covid facility for another year

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday announced that it has received approval to extend its 
unsecured GBP600 million funding under Her Majesty's Treasury and the Bank of England's UK Covid Corporate 
Financing Facility for another 12 months.
The Irish low cost airline said the funds would be redrawn in the coming days, and used for general corporate 
purposes.
On Wednesday last week, Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said at the Transport Select Committee that the 
furlough scheme was "welcome", but "the government has been lamentable in providing other support".
"The furlough scheme falls short of what needs to be done and it will be a very challenging and difficult return to 
normal operation or pre-Covid operation levels and profitability."
In documents accompanying UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak's government budget, it was revealed 
that Air Passenger Duty rates for departures from Britain will increase by GBP2 to GBP82 for travellers with 
economy tickets, and by GBP5 to GBP181 for those in premium cabins.
Ryanair said its balance sheet remains "one of the strongest in the industry", and expects to have over EUR3 billion 
in cash by the end of March.
Shares in Ryanair Holdings were down 0.8% at EUR16.80 on Wednesday in London.

Eurowings (EW, Düsseldorf Int'l) is boosting its presence in the German capital with the opening on April 1 of a new 
base at Berlin Brandenburg Int'l, where it will station three A320-200s, the Lufthansa subsidiary announced. "Others 
are leaving, we are staying here," stated Eurowings Chief Executive Officer Jens Bischof in reference to 
competitors having withdrawn from the German market during the COVID-19 pandemic. easyJet Europe (EC, 
Vienna) and Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) have cut frequencies to the German capital as a result of the pandemic, while 
the demise of Air Berlin (AB, Berlin Tegel) and Germania (ST, Berlin Schönefeld) in 2017 and 2019 respectively left 
a gap in the market. 
The Lufthansa Group claimed a market share of more than 30% at the airport when it opened in October 2020. 
Bischof said Eurowings had flown more than 1,000 departures from Berlin Brandenburg since then, by February 
2021 flying every third departure from the airport. "Berlin is, and will remain, an absolute tourist magnet, and 
culturally and historically remains one of the most exciting metropolises in Europe. Therefore, it is only logical that 
we...expand our presence in the capital by opening our own base. We will be very happy to fly Berliners and 
Brandenburgers on their well-deserved vacations after the lockdown is over," he added. He said the stationing of 
three aircraft at the airport would create more than 100 additional jobs, which would allow many pilots and flight 
crews to return to the capital after many had had to leave in recent years in the wake of airline bankruptcies or the 
withdrawal of some airlines. Following the opening of the base on April 1, Bischof said Eurowings would again 
connect the capital 3x daily (or more on certain days) with Cologne/Bonn, Düsseldorf Int'l, and Stuttgart Manfred 
Rommel. The airline would focus its scheduling on off-peak times. Flights from Berlin to Beirut in Lebanon would be 
added during the summer to cater for a growing market of Visiting Friends and Relatives (VFRs). Meanwhile, 
Eurowings said it is entering the British travel market in response to a surge in demand for flights between the 
United Kingdom and Palma de Mallorca in response to the UK's announced phased lifting of its COVID-19 
lockdown. The leisure specialist has a base on Mallorca and will for the first time connect Manchester Int'l and 
Birmingham Int'l twice weekly with the popular Mediterranean island from the end of May. This means Eurowings 
will connect Mallorca to 24 other airports. A further expansion of UK flights would be considered in the coming 
weeks, the airline said in a statement. Eurowings' most popular holiday destinations include Mallorca, Las Palmas, 
Athens Int'l and Thessaloniki (Greece), Vienna and Salzburg (Austria), Bastia (Corsica), Zagreb and Split (Croatia), 
and Egypt, the company said.

No one looks forward to a resumption of air travel more than aircraft lessors. One in particular, Dublin-based 
AerCap Holdings, plans to bet its balance sheet on a post-pandemic take-off by buying General Electric Capital 
Aircraft Services, valued at about $30bn. Adding the GECAS fleet - more than 1,600 planes in service or on order - 
would make AerCap the undisputed world leader.
Shareholders have high hopes. AerCap's share price has more than doubled since late September. That trajectory 
reflects expectations of a global revival in airline travel. A glance at history reveals that prior to last year global 
airline traffic had only fallen in three of the previous 50 years, according to Ross Harvey at Davy. But any pick-up 
will need time. Airline bookings by mid-February remained down some 70 per cent year on year, according to data 
from industry body Iata.
AerCap takes a more optimistic view and has form for big acquisitions. Back in 2014, it paid $7.6bn to buy 
International Lease Corporation as part of a post financial crisis restructuring of insurance group AIG.
GE has wanted to exit aircraft leasing, part of its diminished GE Capital unit, for some time. A combination with 
AerCap would create a group that owns about 2,000 planes out of more than 12,000 leased worldwide. AerCap 
should be able to better manage this larger portfolio by cutting costs. GECAS lost $786m in 2020, more than double 
AerCap's www.loss.No purchase price has been reported. But one would expect AerCap to use shares given that 
its enterprise value to forward ebitda ratio of 10 times is near 10-year highs.
AerCap argues that airlines will owe too much to debtors to put up new capital for aircraft when passengers do 
return. They will therefore need to lease planes. To prepare, the top seven lessors raised nearly $15bn in capital in 
AerCap /GE: heavy payload Twitter : @FTLex
January alone, not far from what was raised in the second half of last year, according to Dealogic. But this demand 
could be met by the existing supply of 542 planes for sale or lease last year, more than double the previous year, 
using Airfinance Journal data.
Those interested in a leveraged bet may find AerCap's proposition appealing. But airlines such as Ryanair offer a 
more straightforward, less debtheavy way to invest in the return of air travel.

Mar 08, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc's 
RYAAY[1] shares have declined 2.7% of value in the year-to-date period against the industry[2]'s 14.1% 
increase.Let's discuss the reasons for this drab price performance and discuss what lies ahead for the 
company.With renewed lockdowns in the U.K., Ireland and some other countries in the EU following the surge in 
coronavirus cases, Ryanair slashed its fiscal 2021 traffic forecast. The carrier expects fresh lockdowns and other 
travel-related restrictions to further affect travel demand. Notably, the carrier's February traffic was merely 0.5 
million, less than 1.3 million recorded in January 2021. The same is anticipated to be as low as 500,000 in March. 
With this, the airline estimates its fiscal 2021 traffic to be in the 26-30 million range compared with its earlier 
prediction of below 35 million.Due to the coronavirus-induced low demand, the company's fiscal 2020 profits were 
hurt by more than €40 million. The company incurred a loss of €731.3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. 
Amid coronavirus-related uncertainties, Ryanair anticipates fiscal 2021 net loss (pre-exceptional items) to be 
between €850 million and €950 million.However, Ryanair's sound liquidity position is encouraging. At the end of the 
third quarter of fiscal 2021, the company's cash and cash equivalents stood at $4,163 million, way higher than the 
current debt of $2,214 million. This indicates that the company has sufficient cash to meet its current debt 
obligations. Zacks Rank &#38; Stocks to Consider Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-
ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Transportation [3]sector are Kansas City Southern KSU[4], FedEx Corporation 
FDX[5] and Herc Holdings Inc. HRI[6]. Kansas City and FedEx carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Herc Holdings 
sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[7]Long-
term expected earnings per share (three to five years) growth rate for Kansas City, FedEx and Herc Holdings is 
pegged at 15%, 12% and 31.2%, respectively. Zacks Names 'Single Best Pick to Double' From thousands of 
stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From 
those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.You know this 
company from its past glory days, but few would expect that it's poised for a monster turnaround. Fresh from a 
successful repositioning and flush with A-list celeb endorsements, it could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' 
Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in a little more than 9 months and Nvidia 
which boomed +175.9% in one year.Free: See Our Top Stock and 4 Runners Up  > >[8]Want the latest

The old terminal at Lodz Airport Central Poland has gained new life - as a new headquarter for Bartolini Air, the 
largest pilot school in central Europe and the first airline which have its own air base in Lodz. This week, future 
pilots of Ryanair begin their training in the renovated space.
Few years Lodz Airport Management was looking for a new function of the building. Together, with Bartolini Air 
Board, they found a way to breathe new life into it. Two years ago Bartolini Air rented the whole building and 
renovation has started. Now we are able to see first part of the transformation.
Students from all over the world have theoretical trainings in four new lecture rooms named after famous pilots: Jan 
Zumbach, Amilia Earhard, Charles Lindbergh and Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.
The process of renovation is still ongoing. We should see the final effect later this year. First floor will be designed 
for the headquarter of Bartolini Air. Former departure hall will again departure hall but not for all the passengers, it 
will be designed as a modern FBO Terminal.
Bartlomiej Walas, Vice President, Bartolini Air: "For us this is a milestone and another level of development. We 
have shown in this difficult period of the pandemic, that together with Lodz Airport we can build more than many 
other airports have done at that time."
Anna Midera PhD, CEO & President of the Board, Lodz Airport Central Poland: "We are really proud that many 
airline pilots put their first steps in aviation in Lodz. For example, today is the first day of the ,,Ryanair/Bartolini Air 
Mentored Pilot Training Programme". Despite the covid-19 pandemic, there is still a strong demand for pilots. We're 
excited, that the largest aviation school in Poland is our partner and decided to be our neighbor."
The Bartolini Air was founded in 2006. At the very beginning, they trained only tourist pilots. After that, they have 
decided to train professional pilots too. The great opinion in the aviation industry caused that students from all over 
the world come to Lodz. After graduation, many of them were employed in airlines such as WizzAir, Ryanair, Lot.
In Bartolini Air's fleet are 16 aircraft: 2 Cessna Citation Jet, 4 Tecnam P2006T, 6 Tecnam P2008JC, 2 Tecnam 
P2002JF, 1 Tecnam P2010 and 1 CAP 10C.
The interesting fact: Lodz airport handles approx. 800 private flights per year.

Mar 05, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  United Airlines UAL[1] 
dominated headlines in the past week, thanks to its decision to buy 25 additional Boeing 737 MAX planes apart 
from moving forward the delivery of some other Boeing jets from the earlier scheduled date.On the traffic front, the 
demand for Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes'GOL[2] flights in domestic markets plunged 38% in February 2021 over 
the January levels due to the recent spike in coronavirus cases in Brazil. Meanwhile, European carrier Ryanair 
Holdings' RYAAY[3] traffic tanked more than 90% year over year in February as the pandemic continues to dwarf 
air-travel demand.Read the last Airline Roundup here[4]. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. 
United Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), has placed an order for 25 additional Boeing 737 MAX 
planes and pre-scheduled the delivery of some other orders in hopes of acceleration in travel-demand recovery. 
While the 25 additional Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are expected to be delivered in 2023, the carrier has moved up 
deliveries of 40 previously-ordered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to 2022 and five of the same variant into 2023.In total, 
the carrier has firm commitments for 188 Boeing 737 MAX jets[5].You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6].In another development, United Airlines announced that it is partnering with 
premium ground transportation company, Landline, to offer connecting services to two popular destinations in 
Colorado through the Denver International Airport. 
Under the partnership, customers will enjoy seamless travel experience to Breckenridge and Fort Collins on a 
luxury bus from Denver, CO[7].2. Ryanair's February traffic slumped 95% year over year to merely 0.5 million 
guests as coronavirus keeps air-travel demand suppressed. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) for the 
month was 78% compared with the prior year's 92%. On a rolling-annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair (including the 
LaudaMotion unit) plummeted 79% to 32.7 million.3. Due to pandemic-induced dwindling air-travel demand,Gol 
Linhas' traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers, plummeted 50.3% year over year in February. With 
travel demand falling below the year-ago levels, the company reduced its capacity significantly. In February, 
capacity measured in available seat kilometers contracted 50.4%. Since traffic decline and capacity contraction is 
almost at par, load factor was unchanged on a year-over-year basis at 80.8%. Gol Linhas' total monthly departures 
slumped 53.2% and seats tanked 52.6%.4. Per the International Air Transport Association[8], total air-travel 
demand or traffic in January 2021 tanked 72% year over year. Moreover, the reading was worse than the 69.7% 
year-over-year slump recorded in Dec 2020. On the domestic front, demand was down 47.4% versus the pre-
Airline Stock Roundup: UAL 's Order for Boeing 737 MAX Jets, GOL 's Traffic Report & More
pandemic (January 2019) levels. In December 2020, it was down 42.9%. The downside was mainly due to stricter 
domestic travel controls in China over the Lunar New Year holiday period. In international markets, passenger 
demand in January was 85.6% below that witnessed in January 2019. Price Performance The following table shows 
the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the past six months.The table above 
shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
declined 1% over the past week to $102.92. Over the course of six months, the sector tracker surged 69.3%. 
What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will look forward to the February traffic reports from the likes of Allegiant 
Travel Company ALGT[9] and Azul AZUL[10]. Time to Invest in Legal Marijuana If you're looking for big gains, there 
couldn't be a better time to get in on a young industry primed to skyrocket from $17.7 billion back in 2019 to an 
expected $73.6 billion by 2027.After a clean sweep of 6 election referendums in 5 states, pot is now legal in 36 
states plus D.C. Federal legalization is expected soon and that could be a still greater bonanza for investors. Even

Mar 05, 2021( FFT.ie: http://www.fft.ie Delivered by Newstex) ;; With the world grounded as a result of COVID 19, 
two aviation professionals decided to turn their hand at the world of gin making and created Runway28 Premium 
Irish Gin. Co-director MarieAnn Mc Loughlin Dwyer, with a background in both aviation and product development, 
and wife to one of Ireland's many grounded commercial airline pilots, researched, studied and blended in 
collaboration with the master distiller &#38; recipe experts at Listoke Distillery in Co. 
Louth, to craft and create Runway28 Premium Irish Gin. 'Runway28 Gin is a classic mix of earthy botanicals, with a 
hint of pepper. I wanted to celebrate and commemorate our small nation of pioneers, the spirited Irish, to highlight 
our unique nature and tradition, our ability to adapt, forge forward, and get creative, especially in the face of 
massive disruption,' said MarieAnn. 'The gin for me, is the perfect combination of all that I've learned over the 
years, much of which I owe to my time working within the Aviation industry. Teamwork, communication, goal setting 
and hard work, all remain constants for me from my early days of training as a member of cabin crew with Aer 
Lingus back in 1999, to my subsequent days working with Ryanair, and many other airlines traveling from base to 
base as a product developer and trade show host.' [embedded content] MarieAnn is joined by daughter Karen 
(sales training &#38; promotion) and step-daughter Siobhan (accounts/order fulfilment), in what has now become a 
family effort to push forward with this new gin brand in 2021. Runway28Gin is available online from mid February 
2021. For further information email hellorunway28@gmail.com [1].; [ 1]: hellorunway28@gmail.com

Ryanair has announced it has joined the ambitious "Fuelling Flight Initiative" in its commitment to supporting 
Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) as an essential element to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in the aviation 
industry.
This ambitious initiative provides recommendations on the sustainability aspects of the EU's policy design to 
support SAFs. Together with environmental groups, fellow airlines and research organisations, the group convenes 
to reach consensus on the necessary policies for the transition towards carbon neutral flying.
Ryanair's Director of Sustainability, Tom Fowler, said: "We are delighted to join the 'Fuelling Flight Initiative'. 
Sustainable Aviation Fuels are a key component of airlines' efforts on the road to carbon-neutrality. A transparent 
and future-proof regulatory framework for SAFs can support and equip airlines in their fight against climate change, 
and we are proud to be part of this initiative.
Ryanair's environmental record speaks for itself.  Our Environmental Policy includes investment in new and more 
efficient aircraft, support for research into SAFs, elimination of non-recyclable plastics within 5 years and 
participation in verified carbon projects powered by Ryanair customer donations. With this new initiative, we take a 
further step to the achievement of our decarbonisation targets and the broader UN Sustainable Development 
Goals".
Pete Harrison, the Executive Director of EU Climate Policy of the European Climate Foundation said: "The ECF is 
delighted that Ryanair has joined this initiative. Europe must ensure that future policies only promote the most 
sustainable fuels for reducing the climate impact of aviation, and the EU needs to avoid repeating the mistakes of 
the past. The current Renewable Energy Directive does not ensure that fuels used in Europe meet the sustainability 
standards desired by civil society nor of leading airlines. In the 'Fuelling Flight Initiative', aviation companies, 
research organisations and environmental groups have now reached agreement on this important topic, and we 
propose shared guidelines on how to minimise environmental impacts. Policymakers should take this into 
consideration when defining a policy framework that is fair, affordable and meets the highest sustainability 
standards without compromise."

Ryanair is confident in the start of a recovery in air travel in the UK and Europe in summer this year but is prepared 
for the alternative, its chief executive has said.
The company has registered a "recent surge in bookings" as the UK eases border restrictions from Easter onwards, 
chief executive officer Michael O'Leary said during a media briefing.
"I see very little risk that there won't be reasonable freedom of movement... is it realistic? I can't say, but it's our best 
guess at the moment."
When asked if the carrier had enough cash to withstand another lost summer season, O'Leary simply said: "Yes".
"I see very little chance of restrictions remaining in place and that the entire summer will be a write-off," he added.
"We can survive another lost summer season should travel restrictions remain in place, we have the balance sheet 
and the cash position to sustain that," he added.
He said the company doesn't require any further funding at this time or during summer 2021, having recently 
extended its UK CCFF loan in March.
"We would want to repay that loan sooner rather than later," he added.
"I think that if there is a very strong post-Covid-19 recovery, and I think that there will be... we will see very strong 
cash flows coming back into Ryanair as traffic recovers."
"We will continue at all times to keep our financing under review and, where appropriate, take action," he continued.
Regarding the Boeing 737 Max delivery schedule, O'Leary said the company had expected to take delivery of its 
first Max unit in late March.
However, first deliveries are now expected in April due to certification delays, with eight during the month and 
another eight in May for a fleet of 16 in operation in summer this year.

Norwegian start-up airline Flyr has said it is on track to commence operations at the end of the first half of 2021.
Flyr will target an EBITDAR result from break-even to a margin of 10% in year two of operations, it said in a March 
investor presentation.
Revenue is expected to grow by over 50% year on year in the second year of operations, at which point it also 
expects to be cash flow positive.
It will compete with SAS and Norwegian on domestic routes in Norway, and other operators including Easyjet, Wizz 
Air, KLM, British Airways and Ryanair on international routes.
The company described its main competitive advantages as optimisation of crew utilisation, sustainable fleet 
growth, targeting of only profitable routes and broad industry experience in its management team in order to 
compete with Norwegian and others operating in the Norwegian domestic market.
The airline will look to have 36 full-time employees per aircraft in its fifth year of its operations. According to Flyr, 
this number would be the lowest of any airline operating in the Norwegian market, with 66 per aircraft for SAS and 
58 for Norwegian.
"The Norwegian salary level makes it challenging to be competitive on cost per employee. The key to realising an 
efficient administration is to create a lean, efficient and flat organisational structure with a high degree of digital and 
automated processes which in turn will support data drives decision making", Flyr said.
It also said that its focus on sustainable fleet growth based on demand would enable it to be consistently profitable 
in the long term.
Flyr is targeting eight aircraft in its fleet at the end of the first year of activities, 19 in the second year, 23 in year four 
and 28 thereafter.
"Several of the company's competitors rely on constantly growing fleet size, network and passenger figures, while 
Flyr will aim to adapt and optimise scale and production to demand with a business model that is profitable on a 
lower scale of operation," Flyr added.
Flyr targets sustainable growth
The carrier admitted the inherent risk of starting up with demand visibility low due to Covid-19, but noted that the 
crisis had created a "unique window of opportunity" for securing modern aircraft at historically low prices that under 
normal circumstances would not be obtainable.
As reported by Airfinance Journal, Flyr has opted to use a uniform fleet of Boeing 737-800 aircraft with 186-189 
seats.
Flyr has divided the gradual ramp-up of operations into phases, focusing first on the Norwegian domestic market to 
enable low-cost operations between Norwegian cities.
It will then scale operations in line with demand, expanding to European routes from primary and then secondary 
Norwegian cities.
The entire management team has previously held senior roles at Norwegian as well as other transport and 
technology companies.
The new carrier will be headed up by Tonje Frislid as chief executive officer, who has in the past served as vice-
president crew management at Norwegian.
Brede Huser will serve as chief financial officer, having previously worked at Norwegian for over 14 years as 
executive vice-president of loyalty and chief sales and marketing officer prior to that.
Flyr's chief operating officer, Asgeir Nyseth, held a number of executive positions at Norwegian for over 17 years as 
well as with SAS.

11:06 a.m. ET  First Published: Feb. 26, 2021 at 5:50 a.m. ET IAG expects to fly about 20% of its 2019 schedule in 
the first quarter of this year  British Airways owner IAG flew just a third of its normal schedule in 2020.  jaime 
reina/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images   British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group IAG, 
+3.06%[1] confirmed the biggest loss in its history on Friday, as it called for the introduction of digital health passes 
for passengers to restart international travel. The airlines group reported a full-year operating loss of  7.4 billion[2] 
($9 billion), including exceptional items relating to fuel and currency hedges, early fleet retirement, and restructuring 
costs.That compared with a  2.6 billion profit in 2019, highlighting the scale of the challenges facing the airline 
industry as new strains of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 continue to shut borders and ground aircrafts. 
IAG's operating loss before exceptional items came in at  4.4 billion, slightly better than analysts' expectations. Total 
group revenue fell 69% during the year, to  7.8 billion, as IAG IAG, +2.86%[3]   which also owns Iberia, Aer Lingus 
and Vueling   flew just a third of its normal schedule in 2020. Capacity for the first quarter of 2021 will be 20% of 
2019 levels, down from the previous quarter's 27%, the company said. Luis Gallego, IAG's chief executive who took 
over[4] from Willie Walsh in September, said 2020 had been a year of crisis[5] for the airline industry, but that 
vaccinations were progressing well and infection rates 'are going in the right direction.' Shares in IAG, which have 
fallen by 50% over the last year, compared with a decline of 6% for the wider FTSE 100, rose 3.92% in early 
London trading on Friday. U.K. airline stocks were given a boost earlier this week after Prime Minister Boris 
Johnson announced his road map to take England out of its third lockdown. Read: Airlines and travel stocks surge 
as U.K. sets out lockdown exit plans[6] EasyJet EZJ, +1.48%[7], Ryanair RYA, +0.49%[8], and TUI TUI1, +1.16%[9] 
all reported a jump in bookings to destinations including Spain and Greece, afterJohnson said international trips 
could potentially resume from May 17, subject to review and if there was no resurgence in coronavirus. But it is still 
unclear whether that will include IAG's long-haul routes. 'Getting people traveling again will require a clear road map 
for unwinding current restrictions when the time is right,' said IAG's Gallego, as he called for international common 
testing standards and the introduction of digital health passes 'to reopen our skies safely.' Read: Europe moves 
toward COVID-19 vaccine passports but not every country is on board[10] Passenger revenue dropped 75.5% from  
22.5 billion to  5.5 billion. Given the uncertainty and duration of the coronavirus crisis, IAG IAG, +1.61%[11] couldn't 
provide profit guidance for 2021, the company said. 'IAG's biggest problem is not a pickup in passengers on an 
economic reopening. It will be able to benefit from the return of domestic passengers like its smaller peers easyJet 
: British Airways owner IAG suffers record  7.4 billion loss
and Ryanair,' said MichaelHewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets U.K. 'Its main problem will be getting the 
same levels of long-haul business travel that it had before the pandemic. This is where most big carriers make their 
money, and it is here that normal service may well take a little longer to return to the same levels they were in 
2019.' Read: COVID-19 hotel quarantine from high-risk countries starts in U.K.[12] The airline group has taken 
steps to bolster its liquidity, which currently stands at  10.3 billion, following a  2.7 billion capital increase and a 2 
billion U.K. export finance loan commitment. 'This is higher than at the start of the pandemic,' Gallego said, adding 
that the group continues to reduce its cost base to ensure it emerges 'in a stronger competitive position.'. Net debt 
stood at  9.8 billion at the end of 2020, almost 30% higher than the previous year. The post : British Airways owner

Irish human rights commission says Covid curbs raise serious concerns

Ireland's Human Rights and Equality Commission on Thursday accused the government of having "persistently 
blurred the boundary between legal requirements and public health guidance in its Covid-19 response."
In a report co-authored with academics from Dublin's Trinity College, the commission said that "parliamentary 
oversight of Ireland's emergency legislation has been lacking."
On Tuesday the government announced that a third lockdown, imposed in late December to stem what became 
a record-breaking spike in novel coronavirus cases, will be extended until at least April 5.
While not giving any end date for restrictions, Prime Minister Micheal Martin said "the end is in truly in sight," citing 
vaccinations.
The commission, an independent public body, said that the government's "making and presentation of regulations 
raises serious rule-of-law concerns."
Sinead Gibney, the chief commissioner, criticized "the systems that implement and scrutinize these decisions," 
while Trinity College's Oran Doyle accused the government of blurring legal obligations and public health advice.
Ireland's police said last week around 8,000 fines had been issued for alleged breaches of the restrictions. The 
commission said "public health guidance" should not be enforced "as if it were law."
Ireland's pandemic restrictions are among the harshest anywhere, according to a University of Oxford 
database. Non-essential travel is limited to within 5 kilometres of a person's home, most pubs have been closed 
since March last year, and public religious services are banned.
Airline Ryanair last year lost a court case challenging the government's travel restrictions. A case filed against the 
worship ban was adjourned for a fourth time this week.

airport 
plunged to an annual 2bn loss in 2020 as the pandemic closed borders and the government restricted most 
international travel, underlining the impact of Covid-19 on aviation.Britain's largest airport said the number of 
passengers who passed through slumped to 22.1 million last year, more than half of whom travelled in January and 
February, a fall of 73% compared with a year earlier and the smallest annual total since 1975. Cargo volumes also 
fell by 28% during 2020, although some dedicated cargo flights helped the airport to offset some of the lost 
passenger travel. 
However, Heathrow's chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said he thought it was 'very likely' that people would be 
able to go on summer holidays, following the prime minister's plan to allow international travel to resume from 17 
May, as part of the government's roadmap out of lockdown. 'For the aviation sector we can start to plan ahead for 
17 May to make sure we've got the people and the planes in place so that we can not just get people on their 
holidays but also get British businesses moving again,' Holland-Kaye told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 
Heathrow said it had acted quickly last year as coronavirus surged to cut its operating costs by slashing pay, 
closing one runway and two terminals, and raising money but warned that airports had very high fixed costs. 
Heathrow complained that government policies had effectively closed borders but that it had received no 
government support other than furlough. It said it had not benefited from business rates relief, unlike other airports, 
as well as retail, hospitality and leisure businesses. The airport is calling on the UK government to provide more 
support to the aviation sector in the March budget and is requesting 100% business rates relief, a further extension 
of the furlough scheme and a reversal of the tourist tax. The company has warned that Britain's economic recovery 
will be held back until long-haul passenger flights can restart, including to key markets such as the US. Airlines and 
travel companies reported a surge in holiday bookings on Tuesday, after Boris Johnson's announcement about 
England's roadmap for the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Companies including EasyJet, Ryanair, Tui and 
Thomas Cook said there had been a jump in bookings to destinations including Spain and Greece after the prime 
minister's announcement, although this remains subject to review. The green light for international travel is also 
dependent on the continued success of the vaccination programme and no resurgence in coronavirus cases. Read

Investors - and possibly also holidaymakers by implication - are being too optimistic about a recovery in air travel in 
2021, analysts at Citigroup have warned.
"We remain startled by the complacency priced into the European airline share prices," the analysts said in a note 
on Tuesday, the morning after Boris Johnson's speech about Britain's planned 'roadmap' out of the current 
coronavirus lockdown.
Prices of airlines appear to be hoping for the European short haul leisure market to deliver more than 50% of levels 
of supply seen in 2019 this summer (2021), the Citi number crunchers said.
"We are decidedly more downbeat," they buzzkilled, throwing considerable shade over the holidaymakers that had 
contributed to rocketing increases in flight and holiday bookings reported on the same morning by the likes of 
easyJet (LON:EZJ), TUI (LON:TUI).
The recovery of demand will, they reckon, be "splintered and truncated", with cash burn for the airlines seen 
persisting "to greater levels than expected" and the industry's cash calls via debt and equity issues "will remain a 
theme".
The analysts said, therefore, pair trades, where a long position is matched with a short position in a closely related 
stock, is "still in our view the sensible strategy for investors in this sector".
Citi sees the most challenged names as EasyJet (LON:EZJ), German's Lufthansa and the Franco-Dutch carrier Air 
France-KLM.
Meanwhile, the travel team have 'buy' ratings on those airlines seen as less operationally geared, namely Ryanair 
(LON:RYA), Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) and British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:IAG).

S7 Airlines (S7, Novosibirsk) has taken delivery of B737-800(BCF) VP-BEN (msn 33545), its first-ever dedicated 
freighter. According to Flightradar24 ADS-B data, it arrived at Moscow Domodedovo from Ostrava on February 18. 
The ch-aviation fleets history module shows the 18.3-year-old Boeing narrowbody was delivered to Ryanair (FR, 
Dublin Int'l) in 2002 and remained there until 2019 when it was withdrawn from passenger service. It subsequently 
underwent P2F-conversion in China in 2020 before being returned to Europe earlier this year. 
"With the delivery of the first Boeing 737-800BCF, a new phase in the development of S7 Airlines cargo 
transportation segment begins. The airline sees serious prospects in this area against the background of a rapid 
development in e-commerce demand. We plan to use it on medium-haul routes, where we have noted a lack of 
capacity in the luggage and cargo compartments of passenger aircraft in relation to demand," Ilya Yaroslavtsev, 
CEO of S7 Cargo, said in a statement. VP-BEN's first flights are planned for the end of February from Moscow to 
Norilsk and Yakutsk. After that, it will be used to connect Moscow and Novosibirsk to Russia's northern and Far 
Eastern districts, including Mirnyj and Vladivostok as well as Frankfurt Int'l in Germany. S7 is expecting a second 
B737-800(BCF) to arrive as per a contract signed with GECAS in August last year.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will appeal against two rulings issued on February 17 at the General Court of the 
European Union, the second-highest court in Europe, in which state aid for Air France (AF, Paris CDG) and SAS 
Scandinavian Airlines (SK, Copenhagen Kastrup) was judged not to have broken state aid rules. The low-cost 
carrier will now take its fight against subsidies for airlines - in these cases a French airport tax deferral and a 
Swedish loan guarantee - to the supreme court, the European Court of Justice, it protested in a statement. The 
measures were introduced at the beginning of the current crisis "with nationality conditions," Ryanair argued, the 
French scheme being reserved for French-registered airlines, the Swedish scheme for Swedish-registered carriers. 
This excluded "all other EU airlines, which were also damaged by Covid-19, despite their contribution to 
connectivity, jobs, traffic growth and the wider economy in France and Sweden," Ryanair said. It launched cases 
against the European Commission's approvals of the schemes in May 2020. "One of the EU's greatest 
achievements is the creation of a true single market for air transport, underpinned by the principle of a common EU 
airline licence - one for each airline. A nationality condition in a state aid scheme is plainly incompatible with the 
single market," the airline said. "We hope that the Court of Justice will overturn the European Commission's 
approvals of the French and Swedish schemes, to give airlines and consumers a glimmer of hope that national 
politicians obsessed with their flag carriers will be sent back to the drawing board and required to use state aid 
wisely [...] instead of bailing out their favoured airline." Ryanair has also appealed at the European level to 
challenge state aid given by countries to Finnair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa, and TAP Air Portugal as 
well as Air France and SAS. The General Court said in one of its rulings that extending France's tax deferral to non-
French companies "would not, by contrast, have made it possible to achieve the objective of making good the 
economic damage suffered by the airlines operating in France in so precise a manner and without a risk of 
overcompensation." The Swedish scheme, meanwhile, which "is appropriate for achieving the objective of 
remedying the serious disturbance in Sweden's economy," according to the court, was also "presumed to have 
been adopted in the interest of the European Union."

ASL Aviation Holdings has firmed options for ten B737-800(BCF)s, increasing its total order for the converted 
freighters to 21 aircraft. The Irish holding placed an initial order for ten B737-800(BCF)s with options for ten more in 
2019. On top of this recent firm order, it also ordered another one aircraft in the meanwhile. "The performance and 
reliability of the B737-800BCF make it the perfect fit for our combined fleet renewal and growth programmes and so 
we have moved to confirm our 10 options earlier than planned", Chief Executive Dave Andrew said. 
The holding said that the newly ordered aircraft will be operated by its in-house carriers: ASL Airlines Ireland, ASL 
Airlines Belgium, and ASL Airlines France. The first B737-800(BCF) was delivered to ASL Airlines France in late 
November 2020 and entered into revenue service on December 9. The ex-Pegasus Airlines and ex-Ryanair 
narrowbody was converted by Taikoo (Shandong) Aircraft Engineering Co. Ltd at Jinan airport. ASL's second B737-
800(BCF) is due for delivery by the end of February 2021 to the group's Thai joint-venture, K-Mile Air (8K, Bangkok 
Suvarnabhumi). ASL said that a further four B737-800s are currently under conversion while another two are 
expected to be inducted for conversion "in the coming weeks". Besides the 21 direct-order B737-800(BCF)s, ASL 
Aviation Holdings also dry-leases two units of the type, currently operated by ASL Airlines Ireland for Amazon.com, 
from GECAS, the ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows.

A top EU court has rejected Ryanair's legal challenge to state aid given to rival airlines during the pandemic in a 
victory for the 27-member bloc.
Judges at the General Court said the support, cleared by the European Commission, was not discriminatory.
The court said a French state aid scheme was "appropriate for making good the economic damage caused by the 
Covid-19 pandemic and does not constitute discrimination". A Swedish scheme, the court said, was also "in the 
interest" of the bloc.
The budget carrier said it would appeal. "Now is the time for the European Commission to stop caving in to national 
governments' inefficient bailout policies and start protecting the single market, Europe's greatest asset for future 
economic recovery," Ryanair said in a statement.
Brussels said the schemes "do not constitute a breach of the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of 
nationality, nor do they involve an unjustified restriction on the freedom to provide services".
Ryanair, which accessed £600m from the UK's Covid Corporate Financing Facility, has filed 16 cases to test the 
state aid rules. It argues that (EURO)30bn "gifted to EU flag carriers" undermines the EU's single market in air 
travel. Javier Espinoza and Philip Georgiadis

Highlight: Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair has revealed plans to appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union 
(EU) over the EU's rulings for state aid benefiting flag carrier airlines.
Body
The move follows after the airline lost its fight against government bailouts granted to Air France and Scandinavia's 
SAS. Ryanair alleged that the EU Court's rulings on French and Swedish State aid schemes favoured the state-
owned airlines over all other EU airlines. 
The General Court of the EU ruled that the state bailouts awarded by the French and Swedish governments did not 
breach state-aid rules. Ryanair has been protesting (EURO)30bn in aid given to EU flag carriers during the Covid-
19 pandemic. A Ryanair spokesperson said: "Ryanair is a truly European airline. We have no rich and powerful 
'home country' to subsidise us in times of trouble. Nor do we want discriminatory aid. "During the Covid-19 
pandemic over (EURO)30bn in discriminatory state subsidies has been gifted to EU flag carriers and, if allowed to 
stand, this will distort the level playing field in EU aviation for decades to come, giving chronically inefficient national 
airlines a leg-up on their efficient low-fare competitors. "We hope that the Court of Justice will overturn the 
European Commission's approvals of the French and Swedish schemes, to give airlines and consumers a glimmer 
of hope that national politicians obsessed with their flag carriers will be sent back to the drawing board and required 
to use state aid wisely to assist the recovery of traffic in the post-Covid world instead of bailing out their favoured 
airline at the expense of fair competition and consumers."

https://bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-to-challenge-eu-court-ruling-on-french-and-swedish-state-aid/Ryanair is to 
appeal to the European court of justice after losing the first round of its legal battle against state bailouts granted to 
rival flag carrier airlines such as Air France-KLM and Scandinavia's SAS during the Covid-19 pandemic.Michael 
O'Leary, the chief executive of the Irish airline, had accused nation states of 'selectively gifting billions of euros to 
their inefficient flag carriers'. Ryanair has filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the European commission and 
various airlines over state-aid grants by European governments. 
However, on Wednesday the Luxembourg-based general court ruled that state bailouts awarded by the French and 
Swedish governments - and approved by the European commission - were in line with the bloc's rules. 'That aid 
scheme is appropriate for making good the economic damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and does not 
constitute discrimination,' the court said, referring to the French scheme. Regarding the Swedish scheme, the court 
said: 'The scheme at issue is presumed to have been adopted in the interest of the European Union.' Ryanair had 
taken issue with the European commission for clearing a French scheme allowing airlines to defer certain 
aeronautical taxes and Sweden's loan guarantee scheme for airlines. Both schemes benefited their flag carriers. 
Ryanair has filed 16 lawsuits against the commission for allowing state aid to individual airlines including Lufthansa, 
KLM, Austrian Airlines and Portugal's TAP, as well as national government schemes that mainly benefit flag 
carriers. Europe's biggest budget carrier said it would appeal the rulings at the EU's top court, arguing that the 
French and Swedish programs mainly benefited Air France-KLM and SAS AB and unfairly discriminated against 
other European carriers. Ultimate victory would 'give airlines and consumers a glimmer of hope that national 
politicians obsessed with their flag carriers will be sent back to the drawing board and required to use state aid 
wisely to assist the recovery of traffic in the post-Covid world instead of bailing out their favoured airline at the 
expense of fair competition and consumers', Ryanair said on Wednesday. O'Leary has previously said: 'These are 
the crack-cocaine junkies of the state-aid world because their first instinct is to always go to the government for 
state aid. We believe that any state aid in this crisis should be transparent and provided to everybody.' Read more:

In a blow to Ryanair, EU court approves state help measures

BRUSSELS (AP) — A top court has ruled that measures introduced by France and Sweden to help some airlines 
weather the fallout of coronavirus restrictions are compatible with European Union law, dealing a major blow to low-
cost carrier Ryanair which challenged them as unfair.
The General Court of the European Union handed down two decisions Wednesday. It said a system introduced by 
France to defer tax payments for airlines holding a French operating license “does not constitute discrimination.”
The Luxembourg-based court also ruled that a loan guarantee scheme put in place last year by Sweden to support 
airlines with a Swedish operating license “is presumed to have been adopted in the interest of the European Union.”
The EU’s executive arm, the European Commission, which polices state aid and other competition issues, 
approved the two plans last year, weeks after the pandemic began spreading throughout Europe and border 
closures and other restrictions hit air travel.
Ryanair which says it was transporting around 149 million passengers a year before the coronavirus hit, went to 
court to have that approval annulled, arguing that the schemes constitute unfair state aid bailouts for national 
carriers.
The private company headquartered in Ireland plans to appeal Wednesday’s ruling at Europe’s highest court, the 
European Court of Justice.
It said that during the pandemic more than 30 billion euros ($36 billion) “in discriminatory State subsidies has been 
gifted to EU flag carriers and, if allowed to stand, this will distort the level playing field in EU aviation for decades to 
come, giving chronically inefficient national airlines a leg up on their efficient low-fare competitors.”
The decisions come as the 27 EU member countries ponder how long to continue to provide support to businesses 
and economies to help them survive the impact of coronavirus restrictions amid concerns that some companies are 
gaining an unfair advantage through state help.

flight from Atlanta to Boston on Sunday.
According to WCVB Boston, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and FBI are investigating the incident after 
the unidentified man had to be subdued with zip ties for the remainder of the flight.
"I saw the stewardess in first class, it seemed like she jumped back. I learned she had been hit," passenger Mark 
French told WCVB. "I stuck my head up and pulled off my headphones, and she was yelling, saying, 'He's trying to 
open the door.'"
According to the witness, a pair of officers with badges stepped in and were eventually able to hold the man down 
until the flight landed at Boston Logan International Airport, where it was met by law enforcement.
"They were having a hard time subduing him, so I jumped out of my seat. They were both saying, you know, 'We 
need a belt. We need something for handcuffs.' I started yelling at the passengers, 'I need a belt!' Another lady in 
first class gave me her belt," French added. "Basically the remainder of the flight, he was just screaming, 'Let me 
out of here, this isn't my home.'"
Delta confirmed that the police presence upon the flight's arrival was "due to a disruptive customer on board."
Last month, a Ryanair passenger pleaded guilty to several charges after refusing to wear a face mask 
and drunkenly headbutting a flight attendant on a flight from Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, to Manchester, 
England.

Ryanair, easyJet and Wizz Air's results for calendar 4Q2020 were not pleasant. The three LCCs have performed 
better than Europe's leading legacy airline groups in the COVID-19 pandemic, so their results provide an upper 
boundary for the likely performance of the legacies when they report.
Revenue decline for the three LCCs accelerated from 3Q2020, with easyJet suffering the heaviest drop. All of them 
improved ancillary revenue as a share of the total in 4Q2020, but easyJet is the weakest of the three in this area.
All three are operating minimal capacity while travel restrictions remain tight across Europe, focusing only on cash-
generative operations. However, all expect market share gains when demand recovers.
The recovery should present all three with opportunities, although Ryanair and Wizz Air's more aggressive growth 
plans and lower unit costs may give them an advantage over easyJet.
EasyJet CEO Johan Lundgren will be interviewed on CAPA Live on 10-Feb-2020, and can be expected to be a 
strong advocate of his airline's strategic position.
Summary:
In calendar 4Q2020, passenger numbers were down by 87% for easyJet and by 77% for Ryanair and Wizz Air. 
Load factor fell by more than 25ppts for all.
Revenue decline accelerated from 3Q2020; easyJet revenue fell most heavily. All made progress with ancillary 
revenue in 4Q2020, but easyJet is weakest.
Aggregate operating losses were higher than combined revenues in the quarter, but all three have healthy liquidity.

Ryanair to appeal EU court rulings on Air France and SAS state aid

Ryanair has responded to the EU Court's rulings on French and Swedish State aid schemes favouring Air France 
and SAS over all other EU airlines.  The French airport tax deferral and the Swedish loan guarantee were 
introduced at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis with nationality conditions.  The French scheme was reserved 
for French registered airlines and the Swedish scheme to Swedish registered airlines, while excluding all other EU 
airlines, which were also damaged by COVID-19, despite their contribution to connectivity, jobs, traffic growth and 
the wider economy in France and Sweden.  Ryanair appealed the European Commission's approvals of these 
schemes to the EU General Court in May 2020.  Following today's rulings, Ryanair will now refer these matters to 
the Court of Justice of the EU.
Ryanair's spokesperson said: "One of the EU's greatest achievements is the creation of a true single market for air 
transport, underpinned by the principle of a common EU airline licence - one for each airline.  A nationality condition 
in a State aid scheme is plainly incompatible with the single market.
Ryanair is a truly European airline.  We have no rich and powerful 'home country' to subsidise us in times of 
trouble.  Nor do we want discriminatory aid.  Our instinct in a crisis is to seek efficiencies and cost savings, to offer 
more routes at lower fares - while remaining Europe's greenest airline.
During the COVID-19 pandemic over (EURO)30bn in discriminatory State subsidies has been gifted to EU flag 
carriers and, if allowed to stand, this will distort the level playing field in EU aviation for decades to come, giving 
chronically inefficient national airlines a leg up on their efficient low-fare competitors.
We hope that the Court of Justice will overturn the European Commission's approvals of the French and Swedish 
schemes, to give airlines and consumers a glimmer of hope that national politicians obsessed with their flag carriers 
will be sent back to the drawing board and required to use State aid wisely to assist the recovery of traffic in the 
post-COVID world instead of bailing out their favoured airline at the expense of fair competition and consumers.  
Now is the time for the European Commission to stop caving into national governments' inefficient bail-out policies 
and start protecting the single market, Europe's greatest asset for future economic recovery."

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) said it will appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union a decision by an EU 
court ruling that French and Swedish funding programs for Air France (AIRF.PA) and SAS (SAS.ST) did not breach 
the bloc's rules.
The European Commission approved France's aviation tax payments deferral for companies with a French license, 
while it also gave the green light to Sweden's loan guarantees for locally based airlines.
Ryanair said more than 30 billion euros ($36.19 billion) in "discriminatory" state subsidies were granted to EU flag 
carriers, which would "distort the level playing field in EU aviation for decades to come, giving chronically inefficient 
national airlines a leg up on their efficient low-fare competitors."

countries. The fight could still go further.Ryanair on Wednesday lost a legal fight in the European Union's second 
court against state aid being granted to pandemic-hit rivals Air France and Sweden 's SAS through national 
schemes.Judges at the EU's General Court in Luxembourg backed EU competition regulators who had allowed the

aeronautical taxes, and to rule on Sweden's loan guarantee scheme for airlines.Ryanair has pursued a legal 
campaign across Europe to stop the bailouts, arguing the state aid gives an unfair advantage to prestigious national 
flag carriers.What did the court say?"This aid scheme is appropriate to remedy the economic damage caused by 
the COVID-19 pandemic and does not constitute discrimination," the court said, referring to the French scheme.It 
also said the Swedish scheme was compatible with EU laws. The court said that the limitation of the loan guarantee 
scheme "is appropriate for achieving the objective of remedying the serious disturbance in Sweden's 
economy."What can the Irish airline do now?The losses for Ryanair were just a first round, and the cases could now

Feb 17, 2021( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  BRUSSELS (AP)   A top court has 
ruled that measures introduced by France and Sweden to help some airlines weather the fallout of coronavirus 
restrictions are compatible with European Union law, dealing a major blow to low-cost carrier Ryanair which 
challenged them as unfair. The General Court of the European Union handed down two decisions Wednesday. It 
said a system introduced by France to defer tax payments for airlines holding a French operating license 'does not 
constitute discrimination.' 
The Luxembourg-based court also ruled that a loan guarantee scheme put in place last year by Sweden to support 
airlines with a Swedish operating license 'is presumed to have been adopted in the interest of the European Union.' 
The EU's executive arm, the European Commission, which polices state aid and other competition issues, 
approved the two plans last year, weeks after the pandemic began spreading throughout Europe and border 
closures and other restrictions hit air travel. Ryanair which says it was transporting around 149 million passengers a 
year before the coronavirus hit, went to court to have that approval annulled, arguing that the schemes constitute 
unfair state aid bailouts for national carriers. The private company headquartered in Ireland plans to appeal 
Wednesday's ruling at Europe's highest court, the European Court of Justice. It said that during the pandemic more 
than 30 billion euros ($36 billion) 'in discriminatory State subsidies has been gifted to EU flag carriers and, if 
allowed to stand, this will distort the level playing field in EU aviation for decades to come, giving chronically 
inefficient national airlines a leg up on their efficient low-fare competitors.' The decisions come as the 27 EU 
member countries ponder how long to continue to provide support to businesses and economies to help them 
survive the impact of coronavirus restrictions amid concerns that some companies are gaining an unfair advantage 
through state help. (Ad) The firm that called the Exact Peak of the Dot-Com boom has just issued another major

MAAS Aviation, recognised experts in aircraft painting and exterior coatings, has opened a new purpose-built paint 
shop at Kaunas Airport (KUN).  The facility, which is the first of its kind in Lithuania, grows MAAS Aviation's global 
footprint to eleven best-in-class paint shops and increases their overall MRO capacity in Europe by 40%. Designed 
to achieve the highest industry quality standards, the facility features the very latest technologies, including systems 
to ensure safe and secure operations and to manage the environmental impact of the Company's activities.
Following a multi-million Euro investment by MAAS Aviation, the ultra-modern Lithuanian facility is a twin-bay 
narrow body paint shop capable of accommodating up to two A321 sized aircraft simultaneously.  All MAAS 
Aviation facilities are certified to EN9100, ISO9001 and ISO14001 standards and the Kaunas shop will operate to 
these standards from the outset.
According to Tim Macdougald, CEO of MAAS Aviation, the central/eastern European location of Kaunas was 
chosen as a result of several influencing factors. "It was the universal willingness of the Lithuanian authorities to 
bring a new industry to Lithuania" says Macdougald. "I'd particularly like to mention Invest Lithuania and the Airport 
Authority of Lithuania for supporting a project that spearheads the development of aviation services at Kaunas; and 
to FL Technics for committing to build a partnership with MAAS to combine our services with theirs for the benefit of 
airline and lease company customers; and to Ryanair for its continued business and trust in being our launch 
customer at the site."
In the build up to establishing this new facility MAAS Aviation experienced a dynamic growth trajectory. In 2015 the 
Company had just three paint shops in two locations, 130 aircraft were painted, and turnover was approximately 
US$10 million.
This year MAAS will have eleven paint shops (three in Hamburg; two in Kaunas; two in Maastricht; one at Fokker 
Woensdrecht; and three in Mobile, Alabama. The organisation is forecasting painting up to 300 aircraft with turnover 
expected to exceed US$28 million.
"All MAAS paint shops are operated to OEM standards of performance and we are one of the top three MROs in 
the world offering a specialist service", explains Macdougald.  "Our business benefits from long term customer 
contracts - including with Airbus - all of which relate to our culture which combines integrity with competence and

reliability. The standard of our facilities reflects our design expertise and includes full climate control paint shops, 
computerised building management systems and datalogging, high-lux lighting, and fully-lined clean paint shops. 
Our use of aircraft access docking systems eliminates the risk of damaging aircraft during painting due to the 
avoidance of moving equipment."
MAAS Aviation mitigated the impact of COVID-19 on the construction of the paint shop facility at Kaunas Airport 
early. "It is testament to the quality of our design team headed by Ian Guinness of MRO Facilities International, and 
of our project management & construction contractors - UAB Agentus and UAB TEC" emphasises Macdougald. 
"The 'can do' mind-set of the local people also contributed to this positive result. As a result, the build completed 
exactly on time, to budget. Our professional team spearheaded by Cobalt Law ensured the project ran smoothly 
from a legal and contractual perspective throughout and I would like to make a special mention of their 
contribution."
The 40% increase in MAAS Aviation's European MRO capacity enables the Company to capture more business 
during the peak seasons. Macdougald continues, "Our partnership with FL Technics will combine our services for 
the benefit of airline and leasing company customers - together we will offer an outstanding aircraft redelivery 
centre-of-excellence at Kaunas Airport."

Johan Lundgren wasted no time in dashing off a letter of complaint when a UK government minister recently 
warned it was too early even to think about booking a summer break.
The exasperation from Lundgren, the chief executive of easyJet, Europe's second-biggest low-cost carrier, is 
understandable because the stakes are so high for an airline industry whose hopes for a vaccine-led recovery this 
year are already in jeopardy.
The pandemic shut the skies abruptly last spring, bludgeoning the industry as it endured the largest decline in flying 
since the second world war. Less than two months into this year, the danger facing airlines is more akin to a slow 
strangulation as country by country travel restrictions are tightened and, in some cases, borders closed to prevent 
new variants of Covid-19 spreading.
For an $800bn industry built on moving people around, it is an alarming picture. Europe and the US have tightened 
travel restrictions; the UK introduced tougher quarantine rules yesterday while Australia's borders are expected to 
stay closed until the end of the year.
Border clampdowns stall airlines' hopes of a vaccine-led recovery Travel curbs imposed to combat new Covid 
variants threaten to strangle $800bn industry
"Ever changing travel restrictions like quarantines are the single biggest barrier to customer bookings," Lundgren 
told the Financial Times.
Andrew Charlton, an aviation consultant, puts it bluntly: "The countries that have been really good at suppressing 
the virus have done it by killing international aviation."
New Zealand is among the nations to have pursued such an approach - its flagship airline carried just 6,000 
longhaul passengers in December. Even as vaccines continue to offer a long-term solution to Covid-19 - and most 
carriers still believe that this year will ultimately be better than last - signs of the renewed pressures are multiplying.
The number of flights in European airspace has this month plunged to the lowest level since the first strict 
lockdowns were imposed last spring. Despite a domestic airline market buoyed by an economic recovery, China's 
recovery has faltered as Beijing discouraged travel over the lunar new year.
Carriers have slashed their already meagre ambitions for the first quarter, with easyJet and rival Ryanair expecting 
to fly just 10 per cent of their normal schedules.
In a sign of how the pandemic is again confounding the industry's expectations, the International Air Transport 
Association, which represents airlines globally, admitted there was a growing risk passenger numbers for this year 
would fall short of its projections. "We had been basing our forecasts on governments being able and willing to start 
lowering travel restrictions once the vulnerable part of the population has been vaccinated," said Brian Pearce, 
Iata's chief economist. "I think what we have seen in recent weeks is governments taking a much, much tougher, 
more cautious approach."
With the outlook for carriers appearing to grow more fraught by the day, the ramifications run far deeper than 
ripping up passenger forecasts. Texas-based American Airlines this month warned 13,000 of its employees were at 
risk of furlough, blaming new restrictions on international travel and slow vaccine distribution.
"We fully believed that we would be looking at a summer schedule where we'd fly all of our aeroplanes and need 
the full strength of our team," Doug Parker, chief executive, said in a note to staff. "Regrettably, that is no longer the 
case."
The measured language from the American Airlines chief sugarcoats the pain carriers have faced from having 
expectations repeatedly dashed.
Tony Douglas, chief executive of the Gulf carrier Etihad, said he had been hoping for a rebound in passenger 
numbers by the second half of the year, but "almost every time we revisit what's going on it changes".
For European airlines in particular, the prospect of mass vaccinations unleashing a surge in summer bookings was 
seen as key to repairing their balance sheets. "Summer is crucial, it is really critical" for European carriers, said 
Geoffrey Weston, a partner at consultancy Bain.
The region's five biggest carriers - Ryanair, British Airways owner IAG, Lufthansa, Wizz Air and easyJet - have 
already raised about $20bn from governments, shareholders and bond markets to help them withstand the crisis. 
Analysts at Bernstein reckon that in the event of the worst-case scenario with little flying over the summer, only 
Wizz is likely to avoid having to raise more money.
While the slow rollout of jabs in some countries has dimmed the chances of a firm rebound in international travel, 
the new enemy for airlines this year is more concerning: the spread of new Covid-19 variants that may be more 
resistant to the current stable of vaccines.
A small trial that found the Oxford/ AstraZeneca vaccine might be less effective at stopping milder and moderate 
cases of the variant first detected in South Africa only added to the pressure on the UK government to introduce the 
tougher travel restrictions that started yesterday.
Border clampdowns stall airlines' hopes of a vaccine-led recovery Travel curbs imposed to combat new Covid 
variants threaten to strangle $800bn industry
It also complicates any attempt to achieve international co-ordination on travel rules between governments, 
something airline executives have long believed is necessary for a resumption of air travel on any scale.
Sweden and Denmark said they would offer digital coronavirus passports by the summer to help create 
international standards around certifying people as fit to travel.
Beyond this, airlines have largely been left to develop their own solutions, working together to develop digital health 
passports that would provide certification of negative virus tests and vaccinations But Wizz Air's chief executive 
József Váradi acknowledges that "at this point in time, as an industry we do not own our own destiny, we are 
focused on political decisions". If governments are growing more focused on safeguarding their borders, 
shareholders have not given up on a rebound in passenger numbers this year. Airline stocks have largely preserved 
gains made since November when many of the main vaccine developers revealed their jabs were effective.
And like other airline chiefs, Lundgren of easyJet has not given up hope. "We have set ourselves up so we can take 
decisions as late as possible" on how many planes to fly over Easter and the early summer, he said.
When the recovery does arrive, the low-cost carriers may be best placed to capitalise as their short-haul businesses 
bounce back quicker than the long-haul that legacy European groups such as IAG and Air France-KLM rely on.
In the US, the big carriers all predict a slower recovery in long-haul international travel than domestic. Its large 
domestic market at least offers operators a cushion not available to European long-haul specialists.
For an industry whose lifeblood is open borders, 2021 has already provided a reminder that any restoration of that 
remains a long way off.
"There isn't anybody who could smile inside and think 'I am in a better place than the competitors'," said Douglas of 
Etihad. "Realistically, everybody is exposed."

After Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) reiterated its opposition to any further state aid to Air France (AF, Paris CDG), 
French Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari has hit back and said that any conditions imposed by the 
European Commission should entail reforms to eliminate opportunities for low-cost carriers to "distort the market". 
In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Djebbari, who is himself a licenced pilot, pointed in particular to LCC's 
employment practices, namely hiring cabin crew and pilots as independent contractors rather than as full-time 
salaried staff. "During the last ten years, we didn't regulate the aviation sector from a social point of view. We still 
have some low-cost carriers well-positioned for recovery from the COVID era that use independent workers," he 
said. 
Djebbari underlined that plans for the further recapitalisation of Air France have not yet been firmed. Last year, the 
French carrier received a EUR7 billion euro (USD8.4 billion) bailout, of which EUR3 billion (USD3.6 billion) was a 
direct loan from the government, and the remainder was in state guarantees for commercial loans. According to 
recent media reports, the state is now contemplating converting the loan into repayable hybrid bonds due to the 
protracted effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. That would be considered an equity injection under European Union 
state aid rules. As a new form of state aid, even though the actual amount available to the airline will not increase, 
the conversion would need to be approved by the European Commission. Ryanair has been vehement in its 
opposition to any form of state bailouts to flag carriers in the EU. In the case of Air France, the Irish LCC said that at 
the very least, the airline should be required to rescind some of its slots at Paris Orly. "Should yet another 
enormous and illegal state aid bailout occur, then effective remedies must be applied to ensure fair competition in 
the French market and to protect the interests of the French consumer/visitor," Ryanair said in a statement. 
Djebbari also rejected comparisons with Lufthansa (LH, Frankfurt Int'l) which was last year forced by the European 
Commission to relinquish 12 slot pairs at each of Frankfurt Int'l and Munich airports in return for its EUR9 billion 
euro (USD10.9 billion) aid package. "We want something proportionate that addresses not only competition but the 
social reality of the sector," he underlined. Djebbari added that the French ministries were in talks with their Dutch 
counterparts to coordinate more aid to Air France with decisions regarding its sister carrier KLM Royal Dutch 
Airlines (KL, Amsterdam Schiphol).

According to Boeing, January was one of its best months in recent times as it delivered 26 aircraft, including 21 737 
MAX jets. Many agencies have already approved the resumption of 737 MAX, and the aircraft manufacturer can 
finally start clearing its backlog of more than 400 built but undelivered aircraft.
Out of the 21 737 MAX deliveries, 12 went to US carriers: five to American, five to United, and two to Alaska. The 
rest went to customers outside of North America: one to CDB Aviation in Hong Kong, two to Copa Airlines in 
Panama, and six to SMBC Aviation Capital in Ireland.
Alaska Airlines will start flying the jet for the first time on 1 March and its executives are extremely optimistic about 
it:
"We've eagerly waited for this day. It was a proud moment to board our newest 737 aircraft and fly it home," said 
Alaska Airlines President Ben Minicucci.
SMBC is a leasing company with various customers worldwide, such as Ryanair, Aeromexico, Sunwing, and more. 
Southwest is also one of them, and, according to media reports, the six lessor's 737 MAXs went to the US budget 
carrier.
It seems that Boeing is getting back on track after a disastrous previous year when the company reported a record 
US$12 billion loss. The return of 737 MAX is also crucial for airlines as they are looking to be cost-efficient, 
especially while emerging from the crisis.

Vaccinations mean vacations, at least for some of us

The travel industry is optimistic about vaccinations unlocking vacations. The UK government is doing its best to kill 
the buzz.
"At the moment," says Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary, "bookings have essentially collapsed. Nobody is 
flying up to Easter." But he forecasts a rapid improvement, with a back-ofthe-envelope estimate for April flights at 
10 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, 20 per cent in May, 30-40 per cent in June and 50 per cent for July to 
September.
Yet a television ad from Ryanair that encouraged viewers to "Jab and go!" was last week banned by the UK's 
Advertising Standards Authority, partly on the rationale that viewers would jam up doctors' phone lines demanding 
an injection before they headed to the airport.
Having done little to stop the virus entering the UK for most of the pandemic, the government is now forcing 
travellers arriving from 33 countries to spend 10 days locked up in a hotel or risk 10 years locked up in jail. Any 
other arrivals must quarantine at home and be tested.
A government that introduced a dining scheme that exhorted people to "eat out to help out" earlier in the crisis now 
warns them against booking refundable holidays six months in advance. "Please don't go and book holidays for 
something that is illegal to do, whether it's here or abroad," the transport secretary said this week.
Vaccinations mean vacations, at least for some of us
Yet however dire the current situation, companies and many tourists are looking at a successful vaccine rollout and 
expecting the rules will be relaxed before the summer.
Tui, Europe's largest travel group, this week reported that more than half of its 2.8m summer bookings had come 
from the UK. "It's our strongest market and also the market with the best vaccination programme," chief executive 
Friedrich Joussen told analysts. "That's all good."
This phenomenon exists in other fedup northern hemisphere countries. US budget carrier JetBlue forecast last 
week that its full-year capacity would recover to 70 per cent of 2019 levels. Spirit Airlines said on Thursday that it 
expected to be back to 2019 levels by the summer.
Payments companies are hopeful too. Predicting 19 per cent revenue growth in 2021, PayPal highlighted travel as 
a particular driver as soon as the second quarter. "As people begin receiving vaccines, there's pent-up demand," 
said CFO John Rainey. "People want to take that summer vacation that they missed in 2020."
Will governments try to stop them? Subdued populations, frightened by the winter increase in cases and deaths, 
have tolerated lengthy lockdowns. That is unlikely to persist for long after the March anniversary of widespread 
restrictions.
As O'Leary, head of Europe's largest airline, puts it: "If the UK has everyone over 65 vaccinated by the end of 
March, most of Europe by the end of May, there will be extraordinary resistance among populations to being ... told 
you can't travel abroad."
There is one wrinkle. Ryanair's banned advert showed a bunch of young adults jumping into a pool. But few 
countries will have fully vaccinated this group by the summer.
If countries are willing to accept unvaccinated tourists, that should not matter. But if vaccines become mandatory, 
then only older people will be travelling in the short term. That would mean a grey summer after all.

Boeing reported that Boeing 737 MAX 10 would reach its first customers no earlier than in 2023, which is a two-
year delay from the original plan. The smallest narrowbody, the 737 MAX 7, will start being this year 2021, although 
initially it was due in 2020.
"We now appreciate that the first 737 MAX 10 and 777X delivery will occur in 2023. This schedule reflects a number 
of factors, including an updated assessment of global certification requirement informed by continues discussion 
with regulators and resulting in a management decision to make modifications to the aircraft's design," Boeing 
stated.
The customers who want to incorporate Boeing 737 MAX 10 into their fleets are the American United Airlines and 
the Vietnamese VietJet. United would like to receive 100 aircraft, whereas VietJet has placed orders for 80. A 
number of European airlines are also keeping an eye on the newest 737 MAX models, the most significant 
customer being Ryanair. When the carrier was signing a deal for a further Boeing 737 MAX 200 airplanes, CEO 
Michael O'Leary mentioned the company might be looking to invest in the biggest variant in the future.

Travel bosses warn of ruined summer Holiday advice Industry says caution on bookings flies in the face of

Travel bosses warn of ruined summer; Holiday advice Industry says caution 
on bookings flies in the face of vaccination success

The travel industry has criticised the government after ministers warned it was too soon for Britons to book holidays 
at home or abroad.
Grant Shapps, transport secretary, said yesterday that people should not book holidays internationally or 
domestically until there was a clearer plan for exiting lockdown, due to be announced by Boris Johnson, prime 
minister, this month. People should "do nothing at this stage", he said.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, accused ministers of "posturing" and said there was "almost a hysteria" 
about stopping people from travelling, particularly given the early success of the UK's vaccination programme.
The budget airline boss said the UK could not seal itself off from the world to keep out new variants of Covid-19, 
and that travel should be opened up as soon as the vulnerable had been vaccinated.
"I think there is going to be an unanswerable case to allow people to move freely again," he said. "What's the point 
of a successful vaccination programme if you aren't going to use it to lift restrictions?" Glyn Jones, chief executive of 
Southend airport, said Shapps' comments were the "last thing we need". The summer was "at serious risk".
One executive from a UK holiday provider said: "We don't see, unless something goes wrong, how the government 
can reasonably stop travel in a nation that's mostly vaccinated by May."
Travel bosses warn of ruined summer Holiday advice Industry says caution on bookings flies in the face of 
vaccination success
Holiday companies have reported surging bookings for staycations. Last month Matt Hancock, health secretary, 
said he expected a "great British summer" and that he would be holidaying in Cornwall.
The government is preparing to roll out from Monday tough new quarantine measures for travellers arriving in 
England in an effort to thwart the spread of new variants of Covid-19.
The travel and tourism industry said the latest measures could be ruinous for the summer holiday season and has 
called for a road map out of the increasingly strict restrictions.
Airlines and airports are privately concerned they are still waiting to hear details on how they should deal with 
people arriving from 33 high-risk, or socalled red-list, countries, said two people familiar with the discussions. 
Airports have told the government they do not have enough staff to marshal passengers through terminals and 
have suggested Border Force staff be used.
There is also concern that five days from the quarantine system going live there is no directive on whether to 
segregate passengers from red-list countries, either on planes or at the airports. Direct flights from the high-risk 
countries are banned, meaning passengers will have to mix with people arriving from other countries.

Travel sector players such as Wyndham Hotels, Southwest and Visa will benefit from a recovery in local travel, 
though businesses that rely on international travel may have to wait for demand to return. "The pandemic travel 
recovery will likely be uneven, with leisure flying returning first, followed by business, which bodes well for low-cost 
airlines such as Southwest and Ryanair, and worse for full-service like United and Lufthansa," according to 
Bloomberg.

When the ribbon was cut five years ago to inaugurate the first passenger airport in the region, it was not expected 
that it would reach more than 100,000 passengers so quickly, travelling in so many directions. It was also not 
expected that a global epidemic would soon put it to the test.
Today, celebrating its anniversary on the threshold of 2021 - Olsztyn-Mazury Airport has proudly gained the status 
of one of the best places for safe travel in times of the covid crisis. Although the history of the airport began before 
World War II, it was not until the opening of the Olsztyn-Mazury Airport and the first Sprint Air flight to Berlin on 21 
January 2016, that the aviation infrastructure in the heart of the Warmia-Mazury region began to flourish. Since 
then, flight network has expanded to include Krakow, Wroclaw, Munich, Warsaw, London Luton, London Stansted, 
Oslo, Lviv, Dortmund, Cologne, Bremen and Burgas. At the same time, the number of passengers served grew 
much faster than expected. During the first year, the airport exceeded its initial target by more than 50% and in 
2019 Olsztyn-Mazury was named as the fastest-growing regional airport in Poland. Over the last 5 years, Olsztyn-
Mazury Airport has cooperated with LOT Polish Airlines, Wizz Air, Ryanair, Adria Airways, Bulgarian Air and Small 
Planet.
Currently, Olsztyn-Mazury Airport, now often referred to as Masurian Lakes Airport, serves various types of air 
operations including: passenger flights, charter flights, medical flights, military flights, business flights, General 
Aviation flights, training flights and in the future also cargo operations. It also plays an important role in the defence 
of the country.
This way, the first airport in the north-east of Poland has made the Warmia and Mazury region an important centre 
of air traffic management.
Visit Olsztyn-Mazury Airport and enjoy a safe and comfortable experience.

Liberum lifts Ryanair target on Boeing compensation

Stockbroker Liberum has hiked its target price for Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) by a whole euro, to (EURO)16 
from (EURO)15, but that's not enough for analyst Gerald Khoo to budge the broker's 'hold' recommendation.
Khoo in a note highlighted that the compensation from Boeing, from the 737 MAX safety issues and grounding, has 
helped Ryanair's balance sheet during the pandemic.
The exact compensation terms remain confidential and aren't known, but, Liberum estimates at least 
(EURO)700mln of concessions from Boeing.
"Ryanair's balance sheet and liquidity have benefitted from the compensation from Boeing," Khoo said.
"To put the estimated (EURO)700m into context, Ryanair raised (EURO)400m in its equity placing and 
(EURO)850m in its bond issue, both in September 2020.
"So, while it is not a decisive or critical amount of capital, being only (EURO)0.6 per share and less than 5% of the 
current market capitalisation, it is also not a trivial sum in the context of the fundraises Ryanair has had to execute 
to reinforce its balance sheet in the face of the pandemic."
The analyst added: "Ryanair's balance sheet and liquidity have benefitted from the compensation from Boeing.

Boeing (BOE, Chicago O'Hare) is hoping to complete the certification of its smallest B737 MAX Family variant, the 
B737-7, and commence deliveries of the aircraft this year. However, the largest variant, the B737-10, will not deliver 
before 2023, two years behind the original schedule. "This schedule reflects several factors, including an updated 
assessment of global certification requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and resulting in a 
management decision to make modifications to the aircraft's design," the manufacturer said in its annual report. 
Having completed the recertification of the B737-8 and B737-9 - the two MAX variants that were in service before 
type's grounding in March 2019 - Boeing has now turned to certifying variants which have yet to secure regulatory 
approval. The B737-7 was announced in 2011 and flew for the first time in March 2018. As such, it was close to 
certification when the family was grounded globally. The ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows that Boeing 
currently has 79 firm orders for the type (including four B737-7(BBJ)s) with Southwest Airlines (WN, Dallas Love 
Field) as the largest customer with 30 aircraft due. In turn, the -10 was announced in 2017 in response to Airbus's 
success with the A321-200N and was originally due to start delivering in 2021. Boeing has firm orders for 467 
B737-10s, including 128 from United Airlines (UA, Chicago O'Hare) and 106 from VietJetAir (VJ, Hanoi). The third, 
as-yet-uncertificated, variant of the B737 MAX is the B737-8-200, a modified high-density B737-8 aimed at the low-
cost segment. It is in the final stages of certification and due for initial delivery to Ryanair Holdings later this quarter.

Travel sector players such as Wyndham Hotels, Southwest and Visa will benefit from a recovery in local travel, 
though businesses that rely on international travel may have to wait for demand to return. "The pandemic travel 
recovery will likely be uneven, with leisure flying returning first, followed by business, which bodes well for low-cost 
airlines such as Southwest and Ryanair, and worse for full-service like United and Lufthansa," according to 
Bloomberg.

Feb 05, 2021( Adam Smith Institute Blog: http://www.adamsmith.org/blog Delivered by Newstex)  To leap free from 
an overweening bureaucracy is a benefit but we do then have to be careful about the home grown 
equivalents[1]:Ryanair's spat with the Civil Aviation Authority escalated on Wednesday night as plans emerged to 
axe all domestic routes and all services from Britain to non-EU countries. The budget carrier will only operate out of 
London Stansted airport and will cull 13 routes to Morocco, Ukraine, Montenegro, and Norway.We do sort of 
assume that consumers like being able to fly on Ryanair - we're not quite sure why, we've done it and enjoyment 
perhaps is not le mot juste - from non-Stanstead airports. After all, the airline gained customers by doing so and so 
those customers must have thought the bus in the sky approach worth it. 
So too about flights to non-EU countries from the UK. People took the deal on offer, it was an increase in consumer 
utility therefore.So, why the spat, why the action?A row erupted in December between Ryanair and the CAA over 
pre-Brexit rule changes. At the centre of the dispute is Ryanair's use of so-called 'wet-leasing', where airlines hire 
aircraft and crew to operate services on their behalf. Ryanair only has one UK-registered aircraft. The CAA wanted 
less than half of Ryanair's UK services to be run by 'wet leased' aircraft.No one is claiming that wet leased aircraft 
are less safe. If that were so then the CAA shouldn't allow them at all of course. But there is still this insistence:The 
CAA's Paul Smith said at the time: 'A UK airline with a significant presence in the UK, should not rely heavily on 
using wet-leased, foreign-registered aircraft.'Umm, why? We find it difficult to believe that the CAA is so hungry for 
the 146 registration fee[2] that they're willing to cause the severing of such international links.It is true that other 
countries - the EU itself - have weird rules about who may fly and where on what sort of registered aircraft. But 
that's exactly the sort of thing we've been trying to leap free of. As Joan Robinson said about trade itself, just 
because someone throws rocks in their own harbours no reason to chuck 'em in our own.At a deeper level this is 
akin to the shareholder primacy argument. That has the merit of there being the one single objective of a company. 
The same should be true of regulatory bodies - the one, single, simple, objective of the organisation. This being the 
consumer interest. That's what they're there for, to enable the maximisation of consumer utility and nothing else. 
The CAA is, perhaps simply as a result of amour propre, reducing the choices of consumers and thus acting against 
their, our, interests. The government should tell the CAA to go boil its head. After all, the entire point of the system 
is that they all work for us, in our interests. Something the CAA quite obviously isn't at present. [ 1]:

AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) announced that Forxiga has been approved in China to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular death and hospitalisation for heart failure.
The therapy can be used in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and without type-2 diabetes.
READ: Ryanair says EU needs to speed up vaccine rollout, AstraZeneca to deliver extra 9mln vaccine 
doses to EU
Heart failure is a life-threatening chronic disease that prevents the heart from pumping sufficient levels of blood 
around the body.
At least half of patients with this condition have a reduced ejection fraction, which occurs when the left ventricle 
muscle can't contract properly, and so expels less oxygen-rich blood into the body.
The approval is based on positive results from a late-stage trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
"There is no known cure for chronic heart failure except for heart transplantation, which is why there is an urgent 
need for new treatment options that can improve symptoms and help patients live longer," said Mene Pangalos, 
executive vice president BioPharmaceuticals R&D at the FTSE 100 drugs group in a statement.
"This approval marks another important step forward in our ambition to improve outcomes for millions of people 
worldwide living with this life-threatening disease," he added.

A Ryanair passenger has pleaded guilty to criminal damage, assault and entering an aircraft while under the 
influence of alcohol following a drunken rampage on a flight from Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, to Manchester, 
England last month.
According to the Manchester Evening News, 24-year-old Daniel Hendry refused to wear a face mask and was seen 
with an open bottle of vodka that was "three-quarters consumed" before he later headbutted a male flight attendant 
on the January 29 flight.
"F**k off, I'm going to punch you, going to smash your head in," Hendry told the crew member.
"He became aggressive with one of the cabin crew, Samuel Proietti, who was unable to hear some of the 
comments he was making due to his strong accent," said prosecutor Janice Vallancee via the Evening News.
"He then headbutted Mr. Proiretti, not making full contact though as he moved his head out of the way but Hendry 
connected with the right side of his face, but caused no visible injury."
Hendry is also accused of stroking the arm of a female crew member and trying to hug her.
The pilot attempted to divert the chaotic flight but was unable to due to pandemic-related airport closures. Instead, 
the flight landed 25 minutes early at Manchester Airport, where Hendry was taken into custody.
Hendry is scheduled to be sentenced for the outburst next month. Nearly one year into the COVID-19 
pandemic, airlines have banned thousands of travelers for refusing to cooperate with face-covering requirements.

Brussels needs to mandate the right green fuels for aviation INSIDE BUSINESS EUROPE

Could history be about to repeat itself? In a few weeks, Brussels will publish proposals to help the aviation industry 
reach its goal of net zero emissions by 2050.
The proposals would impose an EUwide requirement for a minimum amount of green aviation fuel to be injected 
into the tanks of every aircraft refuelling in the bloc, along with expected incentives to develop fuel production 
facilities.
The last time the EU decided to lead the charge on reducing emissions in aviation - one of the most difficult sectors 
to decarbonise because of the energy efficiency of kerosene fuel for aircraft - it sparked a battle with the US.
The attempt in 2012 to make airlines flying in and out of Europe join the EU's emissions trading scheme was not 
only challenged by US airlines in court; the Congress outlawed participation. In the end, Brussels restricted the 
rules to flights in the bloc.
Fast-forward nine years and US airlines are again opposed to EU proposals, this time for a quota on green fuels, 
which may be up to 80 per cent less carbon-emitting than traditional jet fuel over their lifecycle but which remain two 
to four times more expensive.
Some European airlines, such as Ryanair, are also against an EU-only mandate for advanced biofuels, largely 
produced from household, municipal or industrial waste.
Brussels needs to mandate the right green fuels for aviation INSIDE BUSINESS EUROPE
Hit by the collapse in air travel during the pandemic, no carrier wants to pay more for fuel, which has at times 
accounted for up to 30 per cent of airline operating costs, depending on oil prices. Nor do European airlines want to 
be undercut by rivals able to exploit cheaper fuel costs outside the bloc.
The controversy over the EU's proposals is not limited to quotas. Even supporters of the mandate are voicing 
unease over how the EU might define what is sustainable.
Last month groups including Air France, Finnair, easyJet and IAG called for exclusion of crop-based biofuels from 
any mandate to avoid unintended environmental consequences.
Horse-trading in March. EU states will push down or toughen rules to suit Environmental groups are worried by 
differing definitions of what can be classified as a sustainable feedstock. Some that are acceptable might prove 
unsustainable. This might be because there is not enough to meet competing demand from different sectors, as 
with used cooking oil. Or it could be because unintended consequences are eventually recognised. For example, 
the residue generated from processing palm oil for the food industry - known as palm fatty acid distillate - is used by 
Finland's Neste and France's Total to create biofuels. While PFAD may be a residue rather than a primary product 
of cultivation, its use has been criticised for enhancing the commercial viability of palm oil, a crop that has 
contributed to deforestation.
But it is when the proposals are pub-lished in March that the horse-trading will begin. Member states will push to 
water down or toughen up the rules to suit their industries. Sweden, for example, has indicated that it wants a broad 
definition for sustainable fuels, including crop-based feedstock. Germany, on the other hand, is opposed to biofuels 
and wants to promote the use of nextgeneration electrofuels, created by combining hydrogen extracted from water 
with carbon taken from the air.
Previous attempts in the EU to encourage the voluntary take-up of sustainable fuels through tax incentives and 
carbon trading rewards have failed. Renewable fuels today account for 0.05 per cent of total jet fuel consumption in 
the EU.
But the commission would waste an opportunity if it failed to use the forthcoming ReFuelEu strategy to go further 
and accelerate development of nextgeneration electrofuels, which in time could overtake biofuels. The production 
process is still prohibitively expensive. But if enough renewable energy can eventually be supplied at reasonable 
cost, it offers even greater environmental benefits than biofuels without the risks to land use or supply.
It is debatable whether aviation as we know it can ever truly be emissionsfree. Electric and hydrogen technologies 
will be better suited to regional or shorter-haul travel. But roughly half of aviation emissions are generated by wide-
body passenger and freight longhaul flights that may be harder to replace by other modes of transport. For the 
biggest aircraft, there is no obvious solution other than liquid fuel. The faster the electrofuels industry can be 
developed, the more sustainable those flights will be.

Could history be about to repeat itself? In a few weeks, Brussels will publish proposals to help the aviation industry 
reach its goal of net zero emissions by 2050.
The proposals would impose an EUwide requirement for a minimum amount of green aviation fuel to be injected 
into the tanks of every aircraft refuelling in the bloc, along with expected incentives to develop fuel production 
facilities.
The last time the EU decided to lead the charge on reducing emissions in aviation - one of the most difficult sectors 
to decarbonise because of the energy efficiency of kerosene fuel for aircraft - it sparked a battle with the US.
The attempt in 2012 to make airlines flying in and out of Europe join the EU's emissions trading scheme was not 
only challenged by US airlines in court; the Congress outlawed participation. In the end, Brussels restricted the 
rules to flights in the bloc.
Fast-forward nine years and US airlines are again opposed to EU proposals, this time for a quota on green fuels, 
which may be up to 80 per cent less carbon-emitting than traditional jet fuel over their lifecycle but which remain two 
to four times more expensive.

Norwegian wouldn’t
The Nordic carrier may have exited the long-haul, low-cost market that it helped to pioneer, but its influence 
remains
Graham Dunn London
Norwegian is abandoning the long-haul, low-cost model it pioneered over the past decade. But even though it will 
no longer be active in the sector, its legacy may be a long-term impact on the transatlantic market.
That Norwegian is dropping its long-haul activity to focus on its short-haul business in a bid to secure its future 
comes as no surprise.
During the carrier’s restructuring in the summer of 2020 chief executive Jacob Schram was still talking up the 
potential of long-haul routes as part of its activities. But as the scale of Norwegian’s financial challenges and bleak 
near-term outlook for long-haul travel became apparent, a switch to short-haul as part of a bid for survival seemed 
likely.
Norwegian had been the poster child for the long-haul, low-cost sector. Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary 
teased with the idea of a similar project if the right aircraft became available cheaply enough, but the carrier was 
never tempted away from its short-haul core.
Instead it was the far smaller and less heralded Norwegian, under the leadership of chief executive Bjorn Kjos, that 
in 2009 announced it was making the move to try and translate a low-cost model to long-haul.
The airline’s strategy was based on using the efficiency and range of new aircraft types to open up point-to-point 
travel outside of major hubs. It embarked on a flurry of eye-catching orders for Boeing 787 and 737 Max aircraft, 
plus Airbus A320neos, to support the plans.
No Headline In Original
This reliance on new technology, though, came with risks. Norwegian was forced to launch long-haul flights – which 
debuted on the Olso-New York JFK route in May 2013 – with a leased A340-300 because of delays to the 
Dreamliner programme. Later disruption was caused by the type’s Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines, followed by the 
grounding of the Max in 2019.
US approval
Securing US approval to operate transatlantic flights was also a long process due to labour issues.
Despite these challenges, Norwegian did ultimately build a sizeable long-haul – predominantly transatlantic – 
operation: in 2018 it flew more than 70 routes linking Europe to North American destinations.
Norwegian’s encroachment into a market dominated by network carriers inevitably brought a reaction.
Most notable was IAG’s. The British Airways and Iberia parent found Norwegian treading on its turf in Barcelona 
and London Gatwick. Its response was to launch its own low-cost brand Level from the Spanish city and to utilise 
higher-density BA 777s for rival routes from London.
IAG’s interest was sufficiently piqued to initiate takeover moves in the spring of 2018, although its approaches were 
ultimately rebuffed.
But despite a clear impact on the market, financial success proved more elusive.
A number of the new long-haul routes it launched with narrowbodies proved short-lived: links from Providence in 
Rhode Island to Belfast and Edinburgh in the UK, Cork and Shannon, Ireland and from Stewart airport – serving 
New York – to Belfast, Bergen in Norway, Edinburgh and Shannon were all cut in 2018. That year it shifted its 
Gatwick flights from Fort Lauderdale and Oakland to the more mainstream Miami and San Francisco, respectively, 
in pursuit of higher yields.
By 2019, Norwegian was redoubling its restructuring efforts as its financial position grew more precarious. Come 
September that year it cut its remaining transatlantic flights from Ireland.
By the time Schram arrived at the start of 2020, Norwegian was in full-blown retrenchment mode – a process that 
became critical when the pandemic hit and ultimately forced the carrier into formal restructuring and an end to its 
long-haul business.
Norwegian’s struggles in the sector were not isolated, however: both Primera and Wow Air departed after hitting 
financial difficulties.
Before the financial crisis of 2008, the emerging model in the transatlantic market was all-premium carriers, with a 
flurry of new entrants like Eos, Maxjet and Silverjet. However, their presence was short-lived and they did not return 
as the economy recovered.
John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting, says that while it is not possible to say this is the end of the long-haul, 
low-cost model, it confirms the “magnitude of challenge” to make it work, “with or without a pandemic to contend 
with”.
“It has always been a challenge to reconcile a model which, on the one hand, requires low price as the key demand 
driver, whilst on the other needing aircraft which are ultra-fuel efficient but expensive from a lease/ownership 
perspective,” he says.
Clearly evaluating the future of a business model at the height of a global pandemic, when all long-haul travel – 
regardless of model – is all but wiped out, is nigh on impossible. Even once long-haul markets open up again, the 
sector will take time to return to previous dynamics.
No Headline In Original
“Given fragile demand overall, network carriers will compete ever more vigorously for price-sensitive traffic and with 
the loss of premium-fare traffic on which they have relied will need to make their own businesses even more cost 
efficient and adaptable,” Strickland says.
Access to feed traffic will also play into the hands of the network carriers, he says. However, he sees some 
potential for hope with the arrival of long-range narrowbodies which offer “opportunities to take a lower-risk 
approach to long-haul, low-cost, from a capacity viewpoint”.
Premium traffic
But he adds: “I remain sceptical of the opportunity for large-scale success and tend to share the view of Michael 
O’Leary that long-haul remains a game where high--margin premium traffic plays a -pivotal role in whatever shape 
or form that turns out to be in the coming years.”
The extent to which Norwegian and others were able to translate the principles of the low-cost model to long-haul – 
given the constraints around fundamentals such as turnaround times and utilisation rates – is open for debate.
It did, at the very least, do what budget carriers have been doing on short-haul for years – bringing a range of direct 
flights to airports that had never had them before and stimulating the demand through lower fares. But the routes 
that proved most sustainable, and which had survived the network cull prior to the pandemic, were those that 
operated in more established markets, such as Gatwick-JFK.
But arguably Norwegian’s biggest contribution, just like the all-premium carriers a decade ago, and the likes of 
Virgin Atlantic and Laker Airways before that, was to be a new entrant from outside the established world of network 
carriers.
WestJet from the Canadian side has also done this, since launching long-haul flights to Gatwick in 2016, and 
JetBlue Airways is set to continue that model.
The carrier announced in early 2019 that it planned to launch transatlantic flights in 2021, with services to London 
from New York JFK and Boston. While there is likely a timing impact from the coronavirus crisis, it remains keen to 
join the fray.
“We actually think that launching flights to London next summer, probably in Q3, is the perfect time to introduce all 
of my friends in the UK and in Europe to what I consider the very positive effect of flying JetBlue,” said the airline’s 
chief executive Robin Hayes last October.
JetBlue is still to identify which London airport it will serve, but in utilising JFK and Boston it will operate from at 
least one established hub. The services, though, will again capitalise on the range and efficiencies of new 
narrowbodies, in the shape of the A321LR and A321XLR. ◗

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) was ordered by the UK watchdog to remove its Jab &amp; Go ad that 
complainants found "offensive" and "irresponsible".
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 2,370 complaints, the third-largest number ever.
READ: Ryanair sees traffic plummet 88% in January
People felt the airline was implying that most of the UK population would be vaccinated against Covid-19 by 
spring/summer 2021 so holidays wouldn't be affected by pandemic-related restrictions.
The airline had two TV ads running in December and January, the first with on-screen text stating "VACCINES ARE 
COMING" while a voice said "Covid vaccines are coming. So book your Easter and summer holidays today with 
Ryanair. One million seats on sale from £19.99 to sunshine destinations in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece and many 
more. So you could jab and go!".
The second used the same exact text and imagery but a different price.
According to the ASA statement, Ryanair said the Government had continued to give optimistic briefings into early 
January 2021 while the airline "considered that any reasonable member of the public would therefore understand 
that two doses of vaccine were needed to provide effective protection against Covid-19, and that immunity was not 
granted instantaneously but instead built over time".
Shares added 4% to (EURO)15.64 on Wednesday in the late morning.

Ryanair today reported a third quarter loss of €306m in 2020, compared to a profit of €88m in the third quarter of 
the year before. In this 3-month period to 31 December, third quarter traffic fell from 36m to 8m (-78%). 
Ryanair has warned that Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc across the industry. Christmas and New Year traffic 
was severely impacted by UK travel bans imposed at short notice by many EU Governments on 19 and 20 
December. These flight bans and travel restrictions saw the Group’s December traffic fall by 83% to just 1.9m 
passengers.  
As announced on 7 January, Ryanair expects the latest lockdowns and pre-arrival Covid test requirement to 
materially reduce flight schedules and traffic through to Easter. The Group’s full-year (FY21) traffic forecast was 
therefore reduced to “between 26m to 30m” passengers.   Ryanair expect intra-European capacity to be 
significantly reduced for the next few years, which will create growth opportunities for Ryanair to take advantage of 
recovery growth incentives, as it takes delivery of 210 new (lower cost) Boeing 737s. Furthermore, Ryanair says as 
soon as the Covid-19 virus recedes, Ryanair and its partner airports will rapidly restore schedules, recover lost 
traffic, help the nations of Europe to reboot their tourism industry, and create jobs for young people across the cities 
and beaches of the EU.  
Ryanair said in the statement that it take some comfort from the success of the UK vaccine programme which is on 
target to vaccinate almost 50% of the UK population (30m) by the end of March. The airline has called for the EU to 
step up the "slow pace" of its rollout programme to match the UK’s performance.   According to Goodbody 
Stockbrokers, "While the headline numbers on losses look worse than forecast, the market will be comforted that 
this has not compromised the strength of the balance sheet, nor the ability of the company to position itself to take 
Ryanair warns Covid-19 continues to "wreak havoc across the industry"
market share in the expected recovery this summer, with this the key message management are giving in its 
continued commitment to invest in crew training at this time of the year."

easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ), Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) and Wizz Air Holdings PLC (LON:WIZZ) are expected 
to see a slower recovery than expected, according to JP Morgan.
Analysts believe that the ramp up in intra-European air travel will take longer because of the slow rollout of 
vaccinations across the continent and the cautious commentary of the low-cost carriers in their recent quarterly 
results.
READ: Ryanair ordered to remove 'offensive' Jab & Go ad by UK watchdog
However, the bank said many investors "remain sanguine" on the sector given that many European countries could 
vaccinate around half of their citizens by mid-2021 and there appears to be significant pent-up demand for leisure 
travel.
Nonetheless, another two quarters of cash burn is not helpful for balance sheets and equity valuations.
In fact, analysts cut the target prices by 14% to 710p for easyJet, by 7% to (EURO)16.25 for Ryanair and by 2% to 
5,600p for Wizz Air.
Wizz Air remains the top pick in the sector as JP Morgan still expects a 21% potential return, while Ryanair is facing 
a challenging six months after full-year passenger numbers are expected to come in at the bottom of the 80-120mln 
forecast.
Slow vaccine rollout to hit low-cost airlines recovery, says JP Morgan
While both of these have a healthy liquidity position, easyJet's is "ok", the analysts said, and only as long as 
European leisure travel meaningfully picks up in the quarter to September 2021.
Shares in easyJet rose 2% to 790p, Ryanair advanced 3% to (EURO)15.60 and Wizz Air added 4% to 4,812p on 
Wednesday at noon.

An advertisement published by Irish airline Ryanair which said people could have a "jab" and then "go" on holiday 
has been pulled by Britain's advertising watchdog.
The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) said it received 2,370 complaints about Ryanair's advert, aired between 
December 26 and January 3, making it the third most complained about advertisement of all time.
The ad was broadcast on television and depicted a syringe with a text saying "vaccines are coming."
A voiceover followed, stating: "Covid vaccines are coming. So book your Easter and summer holidays today with 
Ryanair. One million seats on sale from 19.99 pounds (27 dollars) to sunshine destinations in Spain, Italy, Portugal, 
Greece and many more. So you could jab and go!" 
Viewers who complained said that the advertisement implied most of the population would be successfully 
vaccinated against Covid-19 by the spring or summer of 2021 and would be able to travel.
They added the adverts were misleading, irresponsible and found the phrase "jab and go" offensive.
After an investigation, the ASA upheld the claims the advert was misleading and irresponsible but said it was not 
offensive under its rules.
Ryanair told dpa it "respectfully disagrees" with the ASA's decision, describing the advert as "factual and accurate" 
as vaccines were being rolled out.
"The ASA's ruling flies in the face of the UK's successful vaccine rollout, however even though this ruling is 
baseless, Ryanair will comply with it and the Jab & Go adverts will not run again," a spokesperson added.

UK Advertising Watchdog Orders Ryanair To Remove 'Jab & Go' Ads Over Misleading Claims
UK Advertising Watchdog Orders Ryanair To Remove 'Jab & Go' Ads Over 
Misleading Claims

 The UK Advertising Standards Authority on Wednesday ordered Ryanair (RYA.L) to remove its "jab and go" 
advertisements after the watchdog received complaints over misleading claims.
Over the past two months, the authority received 2,370 complaints who said the ads implied that most of the UK 
population would be able to travel unaffected by the regulations by summer 2021.
"The ads must not be broadcast again in the form complained of. We told Ryanair DAC to ensure their ads did not 
mislead viewers about the impact that Covid-19 vaccines would have on their ability to travel abroad during Easter 
and summer 2021, and to ensure their ads did not encourage irresponsible behavior," according to the ruling. 
The airline, on the other hand, said it made no specific claims about vaccine administration and did not consider the 
content of the advert to be insensitive to people with COVID-19 or who had lost people to the virus.

https://bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-jab-and-go-tv-ad-banned-for-encouraging-covid-19-risk-taking/The 
UK's 
advertising watchdog has banned Ryanair's controversial 'jab and go' holiday TV campaign, saying it encouraged 
the public to act irresponsibly once they have received a coronavirus vaccination shot.The Advertising Standards 
Authority's decision to ban the two TV ads, which have become the third most complained-about campaign of all 
time, comes days after the Ryanair chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said the vaccine programme would allow 
British families to flock to Europe for summer holidays this year. The ad campaign, which featured a small bottle 
labelled 'vaccine' and a syringe, encouraged the public to snap up bargain deals to sunny European destinations 
such as Spain and Greece because 'you could jab and go'. Launched on Boxing Day, the ad said 'Covid vaccines 
are coming so book your Easter and summer holidays today with Ryanair'. The ads showed groups in their 20s and 
30s engaged in activities such as jumping in a pool and being served at a restaurant, with no social distancing or 
use of face coverings. 
The campaign struck a nerve with the public, prompting 2,370 complaints to the ASA. Some complainants said it 
was misleading to suggest most people would be vaccinated by spring or summer and so be able to go abroad, and 
that being vaccinated meant no restrictions would be in place. Others said it was irresponsible because it 
encouraged people to believe that once they had even the first vaccination shot they would not need follow health 
restrictions. Ryanair said the assertions made in the ads were not out of step with government goals, and that they 
were designed to be 'uplifting and encourage viewers to consider a brighter future'. The airline told the ASA that the 
ads showed people 'holidaying in their social bubble' and that there were 'no requirements that holidaymakers be 
shown wearing face masks or social distancing'. The ASA ruled that the ads broke the UK ad rules relating to 
misleading and irresponsible advertising. 'We considered some viewers were likely to infer that by Easter and 
summer 2021 it would be possible for anyone to get vaccinated in order to go on a booked holiday, that maximal 
protection could be achieved immediately through one dose of the vaccine, and that restrictions around social 
distancing and mask wearing would not be necessary once individuals were vaccinated,' the ASA said in its ruling. 
'We considered this could encourage vaccinated individuals to disregard or lessen their adherence to restrictions, 
which in the short term could expose them to the risk of serious illness, and in the longer term might result in them 
spreading the virus. As such we considered the ads could encourage people to behave irresponsibly once 
vaccinated. The ads must not be broadcast again.' Ryanair said that while it would comply with the ad ban it 
Ryanair 'jab and go' TV ad banned for encouraging Covid-19 risk-taking
believed the ASA's decision was at odds with the success of the government's vaccination programme. 'The ASA's 
ruling flies in the face of the UK's successful vaccine rollout,' said a spokesman. 'However, even though this ruling 
is baseless, Ryanair will comply with it and the jab and go adverts will not run again.' A national newspaper ad by 
Paddy Power that promised losing punters their money back if South African athlete Oscar Pistorius was acquitted 
of allegedly killing his girlfriend is the most-complained about UK ad of all time, attracting 5,525 complaints and a 
ban. Travel company Booking.com is responsible for the second-most complained about ad, which substituted the 
word 'booking' for a well known swearword. The TV and cinema ad prompted 2,451 complaints that it encouraged 
foul language. The ASA dismissed the complaints saying it was a lighthearted play on words and viewers were 
likely to have picked up the swearword elsewhere. Read more: Ryanair 'jab and go' TV ad banned for encouraging

Feb 03, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
American Airlines AAL[1], Southwest Airlines LUV[2], JetBlue Airways JBLU[3] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] 
reported losses for fourth-quarter 2020. Results were hurt by dismal passenger revenues as air travel remained 
suppressed. Notably, the likes of Hawaiian Holdings and Alaska Air Group ALK[5] too met a similar fate when they 
posted their respective fourth-quarter numbers as mentioned in the previous week's write up[6].Meanwhile, United 
Airlines UAL[7] reportedly [8]warned roughly 14,000 employees that their jobs will be at risk with the expiry of the 
$15 billion worth second round of federal aid for the airlines on Mar 31, 2021. Consequently, labor unions are 
asking for more federal relief. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. American Airlines incurred a 
fourth-quarter 2020 loss (excluding 5 cents from non-recurring items) of $3.86 per share, comparing favorably with 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $3.92. However, the company delivered earnings per share of $1.15 in 
the year-ago quarter. Operating revenues of $4,027 million slumped 64.4% year over year but surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $3,859.2 million. 
American Airlines expects system capacity for the March quarter to nosedive 45% from the figure reported in first-
quarter 2019[9].2. JetBlue incurred a fourth-quarter 2020 loss (excluding 19 cents from non-recurring items) of 
$1.53 per share, comparing favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.72. However, operating 
revenues of $661 million plunged 67.4% year over year due to the 68.9% decrease in passenger revenues, which 
accounted for bulk (91.7%) of the top line. Revenues from other sources too declined 33.8% to $55 million. The top 
line, nonetheless, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $617.8 million[10].3. Southwest Airlines incurred a 
loss of $1.29 per share (excluding 25 cents from non-recurring items) in the fourth quarter of 2020, narrower than 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.69. However, operating revenues of $2,013 million lagged the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $2,117.5 million. The top line declined 64.9% year over year as well with passenger 
revenues, accounting for bulk (82.6%) of the top line, dropping 68.7%. The company predicts average core cash 
burn to worsen in the first quarter of 2021 to approximately $17 million per day from nearly $12 million in fourth-
quarter 2020[11].4. Ryanair, currently carrying a Zacks Rank# 4 (Sell), incurred a loss (excluding 8 cents from non-
recurring items) of $1.62 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 (ended Dec 31, 2020), narrower than the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.95. Results reflect coronavirus-induced disruptions in air-travel demand. 
Meanwhile, quarterly revenues of $406.9 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $495 million[12]. With air-
travel demand remaining suppressed, Ryanair's January traffic plunged 88% year over year. Load factor (% of

today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[13].5. In a customer-friendly move, Delta Air Lines DAL[14] and 
Italian carrier Alitalia are codesharing on COVID-tested flights operating between the United States and Italy. By 
producing a negative COVID-19 result prior to flying, passengers can avoid being in quarantine on their arrival at 
any of the two countries' airports. Per the deal, passengers can book to fly on Alitalia's dedicated COVID-tested 
flights from New York-JFK and Delta's COVID-tested flights from Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson International airport. 
Both fly to Rome's Fiumicino airport. Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) said traffic plummeted 88% to 1.3mln passengers last month.
The budget airline operated around 15% of its normal January schedule with a 69% load factor.
READ: Ryanair says EU needs to speed up vaccine rollout, AstraZeneca to deliver extra 9mln vaccine 
doses to EU
On Monday, the firm said the EU should speed up its vaccine rollout after guiding to an eye-watering net loss of 
(EURO)850mln-(EURO)950mln in the financial year to next March.
It made a (EURO)306mln quarterly loss as it flew around 8mln people in the three months to end-December 2020 
compared to 36mln a year earlier.
Revenues were just (EURO)0.34bn for the quarter, down 82% from the (EURO)1.91bn the year before, though 
operating costs fell to (EURO)0.67bn from (EURO)1.81bn.
"We take some comfort from the success of the UK vaccine programme which is on target to vaccinate almost 50% 
of the UK population (30mln) by the end of March," it said in a statement.
"The EU now needs to step up the slow pace of its rollout programme to match the UK's performance."
Analysts at Peel Hunt said February and March will be even weaker due to the worsening travel restrictions.

"We retain our Sell recommendation as we do not believe the stock is discounting the recovery risks, which may 
include a slower easing of travel restrictions than expected and ongoing requirements for pre-departure PCR 
testing," the broker commented.
Shares rose 2% to (EURO)14.62 early on Tuesday.

One of the many perversities of lockeddown existence is that unbelievable TV holiday ads are now believable.
Beaches may indeed be unspoilt at the height of the school holidays. Swimming pools could be strangely devoid of 
bombing teens and inflatables. But for low-cost airline Ryanair, which normally helps 152m people a year ruin such 
tranquil scenes, Covid flight curbs are also all too real. Yesterday's third-quarter numbers showed it had operated 
30 per cent of its normal flights in the three months to December, at 70 per cent occupancy.
That meant 57 spare seats per average flight - to most passengers, an unbelievable amount of elbow room. This is 
not Ryanair's idealised vision. Those schedule and load percentages combined to cut revenue in the period by 85 
per cent to (EURO)177m. The company now forecasts a full-year net loss of up to (EURO)950m - five times its 
2009 nadir.
Michael O'Leary left no doubt where the blame lay. "The EU now needs to step up the slow pace of its [vaccine] 
rollout programme to match the UK's performance," the Ryanair chief said before spending yesterday putting TV 
commercials in news interviews.
"We expect to see a very strong return of British families travelling to the beaches of Spain, Portugal, Italy and 
Greece," he told the BBC. "We'll be passing on even lower fares."
He needed to, because burning cash is more costly than not burning jet fuel. Analysts at Liberum noted: "Cash burn 
was (EURO)1bn, which is clearly not sustainable against period end gross liquidity of (EURO)3.5bn with looming 
Flying blind UK COMPANIES
[(EURO)1.5bn] debt maturities". But fly 120m mostly vaccinated people to those beaches, as Ryanair hopes to in 
the coming year, and the strength of its balance sheet is no longer in doubt.
On top of the cash and a BBB credit rating, about 80 per cent of the fleet is "unencumbered" by charges or lease 
arrangements and is valued above (EURO)7bn. Funding new aircraft and buying growth should be plain sailing.
Investors seem to agree, with shares rising 1 per cent.

Sharp remarks O'Leary prods EU to catch up with Britain on jabs as Ryanair faces (EURO)1bn loss

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, called on the EU to "get its act together" on vaccinations as the airline 
warned it was facing an annual loss of nearly (EURO)1bn because of travel restrictions.
The boss of Europe's biggest low-cost carrier said he was hopeful for a "strong recovery" in passenger numbers 
this year but that European governments needed to "catch up" with the UK, which has administered nearly 10m 
vaccine doses.
"Europe sadly is lagging behind ... that to us is not acceptable. Europe needs to get its act together," Mr O'Leary 
said yesterday in comments alongside the airline's results.
Mr O'Leary was confident, however, the airline would benefit from a sharp recovery in travel this summer. "We 
expect to see a very strong return of British families travelling to the beaches of Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece in 
relative safety this summer," he told the BBC.
The carrier is facing the worst performance in its 35-year history and forecasts a loss of between (EURO)850m and 
(EURO)950m in its current financial year, which runs to the end of March.
Losses over the Christmas quarter rose to (EURO)306m, excluding exceptional items, after passenger numbers fell 
nearly 80 per cent to 35.9m. Revenue fell by a similar margin to (EURO)1.91bn.
Sharp remarks O'Leary prods EU to catch up with Britain on jabs as Ryanair faces (EURO)1bn loss
EasyJet, a rival low-cost carrier, lost about (EURO)400m over the period, and Wizz Air (EURO)114.5m.
Like other big European airlines, Ryanair had to slash its flight schedules through the autumn as anticipated 
demand failed to materialise.
The outlook has since darkened as governments try to curb travel to contain the spread of new variants of the virus. 
EasyJet said last week it would fly just a 10th of its normal schedule in the first three months of this year.
Mr O'Leary was confident the rec-overy would accelerate from the second half of the summer as vulnerable people 
are vaccinated and that from the autumn Ryanair could be flying at 70-90 per cent of normal levels.
Ryanair forecasts it will carry 26m-30m passengers in the year to the end of March, about a fifth of the previous 
year, before recovering to 80m-120m in the following 12 months.
Mark Simpson, aviation analyst at Goodbody, said: "While the headline numbers on losses look worse than 
forecast, the market will be comforted that this has not compromised the strength of the balance sheet."
With (EURO)3.5bn in cash available at the end of December, Ryanair has one of the strongest balance sheets and 
lowest costs in the industry. Mr O'Leary is also bullish that the carrier will eventually be able to use the disruption to 
grow at the expense of weaker rivals.

Ryanair chief presses EU on jabs as (EURO)1bn loss looms
The outlook has darkened as governments try to curb travel to contain the spread of new variants of the virus. 
EasyJet said last week it would fly just a 10th of its normal schedule in the first three months of this year.
Mr O'Leary was confident the rec--overy would accelerate as vulnerable people are vaccinated and that from the 
autumn Ryanair could be flying at 70-90 per cent of normal levels.
Ryanair forecasts it will carry 26m-30m passengers in the year to the end of March, about a fifth of the previous 
year, before recovering to 80m-120m in the following 12 months.
With (EURO)3.5bn in cash at the end of December, Ryanair has one of the strongest balance sheets and lowest 
costs in the industry. Mr O'Leary is also bullish that it will eventually use the disruption to grow at the expense of 
weaker rivals. Lombard page 12

Ryanair losses climb as it ups spending in anticipation of recovery
Ryanair losses climb as it ups spending in anticipation of recovery

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) made a (EURO)306mln quarterly loss as it flew around 8mln people in the three 
months to end-December 2020 compared to 36mln a year earlier.
Revenues were just (EURO)0.34bn for the quarter, down 82% from the (EURO)1.91bn the year before, though 
operating costs fell to (EURO)0.67bn from (EURO)1.81bn.
The results came on the same day that the UK government extended the waiver of the rules on the use of take-off 
and landing slots to cover the summer 2021 season, which provided a boost to rival easyJet and British Airways 
owner IAG as they will not face having to operate a minimum number of flights to protect their leading positions at 
Heathrow and Gatwick Airports.
For the full year to end-March 2021, the Irish budget airline said it is cautiously guiding to a net loss of 
(EURO)850mln-(EURO)950mln before exceptional items, with "more risk towards the lower end of the range", 
increased from the (EURO)197mln loss in the first half of the year.
But with (EURO)3.5bn of cash still in the bank, the Dublin-headquartered flier is not sitting on its hands, having 
recently increased its order for Boeing 737-8200 aeroplanes by 75 to 210 of what it calls the "gamechanger" aircraft 
as it continues to return older planes.
The Boeing 737-MAX was approved by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency to return to flying last week, 
and the process to approve other MAX variants including the 8200 is expected in the coming weeks.
Ryanair losses climb as it ups spending in anticipation of recovery
Ryanair said its cost will ramp up in the current quarter ahead of its March 31 year-end and an anticipated, if slow, 
recovery, in the spring and summer.
As well as having taken rival easyJet's seven aircraft slots at Stansted airport and extending its contract at the 
Essex base for four more years, the company is working with various airports on "recovery/growth incentives", as 
well as expanding Paris and Naples and reopening Shannon.
Current coronavirus lockdowns and travel restrictions across the EU and UK has reduced forecast traffic for the full 
year to 26mln-30mln from the previous estimate of "up to 35mln".
Looking beyond the vaccination roll-out, Ryanair said it "expects to have a much lower cost base and a strong 
balance sheet, which will enable it to fund lower fares and add lower cost aircraft to capitalise on the many growth 
opportunities that will be available in all markets across Europe, especially where competitor airlines have 
substantially cut capacity or failed".
After an initial wobble, shares in the company were roughly flat at (EURO)14.18 by late morning on Monday.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) said the EU should speed up its vaccine rollout after guiding to an eye-watering 
net loss of (EURO)850mln-(EURO)950mln in the financial year to next March.
"We take some comfort from the success of the UK vaccine programme which is on target to vaccinate almost 50% 
of the UK population (30mln) by the end of March," the budget airline commented.  
READ: Ryanair losses climb as it ups spending in anticipation of recovery
"The EU now needs to step up the slow pace of its rollout programme to match the UK's performance."
AstraZeneca agrees for more doses to EU after row
Following a row of over a week, AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) has agreed to deliver an extra 9mln COVID-19 
vaccine doses to the EU to make up for a massive shortfall in promised supplies.
This means the bloc will receive a total of 40mln doses in the first quarter, which is well below the 100mln initially 
agreed.
 Step forward on vaccines.@AstraZeneca will deliver 9 million additional doses in the first quarter (40 million in 
total) compared to last week's offer & will start deliveries one week earlier than scheduled. The company will also 
expand its manufacturing capacity in Europe. - Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) January 31, 2021
Coronavirus: Ryanair says EU needs to speed up vaccine rollout, AstraZeneca to deliver extra 9mln vaccine 
doses to EU
The pharma giant said last month it would be able to deliver only a quarter of the agreed volumes because of 
teething problems at its manufacturing plants.
The news caused friction between the two parties, with the EU demanding supplies that were destined to the UK 
and investigating a Belgian factory to understand whether jabs had been diverted to non-member states.
The Commission was criticised for threatening to put checks on the Northern Ireland border - one of the most 
difficult points in the Brexit agreement - to prevent EU-made vaccines from entering the UK.
Also on Monday, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced Pfizer/BioNTech have agreed to supply 
an extra 75mln doses in the second quarter of the year and up to 600mln in total in 2021.
Care home residents: check
February started on a positive note in the UK as the NHS has announced that all care home residents in England 
have been offered the jab.
Official figures to be released on Monday revealed the national health service has reached 10,000 care homes 
while over half a million people received the injection on Saturday, the highest number yet.
It means the country is on track for its mid-February target of covering the first four priority groups.
So far, 12% of Britain's population have received at least the first dose, including nearly nine out of ten people aged 
80 and above and over three-quarters of over-75s.

Feb 01, 2021( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Irish no-frills 
carrier Ryanair warned Monday that it will suffer a record annual loss of almost 1.0 billion euros ($1.2 billion) as the 
coronavirus pandemic ravages demand for air travel.Ryanair forecast a net loss of between 850 million and 950 
million euros in its current year to March despite the vaccines rollout."FY21 will continue to be the most challenging 
year in Ryanair's 35 year history," the company said in a statement, noting that Covid-19 was wreaking "havoc".The 
gloomy prediction came as it also reported a net loss of 306 million euros for the three months to December.The 
third quarter loss contrasted sharply with a net profit of 88 million euros a year earlier.Third-quarter revenues 
nosedived 82 percent to 340 million euros as the aviation industry was slammed by tightening travel restrictions 
imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19 and its dangerous new variants."Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc across 
the industry," Ryanair said. "Christmas and New Year traffic was severely impacted by UK travel bans imposed at 
short notice by many EU governments on December 19 and 20."Passenger numbers tanked 78 percent in the 
quarter to just 8.1 million, compared with 35.9 million last time around. 
Irish no-frills carrier Ryanair warns that it will suffer a record annual loss of almost 1.0 billion euros ($1.2 billion) 
Photo: AFP / Oli SCARFF The most recent lockdowns and restrictions were meanwhile predicted to slash annual 
traffic to between 26 million and 30 million passengers. That compared with prior guidance of up to 35 
million.Before the pandemic erupted, Ryanair had hoped to carry 155 million passengers in the current fiscal 
year."The third quarter has obviously been heavily influenced by the continuing Covid travel restrictions," said Chief 
Executive Michael O'Leary in a video accompanying the earnings release."We had expected that things would 
continue to recover in Q3 -- but in the week before Christmas the emergence of the UK and South African variants 
led to further severe travel restrictions, particularly in flights to and from the UK, and that had an adverse impact on 
the Q3 numbers."The coronavirus crisis has decimated demand for global air travel and sparked heavy losses, job 
cuts, bankruptcies and massive state rescue plans in the sector.Ryanair said it expected to benefit from growth 
opportunities in the coming years opened up by the crisis, benefitting also from new Boeing 737 aircraft ordered in 
December."We expect intra-European capacity to be significantly reduced for the next few years, which will create 
growth opportunities for Ryanair to take advantage of recovery growth incentives," it said."As soon as the Covid-19 
virus recedes... Ryanair and its partner airports will rapidly restore schedules, recover lost traffic, help the nations of 
Europe to reboot their tourism industry, and create jobs for young people across the cities and beaches of the 
EU."We take some comfort from the success of the UK vaccine programme which is on target to vaccinate almost 
50 percent of the UK population by the end of March. The EU now needs to step up the slow pace of its rollout 
programme to match the UK's performance."

       Low fares airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported that its third-quarter net loss was 320.8 
million euros or 0.2849 euros per share, compared to net income of 87.8  million euros or 0.0784 euros per share in 
the previous year.
 Total revenue for the third-quarter fell by 82% to 341.2 million euros from last year, as traffic shrank by 78% to 8.1 
million. The group recorded a 15 million euros exceptional ineffectiveness charge on fuel and currency hedges in 
the third-quarter, due to ongoing travel restrictions, reduced fourth-quarter traffic and a revised aircraft delivery 
schedule.
 Looking ahead, the company said fiscal year 2021 will continue to be the most challenging year in the company's 
35 year history. Due to recent Covid lockdowns and travel restrictions across the EU &UK;, the company reduced 
its fiscal year 2021 traffic forecast to a range of 26 million passengers - 30 million passengers from the prior outlook 
of up to 35 million passenger, with more risk towards the lower end of the range.
 While the fourth-quarter visibility remains limited due to uncertain and constantly changing Covid-19 travel 
restrictions, European Govt lockdowns, the timing of the rollout of vaccines across the EU and a very close-in 
booking curve, the company said it is cautiously guiding an fiscal year 2021 net loss, pre-exceptional items, of 
between 850 million euros and 950 million euros.

Avolon optimistic about traffic recovery

Avolon's chief risk officer, Paul Geaney, is optimistic that summer will see the start of a recovery for air traffic.
His comments are backed by airlines and travel companies, which have reported an uptick in holiday bookings after 
UK prime minister Boris Johnson announced his roadmap out of lockdown.
Easyjet, Ryanair, Tui and Thomas Cook reported a jump in bookings to destinations including Spain and Greece 
after the prime minister said international trips could potentially resume from 17 May, subject to review .
"What we need is a policy response led by IATA," Geaney has told Airfinance Journal's podcast.
He adds that returning traffic will depend not just on vaccines but also on "a health passport and some consensus 
around testing is what's needed to get us all back flying".
IATA has stated that its digital COVID travel pass should be ready within weeks.
Geaney points to stimulus packages and people making plans to travel emboldened by encouraging vaccine news 
as reasons for optimism.
"I am blown away by the statistics in the US, for example. In the two stimulus checks that have been given to 
consumers to date since the beginning of 2020, excluding the one that's under discussion at the moment, the US 
government has provided more stimulus dollars than it spent on an inflation-adjusted basis to fight the entire second 
World War. And you might ask, well, we haven't really seen any impact of that. That's why it's exciting."
According to Geaney, US consumers have reduced household debt to the lowest level in a generation and have 
paid off $100 billion of credit card debt
Geaney believes similar sentiments will be felt in other parts of the world.
"The household saving rates in Britain and across the EU have increased by multiples, so I recognize this is an 
industry that requires a global recovery to get back to rude health."
He concludes: "I'm calling it, but I think we're going to see that in the summer."
Avolon optimistic about traffic recovery
Another reason for optimism is a proposal from the US House Democrats for a transportation aid package with $14 
billion in additional payroll aid for airlines, plus $8 billion to US airports, and $1 billion for airline contractors.

       European stocks rebounded from their worst weekly decline since October on Monday after data showed Euro 
zone manufacturing growth remained resilient at the start of the year.
 IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 54.8 in January from December's 55.2 
amid renewed lockdown measures across the continent. However, that was a tad above the initial 54.7 "flash" 
estimate.
 The U.K. manufacturing sector activity improved more-than-expected in January, with the final PMI rising to 54.1 
versus 52.9 expected and 52.9 in the first readout.
 Also helping boost investor sentiment, AstraZeneca said it would deliver 9 million additional vaccine doses to the 
European Union in the first quarter of this year and added that deliveries will start one week earlier than expected.
 Meanwhile, investors shrugged off data from Destatis showing that German retail sales decreased sharply in 
December due to the restrictions imposed to control the spread of the coronavirus.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 rallied 1.2 percent to 400.64 after plunging 1.9 percent on Friday. The German DAX 
jumped 1.4 percent, France's CAC 40 index climbed 1.1 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was up 0.9 percent.
 Mining stocks rallied after silver prices surged to a five-month high in a Reddit-fueled frenzy. Fresnillo shares 
soared nearly 20 percent, Polymetal International surged 6.8 percent and Boliden AB added 4 percent. 
 ASOS rallied 3.8 percent after announcing it has acquired four brands from beleaguered Arcadia Group.
 Ryanair Holdings fell about 1 percent after it reported a €306mln quarterly loss and warned that fiscal year 2021 
will continue to be the most challenging year in the company's 35 year history.
European Shares Rise After Strong PMI Data
 JD Sports Fashion jumped almost 7 percent after the sportswear retailer entered a conditional agreement to buy 
Baltimore-based DTLR Villa LLC for $495 million.
 Siemens Healthineers shares were up 1.8 percent. The company reported that its first-quarter net income climbed 
44 percent to 437 million euros from last year's 304 million euros.
 Julius Baer, Switzerland's third-largest listed bank, lost 2 percent despite reporting a 50 percent rise in 2020 net 
profit and announcing a 450 million franc share buyback from March.

Airport slot waiver extended into summer by the UK
Airport slot waiver extended into summer by the UK

Highlight: Britain has announced that it will extend a waiver on airport slot rules through the summer season to 
help airlines during the pandemic.
Body
This will eliminate the need for carriers to fly in order to retain their takeoff and landing windows. Last year, rules in 
connection with the takeoff and landing rights were suspended, which liberated airlines from the compulsory usage 
of 80% of their takeoff and landing spots, reported Reuters. Failing to do so would have resulted in the loss of slots 
for their carriers. 
In a statement, the Department for Transport said that the move 'provided flexibility to airlines to support them 
during this difficult time' and exhibited the prevailing low demand for air travel. Many airlines are struggling fiscally 
due to Covid-19 restrictions in Britain. While high-cost airlines such as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have 
welcomed the extension, low-cost carriers wish to go back to normal rules. Ryanair and Wizz Air stated that the 
suspension will not allow them to add new flights and, hence, they will fail in creating competition. Earlier, Airport 
Coordination Limited (ACL), an independent slot co-ordination company, said that alleviation would be arranged in 
the UK for the Northern Summer 2021, subject to slots being resumed to three weeks or more in advance of the 
planned operation. The company added that the new slots will not be included in the alleviation. In December, an 
EU proposal was made to restore some slot competition in 2020. Moreover, this is the UK's first decision on airport 
slot rules since it left the European Union's circle on 31 December 2020. This move will also get rid of the necessity 
for 'ghost flights' as, before the introduction of the waiver, some airlines flew empty to protect their landing spots. In 
a separate development, Urban-Air Port, a British-based start-up, has partnered with Hyundai Motor to develop the 
infrastructure needed for futuristic flying cars. Urban-Air Port, which was selected by a government programme, has 
secured a $1.65m grant to aid the temporary installation of the airport in Coventry city centre.

 Ryanair (RYA.L) on Monday reported an attributable loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 following a plunge in 
revenue as air traffic tumbled 78% due to the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.
The airline swung to a loss attributable to equity holders for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2020, of 320.8 million 
euros ($389.1 million), or a loss of 0.285 euro per share, compared with an attributable profit of 87.8 million euros, 
or 0.078 euro per share, in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2020.
Revenue declined to 341.2 million euros from 1.91 billion euros.
Looking ahead, Ryanair "cautiously" expects fiscal 2021 net loss to be in the range on 850 million euros to 950 
million euros as COVID-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions are expected to reduce traffic forecasts to be in the 
range of 26 million to 30 million from the previously estimated up to 35 million.
The company's shares fell about 2% at the end of trading on Jan. 29.

Feb 01, 2021( Financial Buzz: http://www.financialbuzz.com Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair (NASDAQ: RYAAY), 
an Irish low-cost airline, anticipates a USD1.2 Billion Loss for its 2021 fiscal year, ending March 31. CEO, Michael 
O'Leary, says it will have a 'dramatic recovery' at some point in the year amid the Covid-19 vaccinations. Shares 
have plummeted 12% since the beginning of 2021. 'Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc across the industry,' 
Ryanair said in a statement. 
It revealed that both Christmas and New Year traffic 'was severely impacted' thanks to travel restrictions on U.K. 
travelers that caused an 83% fall in movement during December. European governments have continued to enforce 
lockdowns as Covid cases rise. Though it is unknown when countries will return to normality, they have begun to 
vaccinate their citizens in hopes of hastening the process.  'We take some comfort from the success of the U.K. 
vaccine program, which is on target to vaccinate almost 50% of the U.K. population (30 million) by the end of 
March. The EU now needs to step up the slow pace of its rollout program to match the U.K.'s performance,' Ryanair 
said on Monday. During an investor call, O'Leary stated that bookings were going to 'snap back very strongly' after 
people's confidence in vaccines grew within the European Union. 'I would be reasonably confident that we will see a 
return to relatively high-volume travel in that key July, August, September quarter,' he said. Contingent on the 
results of the European Union's vaccines rollout, traffic is believed to increase to 20-25% of pre-pandemic levels 
during April and June, while rising to 50-70% between July and September. 'We are somewhat in the lap of the 
gods,' he said.

Ryanair is "cautiously" guiding for net loss for the 2020/21 financial year of (EURO)850 million ($1 billion) to 
(EURO)950 million before exceptional items.
This follows a third quarter, to 31 December, in which Ryanair posted a net loss of (EURO)321 million, which 
compares with a (EURO)17 million profit in the prior-year period.
At the end of its third quarter, the low-cost carrier had (EURO)2.41 billion of cash and cash equivalents, from 
(EURO)2.56 billion at the start of the period.
At 31 December it had a fleet of 428 narrowbody aircraft, down from 445 a year earlier. During the quarter, its 
aircraft rentals fell 82% to (EURO)6.2 million due to seven fewer leased 737 aircraft.
Ryanair expects to repay (EURO)1.5 billion of maturing debt in the first six months of 2021, including its (EURO)600 
million Covid Corporate Financing Facility from the UK government and, in June, an (EURO)850 million bond.
Ryanair hopes that the Boeing 737 Max 200, which it terms the 737-8200, will receive EASA certification "in the 
coming weeks", allowing it to receive 24 of the new type before the peak summer season. First delivery in expected

UK airlines welcome waiver extension for landing slots Travel & leisure

UK carriers including British Airways, easyJet and Virgin Atlantic will hang on to lucrative take-off and landing slots 
without having to use them this summer after ministers extended waivers to airport rules.
Airlines have parked their fleets during the crippling disruption, prompting the suspension of rules forcing airlines to 
"use or lose" their slots 80 per cent of the time.
The suspension since the pandemic started has been criticised by rival airlines Ryanair and Wizz Air, which argue 
the waivers are anti-competitive and hope to profit from the disruption in the industry.
The decision is also a blow to London's Gatwick airport, which has seen many of its biggest airlines switch their 
remaining operations to Heathrow, and was pushing for airlines to be forced to use their slots. The Department for 
Transport will extend the waiver, which was due to be lifted in the spring, through the summer season, Airport 
Coordination Limited said yesterday.
The decision illustrates that ministers are expecting another difficult summer for the European airline industry as 
travel curbs widen.
It will be a relief for airlines including BA, easyJet and Virgin, which have been able to trim back their schedules 
while hanging on to spots at capacityconstrained airports.
UK airlines welcome waiver extension for landing slots Travel & leisure
Take-off and landing rights are among airlines' most valuable assets and can be traded for tens of millions of 
pounds.
"The risk for the UK is that a blanket waiver ... may discourage airlines who are prepared to restart operations from 
investing in the UK market," said Chris Butler, an analyst at ACL, which co-ordinates slot distribution.

The low-cost airline is a top-10 holding in Citywire A-rated Powe’s £2.1bn Man GLG Continental European Growth

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) reacted again Thursday to the approved multi-billion euro bailout on German carrier 
Lufthansa (LHA.F), having issued a statement earlier in the week pledging the European Commission to "stand by 
its principles and keep the skies open, fair and competitive".
The German government agreed to a 6 billion euro ($7.26 billion) recapitalization, plus a 3 billion euro state 
guaranteed loan, which was granted approval by the commission. 
"This is a spectacular case of a rich EU Member State ignoring the EU Treaties to the benefit of its national industry 
and the detriment of poorer countries. Under the pretext of Covid-19, the German Government is giving Lufthansa a 
bank-breaking bailout of 9 billion euros, which even the airline's own chief executive admits it does not need," 
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement released Monday. 
On Thursday, O'Leary said the regulator's approval "discriminates unlawfully between EU airlines," Bloomberg 
News reported, with the carrier having filed its challenge at the EU's General Court on Jan. 22.
Ryanair shares were up 3% Thursday afternoon, while Lufthansa was 2% higher.

easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) has said it expects capacity to drop by 90% in the second quarter as it burns of cash 
£40mln per week.
The budget airline said the European slot waiver mechanism in place for this winter allows it to match capacity 
against the lower demand, while the EU and UK authorities are discussing a revised slot waiver for the Summer 
2021 season.
READ: easyJet flags 250% summer bookings surge in Holidays arm
The FTSE 250 group said it is focused on cash generative flying to minimise losses and cash burn as well as 
retaining the flexibility to ramp up capacity quickly when demand picks up.
Moreover, it forecasts legacy carriers will free up capacity around Europe as they are "dramatically scaling back" 
their short-haul operations, so competition will be lower in a post-coronavirus pandemic world.
Holidays for Winter 2021/22 were launched in December and are experiencing "very positive demand" while 
bookings for Summer 2021 are currently significantly ahead of last year but many customers are waiting for further 
clarity on quarantine rules.
In the quarter to December 31, 2020, easyJet said its passenger numbers plummeted by 87% to 2.9mln as capacity 
dived 82% to 4.4mln seats. As a result, group revenue was 88% lower at £165mln.
easyJet expects capacity to drop by 90% in second quarter; cash burn £40mln per week
As of January 25, 2021, easyJet had access to £2.5bn of liquidity. Group headline costs excluding fuel were 
reduced by 52% after the firm let go a third of its staff and made seasonal contracts for its UK-based pilots, as well 
as furloughing employees in several countries.
The airline also secured new ground handling contracts at London Gatwick and at all its Swiss and Spanish airports 
and took steps to make fuel usage more efficient.
The money issue
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, noted that the airline "is still enduring real pain" with the inability to pad 
rocketing costs with passenger revenue, so it has to continuously borrow money.
"And talk of pent-up demand could be moot if most of us are prevented from jetting off on holiday this summer as 
governments prioritise getting the pandemic under control. Another problem for EasyJet is that some of its rivals, 
namely Wizz Air and Ryanair, operate with lower costs and therefore have greater flexibility to put capacity back 
online when demand does eventually return," he commented.
"For now, the market seems confident air travel will eventually recover to its pre-Covid levels. easyJet could be 
treated quite differently by creditors and shareholders if that assessment changes and a more permanent impact on 
the sector is expected."
Shares shed 2% to 702.63p early on Thursday.

While "summer is at risk" for the airline and travel companies, brokers and investment banks have rushed to 
support what they see as the best positioned stocks in the sector.
The City of London number crunchers were reacting to expectations that the government will announce mandatory 
hotel quarantine for some travellers on Wednesday, a day after Rolls-Royce warned that the new strains of 
coronavirus were likely to hit its airline revenues this year
While the accelerating deployment of vaccines means an end to the COVID-19 pandemic is potentially within sight, 
broker Liberum sees "a material and growing risk that restrictions on international travel remain onerous for longer 
than we had previously anticipated".
READ: Rolls-Royce blames new Covid strains on worsening outlook for 2021
"We now see a chance that significant restrictions remain in place and impact at least part of the peak summer 
season, jeopardising plans to begin rebuilding air travel demand and balance sheets."
Over at Peel Hunt analysts said following the latest lockdown in the UK, travel restrictions have been tightened in 
other countries "and, if anything, they are becoming more severe".
The broker sees a particular affect on business travellers and for International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC 
(LON:IAG).
IAG and Wizz Air should bounce back as summer hols at risk, say analysts
"The longer these restrictions remain in place, the more established the shift away from business travel and 
towards video calling becomes, and also the higher the group's cash burn despite its cost restructuring and leading 
market positions," the Peel Hunt analysts said.
False dawns
Global airlines face an uncertain recovery, agreed Berenberg, as lockdowns and border restrictions are 
overwhelming the COVID-19 vaccination rollout enthusiasm.
"Airlines have struggled with false dawns, with a hoped-for booking surge the latest disappointment, particularly in 
Europe," analysts at the German bank said.
Depressed levels of cash bookings are delaying the airlines' ability to return to cash flow breakeven, and with more 
equity dilution, "valuations appear elevated as many investors have also positioned for eventual travel resurgence", 
they added.
But Berenberg said it is sticking with its 'buy'-rated airlines that it sees as having "opportunities to take industry 
profit share and return towards pre-pandemic margins most quickly": IAG, Wizz Air Holdings PLC (LON:WIZZ) and 
Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV).
Berenberg upped its target prices across the sector, lifting IAG to 190p from 180p and for Wizz to 4,800p to 4,200p; 
and also upped easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) to 850p from 820p and Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) to (EURO)15 
from (EURO)12 and remained at 'hold' on both pan-European budget airlines.
Liberum, on the other hand, cut its targets for easyJet and Ryanair to 1,000p from 1,200p and to (EURO)15 from 
(EURO)17 respectively, while upping its target for IAG to 150p from 100p.
Peel Hunt downgraded its forecasts on IAG but raised their target price to 145p from 100p.
This will clearly impact the ability of passengers to fly and means that we push recovery in our forecasts back by 
three months to 2Q FY21E. We downgrade forecasts and reiterate our Hold recommendation but raise our TP to 
145p.
Rolling back the forecasts
A day earlier, Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LON:RR.) had warned that because of the new Covid variants it was 
expecting lower revenues from its airline customers in 2021.
Reacting to this, JPMorgan, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs all cut their targets, to 45p from 50p, to 53p from 
59p, and to 107p from 122p.
JPMorgan expects a recovery of the travel sector to follow a four-phase journey: flight search; flight booking; hotel 
search; and hotel booking.
"We currently stand in Phase 2, we believe, awaiting Phase 3, with the recent surge observed in flight bookings not 
yet reflected in hotel search/booking."

Jan 27, 2021( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Boeing 737 Max 
has flown over 2,700 passenger flights across 5,500 hours since November 2020. Five airlines currently fly 
passengers on the Max in the US, Canada, Brazil, Panama, and Mexico. The European Union Aviation Safety 
Agency approved the Max to fly passengers on Wednesday. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more 
stories[1].Boeing has put a considerable amount of distance between the 20-month grounding of its 737 Max and 
now to the tune of more than 2,700 flights and around 5,500 flight hours, the manufacturer announced on 
Wednesday."We made significant progress on the 737 program this quarter," Dave Calhoun, Boeing's chief 
executive officer, said. "This is the culmination of a comprehensive effort including roughly 400,000 engineering 
hours, 1,400 test and check, and over 3,000 flight hours completed on the airplane."The Federal Aviation 
Administration cleared the Max to fly again on November 18[2], with regulators in Latin America, Canada, and most 
recently, the European Union following suit. 
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency gave Boeing's troubled aircraft the green light on Wednesday, 
allowing airlines like Ryanair, Norwegian Air Shuttle, and Icelandair, among others, to finally resume Max 
flights.Middle Eastern, African, and Asian-Pacific countries remain the most notable outliers in resuming Max flights, 
with China, in particular, continuing to wait on the recertification. Calhoun said that any outstanding approvals from 
foreign regulators should come in the first half of 2021.And despite the aircraft's infamous reputation, airlines are 
reporting that flight loads remain in line with other aircraft, indicating that flyers aren't actively avoiding the Max. 
Anticipated passenger skepticism over flying on the Max prompted airlines to offer flexible change policies that 
allow flyers to change off the aircraft[3].Read more: The 16 most outrageous things Boeing employees said about 
the company, 737 Max program, and each other in released internal emails[4]The first priority for Boeing is to get 
the already-delivered Max aircraft flying again. Only five airlines have resumed flying their Max planes again and 
new regulatory approvals will mean more will be doing so in the upcoming weeks and months. "Every airline has 
different operational considerations for returning planes to revenue service and timelines for training their pilots," 
Calhoun said. "We're supporting each of them as they go through their process."Gol Linhas Areas was the first 
airline to resume Max flights in early December[5], soon followed by Aeromexico on December 21 and American 
Airlines on December 29.American, despite its late start, is proving to be the primary driver of Max flights as it 
The Boeing 737 Max has flown over 2,700 flights since its November ungrounding as the EU gives the green 
light
continues to grow its route network with the aircraft[6]. In March, American's 737 Max aircraft will be flying as far 
west as San Diego, California, as far north as Boston, and as far south as Manaus, Brazil, according to Cirium 
data.United Airlines will resume Max flights on February 11 from Denver and Houston[7] while Southwest Airlines 
will launch its first Max flights sometime in March[8], the latest of any US airline that flew the Max before its March 
2019 grounding.Simultaneously, Boeing will continue to deliver new Max aircraft to airlines as new-builds been 
sitting idle at airports across the country and in Seattle-area parking lots. Deliveries of the 450-aircraft backlog 
resumed in December and more than 40 aircraft have been delivered since then."Prior to delivery, teams are 
performing all the necessary tests and ensuring each airplane receives customized care and rolls into a delivery 
stall ready for customer acceptance and FAA review," Calhoun said.Alaska Airlines just took delivery of its first Max 
on January 23[9], the fourth and final US airline to receive the Max for now, with plans for a March 1 debut. The 
Seattle-Los Angeles and Seattle-San Diego routes will be the first to see the aircraft on its launch day.Boeing lost 
hundreds of Max orders due to the aircraft's grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic but new orders continue to 
come in. Since the ungrounding, Ireland's Ryanair placed a 75-aircraft Max order[10], Alaska grew its firm Max 
order to 68 airplanes[11], and Canada's Flair Airlines just leased 13 Max aircraft.Billions, however, remain to be 
paid in compensation to customers due to the protracted grounding."Cumulatively, we've accrued a $9.6 billion 
liability for the estimated potential concessions and other considerations," Gregory Smith, Boeing's chief financial 
officer, said on the 737 Max. "To date, we've made $3.7 billion in payments to customers in cash and other forms of 
compensation, including $600 million we paid this quarter."But the largest hurdle to Boeing's comeback following 
two fatal crashes with the Max has been overcome as the aircraft is once again back in the skies and as a result, 
deliveries have resumed and orders are once again coming in."Following one of the most rigorous certification 
efforts in aviation history, we're confident in the safety of our airplane," Calhoun said. Read the original article on

Jan 27, 2021( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Airlines 
operating in Europe such as TUIfly or Ryanair can fly the 737 MAX again after its grounding. But are they really 
needed   and will passengers be willing to board? Andreas Spaeth is looking for answers.The European Union 
Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said Wednesday that it had cleared the Boeing 737 MAX to fly again in European 
skies, paving the way for a comeback of the controversial airplane at least in theory. 
In practice though, no airline seems overly keen to redeploy the former Boeing bestseller in a hurry. No carrier 
needs extra capacity right now. Rather, aircraft parking, deferral of deliveries or even cancellations of aircraft orders 
are the new normal as the pandemic hits passenger aviation hard.A total of 641 orders for the 737 MAX were 
canceled in 2020 alone and Boeing removed from its order books another 523 seen as unlikely to be fulfilled, 
currently leaving 3,333 planes of the model to be delivered over the next few years. The US, Canada and Brazil 
paved the way for the return of the aircraft. Since late 2020, their respective aviation safety authorities have allowed 
the Boeing 737 MAX back into the skies with passengers, for the first time since the global grounding of the aircraft 
back in March 2019.It took that long for Boeing to redesign a software blamed to have contributed to two crashes in 
2018 and 2019, in which a total of 346 passengers were killed. The authorities needed time to thoroughly test the 
modified software.No unified global approachWhile other important markets like China and India still keep the 737 
MAX on the ground for the time being, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) had been busy in recent days 
touting its plan to also recertify the aircraft."The MAX will be cleared to fly again this week in Europe," said EASA 
Executive Director Patrick Ky on Monday in a hearing of the Transport Committee of the European Parliament. A 
team of 20 EASA experts had worked for two years to recertify the aircraft."In order to fly again, there are a certain 
number of prerequisites to fulfil by the aircraft; we have asked for software updates, rewiring and a certain number 
of things which we uncovered during our certification works, and also a lot of training which will be necessary for the 
pilots," said Ky.The EASA director cited four conditions that had to be met before his authority would grant a 
recertification to Boeing's former bestseller: First, fully understand what happened in the two accidents. Second, 
solving all problems with systems that contributed to the accidents, mostly the MCAS automated trimming 
system.Also, EASA insisted on reviewing certain components deemed safety-critical by the Europeans, as the 
authority didn't review them itself in the original MAX certification, being only the secondary certification authority 
then after the leading US aviation agency, FAA.Pilot training a priorityAnd the final condition was to ensure that 
pilots were properly trained how to operate the MAX. "We are now reaching a stage where we are confident that 
these four prerequisites are met and that's why we will allow the aircraft to go back to service," assured Patrick 
Ky.The 737 MAX crisis has been causing a major shake-up in procedures established for decades, with almost all 
Europe brings back Boeing 737 MAX
other certification authorities around the world used to almost automatically rubber-stamp FAA decisions and 
certifications. These procedures couldn't be continued anymore after what happened."We need to work more on 
how we work together with the FAA and how we complement each other, as it obviously didn't work well for the 
MAX," the head of EASA stressed in a recent press briefing, while acknowledging: "For the recertification of the 
MAX we had full transparency from Boeing and the FAA.This doesn't mean we were aligned and agreed every 
time, but we worked very well together." EASA is now satisfied that the 737 MAX is a 100% safe aircraft after the 
required modifications have been done."We have tested the 737 MAX even without MCAS, and it would be safe to 
fly not using the system at all," Ky pointed out. EASA's director had good news for low-cost carrier Ryanair, still 
awaiting delivery of the first of a total of 210 737 MAX-200s. In December, Ryanair topped up an earlier order, 
wanting an additional 75 planes.Supply and demand"We are also certifying the 200 variant of the MAX these days 
and expect certification to be ready in the coming weeks, so the aircraft should be ready to fly in the summer," said 
Ky. While low-cost carriers such as Ryanair are viewed as the first airlines that will see passengers returning, other 
European MAX customers are less enthusiastic. Among them is German holiday airline TUIfly, which was supposed 
to get its very first 737 MAX of 25 on order delivered on the very night in March 2019 when it was 
grounded."Currently, it is totally unclear when our MAXs might see entry into service from Germany, as not many 
flights are operating," said spokesperson Aage Dünhaupt. German-Turkish holiday airline SunExpress has ordered 
42 737 MAX, which are now supposed to arrive between the end of 2021 and 2028/29. In various polls, many 
passengers have indicated their reluctance to board a 737 MAX.That's why all airlines reintroducing it offer free 
rebookings on non-MAX flights, but this option has hardly been used in the US and Canada since the aircraft's 
return. Aviation experts believe most people will forget about the MAX problems once it has become a reliable 
workhorse, as the earlier Boeing 737 models have always been ever since Lufthansa put the world's first 737 into 
service in February 1968.

The prospect of new restrictions on international travel sent a shudder through the travel industry yesterday, piling 
pressure on companies already reeling from a year of disruption.
Shares in European airlines tumbled as the UK prepared to introduce tighter immigration rules following concerns 
that new strains of Covid-19 could spread from international travellers.
Governments in Sweden, Belgium and Germany also tightened travel curbs over the weekend.
British Airways' owner IAG led the share price declines, falling 7.7 per cent, while easyJet had dropped 6.7 per 
cent, Ryanair 4.1 per cent and cruise operator Carnival 6.5 per cent by the close.
Travel groups devastated by national lockdowns and closed borders warned that additional measures could be the 
last straw as they would knock consumer confidence during a key period for summer holiday bookings.
"These travel restrictions will make things catastrophic," said Andrew Crawley, chief commercial officer at American 
Express Global Business Travel. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, confirmed yesterday that he was "definitely 
looking" at making UK arrivals quarantine in hotels.
Johan Lundgren, easyJet's chief executive, said customer sentiment was "reliant on newsflow", but bookings 
showed there was a pent-up demand for travel whenever there were signs of governments relaxing restrictions.
Airline shares tumble on prospect of tighter rules
Airlines and travel executives are resigned to the early months of this year being a write-off. But there are mounting 
concerns that the critical summer season is under threat.
The travel industry has been careful not to criticise public health measures but has called for a pathway out of 
restrictions in time for the peak season.
"Tens of thousands of jobs and billions in lost trade are at stake and so we need a road map out of these 
restrictions as soon as possible," said Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, an industry association.
Mark Manduca, analyst at Citigroup, said Europe's airlines could need fresh cash if summer schedules were 
disrupted. This would probably involve raising fresh capital from shareholders, he added.

Glyn Jones, chief executive of Southend Airport, which is not currently running passenger flights, said the prospect 
of further restrictions was adding to consumer uncertainty over the summer season. "When people are uncertain, 
they don't tend to make buying decisions."
Airlines and travel executives are resigned to the early months of this year being a write-off. But there are mounting 
concerns that the critical summer season is under threat, particularly if the UK introduces mandatory hotel 
quarantine for inbound passengers.
Hotels run by national chains have been asked by the government to make rooms available, particularly at airport 
sites, for arrivals to quarantine for 10 days, with travellers picking up the cost, say travel industry advisers.
"At the moment the government is just putting layer upon layer of blocks on people coming into the country," said 
Lana Bennett, chief executive of Tours International, which runs itineraries for incoming tourists to the UK. The 
company took £1.4m in revenues in 2019, but Ms Bennett said it had taken no money since March and had no 
confirmed bookings for this year.

EasyJet to target national flag carriers Travel & leisure Chief says airline will shun head-to-head contests with

EasyJet to target national flag carriers; Travel & leisure Chief says airline 
will shun head-to-head contests with its low-cost rivals

EasyJet's chief executive has set his sights on using the coronavirus crisis to win market share from Europe's 
national flag carriers, rather than going head-to-head with low-cost rivals when the industry emerges from the 
pandemic.
Johan Lundgren told the Financial Times that the biggest market overlap the group had was "with companies such 
as Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Tui and British Airways. There has been huge retrenchment of capacity from their 
end ... this gives us a great opportunity to grow." He said he was not focused on competing with budget airlines 
such as Ryanair.
The pandemic has caused huge damage across the aviation industry, but legacy national airlines are expected to 
recover more slowly because they are generally geared towards business travel and short flights to feed long-haul 
hub operations. Business trips and longhaul travel are widely expected to be laggards when the market improves.
EasyJet competes with these national airlines on two-thirds of its network, and will prioritise flying from the more 
expensive airports those carriers tend to use as it plans its network for the rest of the year, Mr Lundgren said.
He is more circumspect about the opportunities arising from the crisis than Ryanair's Michael O'Leary or Wizz Air's 
József Váradi, who have both talked about a one-off chance to win huge market share. EasyJet investors have also

yet to be won over on future opportunities. The company's share price has fallen 50 per cent over the past 12 
months, while Ryanair and Wizz Air have recovered their losses.
These two carriers have been able to conserve more cash and maintain stronger balance sheets than easyJet 
because they have lower cost bases, leaving them in a better position to accelerate out of the crisis, said Alex 
Paterson, aviation analyst at Peel Hunt.
But Mr Lundgren's strategy is sensible, he added, given easyJet "wouldn't fare so well" in head-on competition with 
Ryanair and Wizz.
EasyJet's cost per seat, an important industry metric, was (EURO)80.90 in the most recent quarter, compared with 
(EURO)45.10 for Ryanair and (EURO)59.10 for Wizz, according to Chris Tarry, an aviation consultant.
Even as lockdowns and travel curbs remain in place, Mr Lundgren is optimistic about the summer season and has 
noticed that passenger bookings tend to jump "within the hour" whenever politicians suggest restrictions might be 
eased.
US carrier Delta has said it has detected similar signs of pent-up demand, but US and many European authorities 
still look a long way from relaxing the rules.

Political tension overshadows vital Air France - KLM fundraising INSIDE BUSINESS EUROPE
Political tension overshadows vital Air France-KLM fundraising; INSIDE

France is often criticised for its heavy-handed approach to cross-border industrial collaboration. Remember the 
tensions unleashed in the Renault-Nissan alliance when Paris pushed for a merger of the carmakers, knowing that 
Japan was strongly opposed? Or the battles between France and Germany for control of Airbus, the Franco-
German aircraft maker?
Now it is the turn of Air France-KLM, the airline created in 2004 by the socalled merger of France's flag carrier with 
the Netherlands' own champion.
But this time, it is not only French interference that is creating friction ahead of a vital fundraising - and possibly 
jeopardising the future of Europe's first aviation alliance. It is also the illusion perpetuated by Dutch politicians and 
KLM's management that the carrier is still an independent entity, despite having sold itself to Air France nearly two 
decades ago.
For that is what KLM did when it agreed to create what was then the world's biggest airline by revenue. At the time, 
Air France was not only bigger but healthier than KLM.
True, there were many safeguards built into the agreement that still give KLM some independence. But both airlines 
knew then - and should know now - that their fortunes are better together than apart. While there has been progress 
on collaboration, the group needs to go further if it is to compete successfully when the market recovers, and the 
likes of Ryanair and Wizz Air are gunning for market share.
Political tension overshadows vital Air France - KLM fundraising INSIDE BUSINESS EUROPE
Right now, Air France-KLM is struggling with a balance sheet that cannot bear the weight of (EURO)10.4bn in loans 
backed by the French and Dutch governments to help it through the pandemic. While there is no immediate need 
for cash, a big capital increase is required to cope with this debt burden.
But fundraising discussions must first overcome deeply embedded Dutch suspicions about the French state, which 
not illogically wants greater integration of the airline to improve competitiveness. The Dutch government, perhaps 
also understandably, wants to ensure that not a penny of Dutch taxpayers' money goes to Air France. Unlike KLM, 
it has consistently failed to tackle the labour costs that have weighed on its profitability.
French and ministers have swords too an easy path collaboration This is not a new problem. Tensions have been 
bubbling for years. While KLM benefited hugely from the alliance, a failure to restructure Air France - and violent 
protests over various attempts - have made the Dutch wary. Complicating matters, the independence of KLM - a 
symbol of the Netherland's heft in the global economy - is as much a political issue as a corporate one.
Air France-KLM's appointment in 2018 of a non-French chief executive Ben Smith, formerly of Air Canada, should 
have improved matters. Instead, he trampled on Dutch sensitivities by attempting to assert his authority over KLM's 
chief executive Pieter Elbers. Insiders say the two are barely on speaking terms. The Dutch government's 
subsequent acquisition of 14 per cent of Air France-KLM, balancing the French state's 14.3 per cent, was regarded 
as hostile by Paris.
That said, the Covid crisis may be changing mindsets. One condition of the French bailout was that Air France 
close down lossmaking routes and parts of its domestic network, Hop. Had Air France done this without 
government sanction it might have been far more difficult, analysts suggest.
And the mass resignation of the Dutch government last week could also be positive. French and Dutch finance 
ministers have crossed swords too often to find an easy path back to collaboration. A change of guard might help - 
although the Dutch finance minister, as head of one of the country's biggest parties, is likely to retain influence. In 
an ideal world, both governments would let management find the best way to extract efficiencies. But yielding power 
in an iconic company is not a good idea ahead of an election. Nor is it likely to be a new government's first act.
So, in the absence of disposals, the way forward is in delivering a competitive Air France. When it is not seen as a 
deadweight by the Dutch, there will be more incentive for further integration.
But the Dutch must also stop imagining that the partnership with Air France is temporary. When the Dutch finance 
minister suggested late last year that the alliance did not have to last forever, he might have scored some political 
points. But for Air France-KLM and its 86,000 employees, he was only further destabilising a partnership that could 
be delivering so much more.

EU flight safety agency to approve Boeing 's 737 Max jet
EU flight safety agency to approve Boeing's 737 Max jet

Dateline: Frankfurt (dpa) - 
Body
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is expected to approve Boeing's crisis-ridden 737 Max jet, 
enabling it to return to the skies in the coming days.
The approval was expected next week, after changes made to the plane model fulfilled flight safety conditions, 
EASA executive director Patrick Ky said in an online press conference on Tuesday.
The fleet of medium-haul jets was grounded in March 2019, after two 737 Max crashes due to faulty steering 
software in which a total of 346 people died.
The 737 Max has since been approved again in the United States and Brazil.
In Canada, the grounding of the aircraft is to be lifted this Wednesday, following an announcement by the local 
aviation authority Transport Canada. The airline Air Canada has said it will begin using the jet again from February 
1.
Before the 737 Max returns to Europe, pilot training has to be completed, Ky said.
The special 737 Max 200 ordered by low-cost carrier Ryanair will be certified in the coming weeks and be ready for 
the summer, he added.
Boeing had aimed to fix the problems following the first of the two crashes.
However, further defects were uncovered, meaning that it ultimately took around 20 months for the US Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) to lift the flight ban for that country in mid-November.
Ky said there had been full transparency from the FAA and Boeing after the accidents.
EU flight safety agency to approve Boeing 's 737 Max jet
The EASA chief said the European regulator had also tested the jet without the controversial MCAS software. The 
737 Max would be "a plan that flies safely without MCAS," he said.
The first of the two crashes occurred shortly after take-off from Jakarta on October 29, 2018, and killed all 189 
people on board.
The second occurred in March the following year, shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa. That crash killed all 157 
people on board.
In both cases, a sensor provided incorrect data to the software, prompting the nose to dive. Pilots were unable to 
override the automatic settings.
The new version of the software is to be fed data from two sensors. In addition, pilots are to receive training on how 
to recognize when faulty data is being delivered, Ky said.
EASA had also demanded the installation of a third sensor known as a synthetic sensor, which is yet to be 
developed.
In the long version of the jet series, the 737 Max 10, which has not yet been certified, this is to be mandatory from 
the outset. In other models, it is to be retrofitted at a later date.

Jan 19, 2021( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  The European 
Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) plans to clear the Boeing 737 MAX to fly again next week, 22 months after 
the plane was grounded following two fatal crashes."For us, the MAX will be able to fly again starting next week," 
after publication of a directive, EASA director Patrick Ky said in a video conference."We have reached the point 
where our four main demands have been fulfilled," Ky said during the conference, organised by the German 
association of aviation journalists.The MAX was grounded in March 2019 after two crashes that together killed 346 
people -- the 2018 Lion Air disaster in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines crash the following year.Investigators 
said a main cause of both crashes was a faulty flight handling system known as the Maneuvering Characteristics 
Augmentation System, or MCAS.Meant to keep the plane from stalling as it ascends, the automated system instead 
forced the nose of the plane downward.The findings plunged Boeing into crisis, with more than 650 orders for the 
737 MAX cancelled since last year. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered Boeing to revamp the jet 
and implement new pilot training protocols, before finally approving the plane for a return to service in November.Ky 
had already indicated in October that EU approval was likely after Boeing promised a new sensor would be added 
to prevent the type of problems that caused the crashes. 
Back in the skies soon Photo: AFP / Jason Redmond EASA approval means airlines worldwide will again be able to 
start using the 737 MAX for flights to and from Europe.Brazil has also cleared the plane for flights, and Canadian 
authorities said this week that approval was likely as soon as Wednesday.The 737 MAX crisis, combined with the 
decimation of air travel after the Covid-19 outbreak, prompted Boeing to cut tens of thousands of jobs and also 
sparked a leadership shake-up.The plane was meant to be Boeing's fuel-efficient flagship in the highly competitive 
market for narrow-body jets, where its European rival Airbus has been highly successful with its A320 family of 
planes for short- to medium-haul flights.This month, new Boeing CEO David Calhoun acknowledged that "we fell 
short of our values and expectations," after the company agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle US criminal charges 
that it defrauded regulators.Boeing also got a boost in December when Ireland's Ryanair said it had ordered 75 
more of the jets, the first major order since they were grounded.The company is hoping Covid-19 vaccination drives 
will help improve its fortunes this year, after Boeing delivered just 157 planes last year, a 59 percent slump."In 
2021, we'll continue taking the right actions to enhance our safety culture, preserve liquidity and transform our 
business for the future," chief financial officer Greg Smith said earlier this month.

EU Regulator To Clear Boeing 737 MAX Flights Next Week

Jan 19, 2021( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  The 
European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) plans to clear the Boeing 737 MAX to fly again next week, 22 
months after the plane was grounded following two fatal crashes. "For us, the MAX will be able to fly again starting 
next week," after publication of a directive, EASA director Patrick Ky said in a video conference. 
"We have reached the point where our four main demands have been fulfilled," Ky said during the conference, 
organised by the German association of aviation journalists. The MAX was grounded in March 2019 after two 
crashes that together killed 346 people -- the 2018 Lion Air disaster in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines crash the 
following year. Investigators said a main cause of both crashes was a faulty flight handling system known as the 
Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS. Meant to keep the plane from stalling as it ascends, 
the automated system instead forced the nose of the plane downward. The findings plunged Boeing into crisis, with 
more than 650 orders for the 737 MAX cancelled since last year. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
ordered Boeing to revamp the jet and implement new pilot training protocols, before finally approving the plane for a 
return to service in November. Ky had already indicated in October that EU approval was likely after Boeing 
promised a new sensor would be added to prevent the type of problems that caused the crashes. Back in the skies 
soon AFP / Jason Redmond  EASA approval means airlines worldwide will again be able to start using the 737 
MAX for flights to and from Europe. Brazil has also cleared the plane for flights, and Canadian authorities said this 
week that approval was likely as soon as Wednesday. The 737 MAX crisis, combined with the decimation of air 
travel after the Covid-19 outbreak, prompted Boeing to cut tens of thousands of jobs and also sparked a leadership 
shake-up. The plane was meant to be Boeing's fuel-efficient flagship in the highly competitive market for narrow-
body jets, where its European rival Airbus has been highly successful with its A320 family of planes for short- to 
medium-haul flights. This month, new Boeing CEO David Calhoun acknowledged that "we fell short of our values 
and expectations," after the company agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle US criminal charges that it defrauded 
regulators. Boeing also got a boost in December when Ireland's Ryanair said it had ordered 75 more of the jets, the 
first major order since they were grounded. The company is hoping Covid-19 vaccination drives will help improve its 
fortunes this year, after Boeing delivered just 157 planes last year, a 59 percent slump. "In 2021, we'll continue 
taking the right actions to enhance our safety culture, preserve liquidity and transform our business for the future," 
chief financial officer Greg Smith said earlier this month.

Jan 14, 2021( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Already 
grounded by the coronavirus pandemic, airlines operating in the UK are facing post-Brexit obstacles to flying across 
the European Union, and their shareholders are paying the price.The trade agreement reached ahead of Britain's 
recent formal divorce from the EU allows flights between the two to continue as before.But for airlines with fewer 
than 50 percent EU-based shareholders, flights within the European Union require a new agreement by the end of 
2021."To continue being able to access these intra-European traffic rights, airlines need to demonstrate they are 
majority-owned and controlled by European persons," noted Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska.No-frills airlines, such 
as Ryanair and EasyJet, are notably affected, with their business model based heavily on flying customers across 
the European Union, such as French and German tourists to holiday destinations in Spain and Greece. "There has 
been sufficient time to prepare" for the changes, said independent aviation analyst John Strickland, with Britain 
voting in favour of exiting the EU 4.5 years ago.However the required changes in shareholder ownership "adds 
additional cost and complexity", he said, at at time when the global aviation sector is suffering huge losses on Covid 
fallout."Such (ownership) constraints do not exist in most other industries," Strickland told AFP. 
No-frills airlines, such as Ryanair and EasyJet, are notably affected, with their business model based heavily on 
flying customers across the European Union Photo: AFP / JUSTIN TALLIS "Ensuring safety and strong competition 
should be the primary areas of focus, not ownership limitations," he stressed.Alongside limiting non-EU ownership 
to less than 50 percent, British Airways-parent IAG has decided that the majority of its independent executives must 
be from within the bloc.Spelling out the extent of the restrictions, Ryanair has stated that its non-EU shareholders 
"shall not be entitled to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the company".EasyJet meanwhile states 
that "if non-EU ownership continues to exceed the permitted maximum over a sustained period", the airline "retains 
the right to activate the existing provisions of its articles that permit it to compel non-EU shareholders to sell their... 
shares to EU nationals".While EU stakeholders currently own a combined 47.5 percent of EasyJet, just short of the 
threshold, the airline has yet to force sales of its shares."Some airlines have indicated they may require shares to 
be sold but it is not an objective," said Strickland."Anything that adds cost and administrative burden is unwelcome 
but it will not have a noticeable impact on competitiveness."Airlines have already incurred costs over the need for 
new operating licences to continue flying in Britain and the European Union in the wake of Brexit."Like the many 'i's 
to be dotted and 't's to be crossed as the Brexit implications are unravelled, there is speculation the new ownership 
rules could be relaxed," noted Susannah Streeter, analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown."In the meantime 
this is another lingering headache airlines are having to deal with amid the continuing coronavirus crisis."

Budget airline Wizz Air is set to pay borrowing costs of just over 1 per cent on its debut bond, underscoring how 
buoyant credit markets remain in the face of fresh lockdowns and the spread of a new virus variant in Europe.
The London-listed Hungarian carrier followed a string of European companies that have issued debt at low interest 
rates in the first two weeks of 2021, highlighting investors' confidence in central banks' ability to mitigate the 
protracted economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis.
Wizz Air's deal shows how fund managers are increasingly willing to buy bonds from even deeply troubled sectors 
such as the airline industry - where activity has ground to a near halt for the best part of the year - in the search for 
any form of returns.
In December, 665,722 passengers travelled with Wizz Air, an 80 per cent drop compared with the same month in 
2019, according to the company's figures.
The European corporate bond market has experienced a frenzied start to the year, with investment grade-rated 
companies at the higher end of the ratings scale borrowing at historically low yields from investors flush with cash.
German energy company Eon raised (EURO)600m at a coupon of 0.1 per cent this week while Swiss engineering 
group ABB was able to borrow (EURO)800m with no interest payments.
Wizz Air takes advantage of low-cost borrowing in debut bond issuance Fixed income
"Available funding costs have never been better," said Mark Lynagh, co-head of Emea debt markets at BNP 
Paribas.
Wizz Air sold (EURO)500m of three-year bonds at an interest rate of just 1.35 per cent yesterday after receiving 
more than (EURO)2bn of orders from investors.
The budget airline carries credit ratings at the lowest rung of investment grade with a "negative" outlook from 
agencies Moody's and Fitch, indicating that it could slip into junk status in the near future. "[The volume of demand] 
demonstrates how much money is out there and that investors want to put it into something with a bit of [yield]," 
said Matt Thomas, head of UK corporate debt capital markets at Barclays, who worked on the deal.
He added that Wizz Air had a highquality balance sheet and that it had "come through an incredibly difficult 2020".
One UK-based fund manager said: "For so many deals, the [order] books are huge. People are having to buy 
[corporate debt] and they're nervous doing it."
Wizz Air plans to capitalise on the collapse in air travel by expanding its bases in Europe while ailing rivals recede.
One debt fund manager said that the carrier had followed rival Ryanair's model of keeping both costs and ticket 
prices low.
"It's the first part of the air travel segment that will really bounce back," he said, adding that Wizz Air had proved its 
"ability to switch on routes very quickly when there's a small opening in lockdowns."

Budget airline Wizz Air is set to pay borrowing costs of just over 1 per cent on its debut bond, underscoring how 
buoyant credit markets remain in the face of fresh lockdowns and the spread of a new virus variant in Europe.
The London-listed Hungarian carrier followed a string of European companies that have issued debt at low interest 
rates in the first two weeks of 2021, highlighting investors' confidence in central banks' ability to mitigate the 
protracted economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis.
Wizz Air's deal shows how fund managers are increasingly willing to buy bonds from even deeply troubled sectors 
such as the airline industry - where activity has ground to a near halt for the best part of the year - in the search for 
any form of returns.
In December, 665,722 passengers travelled with Wizz Air, an 80 per cent drop compared with the same month in 
2019, according to the company's figures.
The European corporate bond market has experienced a frenzied start to the year, with investment grade-rated 
companies at the higher end of the ratings scale borrowing at historically low yields from investors flush with cash.
German energy company Eon raised (EURO)600m at a coupon of 0.1 per cent this week while Swiss engineering 
group ABB was able to borrow (EURO)800m with no interest payments.

"Available funding costs have never been better," said Mark Lynagh, co-head of Emea debt markets at BNP 
Paribas.
Wizz Air sold (EURO)500m of three-year bonds at an interest rate of just 1.35 per cent yesterday after receiving 
more than (EURO)2bn of orders from investors.
The budget airline carries credit ratings at the lowest rung of investment grade with a "negative" outlook from 
agencies Moody's and Fitch, indicating that it could slip into junk status in the near future. "[The volume of demand] 
demonstrates how much money is out there and that investors want to put it into something with a bit of [yield]," 
said Matt Thomas, head of UK corporate debt capital markets at Barclays, who worked on the deal.
He added that Wizz Air had a highquality balance sheet and that it had "come through an incredibly difficult 2020".
One UK-based fund manager said: "For so many deals, the [order] books are huge. People are having to buy 
[corporate debt] and they're nervous doing it."
Wizz Air plans to capitalise on the collapse in air travel by expanding its bases in Europe while ailing rivals recede.
One debt fund manager said that the carrier had followed rival Ryanair's model of keeping both costs and ticket 
prices low.
"It's the first part of the air travel segment that will really bounce back," he said, adding that Wizz Air had proved its 
"ability to switch on routes very quickly when there's a small opening in lockdowns."

Brexit Adds To Airline Virus Woes In Britain

Jan 14, 2021( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  Already 
grounded by the coronavirus pandemic, airlines operating in the UK are facing post-Brexit obstacles to flying across 
the European Union, and their shareholders are paying the price. The trade agreement reached ahead of Britain's 
recent formal divorce from the EU allows flights between the two to continue as before. 
But for airlines with fewer than 50 percent EU-based shareholders, flights within the European Union require a new 
agreement by the end of 2021. "To continue being able to access these intra-European traffic rights, airlines need 
to demonstrate they are majority-owned and controlled by European persons," noted Bernstein analyst Daniel 
Roeska. No-frills airlines, such as Ryanair and EasyJet, are notably affected, with their business model based 
heavily on flying customers across the European Union, such as French and German tourists to holiday 
destinations in Spain and Greece."There has been sufficient time to prepare" for the changes, said independent 
aviation analyst John Strickland, with Britain voting in favour of exiting the EU 4.5 years ago. However the required 
changes in shareholder ownership "adds additional cost and complexity", he said, at at time when the global 
aviation sector is suffering huge losses on Covid fallout. "Such (ownership) constraints do not exist in most other 
industries," Strickland told AFP. No-frills airlines, such as Ryanair and EasyJet, are notably affected, with their 
business model based heavily on flying customers across the European Union AFP / JUSTIN TALLIS "Ensuring 
safety and strong competition should be the primary areas of focus, not ownership limitations," he stressed. 
Alongside limiting non-EU ownership to less than 50 percent, British Airways-parent IAG has decided that the 
majority of its independent executives must be from within the bloc. Spelling out the extent of the restrictions, 
Ryanair has stated that its non-EU shareholders "shall not be entitled to attend, speak or vote at any general 
meeting of the company". EasyJet meanwhile states that "if non-EU ownership continues to exceed the permitted 
maximum over a sustained period", the airline "retains the right to activate the existing provisions of its articles that 
permit it to compel non-EU shareholders to sell their... shares to EU nationals". While EU stakeholders currently 
own a combined 47.5 percent of EasyJet, just short of the threshold, the airline has yet to force sales of its shares. 
"Some airlines have indicated they may require shares to be sold but it is not an objective," said Strickland. 
"Anything that adds cost and administrative burden is unwelcome but it will not have a noticeable impact on 
competitiveness." Airlines have already incurred costs over the need for new operating licences to continue flying in 
Britain and the European Union in the wake of Brexit. "Like the many 'i's to be dotted and 't's to be crossed as the 
Brexit implications are unravelled, there is speculation the new ownership rules could be relaxed," noted Susannah 
Streeter, analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown. "In the meantime this is another lingering headache 
airlines are having to deal with amid the continuing coronavirus crisis."

Potential vaccination missteps keeping GAM’s Gallagher up at night
Potential vaccination missteps keeping GAM’s Gallagher up at night
Citywire

Highlight: Fears over incoherent policy could disrupt proper reopening of economies, says Citywire A-rated 
manager.
Body
Disruption or delays to the Covid-19 vaccination roll-out is the biggest challenge facing Citywire A-rated Niall 
Gallagher in 2021, the European equity specialist has announced.
Outlining his views for the year ahead, Gallagher, who runs GAM Continental European Equity , GAM Star 
European Equity  and GAM Star Continental European Equity  funds, said the vaccination and its success cannot 
be ignored.
When directly asked what would keep him up at night in the year ahead, Gallagher wrote: ‘I think there are a few 
things that could go wrong in 2021.
‘The biggest is if for some reason the vaccine roll-out is disrupted or slower than anticipated. However I do not 
worry as much about that as I do about policymakers taking a very stringent view on what vaccination, or full 
vaccination, actually means.
‘We think in terms of risks and probabilities; we would probably say that once you vaccinate those who live and 
work in care homes, frontline medical staff, over 80s, over 75s, you have captured much of the risk.’
Gallagher believes the main economic risk is that policymakers in the UK and elsewhere actually define the bar for 
safety at a much younger age, which would lengthen the roll-out of the vaccination. ‘That would disrupt the opening 
up of economies,’ Gallagher said.
Gallagher said the development of vaccines had added positivity to markets at the end of 2020. He said this lifted 
fundamentally solid businesses which had been hurt by the pandemic, notably budget airline Ryanair and booking 
software company Amadeus.
Ryanair is currently a 3.01% position in the €341m GAM Star European Equity fund as of the end of November, 
according to Morningstar data. This is while it is the second largest position in the €606m GAM Star Continental 
European Equity fund, accounting for 3.92% of exposure.
Potential vaccination missteps keeping GAM’s Gallagher up at night
However, Gallagher said his best-performing stock for the year was Dutch payment company Adyen, which he 
bought into at the end of 2019. ‘Post-IPO it did nothing for quite some time, but we began to look at it seriously 
towards the end of 2019 and initiated a position.
‘A number of things have helped it, including the pre-existing trends towards greater use of e-commerce in 
transactions between consumers and businesses and that has helped this. We believe it is the best in class globally 
at what it does – Stripe in the US is potentially a competitor but no one in Europe comes close.’
Morningstar does not show how large Gallagher’s position is in Adyen. The top stock in both the Continental 
European Equity and European Equity funds was LVMH, which was a 4.8% position as at the end of November in 
the larger fund and 5.05% in the smaller.
In terms of performance, Gallagher sits in the top quartile in the more-populated Equity – European sector. He sits 
53rd out of 599, having returned 21.7% in euro terms to the end of November 2020. The average peer returned 
4.7% over the same period.

Boeing Reports Lowest Annual Deliveries In Decades

       Boeing reported a sharp drop in orders and deliveries across its commercial and defense operations in fiscal 
2020, despite a slight growth in December with the return of its long grounded 737 MAX to service. The annual 
deliveries are the airplane maker's lowest since 1978.
 The company handed over 59 jets in the fourth quarter, and 157 jets in fiscal 2020. These include cargo and 
military planes. In comparison, deliveries in previous year's fourth quarter were 79 units, while fiscal 2019 deliveries 
were 380 units.
 However, deliveries for the month of December were 39, higher than prior year's 35.
 Boeing's deliveries for the year are way behind its major rival Airbus SE, which reportedly delivered 566 aircraft 
during the year 2020, lower than the previous year's deliveries of 863 units.
 In 2020, Boeing's gross orders were 184 units, including 117 in the fourth quarter. There were no orders in the 
month of October.
 In the year 2019, Boeing's net orders were 241. Meanwhile, in 2018, prior to the 737 MAX crisis, net orders were 
874.
 There were 4,997 unfilled orders as of December 31, including 4029 for 737 and 513 for 787.
 Greg Smith, Boeing executive vice president of Enterprise Operations and chief financial officer, said, "Through the 
global pandemic, we took meaningful steps to adapt to our new market, transform our business and deliver for our 
commercial, defense, space and services customers in 2020. The resumption of 737 MAX deliveries in December 
was a key milestone as we strengthen safety and quality across our enterprise." 
Boeing Reports Lowest Annual Deliveries In Decades
 Boeing was struggling with the grounding of its most popular and best-selling aircraft 737 MAX since March 2019 
following two deadly crashes. The company also halted deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner due to manufacturing 
defects.
 However, in mid November last year, the Federal Aviation Administration lifted its 20-month safety ban on the 737 
Max aircraft, and on November 30, it issued first airworthiness certificate for one of the new Boeing 737 Max jets.
 In December, Alaska Airlines ordered another 23 Boeing 737 MAXs, bringing its total order to 68 MAXs. The 737 
MAXs will replace most of the Airbus aircraft in Alaska's fleet. Earlier in December, Ryanair Holdings plc placed a 
firm order for 75 additional 737 MAX aircraft, increasing its order book to 210 jets.
 In its latest delivery statement, Boeing said it continued comprehensive inspections of 787 airplanes to ensure they 
meet highest quality standards prior to delivery.
 The company added that its working closely with global customers amid the pandemic, and monitoring the slow 
international traffic recovery to align supply with market demand across its widebody programs.

Jan 13, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With renewed lockdowns 
in the UK, Ireland and some other countries in Europe following the surge in coronavirus cases with the new COVID 
strain being found in the United Kingdom last month, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] 
trimmed its forecast for fiscal 2021 (ending Mar 31, 2021) traffic.Delta Air Lines DAL[2] and United Airlines UAL[3] 
were also in news, courtesy of their managerial decisions to revise their policies pertaining to emotional support 
animals on their flights. The move followed theU.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) decision to tighten the 
rule pertaining to passengers travelling with service animals on board.Update on American Airlines' AAL[4] move on 
the above issue was mentioned in the previous week's write-up[5].Meanwhile, gross revenues at the Latin 
American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[6] surged 52% to R$852 million in December on a month-over-month basis as 
air-travel demand picks up in the carrier's domestic markets. Notably, Gol is currently operating all the bases in its 
domestic network Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Ryanair expects its January traffic to be less 
than 1.25 million. The expectation is much less than the air traffic of 1.9 million recorded in December. 
The effect of a fresh shutdown is expected to be more emphatic on the traffic numbers of February and March. This 
European carrier, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects traffic in each of these two months to be as 
low as 500,000. Naturally, the carrier lowered its traffic forecast for fiscal 2021. It now expects[7] the metric for the 
period in the 26-30 million range compared with its earlier prediction of below 35 million. You can see the complete 
list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8].2. From Jan 11, 2021, United Airlines is allowing only 
service animals to accompany passengers in cabins free of cost. However, for tickets booked before the said date 
to travel on or before Feb 28, 2021, the airline is continuing with its usual policy of transporting emotional support 
animals free of cost. Customers planning to fly with their animals (that are not service animals) after Feb 28 will 
have to pay a service charge of $125 each way for carrying them in cabins or in cargo hold.Delta is also not 
accepting bookings pertaining to emotional support animals on its flights Jan 11 onward. However, the carrier is 
allowing passengers, who already booked tickets prior to the specified date, to travel with their emotional support 
animal(s) as scheduled. Per the DOT's new ruling, only dogs qualify as service animals. Going by the more 
stringent regulation, a service animal is defined as a 'dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for 
the benefit of a person with a disability'.3. Gol Linhas' management stated that load factor (% of seats filled by 
passengers) was 81% in December, reflecting the uptick in air-travel demand. This January, the airline plans to

operate approximately 550 flights per day and nearly 620 daily flights on peak days, representing 65% of last 
January's domestic flight schedule. For the fourth quarter of 2020 (detailed results of which will be available on Feb 
25), Gol Linhas estimates EBITDA margin to be 30-32%. Meanwhile, EBIT margin is expected to be 18-20%. 
Average fuel price per liter is anticipated between R$2.31 and R$2.37. Total demand and capacity are expected to 
be down 42% each in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, total seats are estimated to plunge 46% year over year[9].4 At 
Azul AZUL[10], consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger kilometers) declined 31.4% year over year to 
2.03 billion due to a 10.6% drop on the domestic front and an 85.3% fall, internationally. On a year-over-year basis, 
consolidated capacity (measured in available seat kilometers) decreased 28.4% to 2.54 billion. This downside was 
caused by a 9% contraction in domestic capacity and an 81.4% plunge in international capacity. With traffic decline 
outpacing capacity reduction, load factor deteriorated 350 basis points to 80%[11].5. As air-travel demand for 
leisure continues to improve, Alaska Air Group's ALK[12] subsidiary Alaska Airlines plans to introduce two routes 
from Southern California during the spring season. Starting Mar 18, 2021, the airline will begin a daily non-stop 
service connecting Los Angeles and Austin. On May 20, services on this route will increase to three departures on a 
daily basis. With the new flight service to Austin, the carrier will fly to more than 40 non-stop destinations from Los 
Angeles this spring. Moreover, a daily non-stop flight between San Diego and New York will commence on Apr 4. 
This nonstop operation is part of Alaska Air's expansion in the Northeast. During springtime, the airline will have a 
non-stop service connecting San Diego with both Newark and Boston. Performance The following table shows the

Jan 13, 2021( Medical Xpress: http://medicalxpress.com Delivered by Newstex)  A global maker of wipes and toilet 
paper has created a stink among its French employees after asking them to carry a device that goes off if they 
violate social distancing rules in the workplace.  The personal alarm[1] system emits a warning sound of 85 decibels 
about the same as a lawnmower if the wearer gets too close to a colleague, according to outraged union[2] 
representatives at the group. 
It is set to be trialled at the French sites of personal hygiene specialist Essity, a Swedish company that makes hand 
soap, tissues, sanitary products and napkins.  The CFDT union denounced the alarms as "a system comparable to 
ones that try to dissuade dogs from barking," adding that it would be stressful and "infantilising" for employees.  
Reached for comment at the company's headquarters, spokesman Karl Stoltz told AFP that "it is just tested in 
France".  Employees have been told that the alarms are for their own safety and that the devices will be deactivated 
in the company canteen, toilets and medical areas. The sensors will not be personalised and do not have a system 
enabling the company to locate them, according to management. The proposals are set to be discussed at a 
personnel meeting next week, but employees are already warning that the devices will end up like many of the 
company's single-use products.  Christine Duguet, a union representative from the CFDT, predicted that "they'll 
finish in the rubbish bins or stay in a cupboard. This is complete nonsense." Explore further France slams Ryanair

Boeing deliveries drop despite 737 Max's return to flight
Boeing deliveries drop despite 737 Max's return to flight

Boeing Co. got a bump in orders and deliveries of new planes in December, but it wasn't enough to salvage a poor 
year for the big aircraft maker.
Chicago-based Boeing still reported more cancellations than new orders for its 737 Max jet, which was grounded for 
21 months after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people.
The market for new planes remains depressed by the pandemic, which has devastated air travel and caused 
airlines to reconsider aircraft purchases. Despite the December numbers, Boeing’s full-year numbers for 2020 still 
declined from 2019.
Boeing finished 2020 with 157 deliveries, including planes handed over to cargo airlines and military customers. 
That was down from 380 deliveries in 2019. European rival Airbus finished the year with 566 deliveries.
Deliveries are crucial because aircraft makers get much of their cash when planes are delivered. Short on cash 
during the Max grounding, Boeing has borrowed billions and cut thousands of jobs to reduce costs.
The Federal Aviation Administration's decision in November to approve changes to a flight-control system on the 
Max allowed Boeing to resume shipping previously built Maxes to airline customers. Boeing delivered 39 planes in 
December, including 27 Maxes, of which 10 went to American Airlines and eight to United Airlines.
However, Boeing delivered none of its larger 787 jets as it worked to fix manufacturing problems where sections are 
the fuselage come together.
Boeing reported 90 new orders in December. The bulk, 75, came in a single previously announced order by Irish 
discount airline Ryanair. The total included cargo carrier DHL's order for eight Boeing 777 freighters, which was 
announced Tuesday.
However, Boeing also reported canceled orders for 105 Max planes, all but five by leasing companies that fear it 
will be difficult to find operators to take the planes.
Boeing deliveries drop despite 737 Max's return to flight
The totals don't include Alaska Airlines' decision to buy 23 more Max jets. That deal was announced last month but 
will be reported with January orders, a Boeing spokesman said.
For 2020, orders fell to 184 from 246 in 2019.
Airbus reported 383 orders in 2020.
Boeing said it has a backlog of nearly 3,300 unfilled orders for the Max and about 4,200 for all planes, including 
cargo freighters.
___
This story has been updated to correct that Boeing delivered 27 Max planes in December, not 28.

Jan 12, 2021( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Boeing on 
Tuesday reported a plunge in annual plane deliveries and a diminished order backlog as it contended with dual 
crises caused by the 737 MAX grounding and the travel industry downturn brought about by Covid-19.The figures 
offer the final tally of a bruising year that forced Boeing in March to seek a bailout from Washington as it faced 
existential questions during the apex of both crises. Boeing was successful in obtaining the aid, but turned to private 
support instead.Boeing, which has cut tens of thousands of jobs amid its struggles, delivered just 157 planes last 
year, down 59 percent from 2019.The company's backlog at the end of 2020 stood at 4,223, down from nearly 
5,900 planes at the end of 2018, when the airline industry was still in growth mode prior to Covid-19 and the MAX 
was still flying.Airlines in 2020 canceled 641 orders for the MAX, which was cleared later that year to resume flights 
in the United States and some other markets following a 20-month grounding after two fatal crashes. The tally -- 
which left Boeing far below rival Airbus in annual deliveries -- concludes a year that began with newly-installed 
Chief Executive Dave Calhoun pushing back the targeted return of the MAX and endorsing enhanced training for its 
pilots.Both were efforts to repair the aerospace giant's relationship with US air safety regulators following two 
crashes of the jet that killed 346 people.With the MAX still grounded and facing myriad questions, Boeing's 
prospects took a major hit in March as airline travel declined to a trickle when the United States and other major 
economies shut down to counter Covid-19.Faced with questions over its long-term survival, Boeing mounted a 
campaign in Washington for a federal bailout, ultimately garnering a measure for $17 billion in relief under the 
CARES Act package in March.

December numbers, Boeing's full-year numbers for 2020 still declined from 2019. Boeing finished 2020 with 157 
deliveries, including planes handed over to cargo airlines and military customers. That was down from 380 
deliveries in 2019. European rival Airbus finished the year with 566 deliveries. Deliveries are crucial because 
aircraft makers get much of their cash when planes are delivered. Short on cash during the Max grounding, Boeing 
has borrowed billions and cut thousands of jobs to reduce costs. The Federal Aviation Administration's decision in 
November to approve changes to a flight-control system on the Max allowed Boeing to resume shipping previously 
built Maxes to airline customers. Boeing delivered 39 planes in December, including 28 Maxes, of which 10 went to 
American Airlines and eight to United Airlines. Boeing reported 90 new orders in December. The bulk, 75, came in a 
single previously announced order by Irish discount airline Ryanair. The total included cargo carrier DHL's order for 
eight Boeing 777 freighters, which was announced Tuesday. However, Boeing also reported canceled orders for 
105 Max planes, all but five by leasing companies that fear it will be difficult to find operators to take the planes. The 
totals don't include Alaska Airlines' decision to buy 23 more Max jets. That deal was announced last month but will 
be reported with January orders, a Boeing spokesman said. (Ad) This stock could be a major success story in 2021. 
For 2020, orders fell to 184 from 246 in 2019. Airbus reported 383 orders in 2020. Boeing said it has a backlog of 
nearly 3,300 unfilled orders for the Max and about 4,200 for all planes, including cargo freighters. Companies

Body
Last year will not be looked back on fondly by most people, but for many investors it ended up being a bumper 12 
months.
Those of us who had exposure to technology, biotech, gold, and Asia – China, Japan and Korea, in particular – will 
be patting ourselves on the back. By contrast, value investments struggled in 2020, even after November’s bounce, 
and many sectors were hit hard by lockdown restrictions. 
The first question for 2021, is: how quickly will Covid-hit businesses bounce back once vaccination programmes 
allow the resumption of ‘normal’ economic activity?  
It feels to me as though the Doric Nimrod  and Amedeo  aircraft leasing funds that own A380s will not make a full 
recovery. As I said last month in connection to Baillie Gifford European Growth’s  holding in Ryanair, short-haul and 
leisure-focused airlines may see a sharp bounce later in the year, but business travel may have taken a permanent 
hit.
Airlines are accelerating the retirement of their A380 fleet. That will leave a big hole in the net asset values of these 
funds. 
The leisure sector was also a casualty. Symphony International , Macau Property Opportunities  and Secure 
Income  real estate investment trust all feature among the list of worst-performing investment companies over 
2020 and trade on wide discounts.
Asian private equity investor Symphony has big exposure to restaurants and hotels. Macau has placed restrictions 
on visitors, hitting its gaming revenue and much reducing MPO’s chances of selling its remaining property in its 
wind-down. Secure Income is exposed to Travelodge and the leisure business, Merlin Entertainments.  
I think there is scope for NAV recovery and discount narrowing for each of these in 2021. Secure Income might be 
the safest bet and offers 50% upside if it can return to the levels it was trading at ahead of the pandemic panic last 
March. I’m thinking about buying some at these levels. 
James Carthew: The 2021 trust recovery stories I’m betting on
Elsewhere in the property sector, trusts such as Standard Life Investments Property Income  and BMO Commercial 
Property  have bounced from their lows but remain well-below the levels that they were trading at last year. My 
feeling is that most of these are oversold.
For example, well over half of SLI’s portfolio is in industrial property, which is set fair. Pure play industrial/logistics 
funds such as the two Tritax funds  in the UK and EBOX  in Europe and Aberdeen Standard European Logistics 
Income , should continue to prosper. 
GCP Student Living   and Empiric Student Property  – the latter of which I hold and added to in April and July last 
year – bounced in November, but could climb further if it looks as though occupancy rates will pick up for the 
2021/2022 academic year. 
The second wave of coronavirus has not stalled the recovery in the UK stock market. Putting Brexit behind us may 
have helped sentiment but I wonder when investors’ attention will turn to government finances and the possibility of 
higher taxes?
The Democratic party’s success in the Georgia Senate run-offs has already triggered an uptick in US bond 
yields but I don’t expect a surge in interest rates or inflation in 2021. Sensibly managed loan/bond funds, such 
as Henderson Diversified Income,  should be fine.
Elsewhere, in the debt sectors, I would be wary of gambling on a recovery in the fortunes of those direct lending 
funds that fell out of bed last year. 
I think stock selection will continue to be the main driver of returns in developed equity markets this year. Here, it 
will be interesting to watch the value versus growth debate play out again. For value, Temple Bar,  now under new 
management, was one of the worst performing trusts last year but its discount is narrowing. 
In the growth camp, Baillie Gifford’s trusts dominated the performance league tables in 2020. Much as I’d love my 
Monks  and Edinburgh Worldwide  positions to soar again in 2021, I wouldn’t be surprised to see them pause for 
breath. 
I remain enthusiastic about the prospects for emerging market and Asian trusts and have a lot of exposure to these 
areas, although I am still kicking myself for top slicing my JPMorgan China Growth and Income  holding last April. 
Many of these countries have managed to get through this crisis without enormous economic stimulus. They should 
also benefit as global economic growth picks up.  
I am hoping that the trade war will ease when Trump finally exits the White House. Latin American funds are off 
their lows but there could be more to go for. My cash in the liquidated JPMorgan Brazil  is yet to be reinvested but I 
am sitting on a nice profit on my Ceiba Investments  Cuban property fund holding and expect that it will continue 
to climb this year as restrictions on US citizens visiting and investing in Cuba are eased. 
The Democrat win is also a shot in the arm for the renewable energy sector in the US. That is potentially good news 
for US Solar , SDCL Energy Efficiency Income   and newcomer Ecofin US Renewables Infrastructure (RNEW). I 
wouldn’t be surprised if each of these managed to raise more money this year. 
In the UK too, the government’s pledge to build back greener may help UK-focused renewable funds and GCP 
Infrastructure  which has a sizeable exposure to the renewables sector. 
One other of my holdings that I am optimistic about for 2021 is Hipgnosis Songs Fund.  I think we might see further 
progress in its NAV and decent revenue growth (helped by additional leverage).
I am also conscious that it has been fighting with one hand tied behind its back given the lack of live music. The 
lifting of Covid restrictions will provide a further boost to revenue at some point.

weren't happy about was their 'magic bag' TV advert. The ad saw a woman collecting a Mary Poppins-style bag 
containing meals from numerous different restaurants[7], which, as anyone who has ordered from Deliveroo before 
will know, isn't actually possible on the app. Amazon Europe followed in second place, with 299 complaints across 
eight different rulings. The majority of complaints related to the one-day delivery service, part of Amazon Prime 
Membership. Customers complained that their packages didn't arrive within the promised time, and that many items 
are not available for next day delivery. Ryanair ranked at No.5 with 183 complaints made by consumers. This is 
expected to increase following the controversy caused by their recent 'jab and go' advert. The ASA have launched 
an investigation to see whether the budget airline broke advertising rules.The Top 5 Most Commonly Complained 
About Topics The most complained about topic was 'food, drink and supplements', with a total of 757 complaints. 
This included the misleading Deliveroo advert mentioned above, as well as ads from KFC and Philadelphia. The 
research also analyses a total of 1,935 complaints made to the ASA over the last five years or so - of which, the 
vast 
majority 
were 
upheld 
to 
some 
degree.

Ryanair cuts flights after fresh lockdowns Airlines

Ryanair warned that it would carry even fewer passengers than forecast this year after slashing its winter flight 
schedules in response to the new wave of lockdowns and travel restrictions in the UK and Europe.
The low-cost carrier said it expected to run few, if any, flights to and from the UK and Ireland from the end of 
January until restrictions on movements were eased. As a result, Ryanair has revised down its passenger forecast 
for the year to March, from below 35m to between 26m to 30m passengers - less than a fifth of the 149m it carried 
in the previous financial year.
The airline also called on the British and Irish governments to speed up their vaccination programmes and said 
"vaccinations rather than lockdowns is the way out of this Covid-19 crisis".
The changes illustrate how the winter season is turning out to be even worse than expected for Europe's airlines, 
despite Ryanair's expectation that reductions will not hit profitability as the flights were lossmaking.
The group's passenger numbers in January are expected to fall to under 1.25m, and then dip to 500,000 in 
February and March - the lowest since air travel all but stopped last spring.
In the UK, Boris Johnson's government ordered its third national lockdown since March this week following a rapid 
rise in coronavirus infections.
Ryanair cuts flights after fresh lockdowns Airlines
The prime minister has promised to review the measures, which include a travel ban for non-essential trips, in mid-
February.
Ireland tightened its lockdown after Christmas, including a ban on people entering from the UK that ends at 
midnight today. EasyJet and British Airways also plan to cut their flight schedules in response to the new 
lockdowns. Ryanair, easyJet and BA owner IAG all fell 3 per cent by mid-morning yesterday but closed down 1.68 
per cent, 0.1 per cent and 0.47 per cent respectively.

J Sainsbury rallied after the UK's secondlargest supermarket chain increased its guidance for full-year underlying 
pretax profit to £330m from £270m. "More customers bought their food online than ever before and we delivered 
11m orders in 10 days to Christmas, double the number of last year," said Simon Roberts, chief executive officer.
Shore Capital described the announcement as "a quite fabulous trading update".
Reiterating its "buy" rating, the broker added: "Sainsbury's has a firmer market share base than it would have 
expected a year ago, a much more profitable online capability [and] volume boosted working capital."
News that Mitchells & Butlers was considering raising fresh funds sent the pub group lower.
"The directors believe it is prudent to explore an equity capital raise, to give the group increased financial and 
operational flexibility," revealed M&B, which has been hit hard by coronavirus-link lockdowns.
M&B said trading in the three months to January 2 was 67 per cent below 2019 levels.
Ryanair dipped after the low-cost carrier revised down its passenger forecast for the year to March from below 35m 
to between 26m to 30m passengers. Ray Douglas

Jan 08, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Ryanair 
Holdings RYAAY[1] dipped 1.6% to $108.16 on Jan 7 following lackluster projections for January, February and 
March air traffic as well as for fiscal 2021 (ending Mar 31, 2021). The renewed lockdowns in the UK, Ireland and 
some other countries in the EU following the surge in coronavirus cases with a new strain being found in the United 
Kingdom last month induced such dull predictions. Experts believe that the new variant of the virus is potentially 
more contagious. What Did Ryanair Say?
 The Irish carrier perceives that the fresh lockdowns and other travel-related restrictions will shrink air-travel 
demand further, thus forcing it to cut its flight schedules from Jan 21. Following this decision, only a handful (if any) 
of flights will operate to/from Ireland or the UK until the removal of the travel embargo.As a result of the constraints, 
the low-cost carrier expects its traffic in the current month to be less than 1.25 million. The expectation is much less 
than the air traffic of 1.9 million recorded in December. The effect of a fresh shutdown is expected to be more 
pronounced on the traffic numbers of February and March. This European carrier expects traffic in each of the two 
months to be as low as 500,000. Naturally, the carrier trimmed its traffic forecast for fiscal 2021. It now expects the 
metric for the period in the 26-30 million range compared with its earlier prediction of below 35 million. However, 
Ryanair does not expect a material impact on its net loss for fiscal 2021 due to the lockdown-induced revisions. 
This is because many of the flights cancelled would have run at a loss.The 'slow pace of vaccine rollouts' in the UK 
and Ireland clearly left Ryanair frustrated. As a result, management appealed to the governments in those countries 
to accelerate the same. In fact, Ireland's sluggishness irked the carrier's executive leadership so much that the 
latter demanded an explanation from the former at an administrative level on why Denmark, which has a population 
equivalent to Ireland's 5 million, could complete vaccinating 40,000 people as of Jan 6, which is 10 times more than 
what Ireland could achieve until now. Zacks Rank &#38; Key Picks Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold). Investors interested in the broader Zacks Transportation sector may consider stocks like Ryder System R[2], 
FedEx Corporation FDX[3] and Herc Holdings HRI[4], each presently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You

Ryanair Calls for Faster Distribution of Coronavirus Vaccines After Cutting Full-Year Passenger Traffic

Ryanair Calls for Faster Distribution of Coronavirus Vaccines After Cutting 
Full-Year Passenger Traffic Forecast

 Ryanair (RYAAY), the biggest European budget airline, called on the Irish government to accelerate the "slow 
pace" of COVID-19 vaccine rollouts after cutting its full-year fiscal 2021 passenger traffic forecast.
The Dublin-based carrier said the Irish government needs to explain why Denmark, which has a population of about 
5 million, has vaccinated 40,000 citizens by Jan. 6, whereas Ireland whose population size is similar to that of 
Denmark, has vaccinated 4,000. The company also called on the UK government, which has approved two 
vaccines for distribution, to push for faster rollouts.
The company said the newly announced coronavirus lockdowns in Ireland, the UK, and a several other European 
Union countries, will "materially reduce" flight schedules and traffic forecast through January, February, and March. 
It anticipates January traffic will fall to fewer than 1.25 million. New restrictions could also cut February and March 
traffic to 500,000 passengers for each of the two months.
As a result, the airline has cut passenger traffic expectations to between 26 million and 30 million, versus its 
previous estimates of sub 35 million.
"Ireland's Covid-19 travel restrictions are already the most stringent in Europe, and so these new flight restrictions 
are inexplicable and ineffective when Ireland continues to operate an open border between the Republic and the 
North of Ireland," the company said in a statement. "Since Ireland's third lockdown will not get rid of the Covid virus, 
there is an onus on the Irish Government to accelerate the rollout of vaccines, and emergency action is needed to 
speed Covid vaccinations in Ireland."
The company called upon NPHET, Ireland's public health team, to now release a daily report of the number of 
vaccines administered in Ireland.
The cuts in flight schedules and traffic will, however, not have a "material affect" on the net loss Ryanair anticipates 
for the full-year to March 31 as many of these flights would have been run at a loss.

Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline, today briefed the markets that it now expects the newly announced Covid 
lockdowns in Ireland, the UK, and a small number of other EU countries this week, will materially reduce its flight 
schedules and traffic forecast through January, February and March. 
Ryanair now expects its Jan traffic to fall to under 1.25m passengers, and that new Covid restrictions could also 
reduce Feb and Mar traffic to as little as 500,000 passengers each month. In response, Ryanair will significantly cut 
its flight schedules from Thursday 21 January, which will result in few, if any, flights being operated to/from Ireland 
or the UK from the end of January until such time as these travel restrictions are removed. 
All customers affected by these further flight cancellations and further travel restrictions will receive emails advising 
them of their entitlements of free moves and/or refunds later today. These new cutbacks will reduce full year traffic 
forecast from currently “below 35m” to between 26m to 30m passengers.
Ryanair does not expect these flight cuts and further traffic reductions will materially affect its net loss for the year to 
31 March 2021 since many of these flights would have been loss making.
In a statement, a Spokesperson for Ryanair said, "Ireland’s Covid-19 travel restrictions are already the most 
stringent in Europe, and so these new flight restrictions are inexplicable and ineffective when Ireland continues to 
operate an open border between the Republic and the North of Ireland. Since Ireland’s third lockdown will not get 
rid of the Covid virus, there is an onus on the Irish  Government to accelerate the rollout of vaccines, and the fact 
that the Danish Government, with a similar 5m population, has already vaccinated 10 times more citizens than 
Ireland shows that emergency action is needed to speed Covid vaccinations in Ireland."

Equities Rise in Early Trading Amid Expectations for Higher US Stimulus After Democrats Win Georgia Runoff
Equities Rise in Early Trading Amid Expectations for Higher US Stimulus

 Equities rose in early trading Thursday as market participants anticipated the approval of a higher stimulus 
payment following this week's Democratic victory in Georgia's Senate runoff, while violent incidents in the Capitol 
that preceded Joe Biden's confirmation as president elect were shrugged off.
"Democrats picked up both Georgia Senate seats, paving the way for Biden to implement his agenda more broadly. 
This should result in additional stimulus, including the expansion of payments to individuals," Credit Suisse said in a 
report.
The approval of $600 in stimulus payments led equities to record highs late last year. The possibility of an increase 
to $2,000 as COVID-19 relief temporarily led to news gains that were erased after the Republican majority had 
stopped the initiative. Analysts at Credit Suisse and Pantheon Macroeconomics said that the Democratic control is 
not likely to translate into unbridled spending.
"Fiscal policy will be looser with Democrats controlling the Senate, but don't expect an explosion," said Ian 
Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He noted that Democrats would need in the Senate 
least 60 votes for fiscal measures.
Chaotic events Wednesday afternoon inside the Capitol were likely to be "no more than a temporary distraction," 
according to a report from Commerzbank. Commerzbank said traders were positioning for a path forward for further 
fiscal stimulus spending in the US.
On the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) led increases with a 4.7% rise after its 
fiscal first-quarter results came in ahead of expectations. JP Morgan Chase (JPM) gained 4.5%. 3M (MMM) and 
Goldman Sachs (GS) led declines with 4.2% and 1.6% drops, respectively.
On the Standard & Poor's 500 financials and information technology were leading gains, with rises of 2.2% and 
1.9%, respectively. Energy was 1.2% higher with crude oil prices little changed .

In company news, 3D Systems (DDD) surged 35% after the 3D printer makers said that it expects fourth quarter 
revenue to be as much as $176 million, higher than a consensus compiled by Capital IQ. Bed Bath & Beyond 
(BBBY) fell 8.2% after it reported fiscal third quarter adjusted earnings of $0.08 per share. Analysts polled by 
Capital IQ had projected adjusted EPS of $0.20.
Ryanair (RYAAY) fell 2.4% after the low-cost carrier said it expects to significantly cut its flight schedule through 
March due to newly announced lockdowns in Ireland, the UK, and other European Union countries. Plug Power 
(PLUG) rose 30% after South Korea's SK Group planned to make a $1.5 billion strategic investment in the 
company.
In morning trading, the Dow was up 0.8% and the S&P 500 was 1.4% higher, while the Nasdaq rose 2.1%.

       Low fares airline Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L, RYAAY) said it cut traffic forecast for the year ended 31 March 
2021 to below 30 million passengers from below 35 million passengers, citing the new COVID-19 lock-downs and 
travel restrictions in the Ireland and UK. It will significantly cut flight schedules from January 21 until travel 
restrictions in the U.K. and Ireland are removed.
 However, the airline does not expect the flight cuts and further traffic reductions will materially affect its net loss for 
the year to 31 March 2021 since many of those flights would have been loss making.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) said on Thursday that it now expects newly announced Covid lockdowns in Ireland, the UK, and

Ryanair said that the new cutbacks would lower its full year ending March 31 2021 traffic forecast from currently 
"below 35m" to between 26m to 30m passengers. The company said that it does not expect the flight cuts and 
further traffic reductions to materially affect its net loss for the year to March 31 2021 since many of the flights would 
have been loss-making.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) said Thursday the renewed COVID-19 lockdowns in the UK, Ireland and a few 
other countries in the European Union will hit its traffic guidance for the full fiscal year to March 31, 2021.
The full-year traffic forecast was revised to between 26 million and 30 million passengers, from the previous 
forecast of below 35 million passengers as the company decided to cut its flight scheduled from Jan. 21 in response 
to the restrictions.
The flight cuts and further traffic reductions are not expected to materially affect the net loss as many of the flights 
were expected to be loss-making.
The airline expects its January traffic to fall to under 1.3 million passengers, and February and March traffic to sink 
to 500,000 passengers each month.
Ryanair's shares climbed almost 5% on Wednesday's close.

 Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) shares climbed almost 5% on Wednesday's close as shareholders approved the 
replacement of CREST with a system operated by Euroclear Bank for the electronic settlement of trading of its 
ordinary shares.
The migration is expected to take place around March 15 along with the wider market migration of the shares of the 
listed Irish companies.
The move will provide long-term certainty to the Irish securities market in light of the UK's decision to leave the 
European Union.

LONDON (AP) — Britain's advertising watchdog has launched an investigation into budget carrier Ryanair, after 
receiving 1,600 complaints about an ad that suggested consumers should “jab & go.’’
The Advertising and Standards Authority said Monday that some consumers objected to the ad, which featured a 
syringe and a small bottle labeled “vaccine.’’
Some argued it was misleading to suggest the vaccine will be rolled out across the population by the spring and 
that travel restrictions would be over. Others objected to what they saw as the trivialization of the impact of the 
pandemic on society.
The ad promoted flights to sunny European destinations and offered seats for 19.99 pounds ($27), telling 
customers to “jab & go.”
Britain ramped up its vaccination program Monday by becoming the first nation to start using the shot developed by 
Oxford University and drugmaker AstraZeneca. But it's unclear how quickly the nation can be vaccinated, as it is a 
huge endeavor with little precedent.
The budget carrier said the ads were factually accurate, given that two vaccines have been approved for use in the 
U.K. It also confirmed that bookings could be changed without fees.
“Some critics wish to complain just for the sake of getting noticed when it is clear that vaccines will mean an end to 
Covid travel restrictions in mid-2021,” the carrier said in a statement.

Body
European air traffic controllers are anticipating a slow recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in the aviation sector 
this year, according to an analysis published in Brussels on Monday.
The European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) predicts flights and passengers at 
just 51 per cent of pre-crisis levels, following the cancellation of around 6.1 million flights and the loss of 1.7 billion 
passengers last year.
While airlines were the main beneficiaries of state assistance over the course of 2020, airports would be heavily 
reliant on state subsidies over the year ahead, the organization said.
"We're confident that the recovery will start to firm up in 2021 as the vaccine rolls out across the globe. However, 
it's clear that the entire aviation sector will continue to need financial support in the years ahead," EUROCONTROL 
director general Eamonn Brennan said.
According to the analysis, the Lufthansa Group had to cancel 67 per cent of its flights, as had Easyjet. IAG, which 
operates British Airways and Iberia, lost 65 per cent of its flights.
Ryanair flew 59 per cent fewer flights than in 2019 and Air France/KLM 55 per cent fewer.
Frankfurt lost its top spot in handling flights to Amsterdam, where the decline was lower.
At the end of the year, some 51 per cent of European airlines' fleets were grounded, totalling 4,118 of 8,048 planes. 
In April, the figure reached a peak of 87 per cent.

European airlines are stepping up pressure on airports to slash landing charges, leading to warnings of a race to 
the bottom in an industry decimated by the pandemic.
Ryanair, Wizz Air and easyJet are among those seeking lower fees as they decide where to fly when passengers 
begin returning in significant numbers.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, told the Financial Times that airports would be under "ferocious 
pressure" to recover their traffic levels.
He offered the example of his airline's expansion at Venice airport, where a new base and 18 new routes were 
announced in December following what Ryanair called "competitive" pricing.
"Aircraft numbers are going to move significantly to wherever we can get the best deals," he said.
Airports typically make up their income from a mix of landing fees and revenues from their own facilities, including 
retail, catering and car parking.
The collapse in passenger numbers during the pandemic has blown a hole in both these business lines.
Carriers seek cut in European landing fees Airlines Price pressure will lead to 'unsustainable race to the 
bottom', say airports
Olivier Jankovec, director-general of the airports lobby group ACI Europe, warned that airports' financial situations 
were worsening and the pressure to discount charges was unsustainable.
"When you hear from airlines like easyJet, Ryanair or Wizz Air, it is very clear they want to use the crisis as an 
opportunity to lower their costs ... We are basically at the moment in an airports beauty contest," he said.
"You can't expect airport charges to go down forever, that race to the bottom is not sustainable," he said, pointing to 
fixed costs such as air traffic control and other infrastructure that cannot be cut.
ACI Europe has estimated that 6,000 flight routes across Europe have been lost during the crisis, leaving airports 
competing to restore traffic.
At London's Heathrow, pandemic losses have prompted proposals to increase charges by 5 per cent, despite 
furious objections from some big airlines. British Airways said such a move was "fundamentally wrong".
Other carriers such as Wizz Air, a growing rival to Ryanair, have also focused on price when negotiating with 
airports during the pandemic. "There is a market price to everything. When airports are full the price goes up, and 
when airports are empty there is the ability to negotiate a better price," said Owain Jones, its UK managing director.
Andrew Findlay, chief financial officer of easyJet, said the carrier was in "ongoing discussions" over discounts with 
airports, and charges would be a "key area of focus".
Mr Jankovec said: "There is a lot of discounting at the moment ... but when we get to a stage of the recovery where 
we can see the new normal, then things need to balance out."

 European airlines including Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L, RY4C.IR), Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) and easyJet (EZJ.L) are 
seeking cuts in landing fees at airports amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Financial Times reported Jan. 2.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said that airlines are going to switch operations to the airports offering the 
best deals.
Meanwhile, airports lobby group ACI Europe's Director-General Olivier Jankovec said lowering costs was not 
sustainable for airports as it was not possible to cut fixed costs including air traffic control and other infrastructure.
Ryanair and Wizz Air were down almost 2%, and easyJet fell almost 3% at the close of trading on Dec. 31, 2020.

healthcare companies traded on public markets. Given the sheer number of pharmaceutical companies, medical 
research firms, hospital systems, and other healthcare stocks, it can be hard to identify which healthcare companies 
will outperform the market. Fortunately, Wall Street's brightest minds have already done this for us. Every year, 
analysts issue approximately 3,000 distinct recommendations for healthcare companies. Analysts don't always get 
their "buy" ratings right, but it's worth taking a hard look when several analysts from different brokerages and 
research firms are giving "strong-buy" and "buy" ratings to the same healthcare stock. This slide show lists the 15

MADRID (AP) — Blame COVID-19 travel restrictions or Brexit but whatever the cause, some British citizens trying 
to return to their homes in several European countries this weekend have been barred from boarding flights.
Airlines refused documents that before Brexit had been valid proof of the Britons' status as residents in Spain, Italy 
and Germany, although Spanish authorities claimed that the issue had been resolved by mid-Sunday.
Their ordeal came amid heightened travel restrictions due to a coronavirus variant that has been blamed for faster 
contagion in the U.K. and highlights the bureaucratic complexities resulting from Britain's departure from the 27-
nation European Union.
Both Spanish and British authorities said Sunday that the green-colored certificate of EU citizenship with a foreign 
national identification number issued by Spain is still valid for British citizens residing in Spain under the bilateral 
provisions that followed the U.K.’s withdrawal from the bloc on Dec. 31.
But the travelers say British Airways and Iberia, which are part of the IAG group, have been refusing to let them 
board for the past two days.
Iberia said in a statement late Sunday that a communication from Spain's border police on Jan. 1 had created 
“some confusion” and that it was later clarified. British Airways didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Around 300,000 British citizens are registered as permanent residents in Spain, although before Brexit, many more 
had been living full or part-time in the country without officially registering.
Patricia Moody, a 69-year-old retiree who has called the southern Spanish town of Zurgena home for nearly four 
years, was among a group of at least nine people unable to board a Madrid-bound BA/Iberia flight from London’s 
Heathrow Airport on Saturday.
Moody said she and her husband, who she says needs to see his doctor back in Spain, have spent 1,900 pounds 
($2,600) on getting tested for the virus, traveling to the airport and booking new tickets after they were refused 
boarding. Their second attempt was also futile.
Britons flying home to Spain caught in post-Brexit red tape
“Throughout all the months of negotiating Brexit, we were always assured that nothing would change for us,” she 
said. Referring to the airlines and authorities in both countries, she added: “It’s horrendous and we are suffering 
because of their incompetence.”
Following the discovery of the coronavirus variant in the U.K., many European nations have banned all travel from 
the British isles except for their own nationals and U.K. citizens with residency rights.
Travelers to Pisa, Italy, and Berlin have also reported similar hurdles in boarding planes operated by Ryanair and 
Lufthansa despite carrying documents that had been accepted by the Italian and German governments, 
respectively.
Matt Bristow, a spokesman for the British in Germany association of residents in that country, said: “This appears to 
be a case of U.K. airport staff not knowing what documents to accept or applying the rules more stringently than the 
German border police would."
Spain has been rolling out a new system to register permanent foreign residents called TIE but it’s suffering a 
backlog due to the high number of requests. Authorities told AP that proof of application for the TIE and the “green 
certificate” for EU citizens were still valid to travel for British residents under the new health restrictions in place until 
Jan. 19.
“This should not be happening,” said the U.K. embassy in Spain said in a Facebook post. “The Spanish authorities 
have today re-confirmed that the green residency document will be accepted for travel to return to Spain, as stated 
in our travel advice.”
But Sam Dakin, a 32-year-old English-language teacher based in Barcelona for the last four years, and his partner, 
who has been in the Spanish city for 8 years, said they needed more assurances before they could rebook flights.
The couple had been blocked from flying Saturday morning despite carrying their certificate and then were refused 
boarding on another flight Saturday evening that British Airways had initially said they could take.
“Just because the government adviser said that we could travel, we don’t know whether that will happen when we 
turn up at the counters," Dakin said. “We just don’t know where we’re going to get answers."
In a statement, Spain's Foreign Ministry said there had been “an isolated communication problem with some 
airlines that affected a very small number of travelers” and that air traffic between the U.K. and Spain was 
proceeding “with normality" by mid-Sunday.

BA wins state backing for £2bn recovery loan Airlines

British Airways will be temporarily barred from paying dividends to its parent, IAG, after securing a government 
guarantee for a £2bn loan, designed to help its recovery from turbulence caused by the coronavirus pandemic and 
the UK's exit from the EU.
IAG, which also owns Ireland's Aer Lingus and Spain's Iberia, said BA had received commitments for a five-year 
loan from a syndicate of banks.
The new loan has been facilitated by a state guarantee designed specifically to help UK businesses after Brexit, 
offered through UK Export Finance (UKEF).
Engine maker Rolls-Royce this year took advantage of the facility to raise liquidity of about £3bn with a guarantee 
from UKEF for 80 per cent of the loan.
IAG said BA's £2bn credit line would be drawn down in January, subject to settlement of terms.
However, BA will not be allowed to pay dividends to its parent for the term of the loan, which could put pressure on 
IAG's own capacity for dividend payments.
BA is IAG's biggest single contributor to group profit, the company confirmed.
IAG said it was continuing to explore other "debt initiatives" to improve liquidity, which stood at (EURO)8bn, 
excluding the UKEF guaranteed facility. BA would use the funding to prepare for a partial recovery in air travel as

governments begin to roll out vaccines. However, the carrier will also face competition from low-cost rivals such as 
Ryanair and Wizz Air, which are aiming to expand aggressively on short-haul routes across Europe as passengers 
return to the air.
Meanwhile, as the UK prepared to quit the EU's single market, IAG on Thursday announced board changes to 
ensure a majority of EU citizens sit as independent non-executive directors.
The changes follow moves this week by Ryanair and Wizz to strip voting rights from UK shareholders to comply 
with post-Brexit EU ownership rules.
Only airlines majority-owned and controlled by nationals of the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein 
will be allowed to fly between two EU destinations from January 1. However, both the UK and EU have said they 
would look at options to liberalise ownership rules within a year.
"It is disappointing that it has become necessary to make these changes to the board," said outgoing IAG chairman 
Antonio Vázquez. "However, we are pleased the EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement recognises the potential 
benefits of further liberalisation of airline ownership and control, because we believe it is in the best interests of the 
industry and consumers."

Ryanair and Wizz Air have removed the voting rights of UK shareholders as a result of Britain's exit from the EU. 
The airlines acted to comply with ownership rules.
Ryanair said it had to "take steps" to ensure it remained majority EU-owned and controlled to comply with European 
regulations. The airline said in a stock market announcement it would issue restricted shares to non-EU investors, 
specifying that holders were not entitled to speak or vote at any general meeting.
Wizz issued a similar announcement. The airline expects to serve about 60 per cent of its investor base with

China Central Longhao Airlines received a Boeing 737-800BCF on 31 December.
The aircraft, which is on an operating lease with GECAS, is the second freighter of the type to join Longhao's fleet.
The 2005-vintage 737-800 was acquired by GECAS in July 2020 and converted into a freighter at Boeing Shanghai.
Prior to that, the passenger aircraft was operated by Ryanair from 2005 to 2011, then by Anadolu Jet from 2012 to 
2019.
Longhao now has eight freighters in its fleet, comprising five 737-300Fs, one 737-400F and two 737-800BCFs.

Gol flies first as Ryanair backs Max
Boeing’s troubled 737 is operating again and has scored an important sales win – but it still has challenges to 
overcome
Brazilian airline Gol beat everyone to the punch when it resumed flights with the Boeing 737 Max on 9 December 
from Sao Paulo, one week after the country lifted the type’s grounding, and weeks ahead of much larger US 
carriers.
Gol was expecting its entire complement of seven Max to be cleared to fly by year-end. Its Max re-introduction was 
followed by Aeromexico on 21 December, which operated a domestic service from Mexico City to Cancun.
Gol’s move came after Brazil rescinded the type’s grounding on 25 November, several days after the US Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) lifted its prohibition, on 18 November.
The restart of revenue services with the narrowbody seems to mark a major turning point for both Boeing and the 
world’s 737 Max operators. Finally, the jet is back in the skies, flying passengers again after being grounded in 
March 2019 following two crashes that killed a combined 346 people.
Those events opened a chapter in Boeing’s history that it would likely prefer to forget, but from which it pledges to 
learn: a seemingly endless stream of bad news, allegations of corporate malfeasance and of browbeating the FAA, 
and public chastising before the US Congress.
Boeing has taken responsibility for its role in designing the flight-control software that, in failing, effectively triggered 
the incidents that doomed 737 Max 8s operated by Indonesia’s Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines.
The airframer and the FAA insist that all the Max’s safety concerns have been addressed; the Max has been made 
at least as safe as any commercial aircraft in the skies, they argue.
No Headline In Original
US carriers are lining up to get the Max airborne, with American Airlines leading the charge. American plans to 
resume Max operations on 29 December with a flight from Miami to New York LaGuardia.
Passenger concerns
Next up in the USA is United Airlines, which intends to operate its first post-grounding Max flights from Houston and 
Denver on 11 February. But in a sop to those passengers still wary of the Boeing narrowbody, United will also 
deploy other aircraft types on the initial routes for the Max, enabling customers to be shifted as required.
Southwest Airlines, meanwhile, says it intends to begin flights with the re-engined twinjet in March.
But given the concerns about the FAA’s certification processes that the Max episode has generated in regulators 
across the globe, it comes as little surprise that other jurisdictions are taking longer to re-approve the aircraft.
Canada on 18 December said it had “validated” Boeing’s changes to the Max and related pilot training updates. 
Although Transport Canada has not yet cleared the jet to fly, that seems likely in January, when the agency says it 
will issue the required airworthiness directive.
That order will include Canada-specific requirements. The agency says it will require that pilots be able to disable 
the jet’s stick-shaker when erroneously activated by an angle-of-attack sensor.
“This feature will help to reduce pilot workload, given what has been learned from the two tragic accidents, and has 
been fully evaluated by Transport Canada’s flight-test pilots,” the agency says. “There will also be differences in 
training, including training on the enhanced flight-deck procedure.”
Meanwhile, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency has indicated it will lift the Max’s grounding in mid-January.
But one wildcard remains: China. Analysts have little clarity on when that country, home to many 737 Max 
customers, might clear the jet. And they see the process as entangled with the US-China trade war and Beijing’s 
interest in promoting its homegrown competitor, the in-development Comac C919.
Chinese approval is critical for Boeing, as the nation’s carriers potentially account for some 30% of future Max 
deliveries, Air Lease executive chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy has said.
On 8 December, Boeing also kicked off the long process of delivering the roughly 450 737 Max that it has 
manufactured, then stockpiled, amid the grounding. The first example went to United.
The delivery process faces complications because of the pandemic, which has left many carriers unwilling or unable 
to take the new jets. But Boeing needs to get those aircraft out the door as the company badly needs the cash that 
comes from delivery.
Programme victory
Despite those difficulties, Boeing scored a victory for the programme just days after the FAA lifted the Max 
grounding.
On 3 December, Irish discount carrier Ryanair ordered 75 additional 737 Max, adding to the 135 it already had 
already committed to. That was followed on 22 December by Alaska Airlines, which ordered an additional 23 737-
9s, taking to 120 the carrier’s orders and options for the Max.
"We believe in this airplane, we believe in our strong partnership with Boeing, and we believe in the future of Alaska 
Airlines,” says group chief executive Brad Tilden, eyeing the post-pandemic market.
What became apparent with both orders, though, is that Boeing has no intention of dropping the Max name, despite 
some carriers removing that designation from their own communications.

Europe air transport
Spring of hope
Can low-cost carriers lead the region out of the crisis in the next few months? They have before – and might again
Lewis Harper London
There has been a marked shift in the European airline industry’s mood since a flurry of good news on the 
development of Covid-19 vaccines.
Previously, there were only tentative hopes that spring 2021 would bring a degree of relief from what will be a bleak 
winter for Europe’s operators.
But the possibility that vaccines might begin to have a genuine impact on controlling the pandemic in Europe by the 
end of the first quarter of 2021 has changed the narrative.
“There’s reasonable optimism now that summer 2021 will get back to some degree of normality,” the group chief 
executive of Ryanair, Michael O’Leary, said at an industry conference just after the first positive news on vaccine 
efficacy was announced. “We may not get back all the way to 2019, but in short haul I see no reason why we won’t 
go back to 75-80% of 2019.”
Wizz Air chief executive Jozsef Varadi said in mid-November that the low-cost carrier is aiming to be back at 100% 
capacity “within a few months”.
With international air travel forecast to be at around only 25% of 2019 levels globally during summer 2021 season, 
according to IATA, such figures would put both carriers well ahead of the crowd.
Indeed, the region’s network carriers, for example, are adjusting to life with smaller fleets, larger debts and, in some 
cases, cautious government shareholders, who may need to be tapped for more support in 2021.
No Headline In Original
Crucially, network carriers are also looking to 2021 with very little prospect of a significant boom in ­long­haul travel.
In Europe’s short-haul markets the outlook is very different – not least because it is likely to offer a straightforward 
way for frustrated leisure passengers to scratch the air-travel itch. The mini-revival in such traffic during the July-
August window provided a glimpse of that pent-up demand.
This likely trend was described by IATA chief economist Brian Pearce ahead of the association’s November AGM: 
“Undoubtedly in this initial [recovery] environment, with price-sensitive leisure travellers and those opportunities for 
carriers with very low costs that can fly cash-positive flights at a smaller load, will clearly favour the ultra-low-cost 
airlines and a number [are already] stepping in.”
Ryanair and Wizz certainly appear to have the right ingredients in that regard. Both have emphasised the 
importance of keeping aircraft in the air during the crisis, rather than focusing on retirements and storage, thereby 
maintaining the flexibility to add capacity quickly when demand allows.
That flexibility is boosted in Ryanair’s case by union agreements that have seen it avoid mass layoffs. Conversely, 
Wizz did make some job cuts early on in the crisis, but its record of not recognising unions means – rightly or 
wrongly – it can flex its workforce at short notice.
Furthermore, their lack of national affiliation in Europe’s liberalised aviation market means both airlines are able to 
shift capacity around as demand dictates – demonstrated by Wizz opening a string of bases in the region in mid-
2020 as most carriers were retrenching.
In some cases, that positions them to move into markets vacated by rivals. “Some of our competitors are 
contracting in a big way and leaving a market vacuum behind them – of course, we make sure that we take 
advantage of that,” Varadi said in October.
But it is also important to note that taking advantage of pent-up demand in 2021 will not be an issue of business 
model alone.
In the European low-cost sphere, Norwegian is teetering on the edge of the abyss, having entered an Irish process 
in mid-November that gives it financial protection while it attempts to restructure.
EasyJet has been much quieter than Ryanair and Wizz on its expectations for 2021, while taking a more cautious 
approach to adding back capacity.
At the same time, success might be measured on different terms for the network carriers. A race to secure the first 
ticket sales during the recovery is really just a sprint during the marathon recovery ahead.
In terms of short-term prospects, however, the market dichotomy was perhaps best summarised by Ryanair 
mainline chief executive Eddie Wilson: “If you’ve got the money, you’ve got the aircraft, you’ve got the people, 
you’ve got the space at the airports, then you are in a much better position than those [airlines] that are scrambling 
around, that are running out of cash, have to raise their money, looking for short-term deals all the time, selling their 
aircraft, firing their people.” ◗

Dec 31, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
American Airlines AAL[1] restarted commercial flight services using Boeing's 737 MAX jets. With this, the company 
became the first U.S.-based carrier to resume operations through the 737 MAX jets, ever since the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) gave its green signal in November to the aircraft for taking to the skies. Notably, the jets, 
manufactured by The Boeing Company BA[2], remained grounded since March 2019 after being involved in two 
deadly accidents in different parts of the world within a span of few months.Meanwhile, European low-cost carrier 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] reportedly [4]chose to strip its UK shareholders of their voting rights, once Britain 
leaves the EU tomorrow, in a bid to comply with the EU rules on airline ownership. Hungary-based Wizz Air also 
took similar action.Alaska Air Group's ALK[5] subsidiary Alaska Airlines was also in news, courtesy of its decision to 
ban emotional support animals on its flights, shortly.The move followed theU.S. Department of Transportation's 
order to tighten the rule pertaining to passengers travelling with service animals on flights Recap of the Past Week's 
Most Important Stories 1 American Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), operated its first 737 Max 
flight on the Miami-New York route on Dec 29. Maintaining its pro-customer stance, the carrier is providing flexibility 
to customers for switch flights in case they are skeptical of flying on the Boeing 737 Max. 
The Boeing 737 MAX aircraft is sought after in the airline space, mainly because of its fuel efficiency. Other U.S. 
airlines which have these jets in their fleet are United Airlines UAL[6] and Southwest Airlines LUV[7]. United Airlines 
plans to start flying the MAX aircraft on Feb 11, 2021[8]. Southwest Airlines expects to resume commercial flight 
services in March 2021 using the planes, per the previous week's write up[9].You can seethe complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[10]2. From Jan 11, Alaska Airlines will only allow service dogs to 
accompany passengers on its flights. However, for tickets booked prior to that date for travel on or before Feb 28, 
2021, the airline will continue with its usual policy of transporting emotional support animals. The complete ban on 
emotional support animals will be effective after Feb 28.[11]3. Per a FOX Business report[12], Southwest Airlines' 
CEO Gary Kelly stated that the pay cuts or furloughs are no longer anticipated at the Dallas-based carrier in 2021 
following the outgoing President Donald Trump's decision to sign the $900 worth relief package bill. With the 
president's stamp of approval, the bill became a law. The new package includes a $15-billion grant to the U.S. 
airlines. With this fresh payroll aid, United Airlines and American Airlines are also contemplating calling back their 
laid-off employees.4. Despite the rise in coronavirus cases in the United States, the final weekend of 2020 (Dec 26

and Dec 27) was a busy one for the U.S. airlines. This can be gauged from theTransportation Security 
Administration[13](TSA) data. The TSA reported that 1,128,773 and 1,284,589 passengers passed through the TSA 
checkpoints on Dec 26 and Dec 27, respectively. Notably, this has been the busiest weekend in the past nine 
months. Performance The following table shows the price movement of key airline players over the past week and

The more abruptly the UK splits from the EU, the greater the disruption to business. Investment provides one 
example. In their first stock exchange announcements since an EU/UK trade deal was struck, Ryanair and Wizz Air 
said they planned to strip non-EU shareholders - notably British ones - of some or all votes from January 1. Even 
worse for Ryanair investors, they will now be prohibited from buying stock in the Irish low-cost carrier, or selling 
their shares to compatriots.
EasyJet and British Airways' owner IAG have plans for similar restrictions. Airlines are scrambling to avoid 
classification as majority-owned by non-EU investors. These businesses typically cannot operate services within the 
EU. Hefty UK investor bases - more than one-third of the total for Wizz Air - become a liability from Friday. IAG's 
difficulty is exacerbated by a 25 per cent Qatari stake.
Webs of co-operation are tearing like spider silk. Airlines see a hard Brexit, despite the EU/UK trade deal. The 
treaty is explicit that UK carriers can count on no transitional rights to ferry passengers within the EU. In 2019, IAG 
carried 62m passengers between EU countries, more than half the total, albeit that the UK still belonged to the 
trade bloc.
British financial services business will be similarly keen to stay on the right side of Brussels. They will lose 
"passports" to operate within the EU on Friday. Transitional arrangements are skimpy and one-sided.
Ridiculously, UK and EU investors could end up trading some securities in the US, whose markets have regulatory 
equivalence with EU peers.
Brexit/airline shares: no frills and no votes Twitter : @FTLex
Such awkward workarounds are already illustrated by the airlines. Wizz Air expects to disenfranchise about 60 per 
cent of shares held by non-EU investors. That should bring their voting control down to around onethird of the total, 
worth £1.3bn. Ryanair has taken a characteristically blunter stance in planning to strip non-EU shareholders of all 
voting rights.
Shares in Ryanair and Wizz rose with other London-listed stocks yesterday morning. Lost voting rights represent no 
more than a small incremental cost for a subset of investors. This counts for little compared with stronger sterling 
and a legally robust means for airlines to keep EU air traffic rights. What will matter more for UK business is the 
totality of such costs. This can only rise.

Ryanair and Wizz Air are to take away the voting rights of UK shareholders as a result of Britain's exit from the EU.
The airlines are acting to comply with EU ownership rules once Britain leaves the bloc on Friday.
Ryanair said yesterday that it had to "take steps" to ensure it would remain majority EU-owned and controlled to 
comply with European regulations.
The Irish airline said in a stock market announcement that it would issue restricted shares to non-EU investors, 
specifying that holders were not entitled to speak or vote at any general meeting.
Wizz issued a similar stock market announcement. The Hungarian airline expects to serve about 60 per cent of its 
investor base with restricted share notices. Without the action, the airline would have been 80 per cent owned by 
non-EU nationals from January 1. Both airlines are enacting long-held plans to ensure they maintain their flying 
rights after Brexit.
EU regulations demand that airlines with EU operating licences, including BA owner IAG and easyJet, are majority 
owned and controlled by nationals of the bloc, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein. This enables airlines 
to fly between EU destinations.
From January 1, UK nationals will be treated as non-EU and their shares will no longer count towards that 
ownership requirement. While potentially problematic for UK shareholders, the arrangement will not present 
Ryanair and Wizz to erase UK investors' voting rights
immediate operational issues, analysts www.say.UK investors that may be affected include Baillie Gifford, second-
biggest investor in Ryanair, and Wizz top-20 investors Jupiter, Legal & General Investment Management and 
Schroders, according to Refinitiv's latest filings. The EU and the UK will look at "options for reciprocal liberalisation" 
of the rules within the next year. Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, said airlines with large UK ownership 
would either need to wait for a favourable agreement on airline ownership rights or design alternative ownership 
and holding structures to "safeguard EU nationality of individual airlines".
UK-based easyJet said last week it would suspend voting rights of some investors if necessary to raise its EU 
voting base above 50 per cent.

comply with European regulations.
The Irish airline said in a stock market announcement that it would issue restricted shares to non-EU investors, 
specifying that holders were not entitled to speak or vote at any general meeting.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, told the Financial Times earlier in December that the airline's EU 
ownership would fall to about 40 per cent, from about 55 per cent, when UK shareholders were excluded.
Wizz issued a similar stock market announcement. The Hungarian airline expects to serve about 60 per cent of its 
investor base with restricted share notices. Without the action, the airline would have been 80 per cent owned by 
non-EU nationals from January 1. Both airlines are enacting long-held plans to ensure they maintain their flying

owned and controlled by nationals of the bloc, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein. This enables airlines 
to fly between EU destinations.
Ryanair and Wizz UK investors to lose voting rights after Britain leaves EU
From January 1, UK nationals will be treated as non-EU and their shares will no longer count towards that 
ownership requirement. Institutional investors that might be affected by the moves include Baillie Gifford, the 
second-biggest investor in Ryanair, and Wizz top-20 investors Jupiter, Legal & General Investment Management 
and Schroders. Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, said airlines with large UK ownership would either need to 
wait for a favourable agreement on ownership rights or design alternative ownership and holding structures to 
"safeguard EU nationality of individual airlines".
IAG, the owner of airlines including BA, Iberia and Aer Lingus, faces the most complex problems on ownership after 
Brexit. The group has never disclosed how many of its shareholders are EU nationals when the UK is excluded.
UK-based easyJet said last week it would suspend voting rights of some investors if necessary to raise its EU 
voting base above 50 per cent.

Ryanair on Tuesday confirmed it would restrict the voting rights of British shareholders from Jan. 1 in a bid to 
ensure it remains majority EU-owned and retain full licensing and flight rights in the bloc.
The plan to restrict British shareholders was approved by the airline last year, subject to the terms of a final 
agreement on Britain's post-Brexit relationship with the European Union, which was agreed last week.
"Restricted Share Notices will be issued to the registered holder(s) of each Restricted Share in due course, 
specifying that the holder(s) of such shares shall not be entitled to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of 
the Company," Ryanair said in a statement.
"These resolutions will remain in place until the Board of the Company determines that the ownership and control of 
the Company is no longer such that there is any risk to the airline licences held by the Company's subsidiaries," the 
statement said.
UK nationals, like all other non-EU nationals, will not be permitted to acquire ordinary shares, the statement said.
Ryanair last February said that while the airline was 55% EU-owned, Britain-based shareholders at the time 
controlled around 20% of its stock.
Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan said at the time he expected half of those to re-domicile to the EU if Britain 
chose to make a sharp break with the EU. (Reuters)

POINTSAmerican Airlines reintroduced the 737 MAX on TuesdayThe flight comes amid a lull in travelConsumers 
may be reluctant to fly because of the pandemic American Airlines flight 718 left Miami late Tuesday morning, 
marking the airliner's reintroduction of the Boeing 737. The return comes amid a pronounced lull in air travel, 
however, raising questions about the need to maintain a fleet of mega-jets.According to the Reuters news service, 
American Airlines counts 31 of the 737 MAX jet in its fleet. The jumbo jet was grounded in March 2019 after two 
crashes over five months left 346 people dead, but returned to U.S. service Tuesday with the flight[1] from Miami to 
New York.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration cleared the aircraft for flight again in November after Boeing 
made several improvements on software and training protocols.'This aircraft is ready to go,' American Airlines' 
President Robert Isom was quoted[2] by Reuters as saying Tuesday.U.S. air travel has increased during the holiday 
season. The Transportation Security Administration reported 1.1 million people moved through its checkpoints on 
Monday[3], though that level is indicative ofpeople traveling due to the holiday season. 
With the ongoing pandemic though, the amount of through traffic in airportsin November was as low as 575,000.Air 
travel could be further supported by vaccine distribution given American's presence in the U.S. supply chain. The 
airliner transported its first batch[4] of vaccines for COVID-19 on Dec. 14, though that does little to support 
passenger levels.Boeing, for its part, could be facing a multi-billion-dollar problem with the 737. The company in 
December reported new orders from Alaskan Airlines and Ireland's low-cost airline Ryanair, though Boeing doesn't 
get paid until those are delivered. In November, analysis from CNN found Boeing was out some $20.7 billion from 
the grounding[5] of the jumbo jet. Demand, despite the holiday bump, remains suppressed as well. Over the four-
week period ending Dec. 18, the U.S. Energy Department reported jet fuel demand[6] was down by about 33% 
year-on-year.For American Airlines, that lull in demand showed up as a 73% year-on-year drop in revenue during 
the third quarter[7]. A pre-holiday survey[8] from the Pew Research Center, meanwhile, found more than half of the 
respondents said the pandemic would alter how, or if, they traveled at all.The rise of video conference calls during 
the pandemic, meanwhile, may diminish the need for corporate travel in a post-pandemic world. On attitudes in 
general, Lucy Rattrie, a business psychologist, told British travel management company Gray Dawes Travel that 
mindsets have changed[9]. On one hand, people will certainly look to break cabin fever with increased 
vacationing.'Yet, at the same time, people will likely be apprehensive and concerned, traveling with a lot more self-
care, looking after themselves physically, emotionally, spiritually and mentally,' she said.Commenting on the legacy 
of the Boeing 737 itself, aviation historian Graham Simons said the latest iteration was likely a mistake'They should 
have never come out with it in the first place,' he told CNN[10]. American Airlines will fly the first 737 MAX

Airlines are facing their worst crisis in a generation. Michael O'Leary is in no mood to waste it.
As rivals have collapsed and retreated, the Ryanair chief executive is on the hunt for opportunities to increase the 
Irish airline's dominance of European airspace.
"I have never in my 30 years in the industry seen such a clean-out," Mr O'Leary said. "The real seismic change from 
Covid will be the growth opportunities across Europe. They are much greater than after the financial crisis or 9/11."
Airline capacity has been gutted, creating a window for survivors to fill the gaps once people start flying again. 
Thomas Cook and Flybe have collapsed, while Norwegian - until recently a big operator in the European market - 
has entered administration.
Mr O'Leary projected that 100m of his competitors' seats would be taken out over the next 18 months, about a 15 
per cent reduction on normal passenger traffic.
"Somebody has to step up and take that capacity," he said.
Ryanair set to gain altitude after rivals' rapid descent Airlines. Rebound projections Boss O'Leary expects 100m 
of competitors' seats to be taken out over the ....
He is in discussions with airports in Italy and Spain, which had been Norwegian customers, about filling those slots 
with Ryanair planes.
Mr O'Leary has cultivated a reputation for outlandish claims as he has overseen more than two decades of near-
continuous growth at Ryanair, based on slashing costs and maximising efficiencies to undercut rivals and take their 
passengers.
But low-cost carriers are expected to lead the recovery in flying because the short-haul and leisure markets they 
serve will rebound faster than intercontinental and business travel.
Traditional flag carriers, such as British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa, rely on short-haul networks to feed 
passengers into their hubs and on to longhaul flights.
"The shape of the demand recovery favours airlines exposed to short-haul leisure traffic," said Daniel Roeska, 
aviation analyst at Bernstein.
Or, as Mr O'Leary put it, "everyone who has been trapped and gone on holiday to Bognor Regis will want to go to 
Portugal, Italy and Greece".
An executive who has historically used industry downturns to cut his own costs is driving a hard bargain.
"The question is, which airports are most commercial about regrowing their traffic quickly in summer 2021?" he 
said.
Stansted was "all over us" when UK rival easyJet announced it would close its base there, he said. Ryanair 
hoovered up more than 300 of easyJet's weekly slots at the airport for next summer.
Still, the initial impact of the pandemic on Ryanair has been bruising. It expects to carry 38m passengers this year, 
a fifth of 2019's number, and suffered a net loss of (EURO)197m for the six months to September.
Losses in the second half of its financial year are expected to be greater, especially after the fresh wave of flight 
cancellations this week, as countries closed their borders to the UK over concerns of a new strain of the virus.
The latest uncertainty came as a blow to an industry hopeful that an uptick in travel over Christmas could offer 
some much-needed cash during the lean winter months.
Despite this, Andrew Lobbenberg, head of airlines research at HSBC, agreed that there was an opportunity for 
Ryanair to grow as flag carriers lost out on long-haul flights and weaker rivals disappeared.
The Irish carrier has also signalled its ambition by confirming a discounted order for Boeing's 737 Max aircraft, 
which will cut its costs further when it begins taking deliveries from early next year.
But Mr Lobbenberg cautioned that any expansion was not "going to be immediate. Everything is gradual, and 
increasingly it is hard to anticipate the pace of it".
While easyJet is regarded as having taken a more conservative approach to the crisis, Hungarian low-cost carrier 
Wizz Air has promised to take on Ryanair as it expands out of its eastern European heartlands to become a 
regional participant.
Dirk-Maarten Molenaar, a partner at Boston Consulting Group, said legacy carriers were also becoming more 
flexible, and the "last thing" companies such as BA wanted to do was to make significant cuts to the short-haul 
networks they needed to feed into their hubs.
Despite the pressures, Ryanair's share price is higher than it was a year ago and has risen by about a quarter since 
the start of November, as investors have been encouraged that the rollout of Covid vaccines will fuel a recovery.
Ryanair set to gain altitude after rivals' rapid descent Airlines. Rebound projections Boss O'Leary expects 100m 
of competitors' seats to be taken out over the ....
Mr O'Leary said that there had been a "noticeable but single-digit" uplift in bookings over the past month, but from a 
"very, very low base".
He conceded that his plans were dependent on the swift rollout of vaccines by the governments he regularly 
savages for incompetence and inefficiency.
He said of the UK government: "They will mess about, but ultimately they will throw so much money at the vaccine 
they will get there."
Ryanair has a "working assumption" that it will fly between 90m and 130m passengers in the year to March 2022, a 
wide spread based on how quickly the demand for travel returns.
It is well below 2019's nearly 150m passengers, a number the chief executive did not see returning until at least 
2023.
Mr O'Leary said: "We have consistently been planning for a reasonably quick recovery and constantly disappointed. 
What has changed is the vaccines are arriving.
"The issue for our industry is, is that recovery in May or August? We just don't know."
'I have never in the industry seen such a clean-out … Somebody has to step up and take that capacity'
38m Estimated 2020 passengers for Ryanair, a fifth of last year's figure (EURO)197m Net loss at the carrier for the 
six months to September

 Ryanair (RYA.L) said Tuesday it will restrict all non-European Union voting rights in the company following the 
Brexit deadline of Jan. 1, 2021, to protect its EU air licenses. 
The move will ensure that the company remains majority EU-owned and -controlled following Brexit. 
Meanwhile, UK nationals will not be permitted to acquire Ryanair shares and will not be required to sell any shares 
they owned in the company before the beginning of 2021. These shareholders will lose the right to attend, speak or 
vote at any general meeting of the company, according to a filing. 
Ryanair shares gained almost 1% on Tuesday morning.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has said that reopening its base at Shannon in 2021 will provide an opportunity for it to 
rebuild its presence in Ireland's Mid-West Region. It plans to position a single aircraft there from April. The carrier 
will operate 32 weekly frequencies to 14 destinations in Portugal, Spain, the UK, Lithuania, and Poland, Ryanair 
Designated Activity Company (DAC) chief executive Eddie Wilson outlined at a press conference at what the Irish 
Times described as a largely deserted Shannon Airport. 
Mary Considine, chief executive of airport operator Shannon Group, described the move as "an early Christmas 
present" and "a very positive end to what has been an extremely tough year." Wilson said that the deal it had struck 
with the airport meant it would target 450,000 passengers at Shannon next year. He listed Faro, Lanzarote, Malaga, 
Palma de Mallorca, Manchester Int'l, London, Kaunas, Warsaw Modlin, and Wroclaw as potential destinations. 
Ryanair based two aircraft there in 2019, but in October 2020, at the end of the Summer 2020 season, it suspended 
operations at four of the five airports in its Irish home market, namely Shannon, Cork, Kerry, and Knock. "The 
airport has worked tirelessly with Ryanair over the last number of months to secure capacity ahead of next summer, 
and we're delighted that this reopening of the Ryanair base will restore Shannon's connectivity and support the 
economic recovery of the Mid-West next year," Wilson said. He added, however, that "without recovery incentives, 
passenger capacity at Dublin Int'l will fall, and Cork as a Ryanair base may not reopen for summer 2021." He called 
on Ireland's transport minister, Eamon Ryan, to urgently allow incentives on airport charges. "There will be 
significantly reduced capacity in Europe next summer, and unless the Irish government secures that connectivity 
now, unfortunately, it will go elsewhere in Europe where governments, regions, and airports are actively engaged in 
securing this vital infrastructure, along with the much-needed employment it will generate." State-run Cork and 
Dublin airport operator DAA, previously the Dublin Airport Authority, promised earlier in December to give airlines 
discounts on its charges as long as they were linked to performance on passenger numbers.

Dec 25, 2020( Gates of Vienna: http://gatesofvienna.net/ Delivered by Newstex)  A large number of maskless 
demonstrators gathered in a veterans' memorial park in the Bay Area of California to sing Christmas carols and 
protest Governor Gavin Newsom's strict COVID lockdown orders. Meanwhile, German police reported 297 
incidents of politically-motivated crime connected with the Wuhan Coronavirus. In other news, police in the Bosnian 
town of Bihac blame the residents of an asylum center for setting a fire that destroyed the facility and displaced 
1,200 migrants. To see the headlines and the articles, click 'Continue reading' below.

Week[46] New weekly jobless claims fell by 89,000 to 803,000 in the week that ended December 19, the 
Department of Labor said Wednesday. The prior week's initial claims number was revised up to 892,000 from the 
initial estimate of 885,000. Economists had forecast a decline in claims to 875,000, according to Econoday. Jobless 
claims can be volatile week to week so many economists prefer to look at the four-week average. This rose to 
818,250, an increase of 4,000 from the previous week's upwardly revised level. Jobless claims which are a proxy 
for layoffs remain at extremely high levels. Prior to the pandemic, the highest level of claims was 695,000 hit in 
October of 1982. In March of 2009, at the depths of the financial crisis recession, jobless claims peaked at 
665,000.[47]  'Jab &#38; Go!' Airline Pushes Vaccine Gimmick to Promote Summer Flights[48] Budget airline 
Ryanair is promoting the sale of summer flights with a 'Jab &#38; Go!' advertising gimmick despite having 
previously stated that it wouldn't require passengers to take a COVID vaccine before they fly. Ryanair's website 
features a banner with the words 'BOOK SUMMER   VACCINES ARE COMING' alongside a generic image of a 
needle next to the words 'Jab &#38; Go!' The ad looks like it is promoting some kind of package deal where people 
can arrange their vaccination at the same time they book their flight, but the whole thing is just a gimmick   
Ryanair's isn't in the business of arranging vaccinations.[49]  A Judge in Virginia Ruled That a Black Defendant 
Gates of Vienna News Feed 12/24/2020
Wouldnt Have a Fair Trial Unless Portraits of White Judges Were Removed From the Courtroom[50] This is so 
dumb. A judge in Virginia ruled that a black defendant wouldn't have a fair trial unless all portraits of white judges 
are removed from the courtroom. Everything is racist. Apparently, even the mere presence of portraits of judges in a 
courtroom can lead to 'inequity.' At least that's the conclusion of Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge David Bernhard 
who, according to The Seattle Times, wrote in an opinion that the presence of portraits of former judges in the 
Fairfax Circuit Court could create bias judges and juries. Why? Because everyone is a racist, of course! And he is 
refusing to allow the portraits to be displayed during any trial he presides over.[51]  Biden CIA Appointee Worked 
With CCP Propaganda Org Conducting 'Undercover Intel Ops', Appears on China State Media[52] Michael 
O'Hanlon   an appointee to the Central Intelligence Agency External Advisory Board under the Obama-Biden 
administration   visited a Chinese Communist Party-run think tank identified by the U.S. government as conducting 
'undercover intelligence gathering' operations and seeking to coerce foreign actors into backing the Chinese 
Communist Party's 'preferred policies.' Also the Director of the Brooking Institute's Foreign Policy Research Team 
and adjunct professor at Georgetown and Columbia Universities, O'Hanlon visited the China Association for 
International Friendly Contact (CAIFC) on August 23rd, 2012   the same year his Central Intelligence Agency's 
(CIA) External Advisory Board stint ended.[53]  CNN: Amend Constitution to Prevent Trump or Anyone Like Him 
Having Power Again[54] CNN's Chris 'Fredo' Cuomo and guest Anthony Scaramucci suggested Wednesday that 
the US Constitution should be amended to ensure Donald Trump (or anyone else like him) can never become 
President and wield the power of the executive again. Assuming that Biden will be sworn in as the next President, 
Cuomo shit-chatted his way through an interview with former Trump insider turned hater Scaramucci. 'We're gonna 
need something to check his power or to check a president like him, god forbid we get another disaster like this,' 
Scaramucci declared at one point in the conversation.[55]  DC Mayor Muriel Bowser Proclaims Christmas Eve as 
'Dr. Anthony S. Fauci Day' In Washington DC[56] Far left DC Mayor Muriel Bowser proclaimed Thursday, 
December 24, 2020 (Christmas Eve) as 'Dr. Anthony S. Fauci Day' in Washington DC. President Trump earlier this 
month signed an executive order and officially made Christmas Eve a federal holiday so people could enjoy more 
time with their families and celebrate the birth of Christ.[57]  Democrats, Several Republicans, China and Other 
Foreign Entities Are Planning to Run Out the Clock to Steal the Election   We Won't Let Them[58] President Trump 
won the 2020 election with more votes than any candidate ever. He crushed the old record set by Barack Obama in 
2008 of 69 million votes. President Trump became the first candidate in US history to surpass 70 million votes. His 
rallies and unscripted boat parades, car parades and more indicated a big win, but his win was extraordinary. Of 
course, the President's opponent was very weak. This is why it is totally ridiculous unreasonable nonsense to even 
suggest that senile and basement dwelling Joe Biden overcame this record and won the 2020 election. This was a 
steal. It was the biggest criminal steal in world history and it must not be allowed.[59]  Destination: Socialism[60] 
Evolutionary socialism is the type of socialist movement that has become most prevalent in the United States. This 
means that its signs must be sought in policies regarding compulsory wealth redistribution. As a proxy for wealth 
redistribution, we can consider the indicator of welfare spending. What is the position of the GOP on the issue of 
wealth redistribution? The GOP platform does not explicitly address it. Instead, there are vague statements about 
simplifying the tax code and boosting economic growth, along with promises not to divide the American people into 
winners and losers. This silence is alarming because the Republicans either don't understand the implications of 
compulsory wealth redistribution or tacitly agree with the Democrats' agenda.[61]  Effort to Recall California 
Governor Newsom Reaches 870,000 Signatures[62] Mike Netter, an organizer of the RecallGavin2020.com recall 
petition, says the campaign has now reached 870,000 signatures. They need a total of 1,500,000 signatures to 
trigger a recall election of Gavin Newsom. The deadline is March 10, 2021.[63]  Journalist Among Group Charged 
Over BLM-Inspired Firebombing Attacks in Arkansas[64] Four suspects, including a journalist, from Little Rock, Ark. 
with extreme far-left ties were taken into custody and charged by federal authorities last week in connection to 
coordinated firebombings of police cruisers over the summer. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of 
Arkansas announced that Brittany Dawn Jeffrey, 31, Renea Baek Goddard, 22, Aline Espinosa-Villegas, 24, and 
Emily Nowlin, 27, were arrested following a months-long ATF investigation.[65]  Kirk Cameron Hosts Second 
Maskless Christmas Caroling Protest Against California Lockdowns[66] Christian apologist and former child actor 
Kirk Cameron hosted a second Christmas caroling protest of Gov. Gavin Newsom's lockdown orders in California. 
The 'Growing Pains' star hosted about 100 supporters who sang maskless outside The Oaks shopping mall in 
Thousand Oaks, California. The event was not sanctioned by The Oaks mall, which issued a statement 
condemning the gathering.[67]  NYC Residents Can't Get Gun Permits Due to George Floyd Protests: Source[68] 
The NYPD hasn't processed thousands of applications for gun permits partly because cops tasked with the job 
Gates of Vienna News Feed 12/24/2020
were reassigned amid the protests, riots and looting that helped spur the deluge, The Post has learned. Meanwhile, 
a leading gun-rights group on Thursday called the inaction by the department's License Division 'very suspicious.' 
The Post exclusively revealed Wednesday that while 8,088 applications for gun permits had been filed since March 
22   when COVID-19 restrictions went into effect   only 1,087 were granted, a rate of around 14 percent. During the 
same time period last year, the NYPD approved 1,778 of 2,562 applications, a rate of nearly 70 percent.[69]  Pence 
Plans to Oversee January 6 Electoral College Vote, Then Leave America for Israel[70] Is Pence planning on 
avoiding any fallout? Vice President Mike Pence plans to oversee the Electoral College vote on January 6th, and 
then leave the country for a trip to Israel, Bahrain, and Poland. Politico reported last week that Vice President 
Pence is tentatively planning a trip to the countries of Israel, Bahrain, and Poland, and will be leaving the country 
directly after he takes charge of counting the Electoral College votes in Congress on January 6th. One Pence ally 
told Politico that the timing of the trip is 'anything but coincidental.' 'On the surface, the trip is part of a push to 
underscore the Trump administration's role in brokering a series of diplomatic agreements to normalize relations 
between Israel and a handful of Arab countries, including Bahrain,' Politico notes. '[But the Israel trip also] allows 
Pence to put distance between himself and Trump's complaints about the election outcome that are likely to 
intensify after Congress affirms Biden's win.' [Comment: Sounds like is Pence going to betray Trump.][71]  Robert 
Kennedy Jr. Again Warns of the Authoritarian Surveillance State and Coup to Overcome World Democracies[72] 
Robert Kennedy, Jr. sees what many of Americans see. The Big Corporations and Elites want to take over the 
world and our individual freedoms. Robert Kennedy, Jr., son of the former Attorney General for his brother John F. 
Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy Sr, has warned about Big Pharma and Big Tech joining forces before. He's warned about 
Bill Gates' bio security agenda, the rise of the authoritarian surveillance state and the Big Pharma sponsored coup 
d'etat against liberal democracy in a protest in Germany this past August. Robert Kennedy Jr. warns again of the 
Big Pharma, Big Tech, Big Media agenda that will enslave the human race if brought to fruition.[73]  Rudy Giuliani: 
Voting Machines Were 'Programmed to Give Biden Somewhere Between 2% and 5% Advantage' (Audio)[74] 
Trump Attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani joined Bernie and Sid on WABC to update the 
audience on the election lawsuits. Rudy told the WABC audience, 'We believe from what we saw in Michigan that 
the machines have an inaccurate vote that they're programmed to give Biden somewhere between a 2% and 5% 
advantage.'[75]  Sidney Powell Says White House Officials Have Blocked Her From Speaking to President 
Trump[76] She says the president's 'own people are misleading and undermining him' Attorney Sidney Powell says 
White House officials have barred her from speaking to President Donald Trump, claiming the president's 'own 
people are misleading and undermining him.' What are the details? Powell told The Washington Examiner that her 
access to Trump has been cut off since Friday, when the president reportedly floated the idea of appointing her to 
serve as a special counsel to investigate voter fraud   which was an idea shot down by some of his advisers. 'I 
haven't met or spoken with the President since Friday night,' Powell told the Examiner. 'The President knows this 
election was stolen but he is not getting the support he, the Constitution, and the Republic deserve. His own people 
are misleading and undermining him while protecting their own careers and agendas.'[77]  The Devil is in the 
Procedures[78] This has been a well-planned and carefully played game of procedure to run the clock out on the 
presidential election There is only one way for the President of the United States to step outside of the procedural 
game, and that is calling on his military which still supports him to help run a new election that is free from the 
corruption that was rampantly displayed in the November 3 election. The process is still unfolding. Congress will 
count the votes on January 6, 2021, and Congress has the ability to void, or nullify the votes that have been 
certified fraudulently. I still hope for this remedy to our current situation. Although I am doubtful of it happening. 
Since many of our representatives and senators are also professional players on the CCP team. They will be 
playing their procedural game trying to run down the clock the whole time. Americans need to know what is going 
on. We won't be informed by the news media. Since they are also on the side of the CCP. Our only hope in getting 
the word out on what really happens is by each one of us telling others what is going on, and what to expect on the 
6th of January. If there is a declaration of some sort that nullifies the previous election and calls for a supervised, 
controlled and fair election to replace it. We need to support that as a people. It may be extra procedural, but all of 
the procedures have been purchased, and sold to one buyer. There is no other way for a fair election to determine 
who will be the President of the United States for the next four years.[79]  The Gauntlet is Thrown Down. 
Oathkeepers to President: 'Invoke the Insurrection Act or We Will Fight a[80] Bloody and Desperate Revolution to 
Throw-off Biden/Chi-Com Puppet Regime' The Oathkeepers have laid out the situation within the United States 
succinctly, and clearly the Gauntlet has been thrown down. From the Oathkeepeers web site: 'The time is now near 
at hand which must probably determine whether Americans are to be freemen or slaves; whether they are to have 
Gates of Vienna News Feed 12/24/2020
any property they can call their own; whether their houses and farms are to be pillaged and destroyed, and 
themselves consigned to a state of wretchedness from which no human efforts will deliver them. The fate of unborn 
millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and conduct of this army. Our cruel and unrelenting enemy 
leaves us only the choice of brave resistance, or the most abject submission. We have, therefore, to resolve to 
conquer or die.'   General George Washington, Address to the Continental Army Before the Battle of Long Island, 
August 27, 1776 President Trump, We now face a moment of peril as great, or greater, as what General 
Washington and his men faced in 1776. The very survival of our nation as a free Constitutional Republic hangs in 
the balance. We have but one last chance to save it. The fate of unborn millions will now depend on your conduct, 
the conduct of the current members of our armed forces, and the conduct of we the many millions of American 
veterans and patriots who are still loyal to our Constitution. When you were sworn in, you took the following oath, as 
mandated by Article II of the Constitution: 'I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of 
President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the 
United States.' It's time to honor that oath by defending the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. 
This is your moment of destiny. Will you take your place in history as the savior of our Republic, right up there with 
President Washington and Lincoln? Or will you fail to act, while you still can, and leave office on January 20, 2021, 
leaving We the People to fight a desperate revolution/civil war against an illegitimate usurper and his Chicom 
puppet regime? Here are the facts: [Comment: Recommended reading.][81]  Trump Pardons Another 26, Including 
Paul Manafort, Charles Kushner, And Roger Stone[82] A second wave of presidential pardons from President 
Trump came on Wednesday night. The president issued 26 different pardons, most notably to his 2016 campaign 
manager Paul Manafort, Republican political operative Roger Stone, and Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-
law Jared Kushner.[83]  'Unconstitutional and Illegal': Dozens of Maskless Bay Area Christmas Carolers Protest 
Health Order[84] A group of Christmas carolers in Napa decided to go rogue on Wednesday evening, using the 
holiday tradition as a form of protest against California's current stay-at-home order. KTVU reports dozens of 
maskless North Bay residents gathered in front of the illuminated tree at Veterans Memorial Park to sing 'Silent 
Night' and other festive songs as they passed out flyers urging the recall of Gov. Gavin Newsom.[85]  Watch: We 
Support Karl Marx Not Biden, Say Armed Michigan Protesters[86] An armed group of protesters carrying Antifa and 
Black Lives Matter gear denied supporting President-Elect Joe Biden. Instead, the Lansing, Michigan, protesters 
said they support Karl Marx. Video tweeted by independent journalist Brendan Gutenschwager shows a group of 
protesters, some of whom were armed with rifles, facing off against Trump supporters who gathered for a Christmas 
celebration. When asked why they support Joe Biden, one responded 'I don't support Joe Biden.'[87]  Website 
Invites Parents to Track 'Woke' Curriculum in Schools[88] A new website is tracking woke curriculum and liberal 
indoctrination in schools and invites parents to submit examples from their children's schools. The website, titled 
'What Are They Learning?,' describes itself as a 'crowd-sourced site created by Luke Rosiak, an investigative 
journalist and data analyst in the Washington, D.C. area who has written about the impact of 'Equity' on schools 
across the country.'[89]  'When the Gretch Stole Christmas': Trump Supporters at Michigan State Capitol Protest 
Gov. Whitmer's Lockdown[90] In defiance of Demmocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's statewide lockdown, a crowd 
of Trump supporters in Michigan gathered along Capitol Avenue for Wednesday night's Christmas Extravaganza 
parade organized to take back the holiday season.[91]  Why Democrats Should Read the Navarro Report[92] As 
former U.S. Senate Patrick Moynihan used to say before the era of Big Tech, you're entitled to your own opinion, 
but not your own set of facts. The report White House advisor Peter Navarro recently compiled as a private citizen 
should be required reading for Democrats who insist there is 'no evidence' of widespread voter fraud. The Big Tech 
bosses who plaster disclaimers over the president's tweets should read it, too. Navarro looks at the six swing states 
whose results the Trump campaign has been contesting, and lays out a grid of election irregularities that swung all 
of those states to the Biden-Harris ticket in the days following the November 3rd election. 'These six dimensions 
include outright voter fraud, ballot mishandling, contestable process fouls, Equal Protection Clause violations, voting 
machine irregularities, and significant statistical anomalies,' he writes. He doesn't engage in conspiracy theories, or 
impute malign intent or foreign domination of voting machine companies. While those may be true, it will take a 
criminal investigation that could last years to prove them. In the real world, you don't often get to see the man 
behind the curtain, the Wizard of Oz of election fraud and voting machine manipulation. It's only in fiction that the 
mastermind has a name, a face, and a plot that rivets you to your chair. But what thrills in fiction becomes horror in 
the real world. Half of the country is still reeling in shock as they watch the Democrat National Committee and their 
communications directorate in the national media continue to gaslight us. We can't believe this is actually 
happening. We can't believe that in the real world   not some thriller   our democracy can be stolen right in front of 
Gates of Vienna News Feed 12/24/2020
our eyes. For the nature of the evidence Navarro sets out   the evidence the Democrats and the media screams 
doesn't exist   is glaringly obvious. As my father used to say, if it had been a bear it would have bitten you.[93]  
Wisconsin GOP Lawmakers Join Federal Lawsuit to Overturn Fraudulent Elections in Swing States WI, PA, GA, MI, 
And AZ[94] Wisconsin lawmakers signed onto a federal lawsuit to overturn the fraudulent elections in several swing 
states. Democrats shut down counting in these states on election night, dumped in tens of thousands of suspect 
ballots and stole several states that President Trump won. Never in US history has there been as much fraud in one 
presidential election. Two Republican state lawmakers in Wisconsin have signed onto the latest federal lawsuit 
seeking to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victories in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and 
Arizona.[95]  Woman Arrested for Sending Threats to Wayne County Republican Who Refused to Certify Vote; 
Threats Included Pics of Mutilated Bodies[96] A woman in New Hampshire has been arrested on federal charges 
after communicating a series of threats to Monica Palmer, chair of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, 
because Palmer had refused to certify the election for Biden in the wake of numerous accusations and proof of 
voter fraud. Threats included pictures of naked, mutilated bodies and pictures of Palmer's own daughter. The 
suspect, Katelyn Jones, apparently lives in Michigan, but was on vacation in Epping, NH when she was brought into 
custody. Her mugshot does not appear to be publicly available.[97]  'Xie, Ze, Yoself': Georgia State U Offers Absurd 
Ten Pronoun Options for Women's Classes[98] Georgia State University published an online sign-up for a women's 
business program that listed ten pronoun options. The university's J. Mack School of Business hosts a program 
called WomenLead, which 'equips female students to excel in school, enter the workforce with developed skills and 
find their place in leadership positions.' Although the program is specifically geared toward women, the program 
offered ten different choices for preferred pronouns on a registration form. Among the options were 'ey,' 'xie,' 'hir,' 
'vis,' and 'eirs.' 'Yoself' was also listed as an option alongside 'yo' and 'yos.'[99]  Ontario Pastor Charged $100,000 
and May Face Jailtime for Holding Worship Service[100] The Harvest Bible Church in Windsor, Ontario released a 
press statement on Thursday claiming that the church's lead pastor, Dr. Aaron Rock, has been fined up to $100,000 
and could face a year in prison for holding church services. 'Police also informed us that they will bar our 
congregation from entering the church on Christmas Eve, contrary to Section 176 of the Criminal Code and the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. We are deeply grieved by these unlawful and immoral acts, having 
already been banned from meeting on Good Friday and Easter Sunday,' a statement from the church reads.[101]  
Brexit Deal Signed: EU Boasts of a 'Good Deal' In Their Interest[102] The Brexit negotiations between the United 
Kingdom and the European Union concluded on Thursday, Christmas Eve, with the EU's Ursula von der Leyen 
calling a press conference and boasting the EU got a 'good deal' out of the years of negotiations. Speaking from 
Downing Street on Christmas Eve, Prime Minister Johnson announced the agreement of what he terms a 
'comprehensive, Canada-style free-trade deal'   an agreement that Mr Johnson has been seeking since the 
beginning of negotiations, which the European Union had said was impossible to strike. 'I'm very pleased to tell you 
that we have completed the biggest trade deal yet, worth 660 billion a year,' he said, continuing that the deal would 
protect British jobs by allowing 'UK goods to be sold without tariffs and without quotas in the EU market, which will if 
anything allow our companies to do even more business with our European friends.'[103]  France Forced to 
Postpone 'Health Dictatorship' Vaccine Legislation[104] A radical bill proposed by the French Government that 
would see unvaccinated people refused basic services such as public transport has been put on ice after a massive 
backlash. The proposed law mandates that citizens have proof of a negative COVID test or 'preventative treatment, 
including the administration of a vaccine' in order to 'access transport or to some locations, as well as certain 
activities.' However, the government has been forced to delay the legislation after angry protests.[105]  German 
Police Record Nearly 300 Politically Motivated Violent Incidents Related to Coronavirus[106] Since March, the 
German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has reported 297 politically motivated crimes relating to the 
coronavirus pandemic. The vast majority of the incidents, 160, were committed by far-left extremists, while 48 were 
related to the far-right. Eighty-nine offences, meanwhile, were not attributed to either category.[107]  Is This the 
Actual Nail Used in Jesus Christ's Crucifixion? Czech Archaeologists Tout Major Discovery[108] In the Milevsko 
Monastery, archaeologists say they have discovered a box with a cut-off part of a nail, which most likely comes 
from the so-called True Cross, upon which Jesus Christ was crucified. It is considered one of the rarest Christian 
relics. Archaeologists found the six-inch-long piece of nail in a secret cavity in the vault of the historic monastery. 
'From a historical point of view, from a symbolic point of view, this is even better than the Reliquary of St. Maurus, 
which is more than a meter tall and beautifully decorated chest. The nail was stored and lined with real gold. And for 
the medieval society, it was worth two monasteries,' said archaeologist Jiri Sindelar, who is a member of the group 
that found the nail.[109]  UK: Charles 'Considered Joining Extinction Rebellion' After Non-Violent Blockade Outside 
Gates of Vienna News Feed 12/24/2020
Home[110] PRINCE CHARLES reportedly once considered 'joining Extinction Rebellion' after the activists 
campaigned outside one of his royal estates, according to the protester organisation. The Prince of Wales has been 
renowned for championing green causes since the Eighties, long before environmentalism and action on climate 
change had become mainstream. He is now a respected figure within the conservation movement, and practises 
what he preaches, too. Charles featured in British Vogue this month to discuss his lifelong commitment to 
sustainable fashion and encouraged the public to move away from fast fashion.[111]  UK: Football Club Demands 
Fans Who Booed BLM Undergo Re-Education Courses Before Being Allowed Back[112] Cambridge United football 
club is demanding fans who booed players taking a knee for Black Lives Matter undergo re-education lessons or 
face a stadium ban. Yes, really. After a handful of fans voiced their displeasure before a December 15 game 
against Colchester, the club reacted by launching an investigation.[113]  UK: Farage: Deal Might Not be Perfect, 
But We've Made the Break, The Brexit Wars Are Over[114] Brexit leader Nigel Farage has advised exercising 
caution after the announcement that Boris Johnson and the EU had made an 11th-hour post-Brexit trade deal, until 
the details of the agreement are revealed, but said that today was nevertheless significant, and a 'tribute to the 
ordinary men and women who stood up against the Westminster establishment   and won'. Speaking to Sky News 
on Christmas Eve, Mr Farage expressed his concern that when the details of the deal are released, it could reveal 
that the UK remains close to EU regulations, bound to alignment with the bloc and prevented from becoming a 
competitive trading nation on the world's stage.[115]  UK: London Tier 4: Woman, 20, Faces 10K Fine After Hosting 
Illegal Party in Greenwich[116] A young woman who was caught hosting an illegal party in Greenwich has been told 
she faces a 10k fine. Police were called to Bessemer Place at 3.20am today (Thursday, December 24) following 
reports of a disturbance at a residential property. On arrival, officers came across 'a large group of people leaving 
the address'. It soon became clear an illegal gathering had been held and the crowds were dispersed.[117]  UK: 
Party Planners 'To Charge for Illegal Raves' During the Festive Season to Pay for COVID Fines[118] Party 
promoters will increase ticket prices for illegal raves to cover Covid fines as 'socially starved' revellers wave 
goodbye to 2020, i has learnt. In some cases, shrewd organisers will add a 10 levy on entrance fees to unregulated 
parties in private residences and warehouses abandoned by pandemic-hit businesses. Police have the power to 
issue fines of up to 10,000 to anyone caught organising gatherings of more than 30 people. But as many as 5,000 
illegal parties could take place over New Year's Eve weekend, according to the Night Time Industries Association 
(NTIA), the trade body representing 1,400 businesses including pubs, bars, nightclubs, and entertainment 
venues.[119]  With Europe's Borders Closed to Britain, Thousands of Trucks That Cannot Enter France Are 
Backlogged in UK[120] After a new strain of COVID-19 was identified in England, the nation is closed off from the 
rest of Europe and thousands of truckers are stranded in southern England. There are nearly 3,000 trucks waiting in 
the county of Kent, unable to return to France as the two nations engage in talks about the situation. Law 
enforcement near Dover, an English port, have recommended some truckers get tested for the virus locally, in case 
the countries soon reach a deal that would allow the truckers to leave.[121]  Jihad at Christmas: 'Coldly Kill Them 
With Hate and Rage'[122] This month, Islamic State terrorists released a 'religious' song for Christmas, 'Coldly Kill 
Them With Hate and Rage'. Taking the form of Islamic religious chant, the song, according to a report by the Middle 
East Media Research Institute, exhorts jihadists everywhere to murder non-Muslims, 'pagans, atheists and 
polytheists', from 'West Africa all the way to east Asia through air, land and sea'. Published on Telegram, the post 
includes the hashtag #MerryChristmas and a photograph of a Christmas tree with dynamite attached. Christmas is 
an attractive time for jihadists for three unattractive reasons. First and foremost, they are fighting a religious war and 
by far their numerically greatest enemies are Christians whose most prominent festival is Christmas. Second, large 
crowds joining festive events and filling shopping centres present a target-rich environment. Third, publicity: mass 
murder at this time of year guarantees additional outrage among Western countries and Christian communities 
everywhere. The Islamic State song enjoins its followers to 'make their media cry and broadcast'. The propaganda 
value is particularly powerful for jihadists intent on recruiting and motivating fighters and funders for their cause and 
creating division between communities aimed at inciting vengeance attacks against their fellow Muslims.[123]  
Singapore: Airline Officially Launches COVID Passport Ahead of 'Global Deployment'[124] Singapore Airlines has 
become the first carrier to officially launch a COVID passport, which will display the vaccination status and COVID 
test results of passengers. The airline announced that its 'digital health verification process' is the first in the world 
to be modelled on the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) Travel Pass framework. The airline said it 
had made the move to start trialling the process because it expects such 'immunity passes' to become the norm for 
all airline travel globally.[125]  Daughter of Billionaire Chinese Property Mogul With Strong Communist Party Links

Residents for Fire at Bosnia Migrant Centre[128] SARAJEVO (Reuters)   A fire at a migrant centre housing about 
1,200 people in northwestern Bosnia on Wednesday was probably set by migrants displeased with its temporary 
closure, police and a United Nations official said. Police in the town of Bihac said the fire, which destroyed four 
large tents at the Lipa camp, was extinguished quickly. No casualties were reported.[129]  Spain Rescues 49 
Migrants Near Gran Canaria[130] Spanish coast guards transported 49 migrants rescued in the Atlantic Ocean to 
Arguineguin port in the island of Gran Canaria on Wednesday. Red Cross members and health staff were seen 
taking at least three injured migrants into ambulances.[131]  Polish Professor Warns That God is Being Removed 
From Christmas, Even in Poland[132] Christmas, one of the most important celebrations for Christians, has a very 
deep religious meaning that is written into Polish national tradition and culture. In the interview with Catholic 
Television station Trwan, professor Mieczyslaw Ryba says that the Christmas tree, sharing the communion wafer, 
mutual kindness, and the midnight Christmas Eve mass are joined into particular traditions and customs which 
connect humanity and allow the faithful to live their lives through these events in such a deep manner. However, the 
professor noted that Christmas is undergoing a secularization of the holiday in Europe and even steadily in 
Poland.[133]  YouTube Hints Its Next 'Misinformation' Crackdown Will Curb Videos That Get Referral Traffic From 
Other Sites[134] Throughout 2020, YouTube has aggressively censored independent creators by implementing far-
reaching rules that prohibit content that questions or challenges the mainstream perspective on many newsworthy 
topics and boosting so-called 'authoritative' mainstream media outlets in search and recommendations. Yet in a 
recent update, the video-sharing platform hinted that it plans to introduce further restrictions that target videos that 
have lots of views because of referral traffic from other sites.[135] [ 1]: #434235 [ 2]: #434173 [ 3]: #434219 [ 4]:

Efforts to soften post-Brexit EU ownership rules snubbed
Efforts to soften post-Brexit EU ownership rules snubbed

With the impact of Brexit on the airline industry still not clear just days away from the end of the transition on 
December 31, France and Germany have reportedly rejected a softening of European Union rules that require EU-
flagged airlines to have EU nationals control over 50% of their ownership and voting rights. Spanish-led efforts, 
bolstered by support from Ireland and Hungary, have failed to loosen EU airline ownership rules in a draft post-
Brexit aviation agreement with the UK as part of a broader trade deal, two sources told Reuters. They are worried 
about Brexit's impact on IAG International Airlines Group as well as the likes of Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) and Wizz 
Air (W6, Budapest). As previously reported, British investors will no longer be classed as EU investors after the 
Brexit transition ends next week. 
This presents a dilemma for airline groups that have a majority-UK shareholder base as well as EU-licensed 
carriers. "There's been a last-ditch effort from a few member states to get something more liberal in the agreement 
on ownership and control," a source involved in the talks told the news agency. "There's not a hope in hell of it 
happening. The big pushback came from France and Germany." The European Commission believes that any 
relaxation of the rules could open the door to countries in the Middle East, for example, acquiring bigger stakes in 
EU carriers. Besides British Airways, IAG owns Aer Lingus, Iberia, and Vueling Airlines, but it has a substantial 
London shareholder base plus a 25% stake held by Qatar Airways, leaving EU investors as a small minority. IAG 
imposed a maximum limit on non-EU share purchases in February 2019 but removed it in January 2020. Ryanair 
has warned that its own majority of non-EU shareholders may lose their voting and share purchasing rights if there 
is not more flexibility to the European Union's rigid ownership rules. At Wizz Air, which is based in Budapest but 
listed in London, US-based minority shareholder Indigo Partners cut its stake in February to 3.4% from 20.6% in an 
effort to make the carrier more compliant with EU ownership rules. easyJet (U2, London Luton), dependent on its 
easyJet Europe (EC, Vienna) subsidiary for some of its network after Brexit, has also been trying to increase the 
number of its EU investors, who currently own about 45% of the group. These airlines claim that they are well-
prepared for Brexit and that their respective ownerships have been approved by national regulators under Brussels 
supervision. But concerns remain that they may be vulnerable to legal challenges instigated by competitors. IAG's 
transfer of most Iberia voting rights to the Madrid-based department store chain El Corte Inglés last year, for 
example, may not be seen in the courts as yielding, under the EU definition of control, "a decisive influence on the 
running of the business."

 Lastminute.com Group (LMN.SW), d/b/a LM Group, said Wednesday a court rejected Ryanair's (RYA.L) appeal 
against a previous decision allowing the company to sell the airline's flights.
Ryanair appealed against a 2019 decision by the Court of Lugano, which confirmed that the Swiss-based online 
travel and leisure group could lawfully continue to offer the possibility to compare and reserve Ryanair tickets 
through its websites.
The Appeal Court of Canton Ticino has now rejected all points challenged by Ryanair, concluding that LM Group's 
way of working is lawful.
Additionally, the court ruled that discredit campaigns launched by Ryanair against the company since 2008 were 
deliberate acts of unfair competition, and LM Group can now seek legal costs.
LM Group's stock gained over 2% on Wednesday's close.

Ryanair strikes crisis deal with German flight attendants

Ryanair has struck a deal with German flight attendants regarding pay cuts during the coronavirus crisis, the Irish 
budget airline and the German trade union Verdi said on Wednesday.
Ryanair said the deal encompasses moderate pay cuts to preserve jobs in Germany, following a similar agreement 
with German pilots.
Verdi representative Susana Pereira spoke of a very difficult decision for employees, although they ultimately 
consented.
The deal between Verdi and Ryanair's subsidiary Malta Air shields cabin employees from being fired due to 
operational reasons for the duration of the short-time work scheme.
Short-time work means employees are forced to reduce their hours and accept lower pay, while the government 
usually makes up part of the lost wages.
The 500 concerned employees agreed to renounce a planned increase in pay rates, a Verdi spokesperson said.
Both sides also agreed to extend a social plan until after the crisis.
The duration of the deal was left open, as well as the question of state subsidies.
Malta Air reiterated its calls for government support for its employees while they are on short-time work.
A row regarding state support of Malta Air's employees has been going on for half a year, as it is disputed whether 
Malta Air has business activity in Germany.
