airport 
plunged to an annual 2bn loss in 2020 as the pandemic closed borders and the government restricted most 
international travel, underlining the impact of Covid-19 on aviation.Britain's largest airport said the number of 
passengers who passed through slumped to 22.1 million last year, more than half of whom travelled in January and 
February, a fall of 73% compared with a year earlier and the smallest annual total since 1975. Cargo volumes also 
fell by 28% during 2020, although some dedicated cargo flights helped the airport to offset some of the lost 
passenger travel. 
However, Heathrow's chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said he thought it was 'very likely' that people would be 
able to go on summer holidays, following the prime minister's plan to allow international travel to resume from 17 
May, as part of the government's roadmap out of lockdown. 'For the aviation sector we can start to plan ahead for 
17 May to make sure we've got the people and the planes in place so that we can not just get people on their 
holidays but also get British businesses moving again,' Holland-Kaye told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 
Heathrow said it had acted quickly last year as coronavirus surged to cut its operating costs by slashing pay, 
closing one runway and two terminals, and raising money but warned that airports had very high fixed costs. 
Heathrow complained that government policies had effectively closed borders but that it had received no 
government support other than furlough. It said it had not benefited from business rates relief, unlike other airports, 
as well as retail, hospitality and leisure businesses. The airport is calling on the UK government to provide more 
support to the aviation sector in the March budget and is requesting 100% business rates relief, a further extension 
of the furlough scheme and a reversal of the tourist tax. The company has warned that Britain's economic recovery 
will be held back until long-haul passenger flights can restart, including to key markets such as the US. Airlines and 
travel companies reported a surge in holiday bookings on Tuesday, after Boris Johnson's announcement about 
England's roadmap for the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Companies including EasyJet, Ryanair, Tui and 
Thomas Cook said there had been a jump in bookings to destinations including Spain and Greece after the prime 
minister's announcement, although this remains subject to review. The green light for international travel is also 
dependent on the continued success of the vaccination programme and no resurgence in coronavirus cases. Read

https://bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-to-challenge-eu-court-ruling-on-french-and-swedish-state-aid/Ryanair is to 
appeal to the European court of justice after losing the first round of its legal battle against state bailouts granted to 
rival flag carrier airlines such as Air France-KLM and Scandinavia's SAS during the Covid-19 pandemic.Michael 
O'Leary, the chief executive of the Irish airline, had accused nation states of 'selectively gifting billions of euros to 
their inefficient flag carriers'. Ryanair has filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the European commission and 
various airlines over state-aid grants by European governments. 
However, on Wednesday the Luxembourg-based general court ruled that state bailouts awarded by the French and 
Swedish governments - and approved by the European commission - were in line with the bloc's rules. 'That aid 
scheme is appropriate for making good the economic damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and does not 
constitute discrimination,' the court said, referring to the French scheme. Regarding the Swedish scheme, the court 
said: 'The scheme at issue is presumed to have been adopted in the interest of the European Union.' Ryanair had 
taken issue with the European commission for clearing a French scheme allowing airlines to defer certain 
aeronautical taxes and Sweden's loan guarantee scheme for airlines. Both schemes benefited their flag carriers. 
Ryanair has filed 16 lawsuits against the commission for allowing state aid to individual airlines including Lufthansa, 
KLM, Austrian Airlines and Portugal's TAP, as well as national government schemes that mainly benefit flag 
carriers. Europe's biggest budget carrier said it would appeal the rulings at the EU's top court, arguing that the 
French and Swedish programs mainly benefited Air France-KLM and SAS AB and unfairly discriminated against 
other European carriers. Ultimate victory would 'give airlines and consumers a glimmer of hope that national 
politicians obsessed with their flag carriers will be sent back to the drawing board and required to use state aid 
wisely to assist the recovery of traffic in the post-Covid world instead of bailing out their favoured airline at the 
expense of fair competition and consumers', Ryanair said on Wednesday. O'Leary has previously said: 'These are 
the crack-cocaine junkies of the state-aid world because their first instinct is to always go to the government for 
state aid. We believe that any state aid in this crisis should be transparent and provided to everybody.' Read more:

Feb 17, 2021( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  The 
budget carrier had challenged national bailout schemes for rivals Air France and SAS in their respective home 
countries.Ryanair on Wednesday lost a legal fight in the European Union's second court against state aid being 
granted to virus-hit rivals Air France and SAS via national schemes.Judges at the EU's General Court in 
Luxembourg backed EU competition regulators who had allowed the support under loosened rules.What was 
Ryanair's complaint?European Commission state aid rules were loosened at the start of the pandemic.National 
governments offered more than 3 trillion euros ($3.65 trillion) in aid to companies across the 27-member bloc.The 
General Court was asked to assess a French scheme allowing airlines to defer certain aeronautical taxes, and to 
rule on Sweden's loan guarantee scheme for airlines.Ryanair has pursued a legal campaign across Europe to stop 
the bailouts, arguing the state aid gives an unfair advantage to prestigious state carriers.What did the court 
say?"That aid scheme is appropriate for making good the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic 
and does not constitute discrimination," the court said, referring to the French scheme.It also said the Swedish 
scheme was compatible with EU laws.

Feb 05, 2021( Adam Smith Institute Blog: http://www.adamsmith.org/blog Delivered by Newstex)  To leap free from 
an overweening bureaucracy is a benefit but we do then have to be careful about the home grown 
equivalents[1]:Ryanair's spat with the Civil Aviation Authority escalated on Wednesday night as plans emerged to 
axe all domestic routes and all services from Britain to non-EU countries. The budget carrier will only operate out of 
London Stansted airport and will cull 13 routes to Morocco, Ukraine, Montenegro, and Norway.We do sort of 
assume that consumers like being able to fly on Ryanair - we're not quite sure why, we've done it and enjoyment 
perhaps is not le mot juste - from non-Stanstead airports. After all, the airline gained customers by doing so and so 
those customers must have thought the bus in the sky approach worth it. 
So too about flights to non-EU countries from the UK. People took the deal on offer, it was an increase in consumer 
utility therefore.So, why the spat, why the action?A row erupted in December between Ryanair and the CAA over 
pre-Brexit rule changes. At the centre of the dispute is Ryanair's use of so-called 'wet-leasing', where airlines hire 
aircraft and crew to operate services on their behalf. Ryanair only has one UK-registered aircraft. The CAA wanted 
less than half of Ryanair's UK services to be run by 'wet leased' aircraft.No one is claiming that wet leased aircraft 
are less safe. If that were so then the CAA shouldn't allow them at all of course. But there is still this insistence:The 
CAA's Paul Smith said at the time: 'A UK airline with a significant presence in the UK, should not rely heavily on 
using wet-leased, foreign-registered aircraft.'Umm, why? We find it difficult to believe that the CAA is so hungry for 
the 146 registration fee[2] that they're willing to cause the severing of such international links.It is true that other 
countries - the EU itself - have weird rules about who may fly and where on what sort of registered aircraft. But 
that's exactly the sort of thing we've been trying to leap free of. As Joan Robinson said about trade itself, just 
because someone throws rocks in their own harbours no reason to chuck 'em in our own.At a deeper level this is 
akin to the shareholder primacy argument. That has the merit of there being the one single objective of a company. 
The same should be true of regulatory bodies - the one, single, simple, objective of the organisation. This being the 
consumer interest. That's what they're there for, to enable the maximisation of consumer utility and nothing else. 
The CAA is, perhaps simply as a result of amour propre, reducing the choices of consumers and thus acting against 
their, our, interests. The government should tell the CAA to go boil its head. After all, the entire point of the system 
is that they all work for us, in our interests. Something the CAA quite obviously isn't at present. [ 1]:

https://bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-jab-and-go-tv-ad-banned-for-encouraging-covid-19-risk-taking/The 
UK's 
advertising watchdog has banned Ryanair's controversial 'jab and go' holiday TV campaign, saying it encouraged 
the public to act irresponsibly once they have received a coronavirus vaccination shot.The Advertising Standards 
Authority's decision to ban the two TV ads, which have become the third most complained-about campaign of all 
time, comes days after the Ryanair chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said the vaccine programme would allow 
British families to flock to Europe for summer holidays this year. The ad campaign, which featured a small bottle 
labelled 'vaccine' and a syringe, encouraged the public to snap up bargain deals to sunny European destinations 
such as Spain and Greece because 'you could jab and go'. Launched on Boxing Day, the ad said 'Covid vaccines 
are coming so book your Easter and summer holidays today with Ryanair'. The ads showed groups in their 20s and 
30s engaged in activities such as jumping in a pool and being served at a restaurant, with no social distancing or 
use of face coverings. 
The campaign struck a nerve with the public, prompting 2,370 complaints to the ASA. Some complainants said it 
was misleading to suggest most people would be vaccinated by spring or summer and so be able to go abroad, and 
that being vaccinated meant no restrictions would be in place. Others said it was irresponsible because it 
encouraged people to believe that once they had even the first vaccination shot they would not need follow health 
restrictions. Ryanair said the assertions made in the ads were not out of step with government goals, and that they 
were designed to be 'uplifting and encourage viewers to consider a brighter future'. The airline told the ASA that the 
ads showed people 'holidaying in their social bubble' and that there were 'no requirements that holidaymakers be 
shown wearing face masks or social distancing'. The ASA ruled that the ads broke the UK ad rules relating to 
misleading and irresponsible advertising. 'We considered some viewers were likely to infer that by Easter and 
summer 2021 it would be possible for anyone to get vaccinated in order to go on a booked holiday, that maximal 
protection could be achieved immediately through one dose of the vaccine, and that restrictions around social 
distancing and mask wearing would not be necessary once individuals were vaccinated,' the ASA said in its ruling. 
'We considered this could encourage vaccinated individuals to disregard or lessen their adherence to restrictions, 
which in the short term could expose them to the risk of serious illness, and in the longer term might result in them 
spreading the virus. As such we considered the ads could encourage people to behave irresponsibly once 
vaccinated. The ads must not be broadcast again.' Ryanair said that while it would comply with the ad ban it 
Ryanair 'jab and go' TV ad banned for encouraging Covid-19 risk-taking
believed the ASA's decision was at odds with the success of the government's vaccination programme. 'The ASA's 
ruling flies in the face of the UK's successful vaccine rollout,' said a spokesman. 'However, even though this ruling 
is baseless, Ryanair will comply with it and the jab and go adverts will not run again.' A national newspaper ad by 
Paddy Power that promised losing punters their money back if South African athlete Oscar Pistorius was acquitted 
of allegedly killing his girlfriend is the most-complained about UK ad of all time, attracting 5,525 complaints and a 
ban. Travel company Booking.com is responsible for the second-most complained about ad, which substituted the 
word 'booking' for a well known swearword. The TV and cinema ad prompted 2,451 complaints that it encouraged 
foul language. The ASA dismissed the complaints saying it was a lighthearted play on words and viewers were 
likely to have picked up the swearword elsewhere. Read more: Ryanair 'jab and go' TV ad banned for encouraging

Feb 03, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
American Airlines AAL[1], Southwest Airlines LUV[2], JetBlue Airways JBLU[3] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] 
reported losses for fourth-quarter 2020. Results were hurt by dismal passenger revenues as air travel remained 
suppressed. Notably, the likes of Hawaiian Holdings and Alaska Air Group ALK[5] too met a similar fate when they 
posted their respective fourth-quarter numbers as mentioned in the previous week's write up[6].Meanwhile, United 
Airlines UAL[7] reportedly [8]warned roughly 14,000 employees that their jobs will be at risk with the expiry of the 
$15 billion worth second round of federal aid for the airlines on Mar 31, 2021. Consequently, labor unions are 
asking for more federal relief. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. American Airlines incurred a 
fourth-quarter 2020 loss (excluding 5 cents from non-recurring items) of $3.86 per share, comparing favorably with 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $3.92. However, the company delivered earnings per share of $1.15 in 
the year-ago quarter. Operating revenues of $4,027 million slumped 64.4% year over year but surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $3,859.2 million. 
American Airlines expects system capacity for the March quarter to nosedive 45% from the figure reported in first-
quarter 2019[9].2. JetBlue incurred a fourth-quarter 2020 loss (excluding 19 cents from non-recurring items) of 
$1.53 per share, comparing favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.72. However, operating 
revenues of $661 million plunged 67.4% year over year due to the 68.9% decrease in passenger revenues, which 
accounted for bulk (91.7%) of the top line. Revenues from other sources too declined 33.8% to $55 million. The top 
line, nonetheless, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $617.8 million[10].3. Southwest Airlines incurred a 
loss of $1.29 per share (excluding 25 cents from non-recurring items) in the fourth quarter of 2020, narrower than 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.69. However, operating revenues of $2,013 million lagged the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $2,117.5 million. The top line declined 64.9% year over year as well with passenger 
revenues, accounting for bulk (82.6%) of the top line, dropping 68.7%. The company predicts average core cash 
burn to worsen in the first quarter of 2021 to approximately $17 million per day from nearly $12 million in fourth-
quarter 2020[11].4. Ryanair, currently carrying a Zacks Rank# 4 (Sell), incurred a loss (excluding 8 cents from non-
recurring items) of $1.62 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 (ended Dec 31, 2020), narrower than the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.95. Results reflect coronavirus-induced disruptions in air-travel demand. 
Meanwhile, quarterly revenues of $406.9 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $495 million[12]. With air-
travel demand remaining suppressed, Ryanair's January traffic plunged 88% year over year. Load factor (% of

today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[13].5. In a customer-friendly move, Delta Air Lines DAL[14] and 
Italian carrier Alitalia are codesharing on COVID-tested flights operating between the United States and Italy. By 
producing a negative COVID-19 result prior to flying, passengers can avoid being in quarantine on their arrival at 
any of the two countries' airports. Per the deal, passengers can book to fly on Alitalia's dedicated COVID-tested 
flights from New York-JFK and Delta's COVID-tested flights from Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson International airport. 
Both fly to Rome's Fiumicino airport. Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major 
airline players over the past week and during the past six months.The table above shows that majority of the airline 
stocks have traded in the red over the past week. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has dipped almost 
1% over the past week to $82.97. Meanwhile, over the course of the past six months, the sector tracker has surged

Europe brings back Boeing 737 MAX

Jan 27, 2021( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Airlines 
operating in Europe such as TUIfly or Ryanair can fly the 737 MAX again after its grounding. But are they really 
needed   and will passengers be willing to board? Andreas Spaeth is looking for answers.The European Union 
Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said Wednesday that it had cleared the Boeing 737 MAX to fly again in European 
skies, paving the way for a comeback of the controversial airplane at least in theory. 
In practice though, no airline seems overly keen to redeploy the former Boeing bestseller in a hurry. No carrier 
needs extra capacity right now. Rather, aircraft parking, deferral of deliveries or even cancellations of aircraft orders 
are the new normal as the pandemic hits passenger aviation hard.A total of 641 orders for the 737 MAX were 
canceled in 2020 alone and Boeing removed from its order books another 523 seen as unlikely to be fulfilled, 
currently leaving 3,333 planes of the model to be delivered over the next few years. The US, Canada and Brazil 
paved the way for the return of the aircraft. Since late 2020, their respective aviation safety authorities have allowed 
the Boeing 737 MAX back into the skies with passengers, for the first time since the global grounding of the aircraft 
back in March 2019.It took that long for Boeing to redesign a software blamed to have contributed to two crashes in 
2018 and 2019, in which a total of 346 passengers were killed. The authorities needed time to thoroughly test the 
modified software.No unified global approachWhile other important markets like China and India still keep the 737 
MAX on the ground for the time being, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) had been busy in recent days 
touting its plan to also recertify the aircraft."The MAX will be cleared to fly again this week in Europe," said EASA 
Executive Director Patrick Ky on Monday in a hearing of the Transport Committee of the European Parliament. A 
team of 20 EASA experts had worked for two years to recertify the aircraft."In order to fly again, there are a certain 
number of prerequisites to fulfil by the aircraft; we have asked for software updates, rewiring and a certain number 
of things which we uncovered during our certification works, and also a lot of training which will be necessary for the 
pilots," said Ky.The EASA director cited four conditions that had to be met before his authority would grant a 
recertification to Boeing's former bestseller: First, fully understand what happened in the two accidents. Second, 
solving all problems with systems that contributed to the accidents, mostly the MCAS automated trimming 
system.Also, EASA insisted on reviewing certain components deemed safety-critical by the Europeans, as the 
authority didn't review them itself in the original MAX certification, being only the secondary certification authority 
then after the leading US aviation agency, FAA.Pilot training a priorityAnd the final condition was to ensure that 
pilots were properly trained how to operate the MAX. "We are now reaching a stage where we are confident that 
these four prerequisites are met and that's why we will allow the aircraft to go back to service," assured Patrick 
Ky.The 737 MAX crisis has been causing a major shake-up in procedures established for decades, with almost all 
Europe brings back Boeing 737 MAX
other certification authorities around the world used to almost automatically rubber-stamp FAA decisions and 
certifications. These procedures couldn't be continued anymore after what happened."We need to work more on 
how we work together with the FAA and how we complement each other, as it obviously didn't work well for the 
MAX," the head of EASA stressed in a recent press briefing, while acknowledging: "For the recertification of the 
MAX we had full transparency from Boeing and the FAA.This doesn't mean we were aligned and agreed every 
time, but we worked very well together." EASA is now satisfied that the 737 MAX is a 100% safe aircraft after the 
required modifications have been done."We have tested the 737 MAX even without MCAS, and it would be safe to 
fly not using the system at all," Ky pointed out. EASA's director had good news for low-cost carrier Ryanair, still 
awaiting delivery of the first of a total of 210 737 MAX-200s. In December, Ryanair topped up an earlier order, 
wanting an additional 75 planes.Supply and demand"We are also certifying the 200 variant of the MAX these days 
and expect certification to be ready in the coming weeks, so the aircraft should be ready to fly in the summer," said 
Ky. While low-cost carriers such as Ryanair are viewed as the first airlines that will see passengers returning, other 
European MAX customers are less enthusiastic. Among them is German holiday airline TUIfly, which was supposed 
to get its very first 737 MAX of 25 on order delivered on the very night in March 2019 when it was 
grounded."Currently, it is totally unclear when our MAXs might see entry into service from Germany, as not many 
flights are operating," said spokesperson Aage Dünhaupt. German-Turkish holiday airline SunExpress has ordered 
42 737 MAX, which are now supposed to arrive between the end of 2021 and 2028/29. In various polls, many 
passengers have indicated their reluctance to board a 737 MAX.That's why all airlines reintroducing it offer free 
rebookings on non-MAX flights, but this option has hardly been used in the US and Canada since the aircraft's 
return. Aviation experts believe most people will forget about the MAX problems once it has become a reliable 
workhorse, as the earlier Boeing 737 models have always been ever since Lufthansa put the world's first 737 into 
service in February 1968.

Jan 27, 2021( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Boeing 737 Max 
has flown over 2,700 passenger flights across 5,500 hours since November 2020. Five airlines currently fly 
passengers on the Max in the US, Canada, Brazil, Panama, and Mexico. The European Union Aviation Safety 
Agency approved the Max to fly passengers on Wednesday. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more 
stories[1].Boeing has put a considerable amount of distance between the 20-month grounding of its 737 Max and 
now to the tune of more than 2,700 flights and around 5,500 flight hours, the manufacturer announced on 
Wednesday."We made significant progress on the 737 program this quarter," Dave Calhoun, Boeing's chief 
executive officer, said. "This is the culmination of a comprehensive effort including roughly 400,000 engineering 
hours, 1,400 test and check, and over 3,000 flight hours completed on the airplane."The Federal Aviation 
Administration cleared the Max to fly again on November 18[2], with regulators in Latin America, Canada, and most 
recently, the European Union following suit. 
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency gave Boeing's troubled aircraft the green light on Wednesday, 
allowing airlines like Ryanair, Norwegian Air Shuttle, and Icelandair, among others, to finally resume Max 
flights.Middle Eastern, African, and Asian-Pacific countries remain the most notable outliers in resuming Max flights, 
with China, in particular, continuing to wait on the recertification. Calhoun said that any outstanding approvals from 
foreign regulators should come in the first half of 2021.And despite the aircraft's infamous reputation, airlines are 
reporting that flight loads remain in line with other aircraft, indicating that flyers aren't actively avoiding the Max. 
Anticipated passenger skepticism over flying on the Max prompted airlines to offer flexible change policies that 
allow flyers to change off the aircraft[3].Read more: The 16 most outrageous things Boeing employees said about 
the company, 737 Max program, and each other in released internal emails[4]The first priority for Boeing is to get 
the already-delivered Max aircraft flying again. Only five airlines have resumed flying their Max planes again and 
new regulatory approvals will mean more will be doing so in the upcoming weeks and months. "Every airline has 
different operational considerations for returning planes to revenue service and timelines for training their pilots," 
Calhoun said. "We're supporting each of them as they go through their process."Gol Linhas Areas was the first 
airline to resume Max flights in early December[5], soon followed by Aeromexico on December 21 and American 
Airlines on December 29.American, despite its late start, is proving to be the primary driver of Max flights as it

continues to grow its route network with the aircraft[6]. In March, American's 737 Max aircraft will be flying as far 
west as San Diego, California, as far north as Boston, and as far south as Manaus, Brazil, according to Cirium 
data.United Airlines will resume Max flights on February 11 from Denver and Houston[7] while Southwest Airlines 
will launch its first Max flights sometime in March[8], the latest of any US airline that flew the Max before its March 
2019 grounding.Simultaneously, Boeing will continue to deliver new Max aircraft to airlines as new-builds been 
sitting idle at airports across the country and in Seattle-area parking lots. Deliveries of the 450-aircraft backlog 
resumed in December and more than 40 aircraft have been delivered since then."Prior to delivery, teams are 
performing all the necessary tests and ensuring each airplane receives customized care and rolls into a delivery 
stall ready for customer acceptance and FAA review," Calhoun said.Alaska Airlines just took delivery of its first Max 
on January 23[9], the fourth and final US airline to receive the Max for now, with plans for a March 1 debut. The 
Seattle-Los Angeles and Seattle-San Diego routes will be the first to see the aircraft on its launch day.Boeing lost 
hundreds of Max orders due to the aircraft's grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic but new orders continue to 
come in. Since the ungrounding, Ireland's Ryanair placed a 75-aircraft Max order[10], Alaska grew its firm Max 
order to 68 airplanes[11], and Canada's Flair Airlines just leased 13 Max aircraft.Billions, however, remain to be 
paid in compensation to customers due to the protracted grounding."Cumulatively, we've accrued a $9.6 billion 
liability for the estimated potential concessions and other considerations," Gregory Smith, Boeing's chief financial 
officer, said on the 737 Max. "To date, we've made $3.7 billion in payments to customers in cash and other forms of 
compensation, including $600 million we paid this quarter."But the largest hurdle to Boeing's comeback following 
two fatal crashes with the Max has been overcome as the aircraft is once again back in the skies and as a result, 
deliveries have resumed and orders are once again coming in."Following one of the most rigorous certification 
efforts in aviation history, we're confident in the safety of our airplane," Calhoun said. Read the original article on

that have been very badly hit such as airlines, with companies such as Ryanair and Whizz, which have seen 'a lot 
of competition fall away as well as a huge pent up demand for travel and hospitality and a high level of savings for 
those people who have been able to carry on working'. He goes on to say that the survivors will be able to move

Jan 13, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With renewed lockdowns 
in the UK, Ireland and some other countries in Europe following the surge in coronavirus cases with the new COVID 
strain being found in the United Kingdom last month, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] 
trimmed its forecast for fiscal 2021 (ending Mar 31, 2021) traffic.Delta Air Lines DAL[2] and United Airlines UAL[3] 
were also in news, courtesy of their managerial decisions to revise their policies pertaining to emotional support 
animals on their flights. The move followed theU.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) decision to tighten the 
rule pertaining to passengers travelling with service animals on board.Update on American Airlines' AAL[4] move on 
the above issue was mentioned in the previous week's write-up[5].Meanwhile, gross revenues at the Latin 
American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[6] surged 52% to R$852 million in December on a month-over-month basis as 
air-travel demand picks up in the carrier's domestic markets. Notably, Gol is currently operating all the bases in its 
domestic network Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Ryanair expects its January traffic to be less 
than 1.25 million. The expectation is much less than the air traffic of 1.9 million recorded in December. 
The effect of a fresh shutdown is expected to be more emphatic on the traffic numbers of February and March. This 
European carrier, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects traffic in each of these two months to be as 
low as 500,000. Naturally, the carrier lowered its traffic forecast for fiscal 2021. It now expects[7] the metric for the 
period in the 26-30 million range compared with its earlier prediction of below 35 million. You can see the complete 
list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8].2. From Jan 11, 2021, United Airlines is allowing only 
service animals to accompany passengers in cabins free of cost. However, for tickets booked before the said date 
to travel on or before Feb 28, 2021, the airline is continuing with its usual policy of transporting emotional support 
animals free of cost. Customers planning to fly with their animals (that are not service animals) after Feb 28 will 
have to pay a service charge of $125 each way for carrying them in cabins or in cargo hold.Delta is also not 
accepting bookings pertaining to emotional support animals on its flights Jan 11 onward. However, the carrier is 
allowing passengers, who already booked tickets prior to the specified date, to travel with their emotional support 
animal(s) as scheduled. Per the DOT's new ruling, only dogs qualify as service animals. Going by the more 
stringent regulation, a service animal is defined as a 'dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for 
the benefit of a person with a disability'.3. Gol Linhas' management stated that load factor (% of seats filled by 
passengers) was 81% in December, reflecting the uptick in air-travel demand. This January, the airline plans to

operate approximately 550 flights per day and nearly 620 daily flights on peak days, representing 65% of last 
January's domestic flight schedule. For the fourth quarter of 2020 (detailed results of which will be available on Feb 
25), Gol Linhas estimates EBITDA margin to be 30-32%. Meanwhile, EBIT margin is expected to be 18-20%. 
Average fuel price per liter is anticipated between R$2.31 and R$2.37. Total demand and capacity are expected to 
be down 42% each in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, total seats are estimated to plunge 46% year over year[9].4 At 
Azul AZUL[10], consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger kilometers) declined 31.4% year over year to 
2.03 billion due to a 10.6% drop on the domestic front and an 85.3% fall, internationally. On a year-over-year basis, 
consolidated capacity (measured in available seat kilometers) decreased 28.4% to 2.54 billion. This downside was 
caused by a 9% contraction in domestic capacity and an 81.4% plunge in international capacity. With traffic decline 
outpacing capacity reduction, load factor deteriorated 350 basis points to 80%[11].5. As air-travel demand for 
leisure continues to improve, Alaska Air Group's ALK[12] subsidiary Alaska Airlines plans to introduce two routes 
from Southern California during the spring season. Starting Mar 18, 2021, the airline will begin a daily non-stop 
service connecting Los Angeles and Austin. On May 20, services on this route will increase to three departures on a 
daily basis. With the new flight service to Austin, the carrier will fly to more than 40 non-stop destinations from Los 
Angeles this spring. Moreover, a daily non-stop flight between San Diego and New York will commence on Apr 4. 
This nonstop operation is part of Alaska Air's expansion in the Northeast. During springtime, the airline will have a 
non-stop service connecting San Diego with both Newark and Boston. Performance The following table shows the 
price movement of major airline players over the past week and during the past six months.The table above shows 
that the most airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week, even though the gains were muted in 
nature. Evidently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has risen marginally to $82.60 in the period. Over the course of the 
past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has appreciated 50%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors 
will keenly await Delta's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings report, scheduled to be announced tomorrow (Jan 14). The 
Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast 
through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but 
that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best

10 
Complained About BrandThe brand which drew the most complaints across the last five years was Roofoods 
(better known as Deliveroo), with 323 complaints across three different rulings. The most notable ad which people 
weren't happy about was their 'magic bag' TV advert. The ad saw a woman collecting a Mary Poppins-style bag 
containing meals from numerous different restaurants[7], which, as anyone who has ordered from Deliveroo before 
will know, isn't actually possible on the app. Amazon Europe followed in second place, with 299 complaints across 
eight different rulings. The majority of complaints related to the one-day delivery service, part of Amazon Prime 
Membership. Customers complained that their packages didn't arrive within the promised time, and that many items 
are not available for next day delivery. Ryanair ranked at No.5 with 183 complaints made by consumers. This is 
expected to increase following the controversy caused by their recent 'jab and go' advert. The ASA have launched 
an investigation to see whether the budget airline broke advertising rules.The Top 5 Most Commonly Complained 
About Topics The most complained about topic was 'food, drink and supplements', with a total of 757 complaints. 
This included the misleading Deliveroo advert mentioned above, as well as ads from KFC and Philadelphia. The 
research also analyses a total of 1,935 complaints made to the ASA over the last five years or so - of which, the

Jan 08, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Ryanair 
Holdings RYAAY[1] dipped 1.6% to $108.16 on Jan 7 following lackluster projections for January, February and 
March air traffic as well as for fiscal 2021 (ending Mar 31, 2021). The renewed lockdowns in the UK, Ireland and 
some other countries in the EU following the surge in coronavirus cases with a new strain being found in the United 
Kingdom last month induced such dull predictions. Experts believe that the new variant of the virus is potentially 
more contagious. What Did Ryanair Say?
 The Irish carrier perceives that the fresh lockdowns and other travel-related restrictions will shrink air-travel 
demand further, thus forcing it to cut its flight schedules from Jan 21. Following this decision, only a handful (if any) 
of flights will operate to/from Ireland or the UK until the removal of the travel embargo.As a result of the constraints, 
the low-cost carrier expects its traffic in the current month to be less than 1.25 million. The expectation is much less 
than the air traffic of 1.9 million recorded in December. The effect of a fresh shutdown is expected to be more 
pronounced on the traffic numbers of February and March. This European carrier expects traffic in each of the two 
months to be as low as 500,000. Naturally, the carrier trimmed its traffic forecast for fiscal 2021. It now expects the 
metric for the period in the 26-30 million range compared with its earlier prediction of below 35 million. However, 
Ryanair does not expect a material impact on its net loss for fiscal 2021 due to the lockdown-induced revisions. 
This is because many of the flights cancelled would have run at a loss.The 'slow pace of vaccine rollouts' in the UK 
and Ireland clearly left Ryanair frustrated. As a result, management appealed to the governments in those countries 
to accelerate the same. In fact, Ireland's sluggishness irked the carrier's executive leadership so much that the 
latter demanded an explanation from the former at an administrative level on why Denmark, which has a population 
equivalent to Ireland's 5 million, could complete vaccinating 40,000 people as of Jan 6, which is 10 times more than 
what Ireland could achieve until now. Zacks Rank &#38; Key Picks Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold). Investors interested in the broader Zacks Transportation sector may consider stocks like Ryder System R[2], 
FedEx Corporation FDX[3] and Herc Holdings HRI[4], each presently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You 
can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[5]Shares of Ryder, FedEx and Herc Holdings have 
jumped more than 78%, 57% and 140% over the past six months, respectively. More Stock News: This Is Bigger

Jan 06, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings' 
RYAAY[1] December traffic declined 83% year over year to 1.9 million guests as coronavirus continues to weigh on 
air-travel demand.On a rolling-annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion unit) plunged 66% to 
52.1 million. The carrier's load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in the month was 73%.Amid 
coronavirus-led travel restrictions and aircraft groundings, the carrier's traffic dropped 80% year over year during 
the first half of fiscal 2021. More than 99% of the airline's fleet was grounded from mid-March to June-end. The 
company incurred a loss of  410.5 million in the first half of fiscal 2021. Ryanair expects losses to be even higher in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
fiscal 
2021.

(November-March) to be only 40% of 2019 levels. 
Additionally, during second-quarter fiscal 2021 earnings release, management forecast fiscal 2021 traffic to be only 
around 38 million. This indicates a significant decline from 60 million predicted during first-quarter fiscal 2021 
earnings release, which again denotes a massive drop from fiscal 2020 traffic of 149 million. Zacks Rank &#38; Key 
Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation[4] sector 
are ArcBest Corp. ARCB[5], Ryder System R[6] and Herc Holdings HRI[7], each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong

Jan 03, 2021( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  MADRID - Blame COVID-19 
travel restrictions or Brexit but whatever the cause, some British citizens trying to return to their homes in several 
European countries this weekend have been barred from boarding flights.Airlines refused documents that before 
Brexit had been valid proof of the Britons' status as residents in Spain, Italy and Germany, although Spanish 
authorities claimed that the issue had been resolved by mid-Sunday.Their ordeal came amid heightened travel 
restrictionsbecause ofa coronavirus variant that has been blamed for faster contagion inBritainand highlights the 
bureaucratic complexities resulting from Britain's departure from the 27-nation European Union.Both Spanish and 
British authorities said Sunday that the green-colored certificate of EU citizenship with a foreign national 
identification number issued by Spain is still valid for British citizens residing in Spain under the bilateral provisions 
that followedBritain's withdrawal from the bloc on December31. But the travelers say British Airways and Iberia, 
which are part of the IAG group, have been refusing to let them board for the past two days. Iberia said in a 
statement late Sunday that a communication from Spain's border police January1 had created "some confusion" 
and that it was later clarified. British Airways didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.Around 300,000 
British citizens are registered as permanent residents in Spain, although before Brexit, many more had been living 
full or parttime in the country without officially registering.Patricia Moody, a 69-year-old retiree who has called the 
southern Spanish town ofZurgenahome for nearly four years, was among a group of at least nine people unable to 
board a Madrid-bound BA/Iberia flight from London's Heathrow Airport on Saturday.Moody said she and her 
husband, who she says needs to see his doctor back in Spain, have spent 1,900 pounds ($2,600) on getting tested 
for the virus, traveling to the airport and booking new tickets after they were refused boarding. 
Their second attempt was also futile."Throughout all the months of negotiating Brexit, we were always assured that 
nothing would change for us," she said. Referring to the airlines and authorities in both countries, she added: "It's 
horrendous and we are suffering because of their incompetence."Following the discovery of the coronavirus variant 
inBritain, many European nations have banned all travel from theBritish Islesexcept for their own nationals 
andBritishcitizens with residency rights. Travelers to Pisa, Italy, and Berlin have also reported similar hurdles in 
boarding planes operated by Ryanair and Lufthansa despite carrying documents that had been accepted by the 
Italian and German governments, respectively.Matt Bristow, a spokesman for the British in Germany association of 
residents in that country, said: "This appears to be a case of U.K. airport staff not knowing what documents to 
accept or applying the rules more stringently than the German border police would."Spain has been rolling out a 
new system to register permanent foreign residents called TIE,but it's suffering a backlogbecause ofthe high 
number of requests. Authorities told AP that proof of application for the TIE and the "green certificate" for EU 
Britons Flying Home to Spain Caught in Post-brexit Red Tape
citizens were still valid to travel for British residents under the new health restrictions in place until January19. "This 
should not be happening," theBritishembassy in Spain said in a Facebook post. "The Spanish authorities have 
today re-confirmed that the green residency document will be accepted for travel to return to Spain, as stated in our 
travel advice."But Sam Dakin, a 32-year-old English-language teacher based in Barcelona for the last four years, 
and his partner, who has been in the Spanish city foreightyears, said they needed more assurances before they 
could rebook flights.The couple had been blocked from flying Saturday morning despite carrying their certificate and 
then were refused boarding on another flight Saturday evening that British Airways had initially said they could 
take."Just because the government adviser said that we could travel, we don't know whether that will happen when 
we turn up at the counters," Dakin said. "We just don't know where we're going to get answers."In a statement, 
Spain's Foreign Ministry said there had been "an isolated communication problem with some airlines that affected a 
very small number of travelers" and that air traffic between the U.K. and Spain was proceeding "with normality" by 
mid-Sunday.

Dec 31, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
American Airlines AAL[1] restarted commercial flight services using Boeing's 737 MAX jets. With this, the company 
became the first U.S.-based carrier to resume operations through the 737 MAX jets, ever since the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) gave its green signal in November to the aircraft for taking to the skies. Notably, the jets, 
manufactured by The Boeing Company BA[2], remained grounded since March 2019 after being involved in two 
deadly accidents in different parts of the world within a span of few months.Meanwhile, European low-cost carrier 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] reportedly [4]chose to strip its UK shareholders of their voting rights, once Britain 
leaves the EU tomorrow, in a bid to comply with the EU rules on airline ownership. Hungary-based Wizz Air also 
took similar action.Alaska Air Group's ALK[5] subsidiary Alaska Airlines was also in news, courtesy of its decision to 
ban emotional support animals on its flights, shortly.The move followed theU.S. Department of Transportation's 
order to tighten the rule pertaining to passengers travelling with service animals on flights Recap of the Past Week's 
Most Important Stories 1 American Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), operated its first 737 Max 
flight on the Miami-New York route on Dec 29. Maintaining its pro-customer stance, the carrier is providing flexibility 
to customers for switch flights in case they are skeptical of flying on the Boeing 737 Max. 
The Boeing 737 MAX aircraft is sought after in the airline space, mainly because of its fuel efficiency. Other U.S. 
airlines which have these jets in their fleet are United Airlines UAL[6] and Southwest Airlines LUV[7]. United Airlines 
plans to start flying the MAX aircraft on Feb 11, 2021[8]. Southwest Airlines expects to resume commercial flight 
services in March 2021 using the planes, per the previous week's write up[9].You can seethe complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[10]2. From Jan 11, Alaska Airlines will only allow service dogs to 
accompany passengers on its flights. However, for tickets booked prior to that date for travel on or before Feb 28, 
2021, the airline will continue with its usual policy of transporting emotional support animals. The complete ban on 
emotional support animals will be effective after Feb 28.[11]3. Per a FOX Business report[12], Southwest Airlines' 
CEO Gary Kelly stated that the pay cuts or furloughs are no longer anticipated at the Dallas-based carrier in 2021 
following the outgoing President Donald Trump's decision to sign the $900 worth relief package bill. With the 
president's stamp of approval, the bill became a law. The new package includes a $15-billion grant to the U.S. 
airlines. With this fresh payroll aid, United Airlines and American Airlines are also contemplating calling back their 
laid-off employees.4. Despite the rise in coronavirus cases in the United States, the final weekend of 2020 (Dec 26

and Dec 27) was a busy one for the U.S. airlines. This can be gauged from theTransportation Security 
Administration[13](TSA) data. The TSA reported that 1,128,773 and 1,284,589 passengers passed through the TSA 
checkpoints on Dec 26 and Dec 27, respectively. Notably, this has been the busiest weekend in the past nine 
months. Performance The following table shows the price movement of key airline players over the past week and 
during the past six months.The table above shows that almost all airline stocks have traded in the green over the 
past week, leading the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to gain 2.1% to $83.16. Over the course of the past six months, 
the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has soared 53.6%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will keenly await

Dec 21, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The year 2020, which is 
in its last leg, has been anything but fruitful for stocks in the airline space. Agreed that most sectors were hurt by the 
advent of coronavirus, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March, the bitter truth is 
that the aviation industry still remains one of the worst-affected areas in the investment world.Passenger revenues, 
which constitute bulk of the top line for the airline companies, have been drastically low do far as air-travel demand 
took a severe beating due to lockdowns and travel restrictions.The sorry state of affairs can be gauged from the 
International Air Transport Association's (IATA) gloomy forecast for 2020. Per the IATA[1], the industry is expected 
to incur a staggering net loss of $118.5 billion in 2020. Passenger revenues are anticipated to be a mere $191 
billion compared with $612 billion recorded in 2019. This gigantic fall in passenger revenues is mainly due to the 
year-over-year anticipated plunge of 66% in overall passenger demand for the current year.Region-wise, North 
American carriers are projected to endure maximum net loss to the tune of $45.8 billion in these coronavirus-
ravaged times with traffic plummeting 66%. European carriers including the likes of Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] are 
expected to incur $26.9 billion losses with traffic sinking 70%. Latin American carriers with the likes of Copa 
Holdings CPA[3] and Gol Linhas GOL[4] are projected to lose $5 billion with traffic tanking 60%. Moreover, those in 
the Asia-Pacific area are expected to suffer losses amounting to $31.7 billion in 2020. Carriers in the Middle East 
and Africa are likely to incur losses worth $7.1 billion and $2 billion, respectively, during the current year. 
Vaccine News Buoys Airline Stocks With the pandemic still claiming thousands of lives across the globe, apart from 
infecting many more, multiple medical companies are spending billions on developing an effective vaccine to 
combat the dreaded disease. In this respect, Pfizer PFE[5] and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine won the regulatory 
emergency approval in many countries including the UK and the United States after displaying a high degree of 
efficacy in clinical trials. Following this agency nod, vaccination started in the concerned countries.More recently, 
Moderna's vaccine was also okayed by the FDA for emergency use. It goes without saying that the company's 
vaccine was found to be highly effective in its clinical trials. The Moderna vaccine will be shortly administered in the 
United States.In fact, the positive updates on the above vaccines have led the Zacks Airline[6] industry gain 4.7% 
over the past month, outperforming the S&#38;P 500 Index's 3.5% appreciation in the same time period.The 
principal gainers from the airline space during this period were Mesa Air Group MESA[7], American Airlines AAL[8], 
Spirit Airlines SAVE[9] and United Airlines UAL[10], all currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[11]. The price performance of the stocks over the 
4 Airline Stocks Took Off on Vaccine Hopes: Can They Keep Flying in 2021?
past month is given in the chart below. Will the Uptick Continue in 2021? The year 2021 is expected to be brighter 
for the airlines in view of the above vaccines and many more in various stages of development. The availability of 
the vaccines is a major boost to the airline companies, which are pinning hopes on people's return to air travel, 
once vaccinated, as there will be no fear of infection looming on. This, in turn, should boost passenger 
revenues.Another encouraging development for the airlines is the agreement reached by the U.S. Congress to 
approve $900 billion for a fresh coronavirus-relief package. The tentative deal inked yesterday comes after months 
of negotiations following the expiry of the CARES Act on Sep 30.The new package includes a $15-billion grant to 
the U.S. airlines toward new payroll assistance, per a BNN Bloomberg report[12]. Notably, carriers like American 
Airlines and United Airlines shrunk their respective workforces due to the suppressed demand scenario following 
the expiry of the CARES Act on Sep 30. Now the new payroll aid allows them to call back the laid-off 
employees.Apart from the upbeat news on the airline jobs front, that 2021 is likely to see an improvement for the 
aviation industry compared to 2020 can be gauged from IATA's bullish forecast. Total loss for the industry is 
envisioned to come down to $38.7 billion next year. IATA anticipates 2.8 billion people taking to the skies in 2021, 
one billion more than the current-year expectation. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) is likely to surge to 
72.7% next year from the projection of 65.5% for 2020.Even though passenger revenues are unlikely to return to 
the pre-coronavirus levels in 2021 itself, we expect the stocks in the airline domain to have a much better time next 
year owing to the aforementioned tailwinds. Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2021 In addition to the stocks discussed 
above, would you like to know about our 10 top tickers for the entirety of 2021?These 10 are painstakingly hand-

Dec 07, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Boeing Company 
BA[1] recently secured orders for 75 additional 737 MAX airplanes from Europe's largest airline   Ryanair   marking 
the first ever order for this plane since it received flight clearance from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration 
('FAA'). Naturally this instilled confidence among investors, as is evident from the rise in share price following the 
news.Boeing's shares gained 4% to touch $232.71 on Dec 4 buoyed by Ryanair's order, which thereby boosted the 
airlines' order book for 737 MAX to 210 jets. Boeing's History With Ryanair Ryanair has been one of Boeing's major 
clients since 2014. The airline company placed its first order for 100 737 MAX airplanes and 100 more in late 2014, 
followed by firm orders of 10 airplanes in 2017 and 25 in 2018. The new orders will enable Ryanair to configure its 
aircraft with 197 seats, thus increasing revenue potential and reduce fuel consumption by 16% compared to the 
airline's previous airplanes. Significance of the Deal At a time when the entire aerospace industry is witnessing 
extreme downturn, and Boeing having faced around 460 order cancellations for the 737 MAX jets this year, the new 
deal bode well for the company. This deal will further boost the company's confidence in approaching other buyers 
for the 737 MAX jets. 
What's Favoring Boeing Of Late? The recent orders placed by Ryanair is likely a result of the approval given by the 
FAA last month to Boeing, which now certifies the 737 MAX safe for flying, after series of upgrades to the plane and 
pilot training protocols, and regulatory interventions.The approval, after a long layover of grounding since March 
2019, has bought a huge relief to both Boeing and its customers that operate the 737 MAX jets worldwide. 
Evidently, the company's beleaguered 737 MAX jets, which have been constantly losing orders over a past few 
months, are now showing signs of recovery.While Ryanair has already signed a purchase deal for 737 Max, other 
airlines also seem to be interested in this freshly upgraded plane. Notably, following the FAA's approval, Delta Air 
Lines DAL[2] Chief Executive Officer, Ed Bastian hinted at possibilities of purchasing Boeing's 737 Max, per a 
Reuter's report[3]. Moreover, Southwest Airlines LUV[4] is in discussions with Boeing for sealing a purchase deal of 
up to 30 737 MAX jets, as stated in a Bloomberg report in November. Alaska Air ALK[5] also announced plans of 
leasing 13 new Boeing 737-9 MAX jets as part of its fleet modernization efforts.In line with such promising 
developments, Boeing remains focused on safely returning the full 737 fleet to service and delivering the backlog of 
airplanes to Ryanair and its other customers worldwide. This, is turn, should help the jet maker bring its commercial 
business on a positive growth trajectory. Price Performance &#38; Zacks Rank Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) 
company have gained 44.4% in the past three months compared with the industry[6]'s growth of 11.7%. You can

Originally published at ValueWalk[1].Boeing stock is rallying after the company said it sold 75 more 737 MAX jets to 
Ryanair. The aircraft is set to return to regular service by the end of the year, finally bringing an end to a long-
running struggle for Boeing[2].   Q3 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[3] The timing couldn't be better 
because the company is also dealing with the impacts[4] of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led many airlines to 
cancel orders for planes.Boeing sells 737 MAX aircraft to RyanairIn November, the Federal Aviation Administration 
cleared the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to fly again, the company said on Thursday. 
Wasting no time, Boeing has already taken an order for the airplanes from European budget airline Ryanair, 
according to Fox Business[5]. Ryanair placed a 'firm order' for 75 more of the airplanes, which will bring the number 
of 737 MAX jets it operates to 210. The airline initially ordered 100 of the jets with 100 options in 2014 and then 
ordered 10 more in 2017 and an additional 25 the next year. Ryanair said its latest order for 75 Boeing 737 MAX 
aircraft is worth more than $22 billion. Boeing and Ryanair reached an agreement for revised dates of delivery. 
Boeing will also compensate the airline for costs it incurred due to delays in delivery from the previous orders 
because the aircraft[6] were grounded for over a year. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said they expect to receive 
the first 50 Boeing 737 MAX jets next year.Jets returned to serviceBoeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun said in 
a statement that the airplane maker 'remains focused on safely returning the full 737 fleet to service and on 
delivering the backlog of airplanes to Ryanair and our other customers in the new year.' The FAA issued the first 
airworthiness certificate to one of the Boeing 737 MAX jets on Monday, according to Fox News[7]. Boeing plans to 
deliver about half of the aircraft it has in storage by the end of next year. Ryanair ordered the 737 8-200, which has 
more capacity than the 737-8. Boeing has said the airplane allows for more seats and offers better fuel efficiency 
and environmental performance. Ryanair described the airplane as a 'gamechanger.' The airline configured its 737 
jets with 197 seats and plans to use them for low-fare service to new European markets as the COVID-19 vaccine 
becomes available, hopefully returning the travel industry to 'normal.' https://mixi.media/ The post Boeing takes

Dec 04, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Boeing 
Company BA[1] gained about 6% on Dec 3as the low-cost Irish airlineRyanairordered 75 extra Boeing 737 Max 
jets[2] with a value of $9 billion. The news acted as a fresh lifeline to the struggling U.S. planemaker after regulators 
lifted a 20-month safety ban recently.On Nov 18, Boeing won approval from the U.S. Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) to start re-operation of its 737 MAX jet after two fatal crashes (in Indonesia and Ethiopia) that 
caused two years of regulatory scrutiny and corporate chaos.The FAA elaborated software upgrades and training 
changes Boeing must put into effect for the jet to recommence commercial flights after a 20-month grounding[3], the 
longest in commercial aviation history, per Economic Times. The Economic Times article indicated that the single-
aisle jets like the MAX and rival Airbus A320neo are pillars of the global fleet and huge contributors to the global 
industry profit.Ryanairis one of Boeing's most important buyers. Boeing already has an order of 135 of the 197-seat 
Max 200 from Ryanair. 
Ryanair's first jet on order will likely be delivered early next year and the final one by the end of 2024.No wonder, 
the news offered Boeing substantial gains. The airline added about 0.7% after hours on Dec 3. 'This is the 
beginning of the fulfillment of a more robust order book,' Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said at a signing 
event in Washington DC, as quoted on CNBC.To add to this, American Airlines AAL[4] is also 'flying its 
employees[5], including top executives, and reporters on its Boeing 737 Max planes this week' in order to boost 
confidence among the passengers. 'Boeing is also negotiating with airlines includingSouthwestandDeltaandAlaska 
Airlines, which last month agreed to lease 13 Boeing Max jets, industry sources have said,' as quoted on 
CNBC.Against this backdrop, though we believe that the Boeing stock does not offer an aggressive buying 
opportunity even after the FAA approval and Ryanair's order, the hopes of improvement in Boeing business can be 
played via basket approach. The basket approach or the ETF route minimizes the stock-specific risks. Below we 
highlight a few such ETF options. Boeing-Heavy ETFs in Focus iShares U.S. Aerospace &#38; Defense ETF ITA[6]

Dec 03, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair just upped its 
Boeing 737 Max order by 75 aircraft for a total of 210 in a $22 billion order. The Boeing 737 Max 8200, as Ryanair 
calls it, will seat 197 passengers in a high-density configuration ideal for low-cost operations. Deliveries will begin in 
spring 2021 with Ryanair expecting all of the aircraft by 2025. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more 
stories[1].Ireland's Ryanair is the latest carrier to seek out more Boeing 737 Max jets now that the Federal Aviation 
Administration has ended the 20-month grounding and a return to passenger service is in sight.The infamous 
carrier just purchased[2] 75 Boeing 737 Max 8200 aircraft to join its fleet, growing Ryanair's total order to 210 
aircraft to be delivered by 2025. The 8200 variant is Boeing's high-density model of the Max, aimed at ultra-low-cost 
carriers like Ryanair to further maximize the jet's cost-saving economics by filling it with as many passengers as 
possible.Ryanair is known for its tight planes and the Max 8200 will be no different as 197 seats will be jammed into 
the plane that normally seats less than 180. though CEO Michael O'Leary says it will have "more legroom."It's 
essentially the same design as the Max 8 but requires an extra emergency exit door to accommodate the additional 
passengers.As an all-Boeing 737 airline, Ryanair was an early supporter of the 737 Max, placing an order for 100 
aircraft in December 2014[3] and upped its commitment over the years[4]. The March 2019 grounding, however, 
prevented Ryanair from taking delivery of the jets just months before planned with some sitting built and painted at 
Boeing's Washington facilities but undelivered.The Max 8200 aircraft has a current list price of $124.8 million[5] with 
the total order valued at over $22 billion. 
Ryanair confirmed, however, that Boeing knocked the price down due to the grounding and will provide further 
compensation for the inconvenience.Airlines are rushing to get their Max planes back in the air and receive their 
undelivered models to take advantage of the jet's cost savings, especially during the pandemic when every dollar 
counts. Ryanair is already famous for its extremely low fares while still turning a profit and an aircraft like the Max

Dec 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, pilots 
at Delta Air Lines DAL[1] voted in favor of accepting reduced pays in a bid to save their jobs until 2022. Per the Air 
Line Pilots' Association, the union that represents Delta's pilots, the salary-cut plan won 74% pilots' support.JetBlue 
Airways JBLU[2] also grabbed headlines because of its bearish projections for the December quarter due to the 
current booking trends. The carrier believes that the recovery in demand and its revenue rebound will be 'non-linear 
through the fourth quarter and beyond'. Notably, United Airlines UAL[3] too issued a bleak outlook for the final 
quarter of 2020 as was reported in the previous week's write up[4]. Synopsis of the Past Week's Top Stories 1. Per 
aCNBC report[5],Delta's pilots agreed to accept pay cuts to avoid furloughs until 2022. The carrier is making 
consistent efforts to reduce costs as it grapples with coronavirus-induced weak air-travel demand. Per the deal, the 
carrier can trim pilots' guaranteed hours by as much 5%. Additionally, more than 1,700 pilots will get a partial pay of 
30 hours a month even without having to fly. These pilots would have otherwise been furloughed at the end of the 
month without a deal.2. In a SEC filing, JetBlue management stated that it estimates capacity for the fourth quarter 
to decline 45-50% year over year from its previous expectation of a decrease of approximately 45%. The company 
plans to keep managing capacity on a rolling basis so that it is in line with demand. 
Amid volatile booking trends, the carrier predicts revenues to plunge approximately 70% year over year from its 
earlier expectation of a slump of nearly 65%[6].3. Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[7] November traffic tanked 82% year 
over year to 2 million guests as coronavirus keeps air-travel demand suppressed. On a rolling-annual basis, total 
traffic at Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion unit) plummeted 60% to 61.4 million.Additionally, per a Reuters 
report[8], the Irish carrier, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is set to place an order of up to 75 additional 
Boeing 737 MAX jets. Notably, the jets were recently certified to be safe for flying again by the U.S. Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) after being grounded since March 2019.You can seethe complete list of today's 
Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[9]4. Alaska Air Group's ALK[10] subsidiary Alaska Airlines announced 
plans to lease 13 new Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft fromAir Lease CorporationAL[11] as part of its fleet modernization 
efforts. Alaska Airlines will receive deliveries of the 13 737-9 MAX aircraft from fourth-quarter 2021 through 
2022.[12]5 The U.S. Department of Transportation tightened the rule pertaining to passengers travelling with 
service animals on flights[13]. The ruling states that only dogs will qualify as service animals. In a major change, 
animals brought by passengers for emotional support will no longer fall under service animals. This strict ruling may

Nov 19, 2020( Capital Mind: http://www.capitalmind.in Delivered by Newstex)  Global aviation stocks have been 
flying high as positive news of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine fuelled hopes of a rebound in air traffic. Among the top-10 
listed airlines globally, IndiGo is leading the charge as one of two large airlines with higher market cap than this time 
last year. Share prices of InterGlobe Aviation not only touched its 52-week high but is also comfortably trading 
above pre-Covid levels. We took a look to see what it means for current and potential investors.Indigo (Interglobe 
Aviation) stock has gained the most since last year compared to global airlines. 
Indigo is followed by the European low-cost airline Ryanair.The rally in share price is on the back of: peaking of the 
pandemic situation in India, improving trends in daily traffic, market share gains, and positive developments related 
to Covid vaccine However, what investors are overlooking: Air traffic is still less than half of last year, Airfares are 
low, PLFs are still low, Competitive intensity is and will remain high, Covid cases rising at a lower rate, but still 
rising, Cut in corporate travel, and Macro environment remains challengingPeaking PandemicIndia's Covid-19 hit a 
record peak in the middle of September when it reported more than a million active cases. Since then the number of 
daily cases has been steadily declining. A group of India's top scientists believes that the pandemic can be 
controlled by February next year. However, before that, there could be a second wave of infections if caution is 
thrown to the wind during the festival season. All such models assume the obvious: people will wear masks, avoid 
large gatherings, maintain social distancing, and wash hands. The fear of boarding a cylindrical box packed with too 
many people is going to keep peak occupancy away till such time as a vaccine is administered to most of the 
population - which will take time.Daily Air TrafficAccording to the data provided on the DGCA website, air traffic in 
India has been on an increasing trend. The average number of daily passengers flying has jumped nearly three 
times in the last six months. Vaccine HopesIndiGo's share prices joined a global rally as vaccine results fuelled 
optimism of an exit from the pandemic. Indian shares rallied to a record in the ceremonial evening session to mark 
Diwali on the hopes of vaccine and as earnings of some of the country's biggest companies bolstered optimism for 
a faster economic recovery. India's key equity indexes have risen about 10% since last Diwali even as consumption 
was quashed by the world's biggest lockdown, aimed at quelling the virus.Market Share GainsAccording to the data 
from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, there has been some shift in the airline market share in favour of 
IndiGo. This is because smaller players - Vistara, AirAsia, and GoAir - are flying less in an effort to conserve cash. 
Also, there is no pressure from airports for slots utilisation. Overlooked DownsidesThough the air traffic in India is 
rising, it is still half of what it was last year. In November 2020, so far on average, the daily air traffic has been close 
What's the Story with IndiGo Valuations FlyingHigh?
to 1.9 lakh, as compared to 4.3 lakh last year. IndiGo's valuations seem to overlook this fact.The recent rise in air 
traffic could be on the back of low-ticket prices, more capacity being deployed and the onset of the festive season in 
India. Air ticket prices in India over the last two months also reflect the structurally low demand. Ticket prices in 12 
major routes in India have either remained unchanged or have fallen in the last month. Even during the festive 
season, with more people flying, the ticket prices have remained largely unchanged.The growth in air traffic is also 
led by more capacity being deployed. The number of departures per day has increased by 10% in November 
compared to last month, while the average number of fliers per departure has increased by 3%. Compared to June, 
average daily departures have jumped 2.4 times, while fliers per departure have increased by only 1.2 times. This 
growth in air traffic led by more capacity being deployed has largely led to a fall in the passenger load factor - 
capacity utilisation - for airlines in India.Thus, the industry dynamics, have changed from higher and/or stable 
utilisation and ticket prices and growing air traffic, to lower utilisation and ticket prices and growing air traffic. The 
downtrend of two out of three factors, which generally lead to a strong financial performance for an airline, is been 
overlooked by IndiGo's current valuations. At the start of the pandemic, the market was expecting consolidation in 
the aviation industry, due to the weak liquidity conditions of few airlines in India. However, nothing has changed 
even eight months into a pandemic. There has been some shift in market shares but that looks temporary. It seems 
as if IndiGo's investors have placed their bets on the possible benefit to IndiGo from consolidation in the industry. 
Smaller and weaker carriers have sustained the pandemic by implementing stringent cost-saving measures and by 
negotiations with suppliers for a reduction in rentals to preserve liquidity. SpiceJet which seemed to be one of the 
most vulnerable airlines with an anaemic balance sheet has sustained by deferring vendor payments, cutting costs 
and focusing more on its cargo business where demand has been much stronger than usual. Going forward, the 
company is expected to get stronger as 737 Max returns to operations. SpiceJet should start getting incentives for 
every aircraft as part of the sales and leaseback agreement of its 737 Max aircraft order. With potential 
compensation from Boeing and cash incentives with every aircraft, the company might get the required liquidity to 
stay afloat and to improve its balance sheet. The return of 737 Max would also improve its cost structure. Among 
the other players, GoAir with its new leadership team is striving hard to get its pre-covid level of market share. The 
company has been able to grow its market share from 3.8% to 6.7% as of September.The Air India Stake SaleAir 
India on the other hand, has been running its operations smoothly with a 10% domestic market share, even as the 
Government of India is struggling to find a buyer for the same. A successful sale would turn fat into muscle, 
increasing competition for incumbents, while a 'no-sale' is most likely to mean continued government support, in line 
with other loss-making PSUs. The government has been trying to sell Air India for the past few years. Previously, 
when the government tried to sell Air India, the terms and the shape in which the government wanted to sell Air 
India were not sufficiently attractive to any of the potential buyers. Hence the government has sweetened the deal 
this time and has decided to be more flexible with the terms.Tata Group partially owns and runs two airlines - 
AirAsia and Vistara - in India. Both these airlines have been able to regain most of their market share. The 
Malaysian promoter of AirAsia has indicated that it could exit India owing to financial distress. However, the Tata 
Group is in discussions to buy the stake. On the other hand, Vistara - which is jointly owned by Tata and Singapore 
Airlines - is looking to expand its operations by possibly acquiring Air India, according to media reports. This 
indicates that the consolidation event in the Indian aviation industry is unlikely. In fact the competitive intensity could 
rise if demand growth continues to lag the supply growth. Again, the valuations of IndiGo seem to overlook this 
concern.Risks to this ValuationCovid-19 in India might have peaked, and the number of daily cases has been 
declining steadily, but the total number of cases and deaths have still been rising. This has restricted flyers from 
flying. Moreover, with the ongoing festive season, the number of infections could well rise to go ahead. Kerala, for 
instance, recorded a sharp uptick in cases in September following celebrations of Onam, a harvest festival. Delhi 
has been witnessing a sudden spike in coronavirus disease cases since October 28 due to the festive season, the 
opening of essential services, and allowing the movement of people. This phenomenon, if witnessed across 
different states, could push the Indian Government towards a second lockdown. Even globally, many nations have 
announced a second lockdown as a new wave of infections sweeps through their nations. This means that the 
uncertainty around normalcy of international travel still persists. Along with this, commentary from corporates 
suggests that travel is one of the cost lines that may get cut on a sustainable basis. This implies that business travel 
- half of the total domestic travel - may take much longer to recover. Thus, the continued rise in Covid-19 cases 
makes it difficult to pinpoint when normalcy would return. And these concerns to have been ignored by IndiGo's 
current valuations.There is no doubt that IndiGo is a well-run business and is one of the best-placed airlines in 
India. It has a 50%+ market share and a strong balance sheet. However, the question is does the fundamentals and 
What's the Story with IndiGo Valuations FlyingHigh?
the current challenging macro environment justify such expensive valuations. The overall liquidity rush has driven 
up the share prices, but the fact remains the same that at current levels the stock is expensive as the path forward 
doesn't look so smooth. As such, investors would do well to exercise some caution.This article is for information

Nov 18, 2020( Alaska Dispatch: http://www.adn.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The first to fly will be American 
Airlines, which has scheduled a Max round-trip flight from Miami to New York's La Guardia airport for Dec. 29. 
According to an internal memo sent Sunday to Alaska Airlines pilots, the Seattle-based carrier plans to take its first 
737-9 Max delivery early next year and start flying it in service by the end of March. United Airlines expects to 
schedule flights on the Max in late January or February. 
Southwest Air, which has decided to take the time to put all of its 9,000 pilots through Max training before any of 
them fly passengers, said it likely won't put the Max on its schedule before April. Following the Federal Aviation 
Administration's lead, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) along with Transport Canada and 
Brazilian air safety regulator ANAC are also expected to clear the Max to fly by year end. That will pave the way for 
Ireland's Ryanair to start taking Max deliveries and for Air Canada and Calgary-based WestJet to begin flying the 
three dozen grounded Maxs already delivered into Canada. Before American flies passengers on the Max in late 
December, it has plans to try to reassure the public that the plane is safe. The airline will take employees and the 
press on demonstration flights out of Dallas. And it will invite corporate customers to tour the Max on the ground in 
Dallas, Miami and New York, where they can ask questions of pilots who will fly the plane. Southwest doesn't plan 
demo flights but said it will conduct 'readiness flights' on each aircraft before returning the Max fleet to scheduled 
service. And CEO Gary Kelly indicated he will likely fly on a Max before passengers do so. Though Boeing and 
some airlines have begun avoiding use of the now-tainted Max brand name, instead referring only to the 737-8 or 
737-9 models, all the U.S. carriers say they will make it transparent to travelers what plane they are flying on. All 
three U.S. airlines that were operating the Max before the grounding— American, United and Southwest — said 
they will rebook free of charge any passengers who balk at flying on a Max. American spokesperson Sarah Jantz 
said if a Max is switched onto a flight previously scheduled to be flown by some other plane, the airline will let 
passengers know via email, text and push notifications. 'If a customer doesn't want to fly on a 737 Max aircraft, they 
won't have to,' she said. 'We'll provide flexibility to ensure our customers can be easily re-accommodated if they 
prefer not to fly on one.' If a reluctant passenger doesn't want to re-book, the airlines will offer either refunds or 
vouchers for future travel depending on the type of ticket. Despite the downturn in demand, American, Southwest, 
United and Alaska are all keen to fly the Max so they can swap out older aircraft to eke out whatever savings they 
can from the jet's fuel efficiency advantage — the 737 Max burns 14% less fuel than the previous model 737 NG. 
When air traffic eventually recovers, airlines will also use the Max's longer range to open up new long-distance 
Related:Airlines offer reassurances about the 737 Max — and flexibility for travelers who don't want to board 
one
routes. For example, when United first started flying the Max, it flew the plane between Houston, Texas, and 
Anchorage, Alaska, a route too long for the 737 NG. 'The longer range and better fuel efficiency of the Max creates 
new options for flying a greater number of seats between more city pairs,' said a person familiar with United's plans. 
It's likely United will focus Max flights out of its hubs in Houston and Denver. Some international customers are also 
eager to get the Max. Low-cost carrier Ryanair is aggressively seeking to increase market share in Europe while 
rival airlines contract, and is negotiating a possible additional Max order in exchange for a large discount. Eddie 
Wilson, CEO of the main Dublin-based unit of Ryanair, speaking this month at a virtual webinar hosted by Australia-
based CAPA — Centre for Aviation, said the low-cost carrier wants to have up to 30 Maxs by next summer and has 
simulators and pilots ready for training. 'We've got to get this aircraft,' Wilson said. 'It's a fantastic aircraft. It's 
probably going to be the aircraft that has got the most scrutiny from safety regulators. And we are really looking 
forward to having it in our fleet.' The FAA's green light for the Max to return to service is the signal for a frantic 
period of aircraft modification and maintenance, as well as simultaneous intensive pilot training, before the plane 
can actually fly passengers. All of the U.S. airlines that will operate the Max will soon commence the new pilot 
training mandated by the FAA. That consists of approximately five hours' training in total: two hours of computer 
based training followed by a one-hour briefing to prepare for a two-hour session in a full-flight simulator handling the 
flight controls in various scenarios. Southwest has installed and certified nine 737 Max simulators to conduct the 
flight training with its 9,000 pilots. American and United will introduce Max flights on a rolling basis as teams of 
pilots come out of training. Boeing faces its own stiff challenge to get roughly 450 as-yet-undelivered Maxs out of 
mothballs and ready for customers. With many orders canceled, it must also find a new customer for more than 60 
of those jets. In addition, it will have to be deeply involved with the airlines that have the 385 Maxs that were in 
service before the jet was grounded. As foreign regulators follow the FAA in clearing the Max to fly, Boeing will set 
up airplane modification lines in various parts of the world to train the teams of mechanics that will do the work for 
each airline.

Easyjet drops to 1.3bn loss as air travel collapses

https://bmmagazine.co.uk/news/easyjet-drops-to-1-3bn-loss-as-air-travel-collapses/Easyjet has plunged to losses of 
nearly 1.3 billion and conceded that even while it has cut services by 80 per cent going into the winter that flight 
plan is aimed at only reducing further expected losses.Despite the biggest loss in its 25-year history and a several 
months more yet of uncertainty, Johan Lundgren, the airline's chief executive, insisted: 'Easyjet has not only 
withstood the impact of the pandemic but now has an unparalleled foundation upon which to emerge strongly from 
the crisis.' With the short-haul, pan-European operator having already warned of the extent of its losses, Easyjet 
shares rose 2p to 779p. Prior to the pandemic outbreak, the shares were trading at above 15. Filings for the year to 
the end of September show Easyjet racked up losses from operations of 835 million before a further 438 million of 
one-off items took the total losses to 1.273 billion. 
In the airline industry's crucial spring and summer seasons which started with fleets grounded by the outbreak of 
Covid-19 and ended with the sector deeply troubled by incoherent travel and quarantine restrictions, Easyjet made 
underlying losses of 642 million. That is nearly four times the losses posted by its great rival Ryanair which reported 
losses of 172 million between April and September. The losses came after the pandemic halved Easyjet's 
passenger numbers in the 12 months to 48 million. With the fares it was able to charge passengers being cut by 
more than 10 per cent, revenues plunged by 53 per cent to 3 billion. Without the impact of the pandemic, Easyjet 
could have expected its 335-strong fleet of short-haul aircraft to carry about 100 million passengers. In the UK it has 
been the largest operator at three of the country's top five busiest airports — Gatwick, Manchester and Luton. It is 
33 per cent controlled by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, its founder, who has spent much of the last decade since he left 
the board waging war against the company's directors. The airline's losses include 123 million covering the 
redundancies of 4,500 or 30 per cent of its workforce, working out at average pay-offs of about 27,000 apiece. 
There is a 311 million charge for future losses on the unwinding of its foreign exchange and jet fuel contracts and 
75 million of losses on the sale and leaseback of aircraft and the value of leased planes. Despite the months of 
uncertainty to come, the prospect of Covid-19 vaccines and more coherent testing programmes for air travel led Mr 
Lundgren to insist that the 3.1 billion of cash it has borrowed or raised will see it through the crisis. In a statement, 
the airline said: 'Based on current travel restrictions in the markets in which we operate, Easyjet expects to fly no 
more than circa 20 per cent of planned capacity for [the October-December] quarter. We remain focused on cash 
generative flying over the winter season in order to minimise losses during the first half [to the end of March]. 'We 
Easyjet drops to 1.3bn loss as air travel collapses
retain the flexibility to rapidly ramp up capacity when we see demand return. At this stage, given the continued level 
of short-term uncertainty, it would not be appropriate to provide any further financial guidance for the 2021 financial 
year.'

expects 
air passenger numbers to bounce back to near normal levels by next summer, defying industry predictions that it 
could take years for growth to return after the pandemic.The airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said 
passenger volumes should reach 75-80% of pre-Covid levels in 2021, especially if a vaccine was developed by the 
spring. While he admitted winter was a 'write-off', he claimed Ryanair was poised 'at the dawn of an extraordinary 
era of growth' with a fleet of new planes arriving, and was emerging from the pandemic with a strong balance sheet, 
in a position to offer low fares to stimulate travel. 
Speaking at the World Travel Market conference, O'Leary said he was optimistic that Covid vaccines would be 
rolled out before the peak summer season in 2021. 'There's going to be an enormous snapback on travel demand 
Mrs O'Leary is very keen to go back to the Algarve and I suspect she'd be there in 2.5 nanoseconds after the 
coronavirus restrictions are lifted. I think she's reflective of the overwhelming majority of Europe's population, and 
they will go back,' O'Leary said. 'We're going to see a surge of that intra-European tourism next year, and we need 
to be there to provide the capacity at low prices.' Ryanair has cut capacity for winter, but not yet as drastically as its 
rival easyJet. O'Leary added: 'I've heard a lot of rubbish coming from legacy airlines that it'll be 2035 till the volumes 
come back. Rubbish. Volumes will go back in 2021 or 2022 pretty quickly - they will go back because Ryanair will 
discount prices, hotels will discount.' The travel industry organisation Abta said some firms had reported bookings 
for next summer since the announcement of a vaccine by Pfizer on Monday, while more were receiving inquiries 
from would-be holidaymakers. TravelSupermarket said 54% more people had searched for holidays in the 24 hours 
since the vaccine news, compared with the previous Monday. On the Beach, which organises about 1.5m package 
holidays a year, said online traffic had jumped 25% but there had not yet been a notable impact on bookings. An 
Abta spokeswoman said the vaccine news would 'go some way to restoring consumer confidence' but the industry 
needed government support now 'as many travel companies will not be able to wait for the full rollout of a vaccine'. 
O'Leary criticised government 'incompetence', particularly in the UK but across Europe, in addressing the 
pandemic. He said: 'What was disturbing is the way the government mishandled that first lockdown it should have 
given time to put in place mass testing.' He said Boris Johnson's promise of a world-class test-and-trace system 
had been 'utter vacuous rubbish', and questioned the approach now being taken by the UK government's global 
taskforce in developing a new testing regime for arrivals. 'Airport testing is a complete waste of time it's too late, it 
Ryanair expects air passenger numbers to bounce back in 2021
takes too long, what do you do in a terminal when you have positive tests?' Ryanair supported pre-departure 
testing, O'Leary said, to restart flying. 'Testing should not be at airports, people should be coming to airports with a 
negative test Certainly within Europe, short-haul should be restarting quickly.' O'Leary said he had been busy 
negotiating new airport slots around Europe for after the pandemic. 'Airports are realising that a lot of Lufthansa's 
capacity is not coming back they want to deal with an airline that is rapid and flexible. What we've done is been 
keeping all our planes, pilots and crew current, so we can pounce on growth.' Ryanair's fleet should be augmented 
by the first deliveries of Boeing 737 Max planes, O'Leary said, anticipating European regulatory approval of the 
model in January. He dismissed concerns over the safety of the plane, which was grounded after two fatal crashes. 
'It will be the most audited, the most interrogated, safest aircraft ever to fly.' Read more: Ryanair expects air

have 
upgraded Britain's growth forecasts amid hopes that Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine will end the health restrictions that 
have hammered businesses and the economy this year.GDP may return to pre-pandemic levels as soon as the 
middle of next year as life gets back to normal faster than many forecasters had dared predict. Those that produced 
a range of scenarios said that their 'upside' projections now appeared more likely. 
Capital Economics said that unemployment was likely to peak 'at 7 per cent next year instead of 9 per cent' and that 
GDP may 'rise to its pre-virus level a year earlier than otherwise . . . early in 2022 rather than 2023'. Douglas 
McWilliams, chairman of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said that GDP growth next year 'might 
be double-digit or close to that' and may have recovered all the lost ground since March possibly 'as early as mid-
2021'. Simon French, UK economist at Panmure Gordon, said: 'This would bring forward the period for return to 
pre-Covid levels of output to the first half of 2022, from the first half of 2023.' Even economists who decided not to 
change their forecasts said that the vaccine presented 'upside risks' to their projections. Oxford Economics is 
forecasting growth of 5.4 per cent next year in its 'baseline' scenario, but 8.9 per cent in its 'upside' one. Andrew 
Goodwin, UK economist at the consultancy, said that the vaccine 'changes the skew of the risk profile, placing a 
higher probability on our upside scenario'. Last week the Bank of England downgraded its 2020 forecast from a 
contraction of 9.5 per cent to a contraction of 11 per cent and for the recovery next year to be slower, with growth of 
7.25 per cent rather than 9 per cent. It expected the lost ground since March to have been recovered by early 2022. 
The Bank did not base its models on a vaccine being discovered and few economists imputed a growth path based 
on a miracle drug. George Buckley, UK economist at Nomura, said: 'It's certainly very encouraging news so could 
present upside risks to our view. The vaccine means there's now a greater chance of a 'step adjustment'.' A vaccine 
raises the possibility of life returning to normal[1], encouraging people back into the shops and on to aircraft. 
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, the low-cost airline, said that it was the 'first bit of sunshine we've had 
for the past 12 months'. He forecast a return to 75 per cent to 80 per cent of pre-crisis traffic by next summer, an 
improvement on the 50 per cent to 80 per cent range he had given eight days earlier. 'There's reasonable optimism 
now that summer 2021 will get back to some degree of normality,' he told an online conference a day after Pfizer 
said that its experimental vaccine was 90 per cent effective in trials. Read more: Economy will have recovered from

Nov 10, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate Release 
Chicago, IL - November 10, 2020 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day 
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. 
Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL[1], United Airlines Holdings, Inc. 
UAL[2], American Airlines Group Inc. AAL[3], Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[4] and Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[5]. 
Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Coronavirus Ruins Airlines' Q3 Earnings, As Well Airline stocks 
have been in the pink of health over the past few years, mainly on the back of solid passenger revenues owing to 
robust air-travel demand. However, with the advent of coronavirus in the first quarter of 2020, things deteriorated for 
the entire aviation space as travel demand plummeted with people being confined to their homes in the fear of the 
contagion.What is worse is that the health peril is still very much around even though more than seven months have 
elapsed since the disease was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Consequently, airlines 
continue to bear the brunt of this global adversity. As an evidence, airlines fared dismally for the third successive 
quarter this year with losses mounting due to crippled passenger revenues.Against this bleak backdrop, let's 
recapitulate the results of a few key airline stocks for the September quarter.Delta Air Lineskicked off the third-
quarter 2020 earnings season for the aviation industry on Oct 13. This Atlanta-GA based company incurred a loss 
(excluding $5.17 from non-recurring items) of $3.30 per share in the September quarter, wider than the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of a loss of $3.14. Also, passenger revenues plunged 83% year over year in the September 
quarter. In fact, due to low demand, this key metric declined 68% in the first nine months of 2020.Akin to Delta, 
Chicago-basedUnited Airlinessuffered a loss in the third successive quarter of 2020. The carrier reported a loss 
(excluding $1.83 from non-recurring items) of $8.16 per share in the September quarter, comparing unfavorably 
with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $7.63. Passenger revenues plunged 84.3% and 68.4% in the third 
quarter and during the first nine months of 2020, respectively.American Airlinesposted a loss (excluding 83 cents 
from non-recurring items) of $5.54 per share for third-quarter 2020, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
a loss of $5.62. Passenger revenues plunged 76.9% and 64.2% in the third quarter and during the first nine months 
of 2020, respectively.Dallas-based low-cost carrierSouthwest Airlinesfared no better and announced a loss for the 
third consecutive quarter like its fellow airline players mentioned above. The carrier, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Delta Air Lines , United Airlines , American Airlines , Southwest Airlines and 
Ryanair Holdings
(Hold) currently, incurred a loss of $1.99 per share (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring items) in the reported 
quarter, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $2.44. Moreover, passenger revenues plunged 
71.2% and 61.2% in the third quarter and during the first nine months of 2020, respectively.You can see the 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[6] Any Respite Ahead? With airlines having 
performed disappointingly in the third quarter, echoing the first two quarters' trend, the million-dollar question is 
whether things will look up for the stocks from hereon. Unfortunately, the answer is a big no at least for the near 
term. Notably, Delta's president Glen Hauenstein warned that 'it may be two years or more' for the revenue stream 
to normalize.Even though air-travel demand showed signs of marginal recovery, particularly, on the leisure front, 
the spike in the coronavirus cases all across Europe (resulting in renewed lockdowns in many countries) and the 
same in some parts of the United States induce fears that the surge in cases might offset the improvement in travel 
frequency. Notably, European carrierRyanair Holdingsforecasts losses to worsen in the second half of fiscal 2021 
(ending Mar 31, 2021) from the first.Additionally, the expiry of the CARES Act on Sep 30 forced carriers like 
American Airlines and United Airlines to shrink their respective workforces in the face of dwindling air-travel 
demand. Despite some positive developments, a second round of financial aid from the government has not 
materialized yet, thereby making the job cuts necessary.However, on a brighter note we expect focus to shift to a 
second round of federal stimulus once Biden is officially declared as the next US president. The positive vibes on 
the package, which came from various quarters prior to the elections, might see a further impetus leading to the 
much-anticipated sop eventually seeing the light of the day.In the event of a further federal stimulus, the bruised 
and the battered U.S. airline stocks would surely get some relief as the pandemic grant will protect jobs in the near 
term and keep hopes afloat amid the existing unprecedented crisis. Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit

has banned travel from Denmark after the Danish government revealed it found a potentially dangerous coronavirus 
mutation[1]. Denmark said earlier this week that it will slaughter 17 million minks from its fur farms after discovering 
that the coronavirus had mutated inside the animals and infected at least 12 people. Some scientists say the 
mutation has pandemic potential[2], while others call for calm because too little is known about the mutated 
coronavirus strain.The Danish government announced earlier this week plans to cull up to 17 million minks[3] from 
its fur farms and isolate one region of the country. Researchers discovered that the novel coronavirus had infected 
the animals and suffered a dangerous mutation that might render the current generation of vaccines useless. 
Some of the scientists involved with the matter warned that the mutation is a serious cause of concern and might 
lead to another pandemic. Others called for calm, saying it's too early for panic[4] because more research is 
required. Danish scientists have started sharing genomic sequences of the new coronavirus mutation, and 
international researchers will soon study the new strain. The UK government has taken the risk very seriously and 
decided to ban Denmark visitors from entering Great Britain. The decision will be reevaluated as the situation 
progresses. The UK transport secretary announced the decision shortly after 02:00 GMT, less than two hours 
before they took effect, according to BBC News[5]. UK citizens returning from Denmark will have to isolate along 
with all family members for 14 days. The move also applies to cabin crew flying back and forth between the two 
countries. The only exception applies to freight and haulers. Ryanair, one of the biggest low-cost airlines in the 
region, criticized the decision by calling it 'bizarre and baseless.' The airline still has to comply, so it canceled all 
flights to and from Denmark.DENMARK update: From 4am on 7 November, British Nationals or residents who are 
returning to the UK directly or indirectly from Denmark will need to self-isolate with other members of their 
household until two weeks have passed since they were last in Denmark. — Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP 
(@grantshapps) November 7, 2020[6] 'This decision to act quickly follows on from health authorities in Denmark 
reporting widespread outbreaks of coronavirus in mink farms,' transport secretary Grant Shapps said on Twitter. 
'Keeping the UK public safe remains our top priority.' The travel ban will be reviewed after a week, according to the 
Department for Transport (DfT). Denmark's Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod said the ban was a 'very drastic 
step.' He added that the Danish authorities were working closely with international health organizations on the 
matter. UK officials will seek out anyone who traveled to Denmark in the last couple of weeks and advise them to 
Countries are now trying to contain a coronavirus mutation that could spark another pandemic
self-isolate. Authorities in Denmark said a few days ago[7] that some 12 people are known to have been infected 
with the mutated coronavirus. But the BBC now says that 200 people have been infected with strains related to 
mink. The mutations impact the virus's spike protein, which is the coronavirus component that allows the virus to 
latch onto healthy cells. Most vaccines target the spike protein to block this specific process. Denmark has 
announced that a lockdown will be introduced in some areas because of the mutation. Most of the infections are 
connected to farms in Denmark's North Jutland region. Of note, the World Health Organization said it's too early to 
jump to conclusions.  Chris Smith started writing about gadgets as a hobby, and before he knew it he was sharing 
his views on tech stuff with readers around the world. Whenever he's not writing about gadgets he miserably fails to 
stay away from them, although he desperately tries. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. [ 1]: https://bgr.com

View original post here[2]. Biden in, COVID out.  Global stocks and S&#38;P futures exploded higher, hitting all time 
highs, following this morning's news that a Pfizer covid vaccine [3]is more than 90% effective, which came at a time 
when stocks were already euphoric in the overnight session following the weekend's political news that Biden was 
in.  The result, in a nutshell, was an explosion in small caps, a surge in the Dow, a spike in the S&#38;P and a 
slump in the Nasdaq (more below).    "This is about the best the news could possibly be for the world and for 
theUnited Statesand for public health," said William Gruber, Pfizer senior vice president for vaccine clinical research 
and development. It was better than even the best result he had hoped for, he said. 
 The news, which conveniently came just days after Biden was declared president elect by the media, sent Emini 
S&#38;P futures up as much as 4%, last seen up 124 points to 3,634 or up 3.8%    and hitting new all time highs, 
surpassing the early September closing record of 3,568.    pushing European stocks up 3.9%, led by travel, banks, 
energy and auto sectors    and Dow futures up 5%, or more than 1,400 points, to 29,650    the ETF of Russell 2000 
ETF small-caps, the RTY, just hit the 7% limit up.    With the Pfizer news unleashing an epic reflation trade, the 
Nasdaq initially rose but then tumbled on the back of the sharply higher yields which are hitting deflation names 
such as the FAAMGs    triggering an impressive reversal in the S&#38;P/Nasdaq relationship:    "For stocks, this is 
likely the best of both worlds," saidJoyce Chang, head of global research at JPMorgan Securities. "A GOP senate 
majority should ensure that Trump's pro-business policies stay intact. Under Biden, additional tariffs that fueled the 
trade war are unlikely to materialize."  Stocks that had struggled due to lock-down/restrictive measures related to 
the virus soared; cruise operators, airlines, hotels, amusement park/movie theater operators and casinos were 
among the early session's top 'lock- down' performers.  Airline stocks surged, with the Stoxx 600 Travel &#38; 
Leisure Index up as much as 7%, the most intraday since May 26, with the index reaching the highest since Match 
9; British Airways parent IAG jumped 25%, cruise operator Carnival surged 18%, Ryanair gained 18% and hotel 
company Accor jumps 12%. U.S. airlines also jumped premarket, with American Airlines up 15% and Delta up 12%.  
Catering companies like Sodexo and Compass, travel booking software firm Amadeus also surging, as are airports 
concession operators like WH Smith, SSP Group and Autogrill. Aerospace stocks are also surging, with Airbus, 
Safran and Rolls-Royce among the biggest gainers in the industrial goods index, along with airports operators like 
ADP and Aena.  Bank stocks also jumped in premarket trading: BofA, Citigroup and JPMorgan climbed about 7% 
S&P Futures, Global Stocks Soar To All Time High, Russell Limit Up On Covid Vaccine News
while Wells Fargo jumped more than 8%; Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs rose more than 5% as the yield 
curve sharply steepened. Regional banks rallied, too with KeyCorp, Huntington, Regions and Truist rising more 
than 5%.  Banks had been hard hit this year by pandemic-induced economic woes and low interest rates; the KBW 
Bank Index (BKX) has tumbled 31% versus an 8.6% gain for the S&#38;P 500. Card stocks gained as well, with 
Visa and Mastercard adding more than 5%, and American Express and Capital One up more than 8%.  At the same 
time, stay at home stocks such as Peloton, Netflix and Zoom sank: PTON is down 5.2%, NFLX -3.3% and ZM -5%; 
Nautilus, Etsy and Wayfair also fell. The news also hammered companies that had boomed amid an insatiable need 
for Covid-19 tests: QDEL sank 14% as QGEN tumbled 12%; among smaller companies trading on lighter volumer 
were GNMK -6.1%, FLDM -2.8%.  Looking ahead, Bloomberg notes that there's precedence for the market's gains 
to continue. Since 2000, every time the S&#38;P 500 was higher heading into Election Day, November and 
December came in green, too. The first years of presidential terms have also been good ones of late. Since 1986, 
according to Leuthold Group data, they've seen average gains of 18.6%.  The news also helped crude oil explode 
8% higher    while such flight to safety trades as Treasury yields, reversed amid expectations the reflation trade may 
finally be unleashed should covid be vanquished, and the 10Y yield soared as much as 14bps higher, rising to a 
session high of 0.9338% before easing back to 0.91%. Supply is also a factor as this week's Treasury refunding 
begins with 3-year note sale at 1pm ET and a heavy IG corporate issuance slate is expected.    Others safety 
trades such as gold and silver, were also hammered, tumbling over 2%.    In FX, the USD was little changed 
overall, though the underlying bias was negative according to BMO's Stephen Gallo; in BBDXY terms the currency 
is down 2.4% in Q4 to-date. Within the FX space, the bulk of the weakness in the USD was shouldered by the 
currencies of commodity exporters (NZD, AUD, NOK, CAD, IDR and MXN). Risk assets fed off the strength in 
commodity prices and weaker USD (Hang Seng +1.2%, Stoxx-50 +6.0%), and the rally gained momentum after 
reports of an effective vaccine circulated.  Elsewhere in FX, the TRY rallied 6.1% vs the USD after leadership 
changes were announced for Turkey's MoF and central bank over the weekend. The majority of FX investors 
probably expect CBRT to tighten its monetary policy stance further to rein in credit growth, although that is clearly at 
odds with Erdogan's ideological preference for rate cuts. Despite that sentiment, the yield on the local currency 2-
year government debt dropped (probably because financial markets had already been applying the tightening for 
the central bank). The next scheduled rate decision is on November 19.  Looking ahead, here are some of the 
week's key events:  Brexit trade-deal talks between the U.K. and EU continue in London Monday  Tuesday is the 
EU's target date for triggering tariffs on as much as $4 billion of U.S. goods in retaliation over illegal aid to Boeing 
Co.  Alibaba holds its annual Singles' Day on Wednesday, an online global shopping phenomenon that had $38 
billion of sales last year  ECB President Christine Lagarde, BOE Governor Andrew Bailey and Fed Chair Jerome 
Powell are among the speakers Thursday at an online ECB Forum entitled 'Central Banks in a Shifting World'  
Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 hold an extraordinary meeting Friday to discuss bolder 
action to help poor nations struggling to repay their debts.  Aside for the Pfizer covid vaccine, here are some of the 
other top overnight news from Bloomberg:  Biden is largely ignoring Trump's efforts to undermine his victory. The 
president-elect plans to unveil on Monday his transition team's coronavirus task force, a step toward fulfilling his 
central campaign promise: He will make containing the pandemic his first priority  Republican congressional leaders 
still wary of crossing President Donald Trump are holding back from acknowledging Democrat Joe Biden's victory in 
the 2020 presidential race  Joe Biden won the presidency promising to bring Americans together. But now his 
administration is sure to come under pressure from some Democrats to risk exacerbating divisions by investigating 
and prosecuting Donald Trump  Germany is seeking to mend transatlantic trade relations and is mulling a more 
conciliatory approach that would see the European Union delay tariffs set to hit $4 billion of American products as 
soon as Tuesday, according to a senior official familiar with the government's thinking  Unlike Donald Trump, whom 
Chinese officials had little knowledge of before he took office, Joe Biden is well known in Beijing. But that history is 
unlikely to quickly repair a relationship between the global powers that has fundamentally changed over the past 
four years  France's economy will take a smaller hit from the new lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 than it 
did during the tighter restrictions on activity earlier this year, according to the country's central bank  Over the 
course of the next seven days, the U.K. premier needs to deliver a trade deal with the EU or risk a chaotic and 
economically damaging rupture, and avoid a rift with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden over the U.K.'s controversial 
Brexit laws  While it's already somewhat dated, here is DB's Jim Reid with a recap of the weekend's firehose of 
news:  So barring an extraordinary series of events Joe Biden will be the next President of the US. Not that it 
matters in the great scheme of things but we've been debating whether this was a close election or not. It really 
depends on how you look at it. In terms of the popular vote, Joe Biden won more votes than any candidate in 
S&P Futures, Global Stocks Soar To All Time High, Russell Limit Up On Covid Vaccine News
history and will likely win by the second most decisive result since 2000. He leads by 3pp currently with this likely to 
grow in the coming days, with Nate Silver predicting 4.3pp over the weekend. However in the end the election could 
have been tied at 269 (and a Congress likely to be weighted towards anointing Trump) without a combined c.55,000 
votes in Arizona, Wisconsin and Georgia. It's largely irrelevant but interesting nevertheless.  Attention will still 
remain on the remaining Senate races. The Democrats have gained a net of one seat so far, and it looks likely that 
a pair of run-off elections in Georgia on January 5th will determine which party controls the Senate over the next 
two years. The most likely outcome though is a divided government as the Dems would need to win both against 
current expectations.  The market last week stuck to the normal script post a close election where the market rallies 
regardless of who wins rather than one where micro analysis of post election policies are used to predict what 
happens next. Who needs us analysts?  The S&#38;P 500 rallied +7.32% last week (-0.03% Friday), while the VIX 
fell -13.2pts to 24.9, its lowest level since August. It was the S&#38;P's best week since early April when the index 
was coming back from the pandemic lows. Indeed it was the best post election 2-day performance since 1900 
according to DB's Binky Chadha.  Binky also noted that going into the election, near term implied vol across asset 
classes had risen sharply and vol curves were steeply inverted. As the election unfolded in a largely orderly fashion, 
vol collapsed, with vol curves now significantly flatter across the board. The drop in implied vol has been entirely 
driven by a fall in risk premiums, with realised vol in fact rising. The equity vol premium is now in the middle of its 
historical range, according to Binky suggesting the unwinding of protection positions is done.  However, the bounce 
in the S&#38;P 500 took it only to the top of the range it has been in since August so you could argue we've just 
returned back to where we were before election risk premiums started rising. Technology and Biotech stocks 
outperformed last week with the NASDAQ up a greater +9.01% (+0.04% Friday). The positive risk sentiment was 
seen in Europe as well, as the Stoxx 600 ended the week +7.02% higher (-0.20% Friday) while the FTSE MIB 
(+9.69%), CAC 40 (+7.98%), and DAX (+7.99%) all gained sharply.  In terms of the economic outlook post election 
our US economists updated their view on Friday. Since Election Day, Senate Majority Leader McConnell has 
sounded more open to a stimulus deal. This shift in tone increases the chances for a lame duck package and could 
hint at the potential for a somewhat larger stimulus deal than they originally thought without a 'Blue Wave'. So they 
keep their current baseline assumption of a roughly $750bn fiscal package legislated by Q1 even though they 
previously worried about this in a split government scenario.  Although the pace of the economic recovery entering 
Q4 has exceeded their prior expectations, worsening covid trends continue to be a source of downside risk in the 
coming months. Balancing out these risks, they have upgraded their Q4 real GDP growth projection by 120bps to 
2.3% (annualised). This is mainly due to a 170bps upward revision to consumer spending, which we now see 
expanding by 1.6% in the current quarter. The upshot is that 2020 growth has been revised up by 30bps to -2.9% 
on a Q4/Q4 basis. They have not made any material changes to their 2021 and 2022 growth projections. However, 
given the importance of the Senate outcome, they plan to reassess their view pending the results of those elections 
in early January. See their note here for more.  Asian markets have started the week on a front foot with the Nikkei 
(+2.41%), Hang Seng ( +1.77%), Shanghai Comp (+1.95% ) and Kospi ( +1.41%) all advancing. Futures on the 
S&#38;P 500 and Nasdaq are also up as much as +1.70% and +2.60% respectively on the news of a Biden 
Presidency. In FX, the onshore Chinese yuan is up +0.54% to 6.5771. The Turkish lira is also up +1.56% this 
morning after a new central bank chief was appointed over the weekend and the subsequent resignation of the 
country's finance and treasury minister, Berat Albayrak. Elsewhere, crude oil prices are up c. +2.50% while spot 
gold prices are up +0.70%. In terms of weekend data releases, we saw China's October exports at 11.4% yoy (vs. 
9.2% yoy expected), the highest growth since March 2019 while, imports stood at +4.7% yoy (vs. +8.6% yoy 
expected).  Onto the latest on the virus and the US reported another 102,342 cases over the past 24 hours, 
marking the 5th continuous day over 100k. The state of Utah is now facing an overcrowding of hospitals and has 
declared a state of emergency and ordered a mask mandate. The state has also ordered 2-week restrictions on 
casual social gatherings and extracurricular activities. Meanwhile in Oklahoma, more than 90% of ICU beds are 
now occupied and the state's health commissioner has asked residents to wear masks and observe other 
precautions. President Elect Joe Biden will speak later today on his plan to 'beat Covid 19,' under which he is 
expected to appoint a 12-member coronavirus task force. In Europe, Italy reported over 30k for the 5th consecutive 
day yesterday. For more on how the virus is spreading see the table below.  Maybe as US election noise begins to 
fade we'll return back to the virus and to what promises to be a crucial week for Brexit trade negotiations although 
one can be accused of crying wolf so many times before on this sort of statement that markets won't really pay it 
too much attention. However to ratify any deal across Europe before December 31st, mid-November has often 
been cited as the last point where a deal can be struck. Deadlines have been extended before but the next week 
S&P Futures, Global Stocks Soar To All Time High, Russell Limit Up On Covid Vaccine News
takes us to that point. A call between PM Johnson and the EU's Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday suggested 
progress had been made but that there were still issues around the level playing field and fishing. The PM noting 
'significant differences' remain and von der Leyen suggesting 'large differences'. Talks will continue this week.  On 
the data front, this week is a quieter one, with the highlights including the US CPI reading for October on Thursday, 
along with the preliminary consumer sentiment index from the University of Michigan for November. The UK will 
also be releasing its Q3 GDP reading, although for Q4 the Bank of England is now predicting another contraction 
with England now experiencing a second lockdown.  Finally, earnings season is winding down now, with 438 of the 
S&#38;P 500 companies having now reported. We will only see a further 16 S&#38;P 500 companies report this 
week, along with a further 65 from the STOXX 600. In terms of the highlights, today we'll hear from McDonald's, 
before tomorrow sees reports from Adidas and Deutsche Post. Then on Wednesday we'll hear from Air Products 
and Continental, before Thursday sees reports from Walt Disney, Cisco Systems, Siemens, Deutsche Telekom, 
Merck, Applied Materials, Tencent and Nissan Motor.  Though the main central bank decisions are now out of the 
way, there'll be a number of speakers over the week ahead, particularly given an ECB forum on central banking this 
week. The expected highlight will be a policy panel on Thursday featuring ECB President Lagarde, Federal Reserve 
Chair Powell and Bank of England Governor Bailey, so that'll definitely be one to keep an eye on, not least given 
the potential for further stimulus as coronavirus cases continue to rise on both sides of the Atlantic.  Looking back at 
more of last week now, with the Senate looking likely to remain with the Republicans at this point, markets viewed a 
divided government as bullish for Treasuries. US 10yr Treasury yields fell -5.5bps (+5.6bps Friday) to finish the 
week at 0.819%. In Europe core sovereign debt went the other way and the risk on dominated rather than the micro 
of US fiscal policy as 10yr Gilt yields rose +1.2bps (+4.0bps Friday) to 0.27%, while 10yr Bund yields were up 
+0.6bps (+1.6bps Friday) to -0.62%. Peripheral sovereign debt spreads to bunds tightened as risk sentiment rose. 
Italian (-12.5bps), Spanish (-4.4bps), Portuguese (-3.1bps) and Greek (-14.0bps) 10yr bond yields all tightened to 
bunds. Credit spreads in the US and Europe also tightened on the week, particularly high yield debt. US HY cash 
spreads were -56bps tighter, while Europe HY cash spreads tightened -40bps. IG US cash spreads were -9bps 
tighter and -3bps in Europe.  The US dollar also reacted to the election news as the greenback fell -1.92% (-0.32% 
Friday) on the week, the largest one week fall since late March and is now at its lowest level since late August. This 
drop in the dollar supported commodity prices as WTI (+3.77%) and Brent crude (+5.31%) rose sharply. Metals also 
gained with a +3.49% rise in copper prices and gold gaining +3.86%, its best week in just over three months. 
Bitcoin was interestingly up +14.03% (+2.03% Friday)  In terms of data released on Friday, US payrolls were the big 
highlight. The US labour market unexpectedly strengthened last month, having added +638k jobs (vs 580k 
expected) which dropped the unemployment rate to 6.9% (vs 7.6% expected). Underneath the headline numbers 
there were some worrying trends, as the number of long-term unemployed (jobless for 27 weeks or more) increased 
by 1.15 million to 3.56 million, the highest level since early 2014. In Europe, German industrial production came in 
under expectations at +1.6% (vs. +2.5 expected), though this was an improvement from last month's revised +0.5% 
gain. Italian retail sales for September fell less than expected at -0.8% (vs -1.5% expected), but this was a sharp 
reduction from last month's +8.2%. [ 1]: http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/l9uPbStQ3YU/sp-

our willingness to fly is partisan[1] - The Air Current I know, I know. You've heard enough about politics this week,

Nov 05, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, Latin 
American carrier Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL[1] reported a loss for third-quarter 2020 as passenger 
revenues were way below the year-ago levels despite the recent improvement in travel demand. Again, due to the 
coronavirus-induced disruptions that diminished air travel, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] 
suffered a loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 (ended Sep 30, 2020).Coronavirus-led low travel demand also 
caused a 63.1% year-over-year plunge in the regional carrier SkyWest's SKYW[3] third-quarter 2020 earnings. 
Further, tepid passenger revenues induced losses for the likes of American Airlines AAL[4], JetBlue Airways 
JBLU[5] and Southwest Airlines LUV[6] in the September quarter as mentioned in theprevious week's write-up[7]. 
Synopsis of the Past Week's Top Stories 1. Gol Linhas incurred a loss (excluding 89 cents from non-recurring 
items) of 91 cents per share in the third quarter of 2020, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 80 
cents. Net operating revenues of $181.4 million also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $188 million. 
Moreover, the top line declined significantly year over year with passenger revenues plummeting 74.9% on a year-
over-year basis due to suppressed air-travel demand amid coronavirus concerns. For the fourth quarter, Gol Linhas 
anticipates capacity to double in the third quarter.2. Ryanair, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) currently, incurred a 
loss (excluding $1.08 from non-recurring items) of 12 cents per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, narrower 
than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 26 cents. Quarterly revenues of $1,228.4 million also surpassed 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,174.1 million but plunged more than 60% year over year due to the 62% 
decline in traffic. Ryanair expects its traffic to be approximately 38 million in fiscal 2021[8].You can seethe complete 
list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[9]3. SkyWest's third-quarter 2020 earnings per share of 66 
cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents. However, earnings declined 63.1% year over year due 
to coronavirus-induced low air-travel demand. Moreover, quarterly revenues of $457.5 million tanked 39.8% year 
over year but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $426.8 million. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a 
significant cut in the number of scheduled flights resulting in the year-over-year downside[10].4. In an expansion 
update, Southwest Airlines announced that it will operate flights to five destinations from Chicago's O'Hare 
International Airport starting Feb 14, 2021. The destinations are Nashville (four times a day), Baltimore/Washington 
(four times daily), Denver (six times a day), Dallas (Love Field: four flights daily) and Phoenix (twice a day). On Mar 
11, 2021, the carrier will start serving its fourth destination in Colorado. The new location is Colorado Springs.

Nov 04, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The European low-
cost airline Ryanair said in a tweet[1] Wednesday that President Donald Trump's premature claim to have won the 
2020 election was "like disembarking before the plane has landed." "We don't recommend," it added. Ryanair's 
tweet came moments after Trump claimed that he had won the 2020 US presidential election in a speech at the 
White House — despite votes in key states still being counted. 
"We were getting ready to win this election," Trump said. "Frankly, we did win this election." Visit Business Insider's 
homepage for more stories[2].Ryanair, one of the world's biggest airlines, has compared President Donald Trump's 
premature claim to have won the 2020 election[3] to leaving a plane before it has landed.In the early hours of 
Wednesday, Trump told a White House press conference[4] that "frankly, we did win this election[5]." Votes were 
still being counted in key states.Hours later, the budget airline tweeted[6]: "Trump declaring victory this early is like 
disembarking before the plane has landed — we don't recommend." —Ryanair (@Ryanair) November 4, 2020[7] In 
his speech, Trump said also claimed vote-counting was a "major fraud on our nation," without offering 
evidence.Ireland -based Ryanair wasn't the only company to respond to Trump's claims: Both Facebook and Twitter 
immediately clamped down on social media posts from Trump, but in very different ways[8].Read more: Trump and

flights during the coronavirus pandemic[10].In May, the European low-cost airline said in a statement[11] it would 
cut around 3,000 jobs — 15% of its workforce.It also said it planned pay cuts of up to 20%, would offer unpaid leave 
to some employees, and would shut its bases across Europe until travel demand picks up. CEO Michael O'Leary

View original post here[2]. Summary:  FDA warns on antigen tests  Netherlands expands and extends lockdown  NJ 
sees 7-day average infection rate double in a month  Italy mulls more restrictions  Greece expands lockdown  
Global cases top 47 million  Global 7-day average hits highest level yet  Argentina to import new vaccine  Bulgaria 
reports record deaths  * * *  Update (1515ET): Just as more people (including the CEO of Ryanair during an 
interview yesterday on CNBC) argue that lockdowns should be substituted for mass-testing regimes relying on the 
new fast-turnaround antigen tests, the FDA has issued a new alert to clinical laboratories implying that these faster 
tests aren't reliable by warning that false positives "can occur".    On Twitter, commentators pointed out that this 
feature was already well known, and that mass-testing would make up for it. The announcement was prompted by 
reports of false tests in nursing homes, according to Reuters. The warning comes after the administration signed 
deals with companies to supply these new tests - which are growing in popularity as more countries look to thwart 
fast-growing epidemics with faster testing turnaround.  As Reuters[3] explains, Antigen tests detect proteins on the 
surface of the virus. 
They require an uncomfortable nasal or throat swab, and can produce results more quickly than molecular tests - 
which detect genetic material in the virus - but are considered less accurate.  * * * Update (1434ET): It's mid-
afternoon in the US, and with the world holding its breath awaiting the outcome of Tuesday's vote, news headlines 
have been unsurprisingly light on COVID-19 news.  The biggest news from the US and Europe on Tuesday starts in 
the US, where NJ, the state with the highest rate of spread, has seen hospitalizations climb, with 1,133 as of Nov. 
2. That number has more than doubled in the span of a month. Daily cases have also doubled, to 1,832 on 
Tuesday, from 957 on Oct. 2.  #COVID19[4] UPDATE: NJ has 1,832 new positive cases for a cumulative total of 
242,825. We're reporting 18 new confirmed deaths for a total of 14,582 deaths. This #ElectionDay[5], we're still in

pic.twitter.com/y2jeRDKdNU[7] — Governor Phil Murphy (@GovMurphy) November 3, 2020[8]  NYC, meanwhile, 
saw its 7-day average continue to rise, reaching 605 as of Nov. 1.  "We're watching that very carefully," de Blasio 
said during a Tuesday news briefing. "Some of that again is because of a lot more testing, but it's still cause for 
concern."  Greece recorded 2,166 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, a new record, as the government 
placed Thessaloniki, the country's second city, under lockdown.  In Italy, health officials registered another 28,244 
new cases, the biggest jump yet, along with 353 new deaths.  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced plans to

extend the country's partial lockdown until mid-December and impose additional restrictions as the number of 
COVID-19-related hospitalizations continues to rise.  * * *  While more than 100 million people have already voted in 
Tuesday's US election, cases and hospitalizations have climbed in several swing states, including Wisconsin and 
Iowa, among others, in recent weeks, while deaths have edged higher, but not nearly enough to validate the 
increasingly ominous warnings from Dr. Anthony Fauci.    The most notable trend over the past couple of weeks in 
the west has been the acceleration of the coronavirus across Europe, leading to a wave of new lockdowns and 
restrictions, as both positivity rates and fatality rates among the biggest European countries have surpassed the 
US.    Source: JPM  Now that the final JHU numbers are in, it looks like the world saw 439,621 new cases on 
Monday, with roughly 84,000 of those coming from the US.  Even though the global number didn't top 500k again 
on Monday, thanks to the US and Europe, the seven-day moving average of global coronavirus cases has 
exceeded 500,000 cases for the first time ever, just as total cases are reaching 46.8 million. Europe and the US 
have seen case surges in recent weeks, with American battleground states in the South and the Midwest 
particularly hard hit.  Across the US, most states are seeing case numbers rise, though there are some notable

across the northeast and midwest.    Source: mSightly[9]  Here's some more COVID-19 news from overnight and 
Tuesday morning:  Spain and France reported new records on Monday with the former reporting 55k new cases 
and the latter 52k (Source: JHU).  South Korea's core consumer price index for October declined 0.3% year-on-
year, marking the sharpest fall since September 1999, as the pandemic dampened domestic demand and a 
temporary government subsidy on mobile phone bills weighed on prices (Source: Nikkei).  Argentina will import 10 
million doses of Russia's experimental COVID-19 vaccine between December and January, as infections continue 
to climb in the South American country (Source: Nikkei).  A gauge of the rate of increase in coronavirus infections in 
Germany has fallen in recent days, though it's too early to conclude that there has been a turning point, according 
to the RKI public health institute.  The curve looks to be flattening somewhat at the moment, but this has to be 
treated with a great deal of caution as a few days cannot provide concrete evidence of a change in the trend,' RKI 
Vice President Lars Schaade said at a news conference in Berlin. The institute's virus reproduction factor, which 
last week climbed to as high as 1.45, was at 1.07 on Monday. A reading above 1 represents exponential growth 
(Source: Newswires).  Bulgaria also reported a record number of Covid-19 deaths. New cases in the Balkan country

quarter came in at €225.5 million, against profit of €910.2 million in the year-ago period. Traffic dropped 62% year 
over year to 16.7 million as a result of travel restrictions imposed by European Union governments to curb the

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-will-not-provide-refunds-for-november-flights/Ryanair customers will 
not be refunded for flights in November, according to its boss, despite the UK government banning all but essential 
travel.Michael O'Leary said if a flight was operating, passengers would not get their money back but they could 
change to a later flight without paying a fee. 
From Thursday, all but essential travel will be banned under a second lockdown[1]. Ryanair said the first lockdown 
and subsequent restrictions resulted in an 80% drop in passenger numbers[2]. It said 17.1 million people travelled 
on the airline in the six months to September, compared with 85.7 million last year. The carrier reported a €196.5m 
(174m) loss for the period compared with a €1.15bn profit last year. But it warned the situation was likely to worsen, 
saying it 'will continue to be a hugely challenging year for Ryanair'. The new lockdown measures for England to 
stop the spread of the coronavirus were announced on Saturday and are expected to come into force on 5 
November following a vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday. They will remain in place until at least 2 
December though Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said restrictions could extend beyond that date[3]. 
Commenting on what it means for people who have booked flights, Mr O'Leary told the BBC's Today programme: 'If 
a flight is operating then no, we will not be offering refunds. 'But what customers can avail of is our change facility 
and we've waived the change fee so if they have booking in November they can change it and move it to December 
or January if needs be. But there won't be refunds on flights that are operating and travelling.' Revenues in the six 
months to September plunged to €1.1bn from €5.3bn last year. During the period, air travel ground to a virtual halt 
as countries introduced measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus. However, when flights did resume Ryanair 
said passenger confidence and forward bookings 'were negatively impacted by the return of uncoordinated EU 
government flight restrictions in September and October which heavily curtailed travel to and from much of Central 
Europe, the UK, Ireland, Austria, Belgium and Portugal'. Read more: Ryanair will not provide refunds for November

Wizz Looks to Conquer the World, or At Least Europe

Oct 27, 2020( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  I used to think of Wizz as that 
Central/Eastern European airline with the goofy name and pink and purple airplanes. That image is outdated, to say 
the least. Sure, it still has the name and colors, but make no mistake about it; Wizz is a European powerhouse. 
It's the Ryanair of Central and Eastern Europe, and I mean that as the highest praise. But it's more than that, and it 
continues to grow quickly. While many airlines see the COVID pandemic as a threat to their very existence, Wizz 
sees nothing but opportunity. The airline was founded in Hungary in 2003 with its first flight in 2004. Its main 
investor was Indigo Partners, Bill Franke's company that has backed Spirit, Frontier, Volaris, Tiger, Sky, and 
more.Wizz's initial wheelhouse was in the middle of the continent, but it has always had an important presence in 
London via far-out Luton as well.  Wizz Air % of Scheduled Departures by Region 2004 - 2020 In this chart, the pink 
shading in the back shows the number of scheduled departures by year using Cirium's[1] schedule data. Wizz has 
been growing at a breakneck pace. It first hit 100 daily departures in 2008, 200 in 2011, 300 in 2015, 400 in 2017, 
500 in 2018, and 600 in 2020. Next year it is on pace to increase from around 610 daily to 693, though everything 
after the pandemic began is not exactly reliable. I'm sure Wizz has schedules in there that aren't being flown. Those 
lines on the chart show the breakdown by region.The initial beauty of Wizz was that it had incredibly low costs and 
was in the right place. As the European Union expanded and borders fell, many of the people from Central and 
Eastern Europe migrated to Western and Southern Europe where the jobs were more plentiful and better paying. 
That created an instant need for cheap flights to get friends and family back and forth.In Wizz's first full year of 
operation, 2005, its two largest bases were Poland and the UK. Since that time, Wizz has tried a lot of things and 
failed a fair bit. That, however, is perfectly acceptable. Without trying, the airline wouldn't have had so much 
success along the way. Here's something of a scorecard. Wizz WinsAustria - Jumped into Vienna in 2018 when 
airberlin failed and every airline tried to join the party. While others have pulled out , Wizz has only grown, recently 
adding Salzburg as well.Germany - Dortmund began in 2004 and has become huge for the airline. Half of the 
airline's German flights depart from there. Memmingen, Cologne, and Berlin have all succeeded too.Moldova - It's 
not a big place, but after starting in 2013, it now runs about half the flights touching the country. Many smaller 
European countries have seen this same trend.Poland - The first Wizz route was to Poland, and it now serves 9 
cities in the country with more than 25,000 flights a year.Romania - Wizz didn't even start serving the country until 
2006, but it really stepped on the gas in recent years. In 2020, Romania was the number two country for the airline 
behind Poland and just ahead of the UK.United Kingdom - Started London/Luton flying early and has done nothing 
Wizz Looks to Conquer the World, or At Least Europe
but expand since then.Wizz LossesEgypt - First tried to serve the market from Ukraine in 2008 to 2010, then tried 
from Poland in 2014 and Hungary in 2015 but hasn't been back.Germany - A winner and a loser Secondary airports 
in big cities (where Ryanair flies) have not done well. Wizz left Lubeck for Hamburg in 2016 and abandoned Weeze 
in 2012 without even trying Dusseldorf.Ireland - Entered in 2006, but thanks to weak demand and competition from 
Ryanair, it left in 2013.Turkey - There have been a couple efforts to serve Turkey both from Hungary and Ukraine. 
The airline left in 2016 and hasn't returned.Ukraine - Wizz was bullish on Ukraine to the point that it started a 
locally-based subsidiary in 2008. As Ukraine's fortunes go, however, so do Wizz's. The Ukrainian airline is gone, 
but it still remains an important point for the Hungarian airline. And it has begun growing again, so maybe there's 
long term hope. On the whole, this penchant for trying new things and accepting failure has served the airline well. 
Now, with the pandemic, it is throwing things into overdrive.While most airlines are looking to defer aircraft 
deliveries, Wizz is actually speeding them up[2]. It has been watching airlines pull back during the pandemic, and it 
smells opportunity, adding routes at a furious pace. Here are some of the bigger projects. Wizz New 
ExperimentsItaly - Opened a base at Milan/Malpensa in July and Catania just this month. It also just announced a 
coming base in Bari. It continues to grow throughout the country.Norway - After a long-standing presence, finally 
opening a base in Oslo. Also opening a base in Trondheim. It is beginning domestic Norway flights, clearly looking 
to kill off Norwegian.Russia - Decided to open a base at St Petersburg in September with growth already baked 
in.United Arab Emirates - Has served Dubai/World Central a little, but now created Wizz Abu Dhabi with flights to 
Athens, Alexandria (Egypt), Kutaisi, Larnca, Odesa, and Yerevan starting soon. The airline just received its 
operating certificate and has big plans.United Kingdom - Opened bases at Doncaster and Gatwick this month. 
Gatwick has been served since 2016, but now it will base aircraft and wants to grow as fast as it can gets slots. The 
Abu Dhabi airline is interesting since it's made possible by the A321neo which is now on the property at the airline. 
There are more opportunities like that further afield. As long as it doesn't require a widebody, Wizz is going to be 
curious.Keep an eye on these guys, and don't be surprised if Wizz ends up being a good option on your next trip 
within Europe. There's no end to the airline's growth in sight. Not everything will work, but if this success rate 
continues, that's still a winning strategy. [ 1]: http://cirium.com [ 2]: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-

Oct 22, 2020( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  Get ready for something weird. 
The latest entry in the 'Who the F*&#38;@ is' series is actually an airline with an idea I don't hate and it's Italian. 
This airline appears to be focused on taking advantage of Alitalia's stupidity, and that's a strategy I can get behind. 
That being said, it could turn ugly quickly if too much, ahem, ego gets involved. According to Airways, EGO is 
finalizing plans to start up[1] next summer from its Milan base using Embraer 190/195 aircraft. How on Earth does 
Italy need ANOTHER airline? Ah, well, that's why this is an interesting one. First aircraft named Martina - Image via 
EGO Milan, as you may well know, has two primary airports. Close-in Linate is about 25 minutes just east of town. 
Malpensa lies about a 50 minute drive or train ride further out to the northwest. Linate's relatively-short runway 
(about 8,000 feet) means it doesn't handle any long-haul flights. Those all go over to Malpensa. Malpensa is also 
more convenient to certain parts of the region, including Lake Como and other tourist spots. Despite that, Linate is 
generally viewed as the more convenient, preferable option. It's kind of like a Washington National vs. Dulles 
situation.Over  the years, Alitalia has had a love-hate relationship with Milan despite it being Italy's business center. 
Alitalia has always had its main hub in Rome, but on occasion it decides it wants a bigger presence in Milan. It has 
regularly had service from restricted Linate throughout Italy and to European capitals, but Malpensa has generally 
only served long-haul and Rome for the airline. In reincarnation plan #8,593, Alitalia is now reported to be leaving 
Malpensa entirely[2]. Even if it does remain, it will be with skeleton service to New York and perhaps Tokyo. Up 
until this year, European service from Malpensa was from a mix of low-cost carriers and Qatar-surrogate Air Italy 
(former Meridiana). The biggest carrier is easyJet with about a third of flights. Wizz and Ryanair have been building 
up as as well, smelling opportunity. Air Italy was the only airline that worked with other airlines in a traditional way, 
but it shut down earlier this year. That's where EGO comes in.With all these longer-haul flights coming into 
Malpensa, EGO wants to target codesharing so it can take passengers beyond into smaller Italian towns. Combine 
that connectivity with a local base that prefers Malpensa for one reason or another, and you might be able to fill up 
a 100-seat airplane, at least during the summer.Of course, to succeed with this, EGO would have to be focused and 
smart. That may be difficult. EGO, shockingly, seems a bit distracted.Here's the logo:Ok, great. No problem there. 
But here is how the logo is described on the airline's website[3]:The logo itself tells the story of EGO's DNA: as the 
sun is at the centre of the solar system, around which all the planets rotate, at EGO the focus is the host from which 
all products and services are based. Each circle represents at the same time, a planet, a colour, a quality, a 
personality, each one unique and different.Orange is the sun that represents energy, dynamism, warmth, masculine

character.Green is the earth, solid, reliable, fluid, more feminine in characterPink is the mutable, creative moon, 
bearer of changeWE RESPECT THE PERSONALITY OF EVERYONE, EVEN OF OUR PLANES Each aircraft 
represents a personality, and like them, it has a different colour and a PERSON NAME.I could go on, but I'd rather 
not at least, not until I can have some of what they're smoking. This seems like an airline that, shall we say, may not 
have the focus to succeed. 'Focus' may not be the best word to use with this airline. After all, the Airways article 
shows a route map with all kinds of short hops criss-crossing the country with focus cities in Parma, Forli, and 
Florence. Parma and Forli are tiny airports with very little service today. Has every other airline missed some golden 
opportunity here? That seems unlikely. So, it appears we have an airline with a solid opportunity to make money out 
of Malpensa in the summer months. That, unfortunately, is not enough to make an airline work on the whole. It will 
need to find ways to live through the winter. Since Alitalia has shrunk and will continue to shrink AND Air Italy has 
gone bust, you'd think there might be an opportunity for a regional feeder airline with smaller aircraft to make a 
niche work. While its not exactly clear what niche might help the airline to strike gold year-round, Alitalia's inability 
— or even unwilligness - to respond is helpful for a start-up. The bigger concern is the growing presence of Wizz, 
Ryanair, easyJet, and Volotea. Those are formidable low-cost carriers, albeit ones that don't generally work well 
with others. Sliding into that narrow niche to fill the shrinking void is going to take focus and a lot of luck. But for 
EGO to succeed, it's going to need to leave ego out of it. [ 1]: https://airwaysmag.com/airlines/ego-airways-is-ready-

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-slashes-flights-as-second-wave-engulfs-europe/Ryanair is going into 
hibernation for the winter, operating just two in five of its scheduled services as the second wave of the pandemic 
envelops the European economy.Job losses were inevitable, Europe's busiest airline said. It carried 150 million 
passengers a year on short-haul services before the pandemic, with its trademark lack of in-flight hospitality, but 
said it would be cutting the schedule from 60 per cent to 40 per cent[1] through to March. 
The decision is effectively a running-up of the white flag by Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's outspoken chief executive, 
who during the initial lockdowns and fleet grounding in the spring confidently targeted flying 100 million passengers 
this year on a schedule running at 80 per cent capacity. He has now said he is aiming to break even and minimise 
cash burn by carrying 38 million passengers on a winter flight schedule running at 40 per cent, with planes 
operating 70 per cent full compared with the 90 per cent-plus it ordinarily targets. 'These winter schedule cuts have 
been forced upon us by government mismanagement of European Union air travel,' he said. He added that 
Ryanair's capacity could be 'further revised downwards if EU governments continue to mismanage air travel and 
impose more lockdowns this winter'. Its main rival at the budget end of the European short-haul market, Easyjet, 
has said it has cut capacity to 25 per cent through to the turn of the year after reporting that it expects to have lost 
at least 1.25 billion in its financial year to the end of September. Mr O'Leary urged member states of the EU to act 
as one in adapting the European Commission's proposed air travel 'traffic light system', which envisages 
unrestricted travel between countries and regions where there are fewer than 50 cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 
people. Ad hoc restrictions between countries had, Ryanair said, caused forward bookings to weaken. It said its 
capacity-cut would be affected by continuing to run as much as 65 per cent of its routes but with reduced 
frequencies. Aircraft are being withdrawn altogether from its two west of Ireland bases at Cork and Shannon and 
also from Toulouse in southern France, with other aircraft being mothballed across Belgium, Germany, Spain, 
Portugal and Austria. Ryanair said at the outset of the pandemic that it expected to make 3,000 people redundant. 
That figure was revised downwards as pilots and crew accepted pay cuts and unpaid leave during the summer, but 
it will now rise again. 'It is inevitable,' Mr O'Leary said, 'given the scale of these cutbacks that we will be 
implementing more unpaid leave and job sharing this winter in those bases where we have agreed reduced working 
time and pay. 'This is a better short-term outcome than mass job losses. There will regrettably be more 
redundancies at those small number of cabin crew bases where we have still not secured agreement on working

time and pay cuts.' Having halved from its early 2020 high of more than €16 each, Ryanair stock had clawed its way 
back to nearly €13. Shares closed last night down 4.3 per cent at €11.77. Read more: Ryanair slashes flights as

Oct 12, 2020( Customer Service Blog: http://www.hyken.com Delivered by Newstex)  Each week I read a number of 
customer service and customer experience articles from various resources. Here are my top five picks from last 
week. I have added my comment about each article and would like to hear what you think too. Radical Empathy 
And Other Ways To Rethink Your Customer Experience[1] by Bridget Brennan (Forbes) Our world is changing by 
the minute (or so it seems), but amidst all the disruption, one thing remains constant: women's domination of 
consumer spending. 
That fact alone provides a valuable compass for innovating your customer experience during Covid-19, as well as 
reimagining what it could look like post pandemic. My Comment: Let's start this week's Top Five with one of the 
hottest topics in customer service and experience, and that's empathy. The author includes five customer loyalty 
strategies, the first one being empathy. That's what caught my eye. She refers to a deep understanding of your 
customer as radical empathy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the concept of empathy has emerged as an 
important way to communicate with customers, and may very well turn out to be the business 'word of the year.' 
Four proven ways to foster stronger customer loyalty[2] by Liem Viet Ngo (UNSW Business School) Managers and 
marketers who want to boost customer loyalty post-COVID-19 should focus on four key areas, according to UNSW 
Business School research My Comment: In my quest to find the best way to create customer loyalty, here is a great 
article that sets up the importance of going for loyalty followed by four sound strategies. These are very strategic 
and will make you think. Of course, you want to create a great experience (number four), but you also want to build 
'equity' with the brand, relationship and value proposition. Does Ryanair deliver poor service or is it a CX success 
story?[3] by Sampson Lee Ryanair has long been criticized for its poor service and is commonly regarded as 
delivering bad customer experiences. But there's a train of thought that suggests, contrary to this, Ryanair is in fact 
a customer experience success story My Comment: So, we know that Ryanair doesn't win awards for great 
customer service. On the contrary, they are recognized for their poor service. They don't hide it. If you want a 
comfortable first-class seat, this airline is not for you. But, if you want the lowest prices, then you've found cheap-
fare utopia (my term, not theirs). If the value perceived (low fares) is more important than the experience, the value 
will push the experience aside. Ryanair doesn't promise you the best service. They promise you a low price. And for 
them, it works. 13 Ways To Leverage The Trust-Building Power Of Company And Personal Accolades[4] by Expert 
Panel (Forbes Agency Council) You can proclaim your value proposition in emails, ads and owned media, but leads 
will find few things more persuasive than the praise of happy consumers or recognition from industry leaders and 
5 Top Customer Service Articles For the Week of October 12, 2020
peers. Here, 13 members of Forbes Agency Council look at ways of leveraging accolades to maintain customer 
loyalty while winning new business. My Comment: A powerful way to build trust with your company is to have your 
customers evangelize your products and services. Word-of-Mouth marketing, as it is called, is about others 
testifying on your behalf. Friends, colleagues and even strangers who comment and share their opinions can help 
build the trust needed to get a customer to want to do business with you. How do you do it? Here are 13 ways from 
an Expert Panel put together by the Forbes Agency Council. Building customer service resilience during continued 
uncertainty[5] by Paul Selby (A Customer Service Perspective) As living with the pandemic has become a fact of 
life, customers' expectations for great customer service have returned. And with uncertain times still ahead, now is 
the time to bolster the means of delivering customer service in a resilient and flexible manner to meet those 
expectations. My Comment: Paul Selby is an executive at ServiceNow. Somehow he finds time to write articles, it 
seems weekly about the topic of service and experience. This is an interesting take on how resilient your service is 
during an uncertain economy, such as the one that COVID-19 has delivered to us. He shares five ideas worth 
thinking about. Some of this may seem like old news, but today it's more important than ever.BONUS8 Ways to 
Stand Out in Your Next Virtual Meeting[6] by Shaun Belding (The Belding Group) This article shares eight of the 
very basics to remember for your next Zoom (or other virtual meeting) call: My Comment: It's not customer service, 
but it is about creating a better experience for customers and employees - during your next virtual meeting or 
presentation. We've all been seemingly over-exposed to poorly managed online meetings. My thought is that it's not 
the online meeting, but the people presenting at these meetings and events. Read this article, and if you're not 
using these ideas already, I'll guarantee you'll be better at your next virtual meeting. Your customers and colleagues 
will really appreciate you for the effort! Shep Hyken[7]is a customer service expert, professional speaker and New

Oct 06, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted disappointing traffic numbers for September, primarily due to weak air travel demand stemming 
from the COVID-19 pandemic. This Ireland-based carrier reported a 64% year-over-year plunge in September 
traffic to merely 5.1 million passengers.Ryanair operated approximately 53% of the normal September schedule 
with a load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) of 71%. On a rolling-annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair 
(including the LaudaMotion unit) declined 47% to 79.9 million.Apart from the traffic results, Ryanair was in news 
recently when it announced that it will reduce its October capacity by a further 20%[2] due to coronavirus-related 
travel restrictions by European Union governments. In mid-August, the carrier had already announced plans to 
slash its October capacity by 20%[3] due to a drop in bookings following surge in coronavirus cases in some 
European Union countries.With the additional capacity reductions, Ryanair now expects its October capacity to 
decrease from 50% to approximately 40% of October 2019 levels. 
Even at this reduced schedule, the airline anticipates to maintain a load factor (percentage of seats filled with 
passengers) of more than 70% in October. Zacks Rank &#38; Key Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #4 
(Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation [4]sector are Canadian Pacific Railway Limited 
CP[5], Werner Enterprises, Inc. WERN[6] and Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc KNX[7]. While Canadian 
Pacific and Knight-Swift carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Werner sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see

years) growth rate for Canadian Pacific, Werner and Knight-Swift is pegged at 8.5%, 8.5% and 15%, respectively.

Oct 06, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, United 
Airlines UAL[1] announced its decision to re-start nonstop services to China later this month through flights 
connecting San Francisco and Shanghai. Meanwhile, with the $25-billion federal aid having expired on Sep 30 and 
a second round of stimulus not yet approved despite positive signals to that end, United Airlines laid off around 
13,000 employees.American Airlines AAL[2] also went ahead with its earlier decision to retrench 19,000 employees 
following the expiry of the pandemic package deadline. However, on a positive note, CEOs of both above-
mentioned carriers hinted at the possibility of recalling the departed employees if a second round of fiscal stimulus 
gets approved in the coming days.Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways JBLU[3] was in news by virtue of its decision to avail 
of loans up to $1.14 billion from the United States Department of the Treasury. Also, American Airlines opted for 
this facility and is eligible to borrow up to $5.5 billion from the Treasury as mentioned in the previous week's write-
up[4].Notably, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] grabbed headlines by virtue of the update that it is 
currently negotiating with the plane manufacturer Boeing on its current order of up to 210 Boeing 737 MAX planes, 
per a Reuters report[6]. Synopsis of the Past Week's Top Stories 1. United Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank 
#4 (Sell), aims to resume nonstop services on the San Francisco-Shanghai route beginning Oct 21, 2020. The 
carrier will utilize the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft to serve this route on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and 
Sundays. 
Passengers will be able to return to San Francisco from Shanghai on Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and 
Sundays[7].You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[8]2. With demand for 
leisure travel improving,Spirit Airlines SAVE[9]decided to broaden its network by restarting operations to the Haitian 
city of Cap-Haitien. Services on the Cap-Haitien-Fort Lauderdale route are scheduled to be resumed thrice a week 
on Dec 3, 2020.By recommencing non-stop flights to this favorite tourist spot of Haiti, Spirit Airlines aims to take 
advantage of the impending winter holiday season. Additional traffic on the route will boost revenues for the airline, 
which like other carriers is suffering coronavirus-induced revenue weakness. Notably, the flights will connect Cap-
Haitien to 22 major cities in the United States[10]3. American Airlines and United Airlines removed around 32,000 
employees in all following the termination of the Payroll Support Program for the airline industry. However, 
Southwest Airlines' LUV[11] CEO Gary C. Kelly reiterated that there will be no involuntary salary reductions or 
headcount cut through 2020-end. He stated that the carrier is looking at employee pay cuts to avoid furloughs. As 
Airline Stock Roundup: UAL to Resume Shanghai Flights, Job-Cut Updates & More
part of the company's various cost-cutting efforts, the CEO, who is already on a slashed remuneration, will forego 
his entire salary through the end of next year.4. In a bid to bolster its liquidity position in the face of a tepid travel-
demand scenario, JetBlue Airways signed a loan and guarantee agreement with the United States Department of 
the Treasury under the CARES Act. Notably, JetBlue already borrowed $115 million of the eligible amount. The 
carrier now has the option to borrow further through Mar 26, 2021. In connection with the loan contract, this low-
cost carrier inked a warrant deal with the Treasury.5. Due to the coronavirus-induced lackluster performance of 
carriers in the Northern Hemisphere during summer, International Air Transport Association (IATA) issued a 
downbeat current-year airline traffic forecast. Per IATA, global air traffic is expected to plummet 66% in 2020 from 
its 2019-levels. The previous projection had hinted at a 63% year-over-year plunge. Such a dismal prediction 
reflects a weaker-than-expected recovery in air-travel demand[12]. Performance The following table shows the 
price movement of major airline players over the past week and during the past six months.The table above shows 
that all airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week, courtesy of the bullish comments from House 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi regarding an additional federal help for the airlines. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index has appreciated 4.1% to $57.74. Moreover, during the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index has surged 44.6% owing to impressive gains at the likes of Gol Linhas GOL[13], Spirit Airlines and United 
Airlines. What's Next in the Airline Space? Considering that another stimulus package for the airlines may be a 
possibility, as hinted by Pelosi, investors will look forward to the updates on the same. Breakout Biotech Stocks with 
Triple-Digit Profit Potential The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists 
develop treatments for thousands of diseases. They're also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase 
our vulnerability to these diseases.Zacks has just released Century of Biology: 7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now

IATA 's 2020 Traffic Forecast Deteriorates Due to Dull Summer
IATA's 2020 Traffic Forecast Deteriorates Due to Dull Summer

Oct 02, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The fact that the ongoing 
coronavirus pandemic has upended air travel is no longer news to us. Even though more than six months have 
elapsed since the health peril was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, the dreaded disease 
continues to cripple airline stocks by drastically eating into their passenger revenues.Due to the ill-effects of this 
global health peril, the usually busy summer season for the carriers in the Northern Hemisphere turned out to be a 
damp squib this time. This dismal performance prompted the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to 
downgrade its current-year airline traffic forecast.Per IATA[1], global air traffic is expected to plummet 66% in 2020 
compared with the 2019- levels. The previous projection had hinted at a 63% year-over-year decline. 
The dismal prediction reflects the weaker-than-expected recovery in air-travel demand. The emergence of fresh 
cases in Europe and the re-imposition of restrictions on many European countries are likely to serve as a further 
dampener to the already slow rebound. Notably, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] recently 
announced that it will slash its October capacity by a further 20% due to travel limitations imposed by the European 
Union governments.Given the current scenario, IATA expects air-travel demand to be restored at a much sluggish 
pace than estimated earlier. The airline association predicts that December traffic (measured in revenue passenger 
kilometers or RPKs) is now projected to plunge 68% from the 55% year-over-year fall predicted earlier.Apart from 
the revised traffic forecast, IATA unveiled the global traffic report for August, which was equally disastrous. Per 
IATA, which represents 290 airlines across the globe, RPKs in August slumped 75.3% year over year. Capacity 
(measured in available seat kilometers) was down 63.8% from the August-2019 level. With traffic deteriorating more 
than capacity, load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) contracted 27.2 points to 58.5%. Such a tepid scenario 
can be gauged from the fact that the reading for load factor represented an all-time low for the month.Per Alexandre 
de Juniac, IATA's director general and CEO: 'August's disastrous traffic performance puts a cap on the industry's 
worst-ever summer season'. The sole bright spot was the performance of the carriers in their domestic markets 
(apart from Australia and Japan), which bettered the international market levels with the recovery in demand on the 
international front being 'virtually non-existent' per Juniac.The improvement in the domestic markets is evident from 
the fact that the U.S. carriers including Delta Air Lines DAL[3], United Airlines UAL[4], American Airlines AAL[5], 
Southwest Airlines LUV[6], Alaska Air Group ALK[7] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[8] recorded an uptick in their 
respective August domestic traffic numbers from the July readings. While domestic traffic for the U.S. carriers in 
August declined 69.3% year over year, the July performance was worse with a 71.5% plunge. Wrapping Up Even 
IATA 's 2020 Traffic Forecast Deteriorates Due to Dull Summer
though traffic is likely to be down significantly year over year at least in the remainder of the year as can be figured 
out from IATA's downbeat forecast, the only solace is the improvement in the metric of most domestic flights across 
the globe. Airlines will be hoping that the upturn on their home turf continues on the back of the recently 
implemented safety-protocols to attract passengers. They will also be expecting a vaccine to soon hit the medical 
market for neutralizing the dreaded disease so that people can take to the skies without any apprehension,Come 
what may, we expect investors interested in this not-so-long-ago high-flying space to stay tuned for further updates 
on how things pan out for the airlines in the near term. These Stocks Are Poised to Soar Past the Pandemic The 
COVID-19 outbreak has shifted consumer behavior dramatically, and a handful of high-tech companies have 
stepped up to keep America running. Right now, investors in these companies have a shot at serious profits. For 
example, Zoom jumped 108.5% in less than 4 months while most other stocks were sinking.Our research shows 
that 5 cutting-edge stocks could skyrocket from the exponential increase in demand for 'stay at home' technologies. 
This could be one of the biggest buying opportunities of this decade, especially for those who get in early.See the 5

Sep 23, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  It is a well-documented 
fact that stocks in the airline space could not set the stage on fire in 2019 due to headwinds like lackluster cargo 
business and loss of revenues following flight cancellations stemming from the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets. 
These drawbacks continued to weigh on the airlines as they entered 2020. Despite such downsides, passenger 
revenues remained strong owing to impressive demand for air travel.However, with the advent of coronavirus, air-
travel demand nose-dived, crippling passenger revenues in turn. Situation Continues to be Grim as Pandemic 
Persists Airlines are gasping for breath even six months after the dreaded disease was declared a pandemic by the 
World Health Organization on Mar 11. This can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Airline [1]industry has shed 
24.7% of its value since March.Due to depressed passenger revenues, companies like Delta Air Lines DAL[2], 
United Airlines UAL[3] and American Airlines AAL[4] incurred loss in each of the first two quarters of 2020. In fact, 
the coronavirus impact was more severe on the second quarter than on the March quarter as the entire three-month 
period (April to June) bore the brunt of this meltdown in air-travel demand as opposed to only a single month 
(March) in the first quarter of the year.Moreover, the emergence of fresh cases in Europe and the reimposition of 
restrictions on many European countries has sparked further trouble for the aviation stocks. 
For example, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5], currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), announced that it will slash 
its October capacity by a further 20% due to travel limitations imposed by the European Union governments.You 
can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. Q3 Results Unlikely to be Any 
Better As mentioned above, airlines are far from being out of the woods as passenger revenues are way below the 
year-ago levels. Consequently, akin to the first two quarters, the September-quarter results are likely to be bleak as 
well. In fact, many airlines have come out with tepid third-quarter forecasts as they trim capacity in response to the 
dwindling demand scenario.Evidently, Southwest Airlines LUV[7] expects its third-quarter capacity to decline 30-
35% year over year. JetBlue Airways JBLU[8] expects scheduled capacity to decline approximately 55% year over 
year in the September quarter. Delta and United Airlines expect a 60% and 70% drop in their respective capacities 
for the September quarter. Hawaiian Holdings HA[9] expects third-quarter capacity to slump 87% year over year. 
The massive capacity cuts are likely to flare up unit costs in the third quarter of the year. What's Ahead? Despite 
lagging the year-ago readings, airlines are seeing some improvements particularly in terms of leisure-travel 
demand. Owing to these upsides, some airlines issued bullish cash burn-related updates. Evidently, Southwest 
Airlines management stated that air-travel demand rebounded in August after stalling in July and this uptrend has 
Coronavirus Continues to Hurt Airlines : Any Respite Soon?
continued so far in September. As a result of this recovery, the carrier came out with an upbeat third-quarter view 
for cash burn. The metric is now expected to be approximately $17 million compared with almost $20 million 
expected previously.Moreover, with the current stimulus package set to expire at this month-end, many airlines 
warned of potential layoffs October onward as they are faced with the problem of overstaffing in the face of waning 
demand. Notably, airline companies, which accepted the financial assistance under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and 
Economic Security (CARES) Act in April, are prohibited from retrenching employees through Sep 30.The entire 
scenario of job cuts can, however, be avoided if another round of federal help comes through. Many airline 
companies are lobbying for another $25-billion worth federal aid to protect jobs through March 2021. However, 
nothing has materialized yet. As a result, we expect investors to keep track of the updates on the anticipated 
second-round of federal financial grant for the airlines. 5 Stocks Set to Double Each was hand-picked by a Zacks 
expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2020. Each comes from a different sector and has unique 
qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth.Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall

Sep 22, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
Southwest Airlines LUV[1] dominated headlines by virtue of its positive update on cash burn for the September 
quarter. The bullish forecast on this key metric was primarily owing to improved air-travel demand on the leisure 
front. Moreover, booking trends have also been encouraging.Meanwhile, with no confirmation available yet on 
another round of federal stimulus for the airlines, job cuts are looming large on the industry post Sep 30 (when the 
current package expires). However, the aviation industry is looking to limit job losses in absence of no further aid. 
Updates in this respect were available from Delta Air Lines DAL[2] and United Airlines UAL[3] in the past 
week.European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] was also in the news, courtesy of its decision to trim its October 
capacity due to coronavirus-led travel restrictions. 
Notably, U.S. carriers like Hawaiian Holdings HA[5] provided a tepid capacity outlook for the September quarter as 
mentioned in the previous week's write-up[6]. Synopsis of the Past Week's Top Stories 1. Southwest Airlines 
management stated that air-travel demand rebounded in August after shrinking in July and this uptrend has 
continued so far in September. As a result of this improvement, the carrier came out with an upbeat third-quarter 
view for cash burn. The metric is now expected to be approximately $17 million compared with approximately $20 
million expected previously. To preserve liquidity, the carrier raised $18.7 billion through various means since the 
beginning of 2020. As of Sep 15, 2020, the company had cash and short-term investments worth $14.8 billion. It 
also has unencumbered assets of approximately $12 billion[7].2. According to a Reuters report[8], Delta will be able 
to avoid involuntary furloughs of its frontline employees except its pilots on Oct 1, courtesy of a large number of 
employees opting for voluntary separation programs. In a memo to employees, CEO Ed Bastian stated that the 
company will continue to reduce work hours and executive pays through the end of this year.3. Per a Reuters 
report[9], leaders of United Airlines pilots' union (Air Line Pilots Association) voted in favor of approving a tentative 
deal. Terms of the deal though are kept undisclosed. Notably, the Air Line Pilots Association represents roughly 
13,000 pilots of this Chicago-based carrier. By backing this deal, the union inched closer to protecting jobs of nearly 
2,850 pilots at United Airlines until June 2021. Following the support of union leaders, the provisional deal will be 
put to a full vote by the union members from Sep 21.4. Ryanair announced that it will slash its October capacity by 
a further 20% due to travel limitations imposed by European Union governments in the wake of coronavirus. 
Management stated that these travel constraints, often introduced on short notices, were affecting forward

bookings. With additional capacity contractions, this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) low-cost carrier now expects its 
October 2020 capacity to decrease from 50% to approximately 40% of October 2019 levels. Even at this reduced 
schedule, the airline anticipates to maintain a load factor of more than 70% next month[10].You can see the 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[11]5. Per a CNBC report[12], American Airlines 
AAL[13] is planning to begin training pilots on the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in November. This is a sign that the 
grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft's return to service is approaching. Notably, the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft has 
remained grounded since March 2019 following two crashes which killed multiple passengers. Ever since, this 
aircraft has been under scrutiny and underwent software and other changes. Last month, the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) issued the list of safety-related changes required for the jets to start flying again. Although, the 
FAA is going through the final steps before recertifying the aircraft for services, it is yet to set a specific time line for 
the same. Performance The following table shows the price performance of major airline players over the past week 
and during the past six months.The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the red over the past week 
leading the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to dip nearly 2% to $61.91. However, during the course of the past six 
months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has appreciated 60.5% owing to impressive gains at the likes of Gol Linhas 
GOL[14], Spirit Airlines and Copa Holdings. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will keep track of the 
updates on the proposed second round of federal financial grant for the airlines These Stocks Are Poised to Soar 
Past the Pandemic The COVID-19 outbreak has shifted consumer behavior dramatically, and a handful of high-tech 
companies have stepped up to keep America running. Right now, investors in these companies have a shot at 
serious profits. For example, Zoom jumped 108.5% in less than 4 months while most other stocks were sinking.Our 
research shows that 5 cutting-edge stocks could skyrocket from the exponential increase in demand for 'stay at 
home' technologies. This could be one of the biggest buying opportunities of this decade, especially for those who

Sep 21, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] recently announced that it would reduce its October capacity by a further 20% due to coronavirus-related 
travel restrictions by European Union governments. The airline stated that these travel restrictions, often introduced 
at short notices, were affecting forward bookings.In mid-August, the carrier had already announced plans to slash 
its October capacity by 20%[2] due to a drop in bookings following a surge in coronavirus cases in some European 
Union countries. Back then too, fresh travel restrictions had 'notably weakened' Ryanair's forward bookings.With the 
additional capacity reductions, the Irish low-cost airline now expects its October capacity to decrease from 50% to 
approximately 40% of October 2019 levels. Even at this reduced schedule, the airline anticipates to maintain a load 
factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) of more than 70% in October. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price

Ryanair 
Holdings 
PLC 
price[3] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[4] Ryanair further warned that 'if current trends and EU Governments' 
mismanagement of the return of air travel and normal economic activity continue,' then there might be similar 
capacity cuts in its winter schedule (November-March).With coronavirus concerns continuing unabated, the airline 
is seeing significantly weak travel demand. 
In its recently released August traffic statistics, the carrier reported a 53% year-over-year plunge in traffic to merely 
7 million guests. Ryanair operated approximately 60% of the normal August schedule with a load factor of 73%. On 
a rolling-annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion unit) declined 40% to 88.9 million. Zacks 
Rank &#38; Key Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader 
Transportation[5] sector are Canadian Pacific Railway Limited CP[6], Landstar System Inc LSTR[7] and Knight-
Swift Transportation Holdings Inc KNX[8]. While Canadian Pacific carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Landstar and 
Knight-Swift sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks 
here[9].Shares of Canadian Pacific, Landstar and Knight-Swift have rallied 17.9%, 12.2% and 17.4%, respectively, 
so far this year. Zacks' Single Best Pick to Double From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each picked their 
favorite to gain +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Zacks Director of Research, Sheraz Mian hand-
picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.With users in 180 countries and soaring revenues, it's set to 
thrive on remote working long after the pandemic ends. No wonder it recently offered a stunning $600 million stock

Sep 18, 2020( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  An 
unusual hurricane-like storm has reached Greece, flooding western islands and disrupting aviation. Coastguards 
say a boat carrying 55 migrants is adrift in the poor conditions.Storm Ianos, classed by forecasters as a rare 
hurricane-like "medicane," downed trees and caused flooding and power outages on Greece's Ionian islands on 
Friday, packing winds of up to 117 kilometers (73 miles) per hour.Coastguards said a boat carrying some 55 
migrants was in distress off the Peloponnese peninsula, southwest of Athens, and urged vessels in the area to 
assist.National weather researcher Kostas Lagouvardos on state ERT television cautioned: "We have another 36 
hours of intense conditions ahead of us."Deputy Civil Protection Minister Nikos Hardalias said Ianos was likely to 
"remain west" and then head south, but could still bring heavy rain to the Athens region on Saturday.Read more:

Sep 11, 2020( Coolsmartphone: http://www.coolsmartphone.com Delivered by Newstex)  EE has announced their 
latest report into the changing habits and trends of their customers. It shows how the usage of services and apps 
has changed recently, as lockdown came in and then eased off. 
https://www.coolsmartphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image015.jpg What's perhaps not too surprising, as 
the lockdown restrictions eased some weeks ago, was how traffic to travel and holiday websites more than doubled. 
EE saw sites like Airbnb, Booking.com, EasyJet, Ryanair and Skyscanner getting a big increase in usage and 
requests. This came as people fought to secure holidays and quick getaways in the sun. However, recent 
quarantine and restrictions on gatherings have meant that a lot of potential breaks are now either on hold or 
cancelled. 
https://www.coolsmartphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/andre-hunter-ndyfVMhl8qI-unsplash.jpg 
Likewise, being stuck inside, many online gaming sites like Mr Bet slots[1] have seen a big rise in usage. The 
enforced shut-in has meant that many are turning to digital distractions in greater numbers, with mobile gaming 
studios enjoying a big increase in profits and players enjoying the odd payout via sites like goto syndicate.casino[2]. 
The big increase in leisure time for more than 2bn smartphone owners has meant that gamers have found new 
games, new skills and now there's been a massive increase in mobile advertising revenue too. The massive mobile 
gaming revenues now put PC and console spending firmly in the shade, with smartphones earning developers 
$100bn this year. The advent of 'free to play' games, which allow free entry with in-game purchases earning a 
continual revenue stream for developers, has proved hugely successful with smartphone gamers. 
https://www.coolsmartphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image021.jpg As we exit lockdown and enter a new 
period of restrictions, there's been an explosion of movement in-between. EE tracked smartphones and saw 
customers moving around the UK far more during the May bank holiday and June heatwaves. Previously there was 
a relatively strong adherence to the lockdown measures. Likewise, traffic to fitness apps such as Strava reduced 
massively during the lockdown. Instead - along with gaming - the network saw a big rise in streaming video usage 
on sites like YouTube, Netflix and Prime Video. [ 1]: https://mr.bet/casino/type/slot [ 2]: https://syndicate.casino

Key Reasons for Airline Stocks' Resilience Despite Challenges

Sep 04, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  It is no longer news that 
the Airline industry remains one of the worst-hit corners of the investing space amid the ongoing coronavirus 
pandemic. However, despite the existing challenges, shares of heavyweights like American Airlines AAL[1], Delta 
Air Lines DAL[2], United Airlines UAL[3], Southwest Airlines LUV[4] and Alaska Air Group ALK[5] have appreciated 
14.7%, 21.2%, 14.9%, 23.3% and 16.5%, respectively, over the past month. The Zacks Airline [6]industry also 
increased 17% in the same time frame.This northward movement in stock prices against the backdrop of 
coronavirus-led adversity is certainly heartening. Let's look at the reasons responsible for this uptrend.Improvement 
in Passenger Demand: Though air-travel demand is still trending way below the year-ago levels, there has been a 
slight recovery in it (particularly in leisure demand). For instance, Southwest Airlines management recently stated 
that there was an improvement in demand for August after a lull in July due to the spike in coronavirus cases in 
certain parts of the United States. 
Booking trends for September also showed a modest uptick.That Americans are slowly taking to the skies again is 
reflected in the surging number of passengers screened by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at 
airports. Notably, TSA screened 807,695 passengers last Sunday[7] (Aug 30), marking a huge increase from the 
April 14 figure when only 87,534 people were screened.This significant growth bodes well as we head for the Labor 
Day holiday weekend. The recent updates on cash burn by some carriers are also encouraging. Evidently, Alaska 
Air expects its cash burn to decline to less than $125 million in August from approximately $175 million in 
July.IATA's Promising July Traffic Report: That the improvement is not only limited to the United States is evident 
from the International Air Transport Association's July traffic report[8]. Per the International Air Transport 
Association, passenger demand in July (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs), though down 79.8% 
year over year, improved from June levels when the year over year decline was 86.6%. This positivity can be 
attributed to the impressive performance by the domestic markets of Russia and China.European carriers including 
the likes of Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[9] also witnessed an expansion in July traffic, comparing favorably with the 
June-level owing to easing of restrictions. Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[10]Even though July traffic for the North American 
carriers plunged 94.5% year over year, the same bettered from the 97.1% decline noticed in June.Positive 
Developments on COVID-19 Vaccine: Medical companies across the world are working hard to develop a vaccine 
for the dreaded disease. Favorable vaccine-related updates also contributed to the northbound direction in the 
Key Reasons for Airline Stocks' Resilience Despite Challenges
airline stock prices.Carriers under the aviation industry are hoping that air-travel demand would improve further, 
following more upbeat vaccine-oriented posts. Notably, AstraZeneca recently announced the beginning of a late-
stage study in the United States on its coronavirus vaccine candidate AZD1222, which it is developing in 
partnership with the Oxford University.Airlines Focus on the Upgrade of Safety Measures: In a bid to restore the 
confidence of people in boarding flights, airlines are trying out various ways and means to promote safety. 
Evidently, Delta decided to block the middle seats and limit the number of passengers per flight through at least Jan 
6, 2021.Alaska Airlines decided to make travel almost entirely touch-free in a bid to attract customers. Spirit Airlines 
SAVE[11] also announced multiple safety measures on its flights like the usage of high-efficiency particulate air 
filters that capture 99.97% of particles and filter the surrounding atmosphere of contaminants every three minutes. 
More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple 
sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion 
devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this

Sep 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted disappointing traffic numbers for August, primarily due to weak air travel demand stemming from 
the COVID-19 pandemic. This Ireland-based carrier reported a 53% year-over-year plunge in August traffic to 
merely 7 million guests.Ryanair operated approximately 60% of the normal August schedule with a load factor (% of 
seats filled with passengers) of 73%. On a rolling-annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion 
unit) declined 40% to 88.9 million.Apart from the traffic results, Ryanair was in news recently when it announced 
that it will be cutting capacity by 20%[2] for September and October due to a drop in bookings lately as coronavirus 
cases in some European Union countries increase. The cuts will be focused on countries where the spurt in 
COVID-19 cases resulted in increased travel restrictions by the UK and Ireland.Per a Reuters [3]report, Ryanair will 
trim its workforce less than the original estimate of 3,000. This favorable development followed the decision taken 
by 97% of its pilots and more than 90% of its cabin crew to accept pay cuts as the coronavirus continues to ravage 
the aviation industry by shrinking air-travel demand significantly. 
Zacks Rank &#38; Stocks to Consider Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks 
in the Zacks Transportation [4]sector are Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. KNX[5] , United Parcel Service, 
Inc. UPS[6] and Werner Enterprises, Inc. WERN[7] . Knight-Swift sports a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy), while UPS 
and Werner carry a Zacks Rank #2(Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks 
here.[8]Long-term expected earnings per share (three to five years) growth rate for Knight-Swift, UPS and Werner 
is pegged at 15%, 7.7% and 8.5%, respectively. Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a Generation Be among the early 
investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. 
Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it's expected to create 
22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout 
accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s. Zacks' just-

bitcoin currently costs around 8,000, but if you ask Michael O'Leary, it's dramatically overvalued.The Ryanair chief 
executive has voiced his disapproval of bitcoin, which he likens to a ponzi scheme, and expressed the belief that 
the cryptocurrency is an unsound investment. O'Leary's comments[1] come in the wake of a crypto scam called 
Bitcoin Lifestyle that used a fake endorsement by him to promote the fraud. 
Despite Bitcoin Lifestyle having no connection with bitcoin (BTC) or with O'Leary, it hasn't stopped Ryanair's senior 
exec from taking aim at bitcoin and everything it represents. As anyone who's checked the BTC price chart[2] lately 
will attest, however, bitcoin holds significant value to the millions of people who use it as a store of value, means of 
cross-border exchange, pseudonymous currency, and speculative asset. Bitcoin is up 60% for the year to date and 
many analysts are predicting it to reach new all-time highs within the next 12 months.O'Leary Wouldn't Invest a 
Cent in BitcoinRiled by his likeness being used to flog a knock-off version of bitcoin, O'Leary has vowed 'I have 
never, and would never, invest one cent in Bitcoin, which I believe is equivalent to a Ponzi scheme I would strongly 
advise everyone with any shred of common sense to ignore this false story and avoid Bitcoin like a plague.' 
Ryanair's CEO is one of Ireland's richest men[3] and an entrepreneur whose business acumen speaks for itself. At 
59, however, he is significantly older than the average bitcoin enthusiast, and can be forgiven for failing to 
understand its value proposition. Unfortunately, the first interaction that many British public figures including Michael 
O'Leary, Simon Cowell, Sir Philip Green, Holly Willoughby, Lord Sugar, and Jeremy Clarkson have with bitcoin is 
discovering they've been used to promote crypto scams they have supposedly endorsed and profited from. With a 
net worth of 800 million, O'Leary has no need for speculating in highly volatile crypto assets. He's already made it, 
and thus can afford to be dismissive of bitcoin. He's certainly not the only HNW individual to have written off bitcoin 
out of hand. Billionaire Warren Buffett memorably called[4] bitcoin 'rat poison squared' and his stance on 
cryptocurrencies doesn't appear to have softened, even after attending a charity lunch with several crypto 
influencers including Justin Sun, the founder of the TRON blockchain and cryptocurrency.Where There's Money, 
There's ScammersWhy bitcoin is not, in any classic sense, a ponzi scheme, its meteoric rise in value over the past 
decade has attracted scammers. From Twitter giveaway scams, like the one that saw celebrity accounts 
commandeered by a teenage hacker, to fake news sites promoting Bitcoin Lifestyle with the 'endorsement' of 
Michael O'Leary, scammers have been lured to bitcoin like bees to honey. While their efforts have served to taint 
Bitcoin is worth 8,000 but Ryanair's CEO believes it should be worth zero
bitcoin's name, they haven't diminished the function it was designed for, and which it still faithfully serves: 
uncensorable digital cash for the digital generation. Read more: Bitcoin is worth 8,000 but Ryanair's CEO believes it

Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin BTC[1] every fucking day. Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, 
Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what's been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Marcus Aurelius used to say: 
Yippee!
 Bitcoin priceWe closed the day, August 24 2020, at a price of $11,774. That's a minor 0.95 percent increase in 24 
hours, or $110. It was the highest closing price in three days. We're still 41 percent below Bitcoin's all-time high of 
$20,089 (December 17 2017).Bitcoin market capBitcoin's market cap ended the day at $217,477,962,650. It now 
commands 61 percent of the total crypto market.Bitcoin volumeYesterday's volume of $20,681,511,755 was the 
highest in two days, 9 percent below last year's average, and 72 percent below last year's high.That means that 
yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 334 tons of gold.Bitcoin transactionsA total of 328,984 
transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 2 percent above last year's average and 27 percent below last 
year's high.Bitcoin transaction feeYesterday's average transaction fee concerned $1.58. That's $2.32 below last 
year's high of $3.91.Bitcoin distribution by addressAs of now, there are 18,729 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses 
containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin. Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 4.9 percent of 
the total supply, the top 100 14.2 percent, and the top 1000 34.8 percent.Company with a market cap closest to 
BitcoinWith a market capitalization of $216 billion, Merck &#38; Co has a market capitalization most similar to that 
of Bitcoin at the moment.Bitcoin's path towards $1 millionOn November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John 
McAfee predicted[2] that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020. He even promised to eat his 
own dick if it doesn't. Unfortunately for him it's 97.8 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin's price should have been 
$536K by now, according to dickline.info.Bitcoin energy consumptionOn a yearly basis Bitcoin now uses an 
estimated 67 terawatt hour of electricity. That's the equivalent of Czech Republic's energy consumption.Bitcoin on 
TwitterYesterday 32,820 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That's 60.5 percent above last 
year's average. The maximum amount of tweets per day last year about Bitcoin was 82,838.Most popular posts

Aug 24, 2020( IMD MBA Blog: https://blogs.imd.org/ Delivered by Newstex)  3 lessons from my MBA - IMD MBA 
Blog          We use cookies to offer you the best user experience when accessing our Online Platforms. By your 
continued access, you accept such cookies as well as our Privacy Notice[1] and Cookie Policy[2].    Three key 
learnings from the first 8 months of my MBA: trade-offs, moral compass and respect for opinions.  Disclaimer: all 
photos are taken in pre-COVID time.As we approach the intense job search phase, combined with International 
Consulting Projects, in some ways it feels like the best times of the program are over. 
Together we have all gone through the intense Module 1 and the Module 2 confinement due to COVID. There was 
lots of fun in-and outside of the school. Now, the summer is coming to an end and the focus switches away from 
auditorium activities to more practical, group and individual challenges. As the time flies, I wanted to reflect on my 
key learnings from the MBA program so far.IMD offers a highly comprehensive academic curriculum that includes 
mandatory business disciplines such as Strategy, Accounting, Finance, Economics, Marketing, etc. These classes 
ensure a solid base for solving business problems. However, I do not believe this knowledge helps us to become a 
happier person or a visionary leader, that comes from the other important component of the program - personal 
development.I chose IMD exactly because of this, and I wasn't disappointed. I wanted to know myself better, learn 
to communicate and connect with people better and become more confident. I got all of it. Team CUTS who helped 
me understand myself and others better Here's a selection of 3 key personal takeaways from the program so 
far:1.The theory of trade-offs This concept was introduced for the first time during the Strategy class of Misiek 
Piskorski[3]. Companies make choices that entail a combination of integrated consequences which make other 
choices unavailable. For example, Ryanair does not provide food on board to shorten the time required to clean-up 
the plane after flights. The same applies in our personal lives. MBA participants with families have three key 
activities: studies, family and social time with classmates, but they generally can't have all three of them in full, 
thereby they have to make trade-offs and balance daily.  Misiek Piskorski, Professor of Strategy, gathers curious 
MBAs after class Banal as it may seem, this concept, experienced firsthand got stuck deeply in my head.2.Moral 
compass I picked this idea up from Ralf Boscheck[4], IMD Professor of Economics, when we discussed 
transactional costs. Due to lack of trust, companies spend enormous amounts of money on lawyers to ensure the 
interests of the counterparts are secured. But even that doesn't always guarantee the deal will be beneficial for 
everyone. The solution is to deal with people and organizations that share the same values. Again, seems obvious, 
but eventually it made me ask about the guiding principles of people around me and discuss moral dilemmas - the 
3 lessons from my MBA
best way to understand and find 'your' people. Ralf Boscheck, Professor of Economics, having fun listening to MBA 
presentations  3.Stand up for you opinion but accept that of others I learned this lesson with my start-up group. In 
teamwork it's not about who gets to be right or wrong, as long as each team member has a chance to express 
themself and be heard. Eventually, it is the active presence and contribution that counts, not the winning or losing of 
arguments.Those are my top-3 ideas. And what are yours?Dmitry[5]      If you want to keep reading        Yaroslav 
uses his summer break to reunite with his daughter in Russia and bring her back to Switzerland.         The first half 
of the MBA is now over and we can start preparing for what is yet to come.         Finance in the Summer can be 
spicy and sparkling.         A journey of reflection on self-awareness and leadership by lac Lman.         The final MBA 
application tip of the month. Avoid the stress of last minute problems. Set aside some time in advance, check your 
application, and submit.         The latest Application tips focus more on the essay and interview and the need to tell 
a 
story 
that 
makes 
you 
unique 
and 
compelling.

Aug 24, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per a Reuters report[1], 
European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] will trim its workforce less than the original estimate of 
3,000. This favorable development followed the decision of 97% of its pilots and more than 90% of its cabin crew to 
accept pay cuts as the coronavirus continues to ravage the airline by reducing air-travel demand 
significantly.Notably, management had already warned of taking a stern action by removing one in five of its pilots 
and the cabin crew if they disagree to take lower remuneration by up to 20% under the current scenario. 
Recognizing the gravity of this situation, most pilots and the cabin staff have so far signed deals pertaining to salary 
cuts and work practice changes.In his reaction, Ryanair's director of operations, Neal McMahon said: "We haven't 
finalised the number yet, we originally said there was going to be 3,000 redundancies but we have been able to 
reduce that significantly.'The actual extent of job cuts at the currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Ryanair, however, 
depends on the booking scenario for the upcoming season apart from the degree to which the ongoing global 
health peril disrupts air travel in 2021. Other European carriers like easyJet also cautioned against of job losses as 
air-travel continues to be adversely impacted by the pandemic crisis. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[3].Moving across to the United 
States, the financial aid under the CARES act protects jobs at the airlines only through Sep 30, 2020. However, 
many U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines DAL[4], American Airlines AAL[5] and United Airlines UAL[6] alerted 
employees to the possibilities of lay-offs post the above date as the companies are grappled with the problem of 
overstaffing due to depressed revenues. Just Released: Zacks' 7 Best Stocks for Today Experts extracted 7 stocks

Aug 19, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per a recent Airlines for 
America (A4A) study, the number of air travelers being screened by the Transportation Security Administration 
(TSA) plummeted nationally. On average, there has been a 50% reduction in flight departures with states like New 
York, Hawaii, Washington DC, Vermont, Massachusetts and New Jersey reporting more than 80% decline in the 
TSA checkpoint volumes. Low Traffic The latest total traveler throughput as of Aug 17 was 773,319. Prior to the 
ongoing global health crisis, U.S. airlines were transporting a record 2.5 million passengers and 58,000 tons of 
cargo each day. As travel constraints and stay-at-home orders were implemented, demand for air travel dropped 
sharply. 
In short, the estimated COVID-19-triggered loss outbreak is at least more than $98 billion in the first half of 
2020.Majority of the airline stocks have depreciated over the past week, causing the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to 
decline 5.6% to $55.94, showing that the coronavirus pandemic took a heavy toll on the airline industry.A4A further 
noted that the industry has a long road to recovery ahead. Air travel took three years to rebound from the 9/11 terror 
attacks and more than seven years to see a revival from the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. Market pundits believe 
that it may take at least two years or longer this time for the aviation industry to bounce back to its pre-COVID 
levels.Additionally, the spike in the cases of COVID-19 infection in some European countries will further foil 
passengers' travel plans. Earlier during the week, Germany joined the U.K. in imposing a two-week quarantine on 
flyers returning from Spain.Revenue declines and losses forced some airliners to suspend their dividend payouts 
and seek a relief under bankruptcy protection code. Companies like Alaska Air and Ryanair will be trimming 
respective capacities due to lower forward bookings. Increase in US-China Flight Frequency However, the news by 
The U.S. Transportation Department that U.S. and China agreed to double the number of airline flights between the 
two countries to eight per week bodes well for the concerned industry. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, there were 
more than 300 flights a week between the two countries. But the flight frequency took a hit as demand for 
international air travel dried up.It was announced that United Airlines (UAL) will increase flight services to China to 
four flights per week from San Francisco to Shanghai beginning Sep 4 while Delta Air Lines (DAL) will expand to 
four weekly flights. The deal marks a further easing of a standoff between the world's two biggest economies over 
the pandemic-led travel bans. Government Aid Also, another financial stimulus from the Congress augurs well for 
the airline industry. Possibility of a second airline bailout package strengthened after President Donald Trump 
backed the proposed extension of the Payroll Support Program under the Cares Act. In fact, a group of 16 
Travelers Ebb But China, US Expand Flights: Airlines in Focus
Republicans signed a recently, pleading for another financial relief.Moreover, travel stocks will get a boost as the 
State Department removed the warning on U.S. citizens against traveling abroad Airline Stocks in Focus Though 
travel will remain under pressure, the surge in flight operations to and from China, government grants and a gradual 
resurgence in travel demand put the airline industry on investors' radar to set sights on.Hence we shortlist a few 
stocks, each of which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[1].Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[2] operates low-cost passenger carriers. It 
focuses on linking leisure travelers in small and medium-sized cities to world-class destinations.Though Allegiant 
Travel had an impressive record of dividend payments and share repurchases, it suspended the same following the 
coronavirus threat. The company's efforts to modernize its fleet look impressive, which drive its fuel efficiency in the 
process.I's earnings growth rate for the past five-year period is 12%. Its expected earnings growth rate for the next 
five-year period is 20.9%, higher than the industry average of 10.8%.Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] is an ultra-low 
fare carrier, offering scheduled-passenger airline services in Ireland, the UK, Continental Europe, Morocco and 
Israel. Following months of fleet groundings amid coronavirus concerns, Ryanair resumed operations across 90% 
of its routes in July. Flying schedules are expected to gradually rise to 60% in August and 70% in September. The 
company's cost-cutting measures to combat coronavirus-related adversities are also encouraging.Its earnings 
growth rate for the past five-year period is 3%. Its expected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 
24%, higher than the industry average of 10.8%.Copa Holdings' CPA[4] cost-reduction efforts augur well. The 
airline anticipates to reduce its monthly cash burn to approximately $66 million in the second half of 2020 from $77 
million in the second quarter of 2020.The company is undergoing a fleet upgrade, which will improve its operating 
efficiency.Its expected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 13.6%, higher than the industry average 
of 10.8%. Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit Potential The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond 
$775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases. They're also finding ways to edit 
the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases.Zacks has just released Century of Biology:

Aug 18, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] will be cutting capacity by 20% for September and October due to a drop in bookings lately as 
coronavirus cases in some European Union countries surge. Following this news, shares of the company dipped 
2.4% at the close of business on Aug 17.The cuts will be focused on flights to countries on which travel restrictions 
have been imposed by the United Kingdom and Ireland because of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Moreover, the 
capacity reduction would mostly be in the form of decreased frequency rather than route closures.Re-imposition of 
quarantine rules by United Kingdom and travel restrictions by Ireland have 'notably weakened' Ryanair's forward 
bookings over the last 10 days. The United Kingdom re-imposed quarantine rules on travelers coming from 
countries such as Spain, France and Sweden. Ireland's measures have been regarded as "uniquely restrictive" by 
the airline. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price?icid=chart-RYAAY-
fundamental/price Ryanair Holdings PLC price[2] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[3] It was only last month that the 
carrier resumed operations following months of fleet groundings amid coronavirus concerns. 
The airline is expected to have operated approximately 40% of its normal schedule in July. This Irish low-cost airline 
had planned to gradually increase flying schedules to 60% in August and 70% in September.Passengers affected 
as a result of the capacity cuts in the next two months would be informed of the alternative options they can avail.

Aug 18, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, Azul 
AZUL[1] reported a loss in second-quarter 2020 results. This underperformance was due to weak passenger 
revenues as a result of deteriorating air-travel demand, which emanated from the coronavirus pandemic. Notably, 
another Latin American carrier, Copa Holdings, CPA[2] also posted discouraging second-quarter earnings numbers 
in the previous week[3].On the non- earnings front, Alaska Air Group ALK[4] was the primary newsmaker, courtesy 
of its improved projection for August cash burn compared with July when ticket sales plummeted due to the 
renewed spike in coronavirus cases in the United States. Meanwhile, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] 
trimmed its capacity for both September and October due to the pandemic-induced uncertainty following the rise in 
infected cases in some European countries. 
Recap of the Past Week's Top Stories 1. Azul incurred a loss of $2.38 per share (excluding $2.33 from non-
recurring items) in the second quarter of 2020, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.11. 
However, in the year-ago quarter, the company delivered adjusted earnings of 78 cents per share when air-travel 
demand was strong. Results were affected by the coronavirus-induced drop in demand and a 38% depreciation in 
the Brazilian Real. Also, total revenues of $74.9 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $103.4 million and 
declined 88.9% year over year as well. Further, passenger revenues, accounting for bulk (70.3%) of the top line, 
plummeted 88.6% year over year amid low demand due to coronavirus. Revenues from cargo and other sources 
too decreased 8.5% in the quarter. Consolidated load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) contracted 11.3 
percentage points to 72.8% as the fall in traffic (85.2%) was deeper than the capacity contraction (82.9%) in the 
second quarter.While total revenues per ASK (RASK) dropped 10.3%, passenger revenues per ASK (PRASK) 
plunged 33.6%. Moreover, cost per ASK (CASK) surged in excess of 100%, mainly due to capacity cuts. However, 
fuel price per liter decreased 42% in the June quarter. Also, average fare for the company declined 13.4% from the 
year-ago quarter's figure.Azul exited the second quarter with a passenger operating fleet size of 138 jets. The 
average age of the fleet is 6 years. Contractual passenger fleet size was 165. The company expects to achieve 
roughly 60% of the pre-coronavirus capacity levels by December 2020. For the remainder of this year, Azul 
anticipates a daily cash burn of approximately R$3 million, on average.Azul currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[6]2. Alaska Air anticipates 
its revenues for August to decline in the 70-75% band on a year-over-year basis due to weak demand for air travel. 
Airline Stock Roundup: AZUL 's Q2 Loss, ALK 's Bullish Cash-Burn Update & More
Revenue passengers for August 2020 are also predicted to plunge between 70% and 75% from August 2019 
readings. To combat the bleak demand scenario, Alaska Air is slashing capacity (measured in available seat miles 
or ASMs). ASMs for August are projected to be down nearly 50% from the year-ago levels. Courtesy of higher ticket 
sales, cash burn is projected to improve to less than $125 million in the current month from approximately $175 
million reported last month[7].3. Ryanair will be reducing capacity by 20% for September as well as October due to 
lower forward bookings of late as coronavirus cases in some European countries show a surge. The cuts will be 
focused on countries where the spurt in COVID-19 cases resulted in increased travel restrictions by the UK and 
Ireland. Moreover, the capacity reduction will mostly be felt in the form of decreased flight frequency rather than 
route closures.4 United Airlines UAL[8] is planning to add up to 28 daily non-stop flights to Florida this winter as air-
travel demand seems to be picking up after months of slowdown. The airline intends to add flights from New York, 
NY, Boston, MA and Cleveland, OH to the Florida cities of Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Orlando and Tampa, 
effective Nov 6[9].5. Per a CNBC report[10], American Airlines AAL[11] decided to cancel flights to up to 30 small 
and medium cities in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak-led tepid demand for air travel. The plan to shrink 
services will, however, not materialize before October, 2020. This is because of the fact that per the federal 
assistance to U.S. carriers under the CARES Act, airlines receiving the aid are required to maintain a minimum 
level of service and not lay off any employee through Sep 30. Notably, American Airlines is granted $5.8 billion 
relief package under the scheme. Performance The following table shows the price movement of major airline 
players over the past week and during the past six months.The table above shows that all airline stocks have traded 
in the red over the past week, causing the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to decline 5.2% to $55.34 as coronavirus-
related woes relentlessly hurt the industry. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
has depreciated 50.2%. What's Next in the Airline Space? With the second-quarter 2020 earnings season being 
over for airlines, investors interested in the space will now await the carriers' updates on how to combat the 
coronavirus-induced dismal travel demand. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a 
Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and 
legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early 
investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades

Aug 18, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Irish budget airline Ryanair on 
Monday announced plans to cut capacity by 20% in September and October following a drop in travel demand due 
to a new surge in COVID-19 infections across Europe. The company said in a statement that most of the cuts would 
come from trimming the frequency of flights, and would be focused on flights serving countries such as Spain, 
France and Sweden, which have seen a rise in coronavirus cases. Last month, the airline announced a loss of €185 
million[1] for the first quarter of 2020, which included an almost total grounding of air traffic due to the coronavirus 
pandemic. Ryanair also called on Ireland to ease restrictions on travel from countries where coronavirus infection 
rates are lower than in Ireland. Travelers from countries like Germany and the United Kingdom are obligated to 
quarantine[2] 
for 
14 
days,

though

Aug 14, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  European stocks fell 
on Friday as the UK added six more countries to its 14-day COVID-19 quarantine list.The UK's benchmark FTSE 
100 fell 1.9% and the Euro Stoxx 50 dropped 1.6% in early European trading.The decision, which comes into effect 
Saturday, implies that travellers arriving in the UK from countries including France and the Netherlands have a 
window of a little over 30 hours to return home to avoid restrictions.Data from Eurostat shows Eurozone GDP 
shrank 12% for the second quarter, its sharpest decline since records began in 1995.Visit Business Insider's 
homepage for more stories[1]. European stocks tumbled on Friday after the UK added six more countries[2] to its 
COVID-19 travel quarantine list, which weighed heavily on airline and travel stocks.The decision means that 
travellers arriving in the UK from France, Netherlands, Malta, Monaco, Aruba, and the Turks and Caicos Islands will 
be required to self-isolate for 14 days. Anyone breaking the rules will be liable for a fine.London's benchmark FTSE 
100 fell 1.9%, on course for its biggest one-day fall this month, while the Euro Stoxx 50 fell 1.6%, also set for its 
largest one-day decline this month.Weighing heavily on the European travel industry, the UK's latest restrictions 
"contributed to a moody open for the continent's markets" and "the FTSE continued to unwind its hard-to-justify

Aug 06, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Italy's civil aviation regulator ENAC 
is threatening to ban Ryanair from the country's airports due to non-compliance with rules aimed at tackling the 
coronavirus pandemic. The regulator accused the airline of 'repeated violation' of anti-Covid-19 health measures 
drafted by the Italian government and in force to protect passengers' health. It warned that if 'violations of the rules' 
continue it could prevent Ryanair from flying to or from Italy. Airlines operating in Italy are not required to ensure 
social distancing of one metre if other safety steps such as mandatory wearing of face masks are taken, but ENAC 
said Ryanair is failing to meet these requirements. In a statement, Ryanair rejected the claims as incorrect, and 
insisted it is 'committed to the highest level of safety for our passengers and crew at all times'. The airline restarted 
flying 40% of its schedules[1] across Europe a month ago. 'Ryanair complies fully with the measures set out by the 
Italian government and our customers can rest assured that we are doing everything to reduce interaction on both 
our aircraft and at airports to protect the health of our passengers when flying Ryanair,' the airline said. [ 1]:

Aug 05, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted bland traffic numbers for July, primarily due to weak air travel demand stemming from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. This Irish carrier reported a 70% year-over-year plunge in July traffic to 4.4 million 
passengers.Ryanair operated approximately 40% of the normal July schedule with a load factor (% of seats filled 
with passengers) of 72%. On a rolling annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion unit) declined 
35% to 96.8 million. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price?icid=chart-
RYAAY-fundamental/price Ryanair Holdings PLC price[2] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[3]Apart from the traffic 
results, Ryanair was in the news recently when it reported first-quarter fiscal 2021 (ended Jun 30, 2020) financials. 
The company incurred a loss of 93 cents per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 (ended Jun 30, 2020). As was 
the case with the traffic report, dismal air-travel demand hurt quarterly results. Notably, the carrier regarded the 
fiscal first-quarter as the most challenging in its 35 years of history with EU governments' travel restrictions and 
lockdowns across several nations. More than 99% of the airline's fleet was grounded from mid-March to June-end. 
Quarterly revenues of $137.8 million plunged 94.7% year over year due to massive decline in traffic.Ryanair flying 
schedules are expected to increase in the coming months, with the airline hoping to operate 60% of the usual 
schedule in August and 70% in September. Zacks Rank &#38; Key Picks Ryanair, currently carries a Zacks Rank

Aug 05, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[1], Gol Linhas GOL[2] and SkyWest SKYW[3] reported losses in second-quarter 
2020 results. This underperformance was due to weak passenger revenues as air-travel demand remains subdued 
in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Notably, leading carriers like American Airlines AAL[4] and Southwest 
Airlines LUV[5] also put up a dismal show when it released second-quarter financial numbers in the previous 
week[6].Earnings announcement apart, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[7] traffic data grabbed 
headlines over the past five trading days. Moreover, per a Reuters report[8], U.S. airlines are seeking a six-month 
extension of the payroll support program as the desired rebound in air travel does not seem a near-term possibility. 
Summary of the Past Week's Top Stories 1. Allegiant Travel's second-quarter 2020 loss of $5.96 per share 
(excluding 11 cents from non-recurring items) was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $4.53. 
However, the company reported earnings of $4.33 per share in the year-ago quarter when air-travel demand was 
strong. Meanwhile, with the advent of coronavirus, the same plummeted and hurt second-quarter 2020 results. 
Moreover, quarterly revenues of $133.3 million plunged 72.9% year over year due to soft passenger 
revenues[9].Allegiant Travel presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's 
Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[10]2. Gol Linhas incurred a loss (excluding $1.27 from non-recurring 
items) of 81 cents per share in the second quarter of 2020, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss 
of $1.1. However, net operating revenues of $66.7 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $152.9 million 
and also declined year over year. Further, passenger revenues tanked 91.8% on a year-over-year basis due to 
muted air-travel demand amid coronavirus concerns. The company expects to have liquidity of R$2.9 billion at the 
end of the third quarter. Adjusted net debt is estimated to be R$13.8 billion[11] as of the same period.3. SkyWest's 
second-quarter 2020 loss of 51 cent per share was worse than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of a couple 
of cents. Moreover, quarterly revenues of $350 million tumbled 53% year over year and missed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $352.4 million as well. The COVID-19 outbreak caused a significant reduction in the 
number of scheduled flights[12], thereby hurting the top line.4. Ryanair Holdings posted bland traffic statistics for 
July, primarily due to bleak air-travel demand, stemming from the COVID-19 crisis. This Irish carrier reported a 70% 
year-over-year slump in last month's traffic to merely 4.4 million passengers. Ryanair operated approximately 40% 
of the normal July schedule with a load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) of 72%. On a rolling annual basis, 
total traffic at Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion unit) dropped 35% to 96.8 million.5. With air-travel demand again

drooping following the spike in coronavirus cases across some parts of the United States, United Airlines UAL[13] 
warned that it may have to furlough more pilots than the original plan of 2,250, per a CNBC report[14]. Spirit Airlines 
SAVE[15] too followed suit, having sent notices to its unions about the possibility of some of its pilots, flight 
attendants and other employees getting furloughed in October. Notably, the financial aid under the CARES act 
protects jobs at the airlines only through Sep 30, 2020. Naturally, airlines are planning to extend the period. 
Performance The following table shows the price movement of major airline players over the past week and during 
the past six months. The table above shows that the airline stocks have exhibited a mixed trend with respect to 
price performance in the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined marginally to $51.22. Over the 
course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has plummeted 53.6%. What's Next in the Airline 
Space? Investors will keenly await the updates on airlines' efforts to gain an extension of the U.S. payroll support 
program beyond Sep 30. Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a Generation Be among the early investors in the new type

Jul 29, 2020( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  Spain's 
tourism sector faces ruin following new advisories from Germany and Britain due to a surge in coronavirus cases. 
Spanish resorts are highly dependent on holidaymakers from northern Europe, especially this year.The UK's 
sudden decision on Saturday to enforce a 14-day quarantine on travelers from Spain sent shockwaves through an 
already troubled Spanish tourism sector. Within hours, TUI, Europe's largest travel firm, and budget airline Jet2 
cancelled flights from Britain to mainland Spain for at least two weeks, leaving holidaymakers with little time to 
make alternative arrangements.While TUI's competitors, including Ryanair and EasyJet, say they will maintain their 
flights, the airlines are also believed to have seen widespread cancellations as British travelers say they can't afford 
to miss work and self-isolate for 14 days upon return from their summer vacation. 
Both airlines' share price plummeted close to 10% on Monday following the quarantine announcement. The UK's 
latest travel update went even further, advising against all but essential travel to Spain for the time being.Two days 
later, Germany advised its nationals against non-essential travel to three regions of Spain worst affected by a surge 
in coronavirus cases. The decision applies to Aragon, Navarra and Catalonia — including the popular coastal city of 
Barcelona and the Costa Brava.Read more: Coronavirus latest: 'We have become negligent,' says disease agency 
chiefWhat it means for Spain's tourism sectorSpain's economy is heavily reliant on tourism, which makes up 12% of 
its gross domestic product (GDP). The huge influx of tens of millions of holidaymakers from northern Europe is a 
major economic boost for poorer coastal regions like Andalusia, for which agriculture is the other main earner, and 
where the unemployment rate is the highest in the European Union.Britons make up the largest group of foreign 
tourists to Spain — some 18 million travelled there last year. This week alone, some 600,000 Brits were due to fly to 
Spain, according to estimates from public relations group PC Agency, cited by the Financial Times. Germans, 
meanwhile, are the second largest group — some 11.2 million traveled to the Iberian country in 2019.Tourism is 
also responsible for 11% of jobs in a country with a stubbornly high jobless rate, at more than 15%. Tens of 
thousands of seasonal workers move from northern and rural parts of the country to the eastern and southern 
holiday resorts — as well as the Balearic and Canary islands — during the summer months to pick up work in 
hotels, bars and restaurants.Hundreds of thousands of older Britons and Germans have holiday homes or retire 
along Spain's Mediterranean coast. Their bumper pensions are another huge source of income for regional 
economies. Foreigners have helped Spain's beleaguered property sector to recover in the wake of the crash during 
the 2008/09 financial crisis. Home prices on the coast and the Spanish islands have been increasing faster than the 
rest of the country, according to recent study by property appraisers Tinsa.Read more: Coronavirus in Mallorca:

countries from the coronavirus pandemic, the national and regional governments faced a dilemma over how quickly 
to reopen to international tourists. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez vowed that the country would be ready to 
welcome holidaymakers — at least from Europe — by July 1, but the extent of social distancing rules, which has 
limited the number of customers a restaurant or bar can host, has led many owners of hospitality outlets to question 
whether they should reopen at all.Many of those who have bitten the bullet are barely making ends meet. According 
to research firm Dingus, Spanish hotels had reported that cancellations since the start of the year for July bookings 
had reached 64%. The figures were released even before the new German and British travel warning. Other data 
hints at the trouble facing holidays this summer, showing that occupancy from January to June was just 33% 
compared to 73% last year.Although reports of crowds of Germans and Britons partying on the island of Mallorca 
have hit the headlines due to the lack of social distancing, reports suggest that many usually crowded beach towns 
are eerily quiet.UK travel agencies, meanwhile, have had to heavily discount holidays to Spain to make it 
worthwhile for tourists to self-isolate upon their return. They were already offering 99 (€109, $128) bargains to 
entice people to travel abroad. Those deals will have knock-on effects on the profitability of airlines, hotels and 
transport firms this summer, who have already danced with insolvency during lockdown.Read more: Budapest

Jul 28, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Irish budget airline Ryanair has 
announced a loss of €185 million for the first quarter of 2020, which included an almost total grounding of air traffic 
due to the coronavirus pandemic. The airline said that traffic fell 99%[1] during Q1, and that it expects a smaller loss 
in Q2 as it continues to increase its flying schedule. 
Travel restrictions led to a collapse in the number of travellers, with 500,000 passengers in Q1 compared with 41.9 
million in Q1 of last year. 'It is impossible to predict how long the Covid-19 pandemic will persist', the company said, 
adding that 'a second wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe in late autumn is our biggest fear right now'. The 
carrier also said it expects air travel to be depressed in Europe for the next 2 to 3 years. The United Kingdom 
imposed a 14-day quarantine on travelers arriving from Spain, Norway ordered a 10-day quarantine for people 
returning from the entire Iberian peninsula, and France[2] urged its citizens not to visit Spain's Catalonia region. 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the British quarantine was 'a badly managed overreaction' and that the airline is 
not planning[3] to reduce flying capacity to Spain. [ 1]: https://www.neweurope.eu/article/ryanair-expected-to-halt-

grounded from mid-March to June-end.Quarterly revenues of $137.8 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
of $138.6 million. Moreover, the top line plunged 94.7% year over year due to massive decline in traffic.Ryanair's 
loss after tax came in at €185.1 million in first-quarter fiscal 2021, against profit after tax of €242.9 million in the 
year-ago period. 
Traffic dropped 99% year over year to 0.5 million due to weak travel demand and flight restrictions amid coronavirus 
concerns. Load factor deteriorated to 61% from 96% in first-quarter fiscal 2020.Ancillary revenues fell 97% year 
over year in the reported quarter. The airline's fuel costs declined 99% year over year due to reduced flying amid 
coronavirus-related fleet groundings. Total operating expenses fell 85% year over year. Ryanair, carrying a Zacks 
Rank #3 (Hold), had cash of more than €3.9 billion as of Jun 30, 2020. You can see the complete list of today's

Jul 28, 2020( Phil's Stock World: http://www.philstockworld.com Delivered by Newstex)  Courtesy of ZeroHedge[1] 
View original post here[2].Looking to the week ahead, and just after the biggest two week fall in the Nasdaq (-
2.39%) since the turmoil in mid March, DB's Jim Reid writes that one of the most interesting things this week will be 
earnings releases from Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook (all on Thursday) together with roughly a third of 
the S&#38;P reporting Q2 results. This could have a big impact on sentiment, especially if the tech giant follow Intel 
and disappoint. Intel falling -16.24% on Friday after results the previous night helped tech sentiment dip a little on 
Friday. Digging more into earnings, we have many of the world's biggest companies reporting this week. 
In total, releases include 190 from the S&#38;P 500 and a further 169 from the STOXX 600. Among the releases 
include SAP, Ryanair and LVMH today. Then tomorrow we'll hear from Starbucks, Visa, McDonald's, Pfizer, 
Peugeot and Nissan. Wednesday will see Sanofi, Rio Tinto, GlaxoSmithKline, Qualcomm, PayPal, Boeing, 
Santander, General Electric, General Motors, Barclays and Nomura release earnings. After that, Thursday's 
releases include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Samsung, Nestle, Procter &#38; Gamble, Comcast, L'Oreal, 
Stanley Black &#38; Decker, AstraZeneca, Linde, Mastercard, American Tower, AB InBev, Total, Volkswagen, 
Ford, Royal Dutch Shell, Lloyds Banking Group and Credit Suisse. Finally on Friday, there's Chevron, Charter 
Communications, Merck, AbbVie, Phillips 66, ExxonMobil, BNP Paribas, Caterpillar, Nokia, NatWest Group and Fiat 
Chrysler 
Automobiles.https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-
images/weekly%20earnings%20july%2027.png?itok=ed9mwhKm Elsewhere one of the key macro highlights this 
week will be the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision, along with Chair Powell's subsequent press 
conference. Recent communications from the Fed have made it clear that the FOMC will soon pivot away from 
stabilization towards accommodation, and in a piece earlier this week, DB's economists released the first of a two 
part series looking at how much accommodation will be needed and how it will be provided. On Friday, Reid 
published a CoTD to suggest that if balance sheet was the only tool used, to keep policy neutral an extra 12 trillion 
of QE could be required. We are currently at $7tn. Data releases will also get a decent amount of attention, 
particularly given the Q2 GDP releases out in the US (Thursday) and the Euro Area (Thursday/Friday) that are likely 
to show some of the largest quarterly contractions in history. They will also help calibrate forecasts for economists 
going forward. The other main data release will be the release of PMIs from China on Friday. All the other data 
releases will be in the day by day calendar at the end. A day-by-day calendar of key global events is below courtesy

looking at just the US, the key event this week is the July FOMC meeting, with the release of the statement at 2:00 
PM ET on Wednesday followed by Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 PM. The key economic data releases 
this week are the durable goods report on Monday, the initial Q2 GDP estimate on Thursday, and the personal 
income and spending and UMich consumer sentiment reports on Friday.https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-
images/weekly%20july%2027.jpg?itok=wV6CPJ3- Monday, July 27 08:30 AM Durable goods orders, June 
preliminary (GS +2.0%, consensus +7.0%, last +15.7%); Durable goods orders ex-transportation, June preliminary 
(GS +2.0%, consensus +3.5%, last +3.7%); Core capital goods orders, June preliminary (GS +1.0%, consensus 
+2.4%, last +1.6%); Core capital goods shipments, June preliminary (GS +1.0%, consensus +2.8%, last +1.5%): 
We expect durable goods orders to increase 2.0% in the preliminary June report, reflecting cancellations in aircraft 
orders. We expect a 1.0% increase in core capital goods orders, given the elevated level in May relative to other 
industrial data series. 10:30 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity, July (consensus -4.9%, last -6.1%) Tuesday, 
July 28 09:00 AM S&#38;P/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, May (GS +0.4%, consensus +0.30%, last 
+0.33%); We estimate the S&#38;P/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index increased by 0.4% in May, following a 
0.33% increase in April. 10:00 AM Conference Board consumer confidence, July (GS 94.0, consensus 94.4, last 
98.1); We estimate that the Conference Board consumer confidence index declined by 4.1pt to 94.0 in July, as the 
deteriorating virus situation could weigh on confidence. 10:00 AM Richmond Fed Manufacturing, July (consensus 5, 
last 0) Wednesday, July 29 08:30 AM Advance goods trade balance, June (GS -$76.0bn, consensus -$75.1bn, last 
-$74.3bn); We estimate that the goods trade deficit increased to $76.0bn in June due to a larger rebound in goods 
imports than in goods exports. 08:30 AM Wholesale Inventories, June preliminary (consensus -0.3%, last -1.2%) 
10:00 AM Pending home sales, June (GS +22.0%, consensus +14.5%, last +44.3%); We estimate that pending 
home sales increased by 22.0% in June based on regional home sales data, following a 44.3% surge in May. We 
have found pending home sales to be a useful leading indicator of existing home sales with a one-to-two-month lag. 
02:00 PM FOMC statement, July 28-29 meeting; As discussed in our FOMC preview, major policy changes are 
unlikely at the July meeting. We now expect the FOMC to complete its framework review in September and to then 
change its forward guidance and asset purchase policies in November, a one meeting delay compared to our 
previous expectations. Thursday, July 30 08:30 AM GDP, Q2 advance (GS -29.0%, consensus -35.0%, last -5.0%); 
Personal consumption, Q2 advance (GS -34.5%, consensus -34.5%, last -6.8%): We estimate a 29% drop in the 
initial release of Q2 GDP (qoq ar). Our forecast reflects a 34.5% annualized drop in personal consumption related 
to the coronavirus lockdowns. We also expect very large declines in structures investment (-25%) and equipment 
investment (-44%). Despite the large expected GDP decline, we believe economic reality during the quarter was 
even worse, with a first-print bias from incomplete source data and survey non-response worth roughly +4pp 
(implying a true GDP growth rate of around -33%). We will finalize our GDP forecast after Wednesday morning's 
trade balance and inventory data. 08:30 AM Initial jobless claims, week ended July 25 (GS 1,400k, consensus 
Key Events In The Coming Week: Peak Earnings, Fed And GDP
1,450k, last 1,416k); Continuing jobless claims, week ended July 18 (consensus 16,200k, last 16,197k); We 
estimate initial jobless claims declined but remain elevated at 1,400k in the week ended July 25. Friday, July 31 
08:30 AM Personal income, June (GS +0.5%, consensus -0.6%, last -4.2%); Personal spending, June (GS +5.6% 
consensus +5.4%, last +8.2%); PCE price index, June (GS +0.39%, consensus +0.5%, +0.10%); Core PCE price 
index, June (GS +0.22%, consensus +0.2%, last .10%); PCE price index (yoy), June (GS +0.81%, consensus 
+0.9%, last +0.55%); Core PCE price index (yoy), June (GS +0.98%, consensus +1.0%, last +1.02%): Based on 
details in the PPI, CPI, and import price reports, we forecast that the core PCE price index rose by 0.22% month-
over-month in June, corresponding to a 0.98% increase from a year earlier. Additionally, we expect that the 
headline PCE price index increased by 0.39% in June, corresponding to a 0.81% increase from a year earlier. We 
expect a 0.5% increase in personal income in June and a 5.6% increase in personal spending. 08:30 AM 
Employment cost index, Q2 (GS +0.5%, consensus +0.6%, prior +0.8%): We estimate that the employment cost 
index rose 0.5% in Q2 (qoq sa), reflecting the sharp rise in unemployment and our finding that composition effects 
drove most or all of the acceleration in other wage measures. 09:45 AM Chicago PMI, July (GS 43.0, consensus 
44.0, last 36.6): We estimate that the Chicago PMI increased by 6.4pt to 43.0 in July—following a 4.3pt increase in 
June—partly reflecting the index's low level relative to other manufacturing surveys. 10:00 AM University of 
Michigan consumer sentiment, July final (GS 72.7, consensus 72.8, last 73.2): We expect University of Michigan 
consumer sentiment to edge 0.5pt lower from the preliminary estimate for July, in which the index declined 4.9pt. 
The report's measure of 5- to 10-year inflation expectations increased by two-tenths to 2.7% in the preliminary 
report. Source: DB, BofA, Goldman [ 1]: http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/x4pgYO3iYR4/key-

Jul 07, 2020( evo: http://www.evo.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  When giving the backstory to taking his favourite 
image of a 550 Maranello[1] for our 'Life Through A Lens: The Italian Jobs' feature, Gus Gregory touches upon the 
magic of working in Italy. In talking to him for that quote I was reminded of what a huge part Italy has played in both 
our lives, and in the success of this magazine. For a golden period Gus and I would be in Italy at least once a 
month, sometimes to attend press launches (either as invitee or covert interlopers parked round the corner in a rival 
car), but often for drive stories I'd arranged.If we travelled by plane these trips would tend to follow the same 
routine: a horrendously early flight to Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport (which is actually on the outskirts of 
Bologna), or if we couldn't slip a couple of BA tickets by Harry Metcalfe's hawk-eyed scrutiny, a Ryanair flight to 
Bologna Forl, 60 miles from the city. To be honest, it didn't really matter. 
We were heading to Italy to shoot something fast and exotic, so life was good. Naturally enough, Ferrari often 
formed the basis of these missions, but we would also be regular visitors to Maserati[2], Lamborghini and Pagani[3]. 
Wherever we went we could expect a warm welcome, but we also knew the car probably wouldn't be ready, or 
there would be some confusion over our arrival date, or perhaps a paperwork issue. It would all come good in the 
end, but only after a bit of arm-flailing and a PR representative shouting 'Dai! Dai!' at somebody (or possibly 
nobody) down their mobile phone. I've never learned to speak Italian, but loitering in assorted supercar factory 
reception areas waiting for cars soon taught me that 'dieci minuti' actually means at least three quarters of an hour

815bhp twin-turbocharged V12[4]My first visit to Lamborghini[5] predates evo, but only by a few years, when I went 
to drive the Diablo VT Roadster[6]. These were the pre-Audi[7] days and the factory was just as I imagined, with its 
distinctive 1960s architecture and quaint production lines that looked much like the black and white archive images 
I'd seen of Espadas[8] and Countaches[9] in the books and magazines I devoured as a kid. The car was epic, if 
somewhat unwieldy, but the best part by far was being shown around it by legendary test driver Valentino Balboni. 
Some years later I would spend the day with him in a Miura SV[10], hooning through the Apennine Mountains. Even 
as I type that statement it still seems like it must have been a dream.Those roads, in particular the Futa and 
Raticosa passes, became our playground. Countless times Gus and I would grab a car from Maranello or 
Sant'Agata and absolutely gun it for 70 miles down the A1 autostrada, knowing that although we were burning 
precious time getting there, we would be in a driver's and photographer's paradise once we arrived. Inevitably we 
would spend too long up in the hills and have to drive back at speeds more suited to Moss and Jenks in the '55 
'Driving a new Ferrari on those glorious roads was to feel like we had been given the keys to a kingdom'
Mille Miglia to make our flight home or get to the Ristorante Bounty in San Cesario sul Panaro before it closed to 
guzzle a cold Peroni and the world's thinnest pizza diavola.Gus describes those times as the days when we were 
kings. Not out of arrogance, but because to drive a brand new Lamborghini or Ferrari on those glorious, deserted 
roads was to feel like we had been given the keys to a kingdom. Our job was to bring back the best images and 
experiences so we might share them with you.Back then we were just as likely to drive out to Italy as we were to fly. 
I know we're all experiencing wanderlust right now, but just thinking about driving to Italy fills me with joy. All 
continental road trips have an occasion to them, but few hold more fond memories than the run down through 
France, up and over the St Gotthard Pass, before charging down towards the Italian Lakes and spearing across the 
fertile, crop-laden plains of Reggio Emilia to Supercar Valley.Of these glory days three trips stand out. The first was 
in a Jaguar XKR[11] (evo 014), three-up (myself, Gus and friend of evo John Hayman) with all Gus's camera gear 
and no room for spare clothes. We drove there on Friday afternoon, arrived at the Maserati factory at 6am 
Saturday, grabbed a couple of hours' sleep before taking a 3200GT [12]away to conduct a twin test, returned it to 
the factory late that afternoon and then drove straight back to the UK in one hit.The second is driving to Maranello 
in a Viper GTS[13]. Again on a Friday, again non-stop, this time accompanied by photographer Andy Morgan. For 
reasons best known to myself, I drove the whole way, experiencing fatigue-induced HunterS Thompson-style 
hallucinations along the way. It was worth it to join the rest of the evo team on 'The Devil's Playground' supercars 
test for issue 022.And the third? Driving to Tuscany and Umbria via Lake Como for my honeymoon. All of which 
goes to prove if you have a drop of petrol in your veins then it figures you also have Italy in your 
heart.Advertisement - Article continues below [ 1]: https://www.evo.co.uk/ferrari/california/13351/a-z-supercars-

Jul 07, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, United 
Airlines UAL[1] grabbed headlines following its announcement that its schedule for August will be thrice its June 
capacity. This decision came in line with the recent uptick in air traffic in the United States despite a second-wave 
spurt in coronavirus cases. Notably, owing to this recovery in domestic travel demand, American Airlines AAL[2] 
lifted the booking cap on its flights from Jul 1, as mentioned in the previous week's write up[3].However, with 
international travel demand continuing to be soft on a year-over-year basis, American Airlines expects to reduce the 
long-haul international capacity by 25% during summer 2021. Meanwhile, the European low-cost carrier Ryanair 
Holdings RYAAY[4] too was in news as it offered an upbeat forecast for July air-travel demand. Per a Reuters 
report[5], the airline expects to carry more than 4.5 million passengers on its flights in the month. 
Even though the above reading marks a 70% decline from the actual number of passengers flown in last July, the 
same represents a marked improvement from the coronavirus-ravaged months of April and May.Recap of the Past 
Week's Most Important Stories1. United Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), plans to add nearly 
25,000 flights in August, triple the size of its June schedule, as air travel demand (especially leisure travel demand) 
improves steadily. With this, the carrier will fly about 40% of its August 2019 schedule.On the international front, 
United Airlines will fly about 25% of its August 2019 schedule.[6]You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[7]2. Ryanair reported a 97% year-over-year plunge in June traffic to merely 0.4 
million guests. As wide-spread travel restrictions are still in place, the carrier's LaudaMotion unit in Austria did not 
carry any passenger during the month. Nevertheless, in response to the recent rise in demand, the unit reopened 
on Jul 1.Ryanair operated 2800 scheduled flights in June with 95% arriving on time. On a rolling annual basis, total 
traffic at Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion unit) declined 27% to 107.2 million.[8]3. Apart from trimming 
international capacity for next summer, American Airlines plans to discontinue services to several leisure 
destinations that it expects will show reduced demand trends. Evidently, the airline will terminate three trans-Atlantic 
routes from Charlotte Douglas International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport. Additionally, it will cease 
operations on five underperforming routes from Los Angeles International Airport to destinations in Asia and South 
America. In a bid to lend customers a flexible booking experience, the carrier extended its change fee waiver for 
new tickets to be booked through Jul 31, 2020[9].4. JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU[10] and its pilots union inked 
a deal to avoid involuntary furloughs until May 1, 2021 according to a CNBC report[11]. Although the details of the 
Airline Stock Roundup: UAL 's Bullish View for August Schedule, RYAAY in Focus
agreement remained undisclosed, the union agreed on not changing any pay rates.5. With the coronavirus 
pandemic affecting air-travel demand severely, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL[12] did not operate regular 
international flights during June. Its total monthly traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), tanked 
88% on a year-over-year basis. With Gol Linhas lowering capacity in response to dwindling demand, total monthly 
capacity (measured in available seat miles) contracted 87.4%Moreover, consolidated load factor (% of seats filled 
by passengers) fell to 79.1% from 83% a year ago. Load factor declined as the fall in traffic was more than capacity 
contraction. Gol Linhas' total monthly departures slumped 86.9% and seats plummeted 87.9%.However, with air-
travel demand improving on the domestic front, domestic demand soared 95.4% from the level witnessed in May 
2020. Additionally, domestic supply in June surged 84.8% on a month-on-month basis.PerformanceThe following 
table shows the price movement of major airline players over the past week and during the past six months.The 
table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the green in the past week as air traffic continues to 
display an uptrend despite the spike in COVID-19 cases across the United States. This upside led the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index to inch up 1.7% to $55.06. However, over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index has depreciated 17.3%.What's Next in the Airline Space?June traffic reports from the likes of Allegiant Travel 
Company ALGT[13] will be awaited by investors in the coming days.Zacks' Single Best Pick to DoubleFrom 
thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each picked their favorite to gain +100% or more in months to come. From 
those 5, Zacks Director of Research, Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.This 
young company's gigantic growth was hidden by low-volume trading, then cut short by the coronavirus. But its 
digital products stand out in a region where the internet economy has tripled since 2015 and looks to triple again by 
2025. Its stock price is already starting to resume its upward arc. The sky's the limit! And the earlier you get in, the

Jul 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted bland traffic numbers for June, primarily due to weak air travel demand stemming from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. This Irish carrier reported a 97% year-over-year plunge in June traffic to merely 0.4 million 
guests. As wide-spread travel restrictions are still in place, the carrier's LaudaMotion unit in Austria did not carry 
any passenger during the month. 
Nevertheless, in response to recent rise in demand, this Austria-based unit has reopened from Jul 1.Ryanair 
operated 2800 scheduled flights in June with 95% of them arriving on time. On a rolling annual basis, total traffic at 
Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion unit) declined 27% to 107.2 million. Load factor (% of seats filled with 
passengers) was 95% on a rolling annual basis.Owing to certain travel relaxations and air travel demand gradually 
increasing, this European low-cost carrier expects to carry more than 4.5 million passengers on its flights in July, 
per Reuters report[2]. Thereby, we expect its July traffic numbers to sharply rise from May and June readings.In 
response to the recent rise in demand, American Airlines AAL[3] has started to book its flights to full capacity from 
Jul 1 and Delta Air Lines DAL[4] expects to expand capacity by about 1,000 flights in both July and August. Both 
American Airlines and Delta carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks Rank &#38; A Key PickRyanair currently carries a

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-pilots-agree-to-20-pay-cut-in-attempt-to-limit-job-losses/Ryanair pilots 
have agreed to take a 20% pay cut as part of efforts to avoid up to 3,000 job cuts at Europe's biggest budget 
airline.The pilots' union Balpa announced on Wednesday that 96% of its Ryanair members had voted to accept the 
temporary pay cut in order to 'save jobs that were under threat' due to the collapse in demand for flights in the face 
of the coronavirus pandemic. 'This is a terrible time for aviation and for employees in all airlines,' Brian Strutton, 
Balpa's general secretary said. 
'It was our members' mandate for us to save as many jobs as possible[1]. In the circumstances this is the right thing 
to do even if it means accepting difficult temporary reductions in pay.' The pilots agreed to the pay cut deal hours 
after Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, made public an ultimatum that a total of 3,000 job losses could 
only be avoided if all staff agreed to pay cuts. The deal with Ryanair's pilots saves 260 jobs that were at risk. 
Ryanair had said a total of 330 pilot jobs were at risk. Negotiations with cabin crew and other staff continue, lower 
paid cabin crew have been asked to sacrifice 5% of their pay. Earlier on Wednesday, O'Leary had said: 'We've 
already announced about 3,000 job losses but we're engaged in extensive negotiations with our pilots, our cabin 
crew and we're asking them to all take pay cuts as an alternative to job losses. 'We're looking from 20% from the 
best-paid captains, 5% from the lowest-paid flight attendants and we think if we can negotiate those pay cuts by 
agreement, we can avoid most but not all job losses.' 'Pilots have agreed to accept a 20% pay reduction in order to 
save 260 of the jobs that were at risk, with most of the rest linked to the possible base closures which is still to be 
resolved. We will remain in negotiations with the airline about those jobs and aim to protect those too.' The union 
said Ryanair had agreed that pay will be restored to 100% over the next four years. Strutton added: 'We do not 
relish accepting pay cuts and this is going to be tough for many of our pilot members. But we are at least pleased to 
have ensured that the overwhelming number of pilots whose jobs were at risk will continue to be employed.' 
O'Leary, who is chief executive of Ryanair's holding company, initially took a 50% cut to his pay in April and May, 
and has extended this for this financial year until the end of March 2021. On Wednesday, Ryanair began a 'big 
ramp-up' of its schedule to 1,000 fights a day. Eddie Wilson, who is chief executive of the group's main airline, said: 
'At Ryanair we are doing everything we can to return to flying, so we can reunite friends and family, allow people to 
return to work and begin to restart Europe's tourism industry, upon which millions of jobs, especially for young 
people, now depend.' Ryanair has refused a Welsh government request to postpone flights scheduled to arrive in

Cardiff starting on Friday, due to concerns that passengers could bring the coronavirus with them into Wales. A 
flight from Mlaga is due to land at the airport on Friday morning, and another from Faro, Portugal, on Friday 
evening. A Ryanair spokesman said: 'We are operating normally on 3 and 4 July with hundreds of Welsh people 
travelling home from countries with lower 'R rates' than the UK.' A Welsh government spokesperson said: 'We don't 
believe these flights should be going ahead.' People in Wales have been asked to stay local, within five miles, as 
guidance. On Tuesday, easyJet said it planned to make as many as one in three of its pilots redundant. The airline 
plans to cut up to 727 pilot jobs and up to 1,200 cabin crew posts across the UK. EasyJet started consultations with 
unions in the UK on Tuesday after announcing last month that it would be making about 4,500 staff redundant 
across Europe. It also plans to close its bases at Stansted, Southend and Newcastle airports. On Wednesday, 
easyJet said it planned to reduce the number of aircraft and employees based in Berlin and had launched a 
consultation with unions. 'Although we will remain Berlin's largest carrier, we have to adjust our schedule to reflect 
the demand following the pandemic and focus on profitable flying,' the chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said. Read

UK-based flight and cabin crew are set to be laid off by Easyjet as the short-haul airline also moves to close its 
bases at Stansted, Southend and Newcastle airports.Easyjet said in May that it would be cutting 4,500 jobs across 
Europe, a 30 per cent reduction in its workforce, in response to its fears that travel restrictions and passenger 
demand around the pandemic will mean poor trading conditions for the next two years at least. 
Of those job cuts, 727 will be UK-based pilots and another 1,300 cabin crew serving passengers in flight. It is the 
largest operator at Gatwick, Manchester and Luton, Britain's second, third and fifth largest airports. It will withdraw 
its seven planes from Stansted, the UK's fourth largest airport, dominated by rival Ryanair; its four planes at 
Southend, a serious blow to the aspirations of the Essex airport; and its three aircraft at Newcastle, reducing choice 
at one of Britain's top ten regional airports. 'The lower-demand environment means we need fewer aircraft and have 
less opportunity for work for our people,' Johan Lundgren, Easyjet's chief executive, said. Unite, the aviation union, 
described the announcement as yet another 'massive blow' for the industry. The union questioned Easyjet's 
decision to make workers redundant given the company took a 600 million loan from the government and recently 
paid a 174 million dividend to shareholders. Oliver Richardson, Unite national officer for civil aviation, said: 'The 
announcement further demonstrates why it is absolutely essential that the government extends its job retention 
scheme for the aviation sector, which has been one of the industries worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.' It has 
emerged that Easyjet's founder and largest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, has seen his and his family's 
interests fall to below 30 per cent. The billionaire previously spoke for about a third of the airline's shares. That 
triggered the ending of a 'relationship agreement', a stock market listing scheme designed to regulate the 
relationship between a leading shareholder and a quoted company. It does not affect the commercial agreements 
under which Sir Stelios is paid royalties for the airline to use the Easyjet brand. Read more: Easyjet to close Essex

Jul 01, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With air-travel demand 
returning gradually, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] offered a rosy forecast with respect to 
the same for July. Per a Reuters report[2], the airline expects to carry more than 4.5 million passengers on its flights 
in the month. Even though the above reading marks a 70% decline from the actual number of passengers flown in 
last July, the same represents a marked improvement from the coronavirus-ravaged months of April and May. 
In fact we expect the June traffic numbers — to be released shortly — to sharply rise from the April and May 
readings.Moreover, Ryanair expanded its flight schedule to meet the anticipated increase in July traffic. Evidently, 
this presently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier aims to restore almost 90% of its routes from today. However, the 
routes will have fewer flights in operation than normal. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here.[3]As part of the strengthened flight network, Ryanair opened more than 60 routes to/from 
Austria beginning today. Further, the Vienna A320 base of Ryanair's Austrian unit, Laudamotion, reopened 
today.Apart from Ryanair, its counterparts in the United States, namely American Airlines AAL[4] and United 
Airlines UAL[5] are boosting their capacity. Both stocks currently carry the same Zacks Rank as Ryanair. Key PickA 
better-ranked stock in the broader Transportation [6]sector is Scorpio Tankers STNG[7], holding a Zacks Rank #2 
(Buy) at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Scorpio Tankers' current-year earnings has been revised 55% 
upward in the past 60 days.Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new 
type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will 
soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it's expected to create 22 million jobs and 
generate $12.3 trillion in activity.A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new 
tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s. Zacks' just-released special report

Jul 01, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair could slash 3,000 jobs if it 
cannot agree pay cuts with pilots and cabin crew, the airlines CEOMichael O'Leary said on Wednesday. 'We've 
already announced about 3,500 job losses but we're engaged in extensive negotiations with our pilots, our cabin 
crew and we're asking them to all take pay cuts as an alternative to job losses,' O'Leary told BBC TV. Back in May, 
the Irish budget carrier had warned[1] it might need to cut 3,000 jobs, accounting for around 15% of its staff, 'as a 
direct result of the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis'. The airline's restructuring and job cuts would commence from 
July 2020, with Ryanair currently being in pay negotiations with its staff. 'We're looking for 20% from the best paid 
captains, 5% from the lowest paid flight attendants and we think if we can negotiate those pay cuts by agreement, 
we 
can 
avoid 
most 
but 
not 
all 
job 
losses,' 
Ryanair's 
boss 
added.

Jun 23, 2020( Free Movement: http://www.freemovement.org.uk Delivered by Newstex)  In the case of C‑754/18[1] 
Ryanair the Court of Justice of the European Union has concluded that a non-EU national who holds a permanent 
residence card from one EU state, is under EU law, exempt from any domestic law requirement to hold a visa to 
enter anotherEU state. The judgment effectively overrules the Court of Appeal judgment in Ryanair v Secretary of 
State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 899[2] (see our write up of that earlier case here: Carriers' 
liability: Ryanair challenges the Secretary of State - and loses[3]). The CJEU reaches this conclusion despite there 
being no express provision to this effect in Directive 2004/38: only a residence card is specifically mentioned. 
This was no barrier to the CJEU, which considered it absurd and counterproductive for one of the benefits of a 
residence card to be lost when the status is upgraded to permanent residence.  The court also finds that other 
member states must accept a permanent residence card issued in a different member state as proof that status is 
genuinely held. This runs contrary to the current Home Office interpretation of the significance of possessing 
residence documentation issued in EU countries. The judgment is an important one for airlines and for passengers, 
given that carrier liability laws were until now effectively forcing airlines to deny boarding to non-EU family members 
with 
permanent 
residence 
cards 
and 
no 
visa.

Airlines LUV[3], United Airlines UAL[4] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5].Here are highlights from Wednesday's 
Analyst Blog: Airline Industry Soars 50%+ in a Month: More Room to Rally?After being on the receiving end of the 
pandemic crisis that bottled-up air-travel demand, stocks in the airline space finally have something to cheer about. 
Recently, many aviation stocks issued bullish updates on the back of an improved air-travel demand scenario. The 
buoyancy is evident from the fact that the ZacksAirline[6]industry has gained 50.8% in the past month compared 
with the S&#38;P 500 Index's mere 3.8% rise.Reasons for This ResurgenceReopening of businesses in countries 
around the globe and easing of travel bans bode well for the airline stocks, which are witnessing a surge in new 
bookings. Evidently, American Airlines saw 60% growth in July bookings on a year-over-year basis.Management at 
American Airlines stated that it intends to operate 55% of its scheduled domestic flights in July 2020 compared with 
the capacity recorded in July 2019. Evidently, the company flew nearly 110,000 passengers per day, on average, in 
the last week of May, up 71% from the April reading. Moreover, American Airlines aims to operate nearly 20% of its 
internal flights scheduled for July compared with the last-year level.Also, owing to the recent uptick in air-travel 
demand alongside cost-cutting initiatives, the carrier projects its cash-burn rate to fall to nearly $40 million per day 
in June from $100 million in April. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company hopes to reduce its cash-burn rate to 
zero by Dec 31, 2020. Delta Air Lines too expects to lower its average daily cash outflow to zero by 2020 end. 
Moreover, this Atlanta, GA-based carrier predicts the demand-recovery landscape to be healthier on the domestic 
front than in the international markets. As a result, it added 100 domestic flights in June.Moreover, the company 
plans to continue extending the flight fleet in the third quarter. Further, Southwest Airlines boosted itsJune schedule 
by 27%[7]from the May reading. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks 
here[8].Additionally, the cost-controlling initiatives of airlines are supporting bottom-line growth in the current 
environment of depressed revenues. Evidently, owing to its cost-saving measures, United Airlines expects second-
quarter operating expenses to decrease 53% year over year.Another factor working in favor of the airlines in this

Ryanair
otherwise economic gloom is their focus on operating cargo-only flights. Understandably, the cargo business unit of 
Latin American carrier Azul registered a 36% increase in first-quarter 2020 revenues. Backed by its concentration 
on cargo-only flights to offset passenger revenue weakness, United Airlines expects the same to surge more than 
30% year over year in the June quarter.Therelaxation of restrictions[9]on flights connecting the United States with 
China is another positive. Notably, the likes of Delta and United Airlines aim to resume operations on the U.S.-
China routes shortly.The Road AheadAlthough the recent rally in airline stocks owing to the above-mentioned 
tailwinds looks impressive, the million-dollar question is whether this uptick is sustainable. Fears over a second 
wave of coronavirus are a major headwind. In fact, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings' CEO Michael 
O'Leary recently stated that even though he expects the carrier to be profitable in fiscal 2022 (ending Mar 31, 
2022), 'Everything will depend on how people will fly between September and March and that there is no second-
wave outbreak'.However, one thing is certain that demand will not rebound to pre-coronavirus levels anytime soon. 
Per the International Air Transport Association[10](IATA), the aviation industry is estimated to suffer loses to the 
tune of $84.3 billion in the current year due to the coronavirus woes.However, the forecast seems brighter for 2021 
with total loss for the industry likely to be narrower at $15.8 billion.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it 
generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed 
investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of money for 
regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend  > >[11]Media

Jun 18, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  French finance minister Bruno Le 
Maire on Thursday urged Air France not to make mandatory job cuts. Le Maire said he wished that any job losses 
at Air France represent less than 8,000 posts: 'Readjustments will be necessary for Air France. What I am asking of 
Air France is that there should be no forced redundancies', he said. His comments come amid media reports that 
the airline was planning to cut more than 8,000 jobs, based on voluntary departures. In April, Air France received €7 
billion in French government aid. CEO Ben Smith in May announced a 20% cut to structural capacity, which 
potentially affects some 9,000 of its 45,000 jobs. Other airlines are reducing staff as well amid the coronavirus 
crisis. British Airways is cutting 12,000 jobs, Ryanair is cutting at least 3,000, while Lufthansa is seeking as many as 
22,000 departures.

Jun 17, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  British airline EasyJet said it had 
pushed back the delivery of 24 aircraft to between 2025 and 2027 because of the coronavirus crisis. The airline 
earlier said it is not expecting travel demand to recover to its pre-crisis levels until 2023. The company employed 
15,000 people at the beginning of the year. In May it needed to cut 4,500 jobs, or 30% of its workforce[1]. It has 
also secured additional flexibility on orders from planemaker Airbus as part of its planning for a smaller travel 
market. The deal gives EasyJet the option to cancel up to seven aircraft currently scheduled for delivery between 
2022 and 2026. In March, the airline grounded its entire fleet[2] as a response to the global travel bans aimed at 
containing the coronavirus pandemic. On Monday, its planes started flying a minimal service. Last month, the UK 
government announced that, from June 8, all international arrivals, including returning Britons, will have to self-
isolate and provide details of where they will be staying. The aviation industry condemned the move[3]. EasyJet, 
together with Ryanair and British Airways, has written to the government applying for a judicial review, complaining 
that the quarantine rules are disproportionate. [ 1]:

Jun 16, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
American Airlines AAL[1] grabbed headlines following the announcement that it hopes to reduce its cash burn rate 
to zero by Dec 31, 2020. Notably, the carrier was also in news in the previous week[2] when it issued a bullish 
update on July capacity.Per Delta Air Lines DAL[3] management, the second-quarter 2020 top line is expected to 
plunge 90% year over year, mainly due to the coronavirus-induced passenger revenue slump. Echoing similar 
sentiments, United Airlines UAL[4] anticipates an 88% year-over-year reduction in second-quarter total 
revenues.Meanwhile, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] CEO Michael O'Leary reportedly 
[6]said that the airline will incur a net loss in the band of €200-€300 million ($226-$339 million) for fiscal year 2021 
(ending Mar 31, 2021).Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories1. American Airlines predicts second-
quarter 2020 revenues to tank approximately 90% year over year. Capacity in the period is expected to plummet 
roughly 75% year over year. However, owing to the recent improvement in air-travel demand alongside cost-cutting 
initiatives, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) projects cash-burn rate to fall to nearly $40 million per day in June [7]from 
$100 million in April. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[8]2 Like American Airlines, Delta 
hopes to reduce its average daily cash outflow to zero by 2020-end. Moreover, this Atlanta, GA-based carrier 
envisions the demand-recovery environment to be better on the domestic front than in the international markets. As 
a result, the carrier added 100 domestic flights in June. Moreover, it plans to continue adding flights in the third 
quarter[9].3. Backed by its focus on operating cargo-only flights as passenger revenues decline in the current 
scenario, United Airlines expects cargo revenues to surge more than 30% year over year in the June quarter. 
Additionally, owing to its cost-cutting measures, this Chicago-based carrier expects second-quarter operating 
expenses to decrease 53% year over year. Moreover, second-quarter average daily cash-burn amount is expected 
to be at the lower end of the $40-$45 million guided range. In the third quarter, the same is forecast at almost $30 
million per day. The company is focused on achieving capital expenditure savings of more than $2.5 billion for the 
full year, which will lower its capital budget to below $4.5 billion. Moreover, United Airlines expects to end the third 
quarter of 2020 with total liquidity worth $17 billion.4. Driven by its cost-controlling initiatives, Ryanair reduced its 
average weekly cash-burn rate to around €60 million in May from approximately €200 million in March. Additionally, 
the carrier expects to rebound from a forgettable fiscal 2021 to be profitable in fiscal 2022. However, O'Leary said

that 'Everything will depend on how people will fly between September and March and that there is no second-wave 
outbreak'.5. With the coronavirus pandemic disrupting air-travel demand, LATAM Airlines' LTM[10] May traffic dived 
96.5% on a year-over-year basis. As this Latin American carrier trimmed capacity to cope with the bleak demand 
scenario, consolidated capacity (measured in available seat miles/ASMs) contracted 93.3%. Meanwhile,

NYSE ARCA Airline Index to $59.55. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
declined 45.6%..What's Next in the Airline Space?Investors will keenly wait and watch for further coronavirus-

Jun 16, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Airlines are limiting 
alcohol sales as they begin to welcome back more passengers.The decision is intended to further limit the exposure 
of cabin crew to passengers.Passengers flying on domestic flights will be the most affected with international flights 
largely keeping their alcoholic offerings.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Airports bars are 
about to get more crowded.The world's airlines are adjusting their in-flight offerings as they begin to welcome more 
passengers and for some, begin operations again for the first time in months. Each airline is approaching the task 
differently in an attempt to reduce the exposure of flight crew to passengers but one common approach is limiting 
alcohol sales to passengers, according to CNN[2].The two largest airlines in the US — Delta and American — are 
not offering alcohol to economy passengers on domestic flights, CNN[3] reported. American[4] will serve alcohol on 
request to first-class passengers when flying domestically while Delta[5] will not.As Business Insider found on 
recent domestic flights[6], American is completely restricting its economy in-flight service on domestic flights to "on 
request" and Delta is providing passengers with a sealed plastic bag containing a water bottle, snacks, napkin, and 
single-serving packet of hand sanitizer. 
Both will serve alcoholic beverages in all cabins on long-haul international flights.In the US, it's illegal for 
passengers to consume alcohol not served by flight attendants. The fine for doing so, Business Insider[7] reported, 
can be up to $11,000.In Europe, some of the continent's largest airlines are also scaling back on alcohol, according 
to CNN[8], including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, EasyJet, and Ryanair.British Airways 
will only be suspending alcohol sales in short-haul economy, according to its website[9], while Virgin Atlantic is 
completely suspending alcohol service on its flights, CNN[10] reported. Read the original article on Business

Jun 15, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We recently issued an 
updated report on Union Pacific Corporation UNP[1].Like many other transportation companies, Union Pacific is hit 
by uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic.The coronavirus outbreak caused disruptions in China's supply 
chain starting in mid-February followed by the closure of the U.S. automotive plants in March-end. Both freight 
revenues and volumes declined during the first quarter. The impact is likely to be more negative in the second 
quarter, where volumes are anticipated to plunge approximately 20%. Due to the bleak volume projection, operating 
ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) will not improve in the second quarter on a year-over-year 
basis, despite cost-cutting measures. Also, due to the COVID-related uncertainty, Union Pacific withdrew its 2020 
guidance with respect to operating ratio, headcount, volumes and buybacks.High-debt levels are also worrisome. 
Union Pacific's debt/EBITDA ratio (adjusted) increased to 2.5 at the end of 2019 and 2.7 at the end of first-quarter 
2020. A high debt/EBITDA ratio often indicates that a firm may be unable to service its debt appropriately.However, 
the company's cost cutting strategies are impressive. In first-quarter 2020, the bottom line improved 11.4% on a 
year-over-year basis, primarily due to low costs. Operating expenses contracted 10% to $3,086 million. Additionally, 
operating income in the first quarter increased 9% year over year to $2,143 million.Though the company withdrew 
its guidance for share buybacks, it continues to pay out dividends. This signifies its financial strength. Union pacific 
intends to mainatin its dividend payout ratio between 40% and 45% in the long term. Moreover, its ability to 
generate free cash flow ($688 million in the first quarter, up 25% year over year) is a positive and supports its 
dividend-paying capacity.Union Pacific Corporation Price https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/UNP/price?icid=chart-

Jun 15, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of C.H. Robinson 
Worldwide CHRW[1] have lost 5.6% in the past year against the industry[2]'s 3.8% growth.Let's delve deeper to 
unearth the reasons for such a disappointing price performance.C.H. Robinson is taking a hit from the lackluster 
freight scenario in the United states. The company is seeing softness in truckload volumes due to weak freight 
market conditions. Due to depressing freight conditions, the company's earnings missed estimates in three of the 
last four quarters, surpassing the same on a single occasion. 
The average negative surprise is 13.04%.The already bleak volume scenario due to freight sluggishness is 
aggravated by the coronavirus crisis, which induced supply-chain disruptions. Moreover, amid the economic 
downturn, high capital expenditures may further impede prospects in the near term by limiting bottom-line growth. 
Despite several adversities, the company continues to project capital expenses of $60-$70 million for 
2020.Additionally, the company's total debt to total capital ratio stood at 0.47 at the end of the first quarter of 2020, 
comparing unfavorably with the reading of 0.42 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. The increasing debt-to-
capitalization ratio indicates that the proportion of debt to finance the company's assets is on the rise. Moreover, 
C.H. Robinson exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $295 million, way below the current debt 
figure of $373 million, implying that the company lacks enough cash in hand to meet even its current debt 
obligations.Estimate Revision &#38; Momentum ScoreThe fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 
earnings has been revised 16.9% downward over the past 60 days, is indicative of the pessimism surrounding this 
Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. Moreover, the stock has a Momentum Score[3] of C, highlighting its short-term 
unattractiveness.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation[4] sector are Air Lease 
Corporation AL[5], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] and Teekay Tankers Ltd. TNK[7], all currently carrying a Zacks 
Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[8]Long-term 
earnings (three to five years) growth rate for Air Lease, Ryanair Holdings and Teekay Tankers is estimated at 3.1%, 
20.5% and 3%, respectively.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all

Jun 12, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  British Airways, 
easyJet, and Ryanair have joined forces to take legal action against the UK government over its compulsory 
quarantine for new arrivals.The rule came into force on Monday and requires anyone arriving in the UK by plane to 
spend 14 days in quarantine.The trio told Business Insider they are seeking a judicial review to overturn the 
measure.The "flawed" plan will have "a devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy and destroy 
thousands of jobs," the airlines said.The airlines say they will accept the old rule back, where quarantine was limited 
to passengers arriving from "high risk" countries.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. British 
Airways, easyJet and Ryanair — three of the largest airlines in Europe — are together taking legal action against 
the UK government over its compulsory 14-day quarantine required for all new arrivals.The airlines are grouping 
together to seek a judicial review which would overturn the rule, the trio told Business Insider in a joint statement 
Friday.The airlines said the "government's flawed quarantine" will have "a devastating effect on British tourism and 
the wider economy and destroy thousands of jobs."The legal basis for the complaint is based on the premise that 
the 14-day quarantine is "more stringent than the guidelines applied to people who actually have COVID-19," the 
airlines said."There was no consultation and no scientific evidence provided for such a severe policy," they 
said.They added that they want the government to revert to the policy introduced on March 10, where "quarantine is 
limited to passengers from 'high risk' countries."Last month, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary called[2] the 14-day 
quarantine "idiotic" and said it is "both unimplementable and unmanageable," suggesting masks and temperature 
checks would do.(Temperature checks are ineffective in catching coronavirus cases[3] where patients don't get a 
fever. 
About a quarter of coronavirus patients don't develop fevers.)The UK is one of the worst-hit countries in Europe, 
and some countries have taken steps of their own to minimize the risk of a second wave of infections from 
Britain.On Wednesday, Slovakia excluded Britain from its EU travel corridor[4] over concerns people from the UK 
were most likely to bring the virus.The UK government has scrambled to find ways to keep the travel industry alive, 
including floating the idea of "air bridges" between the UK and select other countries.But easyJet, British Airways, 
and Ryanair said Friday they have "not yet seen any evidence on how and when proposed 'air bridges' between the 
UK and other countries will be implemented."Portugal[5] has expressed willingness to welcome UK tourists this

Jun 12, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per a Reuters report[1], 
European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] is likely to incur a net loss in the band of €200-€300 million 
($226-$339 million) in fiscal year 2021 (ending Mar 31, 2021). According to the report, Ryanair's CEO Michael 
O'Leary provided this bleak forecast in an interview to Spanish newspaper, Expansion.The drab projection is 
primarily prompted by the coronavirus-induced lackluster air-travel demand scenario. In fact, due to the ongoing 
global health peril, majority of Ryanair's fleet remains grounded. Notably, in May, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Irish 
carrier operated only 701 scheduled flights including those for rescue operations, relief and medicine supply on 
behalf of various EU governments. 
Also, with the coronavirus pandemic disrupting air-travel demand, Ryanair reported a 99.5% year-over-year plunge 
in May traffic to merely 0.07 million guests. Due to travel bans and curbs, Ryanair expects its traffic numbers for 
June to be persistently minimal.In a bid to adjust to this extremely low-demand scenario, Ryanair is cutting costs to 
drive its bottom line. The company reduced its average weekly cash burn rate to around €60 million in May from 
approximately €200 million in March.Coming back to O'Leary's comments, he stated on a more positive note that 
the carrier is expected to make profits again starting fiscal 2022. However, throwing in a word of caution he said 
that 'Everything will depend on how people will fly between September and March and that there is no second-wave 
outbreak'.Other Key Picks Investors interested in the broader Zacks Transportation sector may also consider some 
other top-ranked stocks like Air Lease Corporation AL[3],Teekay Tankers Ltd. TNK[4] and GasLog LP GLOG[5], all 
currently carrying the same Zacks Rank as Ryanair. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here.[6]Long-term earnings (three to five years) growth rate for Air Lease and Teekay Tankers 
is estimated at 3.1% and 3%, respectively. Meanwhile, GasLog's earnings outshined the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate in two of the last four quarters (missing the mark in the other two). The average beat is 46.8%.Biggest 
Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could 
impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by 
these new devices. In the process, it's expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.A 
select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains 
similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s. Zacks' just-released special report reveals 8 stocks to watch. The report is

Jun 12, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We recently issued an 
updated report on Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. EXPD[1].Like many other transportation companies, 
Expeditors is hit by uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic.Expeditors' first-quarter 2020 top line was hurt 
due to supply-chain disruptions stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. The extended closure of factories in 
China due to the virus outbreak dented freight volumes in the March quarter. Notably, volumes pertaining to 
airfreight tonnage and ocean container contracted 7% and 10%, respectively, year over year. Apart from factory 
shutdowns, commercial flight cancellations and reduced ocean sailings led to double-digit fall in operating 
income.With the current economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Expeditors' operations are under 
pressure. For instance, North Asia, South Asia and North America registered tonnage declines of 9%, 11% and 4%, 
respectively, in first-quarter 2020. With the health peril showing no signs of subsiding, volumes is likely to be weak 
in the second quarter as well, thereby hurting overall results.Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. Price            
https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/EXPD/price?icid=chart-EXPD-fundamental/price Expeditors International of 
Washington, Inc. 
price[2] | Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. Quote[3]Meanwhile, Expeditors currently has a sound 
balance sheet. We are also encouraged by Expeditors' sound balance sheet. As of Mar 31, 2020, the company had 
no long-term debt (other than lease liabilities), mainly due to its asset-light business model. Moreover, its current 
ratio stood at 2.26 and 2.37 at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 
respectively, comparing favorably with the respective figures for the industry of 1.72 and 1.83. A higher current ratio 
implies that the company is more likely to meet its liabilities which are due over the next 12 months.Zacks Ranks 
&#38; Key PicksExpeditors currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks 
Transportation [4]sector are Air Lease Corporation AL[5], Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[6] and Teekay Tankers Ltd. 
TNK[7]. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here.[8]Long-term earnings (three to five years) growth rate for Air Lease, Ryanair Holdings and

Jun 11, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  LATAM Airlines Group 
S.A. LTM[1] reported bland traffic numbers for May, primarily due to weak air travel demand stemming from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) deteriorated as traffic plunge outweighed 
capacity contraction.Consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) of LATAM Airlines 
tanked 96.5% on a year-over-year basis. As this carrier trimmed capacity to cope with the bleak demand scenario, 
consolidated capacity (measured in available seat miles/ASMs) plunged 93.3%. Meanwhile, consolidated load 
factor dropped 39.8 percentage points to 43.8%. Passenger count too slumped 96.7%.During the first five months 
of 2020, LATAM Airlines generated RPKs of 29,438 million (down 42.8% year over year) and ASMs of 36,913 
million (down 39.8% year over year). Load factor declined 4.2 percentage points year over year to 79.8%. 
Passenger count at LATAM Airlines fell 38.9% in the January-May period.LATAM Airlines Group S.A. Price

Jun 10, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  The aviation and tourism industries 
condemned the United Kingdom's decision to introduce a 14-day quarantine for international travellers. Last month, 
the government announced[1] that, from June 8, all international arrivals, including returning Britons, will have to 
self-isolate and provide details of where they will be staying. Critics, however, say the introduction of the quarantine 
has come too late, and many believe it would be ineffective. Earlier this week, Ryanair's boss Micheal O'Leary said 
the airline will not cancel flights to and from the UK, and accused[2] ministers of making the quarantine plan up as 
they go along.: 'British people are ignoring this quarantine, they know it's rubbish', he said. British Airways, EasyJet 
and Ryanair have jointly written to the government applying for a judicial review, arguing that the quarantine rules 
are disproportionate. IAG has complained that airlines were not consulted about the move. The government has 
been heavily criticised for its slow response to the pandemic. It did not close the borders, screen international 
arrivals or test travelers during the worst of the outbreak, and instead insisted until May that putting restrictions at 
the border would not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus. [ 1]:

Jun 09, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] failed to achieve its targeted traffic of 154 million for fiscal 2020 due to the coronavirus-induced travel-
demand slump. It was close to the target even as late as March. Nevertheless, the airline's fiscal 2020 traffic of 149 
million (up 4% year over year) is encouraging given the low capacity from the grounding of the more fuel-efficient 
B737 MAX jets and the coronavirus outbreak.Ryanair's stringent cost-cutting measures support its growth potential. 
The company reduced its average weekly cash burn rate to around €60 million in May, from approximately €200 
million in March.The carrier's expansion initiatives fortify its global presence. For instance, in 2019, the airline 
acquired Malta Air — a start-up carrier. Malta Air's fleet consists of around 120 aircraft. Since becoming part of 
Ryanair, the airline has been able to establish a strong presence in France, Germany, Italy and Malta. In 2018, 
Ryanair purchased the Austrian airline Laudamotion. Once the virus concerns stabilize, we expect the carrier to 
resume its expansion efforts.With a sound financial position, Ryanair should be able to come off the crisis strong 
enough. Notably, the carrier's cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal 2020 was €2.57 billion, way above the 
short-term debt figure of €382.3 million, implying that the company has enough cash to meet its short-term debt 
burden.With easing coronavirus-led travel restrictions, shares of Ryanair have surged more than 48% in a month's 
time. The carrier has been seeing a rise in flight bookings lately. Last month, the airline's CEO Michael O'Leary 
stated that there is a 'big surge in bookings[2]' on its flights out of Ireland and the UK to Spain, Portugal and Italy. 
Given these positives, we believe the time is ripe for investors to add the Ryanair stock to their portfolio, as is 
suggested by its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks

Jun 09, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per a Reuters report[1], 
a wage agreement has finally been reached at Ryanair's RYAAY[2] Austrian unit, Laudamotion. This collective 
wage deal that came through at the last minute is of paramount importance as it saves more than 300 employees' 
jobs at its base in Vienna.Notably, last month, Lauda announced that it was closing down its Vienna hub following 
its failure to arrive at a pay-related pact. Even management at the parent company Ryanair had confirmed that it will 
shut down the Vienna center of its loss-making unit lest the LaudaMotion employees do not accept the salary 
cuts.The wage deal between Vida, a trade union representing workers in the transport and service industries in 
Austria, and the Austrian Chamber of Commerce was finally inked last week, which put an end to the long-standing 
negotiations between the concerned parties.Even though the deal was successful, management at Laudamotion 
stated that some jobs will be lost and the fleet of Lauda's Airbus planes at the Vienna base will be reduced to 10 
from 16[3] as the unit aims to cut costs. 
Per management, these cost synergies will enable Laudamotion to compete with the state-subsidized unit of 
German carrier Deutsche Lufthansa DLAKY[4]. Notably, Laudamotion's entire fleet, currently grounded due to the 
coronavirus pandemic, will take to the skies starting Jul 1.Zacks Rank &#38; Other Key PicksRyanair currently 
carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Investors interested in the broader Zacks Transportation [5]sector may also 
consider some other top-ranked stocks like Air Lease Corporation AL[6] and Teekay Tankers Ltd. TNK[7], both 
presently carrying the same Zacks Rank as Ryanair. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank

Jun 09, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Union Pacific 
Corporation UNP[1] issued a downbeat forecast for overall volumes at the Deutsche Bank Annual Global Industrials 
and Materials Summit, mainly due to coronavirus-related issues. Additionally, the company's chief financial officer 
Jennifer Hamann stated that overall volumes for the second quarter of 2020 decreased 22% on a year-over-year 
basis (through Jun 2, 2020).This unfavorable reading can be primarily attributed to double-digit declines in volumes 
at the Bulk (Grain &#38; grain products, Fertilizer, Food &#38; refrigerated, Coal &#38; renewables: down 16%), 
Premium (down 29%) and Industrial divisions (down 17%).Due to the coronavirus-induced supply-chain disruptions 
and closure of the U.S. automotive plants, Hamann stated that the overall volume decline at Union Pacific is 
estimates to be close to 20% in the June quarter. Notably, in April, management at Union Pacific had expected 
second-quarter carload volumes to plunge approximately 25% year over year due to freight softness as a result of 
the coronavirus crisis.At the above-mentioned conference, Hamann further confirmed that despite the cost-cutting 
measures undertaken by Union Pacific, operating ratio (operating expenses as a % of revenues) — a key measure 
of profitability for stocks in the railroad industry — will not improve in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. 
Notably, the metric in second-quarter 2019 was 59.6%. Per the company's latest outlook, this key measure will 
remain dull due to dismal volume projection. Notably, lower the value of the operating ratio the better.Naturally, the 
grim guidance for second-quarter overall volumes and the operating ratio disappointed investors. Consequently, the 
stock lost value in early trading.Zacks Rank &#38; Key PicksUnion Pacific currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Jun 08, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair[1]'s boss Micheal O'Leary 
said the airline will not cancel flights to and from the United Kingdom despite the government introducing a 14 day 
quarantine for international travellers. Earlier, the government said that, from June 8, all international arrivals, 
including returning Britons, will have to self-isolate and provide details[2] of where they will be staying. Asked 
whether Ryanair would cancel July and August flights if the quarantine remained in place during those months, 
O'Leary said: 'No, because the flights are full outbound of the UK. British people are ignoring this quarantine, they 
know it's rubbish'. The rules do not apply to Ireland, which has a free-movement agreement with the UK. Freight 
drivers, medical professionals and seasonal agricultural workers are also excluded. Those breaking the rules would 
face a $1,220 fine or prosecution, the government warned. Ryanair, EasyJet and IAG have launched a legal protest 
against the quarantine. [ 1]:

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ba-joins-ryanair-and-easyjet-launch-legal-action-against-uk-governments-
quarantine-rules/Britain's three biggest airlines have started legal proceedings against the government in a bid to 
overturn quarantine rules due to take effect in the UK from Monday.BA's owner, IAG, along with Ryanair and 
EasyJet, have sent a pre-action protocol letter setting out why they believes the moves, which will force air 
passengers arriving from abroad to self-isolate for 14 days, are illogical and unfair. Airlines and travel firms have 
protested in vain against the new Home Office-led regulations, which they have said come months late to stop the 
transmission of coronavirus and will kill off any nascent recovery in their industries. 
The airlines' letter argues that the quarantine measures are more severe than those applied where the risks are 
greater, and impose greater restrictions on arrivals than on people infected with Covid-19. The airlines also object 
that enforcement of the regulations as published appears to apply only to England, and people arriving in Scotland, 
Wales or Northern Ireland would not face the same penalties. The devolved administrations have yet to set out how 
they will police the rules. The letter, the first step in an application for judicial review, was sent on Friday. A Ryanair 
spokesperson, commenting on behalf of the three airlines, said: 'These measures are disproportionate and unfair 
on British citizens as well as international visitors arriving in the UK. We urge the government to remove this 
ineffective visitor quarantine which will have a devastating effect on UK's tourism industry and will destroy even 
more thousands of jobs in this unprecedented crisis.' The government has argued that the quarantine rules are 
science-based and would help limit the risk of a second wave as restrictions on movement are eased. The home 
secretary, Priti Patel, said: 'We all want to return to normal as quickly as possible. But this cannot be at the expense 
of lives. The science is clear that if we limit the risk of new cases being brought in from abroad, we can help stop a 
devastating second wave. 'That is why the measures coming into force today are necessary. They will help control 
the virus, protect the NHS and save lives.' Posters spelling out the new requirements for travellers will be displayed 
at all UK ports and airports. Airlines will be expected to notify passengers of the rules, but not to enforce them. The 
director general of Border Force, Paul Lincoln, said officials were 'prepared and ready for the new measures which 
are being enacted at the UK border today'. The quarantine row comes amid further uproar over BA's plans to sack 
about 12,000 staff and lower the terms and conditions of remaining employees. The pilots union Balpa told 
members on Saturday the airline had increased the number of pilot redundancies it was seeking by another 125 to 
BA joins Ryanair and EasyJet launch legal action against UK government's quarantine rules
almost 1,300, more than a quarter of the workforce. It warned that BA had said it would 'force changes by 
terminating the employment of all pilots and offering individuals new contracts with associated new terms and 
conditions' if they could not find agreement. The airline appears to have made concessions on a possible voluntary 
redundancy scheme, which it initially ruled out, saying it would pay only the statutory minimum to longserving staff. 
BA may also start furloughing senior pilots from the grounded A380 and 747 fleets, who had agreed to effectively 
halve their pay by taking unpaid leave at the start of the crisis to allow for a possible quick return to flying. The flag 
carrier's actions have been condemned by ministers and unions. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, 
which represents cabin crew, said: 'BA and its owners IAG can afford to see out this crisis without such drastic cuts. 
This is a company with a lot of cash, strong assets and sustainable debt. The company controls some of the most 
profitable routes in the world and is backed by the Qatar royal family,' a 25% shareholder in IAG. He pointed out 
that IAG was about to spend almost €1bn (870m) on acquiring Air Europa, adding: 'Workers in Britain are being 
sacrificed for the benefit of shareholders.' Read more: BA joins Ryanair and EasyJet launch legal action against UK

Jun 08, 2020( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  LONDON - Britain began 
imposing a 14-day quarantine Monday on travelers coming into the country   a sweeping measure meant to halt the 
further spread of COVID-19 that has been roundly criticized by the tourism industry. All passengers   bar a handful 
of exceptions like truckers or medical workers   will be asked to fill in a form detailing exactly where they will self-
isolate for two weeks and give a phone number so authorities can check up on them. 
The requirement applies regardless if they are citizens or not. In England, new arrivals should stay indoors and rely 
on others to get their food. They can only leave for specific reasons like needing urgent medical care or medicine. 
Those who fail to comply with the quarantine rules could be fined. "There are quite a lot of unknowns about the 
situation," Crime, Policing and Justice Minister Kit Malthouse told the BBC. "But for the moment, having a clear set 
of rules around international travel is critical.' The quarantine was imposed after a heated debate on whether it 
would help British efforts to tamp down the U.K. outbreak or simply stamp out any hopes that the British tourism 
industry will recover following the country's coronavirus lockdown. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary says the 
quarantine will cause "untold devastation' for the country's tourism industry, not just on the airlines. "The thousands 
of hotels, the thousands of visitor attractions, restaurants in the next couple of months - July and August are the two 
key months for British tourism," he said. "We're facing thousands of jobs losses because of a stupid, ineffective 
quarantine.' Authorities had no immediate answers as to why the 14-day quarantine wasn't put in place on March 
23, when Britain began its lockdown, or why an exception was made for attending the funeral of a close family 
relative when funerals are known to be virus-spreading events. Britain did not close its borders during the worst of 
the outbreak. Britain has the second-most most recorded coronavirus deaths in the world   40,625   after the United 
States. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government has been roundly criticized for its slow response 
to fighting the outbreak. Many in his government, including Johnson himself, came down with coronavirus. British 
Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair have written to the British government applying for a judicial review, arguing that the 
quarantine rules are disproportionate. Willie Walsh, the boss of IAG   the group that owns British Airways   has said 
that airlines had not been consulted about the move.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/airlines-seek-quarantine-injunction-as-holiday-bookings-soar/The number of 
Britons booking holidays abroad has doubled in a week amid claims that the 'irrational' quarantine on arrivals in the 
UK could be quashed by the courts.Ryanair, Europe's busiest airline, said today that it had seen a 100 per cent 
increase in the number of people purchasing flights in July and August in the expectation that holidays abroad will 
be given the green light. Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair group chief executive, said the quarantine policy was 'worse 
than useless' and there was a widespread belief that it would not last until the end of the month. International 
Airlines Group (IAG), British Airways' parent company, is planning to file papers with the High Court today 
requesting an urgent hearing to apply for an injunction against the policy. 
The legal challenge is being backed by Ryanair and Easyjet. The comments were made as the first travellers 
arrived in the UK this morning under the quarantine restrictions. As part of the policy, all travellers are required to fill 
in a 'public health passenger locator' form on arrival by air, ferry or through the Channel Tunnel rail link. Arrivals, 
including Britons returning from overseas, are required to provide an address where they will self-isolate for two 
weeks, although they can travel to the property by public transport and embark on food shopping trips. Failure to 
provide an address could result in a 100 fine while those who flout isolation rules can receive a 1,000 penalty. 
There are 42 exempted groups, including hauliers and agricultural workers. About 40 flights landed at Heathrow this 
morning from destinations including the US, Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, Doha, Bahrain, Ethiopia and across 
Europe. However, the chaotic introduction of the measures was criticised today. Lucy Moreton, a professional 
officer at the Immigration Services Union, told the BBC that technical papers explaining what to check for only 
arrived on Friday and were still not available to many border staff. She insisted there was no system for checking 
addresses and that only clear rule-breakers would be picked up. A leaked memo to Border Force officials said that 
only 'manifestly false' information such as an arrival putting down their name as 'Mickey Mouse' or their address as 
'Buckingham Palace' would result in checks. Transport and travel companies are calling for the blanket quarantine 
to be scrapped in favour of more targeted measures, including health checks at airports. They also want 
quarantine-free 'air bridges' to be created between the UK and low-risk countries. The Sun reported today that 
Foreign Office advice against all but essential international travel is expected to be scrapped within days. It would 
provide a further sign that the UK is preparing to allow people to take holidays abroad this summer. Speaking today, 
Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to consider testing people on arrival in the UK rather than imposing the 
Airlines seek quarantine injunction as holiday bookings soar
blanket measures. The Labour leader criticised the policy as an example of the government's 'inconsistency and 
slowness' in responding to the pandemic and questioned why it was necessary at this point. 'Weeks ago other 
countries put quarantine in and we didn't,' Sir Keir told LBC radio. 'Now, as everybody's lifting it, we're putting it in.' 
He added: 'We would like to see a situation where the test was returned within 24 hours. You might have to hold 
people at the airport until that test result was in.' IAG, Easyjet and Ryanair wrote over the weekend to Sir Jonathan 
Jones, the government's most senior legal official, in the first stage of its legal action. They want the measures to be 
suspended pending a review. They are also preparing to lodge papers with the High Court seeking an urgent 
hearing for an injunction. That could take place later this week. Speaking to The Times, Mr O'Leary said that the 
airlines wanted an injunction on the grounds that the policy is 'irrational'. 'It isn't a quarantine,' he said. 'Filling in a 
piece of paper before you are allowed loose on the London Underground or into Sainsbury's and Tesco or onto 
your local beach is not a quarantine. Even the Home Office today confirm that it is unpoliceable and it is 
unimplementable. It is worse than useless. 'We think that the courts will overturn this on the grounds of irrationality 
alone. You haven't got a quarantine and the impression given is deterring thousands of people from coming to the 
UK from countries with lower R-rates than the UK and that will cost thousands of jobs. We think there is a 
reasonable prospect of getting an injunction against it.' Ryanair, which operates from 27 UK airports, is planning to 
introduce 1,000 flights a day across Europe from the start of July. Mr O'Leary said the airline had seen a big 
increase in bookings among UK families seeking to travel to the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. 'Most of the 
traffic will be outbound,' he said. 'Our bookings doubled this weekend compared with the previous weekend, mainly 
with UK families booking holidays to go to the Canaries, the Algarve, the Balearics, Malaga and Italy. 'Most people 
in the UK know that the quarantine is completely bonkers and useless . . . Most are gambling, in my view correctly, 
that the quarantine has so little credibility that it will be removed before the end of June anyway.' Travellers arriving 
at Heathrow this morning described fines for breaking new quarantine rules as 'crazy' and 'terrifying'. However, 
many passengers appeared unfazed as they ambled through arrivals at Terminal 2. Apart from the many 
facemasks being worn, it appeared to be business as usual. Some people were lying on top of their bags while 
others huddled near plug sockets as they waited for families to touch down. All who had just landed have been 
instructed to complete forms detailing where they will isolate for the next 14 days and contact information. Some 
were shocked to learn they faced fines of up to 3,200 for providing the wrong information and 1,000 for failing to self 
isolate. The sudden airport policy shift has prompted passengers to abandon plans to travel to their homes on 
public transport and instead pay for Uber taxis to London. One American passenger flying in to Terminal 2 with his 
girlfriend said: 'I didn't know it was 1,000. I will still comply but 1,000 is crazy. 'I did the form online but my phone 
died, it was a bit of a drama sorting out the phone chargers. But I got it done and the system was pretty easy. 'I 
didn't lie [on the form] but the 3,000 fine is terrifying. I hope they're not actually fining people these insane amounts. 
'I was aware that the police might actually visit your house, knock on the door. It seemed outlandish but we were 
ready for that possibility. 'But overall I think it's good that the UK government has put measures in place to better 
control the virus.' Read more: Airlines seek quarantine injunction as holiday bookings soar[1] [ 1]:

Jun 08, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per Reuters[1], United 
Airlines Holdings UAL[2] is closing three out of its four international bases for flight attendants in the face of low 
demand.The Chicago, IL-based airline, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is shutting down bases at Frankfurt, 
Hong Kong and Tokyo with effect from Oct 1, while maintaining operations at its London base, per its head of in-
flight services John Slater.The closures will impact around 840 flight attendants, who would need to be transferred 
to the airline's U.S. bases for the October flying schedule, but that would depend on their eligibility to work 
there.United Airlines Holdings Inc Price            https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/UAL/price?icid=chart-UAL-
fundamental/price United Airlines Holdings Inc price[3] | United Airlines Holdings Inc Quote[4] Coronavirus concerns 
have ravaged the air travel industry with demand stooping to an unprecedented low level, especially on the 
international front amid government travel restrictions. Evidently, United Airlines' June capacity is expected to be 
down approximately 90% year over year.Anticipating a slow recovery process as coronavirus concerns continue, 
airlines are taking measures to reduce the size of their overall operations. 
To this end, United Airlines had earlier revealed plans to cut 13 officer jobs[5] as part of its cost-cutting measures. 
Prior to that, American Airlines Group AAL[6], carrying a Zacks Rank #3, had announced plans to cut jobs in the 
management and support staff team by 30%.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation[7]

Jun 08, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We recently issued an 
updated report on Trinity Industries, Inc. TRN[1]. Like many other transportation companies, Trinity is hit by 
uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic.Trinity's bottom line declined year over year mainly due to 
disappointing performance of the Rail Products Group. Segmental revenues and operating profit declined, thanks to 
low railcar deliveries and reduced operational efficiency.Trinity Industries, Inc. Price            
https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/TRN/price?icid=chart-TRN-fundamental/price Trinity Industries, Inc. 
price[2] | Trinity Industries, Inc. Quote[3]While first-quarter results weren't affected much, Trinity expects the 
coronavirus pandemic to affect its near-term performance. Weak shipping volumes in Trinity's highway products 
operations might hurt results. To combat the crisis, the company has cut back on non-essential expenses. It 
expects costs to reduce by $25-$30 million in 2020 on the back of these endeavors. Lower investments might 
hamper its growth prospects.Moreover, since E. Jean Savage took over as the company's president and CEO, 
replacing the company's long-serving CEO Timothy R. Wallace, it is feared that investors' confidence in the stock 
may take a hit.Meanwhile, Trinity's top-line performance in first-quarter 2020 is impressive owing to higher railcar 
volumes. Also, at the end of the first quarter, Trinity did not have any short-term debt, while its cash and cash 
equivalents stood at $213 million at the end of the same period.Zacks Ranks &#38; Key PicksTrinity currently 
carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation [4]sector 
are Air Lease Corporation AL[5], Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[6] and Teekay Tankers Ltd. TNK[7]. All the stocks 
carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks 
here.[8]Long-term earnings (three to five years) growth rate for Air Lease, Ryanair Holdings and Teekay Tankers is 
estimated at 3.05%, 20.49% and 3%, respectively.5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand-picked by a Zacks expert 
as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2020. Each comes from a different sector and has unique

Jun 08, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of GATX 
Corporation GATX[1] have lost 16.1% in the past six months compared with the industry[2]'s 10.9% decline.Let's 
delve deeper to unearth the reasons for the disappointing price performance.GATX is taking a hit from the weak 
performance of the Rail International unit, which is a significant contributor to its top line. Evidently, segmental 
revenues decreased 6.1% in the March quarter due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.Moreover, softness 
in the North American railcar leasing market is worrisome. The railcar leasing space, after having improved in 2018, 
started decelerating again in 2019. The presence of railcar oversupply does not bode well. 
With the ongoing coronavirus-induced downturn, average lease rate on lease renewals is expected to be low in 
2020. This, in turn, is likely to weigh on the Rail North America segment's profitability.Although the impact of the 
coronavirus was limited in the March quarter, a prolonged slowdown in the economy is expected to leave a 
substantial impact on the company's operations and in turn, on its subsequent quarterly results. Notably, GATX 
suspended its previously-announced 2020 guidance due to uncertainties related to the COVID-19 
pandemic.Estimate Revisions &#38; VGM ScoreThe fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 earnings has 
been revised downward to the tune of 28.7% over the past 60 days, is indicative of the negativity surrounding this 
Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock. Moreover, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score[3] of C. Notably, V stands for 
Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. Key PicksInvestors interested in in the broader Zacks Transportation 
[4]sector may consider some better-ranked stocks like Air Lease Corporation AL[5], Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[6] 
and Teekay Tankers Ltd. TNK[7], each currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[8]Long-term earnings (three to five years) growth rate for Air 
Lease, Ryanair Holdings and Teekay Tankers is estimated at 3.1%, 20.5% and 3%, respectively.5 Stocks Set to 
DoubleEach was hand-picked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2020. Each 
comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth.Most of the 
stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground 
floor.Today,

Jun 08, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With the COVID-19 
outbreak affecting air-travel demand severely, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes' GOL[1] did not operate its 
international flights during May. Its total monthly traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), tanked 
93.7% on a year-over-year basis.With Gol Linhas lowering capacity in response to dwindling demand, total monthly 
capacity (measured in available seat miles) contracted 93.1% Moreover, consolidated load factor (% of seats filled 
by passengers) fell to 74.8% from 82.1% a year ago. Load factor declined as the fall in traffic was more than 
capacity contraction.Gol Linhas' total monthly departures plunged 93% and seats declined 93.6%.However, with 
air-travel demand improving on the domestic front (domestic demand rose 5% in May compared with April), the 
company boosted its network to operate 70 flights per day for May, primarily to cope with the increased flight 
frequencies at the Braslia and Rio de Janeiro airports. Moreover, Gol reinitiated flights for So Paulo, Santa Catarina 
and Paran airports.Additionally, supply in May increased 12.1% on a month-on-month basis.Gol Linhas Aereas

Jun 08, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With air-travel demand 
remaining low, Delta Air Lines DAL[1] has suspended flights to 11 U.S. destinations. The decision, effective today, 
is also aimed at managing costs as the carrier tries to combat the crisis posed by the coronavirus pandemic.The 
move is in accordance with the directive of the U.S. Department of Transportation, which allowed airlines to adjust 
their operations and reschedule flights wherever 'reasonable and practicable'. With demand being persistently tepid 
at the following destinations, namely Aspen, CO, Bangor, ME, Erie, PA, Flint, MI, Fort Smith, AR, Lincoln, NE, New 
Bern/Morehead/Beaufort, NC, Peoria, IL, Santa Barbara, CA, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, PA and Williston, ND, Delta 
suspended operations to these destinations, which make up approximately 5% of its domestic services. Despite 
Delta suspending operations at these airports, they will continue to be served by at least one other 
carrier.Moreover, management decided to re-accommodate the concerned passengers on account of its above 
made decision. 
Further, this Atlanta, GA-based carrier decided to indefinitely suspend flights to Ottawa from Jun 21 onward due to 
lackluster demand.With Delta like other airlines trimming capacity to compensate for this extremely bleak scenario, 
Delta announced an 85% reduction in its schedule for the June quarter. Of the total, 80% cut will be on the 
domestic front and 90% internationally.Zacks Ranks &#38; Key PicksDelta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Transportation [2]sector are Air Lease Corporation AL[3], 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] and Teekay Tankers Ltd. TNK[5], each currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You 
can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[6]Long-term earnings (three to five 
years) growth rate for Air Lease, Ryanair Holdings and Teekay Tankers is estimated at 3.1%, 20.5% and 3%, 
respectively.5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand-picked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain 
+100% or more in 2020. Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel 
exceptional growth.Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/british-airways-shuns-priti-patel-meeting-over-quarantine-plans/A 
row 
has 
broken out between Priti Patel and British Airways over the plans to quarantine travellers for 14 days as the airline 
refused to meet her, and a government source branded the company 'not serious about getting Britain working 
again'.Tensions between the government and the airline escalated on Thursday, as Alex Cruz, the chief executive 
of BA, declined to join an industry call with Patel, the home secretary, and Kelly Tolhurst, the aviation minister. 
Conservative MPs are up in arms about the quarantine proposals, arguing they will harm airlines and dash people's 
hopes of summer holidays, but Boris Johnson insisted this week that the policy will go ahead from Monday as an 
essential way of stopping new outbreaks of coronavirus. 
Earlier on Thursday, Cruz had warned employees that BA's parent company was haemorrhaging cash and accused 
the government of dealing 'another blow' by pressing ahead with the plan to quarantine inbound travellers for 14 
days at a time when many other countries are lifting such measures. Airports, aviation bodies and almost every 
other major airline apart from Ryanair were on the call with Patel. A source said the industry made the case for the 
quarantine rules to be in place for three weeks only until the first review date on 29 June. A source close to the talks 
said that BA's team had advised Cruz that it 'wasn't worth his time engaging'. The approach appears to have gone 
down badly with the government, with a Whitehall source saying: 'It's a shame that British Airways don't want to 
directly make their case to the home secretary and the aviation minister. Clearly they aren't serious about working 
with the government to get Britain moving again.' It comes the day after Tolhurst had already criticised BA for its 
move to cut thousands of jobs and change terms and conditions while workers are on the government-funded 
furlough scheme. One person with knowledge of the call said the home secretary made no promises but had been 
in 'listening mode'. She told the airlines that she understood the urgency and would work together with other 
government departments, having already told Tory rebels against the plan that it was a 'temporary, time-limited 
policy' to help reduce the spread of transmission. The source said: 'It was the meeting she should have had months 
ago.' During the meeting, Patel told the airlines: 'Protecting lives will always be our top priority, but I am alive to the 
impact on your sector and I'm asking you to work with us on this I know you share my commitment to protecting 
passengers and the whole of our country from a second wave of coronavirus We're listening and we want to find 
solutions together, that's why we're here today.' Many Tory MPs opposed to the plans and the airlines believe the 
quarantine measures will be shortlived - possibly three or six weeks - before being replaced by so-called air bridges 
British Airways shuns Priti Patel meeting over quarantine plans
involving reciprocal arrangements with other countries that have similar infection rates. No 10 is cautious about 
promising air bridges just yet as some countries are not keen to allow in British travellers without quarantine when 
the UK's transmission rate is still high. However, some cabinet ministers and dozens of Conservative MPs are 
pushing for the quarantine to be as short as possible because of the economic impact of the policy on the aviation 
industry and worries about job losses. Treasury sources said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, believes a time-limited 
quarantine period for travellers will have a 'negligible' economic impact but if the policy were to continue for a longer 
period of many months, then 'that would be another matter'. Scientists have already criticised the quarantine 
arrangements for not having enough of an impact. Unions also have deep concerns about the consequences of the 
plan. Lucy Moreton, from the Immigration Services Union (ISU), which represents around 4,000 Border Force 
members, branded the system 'farcical' and said passengers could fill 'complete rubbish' into the address form and 
there is no way for Border Force officers to verify whether it is correct. She said: 'That data is passed on to PHE 
who then determine how many will be contacted by phone. It's widely believed to be about 10% will be telephoned. 
'But they will be phoned on the number they provide Police forces have been clear they don't have resources to be 
chasing around after this. The chances of them visiting, unless there's another criminal contact, is zero to nil.' Read

Jun 05, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We recently issued an 
updated report on Golar LNG Limited GLNG[1].In May, Golar LNG delivered an increase in first-quarter 2020 
revenues. The upside can be partly attributed to an impressive performance at FLNG and strong seasonal results in 
shipping. Notably, FLNG Hilli Episeyo maintained its 100% commercial uptime in the March quarter. 
In the event of FLNG's strong performance continuing in the upcoming quarters, results will be aided significantly. 
Successful operation of the FLNG Hilli Episeyo is another upside and will likely continue boosting 
results.Additionally, the partnership with BR Distribuidora and utilization of spare capacity on FSRU Golar Nanook, 
in response to low LNG prices is expected to help the company generate substantial earnings in the short-to-
medium term.Besides, commencement of operations from the FLNG Unit, Gimi (production commencing from 
fourth-quarter 2022) is expected to generate annual EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortization) of around $215 million or more.Like many other transportation companies, Golar LNG is hit by 
uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak has significantly hampered prospects by disrupting 
supply chain.Also, Golar LNG has a debt-laden balance sheet. The company exited the first quarter with cash and 
cash equivalents of $227 million, far below the short-term debt of $1233 million. This indicates that the company 
doesn't have enough cash to meet its short-term debt burden.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderGolar LNG 
currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors can also consider some other top-ranked stocks from the broader 
Zacks Transportation [2]sector like Air Lease Corporation AL[3], Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[4] and Teekay

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/british-airways-threatens-legal-action-over-irrational-quarantine-
measures/The government is facing legal action over its decision to quarantine all arrivals into the UK amid 
warnings that the 'irrational' policy will be catastrophic for airlines.British Airways' parent company today confirmed 
that it was consulting lawyers in an attempt to block the policy, which is due to be introduced from Monday. Willie 
Walsh, the chief executive of International Airlines Group (IAG), said that it was likely that other airlines would also 
bring legal challenges against the measures. 
He insisted that the quarantine, which is applied to foreign arrivals and Britons returning from overseas, was an 
'irrational piece of legislation' and had 'torpedoed' BA's attempts to resume flight operations in July. It had hoped to 
operate 40 per cent of flights next month. The comments have been made only three days before the policy is due 
to be introduced for people arriving in the UK by air, ferry and through the Channel tunnel rail link. Under the 
reforms, all arrivals will be forced to self-isolate for two weeks, with the possibility of 1,000 fines for those who flout 
the rules. About 40 groups will be exempt, including hauliers and airline crew. However, the measures have been 
condemned by backbench MPs, airlines and holiday companies, while scientists have queried their effectiveness. 
The UK is believed to be the only big country to impose a new quarantine so late in the pandemic and experts have 
asked whether it will be helpful in controlling a second outbreak of the infection in the UK. More than 300 travel and 
hospitality businesses have signed a letter to Priti Patel, the home secretary, opposing the plan, with some warning 
that they will go bust or be forced to lay off 60 per cent of staff because of the loss of income. The policy will be 
reviewed every three weeks and the government has indicated that it will eventually be replaced with more focused 
'air bridges' that allow quarantine-free travel from low-risk countries. Countries such as Greece, Portugal, Spain and 
Turkey are already believed to be in talks with the UK government over the move. However, Mr Walsh said that 
airlines were hoping to get the policy quashed — possibly before it is introduced — because of concerns over the 
way it has been implemented. He said that airlines were not consulted in advance and it would have no bearing on 
the control of the virus. Large numbers of airlines, including Ryanair, Easyjet, Jet2, Virgin Atlantic and TUI, are 
planning to resurrect flight operations from late June and into July. However, it is feared that the quarantine will 
prevent most people booking to fly in and out of the UK. One study this week suggested that only a fifth of people 
would risk flying while the measures remain in place. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Walsh said: 'This initiative has in 
effect torpedoed our opportunity to get flying in July. We think it is irrational, we think it is disproportionate and we 
British Airways threatens legal action over 'irrational' quarantine measures
are giving consideration to a legal challenge to this legislation. So we are reviewing that with the lawyers later on 
today. 'I suspect that there are other airlines that are doing so because it is important to point out that there was no 
consultation with the industry prior to enacting this legislation and we do believe it is an irrational piece of 
legislation.' IAG wrote to MPs on Thursday outlining the challenges the company faces and defending its decision 
to make 12,000 BA staff redundant. The company has faced criticism over the move, which is still subject to 
consultation, after it accepted tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money through the government's job retention 
scheme. In his letter Mr Walsh said: 'There are some who believe the company is exaggerating the scale of the 
challenge. Nothing could be further from the truth. The situation is unprecedented. Nobody is flying. 'British Airways 
had hoped to operate about 40 per cent of our scheduled flights in July but this has been torpedoed by the 
introduction of the 14-day quarantine period for people arriving into the UK. British Airways is not generating any 
revenues and continues to burn through approximately 20 million of cash a day. The current situation is not 
sustainable. 'The company has already taken on an additional 800 million of short-term debt to supplement its cash 
position. That debt must be repaid.' On Thursday afternoon Ms Patel had an online meeting with airlines to discuss 
the policy. BA boycotted the meeting amid opposition to the measures. The home secretary told aviation bosses: 
'To stop this disease in its tracks we've had to make some tough choices, huge sacrifices have already been made, 
and I know how hard the new measures will be for you all. 'But we're here because we all share one aim: to keep 
people safe and get Britain moving again.' She added: 'We have all made sacrifices in recent weeks as part of an 
extraordinary national effort to beat coronavirus, and while the safety of our people is at risk this must continue. 
'The new public health measures at the border are essential to protect the hard-won progress we have made and 
help prevent a second wave.' Read more: British Airways threatens legal action over 'irrational' quarantine

Jun 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With the coronavirus 
pandemic disrupting air-travel demand, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported a 99.5% 
year-over-year plunge in May traffic to merely 0.07 million guests. As wide-spread travel restrictions are still in 
place, the carrier's LaudaMotion unit in Austria did not carry any passenger during the month.This Zacks Rank #2 
(Buy) Irish carrier operated 701 scheduled flights in May including those for rescue operations, relief and medicine 
supply on behalf of various EU governments. Moreover, 99% of those flights arrived on time. 
On a rolling annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion unit) decreased 17% to 121 million. 
Load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) was 95% on a rolling annual basis. Due to travel bans and curbs, 
Ryanair expects its traffic numbers for June to be minimal too.To match this extremely low demand scenario, 
Ryanair trimmed its flight capacity significantly. Notably, it is not the only carrier to have slashed capacity due to the 
pandemic-borne crisis. U.S.-based carriers including American Airlines AAL[2] and United Airlines UAL[3], both 
currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), also suspended various flights in the wake of the coronavirus 
onslaught.The traffic report apart, Ryanair recently grabbed headlines for challengingthe government rescue 
package for the Zacks #3 Ranked German carrier Deutsche Lufthansa DLAKY[4]. This European low-cost airline 
fears that the huge state aid, which will be effective following the European Commission's approval, will tamper a 
healthy competition and deny a fair play to low-cost carriers like Ryanair.You can see the complete list of today's

Jun 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate 
ReleaseChicago, IL - June 3, 2020 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day 
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. 
Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Wingstop Inc. WING[1], Papa John's International, Inc. 
PZZA[2], Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[3], Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI[4] and Civeo Corporation CVEO[5].Here 
are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog: 5 Stocks with Decent Growth Potential to Watch AheadU.S. markets 
have gathered steam over the past couple of weeks, thanks to the country's economy which is slowly coming back 
on track. As lockdown measures are being lifted across the country and people are venturing out to their favorite 
stores and restaurants or making travel plans, various parts of the economy are witnessing more activity.This is why 
now could be the ideal time to add stocks with good growth potential to one's watch list.Markets Significantly Up 
Since March LowsU.S. stocks have come a long way from their lowest points on Mar 23. The three major indexes, 
the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&#38;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have gained more than 30% since 
then. Specifically, the Dow Jones, the S&#38;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have added 32.9%, 32.6% and 
37.9%, respectively, since Mar 23.Of course, several factors have aided this impressive growth in a little more than 
two months. Two rate cuts by the central bank in March (once by 0.50% and the second time by 1%) undoubtedly 
helped industries (current rates are between 0% and 0.25%) along with about $2.3 trillion in several measures that 
comprise loans to help small- and medium-sized businesses. The government's $3 trillion in coronavirus relief 
packages to aid states, local governments and American taxpayers assisted the markets as well.In fact, last week, 
the Dow Jones crossed 25,000 points for the first time since March, boosted by optimism over a reviving economy 
as all 50 states are reopening centers of business. As of Jun 1, the index remains well above 25,000 points, having 
closed at 25,475.02 at the end of Monday's trading session. In addition, the S&#38;P 500 crossed the 3,000 mark 
for the first time since Mar 5 on May 26.Which Industries Could Gain Ahead and Why?Keeping in mind the 
substantial gains the three indexes have raked in since March, one could take a look at the factors that have 
propelled equities so far and may continue to do so ahead. In addition, delving deeper into the industries that are 
now well positioned for encouraging movement ahead is prudent.First, as business hubs, offices, restaurants, 
hotels and other public places reopen around the country, consumer activity is gathering steam again. This is why 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Wingstop , Papa John's International, Ryanair , Darden Restaurants and 
Civeo
businesses such as airlines, hotels, restaurants, retailers of apparel, shoes and other discretionary items that were 
hit hard during the pandemic are expected to gain momentum.Although many restrictions remain in place, 
consumers are getting back to their routines pre lockdown and are visiting restaurants, and making plans to travel 
and buy new property.Per a CNBC report, data from online reservation platform Open Table revealed that 
restaurant bookings declined as much as 100% in the last weeks of March and most of April as compared to 2019. 
However, as states allowed restaurants to reopen dining instead of just rely on takeout, delivery and curbside 
pickup, bookings in restaurants started picking up toward May-end again, indicating a revival of the food service 
industry.Second, the hotel and travel industries are regaining their lost glory too, as the occupancy rate for U.S. 
hotels is inching higher. Occupancy rates in April and May began to rise as travelers headed back to executing their 
travel plans. According to Statista, occupancy in hotels across Americas was 23.5% in April. However, in the week 
ending May 23, hotels across the United States had occupancy of 35.4%.Finally, according to data by 
Transportation Security Administration, total number of travelers rose to 352,947 on May 31 from 87,534 on Apr 14. 
This indicates increasing activity on the front of airline bookings.5 Stocks to WatchKeeping the aforementioned 
factors in mind, we have, rounded up five stocks from the select industries that have good potential for growth. All 
these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank

Jun 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In a customer-friendly 
initiative, Alaska Air Group's ALK[1] subsidiary Alaska Airlines announced three new promotions that customers 
and Mileage Plan members can enjoy.Apart from guaranteeing 2020 elite status through 2021, the airline is 
extending a 50% bonus of elite qualifying miles for flights taken through the end of this year.For the first time, 
Alaska Airlines Visa cardholders have the chance to earn elite qualifying miles. They also have the option to earn 
2,500 miles for every $5,000 spent on purchases from Jun 1 through Sep 30, 2020. The maximum limit is 10,000 
elite qualifying miles for a single cardholder. Alaska Airlines Visa consumer cardholders can earn two miles for 
every dollar spent, up to $1,500, for restaurant and related purchases, including delivery services from Jun 1 
through Jul 31, 2020.Price PerformanceShares of Alaska Air Group, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have 
plunged more than 43% since the beginning of February due to coronavirus-led travel demand woes. 
With easing travel restrictions, U.S. airlines have been seeing improvements in demand over the past few weeks. 
To take advantage of the situation, Alaska Air Group's peers like United Airlines UAL[2] and Delta Air Lines DAL[3] 
plan to increase capacity. United Airlines, carrying a Zacks Rank #3, will be increasing trans-Atlantic service from 
Washington, D.C. and San Francisco to some European cities, starting next month. Additionally, the carrier will 
resume flights to Tokyo-Haneda, Hong Kong, Singapore and Seoul. It will also boost capacity across Latin America 
and the Caribbean.Last month, Delta's CEO Edward Bastian stated that he hopes to add around 200 flights in June 
and another 200 or 300 flights in July, amid signs of improvement in domestic travel demand. Delta carries a Zacks 
Rank #3.Alaska Air Group is yet to announce any such flight expansion measures.A Key PickA better-ranked stock 
in the same space is Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4], carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of

Jun 02, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With passenger 
revenues declining due to the coronavirus-triggered bearish air-travel demand, Delta Air Lines DAL[1] is focusing on 
its cargo-only flights. To this end, the carrier decided to operate daily flights connecting Seoul-Incheon with Detroit. 
Moreover, cargo-special flights will operate four-times a week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday) on the 
Incheon-Los Angeles route and thrice a week (Monday, Thursday, Saturday) connecting Incheon and Atlanta.The 
decision is aimed at keeping the supply chain of medical equipment like surgical masks, gloves, gowns and other 
protective gear operative between the United States and Asia. 
While Delta will use its Boeing 777-200ER aircraft to operate the Atlanta and Los Angeles flights, Airbus A350-900 
aircraft will ply on the Incheon-Detroit routes for carrying cargo.Both jets have the capacity to carry up to 42 tons of 
cargo on international routes. Per the schedule, the cargo on arrival in Atlanta, Detroit or Los Angeles will be 
transferred to domestic passenger flights so that they can be shipped to other destinations in the country.Further 
deepening its focus on cargo-only flights, Delta launched its Cargo Control Center in Atlanta to support global cargo 
services on a daily basis. This new facility will address all aspects of cargo transportation and management, which 
in turn, will ease the tracking of air shipments, trucks, mail and freight, both domestically and internationally.With 
passenger demand plummeting, the cargo-only operations might help Delta recoup a bit of its lost revenues.Zacks 
Rank &#38; Key PicksDelta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks 
Transportation[2] sector are Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], Teekay Tankers Ltd. TNK[4] and Nordic American 
Tankers Ltd. NAT[5], each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here.[6] Ryanair has an impressive earnings history, having outperformed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 62.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate 
for Teekay Tanker's current-year earnings has been revised 35.6% upward in the past 60 days.The Zacks 
Consensus Estimate for Nordic American Tankers' current-year earnings has moved 14.1% north in the past 60 
days.5 Stocks to Soar Past the Pandemic: In addition to the companies you learned about above, we invite you to

Jun 02, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per Reuters[1], Delta Air 
Lines Inc DAL[2] is working with its pilots' union to avoid involuntary furloughs of more than 2,300 pilots.Over the 
weekend, the airline carried out a reshuffling process to align its staff size to flying plans for summer 2021. In a 
"surplus" bid, Delta asked employees to petition available positions at one of its U.S. pilot bases. Following the 
results, the carrier will transfer approximately 7,000 pilots to different locations or aircraft types, per Delta's Master 
Executive Council ('MEC') of the Air Line Pilots Association ('ALPA'). However, 2,327 pilots remained 
unassigned.Delta, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), stated that the bid is "to better align our staffing with our future 
flying demand." The carrier is "looking at all options to mitigate or minimize furloughs and will continue working with 
ALPA in the coming weeks to explore those options."Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price

employees. Employees availing these options will be provided with cash severance, full healthcare coverage and 
travel benefits.The airlines' need to reduce workforce to match the current demand scenario has become 
pronounced lately. Last week, United Airlines Holdings UAL[5] revealed plans to cut 13 officer jobs as part of its 
cost-cutting measures to deal with the coronavirus-led slump in air travel demand. Earlier, American Airlines Group 
AAL[6] notified that it would cut jobs in the management and support staff team by 30%.Both United Airlines and

Jun 01, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Germany's flag carrier Lufthansa 
agreed Saturday to a €9 billion[1] coronavirus rescue plan from Berlin. The government on Monday announced the 
aid package that aims to keep the airliner going through the coronavirus crisis. The European Union however, said 
that, as a condition, bailouts must include measures that would maintain a level playing field for other companies. 
Lufthansa said in a statement it had agreed to the compromise worked out between Germany and the EU. Under 
the new rules, the airline will have to remove up to four aircraft from Munich and Frankfurt airports, to allow 
competitors to take the slots. The slots will be re-allocated through a bid process. Ryanair and easyJet are both 
thought to be interested. The bailout deal will also include the German government taking a 20% stake in the airline 
group, making it its biggest shareholder. As countries banned international travel in March, Lufthansa grounded[2] 
around 700 aircraft of its 763-unit fleet and reduced[3] its passenger capacity by 95%. [ 1]:

Jun 01, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per Reuters[1], United 
Airlines Holdings UAL[2] plans to cut 13 officer jobs as part of its cost-cutting measures to deal with the 
coronavirus-led slump in air travel demand.The 13 officer positions will be eliminated effective Jun 15. Eight of 
those removed will continue to be attached with the company through Sep 30. Due to the low-demand environment 
and the need to operate a smaller airline, United Airlines had warned of a 30% reduction in its administrative staff in 
October. To avoid furloughs, the carrier is launching programs for employees to accept voluntary leave or early 
retirement. The company has offered several of its flight attendants with voluntary separation packages.With a 
foresight to operate a smaller airline, last week American Airlines Group AAL[3], carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), 
revealed plans to cut jobs in the management and support staff team by 30%, to cut costs and match the current

the past few weeks, prompting the carriers to increase capacity. 
United Airlines, carrying a Zacks Rank #3, will be increasing trans-Atlantic service from Washington, D.C. and San 
Francisco to some of the cities in Europe, starting next month. Additionally, the carrier will resume flights to Tokyo-
Haneda, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Seoul. It will also boost capacity across Latin America and the Caribbean. 
United Airlines' July capacity is expected to be approximately 75% below normal. This represents an improvement 
over its current schedule, which is 90% below usual capacity.Last month, Delta Air Lines DAL[6] CEO Edward 
Bastian stated that he hopes to add around 200 flights in June and another 200 or 300 flights in July, amid signs of 
improvement in domestic travel demand. Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3.A Key PickA better-ranked stock in the

quarantine about to be imposed on arrivals to Britain will 'kill' the travel industry and have the same impact as the 
complete closure of the nation's borders, ministers have been warned.Aviation leaders urged the government 
yesterday to rethink the plan, saying it was the equivalent of hanging up a 'Britain is closed' sign. They warned that 
it would damage the economic recovery at a crucial time and cost thousands of jobs in the travel, tourism and 
hospitality industries. 
They were joined in their opposition by tourism bodies and politicians. From June 8, all travellers to Britain, 
including Britons returning home[1], will be forced to spend two weeks isolating at a single address even if they 
have come from countries with few coronavirus infections. Arrivals will have to reveal where they will be staying and 
anyone not complying faces a fine of up to 1,000. Amid the backlash against the plan, research by the International 
Air Transport Association (Iata) showed that Britons were 'relatively keen to travel again'. It found that 48 per cent of 
people in the UK would be willing to travel within a 'month or two' of the threat posed by Covid-19 being controlled. 
This was above the international average and higher than the US, Japan, Germany, Canada and Australia. 
However, Iata said that the quarantine would destroy any attempt to resume international travel into or from Britain. 
Simon McNamara, of the trade group, said: 'As the concern about Covid-19 recedes, if the quarantine is still in 
place people are not going to travel. It is not a question of being prepared to go through quarantine because they 
want to travel. All the evidence we have is that this will just kill travel. Governments seem to have a stark choice. 
They cannot pretend that quarantine enables their international travel markets to open up, because the evidence is 
quite simply not there. If they persist with quarantine it is effectively the same as locking down your country.' In 
contrast Italy is rolling out the red carpet for foreign visitors to try to rebuild its economy. On Wednesday a rule 
requiring new arrivals to self-isolate for two weeks will be scrapped for visitors from Europe, including Britain. On 
quarantine, the Iata intervention adds to the voices calling on ministers to ditch the idea. The head of British 
Airways has already criticised the plan, and Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, described it over the 
weekend as 'a complete shambles' and unenforceable. Tim Alderslade, of Airlines UK, which represents British 
carriers, said yesterday: 'The quarantine will destroy jobs and put back the recovery at the exact time that other 
countries are opening up their borders. It is just about the worst thing they could do if the aim is to restart the 
economy and get aviation and tourism moving again.' Brian Strutton, of Balpa, the pilots' union, added: 'It's like 
Quarantine will destroy travel firms putting thousands of jobs at risk
hanging up a 'Britain is closed' sign and the whole economy will lose out as a result, not only delaying recovery from 
the coronavirus crisis but also putting at risk our preparedness for full Brexit at the end of this year.' Analysis of 12 
countries compared those that had already imposed a two-week quarantine and nations that had banned inward 
travel this month. It found no difference in bookings to travel to the countries, irrespective of the measure, 
suggesting that quarantine had the same impact as a complete ban. Iata has called instead for safe-flying 
measures, including temperature screening at airports and the mandatory wearing of facemasks on all flights. About 
50 Tory backbenchers are against the plan. The former Brexit secretary David Davis said: 'The government should 
be looking for the maximum level of relaxation [of border restrictions] consistent with safety. That means a lot of air 
bridges [reciprocal arrangements between countries] and where there aren't air bridges, the option for tests and 
inspections to eliminate the quarantine or limit it.' The Home Office has defended the plan, saying that decisions 
have 'got to be led by the science'. Some countries have shut their borders to Britons. Spain joined Greece 
yesterday in excluding British tourists from a list of countries allowed to enter when restrictions are lifted, because of 
the UK's high infection rate. Read more: Quarantine will destroy travel firms putting thousands of jobs at risk[2] [ 1]:

May 29, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Spirit Airlines 
SAVE[1] have appreciated 28.4% in the past seven days, outperforming its industry'[2]s 10.8% increase.The price 
performance is no doubt very impressive in these coronavirus-ravaged times. Lets delve into the details to unearth 
the reasons for this outperformance. Spirit Airlines presented a rosy picture at an investor presentation. 
Management stated that its low-cost structure has enabled it to withstand the current coronavirus-led crisis. The 
average daily cash burn rate of $4 million is expected to improve in the second half of 2020. In a bid to preserve 
cash, the carrier reduced the current-year planned gross capital expenses by $235 million.To bolster its liquidity 
position, the carrier sealed a deal with the U.S. treasury Department for a payroll support of approximately $335 
million (of the total amount, grants worth $264 million are not required to be paid back while a $71-million fund is 
obtained in unsecured low-interest loan) under the CARES Act. Low fuel costs are also providing a cushion to the 
bottom line. Notably, average fuel cost per gallon declined 13.4% in the March quarter to $1.81.Moreover, Spirit 
Airlines gained traction from the recent positive vibes surrounding this sector, which has been hit hard by the 
coronavirus pandemic. Notably, booking trends have been improving. Moreover, there has been an uptick in air 
travel in the United States since the Memorial Day weekend.Data from Transportation Security Administratio[3]n 
(TSA) shows that 340,769 passengers went through TSA checkpoints on the Memorial Day. Although the figure 
represents an 86.4% plunge from the year-ago number, it indicates a more than 100% surge from the lows in April. 
Zacks Rank &#38; Key PicksSpirit Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the 
transportation[4] sector include Frontline Limited FRO[5], Scorpio Tankers ( STNG[6] and Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[7]. While Frontline and Scorpio Tankers sport a Zacks Rank #1, Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #2

May 29, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  American Airlines 
Group AAL[1] is planning to cut jobs in the management and support staff ('MSS') team by 30%, per a letter to 
employees from Elise Eberwein, the company's executive vice president of People and Global Engagement.The 
airline is opening a new voluntary early-out program for MSS team members to volunteer through Jun 10. In case 
there are not enough volunteers, the company will resort to involuntary layoffs. Those laid off will remain under 
payroll through Sep 30 and continue to receive full compensation as per guidelines of the CARES Act.The staff-
reduction move is part of the carrier's efforts to cut costs, the most significant being expenses incurred on 
compensations and benefits, as it prepares to operate a 'smaller airline for the foreseeable future,' thanks to 
coronavirus-led 
travel 
demand

price[2] | American Airlines Group Inc. Quote[3] As many as 39,000 American Airlines' employees have voluntarily 
applied for unpaid leave or early retirement. The airline in its part plans to operate roughly 100 fewer aircraft next 
summer.Apart from MSS staff reduction, the airline announced other cost-cutting measures, including suspension 
of the MSS merit program for 2020 and canceling an incentive plan.Once the MSS team is right sized, American 
Airlines, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects to evaluate employee reductions in its frontline team. Here too, 
the company plans to launch a voluntary leave and early out program (likely in June), before contemplating 
involuntary furloughs.The need to reduce workforce in order to operate a smaller airline matching the current 
demand scenario has also been felt by other U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines DAL[4] and United Airlines UAL[5]. 
Delta is offering voluntary early retirement options[6] and buyout packages to employees. United Airlines is planning 
a similar move. Additionally, the airline has given a heads up of a 30% reduction in its administrative staff.Both 
Delta and United Airlines carry a Zacks Rank #3.A Key PickA better-ranked stock in the same space is Ryanair

May 28, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  The British airline EasyJet[1] 
announced its plans to cut up to 30% of its employees, to save costs amid the coronavirus crisis. 'To effect the 
restructure of our business, EasyJet will shortly launch an employee consultation process on proposals to reduce 
staff numbers by up to 30%, reflecting the reduced fleet, the optimisation of our network and bases, improved 
productivity as well as the promotion of more efficient ways of working', the airline said. 
The company employed 15,000 people at the beginning of the year. Earlier, it announced it would restart flights on 
June 15, but added that it does not expect to reach the 2019 levels of demand until at least 2023. In March, the 
airline grounded its entire fleet[2] as a response to the global travel bans aimed at containing the coronavirus 
pandemic. 'We realise these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will 
impact our people - but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long term', CEO Johan Lundgren said. 
Other airlines announced major layoffs as well. Ryanair said it would cut 15% of its staff, Wizz intends to reduce its 
workforce by 19%, and British Airways is set to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforce. [ 1]:

May 28, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  At a conference held on 
Wednesday, American Airlines Group AAL[1] informed that it will not file for bankruptcy protection. Reportedly[2], 
there were talks that a major U.S. airline might go out of business once the government aid for it expires.The 
company's chief executive officer Doug Parker stated, "Bankruptcy is failure. We're not going to do that." He feels 
that no airline is likely to 'go by the wayside as a result of this crisis."He further predicted that the U.S. airline 
industry is likely to shrink by 10-20% in summer 2021 and its rebound would depend on passenger demand and 
revenues generated. With easing travel restrictions, American Airlines, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is seeing 
modest increases in passenger numbers. New bookings have been more than the number of cancellations over 
past few weeks. During the U.S. Memorial Day weekend, the carrier's aircraft was filled about 56%. The passenger 
load is encouraging although it reflects a significantly reduced capacity. The carrier is operating only about 20% of 
its 
usual 
schedule 
compared 
to 
a 
year 
ago.American

price[3] | American Airlines Group Inc. Quote[4] U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines DAL[5] and United Airlines UAL[6] 
are also witnessing increases in travel demand. Earlier this month, Delta revealed plans to increase its summer 
capacity amid signs of improvement in domestic travel demand. The company's CEO Edward Bastian hopes to add 
around 200 flights in June and another 200 or 300 in July.In an SEC filing, United Airlines stated that as of May 18, 
the airline had witnessed reduction in cancellation rates and a 'moderate improvement in demand' in domestic 
markets as well as some international routes for the remainder of the second quarter of 2020.Both Delta and United 
Airlines carry a Zacks Rank #3.A Key PickA better-ranked stock in the same space is Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[7]

May 27, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair said it would challenge the 
German government's decision to award €9 bn state aid to Lufthansa, citing that it breaches EU state aid rules and 
results in a 'monopoly' in the German domestic market. 'The German Govt continues to ignore EU rules when it 
suits them to subsidise large German companies, but then lectures every other EU Govt about respecting the rules 
when they ignore them,' Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement on Tuesday. 
'Ryanair will appeal against this latest example of illegal state aid to Lufthansa, which will massively distort 
competition,' he added. The budget airline's chief executive heavily criticised the German company for being 
'addicted to state aid,' adding that'whenever there is a crisis, Lufthansa's first reflex is to put its hand in the German 
Government's pocket.' Citing that Lufthansa has been asking for support from several countries, including Austria, 
Switzerland and Belgium, Ryanair's CEO supported thatthe German company 'stumbles around Europe sucking up 
as much State Aid as it can possibly gather,'while other airlines are surviving on 'just payroll support schemes'. 
O'Leary's statement came after Lufthansa announced[1] on Monday it was approved for a €9 bn bailout package 
from Germany's Economic Stabilisation Fund, to survive the Coronavirus crisis. Lufthansa's bailout needs to be 
approved 
both 
by 
the 
company's 
shareholders 
and 
the 
European 
Commission.

May 27, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, Latin 
American carrier LATAM Airlines Group LTM[1] filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection due to the coronavirus-induced 
fast-evaporating air-travel demand. Notably, the sinking air-travel demand caused many carriers to post losses in 
the March quarter, the latest being another Latin American carrier Azul AZUL[2], which it confirmed while 
announcing first-quarter financial numbers in the previous week[3].Delta Air Lines DAL[4] also grabbed headlines in 
the past week with its CEO Edward Bastian stating that he hopes to add around 200 flights in June and another 200 
or 300 flights in July. Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] expressed its displeasure over the government-
backed EUR9 billion bailout package to German carrier Deutsche Lufthansa DLAKY[6].Wrap-Up on the Past 
Week's Key Headlines1. LATAM Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States as it 
grapples with a dramatic drop in air travel demand amid coronavirus concerns. Along with the Latin American 
carrier, its affiliates in Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and the United States are part of the bankruptcy filing, while 
those in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay are not. 
Despite the restructuring, LATAM Airlines and its affiliates will continue usual passenger and cargo operations[7].2. 
Delta expects to increase its summer capacity amid signs of improvement in domestic travel demand. To comply 
with social distancing norms amid coronavirus concerns, Delta, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has capped 
passenger load to only 60% of the total number of seats. Additionally, the airline is making constant efforts to 
sanitize aircraft in order to encourage passengers to travel[8].You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[9].3. In a bid to win back passengers, United Airlines UAL[10] launched a new 
cleanliness program — United CleanPlus — in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic and Clorox to combat the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The deal with Cleveland Clinic aims to promote United Airlines' cleaning, safety and social 
distancing protocols. Initially, Clorox products will be used at the gates and terminals of United Airlines hub airports, 
Chicago and Denver[11].4. Per aReuters report[12], Ryanair challenged the impending government rescue package 
for Lufthansa. The European low-cost carrier fears that the huge state aid, which will become effective following 
approval by the European Commission (expected shortly), will distort competition and deny a level playing field to 
low-cost carriers like Ryanair. The package, once effective, might offer Lufthansa unfair advantage as it may 
'engage in below-cost selling.'5. Spirit Airlines presented a rosy picture at an investor presentation. Management 
stated that its low-cost structure has enabled it to withstand the current coronavirus-led crisis. The current average 
Airline Stock Roundup: LTM Files for Bankruptcy Protection, DAL , RYAAY in Focus
daily cash burn rate of $4 million is expected to improve in the second half of 2020. In a bid to preserve cash, the 
carrier reduced the current-year planned gross capital expenses by $235 million. To bolster its liquidity position, the 
carrier has finalized a deal with the U.S. treasury Department for payroll support of approximately $335 million 
($264 million in grants which it does not have to pay back and $71 million in unsecured low-interest loan) under the 
CARES Act. Low fuel costs are also providing cushion to the bottom line.Performance The following table shows 
the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the past six months.The table above 
shows that all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week, resulting in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
gaining 13.5% to $50.07. Over the course of six months, the Index depreciated 54%.What's Next in the Airline

Europe's biggest low budget airline has said a €9 billion government rescue package for the German flag carrier 
amounts to an "illegal subsidy." Ryanair's CEO said Lufthansa is "addicted to state aid."Ryanair said Tuesday it 
would contest a €9 billion ($9.9 billion) aid package from the German government to prop up Lufthansa. 
The aid package must still be cleared by the European Commission's competition arm. In a statement, the Ireland-
based budget carrier's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said the government-backed aid would make it harder for budget

negotiation, theGerman government and Lufthansa struck a deal on state aid including secured loans and a 20% 
government shareholder stake in the airline. But first, EU competition regulators must evaluate whether the 
government aid package restricts competition in the European aviation sector.Under EU law, member states are 
generally prohibited from providing financial aid to national companies because it can distort fair competition in the

May 25, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Just as many European countries 
are starting to open up again, the United Kingdom announced plans to introduce a 14-day quarantine for travellers 
arriving from abroad. Interior minister Priti Patel said that, from June 8, all international arrivals, including returning 
Britons, will have to self-isolate and provide details of where they will be staying. The rules will not apply to Ireland, 
which has a free-movement agreement with the UK. Freight drivers, medical professionals and seasonal 
agricultural workers[1] will also be excluded. Those breaking the rules would face a $1,220 fine or prosecution, the 
government warned. 'Now we are past the peak of this virus, we must take steps to guard against imported cases 
triggering a resurgence of this deadly disease', Patel said at a news conference. The plan was condemned by 
airlines, business groups and politicians. Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary accused ministers of making the quarantine 
plan up as they go along. Others have questioned why Britain did not introduce quarantine during the worst of the 
country's coronavirus outbreak. Arriving passengers will also be 'encouraged' to download a contact-tracing app[2] 
that authorities are developing, and are hoping to have it in place by June. [ 1]:

View original post here[2]. Authored by Bill Blain via MorningPorridge.com,[3]  'The two aims of the Party are to 
conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought.'  40 
million unemployed Americans. Pretty powerful piece of BBC reporting last night on 5-hour queues for upstate NY 
middle class food banks. 'These people have now missed 5 or 6 paychecks and they need to eat', said a charity 
worker. 
A protestor demanding reopening screamed into a microphone:'What is the point in saving people from coronavirus 
and then letting them starve instead?' America looks divided.  It's not just them. The mood is getting uglier. A chum 
at a leading investment firm has just been quietly told he won't be getting paid the bonus he expected - it been 
worded as deferral, but looks permanent. He says he puffed up and cited his rights but got brutally slapped down: 
told he's lucky to have a job, and if he complains or says anything he's on furlough and out the door immediately 
thereafter. He's terrified. He's highly levered, has school fees to pay, and feels trapped. It's made a bad social 
situation worse, stuck in a small London house with kids and a now very unhappy wife.  Repeat the same scenario 
some 20 million times around the globe - as the upper middle classes are 'disciplined'. Job losses are accumulating 
across the global economy. But don't worry, your Pension plan, Super or 401 is doing just fine for now  A 
particularly cynical client reckons rising fear and job losses are as positive a reason to buy stocks as any he's 
heard. Companies are grabbing the virus opportunity to rationalise, cut headcount, cut wages, and axe extraneous 
departments. As a result; bottom lines are improving as they become more efficient and productive! Everyone 
expects 2nd and 3rd quarter earning wipe-outs, but this is 'capitalism in action' and earnings could surprise to the 
upside as costs as slashed.  When I commented y'day about the importance of 'Social' in ESG investing I was 
branded a communist on the website.You can call me a complete Bolshevik; but companies planning to slash 
payroll to increase dividends in this landscape deserve strung up. Sadly.. it will happen. I guess we better get used 
to it. Have you read 1984?  Meanwhile, Lufthansa is finally going to get its $9 bln German govt bailout. Emirates are 
looking to retire their A-380s. Ryanair expects passengers will flout quarantine rules and take holidays abroad 
anyway I can just imagine:2 weeks in Marbs followed by 3 months in the Costa Scrubs.  But the first order news this 
morning is all about China    This morning the Chinese sent a signal round the globe when they didn't set a target 
for economic growth for the first time in 30 years. The reality is the People's Central Committee doesn't want to 
reveal anything that hints at just how bad the economic reality is in China.  There are all kinds of theories about 
'The Mood Is Getting Uglier' And China's Not Helping
China - you have to cut thru them to focus on what's real. Some say China is on a deliberate collision course with 
the US. It's the end of the US empire as China becomes the new pre-eminent global superpower. A trade war with 
the US could soon turn into a hot war. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Sith China Seas and the Spratlys are 
flashpoints set to ignite. A slowing China/ the Virus is a weapon of deliberate economic warfare because of the 
damage and instability it will create across the West. Etc, etc  The bottom line is China also suffers. I suspect the 
truth is the Communist party knows it's in serious trouble honouring its compact with the people - keep them happy, 
make them rich and they don't care who's in power. The compact looks wobbly. This is going to be a massive test 
for China, and the chances of collateral damage are huge as its responses impact global trade, destabilise 
overseas entanglements and lead to conflict in international organisations where China and the US face each other.  
Whatever I say about China, I bet I get called a shill or an agipropbot of the PCC for even suggesting the Chinese 
might love their children too.  The party would like us to believe China can achieve a face-saving V-Shaped 
recovery - but it looks unlikely. The economy took a massive hit (industrial production only recovered 4% in April 
after a 13.5% crash over Q1). 20% of the migrant workers who assemble everything from iPhones to Electric 
Scooters never returned to work. The domestic debt markets are as perilous as anywhere else.  While workers in 
the state sector are protected - it's a declining piece of the Chinese economy. It's been the Chinese private sector 
that's driven growth, and it's in exactly the same place as the rest of the global economy: being forced to shutter 
production and layoff workers - to a far greater extent than officials will admit. Incomes are falling, consumption is 
waning, and folk are focused on keeping what they have.  The issue for China is how to get the private sector 
working again before unemployment and declining wealth causes a social issue. They can no more afford a trade 
war with the west crippling any domestic recovery.Which is why the Chinese also announced this morning their 
intention to implement the new trade deal with the US.That's a big de-escalation, but a gesture they had to make. 
It's a big risk strategy that could embarrass the party - the main one being just how fast and loose will Trump play 
with new threats and demands in this election year.  The trade deal news has to weighed against the potential 
damageimplementation of National Security Law in Hong Kong - also announced this morning.That is bound to 
trigger a new wave of protests and revulsion across the West. The party has done it because it's a good unifier 
domestically. If there is one thing the Party has done well, its to have created a very patriotic nation where these 
terrible Hong Kong Western Stooges have made the ultimate insults to the flag and anthem, thus they are class 
enemies and must be purged.  And if disciplining Hong Kong doesn't unite the people.. then there is always the 
convenient lie about the patriotic duty to restore Taiwan to the motherland. (The truth is Taiwan was never really 
part of China except briefly - it could well become China's Troubled Ireland if it ever does..)  All of which means XI 
has raised the stakes. If the government can't deliver wealth and prosperity - social unrest and wider democracy 
calls become a real possibility. He needs to reopen trade to do that.  Interestingly, it's clear the Party does take the 
people seriously - unlike the final days of the Soviet empire in the 1980s. One of the reasons China has become 
such a strong proponent of renewable energy and EVs is its scarred environment - the result of 50 years of 
industrial growth imperatives and coal power which did enormous environmental damage, poisoning the landscape, 
water course and public health. It's a factor the government is now addressing to maintain its social compact.  This 
is going to be an interesting weekend in terms of how the China story plays out. Although the immediate market 
reaction has been negative, avoiding a global trade war would be a massive real positive development. [ 1]:

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/easyjet-to-resume-flights-next-month-with-strict-face-mask-rule/EasyJet says 
it plans to resume a small number of flights next month with strict safety protocols for passengers and crew 
alike.Top of the measures, the no-frills carrier said, would be the wearing of face masks for all those aboard its 
aircraft. 
The company said it would likely operate domestic flights within the UK and France from 15 June with the only 
international service being Gatwick to Nice initially. The UK airports to see the limited domestic services return will 
be Bristol, Birmingham, Gatwick, Liverpool, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Belfast, easyJet added. 
Shares were more than 2.5% up in early trading after a plunge of 60% in the year to date. The airline made its 
announcement as it faces a series of headaches away from flight operations - largely grounded by COVID-19 since 
March. It revealed on Tuesday a hacking of its digital systems that exposed personal details of nine million 
customers. Easyjet has furloughed thousands of staff and borrowed 600m under a government-backed financing 
scheme as it seeks to shield itself from the effects of the coronavirus crisis that has hit the industry hard, with BA[1], 
Ryanair[2] and Virgin Atlantic collectively planning 18,000 job losses[3]. It said that the cautious commencement of 
flights would only go ahead with a series of measures agreed with regulators and in-line with the advice of national 
governments. The Luton-based airline looks set to be the second operator to resume flights after Wizz Air restarted 
services from the town's airport earlier this month. BA and Ryanair are targeting July. Johan Lundgren, the easyJet 
chief executive, said of its plans: 'These are small and carefully planned steps that we are taking to gradually 
resume operations. 'We will continue to closely monitor the situation across Europe so that when more restrictions 
are lifted the schedule will continue to build over time to match demand, while also ensuring we are operating 
efficiently and on routes that our customers want.' Read more: EasyJet to resume flights next month with strict face

May 21, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We recently issued an 
updated report on Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1].The company, like other carriers, is bearing the brunt of 
plummeting air-travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's fiscal 2020 profits were hurt by more 
than €40 million. The airline's traffic fell more than 5 million in the period due to travel restrictions and aircraft 
groundings. With apprehensions about fleet grounding in April, May and June, the carrier expects to operate less 
than 1% of its total scheduled flights in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.Consequently, Ryanair expects to incur a loss 
of more than €200 million in the fiscal first quarter. 
During fiscal 2021, the carrier expects to transport less than 80 million passengers that indicates an approximate 
50% drop from its original target of 154 million passengers.Additionally, the company is taking a hit from the Boeing 
737 MAX groundings. Due to delivery delays of the aircraft, the company does not expect to receive its first MAX 
aircraft before October 2020. High fuel costs are also hurting Ryanair's bottom line. Notably, fuel bill increased 14% 
year over year in fiscal 2020.However, Ryanair's strong liquidity position looks impressive. Ryanair's cash and cash 
equivalents at the end of fiscal 2020 stood at €2.57 million, higher than short-term debt of €382.3 million. This 
indicates that the company has enough cash to meet its short-term debt burden.Ryanair Holdings PLC Price

The German flag carrier says it's close to sealing a €9 billion state rescue deal to help it survive the pandemic. 
Europe's second-biggest airline grounded 95% of its fleet due to global border and travel curbs.Lufthansa is closing 
in on a state bailout worth €9 billion ($9.9 billion) that would see the German government take a 20% state in the 
airline group. 
In a filing with the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on Wednesday evening, the national flag carrier said talks are at an 
"advanced stage."The airline added that if the deal proceeds, the government would receive two seats on the 
supervisory board, but it would only exercise its full voting rights in exceptional circumstances, such as to protect 
the firm against a takeover.The statement noted that some €3billion of the cash injection would come from the KfW 
state bank, with the remainder from the government's economic stabilization fund, which was set up to deliver aid to 
businesses affected by the pandemic.A so-called convertible bond from the fund is to be added to this share, which 
can be exchanged for another 5% plus one share.Reuters cited sources involved in the negotiations said the 
stabilization fund had not yet put forward a final offer but was expected to do so on Thursday.Limits on 
management pay, dividendsLufthansa's statement said the firm expected conditions of the deal to include the 
waiver of future dividend payments and limits on management pay, adding the package would have to be approved 
by the European Commission.Read more: Ryanair struggles on without state aid, but still well-placed to fly high 
againIt added that the firm hoped the negotiations would be concluded "promptly."Europe's second-largest airline 
faces severe financial difficulties after travel bans forced the grounding of 95% of its fleet — some 700 planes. The 
company is estimated to be losing in the region of a million euros an hour at present.Last week, the carrier 
confirmed plans to restart hundreds of flights from mid-June.Protracted talks over controlLufthansa's management 
has been in talks with the German government for weeks over a rescue deal to help it cope with what is expected to 
be a protracted travel slump. But the two sides have struggled to agree on how much control the government 
should get in return for support.Rivals such as Franco-Dutch group Air France-KLM and US carriers American 
Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines have also sought state aid.Besides its own services, Lufthansa owns 
several other European carriers, including Austrian Airlines, Swiss International, Brussels Airlines and 
Eurowings.The Cologne-headquartered firm, which has its main operating base in Frankfurt, generated revenues of 
€36.4 billion in the 2019 financial year.DW editors send out a selection of news and features eahc day at 1830UTC.

Berlin's busiest airport will close on June 15 for at least two months, though authorities say the closure may be 
permanent. The measure aims to save money amid ongoing travel bans owing to the coronavirus pandemic.Berlin's 
Tegel Airport will temporarily close from June 15 to save costs amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, officials 
announced on Wednesday.The federal government and the states of Berlin and Brandenburg announced the 
decision during a video conference with shareholders. 
Airport operator FBB will close Tegel for around two months, aiming to save around €200,000 ($220,000) a day."In 
the next few months we will see if the capital region needs one or two airports," FBB chief Lütke Dalrup told the 
Deutsche Presse-Agentur."Now it is about taking the next steps responsibly," Daldrup added. "Our next job is to 
ensure the recovery of the air industry and not hinder it."Read more: Berlin's new airport: 'This time it will 
happen'Could the closure be permanent?Berlin Tegel is normally the city's busiest airport. All flight traffic will be 
handled by Berlin Schönefeld airport which operates mainly budget airlines like easyJet and Ryanair. At least 24 
million people flew via Tegel in 2019, making it Germany's fourth-busiest airport.A new airport for the German 
capital, Berlin Brandenburg, was scheduled to open to replace Tegel on October 31 this year, but this plan has had 
doubt cast upon it owing to coronavirus restrictions.However, FBB has remained optimistic that Berlin Brandenburg 
will open as planned, and have duly not ruled out the possibility that Tegel may never reopen.Tegel and Schönefeld 
have seen only around 2,000 passengers per day in recent weeks.ed/aw (dpa, Reuters)Every evening at 1830

https://www.fft.ie/ryanair-2020-financial-results-traffic-increase/31876#respond Ryanair has cut its annual traffic 
target by a further 20%, as the company reports profits after tax of €1bn for the year ending 31st March. 
For the reported financial year, the airline grew traffic by 4% up to 149m passengers, with revenue per guest up by 
6%. Most of Ryanair's fleet was grounded from mid-March by EU Government flight bans and restrictions. These 
groundings reduced March and full year traffic by over 5m guests and cut FY20 profits by over €40m. The company 
said it was unable to provide a forecast for the coming year due to COVID 19, with chief executive Michael O'Leary 
saying it was essentially guesswork. 'For the next 12 months it's obviously impossible for us to today to give you 
any guidance on either traffic numbers or on profits,' said O'Leary in a video presentation. 'We have no idea 
because it is entirely subject to passenger numbers, yields and the lifting of government restrictions.' The airline 
said it expects to carry 'somewhere under' 80m passengers in the coming year. This estimation is down from an 
original target of 154m, which was later revised downwards to 100m. Ryanair has also warned it will look at pulling 
out of some airports in Europe as part of a cost cutting exercise. Michael O'Leary said the airline would look at loss-
making bases in Spain, Germany and the UK initially. The company has gone on a cost cutting drive in recent 
weeks, with 3,000 pilots and cabin crew as well as 250 HQ staff likely to lose their jobs. The company has again 
expressed its support for Boeing's grounded 737-MAX-200 aircraft: 'We remain fans of, and committed to, these 
'gamechanger' aircraft with 4% more seats &#38; 16% lower fuel burn, which will transform Ryanair's cost base for 
the next decade'.

May 19, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] incurred a loss of $1.16 per share in fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 (ended Mar 31, 2020), narrower than the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.29. The loss deteriorated year over year.Quarterly revenues of $1,323 
million also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,189 million. However, the top line suffered year over 
year due to the coronavirus-led drop in air travel demand.Fiscal 2020 ResultsRyanair's profit after tax plunged 
26.7% year over year in fiscal 2020. The impact of coronavirus-led low demand for air travel was more than €40 
million on profits. Fiscal 2020 earnings per share came in at €0.58 per share, down 24.4% year over year. Total 
revenues ascended 10% to €8.5 billion owing to a 4% rise in traffic (149 million guests). Traffic decreased by more 
than 5 million due to travel restrictions and aircraft groundings, thanks to coronavirus. 
Load factor deteriorated to 95% from 96% in the year-ago period. Ancillary revenues rose 20% year over year for 
full fiscal 2020.The airlines' fuel costs increased 14% year over year. Additionally, non-fuel unit costs rose 4%,

Holdings PLC Quote[3] Balance Sheet HighlightsRyanair, carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), currently has a 
cash balance of €4.1 billion. Through stringent cost-cutting measures, the company has been able to reduce its 
average weekly cash burn rate to around €60 million in May, from approximately €200 million in 
March.OutlookRyanair expects to operate less than 1% of its total scheduled flights in the first quarter of fiscal 
2021. From July onward some of the flight services are expected to resume. However, with bookings anticipated to 
be affected by public health restrictions and mandatory quarantines, the carrier expects to carry only 50% of its 
second-quarter traffic guidance of 44.6 million guests.The carrier expects to incur a loss of more than €200 million 
in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of the coronavirus-induced decline in traffic and low pricing. With the 
company anticipating a rise in demand during the peak summer season, losses are expected to decrease 
sequentially in second-quarter fiscal 2021. The carrier expects to transport less than 80 million passengers during 
fiscal 2021. This indicates an approximate 50% drop from its original target of 154 million passengers. Performance 
of Other Airline StocksGol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL[4], carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reported earnings

reflect the coronavirus-induced drop in passenger demand. Meanwhile, operating revenues of $4,234 million lagged 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,397 million and declined 17.8% year over year.American Airlines AAL[7],

May 19, 2020( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Millions 
of easyJet passengers had their names, email addresses and travel details breached in a "highly sophisticated" 
cyber attack, the airline has said. The hackers obtained credit card details of over 2,200 flyers.Unknown attackers 
accessed data of roughly 9 million easyJet passengers, the budget airline said on Tuesday. 
The company "engaged leading forensic experts to investigate the issue" after detecting the "highly sophisticated" 
attack in January, easyJet chief Johan Lungren said in a statement.The hackers mostly uncovered names, emails, 
and travel details of the affected passengers. However, they also stole credit card information of 2,208 customers. 
EasyJet said that people affected in the credit card breach have already been contacted and the rest of targeted 
passengers will be contacted in the coming days.At the same time, they said there was "no evidence" that any of 
the stolen information had been misused.Read more: Social-distance flying the new normal?Fears of a fineLungren 
apologized to customers and said that companies needed to "stay agile to stay ahead of the threat."He also noted 
that "owning to COVID-19 there is heightened concern about personal data being used for online scams."The UK 
company, like most airlines around the world, was forced to ground most of its fleet due to travel restrictions 
prompted by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The carrier could now face a hefty fine from the British authorities 
over the hacking, similar to a $230 million (€210 million) penalty imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office

Airways was responsible for failing to protect the data. The airline is still appealing the decision.On Tuesday, 
easyJet said they had been working with the ICO since learning of the attack."As a result, and on the 
recommendation of the ICO, we are contacting those customers whose travel information was accessed and we are 
advising them to be extra vigilant, particularly if they receive unsolicited communications," Lungren said.Read more:

May 19, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] and Latin American carrier Azul AZUL[2] reported losses in 
first-quarter 2020 results. With coronavirus continuing to wreak havoc, the carriers have been persistently incurring 
losses for this earnings season. Notably, the likes of Spirit Airlines SAVE[3] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[4] too 
suffered losses for the March quarter, which they confirmed while announcing respective first-quarter financial 
numbers in the previous week[5].Delta Air Lines DAL[6] also grabbed headlines in the past week by virtue of its 
decision to retire its Boeing 777 fleet by the end of this year as it aims to control costs in response to the 
coronavirus-inflicted extremely bleak demand scenario.Wrap-Up on the Past Week's Key Headlines1. Azul incurred 
a loss of $1.63 per share on an adjusted basis in the first quarter of 2020, wider than the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of a loss of 50 cents. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 49 cents per 
share. 
The first-quarter results were affected by the coronavirus-induced drop in demand and depreciation of the Brazilian 
Real. Fuel cost hedging losses also weighed on the company's performance. Moreover, with capacity expansion 
outpacing traffic growth, consolidated load factor deteriorated 90 basis points to 81%[7].2. Delta, which is currently 
burning $50 million cash per day, aims to reduce its cash burn rate to zero by 2020-end. The decision to retire its 
Boeing 777 fleet is a step toward achieving this financial goal.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier aims to maintain a 
trimmed fleet size and network as well as curb itsoverall operations over the next two to three years. In line with this 
objective, the carrier already accelerated the retirement of its MD-90 aircraft, which is set to be removed in June 
2020[8]. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[9].3. Ryanair incurred a 
loss of $1.16 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 (ended Mar 31, 2020), narrower than the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.29. However, the amount of loss widened year over year. Quarterly revenues of 
$1,323 million, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,189 million. The top line also declined 
year over year due to the coronavirus-led drop in air travel demand. Moreover, Ryanair's profit after tax declined 
26.7% year over year in fiscal 2020. The impact of the coronavirus-triggered low demand for air travel was more 
than €40 million on profits. Fiscal 2020 earnings came in at €0.58 per share, down 24.4% year over year. Ryanair 
expects to operate less than 1% of its total scheduled flights in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. From July onward, 
some of the flight services are expected to be resumed.The carrier expects to incur a loss of more than €200m in 
the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of the coronavirus-induced decline in traffic and weak pricing. With the

company anticipating a rise in demand during the peak summer season, losses are expected to decrease 
sequentially in the fiscal second quarter. The carrier expects to transport less than 80 million passengers during 
fiscal 2021. This indicates an approximate 50% slump from its original target of 154 million passengers.4. At 
Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[10], the April traffic for scheduled service, measured in revenue passenger miles 
(RPMs), plunged 97% on a year-over-year basis. Scheduled capacity, calculated in available seat miles (ASMs), 
also tumbled 87.2% in the month. With traffic declining more than the contraction in capacity, load factor (or 
percentage of seats filled by passengers) deteriorated 61.7 percentage points year over year to 19.3%.5. Per a 
Reuters report[11], South-American carrier, LATAM Airlines Group LTM[12] will lay off 1400 employees (3% of its 
workforce) as it tries to combat the current low-demand scenario due to the pandemic. Notably, LATAM's Latin 
American counterparts, namely Gol Linhas GOL[13] and Azul have a sizeable proportion of their employees on 
unpaid leave.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of major airline players over the past week 
and during the past six months. The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green over the past 
week, resulting in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining 2.4% to $44.11. Over the course of six months, the index 
has depreciated 59.6%.What's Next in the Airline Space?With the first-quarter earnings season almost over, 
investors will look forward to updates from carriers to combat the coronavirus crisis.5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach

May 19, 2020( Phil's Stock World: http://www.philstockworld.com Delivered by Newstex)  Courtesy of ZeroHedge[1] 
View original post here[2]. After several weeks of economic, political and corporate earnings, things finally quiet 
down this week as Q1 earnings season comes to an end with a handful of retailers (at least the ones that aren't 
bankrupt yet) set to report. The main data release this week will be the flash PMIs for May from around the world on 
Thursday and Friday, according to DB's Jim Reid. The consensus is expecting services in Europe to bounce from 
low teens to the mid-twenties area and manufacturing to go up a few points in the thirties. The PMIs are diffusion 
indices, with respondents simply saying whether things are better or worse than the previous month so they are a 
little difficult to calibrate to growth at such extreme levels of activity but they will be a big curiosity nonetheless. 
 There's a raft of central bank events this week, including a number from the Fed. The highlights are likely to be the 
two sets of remarks from Fed Chair Powell that we mentioned above. Aside from that, there'll also be remarks to 
digest from Vice Chair Clarida and New York Fed President Williams on Thursday, as well as other regional Fed 
Presidents throughout the week. Finally on the Fed, it'll be worth keeping an eye out for the release of the minutes 
from April's meeting on Wednesday. On Friday, the ECB will also be publishing their account of the most recent 
monetary policy meeting.  Earnings season continues to wind down over the week ahead, with over 90% of the 
S&#38;P 500 companies having now reported. This week will only see a further 22 companies from the S&#38;P 
500 and 30 from the STOXX 600 announce earnings. In terms of the highlights, today we'll hear from Ryanair, 
Lufthansa and Panasonic. Then tomorrow we have Walmart and Home Depot, before Wednesday sees Lowe's, 
Target and Experian report. On Thursday, there's Nvidia, Medtronic, Intuit, TJX and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, 
and finally on Friday there's Deere &#38; Company and Alibaba.  Finally on Friday, the National People's Congress 
will open in China. The central government is expected to unveil more fiscal measures, aimed at supporting 
households and encouraging consumption. Another thing that will be interesting to see is whether a numerical GDP 
target for this year is made, since Bloomberg reported previously that one option that could be done instead is to 
have a description of the GDP goal.  Below, courtesy of Deutsche Bank, is a day-by-day calendar of events:

May 18, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; Ryanair expects to 
be flying 50% of its usual capacity by late summer 2020, a more bullish forecast than most predict.CEO Michael 
O'Leary says holidaymakers will fuel the return, as they seek sunny beaches of Spain and Portugal.He also blasted 
mandatory quarantine periods as "idiotic" in a CNBC interview Monday.[1]Visit Business Insider's homepage for 
more stories[2]. Ryanair remains surprisingly optimistic in the face of thousands of layoffs and the number of its 
scheduled flights being reduced to a tiny percentage of the usual.Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the Irish 
budget carrier, told CNBC Monday that he still expects many families to still take summer holidays to warmer 
European locations with beaches, like Spain and Portugal. That should help traffic tick up from the 1% of usual 
service Ryanair ran in May."At best we think we're talking about 50% of our normal traffic in the months of July, 
August, September," he said. 
"And then maybe a return to some degree of normality as the schools go back."O'Leary, who's garnered a 
reputation in recent months for lively interviews[3]regarding the coronavirus' dramatic effect on global air travel, also 
blasted government quarantine policies for overseas travelers entering the United Kingdom."What's likely is, as 
extensions ease or lose credibility, such as the 14-day lockdown, I think you will see people return in quite quick 
numbers," he said, noting that government ministers seem to be "making this stuff up as they go along."Italy, he 
said, has taken the right approach."They removed this idiotic 14-day isolation that is both unimplementable and 
unmanageable, in favorof using masks and temperature checks," he said.More effective, he said, are face-masks, 
which both passengers and crew will be required to wear."The reality is face masks, as demonstrated in Asia, if 
both a covid sufferer and and a non-covid sufferer are both wearing face masks you reduce the risk of transmission 
by 98%," he said."It will be a different experience," O'Leary said. "But I think confidence will restore pretty quickly. 
Then I think numbers will be stimulated by very low cost air fares." Loading Something is loading.    Do you have a

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/governments-quarantine-plan-is-idiotic-says-ryanair-boss/The 
government's 
plan to quarantine arrivals in the UK is 'idiotic' and will be ignored by the travelling public, according to the boss of 
Ryanair.Michael O'Leary said that the proposals, due to be implemented by the start of June, were likely to be 
shunned by many people because they were 'hopelessly defective', doing little to control the spread of coronavirus. 
He called instead for the compulsory use of facemasks on all flights, as well as on trains and the London 
Underground, claiming that this would be a more effective measure to manage the infection. 
He spoke out as Ryanair posted its annual results, with the airline warning that it expected overall passenger 
numbers to almost halve in the current financial year. The budget carrier reported a 13 per cent increase in profits 
to €1 billion (890 million) for the year ending in March on revenue up 10 per cent to €8.4 billion (7.6 billion). 
However, it said that it expected to deliver significant losses in the current quarter because of the impact of 
coronavirus. Mr O'Leary warned that the impact could be exacerbated by the government's plan to require all 
arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days[1], regardless of their mode of travel. Ministers are expected to abandon efforts 
today to exempt travellers from France, although hauliers, scientists, medics and border officials will not have to 
comply. The plan has infuriated airlines and tour operators, who warn that it will undermine any attempt to resurrect 
their industries following the lockdown. Tour operators such as Tui and Jet2 have been planning to restart holidays 
as soon as mid-June but if Britons are required to self-isolate on their return this is likely to prevent any large-scale 
bookings. British Airways has already said that it will not resume major flight operations while the quarantine 
remains in place. Mr O'Leary said today that the policy was 'idiotic and it is un-implementable'. Speaking on BBC 
Radio 4's Today programme, he said: 'You don't have enough police in the UK to implement a two-week lockdown. 
And what's really worrying is that a two-week lockdown has no medical or scientific basis to it in any event. If you 
really want to do something that's effective, wear masks.' Ryanair has announced plans to implement 40 per cent of 
flights — 1,000 a day — from the start of July as part of its own recovery. It has said that facemasks will be 
compulsory on flights and at airports. The airline has also told passengers that it may take their temperature before 
they fly and refuse to allow those with a fever on board. Mr O'Leary said that it was likely that the quarantine plan 
would be dropped within weeks because people would refuse to abide by it. 'The 14-day lockdown has no 
credibility[2] and I think will be eliminated by the time we get to the end of June anyway,' he said. 'As the 
government puts more meat on the bones of an un-implementable, unmanageable and un-policeable 14-day 
Government's quarantine plan is idiotic, says Ryanair boss
lockdown, people will simple ignore something that is so hopelessly defective in favour of . . . some effective 
measures like facemasks. Facemasks are effective; 14-day isolations aren't. ' In its results, the airline said that it 
saw an increase in passengers for the full year but that since the start of April it had operated less than 1 per cent of 
its scheduled flights. It told investors that it had sufficient funds to 'weather Covid-19 and emerge stronger when the 
crisis passes'. Ryanair is in the midst of consultations over base closures, job cuts of up to 3,000 mainly affecting 
pilots and cabin crew, and pay cuts as it looks to keep costs low. Nevertheless the Irish carrier expects to post a 
loss of more than €200 million (178 million) for the quarter to the end of June. It expects a smaller loss in the 
second quarter amid a 'substantial decline in traffic and pricing' as a result of the coronavirus groundings. Ryanair 
said that it expected passenger numbers for the current year to be 'less than 80 million', reducing its target of 100 
million given last week. Its original target had been 154 million. In a statement, Ryanair said: 'Full year 2021 will be 
difficult for the Ryanair Group as its airlines work hard to return to scheduled flying following the covid-19 crisis. As 
we look beyond the next year, there will be significant opportunities for Ryanair's low cost, growth model as 
competitors shrink, fail or are acquired by government bailed out carriers.' Read more: Government's quarantine

May 18, 2020( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Like 
other airlines, the COVID-19 crisis is going to cost Ryanair a fortune as its latest results show. Yet even though it 
won't be tapping state funds like its rivals, it is still well-placed to come through the storm."Lufthansa is going 
around hoovering up state aid like the drunken uncle at the end of a wedding, drinking from all the empty glasses. 
They can't help themselves."Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary rarely attempts to hide his contempt for national flag 
carriers like Lufthansa, as the above quote, which he gave to Bloomberg, attests to.He went even further when he 
spoke to Sky News in the UK, comparing the airline to a "crack cocaine junkie" due to the fact that it has asked the 
German government to provide a €10 billion ($10.8 billion) rescue package on top of the short-time work provisions 
it was already availing of.Ryanair and its loquacious CEO has stepped up criticism of flag carriers such as 
Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, Alitalia and others since the COVID-19 crisis prompted a raft of state interventions into 
the airline sector.At the release of its financial results on Monday, the Dublin-based airline insisted it would not be 
seeking any government support as it tries to make it through the crisis, which has caused serious financial 
problems for the aviation sector as lockdown restrictions have dramatically impacted international travel.A bad 
quarter aheadRyanair has been one of the big success stories in global aviation in the last 20 years yet even 
though it appears capable of weathering the crisis on its own, the results it presented on Monday illustrate how 
serious a threat the COVID-19 crisis is for the sector.It expects a €200 million loss for its fiscal first quarter (April-
June), the period in which restrictions are most stringent and in which it expects to operate less than 1 per cent of 
its scheduled flying programme.Ryanair did not provide any profit guidance for the 2020-21 fiscal year but it did say 
it expects to carry almost 50% less passengers by March 2021 than it would have otherwise, down to 80 million 
from its original goal of 154 million.Earlier in May, Ryanair announced its plan to resume operating up to 40% of its 
normal flight schedule from July 1, an ambitious goal given the extent to which travel restrictions are still likely to be 
in place across Europe by then, as well as complications over hygiene and social distancing.Several have 
questioned the viability of Ryanair's plan but O'Leary and the airline have been equally strident in their views 
regarding proposals around 14-day quarantining and the prospect of middle seats being taken out of airplanes in 
order to facilitate social distancing.O'Leary described UK government plans around 14-day quarantining after flying 
as "idiotic", and used the same word to describe the proposed removal of seats from aircrafts.The state of aidAs 
part of its own plan to cope, Ryanair plans to cut around 3,000 jobs. 
It has also instituted plans for wholesale unpaid leave and for significant paycuts, including a 50% paycut for 
O'Leary itself.While O'Leary has never shied from speaking in an uncomplimentary way about the likes of 
Lufthansa, as often for publicity purposes as anything else, the issue of state aid at the moment genuinely rankles 
Ryanair struggles on without state aid, but still well placed to fly high again
with him.Ryanair has a long running rivalry with Lufthansa. By most metrics, the two airline groups are comfortably 
the largest in Europe but O'Leary's view is that Lufthansa is artificially propped up by state support in a way that 
unfairly protects it.While no deal has been done yet between the German government, Lufthansa is likely to receive 
a substantial aid package of some kind in the coming weeks. It is also negotiating with the Belgian and Austrian 
governments for similar supports, where two airlines it owns, Brussels Airlines and Austrian Airlines, are 
based.Several other big European carriers have already tapped funds unavailable to the likes of Ryanair. France 
has already agreed to funnel €7 billion in cheap loans to Air France while the Dutch government will provide 
between €2 billion and €4 billion to KLM, which is joined with Air France since a 2004 merger, of which the French 
and Dutch governments each hold 14% stakes.Crisis equals opportunity?Quite what the European aviation sector 
will look like once the crisis has passed is hard to envisage. O'Leary has suggested that large airlines propped up 
with state aid will simply use the crisis to drown out competition in a post-COVID world.But Ryanair has proven 
adept in profiting from a crisis itself in the past.After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the airline sector faced a 
similar level of crisis as today. O'Leary responded with massive seat sales, which proved successful. His current 
instinct is similar to the one he had back then - that passengers will be eager to fly as soon as they are allowed to, 
as long as the price is right.Few European airlines came into the crisis as well-insulated as the Irish low-cost carrier. 
In its results on Monday, it posted a €1bn post-tax profit for the year to March 2020. Despite the fact that 
groundings were already in place by March, that figure is 13% higher than the previous year, an illustration of just 
how profitable Ryanair is in "normal" times. And things were hardly normal in 2019 either, what with Boeing's 
problems.That has helped it build cash reserves of €4 billion, a handy tool with which to deal with the mammoth 
cost of having to keep 450 airplanes on the ground.While such a situation can't go on forever, if Ryanair manages 
its current plan of having up to 50% of its original target back in the air for the July-September quarter, it will already 
be well on the way to emerging from the clouds of a crisis that many other airlines may never slip out from under.

May 15, 2020( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  This week's featured 
linkCOVID-19 Outlook for air travel in the next 5 years[1] - IATA This presentation has all kinds of interesting tidbits 
around how IATA came to the conclusion that the industry will go back to normal in 3 to 5 years, lagging the rest of 
the economy. In particular, the comparison between Chinese business confidence and air traffic is concerning. 
https://crankyconcierge.com/collections/airports/products/sydney-syd-t-shirtImage of the Week: Nothing really 
grabbed me this week, so I decided I'd put up a t-shirt reminder. The Airport Collection[2] continues to grow, and 
I've added everything from Anchorage[3] and Nashville[4] to Tampa[5] and, as you can see above, Sydney[6]. More 
are on the way every day. Note that there are several colors available and not just the gray I showed on 
Wednesday.  Two for the roadAnalysis: Mitsubishi suspends development of M100, continues M90 due to 
COVID[7] - Leeham News and Analysis Well, Embraer could use a little good news, and this is it. If Mitsubishi ends 
up shelving the M100, that means Embraer has the only 76-seater flying that regionals can fly for US partners. 
Strategically, this seems like a big miss for Mitsubishi, but on the other hand, this does require big money. And then 
again, who knows what pilot scope clauses will look like down the road.Ryanair to axe Lauda's Airbus leases in 
favour of Boeing[8] - ch-aviation Ryanair was pretty excited about bringing Airbuses into the fleet with its acquisition 
of Lauda, but now the airline appears to have soured on the idea and will scale back plans dramatically. I just 
assume that everything Ryanair does is a negotiation of some sort, so if Airbus wants to come play ball, Ryanair 
won't turn them away. But this sounds like Airbus isn't particularly interested at least not enough to price the 
airplanes where Ryanair wants them. [ 1]:            https://www.iata.org/en/iata-repository/publications/economic-

reported bland traffic numbers for April, 2020 primarily due to lacklustre air travel demand stemming from the 
COVID-19 outbreak. Both domestic as well as international demand and supply fell on a year-over-year and year-
till-date basis. Moreover, consolidated load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined since consolidated 
traffic plunge was more than the capacity reduction.Consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger kilometers 
or RPKs) fell 90% year over year. Apart from a significant decline of 92.6% in international traffic, the metric also 
plunged 89.3% on the domestic front, thereby buoying the overall figure. Consolidated capacity (measured in 
available seat kilometers/ASKs) dropped 87.7% due to 87.2% and 89.9% fall in domestic and international capacity, 
respectively.Consolidated load factor fell to 68.8% (or 15.6 percentage points). Both domestic load factor declined 
13.9 percentage points to 69.8 and international load factor declined 22.9 percentage points to 64%.AZUL SA Price

May 14, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair released five-step safety 
guidelines on how it will operate amid the Coronavirus pandemic, as the airline is preparing to resume 40% of its 
scheduled flights as of July 1. 'Ryanair will work closely with public health authorities to ensure that these flights 
comply, where possible, with effective measures to limit the spread of Covid-19', saidRyanair's CEO Eddie Wilson 
in an announcement issued on May 12. Europe's largest low-cost airline published safety guidelines for five stages; 
before flying, while at the airport, when boarding, on board, and when landing.  According to the announcement, 
Ryanair advises passengers to opt for carrying their cabin bags with them, check their temperature at home, and 
wear a mask at all times. 
At the airport, travellers should use the automated kiosk to check their bag and the fast track if possible, as well as 
to keep social-distance and use hand sanitiser if not wash their hands. While boarding, passengers should not 
queue at gates but have their passport open and ready to scan. The airline's crew will be wearing masks at all 
times, and the aircrafts, that usefiltration systems with hospital standards, will beprofessionally cleaned and 
disinfected on a daily basis. Inflight service will be limited and sales will be cashless. Upon arrival, passengers 
should maintain their mask and keep social-distance. The company's CEO said that as the example of Asia has 
shown, 'temperature checks and face masks/coverings are the most effective way to achieve this on short haul (1 
hour) within Europe's single market.' Ryanair will also require passengers flying in July and August to fill in details of 
how long their planned visit will be, and also their address while visiting another EU country, the company's 
announcement reads. This contact information will be provided to EU Governments to help them monitor any 
isolation regulations they require of visitors on intra-EU flights, the statement adds. Earlier in May, Ryanair 
announced plans to cut up to 3,000 jobs, mostly pilots and cabin crew, and a 20% pay cut to the remaining staff, in 
a bid to survive the Coronavirus crisis.

Wednesday 1st July 2020, subject to Government restrictions on intra-EU flights being lifted, and effective public 
health measures being put in place at airports. Ryanair will operate a daily flight schedule of almost 1,000 flights, 
restoring 90% of its pre-COVID 19 route network. Full details of these routes, frequencies, flight times, and 
promotional prices are available on            www.Ryanair.com. Since the COVID 19 flight restrictions in mid-March, 
Ryanair has been operating a skeleton daily schedule of 30 flights between Ireland, the UK and Europe. 
From July, Ryanair will restart flying from most of its 80 bases across Europe. There will be fewer daily/weekly 
frequencies on trunk routes, as Ryanair works to restore some services on the widest number of routes, rather than 
operating high frequency services on a small number. Ryanair also released a return to flying video, encouraging 
passengers to observe effective health measures. These include fewer checked bags, check in online, downloading 
boarding pass to passenger smart phones, as well as undergoing temperature checks at airport entry and wearing 
face masks/coverings at all times in the terminal and on board aircraft. On board its aircraft, Ryanair cabin crew will 
wear face masks/coverings and a limited inflight service will be offered of pre-packaged snacks and drinks, with no 
cash sales. Queuing for toilets will also be prohibited on board although toilet access will be made available to 
individual passengers upon request. Ryanair will require all passengers flying in July and August to fill in details at 
the point of check in of how long their planned visit will be, and also their address while visiting another EU country. 
This contact information will be provided to EU Governments to help them to monitor any isolation regulations they 
require of visitors on intra-EU flights. Speaking to Sky News, CEO Michael O'Leary said: 'We think those flights will

be between 50-60% booked, lower than our normal load'. He called the British government's two-week isolation for 
those flying into the UK as 'ineffective', 'unenforceable and unpolicable', saying that it had 'no science base to it at 
all'.

May 12, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair announced it is planning 
to restart 40% of its planned network for the main summer months. The airline has grounded most of its flights[1] 
amid the coronavirus crisis. Currently, Ryanair is having about 30 flights a day, concentrated on connecting Ireland 
and the United Kingdom, but it said flights would be ramped up from late June. 'After four months, it is time to get 
Europe flying again so we can reunite friends and families, allow people to return to work, and restart Europe's 
tourism industry, which provides so many millions of jobs', the company's chief executive, Eddie Wilson, said. 'With 
more than six weeks to go to 1st July, Ryanair believes this is the most practical date to resume normal flight 
schedules, so that we can allow friends and families to reunite, commuters to go back to work, and allow those 
tourism based economies such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, France and others, to recover what is left of this 
year's tourism season', he added. According to the new safety rules, passengers will have to wear face coverings 
while passing through the airport and on the aircraft. Cabin crew, wearing face masks, will make inflight sales only 
with contactless payments, and passengers will not be permitted to line up for the toilet. [ 1]:

passengers and their families to deal with emergencies that may require urgent travel over the coming days and 
weeks. All the aircraft are disinfected daily, and we ask all passengers to cooperate fully with our crews who are 
doing their best in difficult times,' she added. As most EU countries have imposed flight bans or other restrictions, 
over 99% of Ryanair's aircraft are grounded for the coming weeks. The company operates only several routes from 
the UK and Ireland to other destinations in Europe. 'At this time, we expect scheduled flights to return sometime in 
July,' the Ryanair representative said.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-plans-to-introduce-1000-flights-a-day-by-july/Ryanair is planning to 
reintroduce 1,000 flights a day by July 1, with passengers undergoing temperature checks at airports to combat the 
spread of coronavirus.Europe's busiest airline said today that 40 per cent of its flight schedule would be restored 
within seven weeks, subject to government restrictions on travel across the Continent being lifted. The budget 
carrier, which operates from almost 20 UK airports, said that it would restart flying from 'most' of its bases across 
Europe in the biggest expansion of travel since the lockdown was introduced. 
The move comes despite the planned introduction of a two-week quarantine period for most passengers entering 
the UK, possibly from June 1. Other airlines have said that the measures will decimate the industry and prevent the 
vast majority of people from flying. Ryanair insisted that it would put extensive safety measures in place to limit any 
spread of coronavirus. Passengers will be asked to take their own temperature before leaving home and it could be 
rechecked at the airport by airline staff. Travellers with a high temperature — typically those above 38C — 'will be 
asked to return home', Ryanair said. All passengers will have to wear face coverings throughout the airport and 
plane cabin. Queueing for lavatories on board aircraft will also be banned, with customers instead forced to request 
to use the loo. The Irish airline insisted that social distancing on aircraft 'will be encouraged where it is possible' 
although it did not reveal how many seats will be taken up. Other airlines have faced criticism for failing to maintain 
empty seats between passengers to enforce social distancing. Some experts have said that airlines would only be 
able to carry as little as 20 per cent of usual passenger numbers to maintain the full recommended two metres 
between travellers. The airline, which plans to operate at least some flights on 90 per cent of its usual flight network, 
said that on-board refreshments will be limited to pre-packaged items, sales will be cashless and cabins will be 
disinfected every night. Ryanair indicated that it would co-operate with any quarantine measures imposed by EU 
states and the UK. The UK will require passengers arriving from any country — other than France and Ireland — to 
self-isolate for a two-week period, under measures announced this week. The airline said that all passengers flying 
in July and August will be asked to fill in details at check-in of how long their planned visit will be, their address 
while visiting another EU country and contact information. This will 'help them to monitor any isolation regulations 
they require of visitors'. The move represents the biggest boost to flight schedules since the lockdown was imposed 
in late March. At least 98 per cent of flights in and out of the UK have been grounded in recent weeks, with the boss 
of British Airways' parent company warning yesterday that it represented the 'biggest crisis' in the airline's history. 
Ryanair plans to introduce 1,000 flights a day by July
Earlier this month Wizz Air, the eastern European budget carrier, restored seven flights out of Luton airport and 
other carriers such as Lufthansa and KLM have also announced plans to extend schedules. Ryanair has been 
operating a skeleton daily schedule of 30 flights between Ireland, the UK and Europe over the last seven weeks. 
Eddie Wilson, the carrier's chief executive, said: 'It is important for our customers and our people that we return to 
some normal schedules from 1 July onwards. After four months, it is time to get Europe flying again so we can 
reunite friends and families, allow people to return to work and restart Europe's tourism industry, which provides so 
many millions of jobs. 'Ryanair will work closely with public health authorities to ensure that these flights comply, 
where possible, with effective measures to limit the spread of Covid-19. As already shown in Asia, temperature 
checks and face masks or coverings are the most effective way to achieve this on short-haul within Europe's single 
market. 'Now that Europe's states are allowing some gradual return to normal life, we expect this will evolve over 
the coming weeks and months.' Read more: Ryanair plans to introduce 1,000 flights a day by July[1] [ 1]:

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/heathrow-to-begin-temperature-screening-trial-in-bid-to-reduce-coronavirus-
risk/Heathrow is to trial temperature screening passengers, a move aimed at reducing the risk of passengers 
contracting or transmitting Covid-19 while travelling.The measure was deployed by many other major airports 
around the world several weeks ago and Heathrow has been criticised for not introducing screening earlier. Chief 
executive John Holland-Kaye said it will trial technologies and processes which could form the basis of a common 
international standard for health screening at airports in a bid to encourage passengers to return to flying. 
The first trial will be launched in the next two weeks and will involve using cameras which are capable of monitoring 
the temperatures of people. Cameras will initially be used in the airport's immigration halls, but could be deployed in 
areas for departures, connections and airport staff searches. The airline industry has been decimated by the 
coronavirus pandemic as travel ground to a half with many around the world struggling to survive as passenger 
number tumble. On Tuesday, Virgin Atlantic announced it was laying off a third of its workforce, offloading 737s and 
pulling out of Gatwick Airport[1] amid the ongoing crisis. The news came a week after British Airways said it was set 
to make up to 12,000 workers redundant[2]. The airline also indicated it may pull out of Gatwick, the UK's second 
busiest airport, even after borders reopen. A peak times of the year BA operates 180 flights a day, accounting for 
one in five flights. Budget airline Ryanair said it expects to cut 3,000 jobs[3], including pilots and cabin crew, from its 
workforce. The airline said its flights will remain grounded until 'at least July' and passenger numbers will not return 
to 2019 levels 'until summer 2022 at the earliest'. Mr Holland-Kaye said: 'Aviation is the cornerstone of the UK 
economy, and to restart the economy the Government needs to help restart aviation. 'The UK has the world's third-
largest aviation sector, offering the platform for the Government to take a lead in agreeing a common international 
standard for aviation health with our main trading partners. 'This standard is key to minimising transmission of 
Covid-19 across borders, and the technology we are trialling at Heathrow could be part of the solution.' Heathrow is 
also considering the use of UV light to quickly sanitise security trays, and contact-free security screening 
equipment. The airport pledged to share data from its trials with the Government and the rest of the aviation 
industry to help develop the common standard it is seeking.Photo: Library Photo of Singapore airport carrying out

View original post here[2]. The future of economy class cabins on commercial jets could be reshaped because of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. New cabin seating arrangements have already been conceptualized by an Italian design 
firm this week that shows plastic shields and backward seats. 
 Aviointeriors has designed a "hygienic screen to cocoon passengers and keep them separate from their neighbors. 
Let's take a look at Glassafe, a potential post-COVID-19 economy cabin modification," reported Simple Flying[3].    
Glassafe is a kit-level solution for airlines that can be installed on existing seats to make close passenger seating a 
reality while abiding by social distancing rules.    The company has also rolled out another concept. It is called 
Janus, a row of three seats where every middle seat is positioned backwards.    As shown in this view, Janus has a 
"wrap-around transparent barrier envelopes each passenger, providing a big plastic cocoon that protects from 
germs, bad breath, and fights for the armrest," said Simple Flying.    The biggest challenge at the moment for major 
airlines is to make customers feel safe in a closed environment. And perhaps by restructuring the cabin with social 
distancing in mind, plastic shields and backwards seats could be the solution.  We noted on Friday morning[4] that 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary was unhappy with "idiotic" in-flight social distancing rules. He said Irish authorities 
forced his planes to eliminate the middle seat to comply with new regulations.  Perhaps O'Leary should give 
Aviointeriors 
a 
call 
about 
the

arrangement

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/virgin-atlantic-to-axe-3000-jobs-in-battle-for-survival/Virgin 
Atlantic 
has 
announced that it is to axe up to a third of its workforce as it battles to secure new funding that would enable it to 
survive the coronavirus pandemic.The airline majority-owned by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group has announced 
that it is cutting 3,150 jobs in a move that will spell the end of its long-running operations at London's Gatwick 
Airport. Trade unions and staff were being briefed on the redundancies on Tuesday lunchtime, with an external 
announcement expected imminently, according to one official. 
The restructuring of Virgin Atlantic's workforce will follow a week of brutal job losses across Britain's aviation 
industry. British Airways has begun consulting on up to 12,000 redundancies[1], while Ryanair has said it plans to 
axe 3,000 jobs. As we reported on Friday, Rolls Royce Holdings, the aircraft engine manufacturer, would reduce its 
UK workforce by about 8,000[2] people amid expectations of a protracted slump in demand because of the COVID-
19 crisis. Virgin Atlantic's restructuring is likely to be pitched by the airline's management as an important step 
towards securing hundreds of millions of pounds of new funding from private investors or the government, 
according to one union source. The company has argued that it provides essential competition to BA, and is likely 
to hold out an olive branch to staff that an eventual recovery in the airline industry's fortunes could pave the way for 
future expansion. One source said that Virgin Atlantic's announcement would include the disclosure that it was 
refocusing its operations on Heathrow and Manchester airports. That would represent a major blow to Gatwick, 
which was notified last week that BA might never resume flying from London's second-busiest airport. Virgin 
Atlantic is anticipating that customer demand will be at least 40% lower during 2020, with only a gradual recovery 
next year. The Treasury has, to date, been lukewarm about the idea of committing taxpayers' money to Virgin 
Atlantic, partly because of its ownership by billionaire Sir Richard and Delta Air Lines, a US carrier which has itself 
just been bailed out by Washington. Sir Richard made an impassioned defence of his group's financial affairs last 
month, warning that the transatlantic airline he founded in the 1980s was likely to collapse without government 
support. He has already seen Virgin Australia fall into a process called voluntary administration[3], putting 
thousands of jobs at risk. Sir Richard has been seeking hundreds of millions of pounds in the form of a commercial 
loan, as well as a government guarantee on further sums owed to it by credit card companies. Talks with private 
investors also include other forms of financing that could dilute the tycoon's 51% stake. In April, Sky News revealed 
that Heathrow Airport and some of the aviation industry's biggest manufacturers were mounting a frantic lobbying 
Virgin Atlantic axes 3,000 jobs and leaves Gatwick in battle for survival
campaign to secure taxpayer support for Virgin Atlantic. In one of the letters, John Harrison, general counsel and 
UK chairman of Airbus, warned that Virgin Atlantic's 'collapse could have an extremely negative impact on the A330 
[aircraft manufacturing] programme'. 'As you will be aware, all wings for these aircraft are designed and 
manufactured in the UK, and orders from airlines like Virgin are vital for the continuation of our business,' Mr 
Harrison wrote. The pleas from industry stakeholders underlined the extent to which Virgin Atlantic regards the 
coronavirus pandemic as an existential threat. The company, which recently received a capital injection amounting 
to more than $100m from Virgin Group, has furloughed thousands of staff and seen its top executives agree 
substantial pay cuts because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Fewer than a handful of Virgin Atlantic's planes have been 
flying since the UK lockdown began in March, when Peter Norris, Virgin Group's chairman, urged Boris Johnson to 
establish an industry-wide support package that could cost in the region of 7.5bn. Hopes in the airline industry that 
such a rescue plan might be forthcoming appeared to be dashed, however, when Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, 
indicated that state aid would be available 'only as a last resort' and after the support of existing government 
schemes and companies' existing shareholders had been pursued. He added that help would only be afforded to 
companies which had demonstrated their value to the wider UK economy and to competition in the aviation sector. 
Despite his long-stated antipathy to government rescues of airlines, Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA's parent, 
International Airlines Group, sanctioned a €1bn state-backed loan for its Spanish airlines. Virgin Atlantic declined to 
comment, although it recently denied reports that its discussions with government had faltered, saying they were 
'ongoing' and that the company's 'cash position remains stable'. Read more: Virgin Atlantic axes 3,000 jobs and

View original post here[2]. US equity futures, European stock markets and oil prices all fell on Monday as an 
escalating war of words between top U.S. officials and China over the origin of the coronavirus fuelled fears of a 
new trade war, derailing a rebound in global markets, while Buffett's admission he had liquidated all his airline 
stocks sent the sector tumbling.  European shares - which were closed on Friday - slumped 2.5% in mid-morning 
trading, catching up to the Friday drop in the US with sectors sensitive to economic growth including oil and gas, 
automakers and banks falling between about 4% and 5.5%. Volatility gauges for European and American blue-chip 
stocks shot up to a two-week high while U.S. stock futures were about 1% in the red.    Delta Air Lines, American 
Airlines Group and United Airlines Holdings are among the biggest pre-market decliners after Warren Buffett said 
over the weekend Berkshire Hathaway sold out of the four top U.S. airlines, opining that the business has 'changed 
in a very major way.' The JETS airline ETF tumbled -10%.    In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 slumped, with all 
19industry sectorsin the red and Ireland's Ryanair Holdings Plc sinking as much as 11%. Earlier, MSCI's broadest 
index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 2.5%, pulled down by Hong Kong where the Hang Seng returned 
from a two-session holiday with its biggest drop in six weeks as traders caught up after a long weekend. 
China and Japan were closed for their own holidays. The Chinese yuan held most of Friday's slide in offshore 
trading amid concern tensions with the U.S. would increase.  Emerging-market stocks suffered the biggest decline 
in six weeks as an increase intension between the U.S. and China dented demand for riskier assets.  U.S. 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday there was 'a significant amount of evidence' that the novel 
coronavirus emerged from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. An editorial in China's Global Times 
said he was 'bluffing' and called on the United States to present its evidence.  'Concern on the potential for another 
flare up between the U.S. and China is dominating price action,' RBC strategist Adam Cole said in a morning note. 
Simon Black, head of investment management at wealth management firm Dolfin said investors were also adjusting 
their forecasts for the depth of the economic damage the pandemic will inflict. 'It's also the economic reality sinking 
in,' he said, adding that a rebound by global equities of over 20% from lows hit in March was not likely to be 
sustainable.  President Donald Trump also renewed criticism of China for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak is 
raising concern over the future of the two countries' trade deal, another potential risk for emerging markets already 
facing dwindling demand for exports.  "This renews concerns on the trade war and the hegemonic dispute between

the two countries, which we have been expecting to last for many months and to be a structural factor for EMs in 
the long run,' said Guillaume Tresca, a senior strategist at Credit Agricole SA in Paris. 'Attention is now refocusing 
on the economic impact of the Covid crisis and the weak stance of many emerging-market countries.'  Elsewhere, 
companies listed on the pan-European STOXX 600 are currently expected to report a 40% decline in earnings in 
the second quarter. Manufacturing activity in the euro zone collapsed last month as government-imposed 
lockdowns to stop the spread of the new coronavirus forced factories to close and consumers to stay at home, a 
survey showed on Monday.  'We've just come off a rally of hopes, not a rally on fundamentals', Black said, pointing 
to the massive monetary and fiscal stimulus pledged by governments and central banks around the world.  Recent 
economic data paints a dire picture of the global economy after weeks of lockdowns. In the United States, 
manufacturing plunged to an 11-year low last month and consumer spending collapsed. Some 30.3 million 
Americans have filed unemployment claims.  In FX, the US dollar rose against most major currencies amid fears 
that last year's U.S.-China dispute would be reignited, this time over the origins of the pandemic that has stalled 
economies around the world. The euro was down 0.37% at $1.0933 and the pound retreated 0.72% to $1.2407. EM 
currencies weakened, while sovereign bond yields were little changed. The Russian ruble, Indonesian rupiah and 
South Korean won led the currency declines as haven demand bolstered the U.S. dollar. With China's onshore 
markets closed for a holiday, the yuan weakened as much as 0.3% against the dollar in offshore trading, before 
regaining ground.  In commodities, oil prices fell again, paring last week's gains, on worries a global oil glut may 
persist even as lockdowns start to ease. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 5.5% to $18.69 a barrel while 
Brent crude futures were down 2.8% at $25.70. Spot gold was up 0.4% at $1,706.78 per ounce.  Expected data 
include factory orders and durable goods orders. Ferrari, Tyson, and AIG are among companies reporting earnings

lowest since the series began in 1997 — from 44.5 in March  The trade agreement President Donald Trump signed 
with China less than four months ago is falling short on a number of fronts, including Beijing's promises of large 
agriculture and energy purchases. But the Trump administration so far has been hesitant to ramp up the pressure 
or back away from the deal altogether, even as the rhetoric on both sides heats up  Congress turns its attention this 
week to negotiations over another round of economic stimulus, with battle lines drawn over more than $1 trillion in 
additional spending floated by Democrats amid objections from Republicans and demands from President Donald 
Trump  Germany needs several more weeks to decide on a cash-for- clunkers program to counter a slump in car 
sales, according to Finance Minister Olaf Scholz  German's top court will decide on Tuesday whether the nation can 
continue to participate in the ECB's Public Sector Purchase Program, under which the central bank buys bonds of 
euro zone governments  Factory output across several Asian countries slumped to record lows in April, signaling a 
deeper contraction in the world's manufacturing hub even as China begins restarting some operations  Japanese 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he has decided to extend a nationwide state of emergency until May 31 to combat 
the spread of the coronavirus, in comments aired live by national broadcaster NHK  Researchers continue to 
debate how fast a coronavirus vaccine may be available as states and nations look for a fast track to recovery from 
the pandemic's economic toll, with January or even the fall now on the timetable  Asian equity markets began the 
week mostly lower amid several holiday closures in the region and cautiousness ahead of this week's risk events, 
with sentiment also dragged by a flare up at the inter-Korean border and as US-China trade tensions simmered with 
President Trump stating that tariffs would be the ultimate punishment for China and warned to end the trade deal if 
China doesn't buy US goods. ASX 200 (+1.4%) was choppy with notable weakness in energy as crude prices 
resumed the rout brought on by oversupply concerns and with banking names initially pressured after Westpac 
reported a 62% drop in H1 net, although the big 4 bank eventually reversed its losses which helped the turnaround 
in the largest weighted financials sector and the index as a whole. KOSPI (-2.6%) gapped lower by over 2% at the 
open on geopolitical concerns after South Korea and North Korea exchanged gunfire at the demilitarized zone for 
the first time since 2014 which comes a day after North Korea Leader Kim made his first public appearance since

rumours circulated that he may have died or was incapacitated, although the index is off its lows as reports also 
noted there were no casualties from the incident which could have been accidental. Hang Seng (-4.2%) slumped as 
it played catch up from the extended weekend and ahead of today's GDP which could show the largest contraction 
on record with Financial Services Secretary Chan suggesting GDP data could be worse than the GFC and Asian 
Financial Crisis which saw economic contractions of 7.8% and 8.3% respectively. The lack of participants added to 
the uninspired mood for Hong Kong and the region, with markets in mainland China to reopen on Wednesday due 
to Labor Day holidays and with Japanese participants returning on Thursday after Golden Week. Finally, Indian 
markets were the worst performers with the NIFTY and SENSEX both collapsing by as much as 5% after the 
government extended the nationwide lockdown for two weeks but will permit "considerable relaxations" in certain 
districts.  Top Asian News  Mainland Chinese Buyers Disappear From Hong Kong Real Estate  Japan Moves to

European equities opened with significant losses [Euro Stoxx 50 -3.3%], as the region catches up to Friday's 
developments, namely on the US-China trade front, after its Labor Day holiday. US equity futures also post losses 
of ~1%, with the contracts pressured by a potential rollback in the US-China Phase One trade deal should China 
not adhere to purchases. UK's FTSE 100 (-0.2%) index outperforms the region having had its Friday session whilst 
some downside could be cushioned by a softer Sterling. Sectors are lower across the board - with IT and Consumer 
Discretionary the laggards, albeit most of this overall downside would be on account of a chunk of Europe catching 
up to Friday's trade. In terms of individual movers, BT (-1.4%) opened softer (but nursed some losses) amid reports 
Telefonica (+3.4%) is said to be in discussions with Liberty Global to combine their UK assets, O2 and Virgin 
Media, in a joint venture to challenge BT and Sky in the UK - Telefonica states that the Cos are in a negotiating 
phase and the group is currently not able to guarantee either the terms or probability of its success. Sources added 
that Liberty Global also reportedly approached Vodafone (-1.1%) regarding a merger, but talks are not currently 
active. Meanwhile, Fincantieri (+15.8%) was halted limit up after receiving a US Navy contract valued at USD 
5.5bln. SocGen (-6.2%) shares see extra pressure as it expects to have provisions of EUR 3.5-5bln this year amid 
losses caused by the pandemic. CEO also sees CET1 ratio to drop to between 11-15%. Similarly, Thyssenkrupp (-
14.5%) plumbs the depths as the Co. anticipates a cash-squeeze despite the lift unit sale. Elsewhere, Roche 
(+0.3%) remains resilient to the losses in the region after the group was awarded emergency approval in the US for 
a COVID-19 antibody test and expects production to hit high double-digit millions by June and 100mln later in the 
year. Finally, Royal Mail (+6.2%) is buoyed by reports that Czech billionaire Kretinsky reportedly bought a 5.35% 
stake in the Co., sparking speculation he could launch a takeover bid.  Top European News  ThyssenKrupp Sinks

in Five Weeks  In FX, the Greenback is back on a firmer footing after succumbing to somewhat more than the usual 
month end selling and remaining under pressure on Friday when US President Trump upped the ante against 
China via recriminations over the source of COVID-19 and the threat of retaliation. However, risk aversion has 
spread to the extent that the Buck has resumed a degree of safe-haven premium vs currency counterparts bar the 
Yen, with the DXY retaining a firmer grasp of the 99.000 handle within a 99.239-477 range.  JPY - As noted above, 
the Yen is resisting the broad trend of underperformance relative to the recovering Dollar, albeit in holiday-thinned 
trade due to Japan's Greenery Day amidst the longer Golden Week vacation, as Usd/Jpy meanders in a tight band 
below 107.00.  GBP/EUR/CHF/NZD/CAD/AUD - Sterling has lost more of its seasonal bid, as the sell in May trend 
looks set to continue for a second day with Cable teetering above 1.2400 and Eur/Gbp testing 
resistance/psychological offers around 0.8800 ahead of the 50 DMA (0.8825) even though the Euro is struggling to 
keep hold of the 1.0900 handle vs the Greenback in wake of weak Eurozone manufacturing PMIs, ECB SPF 
downgrades and a worse than forecast Sentix survey. Technically, Eur/Usd is currently close to a Fib retracement 
at 1.0938 and supported ahead of the big figure that also coincides with the 30 DMA. Elsewhere, the Franc remains 
well shy of recent highs near 0.9600 circa 0.9650, but on the rebound in Eur/Chf cross terms around 1.0550 
following mixed Swiss inputs from yet another big rise in bank sight deposits and better than expected, albeit still 
sub-50 manufacturing PMI. Meanwhile, the Kiwi, Aussie and Loonie are all nursing losses after conceding ground to 
their US rival with Nzd/Usd hovering just under 0.6050, Aud/Usd straddling 0.6400 and Usd/Cad pivoting 1.4100 
amidst renewed declines in oil prices. The Kiwi has not gleaned much from S&#38;P reaffirming NZ's AA rating and 
positive outlook or more moves towards lifting lockdown, awaiting Q1 jobs data, while the Aussie appears hesitant 
ahead of the RBA, retail sales and the SOMP.  SCANDI/EM - The aforementioned downturn in crude is weighing on 
the Norwegian Crown alongside the ongoing PMI manufacturing contraction, though not as pronounced as in 
Global Stocks Tumble On Renewed US -China Tensions; US Airlines Plunge On Buffett Exit
Sweden where the Krona is also unwinding more post-Riksbank gains. However, the Rand has derived some 
comfort from SA's PMI beating consensus and deflecting attention away from bleak economic projections out of the 
Treasury Director, while the Lira is trying to pare losses off another multi-month low on the back of firmer than 
anticipated Turkish CPI in contrast to a deeper sub-50 manufacturing PMI.  In commodities, WTI and Brent front-
month futures remain subdued but trade just off recent lows of USD 18.05/bbl and USD 25.50/bbl respectively. 
Desks note that the sentiment surrounding the complex is showing signs of improvement, with economies gradually 
reopening alongside a phase of lower global supply. 'A combination of demand edging higher as we move through 
the remainder of the year, while supply is expected to slip, will likely push the global oil market into deficit over the 
second half of this year, allowing it to draw down the significant stock builds from the first half of this year.', ING 
writes. That being said, markets have begun to factor in a potential escalation in US-China tensions - with President 
Trump floating an end to the trade pact should China not purchase US goods - which could weigh on sentiment as 
well as hit demand. WTI June lost further ground after hovering around USD 18.50/bbl and briefly breached support 
at USD 18.10/bbl, Brent July trades on either side of USD 26/bbl for a large part of the morning and holds onto 
losses of over 2%. Elsewhere, spot gold sees an underlying bid as losses across equities prompts inflows into the 
yellow metal - trading towards the top of its current USD 1693-1707/oz band. Copper prices meanwhile resumed its 
decline amid the broader risk-aversion and some producers are poised to resume operations.  US Event Calendar

overnight wrap  So far in this lockdown I've only been out for local walks. However, on Friday afternoon I had to 
cycle to the post office to send something special delivery. While I queued outside I saw my first-ever social 
distancing fight. A van overtook two cyclists and then screeched to a halt in front of them and the two parties 
exchanged very loud and angry words about an earlier commotion. After a minute, the van driver got out and went 
up to one of the cyclists and for all the world it looked like he was going to hit him. However, he suddenly stopped 
about 2 meters away as if there was a force field there (May the fourth be with you today by the way) and continued 
shouting and gesturing at him. It was very odd to watch.  As we move very slowly towards the end of the most 
stringent lockdowns across the world markets are starting the week on the back foot after US tech gave up some 
ground at the back end of last week after earnings and also as tensions in the US/China relationship resurfaced as 
the blame game for covid-19 steps up. Given it's a US election year this issue isn't likely to go away, especially as 
Joe Biden has suggested that Mr Trump is weak on China. However, on Thursday night and Friday it became a 
more immediate topic as the Washington Post reported that the US had held preliminary discussions to punish 
China for its role in the virus outbreak that included the possibility of the US cancelling its debt obligations with 
China. There was an immediate denial from Larry Kudlow who confirmed that the full faith and credit of US debt 
obligations is 'sacrosanct'. Nevertheless, the risk of a cold war between the two nations seems to be building.  
Hinting at a more troubled world order in the future, yesterday US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said on ABC 
TV that there was 'enormous evidence' to suggest covid-19 began in a laboratory in Wuhan. When you think how 
nervous markets got about the US/China trade war then if this theme continues you can't help thinking that the end 
game is far worse than it would be from a simple trade war. Very much one to watch.  Speaking overnight, 
President Trump also said tariffs would be 'the ultimate punishment' and promised a 'conclusive' report from the US 
government on the Chinese origins of the pandemic. He further said that the Phase 1 trade deal with China requires 
the country to purchase US goods and if they don't, the US will terminate the agreement. Futures on the S&#38;P 
500 are down -0.61% as we type while the Hang Seng (-3.83%), Kospi (-1.61%), Taiwan's Taiex (-2.20%) and 
India's Nifty (-3.31%) are all in the red. Markets in Japan and China are closed for a holiday. In FX, the Norwegian 
krone is trading down -1.17% this morning while the Japanese yen is up +0.13%. Elsewhere, WTI oil prices are 
down -3.29% this morning.  In other weekend news, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul index dropped -7.41% yesterday after 
the kingdom's finance minister said that 'painful' measures - including deep spending cuts - were needed to 
respond to the coronavirus crisis and crash in oil prices. On Friday, Moody's changed the outlook on the country's 
sovereign rating to negative while reaffirming the A1 rating. Elsewhere, Yohnap reported that North Korean troops 
fired at their South Korean counterparts in the demilitarized zone that divides the two countries for the first time in 
years.  Meanwhile, expect there to be some attention in markets today on Warren Buffett's annual shareholder 
meeting on Saturday where he confirmed that he'd sold all of his airline stocks, saying 'I don't know if two or three 
years from now if as many people will fly as many passenger miles as they did last year'.  Returning to the virus, 
with the extra fatalities of the last few days, Covid-19 has now moved from 24th to 23rd in the worst pandemics in 
Global Stocks Tumble On Renewed US -China Tensions; US Airlines Plunge On Buffett Exit
history measured in fatalities as a percentage of the global population (24 in total over 2000 years). Swine Flu in 
2009 has now been surpassed. You can see the note here from a couple of weeks ago where we discussed the list. 
To reach 22 on this list fatalities would have to reach 626,100. Massive global mitigation is expected to keep Covid-
19 at the lower end of our table. As we showed in the note a completely unmitigated global strategy could have put 
it as high as 13th on the list. We also showed what we think the global mortality rate will end up being based on 
various studies and discussed how the modern world has a very different tolerance for pandemics than at any time 
prior to the last few decades.  In terms of this week, the main symbolic highlight will be Friday's US job numbers. 
We'll also see PMIs in the early part of this week, 263 S&#38;P 500 and Stoxx 600 companies reporting, more 
central bank meetings (including the BoE Thursday), and another Euro Area finance minister's videoconference. If 
you want a potential black swan curveball event then the German Constitutional Court issues its final verdict on the 
ECB's PSPP program tomorrow. What I know about the German constitutional legal system could be put on the 
back of a postage stamp and still leave some room. Nevertheless, the usual form here is a begrudging acceptance 
of the ECB's involvement in financing member states and we all move on. However, one to keep a little attention 
on.  Ahead of payrolls Friday, DB's US economists are forecasting an unprecedented -22m fall in nonfarm payrolls, 
which would by far be the biggest monthly decline in the data going back to 1939, with the previous record being 
'only' a -1.959m decline back in September 1945 just as WWII ended. They're also forecasting a rise in the 
unemployment rate to 18.0%, which would be the highest unemployment rate for the US since the same war. With 
the jobless numbers set to reach unprecedented levels, investors will also be paying attention to the more up-to-
date weekly initial jobless claims from the US on Thursday, which will cover the week up to May 2. The previous 6 
weeks have seen a total of over 30m claims, though the last 4 weeks in a row have seen a decline from the peak, 
offering hope that the most rapid period of job losses may have passed.  The other data that will gain attention this 
week are the PMI releases from around the world. Thanks to various public holidays, the releases will be more 
scattered this week, with PMIs from various G20 countries coming out each day. See the day-by-day calendar at 
the end for the full run down (along with all the other releases) but today sees the manufacturing numbers from 
those on Labour Day holiday on Friday.  Earnings season continues apace over the coming week, with 159 
S&#38;P 500 companies reporting and a further 104 in the STOXX 600. Highlights include AIG and Tyson Foods 
today, followed by Disney, Total, BNP Paribas and Fiat Chrysler tomorrow. Wednesday then sees reports from 
Novo Nordisk, PayPal, TMobile, General Motors, Credit Agricole, UniCredit and BMW. On Thursday, we'll hear from 
Bristol Myers Squibb, Danaher, Raytheon Technologies, Linde, ArcelorMittal, AB InBev, Nintendo, Uber, IAG and 
Air France-KLM. Lastly on Friday, Wirecard, Siemens and Nomura will be announcing.  Reviewing last week now 
and in it we waved goodbye to April - the best month for the S&#38;P 500 (+12.68%) since January 1987. The -
2.81% fall on Friday though meant that the index closed the week down -0.21%, the smallest weekly in either 
direction since the first week of the year. There was a pullback in technology stocks as earnings of large-cap US 
companies, most notably Apple and Amazon, disappointed late in the week. Consequently the NASDAQ fell -0.34% 
on the week (-3.20% Friday). On the other hand, European equities rose on a shortened week, with many countries 
closed for Labour Day on Friday. The Stoxx 600 gained +2.37% over the five days but they'll likely be some catch 
down today. Equity performance was fairly correlated on the week for those indices that were off on Friday, with the 
DAX up +5.08% (-2.22% Thursday), the Italian FTSE MIB gaining +4.93% (-2.09% Thursday), and the CAC rallying 
+4.07% (-2.12% Thursday). The FTSE, which was open on Friday, was up just +0.19% over the full week, after the 
-2.34% decline on Friday not helped by Shell (-14.24% on the week) cutting its dividend for the first time since 
1945. Asian equity indices also saw shortened weeks outside of the Nikkei, which declined by -2.84% Friday to 
finish the week up +1.86%. The CSI 300 gained +3.04% on a 4 day week, while the Kospi rose +3.10% on a 3 day 
week. In other risk markets, oil rebounded after 3 weeks of losses. WTI futures rose +16.77% last week (+4.99% 
Friday) to $19.78/barrel as demand may be turning a corner at the same time that OPEC+ and non-members both 
enact production cuts. Brent crude rose +23.32% on the week (+4.63% Friday), just the second weekly gain in the 
last ten weeks.  55% of S&#38;P 500 companies have now reported Q1 earnings. In aggregate earnings are 
missing by -2.5% (vs. beating by 3.4% in an average quarter) and have fallen 16.6% year-over-year. Blended EPS 
growth for the index looks set to contract by -13%, which would be the worst quarter since 2009. However this is 
driven by a large downside skew, with median company growth on track to be only modestly negative at -0.9%. 
Much like GDP earlier last week, these numbers are likely to be worse in Q2 because most of the shutdowns were 
enacted at the end of March.  With the pullback in US equities, the VIX rose +1.3pts to 37.19 last week (+3.0pts 
Friday). This was the first weekly rise since the SPX lows in the third week of March. Even as equity volatility 
increased slightly, credit spreads tightened slightly on the week - albeit complicated by the index rebalancing at the 
Global Stocks Tumble On Renewed US -China Tensions; US Airlines Plunge On Buffett Exit
end of the month. US HY cash spreads were -33bps tighter on the week (+7bps Friday), while IG was -18bps 
tighter on the week (+1bp Friday). In Europe, HY cash spreads were -8bps tighter over the shortened week, while 
IG was -13bps tighter.  Much like equities, core sovereign bond yields in the US and Europe diverged slightly last 
week. US 10yr Treasury yields were up +1.1bps (-2.8bps Friday) to finish at 0.612%, 7.1bps from the March all-time 
lows. Meanwhile, 10yr Bund yields fell -11.3bps to -0.59%, the lowest since March 13. Gilt yields fell -4.3 bps over 
the 5 days (+1.8 bps Friday) to 0.248%, just 9bps from the all-time lows in early March. Euro debt diverged in a 
similar manner. Spanish and French sovereign debt were -11.6 and -2.0 bps tighter, respectively, to Bunds, while 
Italian debt traded +3.7bps wider after the decision by Fitch to downgrade the country's credit rating to BBB- and an 
ECB meeting that disappointed on OMT guidance.  On the economic data front last Friday, UK mortgage approvals 
in March fell to their lowest level in seven years, while the final manufacturing PMI came in at 32.6, 0.3 below the 
flash reading. In the US, Markit Manufacturing PMIs were at 36.1 (36.7 expected), 0.8 below the flash reading of 
36.9. At the same time the ISM Manufacturing PMI came in stronger than expected at 41.5 (36.0 expected), down 
from 49.1 last month. The ISM measures continue to see significant upside contribution from supplier delivery 
delays, but this is driven by supply chain disruption rather than stronger fundamentals. So difficult to read too much 
into this stronger reading. [ 1]: http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/ih9Y1KD60PY/global-stocks-

May 04, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Irish budget carrier Ryanair said on 
Friday it planned to cut 3,000 pilot and cabin crew jobs, or 15% of staff, 'as a direct result of the unprecedented 
COVID-19 crisis'. The move comes after the airline predicted it would take until summer 2022 at the earliest before 
passenger demand recovers. 'The Ryanair Airlines will shortly notify their trade unions about its restructuring and 
job loss program, which will commence from July 2020. These plans will be subject to consultation but will affect all 
Ryanair Airlines, and may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid leave, and pay 
cuts of up to 20 percent, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers', it said in 
a statement. 
'Today we are announcing cuts of just over 15 percent, of which we have to lose regrettably about 3,000 mainly 
pilots and cabin crew over the next three to four months', CEO Michael O'Leary said, and added: 'We expect to be 
allowed by the European governments to go back in July or from July onwards. What we are facing now is a historic 
decline in air traffic in Europe for the next 12-18 months'. Last month, amid the crisis, Ryanair offered its planes to 
all EU governments[1], for rescue flights, as well as for the movement of vital medicines, personal protective 
equipment and emergency food supplies. It stressed that the planes used for the purpose will be disinfected on a 
daily basis. [ 1]: https://www.neweurope.eu/article/ryanair-expected-to-halt-all-flights-in-april-and-may/

May 01, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Reuters Ryanair[1] 
said it would fly less than 1% of its schedule in June, as the airline industry goes sideways in the midst of the 
coronavirus[2] pandemic. It also said it would cut about 15% of its workforce, totaling about 3,000 jobs, while 
exploring pay cuts and voluntary leaves for other employees. In a statement, the airline[3] accused European 
governments of providing unfair aid to competitors during the crisis. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[4]. The European low-cost airline Ryanair said Friday that it 
would operate less than 1% of its normal schedule in June and is planning to cut 3,000 jobs, warning that it expects 
its recovery from the coronavirus to take at least two years. Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, the 
Ireland-based carrier said that it would implement a restructuring program starting in July, eliminating the positions. 
The 3,000 jobs would equal about 15% of Ryanair's workforce. The airline said it expects to carry fewer than 
150,000 passengers from May through July, as travel restrictions and anxieties over the pandemic persist in 
Europe. It had originally projected 42.4 million passengers during the quarter. Although it said that it expected some 
demand to resume between July and September, it expected less than half of the 44.6 million passengers it had 
previously planned for. "Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing (to 2019 levels) will 
take at least 2 years, until summer 2022 at the earliest," the airline said in a statement[5] to investors, adding that it 
expected to report a net loss of over €100 million (about $109.8 million) for the quarter ending in June. In addition to 
the job cuts, which will mainly affect flight attendants and pilots, the airline is also looking at pay cuts of up to 20%, 
as well as offering unpaid leaves to some employees and closing bases across Europe. CEO Michael O'Leary has 
cut his pay by 50%. In the statement, Ryanair also accused European governments of bailing out competitors 
unfairly, saying that airlines such as Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, and Alitalia will be able to undercut the budget 
carrier on price. "When Ryanair returns to meaningful flying from July, the competitive landscape in Europe will be 
distorted by unprecedented volumes of State Aid from some EU Governments to their 'national' airlines," the 
company said. "Currently this amounts to over €30 billion." The global airline industry has been roiled by the 
coronavirus pandemic. Various stay-at-home orders, border closures, and calls for social distancing have tanked 
travel demand. Airlines have responded by suspending routes, cancelling flights, and grounding planes.NOW

May 01, 2020( Pressat: http://www.pressat.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  Friday 1 May, 2020 LONDON, United 
Kingdom, 1 May 2020Up to 7bn is owed to consumers due to flights and holidays which have been cancelled by 
airlines and tour operators due to the Coronavirus crisis. Whilst some airlines are offering refunds, many others are 
delaying refunds or, in the most egregious cases of all, point blank refusing refunds. 
Amongst those refusing refunds, or failing to give definitive timescales for payment, are Ryanair, KLM, and Air 
France, all of whom have released clear announcements that they will not be issuing refunds. Notwithstanding the 
challenges which the airline industry is facing during the pandemic, airlines must obey consumer protection laws 
which are in place to protect the customers' rights and interests.According to the EU Regulation 261/2004 (airlines) 
and EU Directive 2015/2302 (travel package), both mandatory laws, passengers with cancelled flights must be 
offered a choice of re-routing under comparable transport conditions, to their final destination at the earliest 
opportunity; or reimbursement of the full cost of the ticket at the price at which it was bought, within seven days. 
Whilst suggestions have been made that the rights under these laws may be suspended, consumers may still seek 
full refunds and compensation for distress and inconvenience under the Consumer Rights Act and the Consumer 
Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations. These are UK laws and any EU decision will have no impact upon 
these.SPG Law, the leading class action law firm in the UK, is today launching litigation against Ryanair, KLM, and 
Air France on behalf of consumers. Hundreds of affected passengers have already contacted SPG Law and test 
claims will be issued in the English courts in the coming days. The lawsuits will not only demand that the airlines 
fully refund the costs of customers' tickets, but also seek additional damages for stress, inconvenience, and 
commercial misconduct by the airlines. In order to be represented by SPG Law, affected passengers must be 
residents of the United Kingdom who have purchased tickets with Ryanair, KLM or Air France. SPG Law operates 
on a no-win, no-fee basis, and if successful will offer claimants 100% of the refund of the cost of their flights but will 
charge 50% of any damages recovered for stress, inconvenience and commercial misconduct. SPG Law Managing 
Partner, Thomas Goodhead, said in regard to the airlines' misconduct that 'Whilst all of us who travel frequently are 
able to empathise with the commercial conditions that airlines face, it is highly unethical that they should seek to 
finance their businesses by unlawfully withholding monies which belong to consumers. After the crisis is over, 
consumers will remember which airlines acted honourably and which ones chose to prioritise their balance sheets 
over their customers' bank accounts.' To make a claim or for more information regarding the airline refunds' class-

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-to-axe-up-to-3000-jobs-as-it-warns-recovery-could-take-2-
years/Ryanair is preparing to cut up to 15 per cent of its 19,000 workforce as it becomes the latest airline to warn 
that the aviation industry faces a slow recovery from the upheaval wrought by coronavirus.Europe's largest low-cost 
carrier said it expected it would take at least two years for a return to last year's levels of passenger demand and 
pricing, as it laid out plans to cut further costs. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's outspoken chief executive, said his 
outlook on the recovery had changed over the past week in light of the €9bn bailout Air France-KLM had won from 
the French and Dutch governments, and the state aid Lufthansa is expected to receive. 
He said the 'whole competitive market has now been completely turned on its head'. 'The weakest airlines going 
into the crisis — Lufthansa, Air France, KLM, Alitalia — who were going to in normal circumstances have to 
restructure and retrench are now going to be enormously enriched with this state aid doping.I think what we are 
facing now is that . . . they'll be able to make life very difficult for the well-run airlines like ourselves, BA and 
easyJet.' Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had to respond by downsizing the airline for the next 12 months. 'Unless we have 
materially lower costs for the next 12-24 months, we won't be able to operate successfully in a market where air 
fares are going to be materially lower.' Ryanair intends to axe as many as 3,000 pilot and cabin crew jobs, and 
introduce pay cuts of up to 20 per cent as well as close a number of aircraft bases around Europe until air travel 
recovers. Mr O'Leary will extend his 50 per cent pay cut for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021. He 
said it probably should be considering job cuts of up a third of its workforce, and could not rule out further 
reductions later, but said it was attempting to preserve jobs. Ryanair's comments come as any optimism over a 
speedy recovery for the industry is evaporating, forcing carriers to move from furloughing workers to making 
redundancies. On Tuesday, British Airways revealed plans to axe almost 30 per cent of its 42,000-strong workforce 
after its parent company IAG warned that it could take several years to return to 2019 traffic levels. SAS, the 
Scandinavian airline, said it would permanently cut half — 5,000 — of its staff. Ryanair on Friday said it expected to 
carry no more than 50 per cent of its original traffic target of 44.6m passengers between July and September. For 
the full year, ending March 2021, it is forecasting fewer than 100m passengers — 35 per cent below its original 
target of 154m. In April, May and June, it expects to carry just 150,000 passengers — 99.5 per cent short of its 
previous target of 42.4m passengers. The carrier said it was also reviewing its growth plans and aircraft orders, 
adding that it was in 'active negotiations' with both Boeing and Laudamotion's A320 lessors to cut the number of 
Ryanair to axe up to 3,000 jobs as it warns recovery could take 2 years
planned aircraft deliveries over the next 24 months. The market update comes just a week after Mr O'Leary gave a 
bullish outlook for a recovery in air travel, outlining plans for the airline to resume 80 per cent of flights by 
September, provided that flying in Europe could restart from early July. However, he admitted that these planes 
would have low load factors. On Friday, Mr O'Leary said there was still a chance Ryanair could reach 2019 traffic 
volumes by next summer but said it would take until 2022 for 2019 pricing levels to return. He confirmed Ryanair 
had also filed a legal complaint to the European Commission over its state aid concerns, and said it would launch 
legal action by the end of the month. Read more: Ryanair to axe up to 3,000 jobs as it warns recovery could take 2

national carrier Lufthansa is seeking a €10 billion ($11 billion) bailout that would give the German government a 
25.1% stake in the company, German weekly Der Spiegel reported Friday. 
According to the news magazine, the government will hold over half of the stake — €5.5 billion — as a silent 
partner, for which they will receive a guaranteed return of 9%. The state-owned development bank Kreditanstalt for 
Wiederaufbau (KFW) will also contribute another €3.5 billion, backed by the German government. Read more:

comment on the plan, though Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told German daily the Passauer Neue Presse that 
"taxpayers can count on us not to conduct these talks naively."Flights down 99%Lufthansa is currently flying around

Apr 30, 2020( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Air travel 
is bound to look fundamentally different from the times before the coronavirus crisis. Changes will be visible at the 
airport and in the cabin, as Andreas Spaeth reports.Michael O'Leary is against it. "If they do that, we're not returning 
to flying at all," the Ryanair chief executive recently announced defiantly. There is already an intense discussion on 
how passenger air travel can be resumed once the sweeping restrictions to contain the coronavirus are lifted. 
One of the key questions is: should middle seats on aircraft be left vacant?"The middle seat doesn't deliver any 
social distancing, so it's kind of an idiotic idea that doesn't deliver anything anyway," O'Leary told the Financial 
Times. If such a regulation were to be imposed by Ryanair's home country, Ireland, then "either the government 
pays for the middle seat or we won't fly."One thing seems to be clear: There is no easy return to the world as we 
knew it in aviation before the coronavirus, likely none at all.Business models in jeopardyThis threatens the business 
model of an airline like Ryanair, which is known to squeeze in as many passengers as possible and keeps its 
aircraft on the ground for only short turnarounds before sending them up again, allowing it to fly more than others. 
This model might be fundamentally thrown into doubt with the now required regular, thorough cleaning of aircraft 
and lengthier boarding procedures to keep passengers apart from each other, which would inevitably increase 
ground times.So far, there's been no evidence of any infections on board aircraft. The aviation industry keeps 
stressing that cabin air is at least as clean as the air in operation theaters, thanks to high-performance air particle 
filters. The risks are further mitigated by the cabin air streaming downward. It hasn't also been proven that vacant 
middle seats lower the risk of infection. Still, many airlines like Lufthansa Group, including Eurowings, currently 
block middle seats. Likewise, easyJet is promising travel without a direct seat neighbor at least initially once it 
restarts operations."It's purely a cosmetic measure and there is no scientific justification that it would help," says 
Shashank Nigam, CEO of aviation consultancy Simpliflying. But psychology does play a role currently. "We will 
continue to enable a safe travel experience that has to become visible for the passenger to build up trust," promises 
Ingo Wuggetzer, vice president of Cabin Marketing at Airbus.Far-reaching changes aheadSimpliflying paints a 
sobering picture of how air travel might look like in the age of sanitized travel. "The changes will be as far-reaching, 
if not more so, than the ones introduced after 9/11, and will be here with us to stay," claims Nigam."In addition to 
security checks, you will have a sanitation element added on top." In a recent report, Simpliflying says a journey by 
air will roughly look somewhat like this: As part of the online check-in process, passengers will be required to 
upload an immunity passport confirming the presence of antibodies for COVID-19. At the airport itself, travelers will 
be required to arrive at least four hours before departure.Even before passengers can enter the actual check-in 
area, they will have to pass through a disinfection tunnel and thermal scanners. A newly founded Transport Health 
Post-corona air travel: Flying under the plexiglass hood
Authority, similar to the TSA created in the US after 9/11, could define standards in cooperation with the World 
Health Organization and airport and airline groups."We have to get our act together to implement similar measures 
all over the world that the traveling public understands," demands Christoph Müller, an airline veteran and former 
CEO of Aer Lingus and Malaysia Airlines, among others. "We need a kind of safety net, there's nothing worse than 
people not getting on board for fear of getting infected," says Müller.But if the regulations laid out by Simplifying 
become a reality, they may also put off many from using air travel in the future.Flying no fun anymore?In addition to 
new regulations expected to be introduced by many countries, it will become mandatory to wear masks while flying. 
This is also suggested by the German airline lobby BDL in its concept paper on restarting air travel.It pledges to 
make sure that during boarding, flight and deplaning, every passenger wears a mask. It also talks about an 
obligation for passengers to bring their own masks. In Canada, this regulation already exists; in the US, JetBlue has 
become the first airline to impose it on passengers.Lufthansa passengers are to be compelled to wear a mask 
covering the nose and mouth and to be requested to keep them on throughout the flight, with the new measure 
going into force on May 4. The airline said it planned to require the wearing of masks on all the airlines in the group 
at least until August 31. In the future, all checked bags as well as cabin bags will go through a UV disinfection 
process to be "sanitagged," as the authors call the hygiene approval, which would include other health checks as 
well. Gone are the times of mad dashes straight to security and to the gate. Soon, it might be inevitable to be at the 
checkpoint two hours before departure.The actual boarding would take place in small groups keeping in mind social 
distancing norms, with the jet bridge potentially serving as another disinfection tunnel. On board, many things are 
likely to change, starting with the seats. For the first time, seat manufacturers have now revealed their designs for 
the post-corona era.Aviointeriors from Italy is promoting its "Glassafe" design featuring plexiglass hoods in the 
shoulder and head sections of every seat, reminiscent of old telephone booths. The more elaborate "Janus" seat, 
named after the two-faced Roman god, features a middle seat turned 180 and facing the rear of the aircraft, fenced 
off from its neighbors by plexiglass walls."A hygiene divider could be an intelligent combination of the requirements 
of comfort/privacy and hygiene/distance," says Ingo Wuggetzer of Airbus.No sales yetSo far no airline has ordered 
such post-corona cabin furnishing. Asian company Haeco is taking a pragmatic approach in proposing to alternate 
seat rows with rows of stored cargo in the cabin. This would not only create more distancing but also provide better 
aircraft loads at times like now, when demand for cargo capacity is bigger than for seats.In any case, passenger 
experience will soon be very different: Cabin crews will wear protective clothing, the passengers will wear gloves 
and masks, with the cabin being fogged for disinfection before departure and the crew offering hand sanitizer every 
half hour, while in Business and First Class, only packaged and sealed meals will be distributed.Dedicated inflight 
janitors will ensure cleanliness of toilets and galleys throughout the entire flight. After landing, the immunity passport 
will be verified again and one has to pass through a thermal scanner, bags will be "sanitagged" again before being 
placed on the conveyor belt. Like this, flying probably won't be much fun anymore for many."Depending on time and 
availability of a vaccine, some elements will be kept, others will disappear," predicts Ingo Wuggetzer.

Apr 30, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, Delta 
Air Lines DAL[1] initiated the first-quarter 2020 earnings season for the airline stocks. The carrier incurred a loss as 
the coronavirus-led weak air-travel demand resulted in an 18.2% fall in passenger revenues.Similarly, Southwest 
Airlines LUV[2] suffered itsfirst quarterly loss in almost a decade[3]with passenger revenues dropping 19% in the 
first quarter. Moreover, Copa Holdings CPA[4] came out with lackluster preliminary first-quarter results. Detailed 
results are scheduled to be out on May 6.Further, due to coronavirus-related weakness in passenger revenues, 
United Airlines UAL[5] reported bleak preliminary results in the previous week[6].Highlights of the Past Week's Top 
Stories1. Delta incurred a loss (excluding 33 cents from non-recurring items) of 51 cents for the March quarter, 
narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 72 cents. 
However, the bottom line came in against the year-ago quarter's reported earnings of 96 cents per share (on an 
adjusted basis). With Delta making significant capacity cuts to match the coronavirus-induced sharp decrease in 
traffic, capacity (measured in available seat miles) contracted 5.7% to 58.88 billion. With the decline in traffic (down 
16.6%) outpacing the capacity reduction, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was down 960 basis 
points to 73.1%[7].2. Southwest Airlines posted a loss of 15 cents per share (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring 
items) in the first quarter of 2020, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents. In the year-ago period, 
the company delivered earnings of 70 cents per share. The results reflect the coronavirus-induced plunge in 
passenger demand. Meanwhile, operating revenues of $4,234 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
$4,397 million. Additionally, the top line declined 17.8% year over year[8].3. Copa Holdings expects total revenues 
of $595.5 million for the quarter, indicating a decline of 11.4% from the year-ago reported figure. Also, operating 
profit is projected at $98.7 million with an operating margin of 16.6%[9].4. Ryanair's RYAAY[10] CEO Michael 
O'Leary warned of job cuts if flights remain suspended post May due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. As of 
now, management assured all its employees of no pay cut for April and May. Per a Reuters report[11], he said that 
the carrier may have to lay off 10-20% of its workforce in winter.5.In a bid to break the chain of coronavirus, JetBlue 
Airways JBLU[12] announced a new policy for flying. Per the policy, passengers flying with this Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold) low-cost carrier will require to wear a mask to cover their nose and mouth throughout their entire journey.

Stapleton Airlines aren't used to losing money. For years, the core group of US airlines raked in hundreds of 
millions of dollars in pure profit, which they spent freely on stock buybacks and service expansions. American 
Airlines, the largest domestic carrier, for instance, saw profits increase from $690 million in 2012 to $2.179 billion in 
2019. That is, until it all came crashing down.[1] Delta was the first airline to report its first quarter earnings this 
week[2], and things aren't looking good. It expects to lose $534 million for the three-month period, of which only the 
latter half was fully affected by the absolute plunge in travel. 
The other airlines are set to report in the coming week — but don't expect things to get much better. United forecast 
in a surprise release that it would likely lose $2.1 billion[3] for the quarter as revenues fall 90%. So when will things 
get better? Your guess is as good as mine. As it stands now, nearly three quarters of Americans say they won't fly 
for at least four months, according to a Fortune-SurveyMonkey poll. Adios, summer vacation plans (Don't forget,

Apr 24, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Porsche Porsche is 
introducing new, tech-packed infotainment systems that owners can swap into their classic cars. The new "Porsche 
Classic Communication Management" systems allow owners of classic Porsches to have modern conveniences like 
Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth, USB ports, and touchscreens. The two new systems are compatible with Porsche 
models ranging from the 1960s to the 2000s. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. The market for 
classic Porsches is perhaps hotter than ever, with prices of vintage 911s, 928s, and even 944s skyrocketing in 
recent years. 
But the company is betting that even fans of its older models will appreciate some modern touches. Porsche is 
introducing a pair of new infotainment systems[2] that will allow owners of Porsches from the 1960s to the early 
2000s to retrofit their cars with modern tech features like a touchscreen, Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth, an SD-card slot, 
and USB ports. The new head units, called "Porsche Classic Communication Management," also receive digital 
radio stations. Owners of older cars are alwaysable to swap out the factory head unit in their car for an aftermarket 
infotainment system, but Porsche's newly available systems sport the company's logo and blend seamlessly into 
older dashboards, the company said. One PCCM[3] version — compatible with Porsches from the 1960s through 
the early 1990s — has rotary knobs, push buttons, and a modest, 3.5-inch touchscreen display. The PCCM Plus[4] 
option, built for newer models from 1997 to 2005, comes with a seven-inch touchscreen. At current exchange rates, 
the new infotainment systems will run you roughly $1,550 for the standard version and $1,730 for the Plus 
option.NOW WATCH: How waste is dealt with on the world's largest cruise ship[5]See Also: The CEO of Ryanair,

View original post here[2]. Submitted by Michael Every of Rabobank  Suspicious Minds  It is perhaps the oldest 
Middle East oil trick in the book: you want higher oil prices, threaten to start breaking things. Yesterday US 
President Trump gave an order authorizing the navy to use 'overwhelming lethal force' against any Iranian gunboats 
which harass American ships - and up popped oil. Of course, it probably won't last long given supply-demand 
imbalances and the fact that Iran will now just switch to another way to harass and annoy the US in the region (of 
which it has many); and surely even the most suspicious of minds must concede that starting a war with Iran is 
pretty low on Trump's to-do list going into the 2020 election? As such, the ripple effects from lower oil prices are 
going to continue to be felt in both some obvious and some unusual places. 
For example, one would think China is a big winner from this oil-price war - yet Caixin is reporting that the Bank of 
China sold the May oil contract to wealthy retail investors using fund names like 'crude oil treasure', who 
subsequently got absolutely crushed.  Jailhouse Rock  The UK government still can't find masks. It still can't tell us 
to wear masks. It still can't do mass testing. But what it can do is tell the public what should have been obvious from 
the start: that social distancing measures will have to stay in place for the rest of the year in order to control COVID-
19. We have made clear previously what the implications of this are: you stop a lockdown and yet you don't go back 
to normal.  Please explain the functional business model of a restaurant already running on tight margins when 
customer turnover needs to be reduced by 50% to allow safe 2-meter gaps between tables, and where everyone is 
sitting there enjoying the food and drink and ambience in a mask. Imagine what the meal will have to cost to make a 
profit for the poor restaurateur; and imagine if subsequently the air-conditioning has to be turned off too given there 
is evidence that this also spreads the virus.  Need another simple example? RyanAir has announced that it won't be 
flying again with 'idiotic' social distancing rules, according to its CEO, which he proposes as middle seats being left 
empty when surely the 2-metre logic should be only 3-4 people per row, and two rows empty between each 
occupied one? On the more prudent basis an economy class ticket will surely be closer to business class fares - in 
which case the potential number of people willing and able to fly is going to be even lower than projected (an 
exponential/fat tail effect where less means less, just as more can mean more).  Likewise, Australia is now going to 
keep its international borders closed for another three to four months at least, even as local lockdowns are partially 
eased - so no international tourism until August at the very earliest. If anyone can afford to fly there when the skies 
do open again.  Of course, the US is also closing down to immigration for 60 days (except it isn't: there are visa 
Rabobank : You Can Stop The Lockdown But You Won't Go Back To Normal
loopholes as big as the gaps in Trump's Wall) even as it is seeing some states boldly reopenand Trump is suddenly 
hedging his bets by allowing governors to reopen while being publicly opposed in the case of Georgia. Heads he 
wins, tails he doesn't lose. We shall see within weeks if this action means the economy picks up or virus infections 
do..  Heartbreak Hotel  Consequently, even as Australia saw its services PMI at just 19.6(!) and as Japan recorded 
the worst manufacturing PMI since 2009 at 43.7 and the worst services PMI ever at 22.8, consider that for the 
services sector on which so much of the modern global economy is built, normal service is not anywhere close to 
being resumed. Other global PMIs follow today and are expected to see Eurozone manufacturing at 38.0, down 
from 44.5, and services also at 22.8, down from 26.4, while the UK consensus is for 42.0 and 27.8, respectively, 
and for the US 35.0 and 30.0 - making the US a relative outperformer.  Meanwhile, today we will all be looking at 
the US initial claims data to see if another 4.5 million people lose their jobs, taking the total to 26.5 million in five 
weeks, or if it's slightly better or worse than that.  A Little Less Conversation  Today also has a 'make or break' 
European meeting on what to do to save the economy and, according to the French and Portuguese leaders, the 
EU and Euro too. Yesterday saw the ECB set some limits when it prudently underlined that it is not allowed to buy 
government securities directly, as this is illegal, and that 'helicopter money' would also be problematic for it; this is 
the same ECB that is literally begging governments to spend vastly more so it has bonds to buy in the secondary 
market (which is not just legal, but standard policy) and which is now about to buy corporate junk-bonds too. 
(Rather ironically, yesterday saw data show that Eurozone debt-to-GDP in 2019 dropped from 85.8% to 84.1%)  But 
back to the politicians. By videoconference (underlining the lost service-sector revenue to a hotel and caterer 
somewhere) a temporary EUR300bn recovery fund is being discussed along with a EUR200bn recovery and 
resilience facility, EUR50bn in repurposed cohesion funds, and two EUR200bn funds 'to protect the EU's internal 
markets'. And that appears to be it, even though somehow this is EUR 2trn in some headlines. Italy, which 
yesterday announced that its fiscal deficit will be 10% of GDP in 2020 even though there is precious little stimulus 
taking place is, according to a report in the FT, now willing to avoid the debt mutualisation issue and instead favour 
ultra-long maturity or perpetual bond issuance. One wonders how the Usual Suspects in northern Europe will feel 
about that compromise. Is the numeric response still 999?  I won't allow myself to get sucked into the classic Euro 
game of mind-stultifying fudge, acronyms, and deck-chair rearranging. Instead, I will quote Bloomberg directly: 'The 
'roadmap' EU Council President Charles Michel distributed to national delegations ahead of the video conference 
contained no details on the amount, the specific objectives, the time frame or the nature of the investment needed 
to get the bloc back on track. Leaders aren't expected to reach a decision this week and a final package may not be 
ready for at least six months, according to a French official.'  SIX MONTHS?! And then action on a scale that looks 
completely out of kilter with the economic damage being wrought. Euro-committees are all very fine and good, and I 
am always told they work best when in a genuine crisis (or only in a crisis) - but where is The King when you need 
him? 
He 
appears 
to 
have 
left 
the 
building.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-boss-michael-oleary-says-airline-wont-fly-with-idiotic-social-
distancing-rules/Ryanair planes won't return to the skies if the airline is forced to leave the middle seat empty to 
comply with 'idiotic' in-flight social distancing rules, its chief executive, Michael O'Leary, has said.The boss of the 
no-frills carrier, which has thrived by packing its flights as full as possible with passengers lured by low prices, has 
previously said that blocking out the space in between seats is 'nonsense' that would have no beneficial effect. He 
doubled down on the comments on Wednesday, saying that if governments insisted on social distancing measures, 
then Ryanair's business model would be in tatters and the carrier would not fly. 
O'Leary said that Ryanair had already told the Irish government that if it imposes the restriction, then 'either the 
government pays for the middle seat or we won't fly'. The Dublin-based carrier's business model relies on flying as 
frequently as possible, stripping out costs and running an extremely high 'load factor', the aviation industry term for 
how full planes are. 'We can't make money on 66% load factors,' he said. 'Even if you do that, the middle seat 
doesn't deliver any social distancing, so it's kind of an idiotic idea that doesn't achieve anything anyway,' he added, 
in an interview with the Financial Times. The global airline industry's trade body, Iata, has predicted huge 
ramifications for airlines as a result of Covid-19, with lost revenues this year set to hit $314bn (255bn). Iata said 
earlier this week that any rules designed to minimise contagion in the skies would temporarily put an end to the 
cheap air travel model pioneered by Ryanair, forcing carriers to raise prices by 50% or go bust. Ryanair's no-frills 
rival easyJet has said it expects socially distanced flights to be possible in the short term, given that demand for air 
travel is likely to be subdued in any case, even after lockdown restrictions ease off. O'Leary said European airlines 
should instead take their cue from Asia and impose different safety measures, such as forcing passengers to wear 
masks or checking their temperature at the airport. Ryanair flew more than 152 million people last year, putting it at 
the top of the league table of European airlines, a position that gives O'Leary a particularly influential voice in the 
industry. He sounded a more upbeat tone than some of his rivals, predicting a return to normal passenger numbers 
by summer 2021, provided a vaccine for Covid-19 can be developed. He said the airline would be able to pick up 
business from rivals that collapse as a result of the pandemic, which has already forced Virgin Australia to file for 
bankruptcy and left Ryanair's European rival Norwegian Air fighting for its survival. Airlines including Ryanair have 
faced criticism for dragging their feet on giving refunds for cancelled flights, as they look to conserve cash during

the pandemic. Some of the industry's biggest players are also trying to convince governments to bail them out, after 
air travel all but ceased. Read more: Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary says airline won't fly with 'idiotic' social

Apr 23, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Reuters Ryanair's 
CEO said the airline will not fly if it is forced to keep middle seats empty to maintain social distancing to stop the 
coronavirus spread. Michael O'Leary told the Financial Times[1] that the idea would be "entirely ineffective," making 
it impossible for the airline to make money while also not keeping passengers far enough apart anyway. "We can't 
make money on 66% load factors," he said, adding: "The middle seat doesn't deliver any social distancing, so it's 
kind of an idiotic idea that doesn't achieve anything anyway." Some airlines have said they will keep empty seats 
between passengers, and the EU said social distancing rules will need to be in place. 
Ryanair is an Irish airline. Ryanair, like most other airlines, has had to ground most of its flights, but O'Leary said it 
expects most flights to resume this year if a middle seat rule is not put in place. Visit Business Insider's homepage 
for more stories[2]. The CEO of Ryanair, one of the world's largest airlines, said his planes won't fly if the airline has 
to keep the middle seat empty to comply with "idiotic" social distancing rules due to the coronavirus[3]. Michael 
O'Leary told the Financial Times[4] that the proposal would be "entirely ineffective" — even as experts proposed 
it[5] and some airlines have agreed to it as a way to keep social distancing in place as countries start to reopen and 
more flights resume. O'Leary said that the Irish airline's plans to start flying more would be ruined by "some entirely 
ineffective social distancing measures like having middle seats empty because if middle seats are empty we're not 
returning to flying at all." He said that the airline had told the Irish government that if it tried to impose such a rule 
then "either the government pays for the middle seat or we won't fly."O'Leary also said that the airline could not 
make a profit by having so few people on planes, and that simply not having anyone sitting in a middle seat would 
not leave people far enough apart to create effective social distancing anyway. "We can't make money on 66% load 
factors. Even if you do that, the middle seat doesn't deliver any social distancing, so it's kind of an idiotic idea that 
doesn't achieve anything anyway," he said. The low-cost airline, which flies primarily in Europe, is the world's 
largest airline by the number of routes, and was in 2019 itranked as the world's fifth-biggest airline by the number of 
seats[6] available to passengers.'If social distancing is imposed, cheap travel is over'The idea that planes should fly 
without a middle seat passenger has been recommended by analysts, [7]and the EU's Transport Commissioner, 
Adina Valean, said some social distancing rules will need to be in place in airports and planes, though she did not 
specify whether there would be rules about middle seats. Long-haul airline Emirates said this week[8] that it will

keep empty seats between individuals and groups on flights, while US airline Delta said it will leave middle seats 
empty[9] to "help customers and employees practice social distancing."Alexandre de Juniac, the head of 
International Air Transport Association (IATA) — the airline industry's global trade body — told Reuters[10] that 
airlines are likely going to have to keep the middle seat empty on flights from now on. But he has also warned[11] 
that social distancing measures could particularly harm low-cost airlines, as they would be forced to increase ticket 
prices. "So it means that if social distancing is imposed, cheap travel is over," he said. It is not yet clear how 
effective removing the middle passenger would be for social distancing. The BBC reported[12] that, on an average 
plane, you would need to be more than four seats apart from other people in order to bethe recommended two 
meters or six feet away from each other. Health experts have been supportive of removing the middle seat in the 
short term, even as they acknowledged that it may not be economically sustainable in the long term, the BBC 
added. Like the rest of the industry, Ryanair's flights have been decimated by the virus. As of March, Ryanair was 
operating fewer than 20 flights a day[13] —less than 1% of their usual daily average of 2,500.O'Leary said the 
airline expects to run around 40% of its flights in July if air travel is resumed by then, and said that around 50% to 
60% of the seats would be filled. He said he expects to run around 80% of its flights by September, but said that 
these plans would be ruined if the airline couldn't fill the middle seat. The pandemic has already forced some 
airlines to shut, is expected to cost airlines hundreds of billions of dollars, and could cause low-cost fares to 
disappear[14]. But O'Leary is positive about his own airline's future, expecting normal traffic to return by summer 
2021 and for Ryanair to be fueled by rivals collapsing.NOW WATCH: We tested a machine that brews beer at the

used to advertise a price that would then rise in the later stages of the booking process due to additional fees. An 
EU court has ruled in favor of Italian authorities who said the practice was incorrect.Ryanair's policy of not including 
surcharges in its initial online prices was deemed unlawful by the EU's top court on Thursday.The Court of Justice 
of the European Union (CJEU) came to the conclusion of wrongdoing after the Italian Competition Authority

additional fees for check-in and transactions made by credit card.Read more: Ryanair boss accused of racism after

food-will-rot-in-the-fields/British crops may 'rot in the fields' unless 80,000 farm workers are found, a farming 
association has warned - with a private charter plane of 180 Romanian fruit pickers due to land at Stansted airport 
tomorrow to tackle the shortages.The stark warning comes after producers issued a nationwide appeal for Brits join 
a new 'Land Army' of farm workers to pick fruit and vegetables amid the coronavirus lockdown. They will then be 
taken to Lincolnshire by bus, with the flight believed to be just the first of six. The Country Land & Business 
Association has admitted the number of British volunteers is still not enough, with a spokesman saying that they 
wouldn't be surprised if more foreign workers are flown in to avoid food 'rotting in the fields'. CLA President Mark 
Bridgeman said: 'Over 30,000 people have come forward to help farmers[1], following the call to 'Feed the Nation', 
through the COVID-19 pandemic. 
'This is great news and shows a tremendous attitude at these difficult times. But this excellent response in not 
enough - we need 80,000 people to ensure fruit and vegetables are picked on time this summer. 'Where it is 
possible and safe to do so in the current circumstances, bringing in workers from overseas to help meet the shortfall 
is the right thing to do if we want to keep the supermarkets stocked. 'However we would strongly encourage people 
from across the country to keep coming forward and signing up with recruitment agencies. 'There are good jobs 
available and great opportunities for those currently furloughed, unemployed or students.' Tomorrow's flight is 
coming from Bucharest to London. Surrey-based Air Charter Service said a private farming company in the UK has 
paid for Thursday's flight. It did not name the firm. An Airbus A320 aircraft will be used, at an estimated cost of 200-
250 per seat. Air Charter Service confirmed that an airline based at Stansted would operate the flight, which was 
booked last week. Carriers based at the Essex airport include Ryanair, Jet2.com and Tui Airways. The workers on 
the Boeing 737 will be taken by bus to farms across the southeast of the UK and Lincolnshire. Passengers on board 
the aircraft will be required to maintain social distancing guidelines and will not be allowed to leave Romania if they 
display any symptoms of Covid-19. At least 10 other flights have been arranged by Air Charter Service to take farm 
workers from Romania and Bulgaria to Germany. The move has shone the spotlight on the so-called 'Land Army' 
initiative, which was supposed to fill Britain's farming needs with British workers currently at home amid the 
lockdown. The 'Land Army' scheme is being led by Concordia, a charity which provides seasonal labour for farms, 
180 Romanian fruit pickers fly into Stansted as farming association warns 'food will rot in the fields'
as well as HOPS and Fruitful. Concordia says almost 90 per cent of applicants are British citizens - and half have 
either been furloughed or out of work completely because of coronavirus. They add their roles for April have been 
filled, but they are still looking for more workers from May onwards. Stephanie Maurel, the chief executive of 
Concordia, said pickers earn an average of 350 a week for around 40 hours of work. The least they will be paid is 
the national minimum wage of 8.72 per hour - but the faster workers could be paid up to 15 per hour depending on 
how much they pick. The working day will begin between 5am and 6am, finishing in the early afternoon to avoid 
physical work in the hottest part of the day, A spokesman said: 'Concordia is working with Fruitful and HOPS to help 
find people to fill positions on UK farms. 'Successful applicants will receive training on the farm (and are paid to 
undertake this training) and can be assured that all farms, many of which are open fields, are following the correct 
procedures around safe working conditions during the Coronavirus outbreak. 'Housing is always provided although 
participants do not have to take it up.' 'To date we have had more than 32,000 applications of interest in the 
programme - from people all over the UK, and beyond. 'Of those 13% are then opting to interview for a role (an 
automatic process) - currently just over 4,000. We are now matching these people to roles and placing them on UK 
farms. 'Almost 90% of applicants are from UK citizens. Half of whom have lost their livelihoods due to the COVID-
19 outbreak. Only 30% have worked in farming in the past.' The British Growers Association says around 6,000 
pickers are needed from mid-April to pick asparagus, and the same again to pick salads and lettuce. By May at 
least 30,000 people will be needed to pick strawberries and at least 10,000 more to pick soft fruits such as 
raspberries. Later in the summer another 10,000 will be needed to pick apples and pears. Next month tens of 
thousands will be needed cauliflowers, cucumbers and spring greens and other common vegetables like onions. 
Farmers and food plants hit with staff shortages will be allowed to recruit furloughed workers from other businesses 
to 'feed the nation'. The move comes in response to warnings of chaos in some sectors and fears crops will be left 
to rot in the fields. Thousands of businesses, from retailers to pubs, have put their staff on furlough, which means 
the taxpayer will pay them 80 per cent of their wage. Originally, this payment was denied to the company if these 
workers went on to find a second job to bring in cash. However, the Treasury has updated its guidance to say: 'You 
may undertake other employment while your current employer has placed you on furlough, and this will not affect 
the grant that they can claim under the scheme.' The net effect is that people on furlough could receive 80 per cent 
of their pay from their main employer while collecting a second wage for fruit picking. Importantly, these people 
must be able to return to work for their main employer as and when required. It comes as the Government's 
watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, today warned the economy could shrink by more than a third this 
quarter alone with two million people made jobless if the lockdown continues for two more months. Shocking 
analysis from the OBR underlines the trade-offs being made to combat the deadly disease by putting the country 
into lockdown. It warns curbs staying in place for three months will slash GDP by 35 per cent, with unemployment 
soaring to 10 per cent and the government's deficit hitting 273billion - the highest level since the Second World 
War. The watchdog ominously said it was assumed 'for now' there will not be any permanent economic damage, 
and much of the crash will be unwound as pent-up demand is unleashed when the lockdown finally ends. However, 
the resulting 13 per cent year-on-year drop will still be worse than anything in the last century. Responding to the 
chilling scenario - which emerged as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted the worst global downturn 
since the Great Depression in 1929 - Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: 'People should know there is hardship ahead.' 
The apocalyptic figures emerged after Dominic Raab moved to quash the idea of an imminent loosening, with the 
UK now facing restrictions until at least May 7. But there is growing alarm about the potential death toll from 
economic misery, with life expectancy set to take a major hit. Doctors have also warned that suspending all non-
urgent NHS operations to focus on coronavirus cases means more cancer and heart disease patients will die. The 
Cabinet is divided over whether to push to ease the lockdown soon, with some saying the public is obeying social 
distancing too well and that people must be urged to keep working where possible. But concerns have been raised 
that it is impossible to lift the curbs at the moment anyway because the public is so strongly in favour of them 
staying in place, and would simply refuse to go back to normal. Read more: 180 Romanian fruit pickers fly into

Apr 11, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  REUTERS/Andrew 
Yates Airlines have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, in many cases grounding their entire fleets, 
furloughing thousands of staff, and issuing dire warnings about their future. Some budget airlines in Europe have 
already collapsed. Even after the pandemic ends, changes in the market could drive up the famously low ticket 
prices that opened up the continent, or force airlines to change the way they fly. But airlines' best call may ultimately 
be to tempt back travellers through cheap flights — if they can afford it. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. As governments around the world close their borders and 
advise against travel, demand for air travel has plummeted, causing airlines to ground their entire fleets[2]. Airlines 
have left planes sitting idle on runways, and furloughed hundreds of thousands of staff. The head of the 
International Air Transport Association, an organization representing the world's airlines, said[3]"the air transport 
industry is in its deepest crisis ever." The pandemic has left virtually all of the world's airlines at risk of 
bankruptcy[4]. Some have already collapsed. One analyst said that, even in the best-case scenario, pre-outbreak 
levels of demand will not return until at least mid-2021[5].And when that demand does return, the industry will not 
be the same as before. There's uncertainty about which airlines will survive, how many people will want to fly after a 
pandemic, and the what kind of new precautions airlines may take in future. John Strickland, an independent air 
transport consultant, told Business Insider that one thing is for sure: "Aviation is going to be smaller." And among 
the things at risk are Europe's famously cheap flights, which regularly let people fly for the equivalent of just a few 
dollars, and for some underpin their entire way of life.Liberal aviation restrictions, plus an abundance of airlines 
competing with each other — far more than in the US — resulted in what are often very low prices. With Ryanair, 
outside of peak times, flights across Europe rarely cost more than €100 ($109), and its sales sees flights for as little 
as €9.99, €5, or even €0.01, for flights. "Those markets have grown enormously because many people who couldn't 
afford to travel before have done so whether it is for visiting friends and family going on holiday," Strickland said. 
The result is not only uber-cheap flights, but the knock-on effects of tourism booms and people moving to work all 
over the continent. Among the largest are Irish airline Ryanair and UK airline EasyJet, the biggest and fourth-
biggest airlines in the world respectively by their number of routes. Both are hurting from the crisis — and any 
collapses, or changes to their models, would have huge impacts on the way people fly.The biggest low-cost airlines 
are under immense pressureThe Irish Times reported that Ryanair is now operating fewer than 20 flights a day[6], 
As the coronavirus ravages airlines, Europe's ultra-cheap budget flights could disappear
less than 1% of their usual daily average of 2,500. And EasyJet is not offering any flights. It has grounded its entire 
fleet of planes[7] and is furloughed its 4,000 cabin crew based in the UK.The airline has deferred 24 of the planes it 
had ordered from Airbus,[8] after Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the airline's founder, said the airline would run out of 
money in August unless it scrapped the entire 4.5 billion order for 107 planes, which said were now "useless." The 
companyhas since secured[9] a 600 million loan from the UK Treasury and said it will bring its cash reserves to 2.3 
billion this week. Haji-Ioannou, who is now a major shareholder, had threatened to "personally sue those 
scoundrels"[10]if the company took the loan and still went ahead with the order for 107 planes.Ryanair is among 
Europe's best-placed airlines to ride out the crisisAnalysts have noted that Ryanair has €4 billion of cash on hand 
— enough for 18 months[11]. This makes it one of Europe's best-placed airlines. Strickland said that Ryanair has a 
"phenomenal amount of money" and is "not loaded down with debt" from its plane purchases. He credits this to the 
airline's "aggressive approach" to being low-cost — an approach that made it famous both for one-cent flights sales 
and unpopular money-saving policies like passengers only being able to bring a tiny bag on board without paying 
more. Ryanair at one stage even proposed charging passengers to use the bathroom[12], and has explored 
"standing" seats to it could fit more passengers on planes."Some people look at Ryanair's margins of profitability 
and would think it's excessive," Strickland said. "I've seen so many failures and so much weakness that I defend an 
airline like Ryanair and its need to have that money in the bank." Dr. David Warnock-Smith, an air transport adviser 
and head of aviation at the UK's Buckinghamshire New University, told Business Insider that "only very few, maybe 
a handful of carriers worldwide, have substantial cash reserves." Strickland credited Ryanair's reserves to the way 
that it, like many low-cost airlines "will really negotiate toughly on every cost, particularly airport charges" to bring 
costs to a minimum. And the airline has thrived after previous industry shocks, like the September 11 attacks in 
New York, when it used the opportunity to buy more planes from Boeing. But savings could potentially make it 
harder to get the financial relief that governments are exploring to keep airlines afloat.Warnock-Smith said that 
asking for government support when you have substantial cash reserves is "tricky." "The longer this outbreak goes 
on, the worse it will be for those that have actually made substantial cash reserves. Because there's absolutely no 
chance they will get any support until they are on death's door."The collapse of some airlines could make tickets 
more expensiveThe crisis could result in more expensive flights, or changes to the way flights are run. Andrew 
Charlton, an independent aviation analyst, told Business Insider that reduced economic activity and flight demand 
could cause the collapse of many airlines — potentially creating a landscape in Europe that more closely resembles 
the US. In the US, he said, the top four airlines control more than 80% of the market[13] as of 2018. But in Europe, 
the top four control 40%. "I think what's going to happen is that we get a significantly smaller number of airlines, and 
those airlines will start to behave a little bit more like the airlines in the United States behave. In other words: with 
fewer airlines, fares go up." This would mean fewer airlines to meet demand, so those that remain could decide to, 
or might have to, increase fares. But higher fares could put people off flying when airlines need travellers the most. 
Warnock-Smith said Europe's prices got so cheap because there are so many airlines: "Supply is higher than 
demand, which has led to a surplus of seats, and that's put downward pressure on fares."He said if airlines 
collapse, and then demand for flights picks up again, "we might see higher fares because, because demand will 
outweigh the supply." But he said that would only be likely for a "temporary period." Some European budget airlines 
have already collapsed. UK airline Flybe cited the virus when it collapsed in March[14], and Lufthansa shut its 
budget airline Germanwings[15] in April as it restructured, warning that it will take "years until the worldwide 
demand for air travel returns to pre-crisis levels."And flying could change with airlines that surviveLow-cost airlines 
could end up making changes to some of their unpopular cost-saving policies, or double down on them. In the case 
of Ryanair, Strickland said: "I think the one thing that you can safely guarantee is that they will do whatever they 
think makes them profitable." He said that some carriers could return to the market with a smaller offering of flights, 
even if the reduced offering is temporary. Some airlines might expand to capitalize on weakness in their rivals or 
new openings in the market. Strickland said entire routes could be left up for grabs, pushing airlines into new 
spaces. It could even push some airlines to branch into areas they have never entered, like Ryanair into long-haul 
flights."[Ryanair CEO] Michael O'Leary has time and time again denied that he ever wants to do that. But gosh, if at 
the moment, given how everything else has changed, there's no reason why that might not change as well. We just 
don't know." The most vulnerable airlines could be driven to ultra-low fares to entice travellers, even if that is not 
sustainable, Strickland said. "Some airlines, which frankly have bad business models or bad locations or whatever 
... are going to do stupid things." He said a "fundamental flaw" in aviation economics could occur, whereby "a good, 
successful airline can put a ticket out at a particular price in the market and then an irresponsible, financially 
struggling, bankrupt airline can put out a ridiculous fare." And extended social distancing requirements may mean 
As the coronavirus ravages airlines, Europe's ultra-cheap budget flights could disappear
people have to stay further apart on planes. "If there are going to be those kind of restrictions, what would that 
mean for flights?" Strickland asked."Would that mean that airlines are going to have to fly, let's say half full, or 
always have a middle seat free as you would typically have in a business class?" "That would arguably force you to 
put prices up — but if you put prices up then you get less people going anyway." One Wall Street analyst has 
already recommended that the middle seats of planes be removed[16]. But Warnock-Smith said spacing out 
passengers would be a huge financial risk for airlines.Airlines also have to hope that people will want to flyAirlines 
will need people to actually want to fly — and for countries to want visitors when the outbreak ends. Strickland said 
that Ryanair and EasyJet can typically tempt people with cheap prices during any uncertainty: "They've got so many 
wonderful places. They know people are going to take advantage." "But at the moment there's much wider 
uncertainties: We don't know how much demand there will be." He estimated that demand will be "substantially" 
lower. Reasons may include people having less money being of a wider economic collapse, and lingering fears of 
flying from the pandemic.Warnock-Smith said that people are likely to take fewer non-compulsory trips. "I think 
initially there'll be sort of a lack of confidence and then over time that will pick up again, just like after September the 
11th." Many popular low-cost destinations, like Spain, France, and Italy, are among the worst-hit. "We don't know 
what state these markets will be in," Strickland said, either in wanting visitors or visitors wanting to go there. They 
key could be in keeping the cheap flights that won over customers in the first place. Strickland said that airlines' 
response to other crises, like the September 11 attacks or the 2008 financial crisis, was to set prices that incentivize 
flyers. "I keep using Ryanair as an example, but it's certainly the best one," he said. "They've offered prices at 
almost nothing," he said, "to kickstart the market and get people back to flying." But the question remains as to 
whether Ryanair, or any other airline, will be in a position to do it.NOW WATCH: What it takes to be a first-class

Apr 09, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With multiple countries 
on lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, air-travel demand has been dealt a body blow. To combat this 
unprecedented low-demand scenario, airlines across the globe are cutting capacity.Akin to other carriers across the 
globe, namely United Airlines UAL[1], Gol Linhas GOL[2] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], Allegiant Travel 
Company ALGT) [4]also reduced its schedule for the usually busy summer season. Notably, the companyoperates 
a low-cost passenger airlinethrough its subsidiary Allegiant Air.With cancellations exceeding booking by some 
distance, the company's top line gets stressed. 
In fact, March revenues are likely to have been affected year over year by 40-45%.Due to dwindling demand, the 
company trimmed its March capacity as well, down 12.2% on a year-over-year basis. With demand continuing to

https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/ryanair-holdings-plc-logo.jpgZacks Investment Research[1] downgraded shares 
of Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) from a hold rating to a strong sell rating in a research note published on Tuesday, 
Zacks.com[2] reports. The brokerage currently has $61.00 price target on the transportation company's stock. 
According to Zacks, "Ryanair has been badly hit by the coronavirus outbreak as Italy, one of its main markets, has 
been affected significantly. Owing to the outbreak, shares of the company have declined 37.1% since the beginning 
of February. Due to the coronavirus-led reduced demand the company lowered its fiscal 2020 traffic forecast by 3 
million to 151 million. Notably, Ryanair grounded majority of its flights effective Mar 24 and does not expect to 
operate any flight in April and May. Moreover, below-par performance of the Laudamotion unit is concerning. 
However, efforts to add shareholder value are a positive too. Ryanair returned more than €560 million to its 
shareholders through this investor-friendly measure in fiscal 2019. Ryanair's efforts to expand its fleet size are 
encouraging as well. Moreover, its environment-friendly efforts are commendable."A number of other equities 
research analysts have also commented on RYAAY. Canaccord Genuity reiterated a hold rating on shares of 
Ryanair in a report on Monday. ValuEngine[3] lowered shares of Ryanair from a buy rating to a hold rating in a

strong-buy rating and decreased their price objective for the stock from $108.00 to $65.00 in a report on Monday, 
March 23rd. Two equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have issued a hold rating, 
six have given a buy rating and one has given a strong buy rating to the stock. The company currently has an 
average rating of Hold and a consensus target price of $63.00.Shares of Ryanair stock[4] traded down $1.08 during 
trading on Tuesday, reaching $58.60. The company's stock had a trading volume of 202,713 shares, compared to 
its average volume of 897,474. Ryanair has a 52-week low of $44.44 and a 52-week high of $96.79. The company

quick ratio of 1.07, a current ratio of 1.07 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.64. Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) last 
announced its quarterly earnings data on Monday, February 3rd. The transportation company reported $0.43 
earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, beating the Zacks' consensus estimate of ($0.35) by $0.78. Ryanair had a

Apr 08, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, Latin 
American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[1] reported a massive decline in March traffic and occupancy rate as coronavirus 
persistently paralyzed air-travel demand. Meanwhile, this U.S. based Delta Air Lines DAL[2] expects its second-
quarter 2020 (Apr-Jun) revenues to shrink as much as 90% in the face of plummeting passenger revenues induced 
by the COVID-19 pandemic.Moreover, Alaska Air Group's ALK[3] wholly owned subsidiary Alaska Airlines 
announced further capacity cuts for April and May to combat the extremely bleak air-travel demand scenario. Due 
to the coronavirus-caused turbulence in the airline space, capacity-cut updates [4]were also available in the 
previous week.Across the pond, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] reported a 48% year-over-year 
decline in March traffic to 5.7 million with widespread travel restrictions in place due to the pandemic.Summary of 
the Past Week's Key Headlines1. Due to the coronavirus-led uncertainty, Gol Linhas suspended its guidance for 
2020 and2021. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company announced cost-cutting measures like tax deferrals to 
drive its bottom line in the face of dwindling revenues. Meanwhile, its March consolidated traffic, measured in 
revenue passenger kilometers, declined 29.7%. With Gol Linhas trimming capacity to compensate dwindling 
demand, consolidated capacity (measured in available seat miles) contracted 22.2%.Occupancy rate fell to 71.6% 
[6]from 79.3% in March 2019.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7].2. 
Delta expects its second-quarter 2020 performance to be worse than the first as coronavirus pandemic concerns 
are on the rise. 
Meanwhile, Delta is burning more than $60 million in cash each day but hasn't 'seen the bottom' yet. With crumbling 
air-travel demand, the airline will continue to slash capacity while maintaining a network of only essential services. 
In April, the carrier will reduce capacity by at least 80% with 115,000 flight cancellations. Meanwhile, Delta 
submitted its application for the coronavirus relief grant[8].3. Alaska Airlines plans to lower April and May capacity 
by 80% as the carrier continues to experience more than 80% decline in demand amid the coronavirus crisis. With 
the health hazard continuing unabated, the airline expects to make 'sizeable cuts' in June and beyond as well. 
Previously, Alaska Airlines was expected to lower capacity for April and May by 70%.To cope with this deep crisis, 
the carrier took several cost-reduction initiatives[9].4 American Airlines AAL[10] aims to cancel more flights to and 
from New York City area airports due to 'rapidly evaporating" travel demand as COVID-19 cases increase in the 
region. Notably, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an advisory warning against all non-

essential travel to and from New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. American Airlines will now operate only 13 
daily flights[11] from New York's JFK and LaGuardia airports and New Jersey's Newark airport between Apr 9 and 
May 6.5. As a result of the coronavirus-triggered difficulty, Ryanair expects its fiscal 2020 Profit After Tax in the 
€950-€1,000 million band(which is at the lower end of the earlier guided range). The company will release its fiscal 
2020 results on May 18. With flights mainly operating for emergency purposes, Ryanair currently runs less than 20 
flights a day, reflecting an enormous 99% reduction[12] from the 2,500 plus flights that took to the skies daily prior 
to the COVID-19 outbreak.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players 
over the past week and during the past six months.The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in 
the red over the past week, inducing a 5.8% decline in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to $42.63. This downtrend 
was due to the coronavirus-induced fast-vanishing air-travel demand. Over the course of past six months, the 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index has tanked 56.7%.Free: Zacks' Single Best Stock Set to DoubleToday you are invited to

Apr 07, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate 
ReleaseChicago, IL - April 7, 2020 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day 
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. 
Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Delta Air Lines DAL[1], American Airlines AAL[2], Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[3], Avianca Holdings AVH[4] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[5].Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog: 
Coronavirus Ravages Air Travel: Traffic Sinks to 2-Decade LowWith the coronavirus pandemic wrecking air-travel 
demand, the not-so-long-ago high-flying airlines have been brought to their knees across the globe. This is because 
passenger revenues, the largest component of their top line, took a gigantic hit from shriveled air-travel 
demand.Due to the spread of the coronavirus by geometric progression, blanket travel bans are imposed by 
governments across the globe. 
With several countries placed under lockdown, most people are debarred from taking trips in a bid to stay safe and 
avoid contracting the highly contagious disease from a fellow passenger.IATA's February Traffic Report: Reflection 
of a Sorry StatePer the International Air Transport Association (IATA), passenger traffic across the globe in 
February registered the steepest year-over-year decline in two decades. Notably, demand (measured in total 
revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) dropped 14.1% in the month on a year-over-year basis, signaling the 
sharpest monthly decrease since the dreaded 9/11 terror attacks on the United States back in 2001.With carriers 
across the globe cutting capacity to compensate the extremely low-demand scenario, overall capacity (available 
seat kilometers or ASKs) fell 8.7% in the second month of this year. With traffic decreasing at a faster rate than 
capacity reduction in the month, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) contracted 4.8 percentage points to 
75.9%.In international passenger markets, demand deteriorated 10.1% in February on a year-over-year basis. With 
respect to international passenger demand, the level hit the nadir since the SARS outbreak in 2003. Demand for 
domestic travel dwindled 20.9% in the month mainly due to weakness in China's domestic traffic. This was because 
in February, China bore the worst brunt of the deadly coronavirus disease.Traffic Picture Likely to be Bleaker 
AheadWe expect the global traffic performance to have touched rock bottom in March given that the COVID-19 
outbreak was declared a pandemic by WHO in the month. With air-travel demand collapsing, the 
ZacksAirline[6]industry plummeted 52.4% in March.In fact, with the health hazard showing no signs of waning, air-
travel demand is likely to remain stressed atleast in the near term. Anticipating such a gloomy scene going forward, 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Delta Air Lines , American Airlines , Ryanair , Avianca and JetBlue Airways
the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Delta Air Lines warned that revenues in second-quarter 2020 (Apr-Jun period) are likely 
to be down 90% year over year. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks 
here[7].Other U.S.-based carriers like American Airlines cancelled most of their flights due to the shrinkage in air-
travel demand as the pandemic continues to spread its tentacles across the globe, claiming multiple lives and 
infecting the global populace at large. The situation is exemplified by the European carrier Ryanair Holdings' 
anticipation that its fleet will remain mostly grounded through at least April and May. To combat the coronavirus-
induced 
threat, 
Latin 
American 
carriers 
like 
Avianca 
Holdings 
temporarily 
closed 
all 
passenger 
operations.ConclusionIATA's Director General and CEO Alexandre de Juniac rightly termed the current impasse as 
the 'biggest crisis that the industry has ever faced'. Due to the widespread flight cancellations, IATA projected 
airlines to burn up to $61 billion of their cash reserves during the second quarter of 2020.Passenger demand is 
likely to plunge71% in the Apr-Jun period. In fact, due to this suppressed demand, IATA anticipates airline 
passenger revenues, the largest component of their top line, to be dented by $252 billion in 2020.In fact, per OAG, 
provider of airline data and insight, airlines may have to wait until 2022 or 2023 to attract passengers at the level 
initially expected for the current year. Notably, JetBlue Airways' CEO Robin Hayes had warned last month that "the 
writing is on the wall" that travel demand cannot be restored anytime soon. Come what may, we expect investor 
focus to remain on this topical issue. To this end, we advise industry watchers to watch this space for more updates 
on the coronavirus overhang on air-travel and the airline industry's response to this standoff.Breakout Biotech 
Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as

Apr 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With the coronavirus 
pandemic crippling air-travel demand, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported a 48% year-
over-year decline in March traffic to 5.7 million guests. Additionally, in view of the widespread travel restrictions in 
place due to the outbreak, Ryanair's traffic for fiscal 2020 (ended Mar 31, 2020) improved a mere 4% year over 
year to 149 million. Notably, the carrier was on track to achieve traffic of 154 million even as late as in early 
March.As a result of this adversity, Ryanair expects fiscal 2020 Profit After Tax in the €950 million-€1,000 million 
range (which is at the lower end of the earlier expected range). The company will release its fiscal 2020 results on 
May 18. The carrier expects to record an exceptional charge of €300 million in its fiscal 2020 results.With flights 
mainly operating for rescue and medical purposes, Ryanair currently runs less than 20 flights per day, representing 
a massive 99% reduction from the 2,500 plus flights that took to the skies daily prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.With 
the situation showing no signs of subsiding, Ryanair anticipates its fleet to remain mostly grounded through at least 
April and May. 
With revenues being severely hit, Ryanair undertook several cost-cutting measures to drive its bottom line. The 
same includes deferring capital expenditures, freezing recruitment, trimming pay for April and May by half and 
pushing back discretionary spending. Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier suspended share buybacks. Due to 
the coronavirus-led crisis, shares of Ryanair have dropped 29.7% in the past month.You can seethe complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[2].The coronavirus outbreak has not only affected Ryanair's 
operations but also other airlines across the globe. With demand collapsing exponentially, carriers are trimming 
their capacity levels drastically. Evidently, the Chicago-based United Airlines UAL[3] slashed its April capacity by 
60% with further cuts anticipated in May and June.Notably, the chaos brought about by this pandemic hit other 
corners of the Zacks Transportation [4]sector as well. Recently, major railroad operators, namely Union Pacific 
Corporation UNP[5] and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC[6] warned that the pandemic could have a material 
adverse impact on their results.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special 
Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this 
industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to

Mar 25, 2020( Joanne Jacobs: http://www.joannejacobs.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Can you imagine getting to 
study abroad somewhere as exotic as Morocco, and then getting stuck there[1] due to coronavirus? Danford, an 
American student from the University of Vermont in Burlington, was less than two weeks into what was supposed to 
be over a month of education and cultural immersion in Moroccan life. 
'We went from thinking we might stay there for the whole semester to leaving as soon as possible,' she told ABC 
News Following the announcement on Sunday, March 15, Danford said the next four days were a blur of finding 
any option for her and at least 27 classmates to get home — all of whom were enrolled in a study abroad program 
focused on climate change through the School of International Training[2] Jaime Molyneux, the director of 
international risk management at UPenn, chartered a private plane for eight students — including Chia — from 
Casablanca Mohammed V International Airport to London Luton Airport on March 19. From there, the students took 
ground transportation to London Heathrow Airport and booked commercial flights to their final destinations. 
According to Molyneux, the university was able to cover costs of the private flight with an emergency fund 'What 
ended up getting us out were connections and money and institutions,' she said. 'I really feel like institutions were 
so much more powerful than the U.S. government.' Danford echoed those sentiments, telling ABC News that she 
and 23 of her peers secured seats on a Ryanair flight, which had been chartered for European citizens, also on 
March 19. They found out about the flight through a travel agent that a student's parents knew Putting aside the 
risks associated with the Ryanair flight, Stahelin commended the group for taking initiative. 'I admire how some 
students decided to take matters into their own hands and be very resourceful, self-organize and get themselves 
out,' he said. Before they had a definitive way home, both Danford and Chia contacted their respective senators 
and representatives, asking their family and friends to do the same.What an adventure those students will have to 
tell their children and grandchildren about! [ 1]: https://abcnews.go.com/Health/american-study-abroad-students-

Mar 24, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair has said it expects that 
most of its flights will be grounded from today amid the coronavirus crisis. 'The experience in China suggests a 
three-month period for the spread of the virus to be contained and reduced. We do not expect to operate flights 
during the months of April and May at this time, but this will clearly depend on government advice', the company 
tweeted. Ryanair also said that it has offered its planes to all EU governments, for rescue flights, as well as for the 
movement of vital medicines, personal protective equipment and emergency food supplies. It stressed that the 
planes used for the purpose will be disinfected on a daily basis. The airline said that the passengers whose flights 
have been cancelled will receive an email 'over the next week or two' outlining their options, and asked passengers 
'to be patient and bear with us'. Ryanair's CEO Micheal O'Leary reminded that, like all pandemics, this crisis will 
pass: 'In Ryanair, Buzz, Lauda and Air Malta, we will do everything we can to keep our aircraft, our crews and our 
engineering teams operational so that when Europe defeats this Covid-19 pandemic, we are ready to return to 
flying', O'Leary said.

unfolding at the UK border. As the country braces for a wave of COVID-19 cases, people are scratching their heads 
and wondering why flights from Italy, China, and Iran are still flowing in. Keep in mind, the UK does not have the 
greatest healthcare system - at all.MORE NEWS: CNN Reporter 'This is About as Pissed Off as I've Ever Seen 
McConnell'[1] Thousands of passengers from Italy, China and Iran arrived in Britain this week. 
Reports indicate that flights from Rome, Beijing, and Shanghai have landed in London every single day leading up 
the Coronavirus outbreak.Flights carrying thousands of passengers from the worst-hit coronavirus areas are still 
landing in Britain. Passengers fromItaly,ChinaandIranhave arrived a Gatwick and Heathrow this week, even as the 
UK went in to lockdown, shutting bars, cafes, restaurants and banning mass gatherings. Planes have arrived in 
London from Rome, Beijing and Shanghai every day this week. Direct flights from Rome are also still due to arrive 
next week.The route between London and Rome has remained open despiteBritish Airways, easyJet and Ryanair 
cancelling all flights between Italy and Britain. Iran Air is still operating three flights a week from the capital Tehran 
and in the last seven days three Iranian aircraft landed at Heathrow. Iranhas the third-highest coronavirus death toll 
with more than 1,500 fatalities. On Saturday two Air China flights from Beijing and a China Eastern jet from 
Shanghai landed at Heathrow, while a flight from Shanghai arrived at Gatwick. This afternoon, a flight from Imam 
Khomeini International Airport in Tehran, is due to arrive at Heatrow Airport at around 3pm this afternoon.[Daily 
Mail[2]]Travelers arriving from China, Iran, and Italy with 'symptoms' of COVID-19 are supposed to be stopped from 
boarding - and upon arrival in the UK, passengers from these countries are supposed self-isolate for 14 days, but 
there's no way of enforcing this policy. MORE NEWS: Report: Senate Dems Block Republican Efforts To Ease

Mar 23, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of American 
Airlines AAL[1] have lost 59.2% compared with the industry[2]'s 56% decline in the past month.American Airlines, 
like most other airline stocks, has been hit hard by the sharp drop in air-travel demand due to the coronavirus 
outbreak,which eventually dented its stock's prospects.Coronavirus-Led Woes Stunt American Airlines' GrowthDue 
to the coronavirus-induced steep plunge in demand, American Airlines aims to cut international flights by 75% and 
domestic flights by 30% in April. In response to the extremely low-demand scenario, this Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold) Fort 
Worth, TX-based carrier suspended all its long-haul international flightsapart from the ones flyingto London 
Heathrow and Tokyo. The carrier trimmedits April schedule by more than 55,000 flights and decided to park 
approximately 130 widebody and 320 narrowbody planes. 
Further reductions are planned for May.With revenues being hurt due to extremely low passenger traffic, American 
Airlines is looking to cut costs to drive the bottom line. Evidently, the carrier halted its hiring process apart from 
offering pay-freeze options. Moreover, the carrier decided to temporarily discontinue itsnew hire flight attendant 
classes.In view of the massive slump in passenger revenues due to weak demand, it is natural that American 
Airlines' financial position is being stressed. To bolster its liquidity position, the carrier recently secured a $1-billion

Mar 20, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Delta Air 
Lines DAL[1] have lost 63.2% compared with the industry[2]'s 59.8% decline in the past month. Delta, like most 
other airline stocks, has been hit hard by the sharp drop in air-travel demand due to the coronavirus outbreak, 
resulting in the stock's depreciation.Coronavirus-Led Woes Dampen Delta's ProspectsDue to the coronavirus-
induced sharp plunge in demand, Delta expects revenues for March to be almost $2 billion less on a year-over-year 
basis. The carrier's projection for April is worse. 
In a bid to match the extremely low-demand scenario, this Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold) Atlanta-GA based carrier decided 
to cut systemwide capacity to the tune of 70% until there is a recovery in air-travel demand. Notably, over the next 
two to three months, Delta's international flights will be reduced to more than 80%.You cansee the complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[3]With revenues being dented due to extremely low passenger 
traffic, Delta is looking to cut costs to drive the bottom line. Evidently, the carrier deferred all plans pertaining to 
capital spending. Moreover, the carrier put a pause on hiring and is offering voluntary leave options to employees. 
Apart from accelerating retirement plans of the older planes in its fleet, Delta aims to downsize its active fleet by 
parking at least 50% of the fleetDue to the above-mentioned downsides following the coronavirus outbreak, Fitch 
Ratings lowered its outlook for Delta to negative.Delta apart, carriers like American Airlines AAL[4], JetBlue Airways 
JBLU[5] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] cut capacity in the face of dwindling demand due to this health

Mar 18, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We recently issued an 
updated report on Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. HTZ[1]. Factors like high-debt levels, weakness in the International 
Rental Car segment and coronavirus-related woes hurt the company's financials. However, efficient fleet 
management and improved services are positives.Hertz Global is benefiting from strong performance in the U.S. 
Rental Car segment. Revenues in the segment increased 7.1% in 2019. Efficient fleet management and improved 
services are driving growth in this key unit.The company's cost-control initiatives are also impressing. With slower 
rise in operating, selling, and administrative expenses, the company has been able to keep costs in check.Hertz

Hertz Global Holdings, Inc price[2] | Hertz Global Holdings, Inc Quote[3]However, the company's International 
Rental Car segment delivered below-par performance in 2019. The unit generated revenues of $2,169 million in the 
period, down 4.7% year over year. 
Sluggishness in the European market is affecting the unit's performance and is expected to impact the overall 
performance going forward. Moreover, coronavirus-induced low demand for car rentals may hurt the company 
going forward.Moreover, Hertz Global's debt to capitalization ratio, a measure of financial leverage, stood at 90.9 
compared with the industry [4]'s average of 49.4. A high debt-to-equity ratio implies that the company is funding 
most of its ventures with borrowings. Also, the company's negative adjusted free cash flow ($202 million) in 2019 
raises concerns.Zacks Rank & Stocks to considerHertz Global carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Few better-ranked

Mar 18, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Southwest 
Airlines Co. LUV[1] have lost 24.6% compared with the industry's 44.2% decline in a years' time. The disappointing 
performance was primarily caused by the coronavirus-induced low air traffic demand apart from the prolonged 
grounding of the 34 Boeing 737 MAX jets in its fleet.Let's take a detailed look into the factors hurting the 
stock.Southwest Airlines witnessed a sharp fall in passenger bookings due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
The carrier recently issued a bearish view on revenue per available seat miles (RASM: a key measure of unit 
revenues) for first-quarter 2020. The company now anticipates first-quarter TRASM to either dip 2% or inch up to 
1% from the year-ago quarter's figure.Moreover, drop in traffic demand is expected to persist for the rest of March, 
given the rapid spread of COVID-19. Consequently, first-quarter operating revenues are expected to decline $200-
$300 million. To tackle the low-demand scenario, the carrier aims to reduce capacity by a minimum 20% in the Apr 
14-Jun 5 period. Since the carrier has 34 Boeing 737 MAX jets in its fleet, prolonged grounding since March 2019 is 
significantly hurting the company. Apart from incurring high non-fuel unit costs, the carrier's operating income was 
hurt to the tune of $828 million in 2019. Also, Southwest Airlines expects the jets to remain grounded through early 
August 2020.Zacks Rank & Stocks to considerSouthwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Few better-
ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation [2]sector are GATX Corporation GATX[3], Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[4] and Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE[5]. GATX sports a Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy), whereas Ryanair and 
Spirit Airlines carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks

Editor's note: Revised Mar 13 2330 UTC to update total COVID-19 cases and cases in neighboring countries. The 
tiny Balkan state of Montenegro is the only country in Europe without a confirmed case of the novel coronavirus that 
has swept across the globe and infected over 125,000 people. Forty-four other European countries have confirmed 
COVID-19 cases, and Europe is home to 6 of the top 10 most infected countries outside China, and 12 of the top 16 
outside China. 
Exactly how Montenegro, which has a population of 628,066, has stayed coronavirus-free is not known. The 
country is bordered by five other Balkan states, all of which have confirmed the virus: Bosnia and Herzegovina (24 
cases), Serbia (48), Croatia (49), Kosovo (2), and Albania (42). What's more, Montenegro is only about 350 miles 
away from Italy, which now has the second most COVID-19 infections in the world (17,660 cases), behind only 
China.  Nations in Europe reporting cases of COVID-19 (as of Mar 13) represented in RED.According to Al 
Jazeera[1], Montenegro has close ties to its neighbor across the Adriatic, as thousands of Balkan people reside in 
Italy and frequently travel to the country.However, when the virus began to spread in China and later in Italy, 
Montenegro took steps to restrict travel. In early February, Montenegro indefinitely 'suspended all tourist 
arrangements with China[2],' according to Al Jazeera. Then in late February, the country banned flights operated by 
Ryanair and WizzAir to and from Northern Italy[3], SimplyFlying.com reported. And while it appears the bans may 
have helped prevent coronavirus spread so far, the risk of coronavirus infections in Montenegro is 'high,' the 
country's government said on Mar 3[4]. 'The widespread local transmission of the virus in Italy, with which 
Montenegro has cultural and transport links, as well as the growing number of affected provinces and areas, [imply] 
a high certainty that further local spread of the infection in Italy will continue ,' said health minister Kenan 
Hrapović[5], who noted the spread of infections originating in Italy. 'Their increase, as well as the number of 
countries outside China reporting cases of infection with the novel coronavirus, represent possible, that is, potential 
sources of infection for the population of Montenegro.'According to a Mar 6 article from Balkan Insight, 34 people in 
Montenegro[6] 
were 
under 
surveillance 
for 
COVID-19, 
but 
no 
infections 
were 
announced.

Mar 17, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We recently issued an 
updated report on Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC[1]. Factors like low volumes, high-debt levels and 
coronavirus-related woes have hurt the company's financials. However, its shareholder-friendly approach bodes 
well.Norfolk Southern is constantly undertaking efforts to streamline operations by curbing costs. The company's 
operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in 2019 increased to 64.7% from 65.4% a year 
ago. Notably, lower value of the metric bodes well. Further, the company aims to achieve an operating ratio of 60% 
in 2021. Moreover, its new precision scheduled railroading operating plan, TOP21, aims to enhance efficiency and 
customer service.Moreover, the company's efforts to reward its investors through share buybacks and dividend 
payments are commendable. In 2019, the company returned $3,048 million to its shareholders through dividend 
payouts ($949 million) and buybacks ($2,099 million). Notably, Norfolk Southern has hiked its quarterly dividend 
payout 
four 
times 
since 
2018.Norfolk

https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/NSC/price?icid=chart-NSC-fundamental/price Norfolk Southern Corporation 
price[2] | Norfolk Southern Corporation Quote[3]However, automotive volumes declined 2% in 2019 due to 
decelerating vehicle production in the United States. 
Key components in the merchandise segment like forest and consumer (volumes down 7% in 2019) as well as 
metals and construction (volumes down 5% in 2019) performed dismally.Apart from the merchandise segment, key 
units like coal and intermodal put up a poor show due to below-par rail traffic volumes. In 2019, intermodal volumes 
at Norfolk Southern declined 4%, while coal volumes shrank 12%. Due to the sluggish performance of its key 
divisions, overall volumes declined 5% in 2019. Due to the lackluster freight scenario, first-quarter 2020 revenues 
are expected to be similar to what was achieved in fourth-quarter 2019.Moreover, the company's high-debt levels 
are concerns. Also, the coronavirus outbreak is a setback for the company and might delay shipments. The same is 
likely to hurt first-quarter 2020 results.Zacks Rank & Stocks to considerNorfolk Southern carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold).Few better-ranked stocks to consider in the zacks Transportation[4] sector are GATX Corporation GATX[5], 
Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[6] and Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE[7]. GATX sports a Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy),

Mar 17, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate 
ReleaseChicago, IL - March 17, 2020 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every 
day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial 
markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1], Air France KLM AFLYY[2], Delta 
Air Lines DAL[3], American Airlines AAL[4] and Southwest Airlines LUV[5].Here are highlights from Monday's 
Analyst Blog: Airlines Brought to Their Knees by Coronavirus: What's Ahead?The dreaded coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on Mar 11, has been a nightmare 
for stocks, keeping investors on the edge.Due to his health hazard, which has claimed multiple lives apart from 
infecting many more across the globe, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and the Dow Jones plunged to their historic lows on 
Mar 12, resulting in the end of the 11-year bull run.Due to coronavirus woes, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and the Dow 
Jones have tanked 16.1%, 12.2% and 18.8%, respectively, so far this year, paring last year's impressive 
gains.Jolted Airlines Take Actions to Meet Dwindling DemandEven though coronavirus-related fears have rattled 
most sectors, travel-focused stocks, which include airlines, have borne the brunt of the outbreak. 
Evidently, the ZacksAirline[6]industry has shed 35.9% of its value since the commencement of February compared 
with the S&P 500 index's loss of 15.9% in the same time frame.With international travel demand dwindling due to 
the rapid spread of this highly infectious disease, airline stocks are getting clobbered. With the disease spreading to 
countries like Italy, South Korea, Iran, the United States and Germany, many people are unwilling to fly to stay safe 
and avoid contracting the disease from a fellow passenger.In a bid to fight coronavirus-led low demand for air-
travel, airlines from all corners of the globe are trimming their capacity. With Italy suffering the most due to COVID-
19 in Europe, European carrier Ryanair Holdings, sporting a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy), lowered its 2020 traffic forecast 
by 3 million to 151 million. Also, Air France KLM suspended all its flights to/from Italy from Mar 14 through Apr 
3.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[7]Airline companies based in 
the United States too have resorted to various measures for tackling the coronavirus-led sharp drop in demand. 
Evidently, Delta Air Lines will slash overall capacity by 40% in the next few months, the highest in its history, 
including 2001, as air travel demand sees a rapid fall and revenues take a hit. Moreover, American Airlines aims to 
cut international flights by 75% to match the extremely-low demand scenario.Also, to combat the drop in demand, 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Ryanair , Air France KLM, Delta Air Lines , American Airlines and 
Southwest Airlines
airlines are reducing capital expenses, discretionary operating costs as well as suspending share buybacks.More 
Turbulence Down the Road?Even though the 30-day ban on travel to the United States from 26[8] European 
countries announced last week by President Trump (expanded subsequently to include UK and Ireland) is aimed at 
preventing further spread of the disease, the development implies a further setback to the already beleaguered 
airline stocks. Moreover, a ban on domestic air travel is also being reportedly[9] considered to prevent the 
spread.With demand fast-disappearing and the scenario unlikely to improve at least in the near term, first-quarter 
earnings are likely to be hurt severely by this pandemic. For instance, United Airlines, which has already withdrawn 
its guidance for first-quarter 2020 and the full year as well, expects March revenues to be $1.5 billion lower than 
March 2019. Also, Southwest Airlines recently issued a bearish unit revenue guidance for the March quarter due to 
coronavirus-led low demand. First-quarter operating revenues are expected to decline between $200 and $300 
million.Moreover, the International Air Transport Association currently expects airline passenger revenues for 2020 
to be hurt in the $63-$113 billion band.ConclusionThe above write-up indicates in no uncertain terms that the airline 
industry, which even before the coronavirus outbreak was suffering from issues like prolonged grounding of Boeing 
737 MAX jets, has been dealt a body-blow. What is more alarming is that the situation is likely to get worse at least 
in the near term. With the adversity showing no signs of abating, revenues in the upcoming summer season, usually 
considered to be the busiest time for U.S. airlines, are likely to be hit badly.In a bid to help U.S. airlines combat this 
unprecedented crisis, the U.S. administration is considering[10] financial help to airlines. Watch this space for 
further updates on the coronavirus and its resultant impact on the airline industry.Today's Best Stocks from

Mar 17, 2020( Cantech Letter: http://www.cantechletter.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The calamity faced by airlines 
worldwide after the 9-11 terrorist attacks could be just a blip on the radar compared to today's coronavirus crisis, 
says aviation expert Pilar Wolfsteller of Flightglobal, who says a number of carriers will be facing stiff challenges as 
the pandemic continues across the globe.Major airlines worldwide issued a joint open letter on Monday asking 
governments to support their carriers in their time of need, as nations close borders and restrict both domestic and 
international travel in aid of slowing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. 'The unprecedented circumstances triggered 
by the coronavirus outbreak pose an existential threat not only to the airline industry but more generally to global 
trade and commerce, and social connectivity,' said Jeffrey Goh, chief executive of Star Alliance[1], one of three 
airline groups including SkyTeam and oneworld which published the letter. 'As airlines stretch their limits to manage 
the crisis, it is equally critical for governments and stakeholders to avoid further burdens and step up with 
measures, as some have, that will ensure the future of the travel industry.'The news comes as major carriers have 
announced drastic cuts to service in recent days. 
 American Airlines (American Airlines Stock Quote, Chart, News Nasdaq:AAL[2]) on Saturday said it will be 
shuttering 75 per cent of its international service up until May 6 and grounding most of its widebody fleet, with 
British Airways announcing a similar 75 per cent reduction.  Ryanair, Europe's largest carrier, announced a 
reduction of seat capacity by 80 per cent. 'It's going to be a devastating blow to many of the carriers,' said 
Wolfsteller, speaking to CNBC on Monday. 'We've got a number of the majors in the United States announcing 40 
per cent, 50 per cent, 75 per cent in their international service.' 'Then we also have local carriers such as Spirit and 
Frontier that primarily have regional networks here in the United States that are going to be running into a lot of 
trouble because their cash flow isn't that great,' she said. 'So we have a whole bunch of problems running from the 
regionals all the way up to the international carriers and we're going to be facing a pretty long-term crisis in the 
aviation industry.' Perhaps more dire, the International Air Transport Association, which represents almost 300 
airlines, said that the pandemic could cut revenues by US113 billion in 2020 alone and the Centre for Aviation 
claimed that the coronavirus will bankrupt most of the world's airlines by the end of May unless governments and 
the industry work together to address the crisis.Wolfsteller says not knowing how long the pandemic will go on puts 
the current crisis in a different category compared to the disruption seen in the airlines industry following the 
September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. 'It's an open-ended question at the moment,' Wolfsteller 
said. 'After 911, airspace closed for about four or five days before air travel slowly got back to normal, and experts 
Aviation industry set for 'long-term crisis', expert says
and industry analysts are starting to say, 'We don't even know if this is going to be worse than 911.'' 'Just looking at 
the demand drop-off over the last couple of weeks, we really don't know where the bottom is on this,' she said.

Mar 16, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Ryanair 
Holdings RYAAY[1] have lost 27.5% compared with the industry[2]'s 39.2% decline in the past month. Ryanair, like 
most other airline stocks, has been hit hard by the sharp drop in air-travel demand due to the coronavirus outbreak, 
resulting in the decline of the stock.Coronavirus-Led Woes in Italy Dwarf RyanairRyanair's primary market is Italy, 
which is now the worst-hit European country. Consequently, demand from this key market has dropped 
significantly. 
As a result, Ryanair, which had earlier decided to trim its capacity to/from Italy by 25% from Mar 17 to Apr 8, 
announced that it intends to suspend more domestic and international Italian flights through Apr 8.With demand 
anticipated to decline further, traffic and load factor are likely be 'lower than normal' in March and April. For April 
and May, Ryanair aims to trim capacity by up to 80%. In fact, the company aims to ground most of its aircraft in 
Europe over the next seven to 10 daysRyanair's CEO Michael O'Leary warned of a "meaningful impact" of the virus 
on fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 (ending Mar 31, 2020) results. Notably, due to low demand, Ryanair lowered its fiscal 
2020 traffic forecast by 3 million to 151 million.Ryanair is not the only carrier to have trimmed its capacity due to the 
viral outbreak. U.S.-based carriers including American Airlines AAL[3], United Airlines UAL[4] and Delta Air Lines 
DAL[5] also suspended various flights in the wake of the coronavirus onslaught.Buying Opportunity?However, many 
investors may view the sharp drop in Ryanair's stockprice as an opportunity to build position on the stock mainly 
due to its strong fundamentals. Additionally, the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings 
has been revised 4.3% upward over the past 60 days signifies that analysts have not lost confidence in the Ryanair 
stock.Also, its Momentum Score[6] of B highlights the stock's short-term attractiveness. Additionally, Ryanair carries 
a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/europes-biggest-customers-are-now-gone-what-next/Europe is one of the 
world's richest continents. The European Union with its 28 members and 500 million residents is considered as the 
global superpower, a well-sophisticated market with good education, healthcare, and financial industries.It attracts 
tens of billions in investments every year and is home to some of the biggest financial centers globally. 
London, Paris, and Zurich are hubs of immense significance for the rest of the world. Besides being a global 
economic powerhouse in finance, Europe also is home to some of the most visited countries on earth. France is the 
number one on the list globally while Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, and others are also included. In the 
meantime, the British capital of London is the most visited city in the world. With such scales, Europe accounts for a 
big part of international and domestic flights. Continent's ultra-low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Wizzair further 
contribute to high mobility across European nations. However, the majority of spendings in the EU is made by 
overseas visitors. More particularly, amid the rapid development of Asian economies, China has become one of the 
biggest customers of the EU services. As of 2016, over 25 million visits were made by Chinese visitors within the 
EU[1]. Besides the already high yet ever-increasing number, they also are big spenders. For comparison, tourists 
from other European nations do not spend nearly as much as those from China. Moreover, the majority of flight 
operators from China into the EU are European. This is particularly important as aviation is a major branch of the 
economy for the European Union.COVID-19: what EU industries does it affect and how exactlyDependency on 
Chinese investments and visitors is having devastating consequences for Europe amid the global novel coronavirus 
outbreak. Originating in China, the new type of coronavirus has already spread across the west, including Europe. 
There are now more than 10,000 cases of the virus in Italy while others like Spain, France, and Germany are also 
witnessing a soaring trend. Direct services were soon suspended from China as the nation's Hubei province went 
into a strict lockdown. The further spread of the virus led to a drop in international travel as an increasing number of 
industries warn about the potential major crisis. So which fields are most affected?Entertainment and gamblingThe 
entertainment industry is one of the most affected ones. Leisure venues all across Europe are facing the lack of 
visitors and some are fearing closure due to the current circumstances. The gambling industry is struggling as well. 
Casinos are widespread in European countries and some areas, like Monaco, are highly dependent on revenues 
generated by gambling venues. Physical casinos come with higher risks due to bodily contacts among staff 
members and visitors. In the meantime, online gambling platforms are taking their chances to substitute famous 
Europe's biggest customers are now gone - what next?
European venues amid the crisis. Bonus offers are being widely promoted on the web to attract more people to 
such platforms. Playamo casino is one of the most popular ones that is visited by a soaring number of people each 
day. Their Playamo casino bonus offer[2] is very popular among players online. Some of those who have used it 
say that the variety of options and possibilities on such platforms is often more attractive than bonuses themselves. 
Online casinos are actively trying to maintain the growth and the current crisis seems to be beneficial for 
them.AirlinesCarriers all around the world were forced to cancel thousands of flights[3] while some services had to 
be completely suspended amid the COVID-19 spread into Europe. At first, flights were stopped from China, a major 
hit for the industry. Airlines such as British and KLM used to operate tens of flights daily between Chinese cities and 
their European hubs. Norwegian Air recently announced that they would cancel 3,000 flights or roughly 15% of their 
entire capacity in the coming months. British Airways always stopped all flights to and out of Italy shortly followed by 
popular low-cost Ryanair. The crisis is also affecting the domestic market as the demand for travel shrinks 
dramatically. American Airlines became one of the first US carriers to reduce domestic capacity in response to the 
outbreak. Moreover, airports across Europe are already reporting plummeting passenger traffic as airlines are 
operating almost-empty ghost flights. London Heathrow, Europe's largest and one of the world's busiest airports 
reported a 5% decrease in passenger numbers[4] this February and March.Accommodation: hotels under a major 
threatRevenue of hotels and other means of accommodation are directly connected to tourism and travel industries. 
As international mobility decreases in spite of the novel coronavirus outbreak, hotels all across Europe are facing 
closures and cancellations. Short-time online rental platforms, such as AIRBNB also reported plunging booking 
rates in February and early March. The issue is particularly visible in Italy, one of Europe's biggest tourism hotspots, 
which now sits under a nation-wide lockdown. Almost no hotels operate in Northern while the media is reporting 
pictures of empty streets in Venice and Milano. Read more: Europe's biggest customers are now gone - what

Mar 16, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Delta Air Lines, Inc. 
DAL[1] will be slashing overall capacity by 40% in the next few months, the highest in its history, including 2001, as 
air travel demand sees a rapid fall and revenues take a hit amid the fast-evolving coronavirus outbreak. The airline 
is witnessing a significant increase in cancellations, with net bookings for travel being negative over the next four 
weeks. 
In fact, the carrier is seeing more ticket cancellations than bookings over the next month.Per the company's CEO 
Ed Bastian, 'the speed of the demand fall-off is unlike anything we've seen - and we've seen a lot in our business. 
We are moving quickly to preserve cash and protect our company. And with revenues dropping, we must be 
focused on taking costs out of our business.'With government travel restrictions, Delta will not be flying to 
continental Europe for the next 30 days. This halt could further be extended if needed. However, the airline will 
continue service to London. With significant reduction in capacity, the carrier will be grounding up to 300 aircraft. In 
response to the lower capacity, the company is also delaying new aircraft deliveries, which in turn would help in 
preserving cash. To further cut costs, Delta plans to reduce capital expenditures by a minimum of $2 billion this 
year. The carrier has also started offering voluntary short-term unpaid leaves, apart from freezing hiring. The 
Atlanta-GA based airline has also substantially reduced the use of consultants and contractors.Bastian expects the 
downturn to get worse in the future. Keeping in mind this deep crisis, he is foregoing his salary for the next six 
months.Due to the coronavirus-led demand slowdown, shares of Delta have declined 23.2% since the beginning of 
February.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDelta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the 
broader Transportation[2] sector are Azul AZUL[3], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] and GATX Corporation GATX[5]. 
While Azul and GATX sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see

Mar 16, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  United Airlines Holdings 
UAL[1] has provided an update on how deeply coronavirus is impacting its business, as the health crisis intensifies 
across the globe, including the United States, forcing the state and local governments to shut down schools and 
restricting people to their homes. Amid this turmoil, President Donald Trump announced fresh travel restrictions to 
the United Kingdom and Ireland over the last weekend.With a significant decline in travel demand as hesitant 
customers are avoiding air travel and following large-scale travel restrictions, the carrier transported more than one 
million fewer customers in just the first two weeks of March compared with the year-ago period, especially given 
that March is usually its busiest time of the year. As a result, the Chicago, IL-based airline expects March revenues 
to be down $1.5 billion year over year. 
In fact, the carrier anticipates the number of customers and revenues to decline sharply going forward.To mitigate 
the effects of the adversities, United Airlines is planning to reduce payroll expenses. To this end, the company will 
be slashing corporate officers' salaries by 50%. Additionally, the airline will cut back capacity for April and May by 
50%. The capacity reductions are expected to extend into the summer travel period. Despite the significant 
reduction in capacity, the airline expects load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) to fall in the 20-30% 
range, assuming things to worsen in the future.In addition to significant schedule reductions, the airline previously 
took measures such as freezing hiring (except for crucial roles), delaying 2019 merit salary increases, and giving 
employees the option to apply for voluntary, unpaid leave of absence to counteract the demand slump.Due to 
setback from coronavirus-induced low demand, shares of United Airlines have plunged 52.4% since the beginning 
of February compared with the industry[2]'s 37.7% decline.Zacks Rank & Key PicksUnited Airlines currently carries 
a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation[3] sector are Azul AZUL[4], 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] and GATX Corporation GATX[6]. While Azul and GATX sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy), Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks 
here[7].Each of the stocks has an impressive earnings history. Azul's earnings surpassed estimates in the 
preceding four quarters, with the average being 209%. Ryanair trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of 
the last four quarters and missed the same once, with the average positive surprise being 56.3%. GATX's earnings

Mar 16, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The dreaded 
coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on Mar 11, has 
been a nightmare for stocks, keeping investors on the edge.Due to his health hazard, which has claimed multiple 
lives apart from infecting many more across the globe, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and the Dow Jones plunged to their 
historic lows on Mar 12, resulting in the end of the 11-year bull run.Due to coronavirus woes, the S&P 500, Nasdaq 
and the Dow Jones have tanked 16.1%, 12.2% and 18.8%, respectively, so far this year, paring last year's 
impressive gains.Play Video[1] Jolted Airlines Take Actions to Meet Dwindling DemandEven though coronavirus-
related fears have rattled most sectors, travel-focused stocks, which include airlines, have borne the brunt of the 
outbreak. Evidently, the ZacksAirline[2]industry has shed 35.9% of its value since the commencement of February 
compared with the S&P 500 index's loss of 15.9% in the same time frame.With international travel demand 
dwindling due to the rapid spread of this highly infectious disease, airline stocks are getting clobbered. With the 
disease spreading to countries like Italy, South Korea, Iran, the United States and Germany, many people are 
unwilling to fly to stay safe and avoid contracting the disease from a fellow passenger.In a bid to fight coronavirus-
led low demand for air-travel, airlines from all corners of the globe are trimming their capacity. 
With Italy suffering the most due to COVID-19 in Europe, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], sporting a 
Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy), lowered its 2020 traffic forecast by 3 million to 151 million. Also, Air France KLM AFLYY[4] 
suspended all its flights to/from Italy from Mar 14 through Apr 3.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[5]Airline companies based in the United States too have resorted to various 
measures for tackling the coronavirus-led sharp drop in demand. Evidently, Delta Air Lines DAL[6] will slash overall 
capacity by 40% in the next few months, the highest in its history, including 2001, as air travel demand sees a rapid 
fall and revenues take a hit. Moreover, American Airlines AAL[7] aims to cut international flights by 75% to match 
the extremely-low demand scenario. United Airlines UAL[8] aims to trim capacity by almost 50% in April and 
May.Also, to combat the drop in demand, airlines are reducing capital expenses, discretionary operating costs as 
well as suspending share buybacks.More Turbulence Down the Road?Even though the 30-day ban on travel to the 
United States from 26[9] European countries announced last week by President Trump (expanded subsequently to 
include UK and Ireland) is aimed at preventing further spread of the disease, the development implies a further 
setback to the already beleaguered airline stocks. Moreover, a ban on domestic air travel is also being 
reportedly[10] considered to prevent the spread.With demand fast-disappearing and the scenario unlikely to 
Airlines Brought to Their Knees by Coronavirus: What's Ahead?
improve at least in the near term, first-quarter earnings are likely to be hurt severely by this pandemic. For instance, 
United Airlines, which has already withdrawn its guidance for first-quarter 2020 and the full year as well, expects 
March revenues to be $1.5 billion lower than March 2019. Also, Southwest Airlines LUV[11] recently issued a 
bearish unit revenue guidance for the March quarter due to coronavirus-led low demand. First-quarter operating 
revenues are expected to decline between $200 and $300 million.Moreover, the International Air Transport 
Association currently expects airline passenger revenues for 2020 to be hurt in the $63-$113 billion 
band.ConclusionThe above write-up indicates in no uncertain terms that the airline industry, which even before the 
coronavirus outbreak was suffering from issues like prolonged grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets, has been dealt a 
body-blow. What is more alarming is that the situation is likely to get worse at least in the near term. With the 
adversity showing no signs of abating, revenues in the upcoming summer season, usually considered to be the 
busiest time for U.S. airlines, are likely to be hit badly.In a bid to help U.S. airlines combat this unprecedented crisis, 
the U.S. administration is considering[12] financial help to airlines. Watch this space for further updates on the 
coronavirus and its resultant impact on the airline industry.Today's Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see

Mar 12, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Copa Holdings, S.A. 
CPA[1] reported mixed traffic numbers for February 2020. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger 
miles (RPMs), inched up 0.4% to 1.64 billion in the month. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity 
(measured in available seat miles/ASMs) remained flat at 1.96 billion.With traffic expanding and capacity remaining 
flat, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) increased 40 basis points (bps) to 84%.In the first two months of 
2020, the carrier generated RPMs of 3.5 billion, down 2.9% year over year. In the same time frame, Copa Holdings 
recorded ASMs of 4.1 billion, down 3.8%. With traffic declining less than the amount of capacity contraction, load 
factor increased 80 bps to 84.1%.This fall in capacity was primarily due to extended grounding of the Boeing 737 
MAX jets. The carrier with six Boeing MAX 9 jets in its fleet removed all MAX flights from its schedule through 
August 2020. Consequently, multiple fight cancellations are affecting revenues.Copa Holdings, S.A. Price

Mar 11, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Airline stocks have been 
under the pump lately, mainly due to the coronavirus-led concerns. With this dreaded COVID-19 no longer 
restricted to its country of origin (China), airlines across the world are taking various steps like cancelling flights in 
the face of the severely crippled air-travel demand. With this highly contagious disease spreading to countries like 
Italy, South Korea, Iran, the United States and Japan, many people are unwilling to fly in a bid to stay safe and 
avoid contracting the disease from a fellow passenger.Airline Stocks Bear the BruntWhile it is true that the rapid 
spread of the novel coronavirus, which has claimed more than 4,000[1] lives apart from infecting in excess of 
113,000 people worldwide, rattled almost every nook and corner of the investing space, the airline industry suffered 
a severe jolt with many carriers 'reporting 50% no-shows across several markets' per IATA.Evidently, passenger 
traffic growth across the globe in January 2020 was the slowest in a decade due to the above-mentioned health 
peril. The traffic readings in the following months are likely to be worse as in January, the coronavirus was only 
confined to China and was still considered an epidemic.The sorry state of affairs for airlines is well-reflected in the 
price performance of the ZacksAirline[2]industry. 
In the past month, the industry has plunged 33.2% compared with the S...00 Index's loss of 18.7%.Wake-Up Call to 
Airlines as Demand DwindlesWith air-travel demand diminishingdue to the rapid spread of the disease, airlines from 
all corners of the globe are trimming their capacity. With Italy being very badly hit by the coronavirus outbreak, 
European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] lowered its 2020 traffic forecast by 3 million to 151 million. Notably, 
Ryanair and British Airways suspended all their flights to/ from Italy following the entire nation on lockdown.Airline 
companies based in the United States too have resorted to various measures for combatting the coronavirus-
induced sharp drop in demand. For instance, Delta Air Lines DAL[4] decided to cut its system capacity by 15 points. 
While international capacity is trimmed 20-25%, the measure sees a 10-15 % reduction on the domestic front. 
American Airlines AAL[5] also walked the same path in this low-demand scenario.Management at this Fort Worth, 
TX carrier stated that its international capacity during the peak summer season will witness a 10% cut. Moreover, 
domestic capacity for April will be trimmed to the tune of 7.5%. American Airlines like United Airlines UAL[6] and 
JetBlue Airways JBLU[7] suspended its forecast for first-quarter 2020 and the full year as well.Play Video[8] 
Opportunity Knocks for Intelligent InvestorsThat the coronavirus-led current stalemate is adding to the airline woes, 
can be gauged from the fact that even the recent slump in the oil prices failed to provide some relief to the 
beleaguered battered stocks.However, the prevalent drab scenario should not kill one's investment appetite. At a 
Coronavirus Crisis Crashes Airlines: Should You Buy the Dips?
time when share prices of the airline stocks have declined sharply over the coronavirus-caused concerns, this 
creates an outlet of opportunity to make a killing by acquiring stocks with high potential at the current depressed 
prices.A sensible move would be to buy the beaten-down stocks that are set to gain traction from the encouraging 
fundamentals.3 Beaten-Down Airline Stocks to BuyAzul AZUL[9] is one of the largest airlines in Brazil in terms of 
departures and destinations covered.The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Even though Azul's shares 
have declined more than 42% in the past month, analysts are still bullish on the stock and that sentiment can be 
figured out from the 4.4% upward revision of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 earnings over the past 90 
days. Moreover, current-year earnings per share are projected to increase above 100%, which is way above its 
industry's expected rise. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[10].Ryanair Holdings is 
based in Ireland. Even though shares of this Zacks #1 Ranked carrier have declined 19.2% in the past month, the 
fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised 16.4% upward over the past 90 
days, signifies that analysts have not lost confidence in the Ryanair stock. Moreover, current-quarter earnings per 
share are projected to grow in excess of 100%, which is way above its industry's anticipated rise.Spirit Airlines 
SAVE[11] is based in Miramar, FL. This ultra low-cost carrier currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Even though the 
stock has shed more than 48% of value in the past month, analysts are still optimistic about the stock as that can be 
comprehended from the 11.8% upward revision of the Zacks Consensus for 2020 earnings over the past 90 days. 
Moreover, current-year earnings per share are projected to improve in excess of 7%, ahead of its industry's 
estimated rise.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, 
it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's 
first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades 
early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>[12]Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment

Mar 10, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Hawaiian Holdings, 
Inc.'s HA[1] wholly-owned subsidiary — Hawaiian Airlines — withdrew expectations for operating revenue per 
available seat mile (RASM) for the first quarter due to ambiguity surrounding the impact of coronavirus on air travel 
demand. As of Mar 5, if there are no new net bookings for March, the airline anticipates a 12% decline in the metric 
in the first quarter. Previously, RASM was expected to decline 4.5-7.5% in the period.Meanwhile, capacity is still 
estimated to increase 7.5-10.5% in the quarter. Additionally, adjusted cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, is 
projected to decline 1.5-4.5% in the current quarter, unchanged from previous expectation. With fuel prices having 
declined significantly since the beginning of the year, the carrier now predicts economic fuel cost per gallon to be 
$1.87 compared with the previous forecast of $1.97.Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. Price

Mar 10, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, the 
International Air Transport Association (IATA) increased its revenue decline projection for the airline industry in 
2020. The forecast for the higher amount of revenue losses was due to multiple flight cancellations following the 
rapid spread of the dreaded coronavirus (COVID-19) to multiple countries across the globe.Additionally, passenger 
traffic growth across the globe in January 2020 was the slowest in a decade due to the above-mentioned health 
peril. Moreover, with Italy being one of the worst-affected coronavirus countries, European carrier Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1], which had earlier decided to trim its capacity to/from Italy by 25% from Mar 17 to Apr 8, announced that 
it intends to suspend more domestic and international Italian flights through Apr 8.Coronavirus-related updates were 
also available from U.S. carriers like JetBlue Airways JBLU[2] and Southwest Airlines LUV[3] in the past week. 
While JetBlue withdrew its first-quarter 2020 and full-year outlooks, Southwest Airlines lowered its first-quarter unit 
revenue view due to this health hazard.(Read the lastAirline Stock Rounduphere[4])Recap of the Past Week's Most 
Important Stories 1. According to Alexandre de Juniac, director general and CEO of the IATA, passenger traffic 
growth across the globe in January 2020 was the slowest in a decade. 
Notably, demand (measured in total revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) inched up 2.4% in the month on a 
year-over-year basis, signaling the lowest monthly increase since Apr 2010.Juniac termed the January traffic 
performance of airlines as the 'tip of the iceberg' as 'major travel restrictions in China did not begin until Jan 23'. In 
the opening month of the ongoing year, the health scare was only confined to China and was still considered an 
epidemic. (Read more:Coronavirus Upends Air Travel as Growth Slumps to Decade Low[5]).2. Given the vast 
majority of countries that the coronavirus outbreak has spread to and the resultant slump in forward bookings, the 
IATA now anticipates a global passenger revenue loss of $63-$113 billion for 2020. This is significantly higher than 
the previous projection of a $29.3-billion passenger revenue loss when its estimate was based on the assumption 
that the coronavirus-caused low demand would affect mostly the Chinese market. The research firm anticipates a 
negative $63-billion passenger revenue impact assuming that the outbreak will mostly impact demand in the Asia-
Pacific (China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea), Europe (France, Italy, Germany) and the Middle East (Iran). (Read 
more: IATA's New Forecast Adds Gloom to Coronavirus-Hit Airlines[6]).3. Management at Southwest Airlines now 
expects first-quarter total revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenues) to either dip 2% 
or increase up to 1% from the year-ago figure. The company had earlier anticipated a RASM increase in the 3.5-
Airline Stock Roundup: IATA 's Downbeat Coronavirus -Led Forecast, LUV in Focus
5.5% range for the March quarter.Notably, this Dallas, TX- based Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) airline witnessed upbeat 
passenger bookings in January and February (the first two months of the quarter). However, recently, demand 
declined massively coupled with an increase in trip cancellations. The carrier expects the drop in demand to persist 
in the remainder of March, given the rapid spread of the coronavirus. Consequently, first-quarter operating 
revenues are expected to decline between $200 and $300 million. (Read more: Southwest Airlines Down on 
Coronavirus-Induced Q1 RASM View[7]).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) 
stocks here[8].4. As JetBlue is experiencing 'significant deterioration' in forward bookings since late February due to 
the rapid spread of the coronavirus, the low-cost carrier withdrew its guidance for first-quarter 2020 as well as the 
full year. The carrier expects coronavirus to negatively impact its first-quarter RASM performance significantly. To 
combat this virus-induced low demand, JetBlue is taking steps to control costs. On similar lines, United Airlines 
UAL[9] plans to trim domestic capacity by 10%. The Chicago, IL-based airline intends to cut back U.S. and 
Canadian flights by 10% as well as slash capacity on international schedule by 20% in April. Simultaneously, United 
Airlines is putting hiring (except for crucial positions) on pause at least through Jun 30. (Read more: United Airlines 
Takes Several Steps to Fight Coronavirus Woes[10]).5.Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[11] intends to invest $50 
million in establishing a new base at Concord, NC. The company aims to immediately start hiring pilots, flight 
attendants, mechanics and ground personnel to facilitate operations at the new base, which are expected to begin 
Oct 7, 2020. Notably, the commencement of operations is likely to generate at least 66 high-wage jobs. Moreover, 
two Airbus aircraft will be housed at the new base.(Read more: Allegiant to Set Up $50M Worth North Carolina 
Operational Base[12]).Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players 
over the past week and during the past six months.The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the red 
over the past week inducing the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to decline 11.4% to $73.91 as the coronavirus woes

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/future-of-many-flybe-routes-at-risk-after-collapse/Dozens of routes serving the 
UK's regions could be left without services after the collapse of Flybe.Scotland's Loganair has committed to 
maintaining 16 routes, but many smaller airports still face gaping holes in their schedules. The carrier, Europe's 
largest regional operator, went into administration early on Thursday, after a bid for fresh financial support failed. 
Flybe boss Mark Anderson said he was 'very sorry' for the firm's collapse. He told staff one of the firm's 
shareholders had pulled out at the start of this week, and he had spoken 'frantically to the government' asking for 
rescue aid, but that they had run out of time on Wednesday night.What is happening to Flybe's flights?All of Flybe's 
flights have been cancelled and customers with bookings should not travel to the airport unless they have arranged 
an alternative flight. Flybe operated 210 flights, serving the UK's regional airports and dominating routes out of 
Southampton, Exeter and Belfast. But it also linked regional airports with more than a dozen other European 
destinations. In response to the collapse, the UK government said it would work with other airlines to replace 
services. Aviation minister Kelly Tolhurst said the government also 'stands ready' to support regional airports 
affected by the collapse. She said: 'We recognise the impact that this will have on UK airports particularly those 
which have large-scale Flybe operations.'Will the regions lose those services?Although Flybe is small compared to 
the likes of British Airways, Ryanair or EasyJet, the loss of the operator has been described as 'disastrous' for UK 
regions[1]. Air transport expert John Strickland said Flybe is 'small in the scale of the UK market as a whole, but if 
you're flying out of Exeter, Newquay or specifically Southampton it really is one of the only airline choices so a 
number of regional groups will risk not being served'. However rival airlines are interested in operating at least 
some of the routes. Loganair has opened a special recruitment line for former Flybe employees as it works on plans 
to salvage services on 16 of Flybe's 120 routes[2]. They include flights from existing bases for Loganair, including 
Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Newcastle. Belfast City airport said it was in talks with multiple 
airlines to fill the routes left empty; 77% of its routes were operated by Flybe. Brian Ambrose, chief executive of 
Belfast City Airport, said he was 'pleased' that Loganair will backfill routes between Belfast and Aberdeen and 
Inverness, less than 24 hours after Flybe entered administration. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport, said that 
he 'very much hoped' that other airlines would take up vacant routes. He said discussions with other airlines would 
'begin in earnest' soon and he hoped to reinstate services 'on those routes hopefully within weeks rather than 
months'.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/uk-set-to-leave-eu-aviation-safety-regulator-at-end-of-2020/The UK will leave 
the European aviation safety regulator after the Brexit transition period, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has 
confirmed.He said UK membership of the European Aviation Safety Agency - responsible for certifying the 
airworthiness of planes - would end on 31 December. He said the UK's Civil Aviation Authority would 'bring 
expertise home'. But the owner of British Airways said the CAA lacked world-class knowledge and could not be 
ready in time. 
Mr Shapps told Aviation Week[1] much of the Cologne-based European Aviation Safety Agency's (EASA) expertise 
came from the UK and that a lot of its leaders were British. He said the agency's powers would revert to the Civil 
Aviation Authority (CAA) 'and the expertise will need to come home to do that, but we'll do it in a gradual way'.'Best 
option'The trade body ADS - which represents more than 1,100 UK businesses in the aerospace, defence, security 
and space sectors - told the BBC the decision could potentially mean products and designs would need to be 
certified more than once. For example, EASA is responsible for certifying commercial aircraft for service across the 
EU and some non-EU European countries. When the UK ends its membership of EASA, it may need to certify 
aircraft separately itself. ADS has estimated that it would take 10 years and cost up to 40m annually to create a UK 
safety authority with all the expertise of EASA, against a current contribution to the European agency of 1m to 4m a 
year. It claimed a new regulatory regime could put jobs in the sector at risk. 'We have been clear that continued 
participation in EASA is the best option to maintain the competitiveness of our 36bn aerospace industry and our 
access to global export markets,' the trade body said. It added that the UK's influence within EASA 'contributes to 
raising standards in global aviation' and helped make the industry 'attractive to the investment it needs'. British 
Airways owner IAG said it was 'disappointed' with the decision and said the Civil Aviation Authority 'does not have 
the expertise required to operate as a world class safety and technical regulator'. IAG said: 'The CAA will require 
fundamental restructuring from top to bottom which will take time. There is no way that it can be done by 31 
December.' Airlines UK, which represents carriers including EasyJet and Ryanair, said its members supported 
continued membership of EASA - but not at the risk of the UK becoming a 'dumb follower of EU rules'. It urged the 
government to begin negotiations on an air safety agreement with the EU so it could be ready by the end of the 
year. The Department for Transport said: 'Being a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency is not 
compatible with the UK having genuine economic and political independence. 'We will maintain world-leading safety

standards for industry, with the Civil Aviation Authority taking over these responsibilities, and will continue to work 
with colleagues in the EU to establish a new regulatory relationship.' Read more: UK set to leave EU aviation safety

Mar 06, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate 
ReleaseChicago, IL - March 6, 2020 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Air Travel, including American 
Airlines AAL[1], United Airlines UAL[2], Delta Air Lines DAL[3], LATAM Airlines LTM[4] and Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[5].Industry: Air TravelLink: 
https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/798003/coronavirus-upends-air-travel-as-growth-slumps-to-decade-low[6]That 
the rapid spread of the dreaded coronavirus (COVID-19) rattled stock markets globally is a well-known fact now. 
Having also gripped other parts of the world beyond China — its country of origin — this health hazard is speedily 
assuming pandemic proportions. Notably, this highly contagious disease severely affected countries like Italy, South 
Korea, Iran and Japan. It sounded the death knell for a considerable part of the global populace, having already 
claimed numerous lives apart from infecting many more,While almost all sectors are reeling under its impact , the 
airline space has been one of the worst-hit pockets. The coronavirus spread foiled air-travel plans with many people 
unwilling to take to the skies in a bid to stay safe and avoid contracting the disease from a fellow passenger.IATA's 
January Traffic Report Reveals Drab ScenarioAccording to Alexandre de Juniac, director general and CEO of the 
International Air Transport Association (IATA), passenger traffic growth across the globe in January 2020 was the 
slowest in a decade. Notably, demand (measured in total revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) climbed only 
2.4% in the month on a year-over-year basis, signaling the lowest monthly increase since Apr 2010.Overall capacity 
(available seat kilometers or ASKs) inched up 1.7% in the first month of this year. With traffic growth outpacing 
capacity expansion in the month, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) rose 0.6 percentage points to 
80.3%.Understandably, the Asia-Pacific region (which includes China) witnessed a meager 0.4% year-over-year 
growth in demand in the period. Notably, in January, the viral attack was mostly restricted to China with the city of 
Wuhan in Hubei province surfacing as the epicenter of the disease. Additionally, demand for domestic travel in 
China was the worst, contracting 6.8% year over year in the same month.Traffic Scenario Likely to WorsenJuniac 
termed the January traffic performance of airlines as the 'tip of the iceberg' as 'major travel restrictions in China did 
not begin until Jan 23'. In the opening month of the ongoing year, the health scare was only confined to China and 
was still considered an epidemic.With air-travel demand taking a beating from the fast-evolving coronavirus, airlines 
from all corners of the globe are trimming their capacity. For instance, American Airlines suspended flights

Ryanair
connecting Dallas with China, Hong Kong and Seoul due to lackluster demand following the coronavirus outbreak. 
The carrier also decided to call off all U.S. flights to Milan, Italy, again on account of this soft air-travel demand 
induced by the coronavirus. Fellow U.S. carriers, namely United Airlines and Delta Air Lines also suspended 
multiple flights citing the same issue.Latin American carrier LATAM Airlines also cancelled its daily flight connecting 
Sao Paulo and Milan through Apr 16 because of tepid demand post the coronavirus outbreak. Moreover, the virus 
being rampant in Italy, two of the biggest players in the Italian market, namely, Ryanair Holdings, which sports a 
Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and easyJet, took a massive hit from this health disaster.You can seethe complete list 
of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[7].Notably, Ryanair will cut 25% of its Italian capacity for the Mar 17-Apr 8 
time frame. As a result of this anticipated decline in bookings, the carrier's CEO Michael O'Leary warned of a 
"meaningful impact" of the virus on fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 (ending Mar 31, 2020) results.The sorry state of affairs 
for airlines, as highlighted above, is well-reflected by the price performance of the ZacksAirline[8]industry. In the 
past month, the industry has plunged 25.1% compared with the S...00 Index's loss of 10%.Final WordA slew of 
flight cancellations and dwindling air-travel demand (many carriers are 'reporting 50% no-shows across several 
markets' per IATA) point to a bleak near-term future for airlines. Consequently, the traffic performance, which 
touched rock bottom in a decade in January, is likely to deteriorate in the coming months. So it is not for nothing 
that the IATA currently expects airline revenues for 2020 to be hurt in excess of$29 billion[9]. In fact, the projection 
may further worsen. Watch this space for more updates on the coronavirus onslaught and its resultant impact on 
the airline stocks.Free: Zacks' Single Best Stock Set to DoubleToday you are invited to download our latest Special

IATA 's New Forecast Adds Gloom to Coronavirus -Hit Airlines

Mar 06, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The fast-evolving 
coronavirus outbreak rattled stock markets globally. Almost all sectors are reeling under its effects. However, it is 
the travel industry that is the worst hit. The dreaded coronavirus, having first emerged in Wuhan, China, now spread 
its tentacles to 86 more countries claiming the lives of more than 3,300 people and infecting over 95,000. As of Mar 
6, United States reported in excess of 225 confirmed cases of the virus and a death toll of 12.Given the rapid 
spread of the virus and the consequent plunge in air travel demand, airlines across the globe are trimming capacity 
on international routes. 
For instance, American Airlines AAL[1] suspended flights connecting Dallas with China, Hong Kong and Seoul due 
to lackluster demand following the coronavirus outbreak. The carrier also decided to call off all U.S. flights to Milan, 
Italy. Fellow U.S. carriers, namely United Airlines UAL[2] and Delta Air Lines DAL[3] also suspended multiple flights 
citing the same issue.Latin American carrier LATAM Airlines LTM[4] also cancelled Milan flights from Sao Paulo. 
Due to significant drop in bookings, Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[5] fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 (ending Mar 31, 2020) 
results are likely to be heavily impacted. Notably, Ryanair will cut 25% of its Italian capacity for the Mar 17-Apr 8 
time frame. Also, Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa DLAKY[6], which has exposure to Italy and China, reportedly 
decided to ground 150 of its planes due to weak demand.Among U.S. airlines, United Airlines, carrying a Zacks 
Rank #3 (Hold), is seemingly experiencing the maximum downfall. Flight cancellation apart, the carrier took some 
dramatic measures, such as putting a halt to hiring (except for crucial roles), delaying 2019 merit salary increases 
as well as giving employees the option to apply for unpaid leave of absence voluntarily. Per CFRA analyst Colin 
Scarola, the carrier reportedly generates approximately 40% of total revenues from international route and has 
greater international exposure among U.S. airlines. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[7].The drab picture surrounding the airlines is well reflected in the industry's price performance so 
far this year. The Zacks Airline[8] industry has declined 27.5% in a month compared with the S...00 Index's 9.3% 
decrease.IATA Projects Higher Revenue Loss for 2020Given the vast majority of countries that the virus outbreak 
has spread to and the resultant slump in forward bookings, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) now 
anticipates global passenger revenue loss of $63-$113 billion for 2020. This is significantly higher than the previous 
projection of a $29.3-billion passenger revenue loss when its estimate was based on the assumption that the 
coronavirus-led low demand would impact mostly the Chinese market.The research firm anticipates a $63-billion 
passenger revenue impact, equivalent to an 11% decline, assuming that the outbreak will mostly impact demand in 
IATA 's New Forecast Adds Gloom to Coronavirus -Hit Airlines
Asia-Pacific (China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea), Europe (France, Italy, Germany) and the Middle East (Iran). 
The markets included here have more than 100 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 disease as of Mar 2. Within the 
$63 billion loss, China's share equals $22.2 billion, translating to a 23% decline in passenger numbers. Moreover, 
Asia is expected to suffer a loss of $47 billion.In case the health hazard spreads to a larger extent affecting demand 
in Asia-Pacific (Australia, PR of China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam), Europe 
(Austria, France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, the United Kingdom), Middle 
East (Bahrain, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates) and North America (Canada, United States), 
the IATA anticipates a $113-billion toll (or 19% decline) on global passenger revenues in the current year. The 
markets included here currently have 10 or more confirmed cases of the disease as of Mar 2. The Asia-Pacific 
countries alone are estimated to witness a 32% decrease in passenger numbers, equivalent to a $57.3-billion 
revenue loss. The European market is likely to report the second largest revenue loss of $43.9 billion, implying a 
33% drop in passenger numbers. Canada and the United States are estimated to bear a loss worth $21.1 billion 
with 10% fall in passengers transported.Is the Worst Coming for Airlines?The impact of the coronavirus on the 
airline industry is already seen to be more damaging than the SARS outbreak in 2003. Additionally, it is worth 
nothing that China, which accounts for roughly 20% of the global GDP, is more important to the global economic 
scenario now than it was in 2003. Consequently, any slowdown in the Chinese economy will have ramifications 
across the globe.As uncertainty looms large on the extent and duration of the virus, it is perhaps not far off for the 
industry to endure a situation similar to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. In fact, the IATA's forecast of a $113-
billion passenger revenue loss for 2020 is nearly commensurate with what the airlines had faced during the financial 
crisis of 2008.With substantial decline in oil prices since the beginning of 2020, the IATA expects fuel cost saving of 
up to $28 billion for the ongoing year over and above the savings from reduced capacity. This should provide some 
cushion to the airlines in dealing with this deep crisis.Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the 
early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of 
electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it's 
expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.A select few stocks could skyrocket the most 
as rollout accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s.

ireland-hosts-networking-event-in-madrid/30970#respond Tourism Ireland in Spain unveiled its key themes for 2020 
at an event in Madrid recently, attended by over 60 travel and lifestyle journalists. 
Attendees including representatives of Cond Nast Traveller, National Geographic, El Mundo and 5 Das, as well as 
popular bloggers and social influencers. Partners from the island of Ireland were also in attendance including Taste 
...ur NI, showcasing produce like Young Buck cheese, Ispini charcuterie and Abernethy Butter; and the Kinsale 
Food Circle, showcasing Blacks of Kinsale Gin, Kinsale Mead and Koko Chocolates. Kinsale and Cork is the area 
of Ireland with which Tourism Ireland in Spain is 'twinned' for 2020. 'In 2019, we welcomed around 443,000 Spanish 
arrivals to Ireland,' said Barbara Wood, Tourism Ireland's Manager Spain. 'Our Fill Your Heart With Ireland 
campaign is now live, targeting Spanish travellers on video websites and social platforms. We are also rolling out a 
number of co-operative campaigns with partners like Aer Lingus, Ryanair, Iberia Express and Logitravel.' 
[embedded content] The organisation is placing a greater focus in 2020 on driving growth to less visited attractions 
and locations, as well as on driving business in the off-peak and shoulder seasons. Around 37% of all Spanish 
visitors to Ireland arrive in the off-season months (Q1 and Q4) and Tourism Ireland sees this as an opportunity to 
win business at a time when there is capacity in accommodation and other tourism facilities. Tourism Ireland will roll 
out a TV, outdoor and digital campaign with Aer Lingus this spring, promoting fares on flights from Barcelona to 
Shannon and Cork. Tourism Ireland will also work with Ryanair, from the end of February until the end of March, 
promoting flights from Girona to Shannon and from Madrid and Barcelona to Dublin. Other joint campaigns this 
spring will see include work with Iberia Express and with online travel agents such as Logitravel and Atrapalo.

Mar 05, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  United Airlines Holdings 
Inc UAL[1] is planning some dramatic capacity reductions and stringent cost controls as the airline battles against 
receding air travel demand from the fast-evolving coronavirus outbreak.In a first by any U.S. airline, the carrier 
plans to trim domestic capacity by 10%. The Chicago, IL-based airline intends to cut back U.S. and Canadian flights 
by 10% as well as slash capacity on international schedule by 20% in April. The flight schedule reductions might 
continue in May as well.Simultaneously, United Airlines is putting a stop to hiring (except for crucial roles) at least 
through Jun 30. Also, 2019 merit salary increases for all management and administrative employees is being 
postponed from April 1 to July 1. This excludes employees falling under the collective bargaining agreements, who 
will continue to receive timely increments.The plight of the carrier can be further gauged from the airlines' decision 
giving employees the option to apply for unpaid leave of absence voluntarily. In some cases, they can also ask for a 
reduced work schedule.With the airline reportedly having greater international exposure among all U.S. airlines, the 
novel coronavirus outbreak, having already spread to more than 75 countries across the globe infecting more than 
95,000 people and claiming over 3,200 lives, is clearly taking a significant toll on its prospects.Coronavirus-Led Low 
Demand Weighs on SharesEarlier in the month, United Airlines cancelled its investor day amid uncertainty 
surrounding its long-term strategy, considering how unclear the extent and duration of the viral outbreak is. 
The carrier already withdrew[2] its 2020 outlook.With a substantial drop in demand, the carrier extended the 
suspension of its U.S. flights to mainland China and Hong Kong through Apr 30, 2020 from the previous 
cancellation through Apr 24. Additionally, the airline reduced approximately two thirds of its flights to Seoul, a third 
of flights to Japan and 40% of flights to Singapore. Moreover, the Chicago, IL-based airline is operating some 
routes on a smaller aircraft due to slackened demand.To counteract the waning demand situation and encourage 
customers to travel without worrying over change in travel plans, United Airlines recently waived change fees on 
bookings through Mar 31. Customers can cancel tickets (in exchange for another ticket for travel within 12 months 
from the date of issuance of the ticket) without any change fees.Amid this turbulence, shares of the company have 
plunged more than 26% in a month's time.Viral Outbreak Rattles Airline IndustryConcerns over the rapidly-
spreading virus outbreak has crippled the entire airline industry by significantly lowering travel demand. In 
response, numerous airlines across the globe, including Delta Air Lines DAL[3], American Airlines AAL[4], Ryanair 
Holdings and LATAM Airlines are trimming capacity. JetBlue Airways JBLU[5] also plans to cut capacity by 
approximately 5%[6] "in the near term to address the fall in demand". The airline is also taking other cost-control

Mar 04, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted impressive February traffic figures as air-travel demand was solid in the month. Traffic (including 
0.5 million from its LaudaMotion unit in Austria) rose 9% year over year to 10.5 million.However, load factor (% of 
seats filled with passengers) remained unaltered at 96%. This low-cost carrier's passenger growth excluding traffic 
from LaudaMotion unit was 8% in the month. On a rolling annual basis, total traffic increased 9% to 153.8 million. 
This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Irish carrier operated more than 58,000 scheduled flights in February.You can

Ryanair 
Holdings 
PLC 
price[4] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[5]Coronavirus Woes May Weigh on Traffic Ahead However, the carrier might 
not be able to replicate February's stellar traffic results, at least in the near term. 
Notably, Ryanair will cut 25% of its Italian capacity in the Mar 17-Apr 8 time frame following reduced air-travel 
demand due to the rapid spread of the disease across many European countries.As a result of this anticipated 
decline in bookings, traffic and load factor are likely be 'lower than normal' in March and April. In fact, Ryanair's 
CEO Michael O'Leary warned of a "meaningful impact" of the virus on fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 (ending Mar 31, 
2020) results.Notably, Ryanair is not the only carrier to have trimmed its capacity due to the viral outbreak. U.S.-
based carriers including American Airlines AAL[6], United Airlines UAL[7] and the Latin American carrier LATAM 
Airlines LTM[8] also suspended various flights in the wake of the coronavirus onslaught beyond its country of origin, 
China.Today's Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating

Mar 04, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
companies like the U.S.-based American Airlines AAL[1], the European carrier Ryanair RYAAY[2] and the Latin 
American LATAM Airlines LTM[3] suspended various flights as the dreaded coronavirus (COVID-19) spread it 
tentacles beyond its country of origin, China. In fact, this contagious disease now left an impact on every continent 
barring Antarctica, claiming multiple lives and infecting in larger numbers.In another coronavirus-related update, 
United Airlines UAL[4] postponed its investor day. Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines SAVE[5] grabbed headlines as it came 
out with an expansion-related update. Moreover, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Delta 
Air Lines DAL[6].(Read the Last Airline Stock Rounduphere[7]).Flashback to Past Week's Top Stories1. American 
Airlines, which already cancelled flights connecting the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) with China 
and Hong Kong, now suspended flights between DFW and South Korea's Incheon International Airport due to 
lackluster demand following the coronavirus outbreak. 
Flights on the Dallas-Seoul route are expected to commence on Apr 25, 2020. The carrier also decided to suspend 
all U.S. flights to Milan, Italy, again due to this soft air-travel demand induced by the coronavirus. (Read more: 
American Airlines to Cancel Milan Flights on Coronavirus Woes[8]).American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks (Strong Buy) here[9].2. United Airlines 
deferred its investor day, scheduled to be held on Mar 5, to September due to the plaguing coronavirus scare. 
Management feels that given the current situation it will not be feasible to have a productive conversation revolving 
around its long-term strategy. Simultaneously, the carrier cut back flights to Japan, South Korea and Singapore, 
significantly due to low demand on these routes. The airline reduced approximately two thirds of its flights to Seoul, 
a third of flights to Japan and 40% of flights to Singapore. (Read more: United Airlines Calls Off Investor Day on 
Coronavirus Threat[10]).3. Per a Reuters report, LATAM Airlines announced the cancellation of its daily flight 
connecting Sao Paulo and Milan through Apr16 due to tepid demand post the coronavirus outbreak. Citing the 
same reason, Ryanair plans to lower its flight frequency to and from Italy by 25%. Capacity in the airline's primary 
market, Italy, will be slashed for the Mar 17-Apr 8 period. However, Ryanair's flight cancellations will not leave as 
much an impact as anticipated on its current financial year ending Mar 31.(Read more: Ryanair to Cut Back Flights 
to Italy Amid Coronavirus Fears[11]).4 In a bid to expand its international footprint, Spirit Airlines announced that it 
will include more flights from the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport to two international

destinations, namely, Cancun, Mexico and San Pedro Sula, Honduras. While flights connecting New Orleans with 
Cancun will be operational from Jun 10, 2020 onward, services on the New Orleans-Honduras route will start the 
following day. (Read more: Spirit Boosts Global Network, Adds Flights From New Orleans[12]).5. Taking advantage 
of the sharp depreciation in stock price as the coronavirus persistently wreaks havoc, Warren Buffett, considered 
one of the greatest (if not the greatest) investors of all times, raised his stake in Delta. Per a Bloomberg report, this 
Berkshire Hathaway founder and CEO purchased more than 976,000 shares of the airline behemoth for $45.3 
million.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of major airline players over the past week and 
during the past six months.The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the red over the past 
week inducing the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to decline 6.9% to $80.73. Over the course of six months, the sector 
tracker has inched up 0.6%.What's Next in the Airline Space?Investors will await the fourth-quarter 2019 earnings

Mar 04, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate 
ReleaseChicago, IL - March 4, 2020 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every 
day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial 
markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1], LATAM Airlines LTM[2], United 
Airlines UAL[3], Delta Air Lines DAL[4] and American Airlines AAL[5].Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst 
Blog: IATA Request Spells Further Challenges for Coronavirus-Hit AirlinesThe rapid spread of the dreaded 
coronavirus (COVID-19) rattled the airline industry significantly by crippling air-travel demand. This is evident from 
the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) last-monthprojection[6], which suggested that airline revenues 
for 2020 might be hurt in excess of $29 billion due to this adversity. 
Per this research firm's latest commentary, it requested an immediate suspension of rules governing the usage of 
airport slots. This statement further adds to the gloomy scenario.Alarmingly, the coronavirus outbreak is now no 
longer restricted to its country of origin, China. The health scare spread it tentacles fast to every continent barring 
Antarctica ever since it was first detected late last year. The contagious disease already registered a death toll of 
above 3,000 people apart from infecting more than 88,000, globally.As a result of this health peril, the 
ZacksAirline[7]industry has declined 21.9% in the past month as it grapples with dwindling demand for international 
travel. The S...00 Index has also shed 10.3% of value in the same time frame.Against this backdrop, the IATA's 
request to aviation regulators worldwide for suspension of slot-use rulesfor the entire season (through Oct 2020) is 
fully understandable.Delving DeeperCurrently, around 43% passengers depart from more than 200 slot-coordinated 
airports, globally. Per the existing rules for slot allocation, the concerned carrier under normal circumstances needs 
to operate at least 80% of the slots allocated to it. In the event of non-compliance, the airline has to give up its right 
to the slot in the next equivalent season. The concerned regulator can relax the above rule under special 
circumstances.Why the Request?Various airlines across the globe are trimming their capacity as the coronavirus 
outbreak is speedily becoming a full-blown pandemic from an epidemic. Reportedly, the European low-cost carrier 
Ryanair Holdings decided to reduce flights to/from Italy by 25% for three weeks. The decision to cut capacity in its 
largest market followed a significant decline in bookings due to this health hazard.According to a Reuters report, 
Latin American carrier LATAM Airlines also planned to cancel its daily flight from Sao Paulo to the Italian

Airlines
destination, Milan, through Apr 16 due to coronavirus-induced tepid demand. LATAM's U.S. counterparts, namely 
United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines also decided to slash flight frequency in a bid to combat the 
sharp drop in air traffic.For instance, Delta and American Airlines recently chose to suspend some flights 
connecting the United States with Milan. Moreover, United Airlines cut back flights to Japan, South Korea and 
Singapore due to substantially weak demand on these routes. Additionally, this Chicago-based airline, which carries 
a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is offering travel waivers to Italy. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. Going by IATA, many carriers are 'reporting 50% no-shows across several 
markets.'With airlines across the world swinging into action to tackle this tepid demand caused by the health threat 
as highlighted by the above evidences, the current scenario certainly qualifies as an exceptional circumstance. 
Therefore, it is widely perceived that the existing slot-allocation rule that requires the concerned carrier to operate 
minimum 80% of its allocated slots should be made flexible. This, in turn, will allow airlines to adjust their schedules 
to suit the current situation of low air-traffic.Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech

Mar 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per Reuters[1], Ryanair 
Holdings plc RYAAY[2] plans to reduce flights to and from Italy by 25% following a significant drop in bookings in 
the region due to the coronavirus outbreak. Capacity in the airline's primary market, Italy, will be slashed for the 
period between Mar 17 and Apr 8. This European low-cost carrier witnessed a dramatic fall in ticket purchases over 
the past week and a "significant step up" passenger no-shows, especially from and within Italy.However, Ryanair 
does not expect its flight cancellations to have as much of an impact on its current financial year ending Mar 31. As 
far as the virus' impact on its next year 's results is concerned, the carrier feels that it is "far too early to 
speculate".Ryanair Holdings PLC Price            https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price?icid=chart-RYAAY-

Milan from the United States citing a drop in demand. 
The airline suspended Milan flights from New York (JFK) and Miami through April 24.Latin American carrier LATAM

IATA Request Spells Further Doom for Coronavirus -Hit Airlines
IATA Request Spells Further Doom for Coronavirus-Hit Airlines

Mar 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The rapid spread of the 
dreaded coronavirus (COVID-19) rattled the airline industry significantly by crippling air-travel demand. This is 
evident from the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) last-month projection[1], which suggested that 
airline revenues for 2020 might be hurt in excess of $29 billion due to this adversity. Per this research firm's latest 
commentary, it requested an immediate suspension of rules governing the usage of airport slots. This statement 
further adds to the gloomy scenario.Alarmingly, the coronavirus outbreak is now no longer restricted to its country of 
origin, China. 
The health scare spread it tentacles fast to every continent barring Antarctica ever since it was first detected late 
last year. The contagious disease already registered a death toll of above 3,000 people apart from infecting more 
than 88,000, globally.As a result of this health peril, the ZacksAirline[2]industry has declined 21.9% in the past 
month as it grapples with dwindling demand for international travel. The S...00 Index has also shed 10.3% of value 
in the same time frame.Against this backdrop, the IATA's request to aviation regulators worldwide for suspension of 
slot-use rulesfor the entire season (through Oct 2020) is fully understandable.Delving DeeperCurrently, around 43% 
passengers depart from more than 200 slot-coordinated airports, globally. Per the existing rules for slot allocation, 
the concerned carrier under normal circumstances needs to operate at least 80% of the slots allocated to it. In the 
event of non-compliance, the airline has to give up its right to the slot in the next equivalent season. The concerned 
regulator can relax the above rule under special circumstances.Why the Request?Various airlines across the globe 
are trimming their capacity as the coronavirus outbreak is speedily becoming a full-blown pandemic from an 
epidemic. Reportedly, the European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] decided to reduce flights to/from 
Italy by 25% for three weeks. The decision to cut capacity in its largest market followed a significant decline in 
bookings due to this health hazard.According to a Reuters report, Latin American carrier LATAM Airlines LTM[4] 
also planned to cancel its daily flight from Sao Paulo to the Italian destination, Milan, through Apr 16 due to 
coronavirus-induced tepid demand. LATAM's U.S. counterparts, namely United Airlines UAL[5], Delta Air Lines 
DAL[6] and American Airlines AAL[7] also decided to slash flight frequency in a bid to combat the sharp drop in air 
traffic.For instance, Delta and American Airlines recently chose to suspend some flights connecting the United 
States with Milan. Moreover, United Airlines cut back flights to Japan, South Korea and Singapore due to 
substantially weak demand on these routes. Additionally, this Chicago-based airline, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold), is offering travel waivers to Italy. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks 
IATA Request Spells Further Doom for Coronavirus -Hit Airlines
here[8]. JetBlue Airways JBLU[9] also announced a waiver in its change and cancel fees for all new flight bookings. 
Going by IATA, many carriers are 'reporting 50% no-shows across several markets'.With airlines across the world 
swinging into action to tackle this tepid demand caused by the health threat as highlighted by the above evidences, 
the current scenario certainly qualifies as an exceptional circumstance. Therefore, it is widely perceived that the 
existing slot-allocation rule that requires the concerned carrier to operate minimum 80% of its allocated slots should 
be made flexible. This, in turn, will allow airlines to adjust their schedules to suit the current situation of low air-
traffic.Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/british-airways-ryanair-cancel-hundreds-of-flights-due-to-coronavirus-
outbreak/British Airways and Ryanair have cancelled hundreds of flights between the UK and parts of Europe and 
the US due to the coronavirus outbreak.The BA cancellations include journeys between Heathrow and Italy, France, 
Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland and Switzerland - plus New York's JFK. 
The airline has also cancelled flights between Gatwick and Italy, France and Albania - and London City flights to 
and from Italy and Germany - after another spike in COVID-19 cases in the UK. BA said the changes to its 
timetable as a result of the coronavirus outbreak would see 'a number of flights merged between 16 March and 28 
March'. A spokesman for the airline said: 'We will be contacting customers on cancelled flights so we can discuss 
their travel options, including re-booking on to other carriers where possible, full refunds or booking with BA for a 
later date of travel. 'Customers can also find the latest information and options on BA.com[1].' Ryanair is reducing 
frequencies on some routes by up to 25%, particularly affecting flights to and from Italy. The Dublin-based carrier 
said it would operate a reduced schedule between 17 March and 8 April because of a 'significant drop in bookings' 
over the period caused by concern over COVID-19. Other measures being introduced by Ryanair include 'rolling 
schedule cuts' allocating leave or paid leave to pilots and cabin crew, working with suppliers to cut costs, and 
freezing recruitment, promotion and pay. BA said it is cancelling 12 round-trips from Heathrow to JFK from 17 
March to 28 March. It is also scrapping 171 short-haul roundtrip flights from Heathrow to countries including Italy, 
France, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland over the same dates. The cancellations affect seven short-
haul BA roundtrip flights from Gatwick to Italy, France and Albania from 16 March to 25 March. And BA is cancelling 
26 short-haul roundtrip flights from London City Airport to Germany and Italy from 17 March to 28 March. More than 
89,000 confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 have been recorded globally and there have been more than 
3,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the outbreak. Read more: British Airways

Feb 27, 2020( Kerry Underwood: http://kerryunderwood.wordpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The matters dealt 
with in this piece are examined in great detail in my three volume, 1,300 page book Personal Injury Small Claims, 
Portals and Fixed Costs - price 50 and available from Underwoods Solicitorshere[1]. Kerry Underwood offers 
consultancy services in relation to this and other matters and details arehere[2].  I have waited a long time to write 
up this decision, which, apart from being distinguishable on its facts in most other cases, is wrongly decided and 
one of the most anti access to justice decisions, even by the current Court of Appeal, which means it was faced with 
some stiff opposition. Just a reminder that this is the Court of Appeal which has brought you: UNISON - upholding 
Employment Tribunal fees - subsequently banned 7-0 by the Supreme Court; lawfulness of Johnson's proroguing 
Parliament - hammered 11-0 by the Supreme Court; Mitchell and relief from sanctions - had to overrule itself within 
months in Denton; Bott ... Solicitors Ltd v Ryanair - allowing Ryanair to respond direct to solicitors' clients avoiding 
the solicitor getting paid - in clear breach of the Supreme Court's own ruling in Gavin Edmondson - Supreme Court 
has given permission to appeal; Swift v Carpenter [2020] EWCA Civ 165i - No Protective Costs Order.  Mis-
Reporting  The decision has been further damaged by hopeless misreporting and some unfortunate comments by 
the successful lawyers. 
I understand, and support, the cab rank principle but gloating about a decision which threatens access to justice for 
most of the population is a different kettle of fish. PJ Kirby QC, who appeared for the successful Ms Herbert in the 
Court of Appeal, quoted various headlines in a piece entitled 'Herbert v HH Law: What does it mean for you?' 
'Upsurge in costs challenges looms after court rules on 100% success fee The ruling will set alarm bells ringing in 
the personal injury sector, with many firms having adopted the policy of setting a 100% success fee and claiming 
the maximum limit of 25% of total damages.' Law Society Gazette 'Success fee ruling could open assessment 
'floodgates'' - Litigation Futures ' few can doubt that life for low-value personal injury claimant solicitors has become 
increasingly difficult over the past decade. Herbert v HH Law provides no respite.' Partners in Costs 'Court of 
Appeal rules against blanket 100% success fee in low-value PI claims since LASPO' - Association of Costs 
Lawyers 'Court of Appeal holds that 100% success fee lawful provided solicitor can show informed consent No 
problem if you see your client and explain' - Kerry Underwood 'Going forwards, it is likely to be an uphill struggle, 
when entering into new CFAs, to show that the average lay client has given informed consent to a success fee that 
15% SUCCESS FEE: HERBERT AND COURT OF APPEAL: WRONG IN LAW, WRONG IN PRINCIPLE AND 
DISTINGUISHABLE
does not fairly reflect the risks of the case.' Simon Gibbs of GWS.  Mis-Understanding  Adam Grant, Policy Officer 
at the Association of Costs Lawyers, in his Practical Law Dispute Resolution Blog of 20 May 2019 - Solicitor/client 
success fees and Herbert v HH Law Ltd said: 'Today the deductions of the success fee from damages are, in many 
cases, merely making up the shortfall in costs not recovered between the parties on successful cases, let alone the 
unsuccessful ones. To have this reduced significantly below the statutory cap could well leave a black hole in many 
a firm's finances.' That may in fact be what is happening, as indeed happened here, but it is entirely the wrong way 
of billing under the Solicitors Act 1974. What should happen is that a final statute bill under the Solicitors Act 1974 
be delivered to the client for unrecovered solicitor and own client costs. Given that nearly all solicitors cap the total 
charge to the client, and not just the success fee element, at 25% of damages, the success fee very often does not 
come into play. Mr Grant's argument that those charges will be subject to scrutiny as the client does not know how 
much they will be, is misinformed. That is the position in every hourly rate retainer and a Conditional Fee 
Agreement is an hourly rate retainer with the twist that the client does not have to pay on defeat. Solicitors are 
obliged in all cases, including Conditional Fee Agreement cases, to provide the client with full costs information, 
estimates and regular updates. The case did not decide that on a solicitor and own client assessment the additional 
liability in a simple personal injury case should never exceed 15%. What it did decide is that if a risk assessment is 
not to be undertaken, then the solicitor must obtain informed consent from the client in order to satisfy CPR 46.9(3), 
and that would require the client's approval after a full and fair explanation. In this case that would have required the 
solicitor to tell the client that the success fee took no account of individual risks, but was charged as standard. The 
fact that very many firms used the same business model of 100% success fees in all cases did not avoid this 
requirement. Practical Law correctly reported the decision: ' personal injury practices are likely to have fees reduced 
on assessment if they did not advise clients that success fees were not set on the basis of risk assessment'.  After-
the-Event Insurance Premium Cannot Be Challenged  The Court of Appeal also considered whether the cost of the 
After-the-Event insurance premium should be treated as a solicitor's disbursement, or merely an entry in the client 
cash account. It held that a disbursement qualifies as a solicitor's disbursement if: '(1) it is a payment which the 
solicitor is, as such, obliged to make whether or not to put in funds by the client, such as court fees, counsel's fees, 
and witnesses' expenses; or (2) there is a custom of the profession that the particular disbursement is properly 
treated as included in the bill as a solicitors' disbursement.' It held that an After-the- Event insurance premium fell 
into neither category, being a premium on a policy of insurance by which the client was insured pursuant to a 
contract they entered into with insurer. It was not a litigation cost at all and there was no evidence of a custom of 
including the premium within a solicitor's bill to the client, as opposed to a between the parties' bill. Consequently, it 
need only appear in the cash account and is not susceptible to assessment, although under section 70 of the 
Solicitors Act 1974 the court also considers the cash account as well as the solicitor's bill. Practice Direction 46, 
paragraph 6.6(b) describes it as: 'An account that includes money received by the solicitor to the credit of the client 
and sums paid out of that money on behalf of the client, but excludes outgoing payments that were made in 
satisfaction of the bill.' Paragraph 6.19 of the Practice Direction states: 'After the detailed assessment hearing is 
concluded the court will  (a) complete the court copy of the bill so as to show the amount allowed;  (b) determine the 
result of the cash account.' The purpose of the cash account is to enable the court to see the full extent of the 
solicitor's financial dealings with the client, since it will show sums expended on items which have not appeared in 
the bill. The solicitor can only recover items which the court certifies have been reasonably charged in the bill. 
There is no obligation on the client to pay for anything that has not appeared in the bill. Thus, it is essential to know 
what is and what is not a disbursement, since if, by accident or design, the solicitor misses a valid disbursement off 
the bill, it is irrecoverable from the client on a section 70 assessment. The cash account deals with money 
expended by the solicitor on behalf of the client for anything which is not in the bill, or which ought not to be there 
and includes items which the solicitor is not bound by law or custom to pay.  The Success Fee Decision Bizarrely, 
the original judgment - and of course on appeal it is always the original judgment, and not subsequent appeal 
decisions, which is under review - was a paper assessment, by consent of the parties, with no oral hearing - see the 
judgment of District Judge Bellamy, 28 April 2017[3]. The District Judge found that there was no clear evidence that 
the client had given informed consent to incur the 100% success fee. The supreme irony of this case is that in fact 
there was no success fee at all. All of the costs actually charged to Ms Herbert, as compared with those recovered 
from the other side, could have been charged as unrecovered solicitor and own client costs. However HH Law, 
presumably unaware of the law, and certainly unaware of the Underwoods Method, did not do so, but rather 
delivered a Solicitors Act 1974 statute bill wrongly describing the charge as a success fee and that wrongly 
15% SUCCESS FEE: HERBERT AND COURT OF APPEAL: WRONG IN LAW, WRONG IN PRINCIPLE AND 
DISTINGUISHABLE
described charge was the subject of the litigation, and ultimately the Court of Appeal decision. HH Law Ltd 
submitted a witness statement from a Mr Craig Ralph dated 20 March 2017, which read, in part: '6. As a firm, we 
considered that the easiest and most transparent way was to make a solicitor own client charge, by way of a 
success fee which the client could pay out of damages. The success fee would be based on the basic costs that we 
actually recovered from the other side, thus limiting the fee. 7. We considered that clients would readily understand 
that method in principle, and we also thought it was fair, as the client's interests would be protected by the statutory 
cap on deductions from certain categories of damages of 25%. An individual client would therefore always retain 
75% (at least) of his/her damages. 8. Conversely, charging the client an increased hourly rate, or requiring the client 
to pay hourly rates when only fixed costs were going to be recovered in many cases, seemed to us to be more 
cumbersome, result in the hardest fought and most difficult cases carrying the heaviest burden of irrecoverable 
costs and less fair.' I cannot even begin to analyze the thinking behind that statement and method, particularly the 
idea that it is unfair for a client with the most difficult and hard fought case to risk paying more, albeit capped at 25% 
of damages. Ben Williams QC, one of the top cost lawyers in the country, commenting on Simon Gibbs' blog said: 
'There is no obligation for a success fee to reflect risk between solicitor and own client, so long as the client 
appreciates the basis on which it is set. Why can't a solicitor say: 'you have two options - win or lose payment, or no 
win-no fee payment; for no win-no fee, I require a premium of 100 per cent to act on those terms. This premium is 
not based on risk, it is simply the consideration I stipulate for the CFA terms which I am not otherwise willing to 
give'? If the client chooses the latter option, why should he be able to revisit that?' As one would expect from Ben 
Williams QC, this is absolutely correct. It is something which judges appear not to understand; that is that the 
alternative to a success fee model which makes a reasonable profit for the solicitor to reflect the fact that they will 
not be paid if they lose, is to pay the full hourly rate win or lose. The alternative is not some cooked up, half baked, 
unprofitable, unworkable scheme devised by Court of Appeal judges who have not the slightest idea what it is like 
to practice as a solicitor in the real world and spent their legal careers earning fat fees, win or lose. Ben Williams 
also makes a point that I have always made, and that is that no business model can work if it simply puts a risk-
taker in the same position as they would have been had they not taken the risk; very obviously no one would ever 
take a risk if that was the case. The point is that the whole model of success fees being cost neutral is an utter 
nonsense - as I make crystal clear in my book on the subject - No Win, No Fee, No Worries. Furthermore, given the 
particular success fee model, this does not work, even on its own terms. The maximum success fee is 100%, and 
that is assumed to be appropriate if the risk is 50% - that is win one, lose one and you break even because you get 
a 100% success fee on the winner. Let us assume that the charge in each case is 10,000. If you charged, win or 
lose, the traditional business model, then by winning one case and losing one case you get paid 20,000.On a no-
win, no-win fee basis you get the following:  - lost case 0 - won case 10,000 - 100% success fee 10,000 Total 
20,000Thus the solicitor breaks even on that model, but gets no reward for taking the risk. However, as Ben points 
out - and I set out his comment below - how does that work if the chances of winning are 40%? On the theoretical 
model the success fee would have to be over 100% for the solicitor to break even as compared with charging the 
full rate, win or lose. However, the maximum success fee in any type of case is 100%. I set out Ben Williams QC's 
comments in full: '(1) The whole notion that a success fee should only reflect the pure 'burning cost' of risk, and 
should therefore be cost neutral across a solicitor's book of cases, was always dubious, and should never have 
been accepted without challenge. It's all very well to say that a solicitor who takes on 100 CFA cases on a 100% 
success fee will break even so long as she wins 50, which she will do on average (assuming 50/50 risk, else adjust 
figures as appropriate). But suppose he wins only 40? That is obviously a real possibility, as risk assessment is 
inherently uncertain. If this happens, she will not be able to pay her staff, and she goes bankrupt. That's a risk that a 
solicitor who refuses CFA terms would not face. The solicitor taking on the CFA work ought to be able to charge a 
*premium* for this sort of risk. It is not enough to break even on a theoretical basis. (2) A lot of solicitors will now be 
regretting the standard Law Soc CFA that says 'this is not a contentious business agreement'. If the CFA was a 
contentious business agreement, the ability of client's to attack success fees retrospectively would now be reduced. 
Compare the HH case to the failure of the challenge to the success fee under a non-contentious business 
agreement in Bolt Burdon v Tariq. (3) The confirmation that an ATE premium is not a solicitor's disbursement re-
ignites an issue that the courts have always ducked: on what basis does the court purport to adjust the 
methodology of a policy if the substituted methodology could never have been obtained by the receiving party or 
her solicitor in the market? The court has no power to alter the policy itself. The court can only act if the client and 
solicitor took out an unreasonable policy. But how can the policy be unreasonable if there was not a better 
15% SUCCESS FEE: HERBERT AND COURT OF APPEAL: WRONG IN LAW, WRONG IN PRINCIPLE AND 
DISTINGUISHABLE
alternative that actually existed in the market?' What the Court of Appeal in fact does, but in a clumsy and unhelpful 
way, is to make clear that to get any sort of workable success fee, the client must be seen, and a full explanation 
given. PJ Kirby QC, who appeared for the successful Ms Herbert, said: 'It is possible to have 100% success fee the 
question is whether the client has given informed consent to the same. It is unlikely that a court would be satisfied 
that informed consent had been given unless there had been a face to face meeting with the client where the fees 
had been explained and where it had been made clear that the success fee that was being charged was not based 
on the risk involved in their particular case. It would probably also be necessary to explain that success fees had 
previously always been calculated by reference to risk and that a risk related success fee would be much lower. It 
may also be necessary to explain that other solicitors may charge a success fee by reference to the risk involved 
and that they would therefore deduct a smaller amount from the recovered damages.  Here is my write up of the 
original appeal decision of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court in Herbert v HH Law Ltd [2018] EWHC 
580 (QB)[4]. Success Fee and Risk In Herbert v HH Law Limited [2018] EWHC 580 (QB)[5] the Queen's Bench 
Division of the High Court upheld the decision of DJ Bellamy whereby he reduced the success fee in a road traffic 
accident case from 100% to 15% on a solicitor and own client assessment. The court also upheld a finding that an 
After-the-Event insurance premium was a solicitor's disbursement. The Court of Appeal has now given leave to 
appeal against the High Court's findings. The District Judge accepted the defendant's submission that CPR 46.9 
'places the burden on the client to prove the charges are unreasonable. It also significantly restricts the scope of the 
court's discretion to interfere with contractually agreed amounts through the mechanism of the presumptions.' The 
District Judge took into account that the solicitors never met the client and 'had little or no direct contact with the 
client.' Paragraph 20 of the judgment quoting paragraph 12 of the District Judge's judgment: 'The Claimant appears 
to have been referred to the solicitors (details unclear from the file) and the solicitors take instructions on the 
telephone. There is no face-to-face meeting subsequent to that discussion but there followed significant 
correspondence, terms and conditions, and documentation in relation to the CFA. There is no evidence on the file 
of any formal risk assessment, nor note of any discussion in relation to the success fee. Whilst accepting the 
retainer between solicitor and client is contractual in nature, the reality is that litigation funding of itself is complex, 
risk assessments and success fees add a further level of complication, as does the charging arrangement of the 
solicitors. This is an unsophisticated client dealing, by referral, with a claim for damages arising out of a road traffic 
incident, the circumstances of which appear from the file note relatively straightforward, it being a rear end collision 
with the claimant's stationary car. It seems to me not a difficult hurdle in those circumstances for a Claimant to 
overcome to rebut the presumption of reasonableness in CPR 46.9(3). There is no clear evidence the Claimant 
approved either expressly or impliedly, with full knowledge, the cost to be incurred, and more particularly, a success 
fee of 100% could easily be said to be unusual both in nature and amount given the circumstances of the claim that 
were known to the solicitors at the time. Further, there is no risk assessment on the file that would in any event 
justify as being reasonable, a success fee of 100%'.' The High Court held that approval required informed consent 
by the client and that 'the simple refrain of freedom of contract establishes neither the presumptions nor the 
reasonableness of the success fee in the particular case.' The High Court also held that risk was likely to be the 
primary factor in fixing the success fee (Paragraph 44).The key paragraphs are 46 and 47: '46. Like the Judge, I 
accept that 46.9(4) is not free-standing and that CPR 46.9 must be read as a whole. Thus if a client applies for a 
reduction in the success fee, he may be met by evidence that he gave his informed approval to the percentage 
identified in the CFA. If so, the presumption in 46.9(3)(a) and/or (b) is likely to be satisfied and will be difficult to 
dislodge. Alternatively, if the presumption is not established, the costs judge will proceed to the assessment and 
hence the reasonableness of the success fee percentage. 47. Putting the point another way, if and insofar as HH 
took no account of the risk in the individual case and provided for a 100% uplift (subject to the 25% cap) in all cases 
by reason of its particular post-LASPO business model, I consider that informed approval would require this to be 
clearly explained to the client before she entered the agreement.' This leaves open the question of whether a 
solicitor who has met the client and explained everything in the manner recommended in Vilvarajah v West London 
Law Ltd [2017] EWHC B23 (Costs)[6] is safe from attack on the success fee.  Comment This decision is all over the 
place, but it is not clear here what the basis of the charge to the client was. The actual costs charged to the client 
was 691 plus VAT, being 25% of the damages. The claim was an ex-portal RTA claim which settled for 3,400 after 
proceedings had been issued and, although it is not clear from the judgment, I am assuming that post-issue pre-
listing fixed costs applied and if that is the case the recoverable costs are 1,840 being 20% of the damages plus 
1,160 as per CPR 45.29 Table 6 B. Here the solicitor and own client basis of charging was 118 an hour with 22 
15% SUCCESS FEE: HERBERT AND COURT OF APPEAL: WRONG IN LAW, WRONG IN PRINCIPLE AND 
DISTINGUISHABLE
hours work done giving a total 2,596. Thus the unrecovered solicitor and own client costs are as follows:  solicitor 
and own client costs 2,596 less recovered costs 1,840 Total 756 These are costs net of VAT, and as we have seen 
the actual charge to the client was 691 plus VAT. Consequently, unless I am missing something, there was in fact 
no success fee at all in this case as all of the charge to the client fell within the unrecovered element of solicitor and 
own client costs. Clearly 118 per hour is a very modest rate and appears not to have been challenged. In those 
circumstances, the decision appears to be obiter, in the sense that the court did not need to rule on the success fee 
as in law no actual success fee was charged. It is well established law that academic claims cannot be brought; in 
other words the client cannot bring a Solicitors Act 1974 challenge in relation to a bill never delivered, even if the 
retainer contained challengeable provisions. If I am correct, and this decision is obiter, then of course it is not 
binding. As far as I am aware there has been no successful challenge in any court in the country to the Underwoods 
Method, and contrary to some ill-informed comment, this decision supports, rather than challenges the Underwoods 
Method. What solicitors may now well start to do, particularly given the increase in the small claims limit in personal 
injury matters, is to reserve the right to charge the full element of the unrecovered solicitor and own client costs, 
either completely uncapped, or possibly capped at say 40% of damages, and then charge a 15% success fee as 
well. Obviously, this means that the client will receive far less of their damages than at present. Whether that was 
clear to the Court of Appeal or not, I do not know, but it is blindingly obvious to anyone who actually considers these 
matters and has experience of them. This is as Pyrrhic a victory as it gets - instead of all solicitors routinely capping 
the total charges to the client, be that unrecovered solicitor and own client costs and/or the success fee, at 25% of 
damages, solicitors will now be forced to adopt a different model. The Underwoods Method avoids these 
challenges, and I have always advised capping the total charge to the client at 25% of damages. However, as such 
reasonableness and generosity on the part of solicitors has been treated with complete contempt by the Court of 
Appeal, I see no reason why solicitors should continue to be so generous to their clients. My advice now is to cap 
the total charge to the client at 40%, not 25%, but to charge the full unrecovered solicitor and own client costs at the 
full normal private rate. [ 1]: http://www.underwoods-solicitors.co.uk/book-kerry-underwood.htm [ 2]:

Feb 26, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Schneider 
National SNDR[1] have lost 10.7% against the industry[2]'s 5.2% rise in a year's time. The below-par performance 
was primarily caused by unfavorable pricing and closure of First to Final Mile ('FTFM') operations.Let's take a look 
at the factors that are responsible for the dismal price performance.Revenues in the truckload segment declined 
(8.3% in 2019) due to lower freight demand against higher truck capacity. Also, revenues in the logistics unit fell 
8.7% in 2019. Moreover, this situation is unlikely to improve in the near term.Additionally, closure of FTFM 
operations within the truckload unit is limiting bottom-line growth due to increased costs. 
Moreover, the return on equity (expressed as a percentage) for the company is currently 10 compared with 15.6 for 
its industry. This indicates that the company does not utilize shareholders' funds efficiently.Deterioration in 
operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is also a concern. Evidently, the metric (on an 
adjusted basis) came in at 95.6% in 2019 compared with 92.4% in 2018.Also, the company has an unimpressive 
record with respect to earnings per share. Schneider has trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 12.2%, 
on average.Negative Estimate Revisions and Zacks RankThe pessimism surrounding the stock is evident from the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised downward by 5.9% in the past 60 days to 
$1.28.Additionally, Schneider National carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks

Feb 25, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Ryder System 
R[1] have lost 19.3% compared with the industry[2]'s 0.6% decline in the past month. The stock underperformed the 
industry primarily due to weak used vehicle sales. Soft freight conditions have mainly lowered used vehicle 
sales.Let's take a look at the factors that are responsible for the dismal price performance.Ryder is plagued by 
below-par used vehicle sales thanks to low pricing and increased wholesaling activity. 
Weak freight conditions led to this downside. Moreover, bleak freight scenario is expected to persist at least until 
the second half of the year.Ryder expects revenues in the Dedicated Transportation Solutions segment to drop 1% 
in 2020 due to reduced sales activity and fewer large deals signed in the latter half of 2019.The downturn in the 
Supply Chain Solutions unit due to loss of business is another concern. Notably, revenues in the segment slid 3% in 
the fourth quarter of 2019. The adversity is anticipated to continue through the middle of 2020.Moreover, with Ryder 
investing substantially in its contractual lease fleet, capital expenditures are increasing, thereby hurting the bottom 
line. High debt levels further add to its woes.Negative Estimate Revisions ...ak Momentum ScoreThe negativity 
surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised 
downward by 29.8% in the past 60 days to $1.77.The company's Momentum [3]Score of F further highlights its 
short-term unattractiveness.Additionally, Ryder carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Stocks to ConsiderSome 
better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation [4]sector are Delta Air Lnes DAL[5], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] 
and Azul S.A. AZUL[7]. Delta carries a Zacks Rank#2 (Buy), while Ryanair and Azul sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8].Shares of Delta , Ryanair 
and Azul have rallied more than 6%, 5% and 17%, respectively, in a year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast 
year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. 
Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of

Feb 25, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of J.B.Hunt 
Transport Services, Inc. JBHT[1] have lost 2.4% against the industry's[2] 8.4% rise in a year's time. The 
unfavorable performance was caused by escalating operating expenses and disappointing performance in the truck 
segment.Let's take a look at the factors that are responsible for the dismal price performance.Acquisition-related 
costs and high operating expenses — including increased wages for drivers as well as rail purchased transportation 
costs are limiting bottom-line growth. 
Moreover, driver shortages are hurting the company's operations for quite some time. Notably, operating expenses 
increased 6.3% in 2019.Sluggish freight scenario is affecting volumes in the Truck segment. Truck revenues 
plunged 6.7% in 2019 due to lower loads and soft truck pricing. Consistent below-par performance in this unit will 
likely hurt the stock.Moreover, J.B. Hunt is a highly-leveraged company with its debt-to-equity ratio (expressed as a 
percentage) currently at 57.2 compared with the industry's 20.2. This implies that the company is funding most of its 
ventures with debt.Also, the company has a below- par track record with respect to earnings per share (EPS), 
having underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters. The company reported 
better-than-expected EPS in the other quarter. The company has trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 
6.3%, on average.Negative Estimate Revisions and Weak Momentum ScoreThe negativity revolving around the 
stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings being revised downward by 6% in 
the past 60 days to $5.6.The company's Momentum[3] Score of D further highlights its short-term 
unattractiveness.Additionally, J.B.Hunt carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks 
in the transportation [4]sector are Delta Air Lines DAL[5], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] and Azul S.A AZUL[7]. Delta 
Airlines carries a Zacks Rank#2 (Buy), while Ryanair and Azul sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see 
the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[8]Shares of Delta Air Lines , Ryanair and Azul 
have rallied more than 6%, 5% and 17%, respectively, in a year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it 
generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed 
investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of money for 
regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

Feb 24, 2020( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Italy has 
reported a sharp rise in cases of coronavirus over the weekend. That has sent markets into frenzy, as the continent 
grapples with the prospect of a pandemic reaching its shores.A sharp increase in the number of confirmed 
coronavirus cases in Europe over the weekend, the vast majority of them in Italy, has prompted investor jitters in 
markets.The Italian stock exchange in Milan is down 4.3%, on course for its biggest one-day percentage loss since 
June 2016. Elsewhere in Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 has fallen 2.6%, Germany's DAX is down 3.3% and the Paris 
CAC has slipped back by 3.4%. The pan-European STOXX 600 has also fallen by more than 3%.The sell-off 
appears to have been prompted by the wave of new cases in Italy. There are now over 150 confirmed cases in the 
country, up from just three on Friday. 
Four people have died from the virus in the country."It would appear the coronavirus has finally caught up with the 
markets," Craig Erlam, an analyst with foreign exchange company OANDA told AFP."The deceleration in new 
Chinese cases gave investors a reason to buy the dip, but the spike outside of the country in the last few days 
supercedes that. Investors, in their determination not to miss a dip-buying opportunity, have been caught 
premature. This could sting," he said.Airlines take a big hitEuropean investors have rushed out of equities and into 
safe havens such as gold and US government bonds. The European sell-off mirrors similar firesales in Asian 
markets, sent into a frenzy by a surge in cases in South Korea.Airline stocks have taken a particular battering, with 
international transport an obvious casualty in the event of a global pandemic. European airlines EasyJet and 
Ryanair plunged by 12% and 10% respectively, while a host of others also tumbled.As well as travel, stocks in 
tourism and luxury concerns are also down sharply. Sectors reliant on China for their supply chains, in particular the 
car industry, also continue to lag badly.Many investors expect the fall to continue now that coronavirus fears appear 
to have moved beyond China and the Asia-Pacific region. "Markets [are] likely to show extreme caution in the face 
of [the] global spread of the coronavirus — this is no longer solely an Asia issue," Robert Carnell, chief Asia-Pacific 
economist at ING, told the Financial Times.Italian lockdownAway from the markets, the sharp rise in coronavirus 
cases is having a very real and practical impact on economic activity in Italy.The government there has imposed a 
strict quarantine across more than 10 towns in the northern region, where officials are trying to limit the spread of 
the biggest outbreak of the virus outside Asia.The Italian outbreak is centred around the regions of Lombardy and 
Veneto, where Venice and the Italian industrial and financial hub of Milan is located. Those two regions account for 
around one-third of Italy's entire economc activity. Many of the cases suddenly emerges in the small town of 
Codogno, 65 kilometers (40 miles) south-east of Milan.Schools and universities in the region have been closed 
while several major public events have been affected. Milan Fashion Week, the major clothing trade show, has 
Coronavirus European surge sends panic through markets
been disrupted while the Venice Carnival was cut short by two days on Sunday.Aside from the quarantined towns, 
travel into Italy has been hit. Austria, which shares a 404-kilometer (251-mile) border with Italy, is considering 
border controls.On Sunday night, Austria refused entry to a train coming from Italy after the Italian State Railways 
told the Austrian train operator OBB that two people on board had fever symptoms.All train traffic between the 
countries was briefly suspended but that was lifted within a few hours.In the wake of the developments in Italy, the 
European Commission has announced a €232 million ($251 million) aid package to help member states fight the 
outbreak.China still the centerWhile the outbreak in Italy has brought the coronavirus firmly onto European soil, the 
epicenter of the problem remains firmly in China, both in health and economic terms.There are now just under 
80,000 confirmed cases worldwide and of these, more than 77,000 are in China.Despite the new European fears, 
China has actually eased restrictions in several places, including in Beijing, as the rate of new infections fell 
back.Nonetheless, economic activity in China has been hit dramatically by the coronavirus outbreakand that had 
already been felt globally before the rise in new cases outside China over the weekend.China is the EU's second-
largest trade partner. with combined trade of €559 between the two in 2019. The EU Chamber of Commerce in 
China's President Jörg Wuttke has already spoken of the fact that foreign businesses' operations have been 
seriously disrupted in China that they may have to look elsewhere for supplies.He said that while the Chinese 
market is "always a lure, people have now woken up to the fact that you must have a backup plan."

Feb 23, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Michael O'Leary, CEO of the Irish 
budget carrier Ryanair, is facing criticism for suggesting Muslim men flying alone should be singled out as threat at 
airports. He explained in a recent interview that families with young children should not be subjected to airport 
security checks because there was zero chance of them being bombers, but added that terrorists 'will generally be 
males of a Muslim persuasion'. 'Thirty years ago it was the Irish. 
If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat', O'Leary said. His comments were widely condemned 
on social media, with activists demanding a Ryanair boycott. The Muslim Council of Britain called the comments 
'racist and discriminatory'. 'Why can someone like O'Leary spread Islamophobia like this today? Because he thinks 
people don't care. It's time to boycott Ryanair. Also for many other reasons', German Green party politician Ali Baş 
tweeted. 'In Germany this week a white person killed eight people. Should we profile white people to see if they're 
being fascists?', said the UK's politician Khalid Mahmood from the Labour party. The company later denied that 
O'Leary had called for Muslim men to face extra security checks before boarding a plane: 'Michael was only calling 
for more effective airport security checks which would do away with much of the unnecessary queues at airport 
security today for all passengers', a spokesman said. O'Leary has been known for his controversial comments 
before. Previously, he said most airport security was 'utterly useless', and complained that airlines unfairly got the 
blame for climate change. He also suggested that passengers should pay to use the toilet on his flights, said that 
requirements for Ryanair's Dublin offices to have disabled access to all floors were 'nonsense', and said that he 
may charge a 'fat tax' on obese people.

Feb 22, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  REUTERS/Peter 
Nicholls/File Photo Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary is facing criticism after calling on airports to profile Muslim men 
traveling alone. In an interview with The Times[1], O'Leary said that "males of a Muslim persuasion" who are 
traveling alone are more likely to be "bombers" and pose a higher risk to airlines than other passengers. O'Leary 
faced criticism from hate crime monitoring groups and a Labour MP who accused him of stoking racism and 
Islamophobia. Ryanair told Sky News[2] that O'Leary's statements were "simply inaccurate." 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[3]. The CEO of one of the world's largest airlines is facing 
criticism after saying Muslim men should be profiled at airports. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, 58, made the 
comment during an interview with The Times[4], saying that "males of a Muslim persuasion" who are traveling alone 
are more likely to be "bombers" and pose a higher risk to airlines than other passengers. He went on to say that 
profiling of Muslim families doesn't have to be as strict because "the chances [they] are going to blow them all up is 
zero." "You can't say stuff, because it's racism," O'Leary, who's held Ryanair's CEO position since 1994, told The 
Times. "Thirty years ago, it was the Irish. If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat." O'Leary, 
one of the wealthiest men in Ireland, faced criticism from hate crime monitoring groups and Labour MP Khalid 
Mahmood, who accused the airline CEO of Islamophobia in a comment to Sky News. The Muslim Council of Britain 
told the Guardian:[5] "This is the very definition of Islamophobia. Institutional discrimination against Muslims is well-
established: whether it is the ability to get a job, buy a flat or even getting car insurance. The challenges of flying 
while Muslim are well documented across the globe. Ryanair told Sky News[6] that O'Leary's statements were 
"simply inaccurate." "Michael was only calling for more effective airport security checks which would do away with 
much of the unnecessary queues at airport security today for all passengers," a spokesman said. O'Leary's 
interview with the Times included a number of disparaging comments, including calling the need for wheelchair 
facilities on every floor of a Dublin office building "complete and utter nonsense." He made fun of transgender rights 
and the need for gender-neutral bathrooms; and called obese passengers "monsters" who should consider buying 
two seats. Read more: I flew on the 'world's worst short-haul airline,' Ryanair, and it was so comfortable and stress-

Feb 12, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Copa Holdings, S.A. 
CPA[1] reported below par traffic numbers for January 2020. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger 
miles (RPMs), slipped 5.7% to 1.82 billion in the month. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity 
(measured in available seat miles/ASMs) dropped 7% year over year to 2.16 billion.The downside was caused by 
reduced capacity due to the extended grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX jets. The carrier with six Boeing MAX 9 
jets in its fleet removed all MAX flights from its schedule through March 2020[2]. Consequently, multiple fight 
cancellations are affecting revenues. The company's fourth-quarter performance is likely to get impacted by this 
drab scenario.Meanwhile, with traffic declining less than the amount of capacity contraction, load factor (% of seats 
filled by passengers) increased 120 basis points to 84.2% in January.Copa Holdings, S.A. Price

Feb 10, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Investors looking for 
stocks in the Transportation - Airline sector might want to consider either Delta Air Lines (DAL) or Ryanair (RYAAY). 
But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a 
closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an 
impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. 
The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores 
work to identify stocks with specific traits.Both Delta Air Lines and Ryanair have a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) 
right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so 
investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part 
of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to 
help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value 
grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash 
flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.DAL currently has a 
forward P/E ratio of 7.93, while RYAAY has a forward P/E of 17.92. We also note that DAL has a PEG ratio of 0.57. 
This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes 
into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. RYAAY currently has a PEG ratio of 1.12.Another 
notable valuation metric for DAL is its P/B ratio of 2.43. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value 
versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, RYAAY has a P/B of 
2.97.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to DAL's Value grade of A and RYAAY's Value grade of D.Both 
DAL and RYAAY are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel 
that DAL is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Feb 10, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Azul S.A. AZUL[1] 
released strong traffic numbers for January, highlighting solid demand for its services. Consolidated traffic 
(measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) rose 29.1% year over year to 3.32 billion owing to 28.3% 
growth on the domestic front and a 31.5% rise internationally. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or 
available seat kilometers/ASKs) expanded 26.5% to 3.9 billion, driven by 25.2% and 30.5% increase in domestic 
and international capacity, respectively.With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, load factor (percentage of 
seats filled by passengers) improved a commendable 170 basis points (bps). While domestic load factor jumped 
200 bps, international load factor climbed 70 bps.Owing to solid air travel demand, the company has been 
witnessing robust rise in passenger revenues. 
Notably, passenger revenues, accounting for more than 90% of the top line, augmented 23.4% during the first nine 
months of 2019. The uptrend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter as well, aiding the company's overall 
results in turn. Detailed report will be available on Mar 12.Shares of Azul have rallied 32.9% in a year's time against 
the industry's 0.2% decline, primarily owing to the uptick in passenger revenues. The company's fleet modernization 
efforts to replace older generation aircraft with larger, more fuel-efficient planes also boosted performance.Zacks

banned an ad campaign from Ryanair that claimed the company had the #8216;lowest carbon emissions of any 
major airline.#8217;Last year the low-cost airline was ranked tenth behind nine coal companies as Europe's leading 
carbon emitters, according to the European Commission.The ASA found that the claims around #8216;lowest

were concerned that the basis of the claims had not been made clear in the ads and that the evidence provided was 
insufficient to demonstrate that Ryanair was the lowest carbon-emitting airline on the basis of that metric.#8217; [

European Union, has gone from strength to strength in the past few years. The Irish labor market is currently tight 
with unemployment at a 13-year low. 
Also, the country's finance ministry has raised its growth forecast for the Celtic Tiger.Finally, broadly encouraging 
business conditions and improving Irish wages have also been pivotal in shaping up this economy. Such favorable 
conditions call for investing in stocks from Ireland.13-Year Low Unemployment Per the latest reports from Ireland's 
Central Statistics Office (CSO), the country's unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.8% in December. This 
also happens to be the metric's lowest settlement in the past 13 years. Furthermore, economists remain optimistic

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-warns-job-cuts-cannot-be-ruled-out-after-737-max-delay/Ryanair has 
warned more pilot and cabin crew job losses #8216;cannot be ruled out#8217; after the latest delay in the return to 
service of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft.It comes after Boeing last week admitted it might be July before the MAX fleet 
#8212; grounded globally after two deadly crashes #8212; may be clear to fly again. 
Ryanair had been hoping to take delivery of ten of the aircraft in May or June, ahead of the peak summer season, 
but said in a memo to staff that it will now not be able to receive them until September or October at the earliest. 
That means it is having to #8216;urgently revisit#8217; its summer 2020 schedule, according to the memo #8212; 
which was first seen by the Reuters news agency. #8216;Sadly, this means we cannot rule out further base cuts 
and closures,#8217; it said. #8216;We will do our best to avoid any more base closures, but this will mean 
eliminating at least ten aircraft from existing bases, and so further pilot and cabin crew job losses cannot be ruled 
out.#8217; The memo was sent to staff by Eddie Wilson, chief executive of the Ryanair airline brand which operates 
as part of the wider Ryanair group headed by Michael O'Leary. Mr Wilson said the company would try to advise all 
bases in the first or second week of February #8216;as to what further cuts and/or closures will be required as 
direct result of these further Boeing MAX delivery delays#8217;. #8216;I apologise sincerely for this uncertainty, 
and for any worry it may cause you,#8217; he added. Mr Wilson said the airline would try to minimise outright base 
closures in favour of cuts and reductions in flight frequency. The 737 MAX was grounded last March after 346 
people died in two crashes attributed to anti-stall software. Ryanair has a fleet of more than 450 aircraft and is one 
of the biggest MAX customers, with 210 on order. The group's chief executive said last month that the grounding of 
the fleet was costing it at least €100m (84m) a year. Ryanair has already cut a number of bases over the winter, 
leading to cabin crew and pilot job cuts. Read more: Ryanair warns job cuts #8216;cannot be ruled out' after 737

Jan 25, 2020( Deutsche Welle Germany: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/germany/s-1432 Delivered by Newstex)  The 
number of passengers taking domestic German flights has fallen for the second year in a row. The industry says the 
drop is not due to environmental concerns despite a Swedish campaign of flight shaming or flygskam.For the 
second year in a row, the number of passengers on German domestic flights has declined, according to data from 
the German Airports Association (ADV), as reported by the news service Tagesschau on Saturday.The number of 
domestic passengers in 2019 fell by 1.9% from the year before to 47.1 million. 
In 2018, passenger figures fell by 0.8%Figures have dropped continually since August last year, the association 
said. Read more: To fly or not to fly? The environmental cost of air travelThe number of passengers on domestic 
flights in 2019 was just 1% greater than the figures from a decade ago.Meager growth internationallyThe number of 
passengers on international connecting flights was up, though growth has slowed.Last year, 244.3 million 
passengers made international connections in Germany, an increase of 1.5% over the year before, the slowest 
growth in six years.The ADV said a strike by Germanwings pilots at the end of 2019 was partly responsible for the 
low figures. Higher costs and greater competition also played a role, they said. Some airlines, like Easyjet, Ryanair, 
and Eurowings, reduced the number of flights offered last year. A slowing global economy and high oil prices also 
had an effect.Not due to 'flight shaming'The ADV said the drop in passengers was not related to increased concern 
over the link between climate change and CO2 emissions from flying or so-called flight shaming."Negative 
influences are growing," the association had said in December, referring to troubles within the industry and global 
economic trends. The German Aviation Association (BDL) told DW there were two reasons for the drop in domestic 
passenger demand."The first is the cooling global economy — declining global trade and trade conflicts. Secondly, 
the insolvencies of Germania and Air Berlin," BDL said in a statement, adding excess capacity from both airlines 
had been withdrawn from the market.Read more: Next time you fly for vacation, buy your right to polluteFrankfurt

Everyone Hates Spirit Airlines, How Is It Making So Much Money?[1] #8212; Marker by Medium Good read on 
Spirit. I keep waiting for the airline to do something playful with Trevor Noah the same way Arby's did with Jon 
Stewart back in the day. Separately, I love Ben Baldanza's quote #8216;Businesses that look at what people say 
don't do as well as businesses that look at what people actually do.#8217; Truth. After years of design and testing, 
it's almost time to fly. The #777X[2] will make its first flight as early as January 23, subject to weather and other 
factors. Learn more about the airplane:

yesterday if not for bad weather. Boeing could use any kind of good news at this point. Two for the roadThe return 
of the legendary US airline you've probably never heard of[6] #8212; CNN Travel Well if that doesn't make me feel 
old. I've flew the old Eastern as a kid, and I have absolutely no affinity for the brand. I've written this up before. No 
airline is a good name to bring back, but Eastern especially does not have a positive connotation, and I'm not sure it 
ever really did. Its founder was stingy, and well, in the end, things got worse.Newsletter:Some pricing trickery from 
JetBlue[7] #8212; Los Angeles Times I find myself wanting to agree with David Lazarus most of the time, but in the 
end I rarely do. In this case, he starts off strong. JetBlue raising the bag fee to $35 and then calling it a consumer 
benefit is the worst kind of PR attempt. And bag fees have the potential of becoming outrageously high, just like 
change fees. But then he loses me. The solution is for businesses to offer a single, all-inclusive price for goods and 
services.That's how they do it across the Atlantic. The European Union says consumers #8216;have to be clearly 
informed about the total price, including all taxes and additional charges.#8217; In other words, the price you see 
listed is the price you pay.Hmm, someone should probably tell Ryanair, easyJet, and Wizz about that. It's just 
completely not true. Bag fees are good, and a la carte structures benefit those who don't need everything when

Jan 20, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Momentum investing 
revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be 
essentially be "buying high, but hoping to sell even higher." With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a 
stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. 
The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though 
momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and 
worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores[1], helps 
address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Ryanair (RYAAY), which currently has a Momentum Style Score 
of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings 
estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock 
rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Ryanair currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 
(Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of 
A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank 
Stocks here >>>[2]Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if RYAAY is a promising momentum pick, let's examine 
some Momentum Style elements to see if this airline holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look 
at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the 
upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a 
particular area.For RYAAY, shares are up 9.67% over the past week while the Zacks Transportation - Airline 
industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly 
price change of 5.59% compares favorably with the industry's 0.27% performance as well.Considering longer term 
price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past 
quarter, shares of Ryanair have risen 25.19%, and are up 36.46% in the last year. In comparison, the S...00 has 
only moved 11.51% and 28.5%, respectively.Investors should also take note of RYAAY's average 20-day trading 
volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume 
baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above 
average volume is typically bearish. Right now, RYAAY is averaging 311,678 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings 
OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price 
changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can 
What Makes Ryanair ( RYAAY ) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?
help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with RYAAY.Over the past two months, 3 earnings 
estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost RYAAY's 
consensus estimate, increasing from $4.39 to $4.92 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates 
have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven 
these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that RYAAY is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. 
If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Ryanair on your short 
list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks

Jan 20, 2020( Jon Worth: http://www.jonworth.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Hey journalists! I'm glad to see you're 
writing about trains! BB running its first NightJet to Brussels seems to have got you into a particular frenzy. It's 
amazing what a bit of red carpet at Gare du Midi, and Martin Selmayr on board[1], can do to generate a bit of 
interest, eh?
 But you see that with all your 'oooh look night trains are nice!' you're right where the Austrian Railways, BB, wants 
you. 'Shiny train! It's green!' Ooooh, gushing story[2]. Netherlands is subsidising the reintroduction of night trains[3], 
and BB - with its twice weekly service to Brussels with an awful timetable (arriving 10.55am) - is making a similar 
political pitch to the EU. We are the good guys, subsidise things like this. At least BB has an international view. But 
competition in rail, perhaps not that. The basic thing you have to remember about most railway firms is this: the total 
number of passengers travelling by rail in Europe is not of concern to them. Yes, you read that right. They do not 
care about the total numbers of people travelling by rail. The focus is instead on maintaining their share in a 
national market. We want to keep our passengers on our trains. And anyone else trespassing on our patch is a 
danger to us. Have you ever wondered why there as many DB InterCity trains (7 a day) in Germany to Norddeich 
Mole[4] (population 1837, yes fewer than 2000 people live there) as there are daily DB ICEs (also 7) to Brussels (a 
pretty important capital)? Or why SNCF created its low cost brand OUIGO[5] - a completely owned subsidiary, it's 
like a Ryanair train, if it gets cancelled you cannot take a regular TGV. But yeah it's still 'service public' and any 
rivals can be kept out of the French market. Both of these cases are because maintaining national position is more 
important than actually increasing the numbers of passengers on trains. There would be another way to solve the 
lack of night trains in Europe problem than getting governments to subsidise services, as BB would like. It would be 
to solve the track access charges (the fee each train pays per kilometre) problem - making it cheaper to run trains 
at night when anyway the networks are emptier. But if you are, say, SNCF Infra[6], do you you want the Austrians 
running trains on your lines? No. Because were customers to get a taste for it, the next time they might choose to 
take a BB train from Strasbourg to Paris rather than a SNCF one. Or - shock of shocks - perhaps a private rival like 
Flixtrain[7] or Leo Express[8] might see a market the state operators have vacated[9], and seek to fill that void. 
Letting someone else in means letting everyone in. Oh and what about back in Austria? WESTbahn is a rival to BB 
on the Wien - Linz - Salzburg route oh, and that firm is 26% owned by French state operator SNCF[10]. Or in other 
words precisely what would benefit BB in Netherlands or in France to run there, is exactly the thing they fear back in 
Don't be distracted by BB 's shiny night train to Brussels - the problems of EU-wide rail run far deeper
their own national market. So there is the rub. That is why booking trains cross-border is a pain (as my recent BE-
FR[11] and BE-NL[12] cases have shown). That's why passenger rights in the absence of through tickets has not 
been solved in the EU. That's why there is still no reliable and complete database of all trains running in the EU. 
Solving each of those things would help maximise the numbers of people taking the train. But all of those things 
would likewise endanger the national position of rail companies like SNCF or BB, or NS, SNCB or Deutsche Bahn. 
And he who lobbies hardest wins the argument, and what better way to do that than put on a nice shiny night train 
from Vienna to Brussels and have Karima Delli (chair of the EP Transport Committee), Martin Selmayr (formerly 
Juncker's chief of staff, now head of the Commission Rep in Vienna), Michel Reimon (Austrian Green MEP) and 
Othmar Karas (Austrian VP MEP) on board? And don't worry, SNCF, Deutsche Bahn, NS or SNCB, we're the good 
guys, a state railway from Austria, so if the EU can provide us a nice little subsidy, and politicians can get their shiny 
night train (even one every day of the week), everyone is happy, right? Well, probably not. Because the real 
deficiency - that no operator really has a strong incentive to improve rail's market share overall - remains 
unchanged. The post Don't be distracted by BB's shiny night train to Brussels - the problems of EU-wide rail run far 
deeper[13] appeared first on Jon Worth Euroblog[14]. [ 1]: https://twitter.com/eszterz/status/1219196287964340225

Jan 17, 2020( Coolsmartphone: http://www.coolsmartphone.com Delivered by Newstex)  With Christmas and the 
entire festive season just a dim and distant memory now, people are planning to escape the dark, cold and wet 
winter nights by booking a summer holiday. After getting the right deal, you've got to consider saving the money to 
pay for it all and planning things out so that you make the most of your time there.For me, I'm useless at all that. I'll 
not save enough, then I'll end up putting everything on the credit card and miss half of the interesting sights and 
tourist spots because I didn't do any preparation. Saving For me, I use the Moneybox app. They have two types of 
account - one for saving and one for investing. You can put a regular amount in or round-up your purchases and 
add cash that way. The only thing you will have to keep an eye on is the lead-time that needs to be considered 
when you decide to take money out. Right now, the 95-day saving account is the one I'm using, but I obviously 
need to give at least three months notice to get that cash out again. 
https://www.coolsmartphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot_20200117-161941897-1.jpg 
Other 
options include 'Digit', which will help you save money and will help you to straighten out your finances after the big 
festive splurge. It'll create savings goals ahead of your holiday and you can watch as that money starts to stack up 
without it encroaching on your daily life too much. You can also look at 'Piggy Goals', 'Savings Tracker' and 'Money 
Manager'. There's a lot out there and, for me, it's the daily or weekly on-screen reports that really give me a boost.

With travel companies like Thomas Cook vanishing, many are now constructing their own holidays. A cheap Easyjet 
or Ryanair flight, then a hotel or Airbnb booked separately - it's easily done and you can use apps like TripAdvisor 
to plan your holiday, get ideas for restaurants, tours and attractions. As an example, if you're planning to go a bit 
further afield, and you like your meat, you can search for that. Brisket, baby back ribs, chicken and pulled pork, 
there is a wide choice available. Whilst searching, I found that Grandview Las Vegas[1] did all this, delivering WiFi, 
a 
kitchen, 
hot 
tubs 
and 
more

reviews. It'll compare prices on resorts and cruises too. There's so much here that it's a great way to plan out what 
activities you'll be interested in. You can book them in advance too, so you know it's all done and dusted. Other 
worthy apps include 'Guides by Lonely Planet', 'TripIt' and Expedia. You can also check out hotels via apps such as 
Hotels.com 
and 
Trivago.

little things you might need - like sun cream, new shorts, trunks and suitcases - sit uncomfortably next to super-
important things (like passports, car-hire and so on), so I tend to use Google Tasks, Microsoft To-Do and Tasks

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ba-owner-leads-the-complaints-with-eu-over-taxpayers-flybe-rescue/The 
parent firm of British Airways has lodged a complaint with the European Union over the UK government's support 
that is enabling Flybe to keep flying.International Airlines Group (IAG) confirmed the move hours after an angry 
statement from its chief executive Willie Walsh declared the rescue a 'blatant misuse of public cash'. After it was 
revealed on Sunday night that the regional airline was in frantic talks to avert collapse, ministers announced on 
Tuesday evening that an agreement had been struck to safeguard its immediate future. The terms included the 
deferral of Air Passenger Duty (APD) payments, amounting to more than 100m, in return for the independent 
airline's major shareholders injecting tens of millions in new funds. 
The measures, to date, mean 2,400 jobs at Flybe are safe - for now. But no additional details have been released 
and the government is understood to still be negotiating a loan on commercial terms with the airline, casting 
continuing doubt on its long-term future. The bailout reflects the seriousness of how ministers view the threat to UK 
transport connectivity should Flybe, which focuses its operations on domestic regional airports, fall. While 
explaining the reasons for the aid, the Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said Flybe was a 'viable' company. IAG 
was yet to provide details of its complaint to Brussels but it is likely to be based on the belief the bailout constitutes 
illegal state aid, under EU law. In an earlier letter to the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, Mr Walsh wrote: 'Prior 
to the acquisition of Flybe by the consortium which includes Virgin/Delta, Flybe argued for tax payers to fund its 
operations by subsidising regional routes. 'Virgin/Delta now want the taxpayer to pick up the tab for their 
mismanagement of the airline. This is a blatant misuse of public funds. 'Flybe's precarious situation makes a 
mockery of the promises the airline, its shareholders and Heathrow have made about the expansion of regional 
flights if a third runway is built.' Ryanair said of the rescue: 'We have already called for more robust and frequent 
stress tests on financially weak airlines and tour operators so the taxpayer does not have to bail them out.' 
Environmental campaigners also criticised the deal, particularly over the deferral of APD, and urged Mr Shapps to 
boost rail travel following the government's review of regional connectivity and domestic APD levels. Friends of the 
Earth aviation campaigner, Jenny Bates, said: 'Any review of APD that leads to cheaper air travel and more 
polluting flights, would be a complete scandal - and rip apart Boris Johnson's pledge to show leadership on the 
climate crisis.' Greenpeace UK policy director, Dr Doug Parr, demanded APD remained when he said: 'The 
government cannot claim to be a global leader on tackling the climate emergency one day, then making the most 
BA owner leads the complaints with EU over taxpayers' Flybe rescue
carbon-intensive kind of travel cheaper the next. The Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom explains why Flybe was 
given taxpayer aid while others have been refused financial help.'Cutting the cost of domestic flights while allowing 
train fares to rise is the exact opposite of what we need if we're to cut climate-wrecking emissions from transport.' 
Chancellor Sajid Javid said of the deal on Tuesday: 'I welcome Flybe's confirmation that they will continue to 
operate as normal, safeguarding jobs in UK and ensuring flights continue to serve communities across the whole of 
the UK. 'The reviews we are announcing today will help level up our economy. 'They will ensure that regional 
connections not only continue but flourish in the years to come - so that every nation and region can fulfil its 
potential.' Read more: BA owner leads the complaints with EU over taxpayers' Flybe rescue[1] [ 1]:

Jan 08, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
American Airlines AAL[1], with 24 Boeing 737 MAX jets in its fleet, inked a deal with the manufacturer of the planes 
— The Boeing Company BA[2] — pertaining to compensation for losses due to the grounding of the planes since 
March 2019. American Airlines aims to share part of the compensation with its workers under the company's profit-
sharing scheme.Alaska Air Group ALK[3] — the parent company of Alaska Airlines —also featured in the headlines 
when its long-serving chief financial officer (CFO) Brandon Pedersen announced his intention to retire on Mar 2, 
2020. Pedersen was the company's outside auditor for 11 years prior to joining it in 2003 as the vice president of 
finance and controller. He was promoted to his current position in May 2010.Meanwhile, Latin American carrier, 
Azul AZUL[4] and European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] reported year-over-year increase in their respective 
traffic numbers for December mainly backed by strong demand for air travel. Furthermore, United Airlines UAL[6] 
announced that it will not operate flights connecting the Dayton International Airport and George Bush 
Intercontinental Airport in Houston, TX.(Read the lastAirline Stock Rounduphere[7])Recap of the Past Week's Most 
Important Stories 1. American Airlines, which expects the Boeing 737 MAX jets in its fleet to be grounded through 
Apr 7, 2020, will reportedly share $30 million[8] of the compensation it would receive from Boeing, with employees. 
The payment is likely to be made this March, under its profit-sharing scheme. Notably, American Airlines is not the 
only U.S.-based carrier which will receive compensation from Boeing due to losses related to the Max grounding. 
Southwest Airlines LUV[9], which enjoys the largest exposure to Boeing 737 MAX jets among U.S. carriers with 34 
such jets in its fleet, also inked a deal with the plane manufacturer last month for partial compensation for losses 
due to the groundings. However, details of the deal remain undisclosed. Some other 737 MAX customers, including 
Turkish Airlines, too have signed deals with Boeing seeking compensation for losses.2. During Pedersen's tenure 
as CFO, Alaska Air Group acquired Virgin America, thereby expanding its presence significantly, particularly on the 
West Coast. Pederson will be replaced by Shane Tackett, who currently serves as the company's executive vice 
president of planning and strategy. Tackett has served Alaska Air Group in multiple capacities ever since joining it 
in 2000. (Read more:Alaska Air Group Picks New CFO, Incumbent to Retire[10]).3. At Ryanair, December traffic 
(including 0.5 million from its LaudaMotion unit in Austria) was up 9% year over year to 11.2 million. However, load 
factor (% of seats filled with passengers) remained unaltered at 95%. Moreover, the company's CEO Michael 
O'Leary reportedly [11]stated that the carrier is unlikely to receive its first 737 MAX delivery from Boeing before

October 2020. (Read more: Ryanair's December Traffic Rises 9% Amid 737 MAX Uncertainty[12]).4. At Azul, 
consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger kilometers) increased 27.2% year over year to 2.96 billion, 
owing to 25.7% growth on the domestic front and 31.1% rise, internationally. On a year-over-year basis, 
consolidated capacity (measured in available seat kilometers/ASKs) expanded 26.5% to 3.54 billion, driven by a 
24.3% expansion in domestic capacity and a 32.8% increase in international capacity. (Read more: Azul's Traffic 
...ad Factor Increase in December[13]).5. Due to lacklusterdemand on the Dayton-Houston route, United Airlines 
has decided to discontinue operations on the same from Mar 29, 2020. Notably, the carrier has been operating non-
stop flights on the route from June 2018. Nevertheless, United Airlines will continue to serve Dayton from its hubs in 
Chicago, Denver and Washington, DC. (Read more: United Airlines to Cease Dayton-George Bush Airport 
Service[14]).6.According to a report released by the U.K.-based aviation data firm — OAG —Delta Air LinesDAL[15] 
has emerged as the most punctual among leading U.S. carriers in 2019. Per OAG's annual Punctuality League 
report, the on-time performance rating of this Atlanta, GA-based Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) carrier was 83.56% over the 
past 12 months.(Read more: Delta Most Punctual in 2019 Among Leading U.S. Carriers[16]).You can seethe 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[17].Price Performance The following table shows 
the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the past six months.The table above 
shows that majority of the airline stocks traded in the red over the past week, due to the flaring up of oil prices 
following the U.S. drone strike near the Baghdad international airport that killed Iran's top commander General 
Qassim Soleimani. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 3.2% over the past week. Over the 
course of six months, the sector tracker has decreased 2.1%.What's Next in the Airline Space?Delta is scheduled 
to release its fourth-quarter 2019 earnings report on Jan 14, thereby kickstarting the airlines earnings season.The 
Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast 
through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but 
that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best

Jan 07, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The year 2019 has been 
a disappointing one for Boeing's BA[1] commercial business, which received a severe blow after its best-selling 737 
Max planes were grounded in March, following two crashes claiming 346 lives. A production rate cut for these jets 
announced last April followed by the eventual suspension of production in December came as another jolt.The 
unfavorable turn out of events kept Boeing under immense pressure, affecting the airlines industry as well. This is 
because when more than 700 of Boeing's 737 Max planes were grounded worldwide last March, airlines with a 
large number of 737 Max jets in their fleet started to incur significant losses.Will Airlines Recover the Losses?
Per a report by U.K.-based flight data information firm OAG, Boeing's 737 Max grounding is estimated to have hurt 
global airline industry revenues by $4.1 billion in 2019, including a cumulative loss of $600 million of three U.S. 
airlines.Since the actual numbers of 2019 have not been released so far, we are yet to ascertain how far the 
estimation is appropriate. Nevertheless, Boeing's airline customers have demanded a compensation to recover the 
losses they have been incurring since the 737 Max grounding.To this end, it is imperative to mention that last July 
Boeing took a $4.9-billion charge into account for paying the compensation. Moreover, the company has designated 
$6.1 billion to pay airliners through a combination of cash, discounts and other benefits, per a report by The Wall 
Street Journal.Once Boeing starts paying these compensations, we may expect the affected airline stocks to 
gradually benefit, over time.3 US-Based Airlines to Receive CompensationSouthwest Airlines LUV[2], which 
currently is the biggest customer of the 737 MAX aircraft, is entitled to receive a compensation for some of the 
financial damages incurred owing to the grounding. Although the terms of the agreement have been kept under 
wraps, we expect Boeing to cough up a heavy sum to the Dallas-based airliner.American Airlines Group AAL[3] has 
also entered into a confidential agreement with Boeing in January, wherein it will receive compensation for several 
years. American Airlines has however disclosed plan of distributing more than $30 million of the money among its 
employees via its 2019 profit-sharing program.Per a report by Reuters, United Airlines UAL[4] has extended 
cancellations of Boeing 737 MAX flights from early March until June 2020. United Airlines is yet to reveal how much 
the 737 MAX grounding has costed the carrier, but we may expect the compensation to be a huge one.Other Airline 
Companies Seeking CompensationPer a report published by Simple Flying, carries such as Ryanair, AeroMexico, 
Icelandair and Norwegian Airlines seem to be progressing with the compensation discussions with Boeing.Recently, 
Boeing agreed to pay damages to Turkish Airlines for losses caused by the grounded and undelivered Boeing 737 
Max aircraft. Per Turkey's Hurriyet newspaper, the total compensation Turkish Airlines would receive amounts to 
Boeing Set to Pay Hefty Compensations to Airline Companies
$225 million.As Boeing will soon release its fourth quarterly and full-year 2019 financial results, we expect to get an 
idea of the extent of damage these compensation charges have had on its results.Just Released: Zacks' 7 Best

Ryanair 's December Traffic Rises 9% Amid 737 MAX Uncertainty
Ryanair's December Traffic Rises 9% Amid 737 MAX Uncertainty

Jan 06, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted impressive December 2019 traffic figures, primarily owing to solid air-travel demand. Traffic 
(including 0.5 million from its LaudaMotion unit in Austria) was up 9% year over year to 11.2 million in the 
month.However, load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) remained unaltered at 95%. This European low-cost 
carrier's passenger growth, excluding traffic from LaudaMotion unit, was 7% in the month. On a rolling annual basis, 
total traffic increased 9% to 152.4 million.In fact, robust growth in passenger traffic has been hugely responsible for 
Ryanair's shares having an impressive run on the bourses lately. 
In the past six months, shares of this Irish carrier have gained in excess of 32% compared with itsindustry[2]'s mere 
1% growth.The impressive traffic report is a further positive for this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. You can 
seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[3].Despite the impressive stock-price movement backed 
by strong demand for air travel, Ryanair is not bereft of headwinds. Notably, the company has been suffering due to 
the prolonged grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets. In fact, these planes have been grounded since March 2019 
following the twin air crashes in different parts of the world, over a span of five months, apparently due to software 
malfunctioning. These woes are unlikely to be resolved any time soon as can be made out from the commentary of 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary. According to a Reuters report[4], O'Leary has noted that Ryanair is unlikely to 
receive its first 737 MAX delivery from Boeing before this October.In fact, delivery delays are pushing up non-fuel 
costs, thereby hurting Ryanair's bottom line. Evidently, non-fuel unit costs are projected to flare up 2% in fiscal 2020 
(ending Mar 31, 2020), primarily due to delivery delays of the Boeing 737 MAX planes.Ryanair is not the only carrier 
to be suffering due to the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets. Its U.S. counterparts — Southwest Airlines LUV[5], 
American Airlines AAL[6] and United Airlines UAL[7] — have been equally affected by the issue. With no clarity 
available as to when the jets would resume flying, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines 
currently expect the Boeing 737 MAX jets in their respective fleets to remain grounded through Apr 7, Apr 13, and 
Jun 4, 2020, respectively.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all

Jan 04, 2020( The Armenian Observer: http://ditord.com Delivered by Newstex)  Zvartnots International Airport's 
yearly passenger flow exceeded 3,000,000 for the first time in its history, Armenpress[1] news agency reports. In 
2018, the passenger flow was 2,690,000. Ryanair opens flights to Athens and Thessaloniki  Meanwhile, on January 
3rd Ryanair budget airline announced[2] new twice weekly routes from Gyumri to Athens and from Yerevan to 
Thessaloniki. 
The flights will start in May 2020 and the tickets are already on sale in Ryanair's mobile app. The Irish carrier 
Ryanair had announced back in October that it will start flying to Yerevan from Milan, Rome and Berlin in January 
and that it will open two more routes in summer. Wizz Air annouces flights to Vienna and Vilnius  In another 
welcome news, the Budapest-based budget airline Wizz Air announced[3] last month that it will open flights to 
Yerevan from Vienna and Vilnius in April. Decreasing cost of airfare and Revazian The high cost of airfare has long 
been cited as one of main obstacles for the development of tourism in Armenia. The cost of air travel has been 
decreasing for several years now, as consecutive Armenian governments have prioritized the issue.  Tatevik 
Revazian as the Chair of Civil Aviation Committee  With the appointment of Tatevik Revazian as the Chair of Civil 
Aviation Committee, things have taken a truly revolutionary turn. The young official, who was initially seen as 
inexperienced and lacking necessary skills to deliver, has since managed to attract two major European budget 
airlines to Armenia and has since become something of a hero, for being able to make promises and deliver.Hence, 
her Facebook post[4] on January 3rd, announcing Ryanair's new flights as well as outlining possible new routs to 
Paris (Transavia), Memmingen (Ryanair) and Riga (Air Baltic), no longer seem far fetched, but rather as something 
that can and will be delivered. [ 1]: https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1000488.html [ 2]:

customer experience by providing a smooth, secure and efficient access to ports at Searsport, ME, and to Saint 
John, New Brunswick, via Eastern Maine Railway Company (EMRY) and New Brunswick Southern Railway

generate significant earnings growth. In fact, the company's operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of 
revenues), a key measure of efficiency, has been improving over the last several quarters owing to its cost-control

Jan 02, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  United Airlines Holdings 
Inc UAL[1] will suspend[2] its nonstop flights between Dayton International Airport (DAY) and George Bush 
Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, TX, with effect from Mar 29, 2020. The termination of the service is due to 
weak demand on the route. Notably, the carrier began service to IAH in June 2018.Nevertheless, United Airlines will 
continue to serve Dayton from its hubs in Chicago, Denver and Washington, DC.The carrier, which has 14 Boeing 
737 MAX jets in their fleet, recently extended the grounding period of the MAX aircraft to Jun 4 (from previously the 
aircraft was grounded through Mar 4). As uncertainty lingers over the controversial aircraft's return to service. 
Consequently, the airline expects to cancel approximately 56 flights a day in January and February. 
As air-travel demand usually picks up in the subsequent months, flight cancellations at United Airlines are expected 
to rise to 80 in March and April as well as 108 in May and early June.Numerous flight cancellations due to 
groundings and the consequent revenue loss have weighed on the company's shares. Thanks to these factors, the 
stock significantly underperformed its industry in a year's time. While the stock gained a mere 4.7%, the industry[3] 
rose 12.4%.Zacks Rank ...y PicksUnited Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the

Dec 30, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Norfolk 
Southern Corporation NSC[1] have surged more than 30% in 2019 compared with the industry[2]'s 28.6% 
rally.Reasons Behind the Price RiseThe company's operations are benefiting significantly from the implementation 
of the precision scheduled railroading operating plan, TOP21. Network efficiency of the Merchandise unit improved 
greatly owing to reduced circuity, train miles and train start following the implementation of the first phase of the 
new operating model. The execution of the second phase is currently underway.Norfolk Southern's measures to 
streamline operations by cutting costs are also paying off. Evidently, the company's operating ratio (operating 
expenses as a percentage of revenues) improved in each of the three quarters of 2019. It anticipates this key metric 
to show an improvement in 2019, over 65.4% achieved in 2018. Additionally, the company aims for a full-year 
operating ratio of 60% by 2021.Further, a robust free cash flow generation ($1.5 billion generated in the first nine 
months of 2019) enabled the company to frequently reward its shareholders. 
In the first nine months of 2019, the company returned $2.3 billion to its shareholders through dividends ($705 
million) and buybacks ($1,595 million). Norfolk Southern hiked its dividend payout twice in 2019.What's in Store for 
2020?Going into 2020, the company will continue to witness impressive bottom-line growth owing to its cost-cutting 
measures. The easing trade tensions (phase one trade deal reached between the United States and China) add to 
the positivity.However, there are a few setbacks that might linger into 2020. The company's automotive sub-group 
(part of its merchandise division) is witnessing declining volumes due to decelerating vehicle production in the 
United States and the scenario is unlikely to change drastically any time soon. Persistent below-par performance of 
other key components of the merchandise segment, such as forest and consumer plus metals and construction, 
might drag into next year. Additionally, contracting coal and intermodal volumes might weigh on the company's 
growth prospects in 2020.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 earnings has been revised 4.7% 
downward over the past 90 days.Zacks Rank ...y PicksNorfolk Southern carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some 
better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation[3] sector are Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. HA[4], Ryanair Holdings 
plc RYAAY[5] and GATX Corporation GATX[6]. While Hawaiian Holdings and Ryanair Holdings sport a Zacks Rank 
#1 (Strong Buy), GATX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
stocks here[7].Shares of Hawaiian Holdings, Ryanair Holdings and GATX have gained more than 12%, 21% and 
19%, respectively, in a year's time.Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is 
projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases. They're

Dec 30, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Recently, we issued an 
updated research report on Union Pacific Corporation UNP[1]. The company is witnessing sluggish overall volumes 
(measured by total revenue carload) due to weakness in key divisions. Due to weak volumes, freight revenues, 
which account for a bulk of its top line, are declining. Notably, freight revenues were down 4% in the first nine 
months of 2019.The same is likely to affect Union Pacific's fourth-quarter results, scheduled to be released on Jan 
23, 2020. In fact, the company issued a drab forecast for overall volumes at the Credit Suisse 7thAnnual Industrial 
Conference in December, thanks to headwinds ranging from trade tensions to economic slowdown.The company's 
chief financial officer, Robert Knight, stated that overall volumes for the fourth quarter of 2019 are expected to 
decrease a little more than 10% on a year-over-year basis. 
At the same conference, Union Pacific stated that the top line for the December quarter is anticipated to decline by 
a similar percentage as volumes.Moreover, its high debt levels are concerning. Notably, the debt/EBITDA ratio 
(adjusted) increased to 2.6 as of Sep 30, 2019, from 2.3 at 2018-end. Additionally, the massive capex might be a 
spoilsport.Due to the above-mentioned headwinds, shares of Union Pacific have underperformed the S...00 index 
over the past six months. The stock has gained 5.8%, while the index appreciated 9.8% in the same time 
frame.Estimate Revisions ...cks RankDownward estimate revisions highlight the pessimism surrounding the stock. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2020 earnings has been revised 1.7% downward over the past 60 
days.Given this bleak backdrop, Union Pacific's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is well justified.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors 
interested in the Zacks Transportation[2] sector can consider Hawaiian Holdings HA[3], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] 
and GATX Corporation GATX[5]. While Hawaiian Holdings and Ryanair Holdings sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy), GATX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks 
here[6].Shares of Hawaiian Holdings, Ryanair Holdings and GATX have gained more than 12%, 21% and 19%, 
respectively, in a year's time.Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is 
projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases. They're 
also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases.Zacks has just

Dec 27, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  United Parcel Service, 
Inc. UPS[1] expects yet another record-setting National Returns Day on the back of significant rise in online 
shopping during the holiday season.The company anticipates to receive a record 1.9 million returns packages into 
its network on Jan 2, the National Returns Day. The figure representing a 26% increase from that recorded a year 
ago will create a record for the seventh consecutive year.Given the rapid growth in online shopping, e-commerce 
sales have reportedly touched a record high[2] this holiday season. 
Per Mastercard's data, e-commerce sales jumped 18.8% year over year in the period between Nov 1 and Dec 24, 
2019.UPS is benefiting immensely from this solid uptick in e-commerce, especially on the domestic front. Evidently, 
the company's U.S. Domestic Package revenues grew 9.8% in the third quarter owing to 9% volume expansion 
across all products. Moreover, UPS anticipates cross-border e-commerce volumes to augment 28% during the 
2019-2021 period.Courtesy of rising package volumes and the company's measures to reward shareholders 
through dividends and buybacks, UPS' shares have rallied more than 23% in a year's time compared with the 
industry[3]'s 12.9% rise.Zacks Rank ...y PicksUPS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in

Dec 26, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Air Lease 
Corporation AL[1] attained a 52-week high of $48.44 during the course of the trading session on Dec 24 before 
retracing a bit to close at $48.36. In fact, this Los Angeles, CA-based aircraft leasing company performed 
impressively in 2019. The stock has soared 60% compared with itsindustry[2]'s 32.4% growth.Let's delve deeper to 
unearth the reasons behind this appreciative share price rally and find out whether there is room for further rally:The 
company benefited from the robust increase in revenues, attributable to rentals of flight equipment in 2019. Notably, 
rental of flight equipment revenues accounts for bulk (96.2% of total revenues in the first nine months of 2019) of 
the top line at Air Lease. In fact, revenues from the segment rose 18.3% in the first nine months of 2019, leading to 
a 19.4% improvement in the company's top line.The company's efforts to expand its fleet are also encouraging. To 
this end, it is constantly adding planes to its fleet and removing the outdated models. Air Lease, which sold five jets 
during third-quarter 2019, had 307 owned aircraft in its fleet, representing a net book value of $18.9 billion, up 20% 
from the 2018-end figure. 
Total fleet size at the end of the third quarter was 737, lower than 758 (including owned fleet of 275) at the end of 
2018.We are also impressed by the company's endeavors to add shareholder value. Its latest investor-friendly 
move came in November 2019 when its board approved a 15.4% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 15 cents per 
share (annualized 60 cents). The current raise marks the 7th payout increase in the company's dividend payment 
history.Air Lease rewarded its shareholders with dividends for 28 consecutive quarters. As investors prefer an 
income-generating stock, a high dividend-yielding one is much coveted. Needless to say that investors are always 
on the lookout for companies, which boast an impressive history of regular and incremental dividend 
payments.Moreover, the airline industry is expected to perform better in 2020 compared with 2019, per a forecast[3] 
by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). This bodes well for Air Lease as its fortunes are tied to the 
said industry.Zacks Rank ...y PicksAir Lease currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the 
Zacks Transportation [4]sector include Hawaiian Holdings HA[5], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] and Seaspan 
Corporation SSW[7], each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks 
#1 Rank stocks here[8].The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has been revised 7.9%, 8.8% and 
15.4% upward for Hawaiian Holdings, Ryanair and Seaspan, respectively.5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand-

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ba-falls-below-budget-airlines-in-passenger-satisfaction-rankings/British 
Airways, once promoted as the 'world's favourite airline', has been named alongside Ryanair as one of the worst in 
the country after slumping close to the foot of an annual passenger league table.The company was beaten by 
budget carriers such as Jet2, Easyjet, Flybe and Wizz Air in a ranking based on travellers' experiences in the past 
12 months. Some passengers vowed not to travel with BA[1] again after a year marked by IT failures and strikes, 
leading to mass flight cancellations. 
The league table, compiled by the consumer group Which? and published today, placed BA in 15th place out of 17 
airlines for the quality of short-haul flights, and 14th out of 15 for long-haul flights.Which? said that it represented a 
rapid fall from grace for the airline, which had been named the best short-haul carrier in the group's 2015 survey. 
The conclusions cap a difficult 12 months for BA. In August thousands of passengers had their plans thrown into 
chaos when the carrier suffered an IT failure, cancelling almost 130 flights and delaying at least 300 more. A month 
later BA was forced to ground 2,325 flights, almost its entire schedule, when pilots staged a two-day walkout 
affecting almost 200,000 passengers. BA has hit back, questioning the accuracy of the study, which was based on 
a survey of 6,535 Which? members. It pointed out that the results for some higher-ranked airlines were heavily 
skewed because only a handful of survey respondents had flown with them this year. It said its own data indicated 
that customer satisfaction scores had increased on the back of BA's 6.5 billion investment in new aircraft, airport 
lounges, food and technology. The Which? study named Ryanair[2] as the worst short-haul carrier overall for the 
sixth year in a row, with only 44 per cent of passengers satisfied with its performance. Passengers criticised the 
'endless add-ons' during the booking process and the 'finicky' luggage requirements with one passenger saying 
they were treated like 'cash cows'. Customers gave the airline the lowest score of one star out of five in most 
categories including boarding, customer service and cabin experience. Vueling, the Spanish budget airline, which is 
owned by the same parent company as BA, was second from bottom with 54 per cent and BA was third on 55 per 
cent. Aurigny Air Services, the Guernsey airline, was top on 82 per cent, followed by the budget carrier Jet2 on 79 
per cent. Among long-haul carriers, American Airlines was named as the worst, scoring 48 per cent, followed by BA 
with 55 per cent. Singapore Airlines was top on 88 per cent. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel magazine, said: 
'Year after year the same culprits continue to sink to new lows yet for many of us there is a choice. You don't have 
to keep booking with an airline that has let you down — or one that you loved for years but has slipped in quality. If 
BA falls below budget airlines in passenger satisfaction rankings
you get a choice and you are flying short-haul, choose Jet2. It is better quality than BA and often has better fares 
than Ryanair. If you are heading to the states, Virgin Atlantic beats BA hands down.' BA said: 'Our own data shows 
customer satisfaction scores have increased, and continue to increase, as we deliver our 6.5 billion investment for 
customers on new aircraft, new food, new lounges and new technology. 'We offer our customers a choice of cabins 
on all our flights, lounges for business-class customers, free food for all long-haul flights and business class for 
short-haul, and we are delighted to be able to offer our customers the most extensive network by any UK airline, 
including newly added destinations to Pittsburgh, Charleston, Osaka and Antalya.' Read more: BA falls below

Borden/Business Insider IPOs and stock market gains made several entrepreneurs billionaires[1] in 2019, but they 
cost other business people their spots in the three-comma club. Several people, including the founders of 
WeWork[2] and SmileDirectClub[3], lost their billionaire status when their IPOs didn't go as planned. Juul[4] 
cofounders Adam Bowen and James Monsees were only billionaires for 10 months. With partial guidance from 
Forbes' March list of people who dropped of its billionaires[5] rankings, Business Insider rounded up 15 individuals 
who lost their billionaire status in the past year. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[6] The only thing more difficult than becoming a billionaire is 
staying one — just ask the 247 people who lost their rankings[7] on the Forbes billionaire list between 2018 and 
2019. Several of those people, including the founders of WeWork[8] and SmileDirectClub[9], lost their billionaire 
status in 2019 when their IPOs didn't go as planned. Others, such as the founders of Forever21[10] and 
RyanAir[11], saw their net worths decline over multiple years amid falling sales. Keep reading to see who dropped 
out of the three-comma club in 2019, listed in order of their exits. Business Insider compiled the list by referencing 
Forbes[12]' list of people who dropped off its billionaire ranking and by referring to Business Insider's ongoing 
billionaires reporting from various sources. For the purposes of this article, we focused on some of the biggest 
names in business, or the people behind some of the best-known companies. The net worths below are accurate as 
of December 2019, or reflect the most recent data available where noted. RyanAir's falling stock price knocked 
CEO Michael O'Leary off Forbes' Billionaires List in March. Alan Crowhurst/Getty ImagesNet worth: less than $1 
billion[13], as of January 2019 O'Leary, 58, served as the CEO of the budget airline since 1994, according to 
Forbes[14]. O'Leary once compared RyanAir's business model to that of Wal-Mart, according toForbes[15], saying 
the airline aims to "pile it high and sell it cheap." Theairline struggled[16] with falling profits, Brexit concerns, the 
Boeing 737 Max grounding, and pilot strikes throughout 2018, sinking the company's shares. Forbes estimated that 
O'Leary was worth $1.1 billion in 2018[17], but RyanAir's declining stock price brought O'Leary's net worth below $1 
billion,The Independent's Samantha McCaughren [18]reported in January. His current net worth is unknown.Four 
heirs to the Barilla pasta fortune also dropped off Forbes' Billionaires List in March. Jean-Marc Giboux/AP Images 
for BarillaNet worth:$1.1 billion each in 2018[19] Siblings Emanuella, Guido, Luca, and Paolo Barilla share an 85% 
stake in the largest pasta company in the world, Forbes[20] reported in 2016. At the time, Forbes[21] estimated that 
the siblings were worth about $1.5 billion each. Guido Barilla serves as the Barilla's chairman, while Luca Barilla

and Paolo Barilla are both vice-chairmen. The pasta company faced a crisis in 2013 when Guido Barilla said in a 
live interview that Barilla would never feature a same-sex couple in its advertisements and that gay customers 
should look for another brand, Bloomberg's Thomas Buckley[22] reported in May. Though Guido Barilla's comments 
only had a marginal effect on Barilla Pasta's bottom line, according to Bloomberg[23], the company has since dealt 
with falling sales in the US as consumers' tastes move away from processed food.Money manager Charles 
Brandes fell off Forbes' Billionaires list in March. WILL RAGOZZINO/Patrick McMullan via Getty ImagesNet 
worth:$1.2 billion in 2018[24] Brandes, 76, built his fortune running Brandes Investment Partners, the San Diego-
based investment management firm he founded in 1974, according to Forbes[25]. At its peak, Brandes had over 
$100 billion under management, but now has only $31 billion, Forbes[26] reported. Brandes left the firm in February 
2018. Brandes derives a large share of his net worth from his stake in the firm, closely tying his net worth to its 
performance.See the rest of the story at Business Insider[27] See Also: Billionaires of the 2010s: From Facebook

Dec 17, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Alaska Air Group, Inc. 
ALK[1] reported disappointing traffic statistics for November. Traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), 
slipped 1.2% to 4.39 billion.On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) rose 
2.3% to 5.4 billion. With traffic declining and capacity increasing, load factor or percentage of seats filled by 
passengers deteriorated 290 basis points (bps) to 81.2%.In the first 11 months of 2019, the carrier generated RPMs 
of 51.13 billion (up 1.9% year over year) and ASMs of 60.94 billion (up 1.8% year over year). With traffic growth 
outpacing capacity expansion, load factor inched up 10 basis points to 83.9%.Alaska Air Group, Inc. Price

price[2] | Alaska Air Group, Inc. Quote[3] Apart from capacity overexpansion woes (load factor declined in October 
as well), the carrier is witnessing some cost pressure due to escalating non-fuel unit costs. Evidently, non-fuel unit 
costs (excluding special items) grew 2.9% in the first nine months of 2019. The same is projected to rise 0.5% year 
over year in the fourth quarter (against the previous expectation of 1.2% decline). For 2019, non-fuel unit costs are 
predicted to increase nearly 2.2%.Zacks Rank ...y PicksAlaska Air Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some

Dec 17, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Copa Holdings, S.A. 
CPA[1] reported disappointing traffic statistics for November. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger 
miles (RPMs), slipped 1.5% to 1.7 billion in the month. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (measured 
in available seat miles/ASMs) dipped 2.9% year over year to 1.99 billion.This fall in capacity and the resultant 
decrease in traffic can be attributed to reduced capacity due to the extended grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX jets. 
The carrier with six Boeing MAX 9 jets in its fleet removed all MAX flights from its schedule through March 2020[2]. 
Consequently, multiple fight cancellations are affecting its revenues.Meanwhile, with traffic declining less than the 
amount of capacity contraction, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved 120 basis points (bps).In the 
first 11 months of 2019, the carrier generated RPMs of 19.49 billion, down 0.9% year over year, and ASMs of 22.99 
billion, down 2.4%. Load factor expanded 130 bps to 84.8% in the period.Copa Holdings, S.A. Price

AAL[1] has extended the grounding period of its Boeing 737 MAX jets through Apr 7, 2020, as talks pertaining to 
the approval for the MAX aircraft's return to service continue between Boeing and the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA). Pointing at several technicalities that need to be addressed, the FAA hinted at the completion 
of the process in 2020.Following the extension of the MAX grounding period, American Airlines is expected to 
cancel approximately 140 flights per day through Apr 6, 2020. The carrier, which has 24 Boeing 737 MAX jets in its 
fleet, previously suspended the MAX flights through Mar 4, 2020. In October, the airline stated that its 2019 pre-tax 
income is likely to be hurt by approximately $540 million due to the flight cancellations from the groundings. 
Reduced capacity as a result of the groundings is weighing on the company's costs.On Dec 22, American Airlines

Dec 10, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, United 
Airlines Holdings UAL[1] grabbed headlines following the news that Scott Kirby will take over as chief executive 
officer (CEO) of the company, replacing incumbent Oscar Munoz next year. Notably, Kirby has been serving United 
Airlines as its president since 2016. He had joined this Chicago-based company from another airline heavyweight 
— American Airlines Group AAL[2].Furthermore, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] slashed its 
summer 2020 traffic growth forecast on account of delivery delays pertaining to Boeing 737 MAX jets. On the traffic 
front, Latin American carriers — Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL[4] and Azul AZUL[5] — reported a decline in 
their respective load factors (% of seats filled by passengers) for November as traffic growth was outpaced by 
capacity expansion.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup here[6])Recap of Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. 
Following United Airlines' Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 20, 2020, Scott Kirby will take charge 
as the carrier's CEO. From May 20, 2020, the current CEO Oscar Munoz will serve as the executive chairman of 
the company's board of directors for a year. 
Also, United Airlines' chairman, Jane Garvey, will retire in May next year. Additionally, Ted Philip, who currently 
chairs the Nominating/Governance Committee, will take charge as the lead independent director on May 20. (Read 
more: Scott Kirby to Take Over as United Airlines' CEO in 2020[7])2. As the Boeing 737 MAX jets have been 
grounded since March 2019, Ryanair has received only 10 such planes instead of the initial plan of 20. 
Consequently, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Irish airline company now expects passenger growth of 156 million for 
fiscal 2021 (ending Mar 31, 2021) compared with 157 million anticipated previously. Further, the carrier plans to 
close two bases in Nuremberg and Stockholm Skavsta due to the unavailability of this aircraft. Ryanair is currently 
in talks with its staff, unions and 'affected airports' to decide on summer capacity cuts at a few other bases as well.

today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[9].3. At GOL Linhas, traffic, measured in revenue passenger 
kilometers (RPK), climbed 3.8% to 3.4 billion in November. While international RPK declined 13.2%, domestic RPK 
grew 6.3% in the month. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (measured in available seat 
kilometers/ASKs) was up 6.4% to 4.21 billion, primarily on 8.9% expansion in domestic capacity. Moreover, the 
carrier witnessed an 8.3% increase in passenger count during November. (Read more: Gol Linhas' November 
Traffic Rises, Load Factor Declines[10])4. At Azul, consolidated traffic increased 30.6% year over year owing to

strong demand for air travel. Traffic increased 30.4% and 31.4% in domestic and international markets, 
respectively. Consolidated capacity expanded 32.5% on a year-over-year basis. The increase in domestic capacity 
was 30.9%. On the international front, capacity rose 38.3%. (Read more: Azul's Traffic Rises But Load Factor 
Declines in November[11]).5. At Hawaiian Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings (HA), 
November traffic increased 4.1% year over year. Meanwhile, capacity expanded 3.6%. Additionally, load factor 
improved 50 basis points (bps) to 84.6% as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion. The carrier transported 
more than 912,000 passengers in November. However, the November passenger count declined 2.7% year over 
year. During the first 11 months of 2019, load factor improved 120 basis points to 86.6%. Passenger count declined 
1% year over year in the January-November period.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of 
the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.The table above shows that the majority 
of the airline stocks traded in the green during the past week. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index increased

Dec 05, 2019( Litigation Futures: http://litigationfutures.com Delivered by Newstex)  Supreme Court: Permission 
grantedThe Supreme Court is to review a controversial ruling that a law firm handling uncontested flight delay 
claims was not conducting litigation and so did not have an equitable lien over the compensation.The Court of 
Appeal's ruling in Bott ... Solicitors v Ryanair[1] was criticised for not giving solicitors credit for being more business-
like and efficient.The case concerned the airline dealing directly with the law firm's clients, including paying them 
compensation.The court said the firm was not conducting litigation when the claims were not contested, and so did 
not have an equitable lien over the compensation. The court said 30% of clients did not pass on the fees due to 
Bott.The Supreme Court has granted permission to appeal. It will consider what the limits are to the principle (as 
espoused in Gavin Edmondson Solicitors Ltd v Haven Insurance Co Ltd [2018] UKSC 21) under which a solicitor 
can ask the court to grant an equitable lien in order to protect his entitlement to fees as against his client.Speaking 
after the appeal court decision, Bott ... senior partner David Bott told Litigation Futures that he was disappointed by 
the decision, as he and counsel felt the firm's situation fell squarely within the parameters of the Edmonson 
ruling.He had also hoped the court would recognise 'the way the law was going' in terms of firms becoming more 
efficient using technology to process matters and said it had taken a lot of investment for claims to be handled in a 
'mechanical and formulaic' way.'If I'd had 100 10-year-qualified solicitors with pens and paper instead, it would not 
have been a problem,' he observed.Mr Bott added that, with 54% of its flight delay claims now being litigated, 'this 
may well be low value [work], but it is not necessarily low complexity or low in argument'.He stressed that the firm's 
business model was not under threat. 
'It will be a nudge on the tiller,' he said, and the firm would amend its processes to make clearer to clients what is 
expected of them when they receive their compensation.Well-known commentator Kerry Underwood, senior partner 
of Underwoods Solicitors, said the senior judiciary[2] needed 'to think through rather more carefully the whole issue 
of access to justice and litigation, and how it may be delivered'.Mr Underwood said: 'At one level, lawyers are being 
encouraged to use portals and follow protocols and do everything to avoid litigation, and yet Bott ... appears to be 
being punished for using such a scheme, and for making significant profits from it.'So, at one level, we are 
consistently urged to be efficient and be a business, with the provision of legal services opened up to every Tom 
Dick and Harry, but when a firm does exactly that, they are punished by the courts by being refused a lien.'I can see 
no logical difference between the pre-action road traffic portal, where 99% of cases are settled, and the scheme 
operated 
by 
Bott 
.... 
This 
decision 
should 
be 
overturned

RYAAY[1] slashed its summer 2020 traffic growth forecast due to delays in receiving the Boeing 737 MAX 
aircraft.As a result of receiving only 10 MAX jets instead of 20 as planned before, the Irish low-cost airline now 
expects passenger growth of 156 million for fiscal 2021 (i.e. year ended 31 Mar, 2021) compared with 157 million 
anticipated previously.Further, the carrier plans to close two bases in Nuremberg and Stockholm Skavsta due to 
unavailability of this aircraft. Ryanair is currently in talks with its staff, unions and 'affected airports' to decide on 
summer capacity cuts at a few other bases as well.Ryanair Holdings PLC Price

available at all for the summer travel period, given the persistent delay in delivery of the grounded aircraft.In 
November, Ryanair hoped to receive 20 planes in March or April 2020 instead of 30 expected initially. 
Due to lesser number of planes, it anticipated passenger growth to slip to 157 million from 162 million expected 
previously.Zacks Rank ...her Key PicksRyanair carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the

Ryanair will stop operating in Nuremberg and Stockholm due to the delayed delivery of the new Boeing 737 Max 
airplanes. The long delays are good news for Boeing's rivals.Budget airline Ryanair announced Wednesday that it 
will be closing bases in Nuremberg and Stockholm. 
The decision was brought about by the delayed delivery of the Boeing 737 Max airplanes.The new model has been 
grounded for months over safety concerns, following the crash of two Boeing 737 Max planes within a few months 
of each other in 2018. In all, 346 people died in the crashes. In a statement, Ryanair said it expects to receive 10 
aircraft rather than the 20 that they originally ordered. Read more: Next time you fly for vacation, buy your right to 
polluteThe airline, known as Europe's busiest, will now expect to serve 156 million passengers next year, around 1 
million fewer passengers than originally projected.Ryanair anticipates reducing summer capacity in other bases as 
well and said it is "in discussions with our people, our unions, and our affected airports to finalize these minor 
reductions."The competition moves inThe 737 Max was supposed to replace many older Boeing models currently in 
use around the globe. But the model has remained on the ground since the 2018 crashes, which were at least 
partially caused by technical failures in the aircraft.An October report by a panel of international aviation experts 
harshly criticized Boeing and the US Federal Aviation Administration for the design and certification of the new 
Boeing model. The delay in clearing the 737 Max for flight has been a headache for many airlines as they seek to 
replace older models in their fleet. United Airlines announced Wednesday that it will replace several older models 
with new models from Boeing rival Airbus.Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

Dec 03, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted impressive November traffic figures primarily owing to a solid demand for air travel. Traffic 
(including 0.5 million from its LaudaMotion unit in Austria) rose 6% year over year to 11 million.However, load factor 
(% of seats filled with passengers) remained unaltered at 96%. This European low-cost carrier's passenger growth, 
excluding traffic from LaudaMotion unit, was 4% in the month. On a rolling annual basis, total traffic increased 9% to 
151.6 million.Despite struggling with low capacity from the grounding of more fuel-efficient B737 MAX jets, the 
carrier's passenger traffic, on the whole, was consistently strong. 
Notably, traffic rose an impressive 11% in the first half of fiscal 2020 (ended Sep 30, 2019), resulting in revenue 
growth year over year.These apart, the carrier's efforts to reward its shareholders through buybacks are 
commendable. Ryanair returned more than €560 million to its shareholders through this investor-friendly measure in 
fiscal 2019. Continuing with the trend, the carrier returned €250 million to its shareholders through buybacks in the 
first half of fiscal 2020. Ryanair's efforts to repay debts apart from expanding its fleet size are encouraging as 
well.The company's initiatives to expand operations are an added positive. Its acquisition of Malta Air — a start-up 
carrier — earlier this year, is an example in this respect. The buyout has strengthened the carrier's foothold in 
Malta. The acquisition also allows Ryanairto operate flights from Malta to non-EU markets (North Africa).Backed by 
these tailwinds, shares of Ryanairhave outperformed its industry[2] on a year-to-date basis. The stock has gained 
15.8% compared with theindustry's 12.1% growth.Zacks Rank ...her Key PicksRyanaircarries a Zacks Rank #2

Solicitors have been advising and assisting Bott ... Solicitors Ltd in relation to this matter.  Bott ... Solicitors Ltd have 
been granted permission to appeal to the Supreme Court by the Supreme Court itself in relation to the issue of 
solicitors' liens where a third party - Ryanair here - deliberately sends damages to the client, and not the solicitor 
acting for the client. Very obviously that acts as a major disincentive to solicitors to take the risk of working on a no-
win, no-fee basis where there will be no fund from which to take the costs. 
It was thought that this issue had been put to bed by the Supreme Court itself in Gavin Edmondson Solicitors Ltd v 
Haven Insurance Company Ltd [2018] UKSC 21[1]  where it held that Haven Insurance must pay to the solicitors 
the costs that were due to the solicitors from their own client in circumstances where the insurance company had 
paid damages direct to the solicitor's client. Any other decision would effectively render the Courts and Legal 
Services Act 1990, with its introduction of Conditional Fee Agreements, useless and remove the major current 
method of providing access to justice, following the removal of legal aid. Here, in Bott ... Solicitors Ltd v Ryanair 
DAC [2019] EWCA Civ 143 [2] the Court of Appeal, in a decision bizarre even by its own recent anti-access to 
justice stance - (see Herbert v HH Law [2019] EWCA Civ 527[3] ) declined to follow the Supreme Court's decision 
in Edmondson, technically distinguishing it on grounds that would cause a first day trainee at my firm to get a 
rollicking. Had Ryanair's conduct been that of a solicitor it would be in clear, repeated and serious breach of the 
Solicitors Code of Conduct specifically indicative behaviour 11.4 which provides that you must ensure that you do 
not communicate with another party when you are aware that the other party has retained a lawyer in a matter, 
except:(a) to request the name and address of the other party's lawyer; or (b) the other party's lawyer consents to 
you communicating with the client; or (c) where there are exceptional circumstances.see my blog - SOLICITORS 
DENIED LIEN; THE RYANAIRCASE[4] After the Unison decision, where again the Supreme Court had to overturn 
an anti-access to justice Court of Appeal decision, this is the most important access to justice matter to go to the 
Supreme Court in recent years. I understand that the Law Society declined to intervene in relation to the Permission 
to Appeal[5] stage. It is to be hoped that the Law Society now takes a different view and intervenes in this matter of 
great importance to all solicitors - and most importantly their clients - whatever type of work is involved. Here is my 
comment on the Court of Appeal decision in this case.  The Senior Judiciary need to think through rather more 
carefully the whole issue of access to justice and litigation and how it may be delivered. At one level, lawyers are 
being encouraged to use portals and follow protocols and do everything to avoid litigation, and yetBott ... 
RYANAIR LIENS CASE GOES TO SUPREME COURT
SolicitorsLimitedappear to be being punished for using such a scheme, and for making significant profits from it. 
What on earth is the relevance to the legal principles of the fact that Bott's income from claims againstRyanairwas 
over 100,000 a month? (see Paragraph 16 of the judgment). What is the relevance of the number of claims that Bott 
were handling, except to show the success of the scheme and the attraction to members of the public? So, at one 
level, we are consistently urged to be efficient and be a business, with the provision of legal services opened up to 
every Tom Dick and Harry, but when a firm does exactly that they are punished by the courts by being refused a 
lien. I can see no logical difference between the pre-action road traffic portal, where 99% of cases are settled, and 
the scheme operated by Bott ... Solicitors Limited. This decision should be overturned by the Supreme Court. I deal 
with the decision of the High Court and the Supreme Court in my blogs - COURT REFUSES TO GRANT

Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images An Air Canada Boeing 787-8 flight had to turn round mid-flight after the crew 
spotted a crack in the windshield. Flight AC857 was due to fly from London to Toronto but was forced to land in 
Dublin, Ireland because of the incident. The flight had already flown beyond Ireland and was over the Atlantic 
Ocean when the crack was spotted, flight data from tracking website FlightRadar24 shows.[1] The passengers were 
all put on a different flight the next day, while the plane was repaired and put back into service, aviation news 
website Simple Flying reported[2]. Other 787 flights have also experienced cracks windshields, forcing the planes to 
land. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[3]. An Air Canada Boeing 787 plane that was flying across the 
Atlantic from London to Toronto had to land in Dublin after its windscreen cracked mid-flight. Flight AC 857 had 
already flown past Ireland and was around one hour into the flight on Saturday when crew noticed the crack, 
aviation news website Simple Flying reported[4]. The plane, a 787-8 model, then turned around and landed in 
Dublin, Ireland's capital, 55 minutes later, according to Simple Flying. Data from flight tracking website 
FlightRadar24[5] shows the plane's abrupt u-turn on finding the crack:The passengers were put on a different 787-8 
plane to continue on to Toronto the following day. Simple Flying reported that the plane with the crack was repaired 
and flown back to Canada after repairs in Dublin. The plane, with a tail number of C-GHQY, is now back in regular 
service, according to the outlet. Other Boeing 787 planes have experienced cracked windshields, including a Jetstar 
Boeing 787-8 plane[6] that was diverted to Melbourne, Australia while en route to Indonesia in September. Boeing 
did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about the Air Canada flight, and the 
broader issue of cracked windscreens on 787 aircraft. The incidents have also previously involved Air Canada. In 
September, a flight from Shanghai to Vancouver[7] was diverted to Tokyo after a crack appeared. Air Canada said 
after that flight that the landing was precautionary because the windows have two panes of glass. Boeing is also 
currently dealing with a separate cracking problem in its 737 plane model,[8]where cracks have appeared on an 
area of some of the planes called the pickle fork, which connects the plane body, wing structure, and landing gear. 
This has led some airlines, like Ryanair[9] and Qantas, to ground some of the planes after they found cracks during 
inspections.NOW WATCH: Here's why in-flight WiFi is so slow and expensive[10]See Also: Boeing quietly unveiled

Nov 26, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
Airlines for America (A4A), the trade organization for leading U.S. airlines, predicted strong demand for air travel 
during the Thanksgiving holiday. Per A4A, 3.7% more passengers will be flying to various destinations in the 12-day 
travel period (Nov 22-Dec 3) this year compared to 2018.Meanwhile, American Airlines AAL[1] grabbed headlines 
by virtue of its decision to launch 20 seasonal routes for next year's summer. As the summer season is historically a 
busy one for airlines, the addition of new routes is expected to attract substantial traffic, and in turn, bolster 
American Airlines' top line.The past week also saw European low-cost carrier Ryanair RYAAY[2] ink a seven-year 
technology partnership with Vodafone Business, which is part of the Vodafone Group. Additionally, JetBlue Airways 
JBLU[3] entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) deal with Morgan Stanley to buy back $160 million 
worth of its stock. 
JetBlue aims to fund the repurchases with its available cash balance.(Read the lastAirline Stock 
Rounduphere[4])Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. According to the forecast put forward by the 
Washington-based trade group, approximately 31.6 million passengers will travel on U.S. airlines during the 
Thanksgiving holiday period this year. The forecast implies that 2.63 million people will take to the skies per day 
compared with 2.55 million fliers per day in the same period last year. Moreover, Dec 1 is likely to be the busiest 
day for carriers ever, with 3.1 million people expected to take to the skies on that day.To meet the surge in travel 
demand, U.S. carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 108,000 per day. In fact, they will be 
operating 859 more flights a day during the period compared to 2018. (Read more: 3 Airline Stocks to Buy on A4A's 
Rosy Thanksgiving Forecast[5])2. As part of its decision to introduce additional routes for the summer of 2020, 
American Airlines intends to launch eight additional domestic routes. These routes will include flights connecting 
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and Portland, Maine using an Airbus 319 aircraft. Flights on the route will 
operate on Saturdays from Jun 4 to Oct 3 next year. Other domestic route additions include flights connecting its 
East Coast hub — Philadelphia to Nantucket, Massachusetts, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts and Traverse 
City, Michigan. All three seasonal flights will be using an Embraer 175 on Saturdays from June, 2020. (Read more: 
American Airlines to Add Routes for Bolstering Summer Service[6])American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7].3. JetBlue has decided 
to accelerate some repurchases as part of its $800 million share buyback program announced in September, 2019. 
Airline Stock Roundup: A4A's Bullish Thanksgiving View, AAL 's Expansion Update More
Per the terms of ASR agreement with Morgan Stanley, the carrier will shell out $160 million and receive roughly 6.9 
million shares initially, based on its Nov 21 closing price. The total number of shares to be received by the carrier 
will be determined by the volume-weighted average prices of the JetBlue stock during the term of the ASR 
agreement. After settlement of the transaction, the carrier will have $640 million of its share buyback authorization 
remaining.4. Strengthening their partnership further, Ryanair chose Vodafone Business as its partner in the field of 
technology communications in Europe. Per the new agreement, Vodafone Business will transform Ryanair's 
information and communication technology infrastructure by applying its cloud, unified communications, software-
defined wide area network (SD-WAN), Internet of Things (IoT) and security services. The UK mobile company will 
manage services like online booking, passenger boarding and in-flight transactions for the Irish carrier in Europe. 
Per the deal, Vodafone Business will support 300 Ryanair sites and roughly 153 million passengers across 40 
countries. The deal should encourage a faster turnaround of planes apart from offering other facilities, which in turn, 
might boost Ryanair's profitability.5. In a bid to boost the travel experience of its passengers, Allegiant Travel 
Company ALGT[8] has collaborated with Twentieth Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios to celebrate an animated spy 
comedy adventure — Spies in Disguise — slated to release on Dec 25, 2019. To this end, Allegiant aims to launch 
a newly-designed aircraft with a Spies in Disguise-themed livery wrapping the exterior. The plane, based at 
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, will feature larger-than-life images of the film's lead characters. 
From Thanksgiving through January, Allegiant's passengers will have opportunities to win prizes and participate in 
contests.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week 
and during the past six months.The table above shows that majority of the airline stocks traded in the red over the 
past week. However, the losses incurred were marginal. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index decreased

group of Danish travel agents and journalists from Jutland helped to christen the inaugural Billund (in Jutland) to 
Dublin, as part of a promotional campaign by Tourism Ireland, Filte Ireland and Ryanair. 
The aim of the visit was to highlight the new Ryanair flight and ease of access to people living in Jutland. The trip 
was also an opportunity to showcase Ireland's tourism offering and some of the things to see and do in Ireland for 
Danish travellers. The journalists will be sharing their experiences, in various online and print publications, to their 
combined audience of around 838,000 readers. The itinerary included Malahide Castle and Gardens, Slane Castle 
and Slane Distillery, Croke Park, the Guinness Storehouse, Glasnevin Cemetery Museum, the Little Museum of 
Dublin and the Museum of Literature Ireland (MoLI). Julie McLaughlin, Tourism Ireland's Manager for the Nordic 
Region, said: 'We were delighted to invite these travel agents and journalists to visit Ireland. It's an opportunity to 
promote the new Ryanair flight from Billund to Dublin, as well as some of our visitor attractions. 'The new Ryanair 
flight between Billund and Dublin is good news for Irish tourism, particularly as we aim to grow tourism business in 
the shoulder and off-season months. We look forward to co-operating with Ryanair to maximise the promotion of 
this new service.'

Nov 20, 2019( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  The 
budget airline's policy is now null and void in Spain following a passenger's complaint. However, Ryanair has 
indicated it may not follow the ruling.A Spanish court on Wednesday ruled Ryanair could no longer charge an extra 
fee for hand luggage in the Iberian country.The court termed it "abusive" after a passenger complained following a 
trip from Madrid to Brussels. 
She then took the airline to court over the incident after airline staff forced her to pay €20 ($22) to bring her 10 
kilogram (22 pound) luggage on board.The court ordered the Dublin-based airline to refund her the €20 plus 
interest, but turned down the passenger's request for an additional €10 in compensation.Read more: Ryanair risks 
loss if Boeing 737 Max remains groundedImmediate changeThe ruling, which cannot be appealed, means the 
budget airline's cabin baggage policy is now null and void and states the airline must "remove it" from its terms and 
conditions.Until now, Ryanair only allows small bags into the cabin if they can be placed under the seat in front, but 
larger bags of up to 10 kilograms incur a fee, or a priority boarding pass which customers must also pay for.In 
November 2018,the Federation of German Consumer Organizations (vzbv) accused Ryanair of providing 
misleading information and insufficient pricing information about its cabin bag policy.Possible flouting of the new 
rulingThe Irish company hinted that it may ignore the Spanish court's decision when it released a statement in 
response saying: "This ruling will not affect Ryanair's baggage policy, as it misquoted the (European Court of 
Justice) and misinterpreted the airlines' commercial freedom to determine the size of their cabin baggage."When 
asked if it was planning to carry on regardless or appeal the ruling in the European Court of Justice, the airline 
declined to comment.jsi/aw (AFP, Reuters)Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/uk-passengers-expose-the-dirtiest-airlines-in-new-survey/Ryanair has been 
named the filthiest flight operator in the UK by passengers, according to a Which? Travel survey.In the survey fewer 
than half of passengers scored the Irish budget airline as good for cleanliness. 
In contrast, the survey found that on average, eight in 10 of passengers rated hygiene positively across 42 airlines. 
But Ryanair customers were unhappy, with a quarter claiming cleanliness on flights was poor. A Which? 
investigator who used an ultraviolet light to examine the cleanliness on a Ryanair flight was greeted by greasy tray 
tables, soiled headrests and dusty window sills upon boarding. Meanwhile, the ultraviolet light showed up stains on 
the tray tables that could not be seen by the naked eye. Rory Boland, Which? Travel editor, said: 'Faster and faster 
turnarounds are one thing but it is unacceptable for some airlines to be cutting corners when it comes to cleaning 
out their cabins properly - no matter how cheap the airline ticket. 'There are steps you can take; either choose your 
next flight on an airline that has a good track record for cleanliness or equip yourself with some antibacterial wipes. 
'If you are flying Ryanair though, a biohazard suit might be more appropriate.' While Ryanair was not the only airline 
to be criticised for its hygiene, it was significantly worse than the other airlines included in the survey. Many 
customers of WizzAir were also less than impressed with its cleaning, with only six in 10 finding the cleanliness to 
be good. The scores were hardly better for those who chose to fly with Vueling or Iberia, with 63% of passengers 
being satisfied with the cleanliness. Around two-thirds of easyJet passengers rated the cleanliness as 'good', 'very 
good' or 'excellent'. British Airways was also in passengers' good books with three in four being pleased with the 
airline's hygiene. Easyjet on the other hand was rated as 'good', 'very good' or 'excellent' for cleanliness Nearly all 
of the passengers who flew with Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Qatar Airways, Cathay Pacific and 
Swiss told Which? that they found the cleanliness on board to be good. Last year, research conducted by 
Marketplace, a Canadian TV show, revealed the grim reality of the various types of bacteria, mould and yeast that 
are on planes. After analysing more than 100 samples collected on 18 domestic Canadian flights, scientists 
discovered that headrests were the most contaminated place on a plane. Offering tips to passengers on how to 
protect themselves, Which? advised washing hands before eating, carrying a hand sanitiser gel and avoiding 
touching your eyes, mouth or nose while on board. Read more: UK passengers expose the dirtiest airlines in new

21.7% in the past month, while it is also above its 20 Day SMA too. This combination of strong price performance

the case, particularly if you consider RYAAY's recent earnings estimate revision activity.

Nov 07, 2019( Week Herald: https://weekherald.com Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) was 
upgraded by Zacks Investment Research[1] from a "hold" rating to a "buy" rating in a research report issued on 
Thursday, Zacks.com[2] reports. The brokerage presently has a $89.00 target price on the transportation 
company's stock. Zacks Investment Research[3]'s price objective suggests a potential upside of 4.62% from the 
stock's current price. 
According to Zacks, "Shares of Ryanair have underperformed its industry in a year due to multiple headwinds such 
as labor unrest, Boeing 737 MAX groundings and high labor costs. Management stated while releasing second-
quarter fiscal 2020 results that the delivery of its first B737-MAX-200 aircraft has been delayed yet again and now it 
expects the jet delivery in March/April 2020. Moreover, weak airfares (down 5% in first-half fiscal 2020) are denting 
the company's profitability. High labor costs are also hurting Ryanair's bottom line. However, the increase in traffic 
bodes well for Ryanair. Notably, an 11% rise in traffic led to 11% growth in revenues in first-half fiscal 2020. 
Initiatives to add shareholder value are encouraging too. Efforts to widen its base are commendable as well. The 
buyout of Malta Air is in line with Ryanair 's plans to expand."Several other equities research analysts have also 
weighed in on RYAAY. ValuEngine[4] upgraded shares of Ryanair from a "sell" rating to a "hold" rating in a report

Nov 07, 2019( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  A whistleblower claims that 
Boeings' 787 Dreamliner could be left without oxygen if the cabin were to suffer a sudden decompression. 
Emergency oxygen systems are supposed to keep passengers and crew alive if the cabin pressurisation fails. 
Without this system, passengers could be incapacitated, fall unconscious, or even sustain brain damage and/or die. 
John Barnett is a former quality control engineer who has worked for the company for 32 years, including in the 
South Carolina plant where the 787 Dreamliner is manufactured. 'Boeing South Carolina is strictly driven by 
schedule and cost,' Barnett claims, suggesting that up to a quarter of the oxygen systems could be faulty but were 
deliberately fitted to planes to save on costs. Barnett discovered the fault in 2015. He claims that under-pressure 
workers even fitted sub-standard parts from scrap bins to aircraft on the production line and- in one case - with the 
knowledge of a senior manager. Boeing denies the allegations of cost-saving at the expense of security. But 
Barnett is taking legal action against Boeing for denigrating his character and forcing him to retire. Boeing denies 
forcing Barnett to retire and argues that it has created a culture that encourages employees to raise concerns and 
rigorous processes to ensure they are listened to. Last week Boeing was forced to ground 50 of its popular 737NG 
planes due to cracks on the haul. Among the worst affected companies are Australia's Qantas and Ireland's 
Ryanair. The firm has also come under intense scrutiny following the Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash in March. 
The view that Boeing prioritized cost-saving over security is echoed by former engineer Adam Dickson, who was 
involved with the development of the 737 Max at Boeing's Renton factory in Washington state. He told the BBC that 
his team had to fight the factory and management to maintain process and quality to standard.

Nov 06, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Multiple airlines 
around the world have grounded Boeing 737 Next Generation planes in recent weeks after the manufacturer 
announced a cracking problem in the planes' pickle forks. The pickle fork is the structure that connects the plane 
body, wing, and landing gear. Ryanair quietly grounded at least three 737NG planes, The Guardian reported[1], 
despite saying last week[2] that it doesn't expect the cracking issue to be a problem for its operations. Ryanair 
appeared to confirm that some planes had been grounded in a statement to Business Insider, saying that it had 
made a "tiny number (less than 5%) of findings" in its planes. 
Ryanair's profits have been affected by Boeing's ongoing crises, which include a worldwide grounding of its 737 
Max jets following two fatal crashes. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] Ryanair has become the 
latest airline to ground the Boeing 737 due to cracks found in the planes, The Guardian reported Wednesday[4]. 
The Irish budget airline grounded at least three Boeing 737 Next Generation (NG) planes due to fissures in the 
"pickle fork," the newspaper's Naaman Zhou reported, referring to a commonly used name for the structure that 
connects the plane body, wing, and landing gear. Multiple airlines have grounded Boeing 737NG planes in recent 
weeks, after Boeing announced the cracking problem in the 737NG, prompting the US Federal Aviation 
Administration to instruct airlines that fly the planes to inspect them[5].Ryanair had not disclosed the cracks or 
grounding until The Guardian published its story. The airline, which has more than 400 737NGs in service, told The 
Irish Times last week[6] that it was unlikely the cracking issue would impact operations or fleet availability. In a 
Wednesday statement to Business Insider, Ryanair appeared to confirm the grounding of three planes, but said it 
would not affect its operating fleet or flight schedules. "This tiny number (less than 5%) of findings would not affect 
either Ryanair's operating fleet or flights, because the airline has moved to its winter schedule from the end of 
October," the statement said, adding that Boeing is currently repairing planes for Ryanair. "Ryanair will continue to 
inspect the remainder of its fleet, in full compliance with the Airworthiness Directive, and we are confident that the 
tiny number of pickle fork cracks, if any, will not affect either Ryanair's fleet, its flights, or its schedules." The 
statement also called The Guardian's report "rubbish" and accused it of an "attempt to misreport the story," but did 
not say what details in the report the company disagrees with. Business Insider has requested clarification from 
Ryanair, but has not heard back from the airline at the time of publication.Up to 50 737NG planes around the world 
Ryanair quietly grounded Boeing 737 planes over 'pickle fork' cracking, becoming the latest airline to act on the 
problem
have been grounded so far, Agence France-Presse reported last week, with Qantas being the last airline to do so 
publicly[7]. Thousands of 737NG planes are in service globally. Experts previously said that the presence of a 
pickle fork crack "does not immediately compromise the safety of the aircraft," Australia's ABC News reported[8]. 
Boeing has not yet responded to Business Insider's request for comment on the cracking issue.Boeing currently 
faces crises on multiple fronts. Its 737 Max planes remain grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes by the 
aircraft within six months of each other, both of which are believed to have been caused by an internal software 
malfunction that employees had previously complained about. A former quality-control engineer has also told the 
BBC, in a report published Wednesday[9], that he found faulty emergency oxygen bottles on the 787 
Dreamliner,[10] but that the company stonewalled his request for further investigations. Ryanair has previously 
warned that its profits might get hammered by Boeing's troubles. In July, the airline said the grounding of the 737 
Max means it might carry fewer passengers and may even closer some of its airport bases[11]. Read more: Boeing

Nov 06, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
SkyWest SKYW[1] and the Latin American carrier Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL[2] reported better-than-
expected third-quarter 2019 earnings per share. However, the picture pertaining to revenues was in contrast for 
both carriers.SkyWest's revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but declined year over year due to the sale 
of ExpressJet Airlines in January 2019. Meanwhile, Gol Linhas' top line missed the consensus mark but improved 
year over year owing to solid demand in the corporate segment and capacity discipline.Meanwhile, profit after tax at 
the European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] was flat year over year at €1.15 billion in the first half of 
fiscal 2020 (ended Sep 30, 2019) with average air fares declining 5%. However, an 11% rise in traffic led to 11% 
growth in revenues during the first six months of fiscal 2020. Moreover, load factor was 96%. Over this period, the 
carrier returned €250 million to its shareholders through buybacks.On the non-earnings front, Delta Air Lines' 
DAL[4] October traffic report was impressive with the system-wide load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) 
increasing 10 basis points to 85.6% as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion.(Read the last Airline Stock 
Roundup here[5]).Recap of Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. SkyWest's third-quarter 2019 earnings of $1.79 
per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.73. Also, the bottom line improved 14% on a year-over-
year basis. 
Results benefited from the company's fleet transition initiatives. Additionally, quarterly revenues of $760.3 million 
beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $754.7 million. This St. George, UT-based carrier reported a 5.8% increase 
in block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) during the quarter under review.(Read more: SkyWest's Q3 
Earnings Beat Estimates, Increase Y/Y[6]).2. Gol Linhas' third-quarter 2019 earnings (excluding 65 cents from non-
recurring items) of 34 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents in the third quarter. 
However, the company reported a loss in the year-ago period. This marks the company's 13th straight quarter of 
positive operating results. But, results were partly affected by 4% depreciation of the Brazilian real against the US 
dollar. Meanwhile, net revenues of $936 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $938.4 million. However, 
passenger revenues accounting for bulk (94.4%) of the top line improved 29.5% on a year-over-year basis. (Read 
more: Gol Linhas Q3 Earnings Top on Solid Passenger Revenues[7]).Gol Linhas carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Sacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8].3. Ryanair's second-quarter 
fiscal 2020 earnings (excluding 18 cents from non-recurring items) of $4.51 per share beat the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate by 51 cents. Moreover, earnings per share and revenues improved 2% and 6.7%, respectively, on a year-
Airline Stock Roundup: Q3 Earnings Beat at SKYW GOL , DAL 's Traffic More
over-year basis.The carrier expects fiscal 2020 traffic to increase 8% to 153 million. Fuel bill and ex-fuel unit costs 
for the period are anticipated to rise €450m and 2%, respectively. The carrier expects fiscal 2020 profit after tax in 
the €800-€900 million range. Ryan air, however, is cautious about any market uncertainty like a 'no deal Brexit'. 
Even though the company has limited visibility in the fare environment for second-half fiscal 2020, the same is likely 
to be slightly better than what was witnessed last winter. Moreover, management stated that the delivery of its first 
B737-MAX-200 aircraft has been delayed yet again and now it expects the jet delivery in March/April 
2020.Meanwhile, Ryanair's October traffic report was excellent with the metric (including 0.6 million from its 
LaudaMotion unit) increasing 5% year over year to 13.5 million. However, the load factor was unaltered at 96%.4. 
At Delta, consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) came in at 19.76 billion, up 5.2% year 
over year owing to 6.2% increase on the domestic front. Consolidated capacity (measured in available seat 
miles/ASMs) expanded 5.1% to 23.09 billion as well on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, Delta's passenger 
count rose 5.8% to 17.51 million in October.Meanwhile, on-time performance (mainline) was 86.6% in the month 
compared with 90% a year ago.5 International Consolidated Airlines Group ICAGY[9], the parent company of British 
Airways and Iberia, announced that it intends to acquire the Spanish airline Air Europa. Air Europa is currently 
owned by Globalia. Per the deal worth $1.12 billion (€1 billion), Iberia will be purchasing the entire airline-related 
segments only from Globalia. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2020, subject to 
government clearance.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over 
the past week and during the past six months.The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the green over 
the past week, resulting in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining 3.2% to $110.9. Over the course of six months,

Nov 04, 2019( ACTmedia News: http://actmedia.eu Delivered by Newstex)  About 180,000 Romanians are affected 
every year by flight cancellations or delays. 
The amount of money they lose annually from the compensation rights for canceled of delayed flights they do not 
request exceeds 35 million euros, according to FlightClaim.ro. 'Every day, 5-6 flights are canceled or delayed in 
Romania daily, which means that about 500 Romanians are affected. Over 1,000 flights with such problems were 
recorded in the last 9 months on Romanian airports. The total value of compensations they are entitled to annually 
exceeds 35-40 million euros,' the press release shows. 'Scared by bureaucracy or difficult procedures, only 10% of 
Romanians faced with flights with problems claim their rights from air companies, while the rest of 90% give up 
requesting compensations of 250, 400 or 600 euros, according to the length of the flight,'FlightClaim.ro 
representatives say, a company registering between 20 and 50 compensation claims from Romanian passengers 
who want to receive their rights from air companies. Since the beginning of the year to the present day, most 
canceled flights were in January, when Romanian airports recorded over 180 flights with at least 3 hour delays or 
were canceled, and in August when 170 flights were delayed or canceled, especially low cost or charter flights. 
Some delayed line flights also led to connection losses and many passengers flying to exotic destinations started 
claiming compensations of 600 euros/person. Most delayed and canceled flights were recorded by Tarom and by 
low cost companies Wizz Air, Ryanair and Blue Air, FlightClaim.ro shows. Destinations with most delays were 
Milan, Madrid, Rome, Larnaca and London.

Nov 05, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate 
ReleaseChicago, IL - November 5, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. 
Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the 
financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Sony Corp. SNE[1], Allstate Corp. 
ALL[2] and Incyte Corp. INCY[3].Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog: Earnings Season Clean-Up: 
Global Week AheadI see a little bit of earnings season clean-up to accomplish in the Global Week Ahead.In the 
U.S., Zacks has 1290 total companies (both large ...all) reporting this week.For the S...00 companies, Disney 
earningswill be a highlight. The company reports its latest results on Thursday, after the market closes: According 
to Zacks, based on 4 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for Q3 is $0.97Investors see a tough quarter 
for its media networks division, with financial pain delivered via its acquisition ofFox assetsInvestors also await 
updates on the eagerly anticipated Disney+ OTT streaming service. They seek to challenge streaming giant Netflix 
and go up against Amazon Prime and Apple's newly launched TV+ service Retailers Under Armour, Tapestry, Coty, 
Ralph Lauren and Capri Holdings also report Q3 earnings, along with Qualcomm, Booking Holdings and 
TripAdvisor.Across the Pond, Marks and Spencer, J. Sainsbury, Associated British Foods and Ryanair report in 
London.To Friday, November 1st, Zacks Research Director Sheraz Mian says 357 of S...00 members (71%) have 
reported Q3 results: Total S...00 earnings were down -1.9%Total S...00 revenues were up +3.6% Note: At Zacks, 
'total earnings' mean 'aggregate net income' for those 357 S...00 members — not mean, median or market-cap 
weighted EPS.We prefer to look at net income as a measure of earnings, not EPS. This removes distorting effects 
from share buybacks on EPS-based growth rates.Next are Reuters' five world market themes, reordered for equity 
traders.(1) U.S. and European Earnings Seasons Show Negative Earnings Results OverallIt's a close call, but for 
the S...00, third 2019 quarter could bring the first quarterly year-over-year earnings decline since 2016.Despite juicy 
beats from heavyweights Apple and Facebook, earnings are expected to have declined -0.8%, according to IBES 
Refinitiv. That's better than earlier forecasts a month ago: a -2.2% decline was predicted.Remember also that Q1 
and Q2 estimates started negative, yet ended positive. So upcoming reports by names such Occidental Petroleum, 
CVS Health, Qualcomm and Walt Disney Co. may well move the needle across the line.No such hope for Europe. 
The STOXX index is seeing the worst quarterly earnings in more than three years, Refinitiv says. It expects Q3 
earnings to drop -8.4%, the biggest quarterly fall since mid-2016.Also, of European companies to report so far, 
59.3% exceeded analyst estimates. The U.S. figure is 75%.(2) Tough to Find U.S. China Trade OptimismAny 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Sony , Allstate and Incyte
optimism that China and the United States will settle their trade differences this month has been doused.And not 
merely because Chile called off the Nov 16-17 Asia-Pacific summit where the first phase of the bilateral Sino-U.S. 
trade deal was to be signed. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has stepped up verbal attacks on China, and 
Beijing is expressing doubts that long-standing issues with Washington can be resolved.With the trade war now 
almost two years old, upcoming data from China, Malaysia and Taiwan should underscore the deterioration in 
global demand. Surveys showing Chinese exports in a slump haven't left much hope for positive 
surprise.Meanwhile, the Communist Party's 4-day plenum has wrapped up, with little visibility on what the plans are 
to tackle the effects of the trade war, food inflation and pro-democracy tensions in Hong Kong.(3) Will the BoE Cut 
Rates on Thursday, or Not?Rate cut or rate rise — that's the question Bank of England-watchers have been 
puzzling over.Bank policymakers have sometimes argued for an interest rate cut to offset Brexit-linked economic 
weakness, and at other times warned a rate rise might be required as currency weakness risks sparking 
inflation.On Thursday, though, the biggest change at the BoE meeting could be the rebranding of the 20-year-old 
Inflation Report as the Monetary Policy Report. That will focus it on forecasts and ad-hoc analysis rather than 
merely reviewing the previous quarter.Policy rates should stay at 0.75%, with little chance that dovish commentary 
from policymakers Michael Saunders and Gertjan Vlieghe will translate into a rate cut vote.But the BoE has been 
edging away from long-term guidance that rates are on an upward path, noting in September that this hinged on 
Brexit and the global economy picking up. Saunders has said since then the BoE cannot wait indefinitely for Brexit 
uncertainty to lift, and that economic slowdown strengthens the case for easing policy.For now, policymakers 
appear happy to sit on their hands, given the Dec. 12 snap election and a new Jan. 31 Brexit deadline. Also, the 
government is promising a spending boost that the BoE estimates will add +0.4% to GDP in the next couple of 
years.On the other hand, if the opposition wins power, Brexit may be delayed or even revoked, reducing the need to 
cut.Some policymakers doubt a rate cut would do much good anyway. Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden fears the 
slowdown is damaging the economy's productive capacity so lower interest rates are more likely to boost inflation 
than lift growth. Brexit and the election will keep the Bank of England playing a waiting game.(4) Is Three Decades 
of Globalization All That We See?Nov. 9 marks 30 years since the Berlin Wall fell - an event many see as the 
starting gun for the latest wave of globalization.It's been three decades of trade and political liberalization and a 
golden age for financial globalization. It was a period when unfettered cross-border investment and booming trade 
pulled hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, MSCI's global equity index almost quadrupled in value and 
world growth rose from the 1990s average of +3.1% to almost +4.0% by 2009.But the globalization wave may have 
crested.The market booms of the late 1990s and 2000s, and the crazy banking excesses they spawned, culminated 
in the 2008 crash — the effects of which still linger. Rising inequality has led to electoral backlashes, bringing us 
Trump and his trade wars, Brexit and a host of populist, illiberal political movements and 'strongmen' — all keen on 
nationalism rather than cross-border cooperation.If that heady 30-year period is indeed ending, should world 
markets be running scared? It's an $80 trillion global GDP question. Is the much-vaunted peace dividend talked 
about in 1990 about to be whipped away? Elections in the United States, Britain and elsewhere may well dictate the 
path from here.(5) South Africa Barely Keeps Investment Grade Credit RatingSouth Africa is going through a 
momentous time — its rugby team put on a scintillating display to win the World Cup for the first time since 2007, 
and its government has escaped losing the investment grade credit rating it has held for almost 20 years.That rating 
has afforded South Africa abundant foreign investment and low borrowing costs. But its membership of that club 
would have ended on Friday if Moody's had decided to join the other two big rating agencies in consigning the 
government's Baa3 rating to 'junk.'An immediate downgrade was possible but unlikely, despite Finance Minister 
Tito Mboweni's recent budget bombshell forecasting a big budget deficit and ballooning debt. Moody's did still opt 
for a negative assessment, but rather put South Africa on CreditWatch negative, a stance that portends a 
downgrade within 90 days, it merely cut the outlook to Negative.Losing investment grade would have raised 
borrowing costs and led to South Africa's ejection from the elite World Government Bond Index (WGBI). Goldman 
Sachs estimates this would trigger around $15 billion in investment outflows.But the outlook downgrade gives South 
Africa up to 18 months to put its house in order. That — and of course a rugby win — were probably what Mboweni 
is hoping for before the weekend and so far his prayers have been answered.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY)

Spain with 177 passengers on board in October 2018 when the plane's Inertial Reference System malfunctioned, 
according to the UK's Air Accident Investigation Branch[2]. The system showed the pilots that they were near the 
North Pole. However, the pilots knew this wasn't true, and continued the flight by controlling the plane manually, the 
report said. A separate GPS system showed the correct position of the plane. The plane's altitude and windshear 
indicators also malfunctioned, according to the report, leading pilots to run through checklists and the plane's 
manuals. The AAIB said the aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, made a safe and "uneventful" landing in Edinburgh using 
manual breaking. The AAIB looked at the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder after the flight. Boeing 
tested the plane, and found "no significant faults or defects were found" after multiple tests. Ultimately, "no specific 
fault or failure could be identified or confirmed" and a simulator of the plane "was unable to replicate the fault that 
occurred in the aircraft." The plane had 1,705 flight hours before the flight.NOW WATCH: Why Tesla's Model 3

Nov 01, 2019( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Boeing is grounding up to 50 of its 
popular 737NG planes due to cracks. That is the second major blow to the US aviation manufacturer that was 
forced to ground the best-selling aircraft in its history, namely the Max 737. The NG is a precursor to 737 MAX, 
which was grounded since the two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Among the worst affected companies 
is Australia's Qantas, which grounded 32 aircraft, which reported cracks on nine of its planes in October. The 
Boeing 737NG is also part of Ryanair's fleet. A Boeing spokesperson on Thursday told AFP that less than 5% of 
1,000 planes had cracks, which were grounded for repair. Australia's Virgin Airways conducted checks on its fleet of 
17 Boeing 737NG finding no cracks. Initially, the US Federal Aviation Administration demanded the grounding for 
checks of all Boeing 737NG planes that hadflown more than 30,000 times.The call found the reaction of the US 
regulator 'completely irresponsible,' noting that a crack does not immediately compromise the safety of the aircraft.

Oct 31, 2019( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  I realize that's a headline only 
an accountant can love, but, well, it's a nice summary of the issue at hand. A change in strategy has been great for 
Norwegian, but it took the airline far too long to realize the rapid growth under founder and previous CEO Bjørn Kjos 
was doomed to fail. Third quarter results are in[1], and they aren't bad now that the strategy has changed. 
They aren't exactly great either, however. That's probably the nicest thing I've said about Norwegian's finances in a 
long time.The July-September quarter in Europe is the peak of the peak, and it better be a good quarter or else. 
This year, it was decent for Norwegian. If airlines like Ryanair and Wizz didn't exist with their stratospheric profit 
margins, Norwegian might look better. Pre-tax earnings were NOK 2.2 billion (~$240 million) on revenue of NOK 
14.4 billion (~$1.6 billion). But there were 'other gains' of NOK 249.9 million (~$27 million) which I removed. That 
gives the airline a third quarter margin of 13.6 percent. This may sound good, but when put into perspective versus 
previous years, it's only the third best in the last five years. Data via Norwegian Investor Relations reports[2] The 
indicators are all pointing in the right direction. Year-over-year yield was up 3 percent with load factor rising 0.7 
points to 91.2 percent. That led to a unit revenue increase of 3 percent despite the 3 percent increase in average 
sector length. (An increase in that usually brings unit revenue down.) This isn't as strong of a gain as we saw in the 
second quarter[3] year-over-year, but this is still good to see.How did Norwegian make this happen? It's simple. 
The airline implemented its new strategy to try to make a profit and stopped growing. Capacity was up only 3 
percent year-over-year. With the exception of 2015 when Norwegian took a breath, this is the most rational growth 
we've seen by this airline. And this is the kind of thing that helps improve revenues. Data via Norwegian Investor 
Relations reports[4]  Ok, so it's not really THAT simple. Norwegian faced strong headwinds in its home market 
where demand has dropped. In fact, in the third quarter, the US surpassed Norway as the number one source of 
revenue for the company. Take a look at this chart. You can see the biggest drops in revenue percentage came 
from Nordic countries (can you say 'flight-shaming'?) along with the UK. Chart via Norwegian 3Q2019 Report[5] It 
also had a unit revenue tailwind here in that it has 18 737 MAX aircraft on the ground with more deliveries being 
delayed. That's one reason beyond even the new strategy that growth was so anemic. This only helps push up 
fares, though according to Norwegian it's a net negative. The airline says for the full year, it will take a NOK 1 billion 
(~$109 million) hit to profits because of the grounding.On the cost side, the news was also quite good. Excluding 
fuel, unit costs dropped a whopping 6 percent. Most staggering is an incredible reduction of 30 percent in 
Norwegian Sees Income Improvement, But The Balance Sheet Problem Looms
maintenance costs over last year. When I see a number like that, I naturally assume that it's due to maintenance 
timing or some other fluke, but Norwegian says it was due to 'cost reductions related to renegotiated contracts.' 
That is some serious negotiation.So what does all this mean? Is Norwegian in great shape now? No, of course not. 
Year-to-date, Norwegian is still in negative territory. Its pre-tax margin excluding other gains is -2.1 percent. And the 
fourth quarter isn't great for anyone in Europe. The airline spent so many years burning furniture to stay afloat that 
its balance sheet is weak. European leisure airline life is like that of a bear. They need to get fat and happy during 
the summer so they can survive through the winter. This result isn't good enough to make that happen without help. 
And with each year that passes, it gets tougher and tougher to survive.That's why Norwegian had to beg its 
bondholders to restructure this year. The airline had $380 million in bonds coming due, and it asked bondholders to 
defer for two years[6] so it could save cash. In exchange, it would pay a premium on the bond, and it would pledge 
its London/Gatwick slots as collateral. The deal is done, but it means Norwegian now has one less thing it can burn 
next time it needs help. Its debt costs also got became more expensive.At this point, it's really a race against time. 
There is a sustainable business somewhere at Norwegian, but it is burdened by years of bad strategy decisions. 
Will the airline be able to make it before it runs out of cash during a dark and dreary winter? This is annual game 
that 
we'll 
continue 
to 
play 
for 
the 
foreseeable 
future.

airline 
Lauda 
has 
announced it is to start a direct service beween Vienna and Shannon Airport in 2020. The airline, owned by 
Ryanair, will commence the route in March 2020 and will operate it twice weekly as a summer service on 
Wednesdays and Saturdays. 
Prices will begin as low as €33.99 one day. This is the second Ireland service announced by Lauda this month, with 
a new route between Knock Airport and Palma de Mallorca also scheduled to begin next March. The new route will 
be very welcome at Shannon Airport, which has lost over 120,000 seats this year due to the grounding of the 
Boeing 737 Max plane and the subsequent scaling back of services by Norwegian and Air Canada. The route was 
secured with the help of measures in Budget 2020 to fund regional airport development. 'This is very positive news 
for Shannon as not alone do we get a scheduled service to one of Europe's most visited cities and a strong inbound 
market for tourists to Ireland, but we are also getting a new carrier on the runway here as well. We have been 
working closely with Lauda and their parent Ryanair, to deliver this service and are looking forward to the airline 
commencing operation in the New Year,' said Andrew Murphy, Managing Director, Shannon Airport. Tourism 
Ireland has welcomed the news. Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: 'Today's announcement is good news 
for tourism to the west coast of Ireland - expanding the options for Austrian holidaymakers to come and experience 
the spectacular Wild Atlantic Way. We look forward to co-operating with Lauda, Shannon Airport and other tourism 
partners, to maximise the promotion of inbound travel on this new service.' Lauda currently operates a fleet of 22 
Airbus A320 aircraft.

Oct 07, 2019( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Airline bankruptcies have created a 
fleet of second-hand aircraft, presenting airlines with a cost-effective opportunity to expand their capacity and lower 
maintenance costs. 2019 appears to be the biggest bankruptcy year for the aviation industry in history. The collapse 
of India's SpiceJet Airways, UK travel group Thomas Cook, Avianca of Brazil, Germania, Flybmi, Slovenia's Adria, 
France's XL and Aigle Azur, means hundreds of planes are up for liquidation. As the entire global fleet of Boeing's 
Max fleet remains grounded and the dollar surges - putting upward pressure on the price of fuel - more companies 
could fall under. Profit margins are squeezed, while stronger carriers move in to snap planes, airport slots, and 
market share from their collapsed rivals. Last week Air France-KLM CEO Ben Smith hailed the process of market 
consolidation through bankruptcies as a process that would eventually benefit the French aviation. Air France 
withdrew a rescue bid for Aigle Azur and XL Airways. For its part, Ryanair that has been hit hard by the MAX 
grounding and is looking to acquire the Airbus A320 previously owned by Thomas Cook. Others could follow.

Oct 03, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shutterstock Some 
airports name themselves after cities which, in reality, they are miles away from. Some of the worst offenders are 
almost 100 miles from their "home" cities. 
Here are the top six. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] A common complaint of travellers 
landing at several airports with London in their names is that they aren't in London at all. London Luton (32 miles,) 
London Southend (37 miles,) and London Stansted (36 miles) have named themselves "London" airports, despite 
all of them being located more than 30 miles from the capital. But there are far worse offenders from around the 
world who take the names of cities they're miles from. Here are the worst six. 6. Stockholm Vsters Airport - 62 miles 
from Stockholm, Sweden. Google MapsStockholm Vsters Airport is 62 miles west of Stockholm, Sweden's capital. 
Stockholm Vsters warns travellers that it wil take them at least 70 minutes to drive into Sweden's capital from the 
arrivals terminal. The airport flies to Spain and London, and is a Ryanair hub.5. Oslo-Torp Airport — 66 miles from 
Oslo, Norway. Google MapsOslo-Torp is 66 miles from Oslo city center. The train to get to the Oslo from the airport 
takes about 1 hours 45 minutes, according to the airport.4. Memmingen (Munich West) — 70 miles from Munich, 
Germany. Google MapsA bus runs from Munich central station to Memmingen Airport, which takes 1 hour and 20 
minutes. Flights from Memmingen go to France, Germany, Italy and Belgium.See the rest of the story at Business

Karpukhin Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has discovered cracks in a vital part of its Boeing 737 Next Generation 
planes that connects the body of the aircraft to its wings, CNN affiliate KOMO first reported[1]. Boeing discovered 
the "cracking issue" in a small number of planes, the company said in a statement. The Federal Aviation 
Administration has ordered operators to inspect the planes for structural cracks. Boeing's website lists more than 
100 airlines as customers of 737 NG planes. 
The 737 Max, which was grounded in March after two fatal plane crashes, is not affected by this issue. Visit 
Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[2] Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has discovered a "cracking issue" in 
a vital part of its Boeing 737 Next Generation planes that connects the body of the aircraft to its wings, Charlie 
Harger at CNN affiliate KOMO first reported[3]. The aircraft piece in question, known as a "pickle fork," helps 
connect the plane's body to its wings. Pickle forks are designed to last the life of the plane, which is usually around 
90,000 or more take offs and landings the publication reported. But, in one instance, Boeing found cracked pickle 
forks in a plane that had logged about 35,000 take offs and landings, according to KOMO. The Federal Aviation 
Administration has ordered operators of 737 NG planes to inspect the aircraft for structural cracks, according to a 
statement shared with Business Insider. Boeing reported the issue to the FAA after it discovered the cracks while 
modifying a "heavily used aircraft," according to the statement. The company found similar cracks in a small 
number of other planes, as well. Boeing said in a statement it has notified operators of the issue, and that the 
planes with cracks are "undergoing modifications." No in-service issues have been reported, the company said. 
Boeing's website lists more than 100 airlines as 737 NG customers, including American Airlines, Delta Airlines, 
EgyptAir, RyanAir, and Southwest Airlines. The 737 NG models include 737-700, 7370-800, and 737-900 aircraft. 
The 737 Max is not affected by the cracking issue, the company said. That model was grounded in March after two 
fatal plane crashes. Read more: The complete history of the 737 Max, Boeing's promising yet problematic

Sep 27, 2019( BANG ShowBiz: http://www.bangshowbiz.com Delivered by Newstex)  Jack Whitehall has been told 
to act "more relatable" to keep his fans on board.The 'Jungle Cruise' actor and comedian is currently on tour, and 
he admitted his own team have told him he needs to appear more down-to-earth to ensure he doesn't alienate any 
o his fans.Speaking during a talk at London's Southbank Centre this week, he's quoted by The Sun newspaper's 
Bizarre column as saying: "I've just started doing a tour and I've been told I need to look more relatable, so I now 
need to lie and pretend that I fly on Ryanair and not boujee airlines."They also told me I need to stop talking about 
Waitrose on stage. They say I talk about Waitrose too much, so now I have to pretend I'm a normal person and 
shop at Lidl."The 30-year-old comic is no stranger to luxury, and he was selected to provide the entertainment for 
Prince Charles' annual staff Christmas Party last year.However, Jack admitted he "absolutely died" on stage in front 
of the 70-year-old royal with none of his material going down well at all.He recalled: "It was an honor to be asked to 
do the Christmas party of Prince Charles... he throws [his staff] a Christmas party each year... and I was the 
entertainment that year. 
It's the weirdest gig ever."I walk out, first thing that's weird is that they're sat in the front row, Charles and Camilla, in 
thrones... Also, don't sit in the front row because that's your get-out-of-jail-free card as a comic, [you pick on the 
front row], you ask them what they do for a living... I can't ask Prince Charles what he does for a living!"[It was a] 
small room, maybe 40 people, all of my material was terrible... I absolutely died."And things only got worse for Jack 
as he overheard the prince suggesting to his wife, Duchess Camilla, that they opt for a very different form of 
entertainment in future.He added: "And the worst bit was, when I was walking off because nobody was applauding, 
it was the worst review I've ever got, I heard Charles turn to Camilla as I was leaving the stage and he went 'I think 
next year we'll try a magician'... There goes the knighthood!"

Blog:Buy These Stocks as Oil Slips to Lowest Since Aramco AttacksOil prices slumped more than 2% on Sep 24, 
touching the lowest level since the attacks on Saudi Arabia's key oil production facilities. 
This has been primarily led by President Trump's disturbing rhetoric in relation to the trade conflict with 
China.Trump accused China of manipulating its currency and stealing intellectual property, in a U.N. speech. He 
specified that he won't accept a "bad deal" in trade talks with China. It's worth pointing out that China is the world's 
largest importer of oil and also the second-largest crude user. The United States, in the meanwhile, is the largest 
consumer of oil.Such developments are working against the oil market, especially, after oil rallied last week 
following a crippling attack on Saudi oil installations. The coordinated drone strikes on key Saudi oil facilities have 
removed nearly 5% of global supplies.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the attack was a 'state-on-
state act of war' by Iran, but the United States is still committed toward finding a diplomatic solution with Iran. U.S. 
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper added that the United States will send troops to Saudi Arabia but that would be 
'defensive in nature.' U.S. treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that 'the United States will continue its 
maximum pressure campaign against Iran's repressive regime, which attempts to achieve its revolutionary agenda 
through regional aggression while squandering the country's oil proceeds.'The coordinated drone strikes affected 
the world's largest oil procession plant. In fact, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that almost 
5.7 million barrels a day of crude oil and gas have been affected.Nonetheless, oil prices extended losses after 
industry data showed unanticipated buildup in U.S. crude stockpiles. The American Petroleum Institute said that 
U.S. crude inventories rose 1.4 million barrels last week, way more than analysts' estimate of 200,000-barrel 
drawdown.But, the drop in crude oil prices has been a blessing for aviation and refinery companies. Here's why —
Aviation, Refiners Poised to GainAviation stocks traditionally have an inverse relationship with the movement of oil 
prices. So, it isn't surprising that shares of aviation firms are rising after the sharp drop in oil. As fuel costs form a 
major part of the operating costs for aviation firms, a rise in oil prices eats into profit margins.Refineries also stand 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: SkyWest, Ryanair, Copa and Global Partners
to gain from the drop in crude oil prices. Refineries buy crude oil as their raw materials. So, refineries' net cash flow 
declines if crude oil prices rise. Meanwhile, their net cash flow increases when crude oil prices fall.4 Solid PicksWe 
have, thus, selected four such stocks from the aforesaid areas that are poised to make the most of the crude oil fall.

Following this considerate move by the pilots, the discount carrier invited BALPA to resume negotiations with the 
company.Earlier in the month, amid Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary's statements on his pilot lay-off (due to 
oversupply) plans and failed strike actions by unions, the BALPA accused the management of threatening pilots 
"with the removal of staff travel benefits and inflated and draconian deductions from salary" in case they participate 
in walkouts.However, O'Leary denied such allegations saying that "it is illegal to blacklist someone for being 
involved" in trade unions. He further added that "it has never happened, but we have been accused of it for around

Headlines from the Proactive UK newsroom.Oilfield services group Enteq (LON:NTQ) says first half revenues will 
be more than 50% higher than the same period last year while underlying profits have more than doubled. Both 
numbers are ahead of management expectations. Passenger numbers at Southend Airport increased by 42% in the 
six months to 31 August 2019, compared to the same period last year said owner Stobart (LON:STOB). Ryanair 
flights started in April, Loganair flights in May and easyJet's growth continued.J Sainsbury (LON:SBRY) is to stop 
selling new mortgages, close between 10-15 supermarkets and 60-70 Argos stores. These actions along with the 
weather will knock 50mln off interim profits but save 500mln over five years. Premier League football club 
Manchester United's revenues hit another record in the year to July in spite of a mediocre season on the pitch. That 
will affect this year with revenues and profits predicted to fall.Savannah Resources (LON:SAV) says that as well as 
lithium, its Mina do Barroso project in Portugal also contains substantial quantities of quartz and feldspar. These 
can be recovered and sold to local ceramic and glass companies.

Sep 25, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
Southwest Airlines LUV[1] issued an upbeat guidance for third-quarter 2019 unit cost growth. According to this 
Dallas-based low-cost carrier, its prudent expense management and the shift of certain cost items from the third to 
the fourth quarter of 2019 were the primary reasons behind the trimmed cost guidance.Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] 
also dominated the headlines following its CEO Michael O'Leary's decision related to Boeing 737 MAX jets in the 
company's fleet. Per O'Leary, this European low-cost carrier might resume flying the currently grounded 737 MAX 
jets by late February or early March next year. Ryanair also stated that its UK-based cabin crew approved a four-
year collective deal.Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines' DAL[3] steady initiatives for expanding its presence globally are 
commendable. 
The company intends to start operating additional flights between the United States and Europe next year. JetBlue 
Airways JBLU[4] took a significant step related to its fleet-modernization initiatives, with its new Airbus A321neo jet 
commencing passenger service officially.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup here[5]).Recap of Past Week's Most 
Important Stories1. Southwest Airlines canceled 600 flights in September due to Hurricane Dorian. However, the 
company does not expect the flight cancellations to significantly hurt its third-quarter 2019 results, scheduled to be 
released on Oct 24. Owing to upbeat demand for air travel and strong passenger yields, the carrier still expects its 
third-quarter operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to increase in the 3-5% range on a year-over-year 
basis.Moreover, non-fuel unit costs are now estimated to increase between 8% and 10% compared with the 9-11% 
uptick anticipated previously. (Read more: Southwest Buoys Hope With Q3 Unit Cost Guidance Cut[6]).2. Ryanair, 
which has been engulfed with labor-related problems for quite a while, received encouraging tidings on the front 
from its pilots and cabin crew in the UK, represented by the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), cancelled 
their plans of going on strike for five days in September. Instead they agreed to resume discussions with the carrier 
on the points of dispute. Furthermore, the carrier's UK-based cabin crew voted overwhelmingly in favor of a pay-
related deal.Furthermore, at its annual general meeting, O'Leary issued an update on the currently grounded 
Boeing 737 MAX jets. Notably, Ryanair is one of Boeing's biggest 737 MAX customers, with 135 firm aircraft orders 
and 75 options. (Read more: Ryanair Hopes to Fly Boeing 737 MAX Next February or March[7]).Ryanair carries a 
Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8].3. As 
part of its efforts to expand in Europe and provide passengers with increased options, Delta aims to operate four 
additional trans-Atlantic flights from Boston next year (transatlantic capacity is expected to be expanded more than 
Airline Stock Roundup: LUV Trims Q3 Cost Guidance, RYAAY , DAL in Focus
30% next year). This will include new seasonal (summer: May 21-Sep 7) service to Rome, the introduction of a 
second daily flight to Paris apart from additional flights to London-Gatwick and Manchester from Boston. (Read 
more: Delta to Introduce More Flights Connecting US ...rope[9]).4. The entry of the first highly fuel-efficient (20% 
increase in fuel efficiency compared with the existing fleet) Airbus A321neo planes into scheduled service might 
enable JetBlue serve new markets as these planes boast a 500 nautical mile increase in range. The first flight was 
from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport 
(FLL). The carrier stated that flights connecting New York JFK to Guayaquil, Ecuador, (scheduled to begin on Dec

jets.Notably, JetBlue placed orders for 85 such jets long back. However, deliveries of the same were delayed due to 
production issues at Airbus. The first of these planes, equipped with modern facilities like a brand-new cabin and 
new in-flight entertainment system, were delivered in late June this year. The A321neo has now started flying 
passengers after test flights were conducted for some time following delivery by Airbus. JetBlue had stated in July

be worth 20 and 40 PlusPoints, respectively. PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the

Sep 24, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  OLI 
SCARFF/AFP/Getty Images Airfare prices for routes previously served by travel company Thomas Cook are 
surging in the wake of its collapse. Travellers found tickets with rival airlines like Jet2, British Airways, Ryanair, and 
TUI to have gone up as much as 400% since Thomas Cook abruptly stopped operations on Monday. The collapse 
left 600,000 people stranded around the world, and many with now-worthless bookings for future flights. Airlines 
responded by saying that their prices are determined by market forces. 
Industry analysts say that increases are the inevitable consequence of a provider collapsing. Visit Business 
Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Airlines are being accused of inflating their flight prices by as much as 
400% after the collapse of UK airline Thomas Cook[2]. Travelers booking flights since the company's collapse on 
Monday say that prices have soared. Thomas Cook ran dozens of flights a day, and its collapse left 600,000 
stranded around the world. Customers with future bookings have found their trips cancelled, and must rebook with 
rival operators if they still want to travel. One traveler said on Monday that the cost of a flight with British budget

common practice in the travel industry, is based on the principle of supply and demand." "As supply reduces, an 
inevitable consequence is that prices increase. However, we are looking at adding more supply (flights and seats) 
to help customers at this time."Read more: Passengers share vacation disasters from the Thomas Cook collapse,

reported on a TUI airline return flight from Scotland to the Canary Islands that increased from 320 to 620. A TUI 
spokesman told Business Insider: "TUI uses a dynamic pricing model which means that our prices can go up or 
down. There are many variables which have to be taken in to account including peak dates of travel, regional airport 
differences and which channel our customers book through." The Sun also reported on a Ryanair flight from 
England to Spain that increased from 113 to 226. Business Insider has contacted Ryanair about increased flight 
prices.Experts say the price increases are inevitableJohn Strickland, an airline analyst at JLS Consulting, told the 
BBC: "People aren't sitting there rubbing their hands with glee. If sales come in rapidly on popular routes then 
prices go up."Jack Sheldon, founder of flight price website Jack's Flight Club, told the UK's Guardian newspaper[12] 
that this always happens. He said: "When a particular route ceases to operate, prices do indeed increase 
substantially, but this generally occurs over a matter of weeks and months. I expect it will be similar in this case as 
the additional demand will increase prices on other carriers." Read more: The UK expects to spend 100 million 
flying back stranded Thomas Cook passengers, which is only 50 million less than bailing out the company[13] Lisa 
Tyndall, a spokeswoman for flight comparison website Skyscanner, told the newspaper: "We typically see prices 
increase for key routes when an airline ceases trading, before reverting back again soon after."Travellers have 
been sharing how the collapse has ruined their plans[14], including people who had expected to fly for their 
weddings. Most people now looking to book new flights are those who have had their future trips ruined. Those who 
booked package holidays through Thomas Cook should eventually get a refund, but this is not the case for those 
who only booked flights through the company.The UK government is flying home the 15o,ooo British people now 
stuck abroad. Thomas Cook's biggest routes were places like Greece, Italy, Turkey, Spain, and the Caribbean. It 
also offers package holidays in the winter, which could mean that winter travel prices are also affected. Read more

regret'.Commenting as the company entered compulsory liquidation[2], Mr Fankhauser also apologised to the firm's

whose journey originated in the UK. 
The aviation authority launched a website[4] where customers can find details on those flights.'Customers currently 
overseas should not travel to the airport until their flight back to the UK has been confirmed on the dedicated

travel firm went out of business on Monday, stranding some 600,000 holidaymakers around the globe and sparking 
the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history involving some 150,000 travelers.At 0725 GMT, rival tour 
operator TUI was up as much as 8.4% at its highest since February, easyJet was up 6.1% and Ryanair was 2.6%

makers and UK/German governments, but takes capacity out and likely will boost shares most exposed to its

was up 8.7% after hitting its highest level since May 21.FTSE small-cap listed On the Beach (OTB.L[12]) was up

Britain's second-largest tour operator could leave 150,000 passengers stranded if it goes under this weekend. After 
failing to finalize a rescue deal with its lenders, the firm has now asked for UK government aid.UK travel firm 
Thomas Cook has asked the British government for financial aid to fend off collapse, British media reported on 
Saturday.The decision to request a state bailout followed a threat by its bankers RBS and Lloyds to pull out of a 900 
million pound (€1 billion, $1.1 billion) recapitalization plan, according to the Financial Times (FT).The country's 
second-largest travel operator has not commented on the reports or whether it could go out of business as early as 
this weekend.Read more: Germany increasingly popular as holiday destinationIf the travel agency goes into 
administration — a form of creditor protection that often precedes bankruptcy — around 150,000 British

II.Impact could be widerIn total, some 600,000 holidaymakers from markets including Germany and Scandinavia 
could be stranded.The firm's collapse would also prompt thousands of job losses; it employs 22,000 staff 
worldwide, including 9,000 in Britain.Thomas Cook has struggled in recent years under intense competition in 
popular destinations, high debt levels and an unusually hot summer in 2018 which reduced last-minute overseas

Sep 20, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per Reuters[1], Ryanair 
Holdings plc RYAAY[2] is expected to start flying the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft next February or early March. The 
company's CEO Michael O'Leary stated, "If it flies in North America this side of Christmas, I think we are pretty 
secure we will be back flying some time (around) end-February/March". Meanwhile, he believes, "The best outlook 
is the first aircraft would come in January. The more realistic outcome: the end of February/March".Before the 
aircraft is certified fit to fly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is required to give its nod on the proposed 
software and training changes by Boeing. Following FAA's review, the aircraft needs to be approved by the 
European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Meanwhile, Ryanair's MAX200 plane needs to be approved 
separately.Ryanair Holdings PLC Price            https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price?icid=chart-RYAAY-
fundamental/price Ryanair Holdings PLC price[3] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[4]Ryanair, being one of Boeing's 
biggest 737 MAX customers with 135 firm aircraft orders and 75 options, has been struggling quite a lot due to 
delivery delays from the aircraft's grounding. 
During fiscal 2020, non-fuel unit costs are projected to inch up 2% due to this headwind among other factors. 
Moreover, with the ongoing grounding issue, the carrier will be flying 30 MAX planes compared with 60 it hoped for 
previously. As a result, the airline trimmed its fiscal 2020 growth forecast to 3% from 7% expected earlier.Thanks to 
the prolonged grounding period, U.S. airlines including the likes of United Airlines UAL[5] and American Airlines 
AAL[6] have suspended the MAX aircraft from their schedules through December. Whereas Southwest Airlines 
LUV[7] has removed the aircraft from its schedule though early January.Ryanair to Lay Off Nearly 700 PilotsDue to 
an excess of 500 pilots, O'Leary announced plans to cut back 700 positions. Meanwhile, the British Airline Pilots 
Association (BALPA) accused the company's management of threatening pilots "with the removal of staff travel 
benefits and inflated and draconian deductions from salary" in case they participate in strikes.However, O'Leary 
denied such allegations saying "it is illegal to blacklist someone for being involved" in trade unions. He further 
added that "it has never happened, but we have been accused of it for around 30 years now."Amid the 
controversies, O'Leary received some encouraging news as Ryanair shareholders approved a bonus scheme that 
could fetch him 100 million euros in five years in case he is able to either double the company's profitability or its 
share price within the time frame. It remains to be seen whether O'Leary succeeds in receiving this massive bonus 
amount given that the company struggles with both the Boeing MAX groundings and persistent labor strife, which 
have significantly hampered the company's operations.Zacks Rank Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You

Sep 14, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Saul Loeb/AFP The 
Boeing 737 was first imagined in 1964, and made its maiden voyage in 1967. In the 55 years since, more than 10 
variants of the 737 have flown, and it's become the best-selling commercial airplane of all-time. Following two fatal 
crashes of the latest model — the 737 Max, caused by a design flaw — we look back at the history of the venerable 
jetliner. As Boeing works to get the grounded 737 Max back in the air, here's a look at the last 55 years of the 737. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. The Boeing 737 has been in the news a lot lately, since two 
fatal crashes involving the latest model of the plane, the 737 Max. 
But even though the Max has been grounded for six months, as Boeing works to fix a dangerous flaw in the 
troubled jet, the sky has continued to be crisscrossed by older models of the 737. In fact, if you've taken a domestic 
commercial flight in the past 50 years — including the last six months — there's a very good chance you were on a 
737 of some sort. That's because Boeing has sold a ton of them. As of August 2019, the planemaker has taken 
orders for 15,155 of them since 1965, when the jetliner was first unveiled. It delivered the 10,000th of these in April 
2018, a (currently-grounded) 737 Max 8 to Southwest Airlines. Despite the missteps and tragic consequences 
surrounding the Max's initial design, the larger 737 family has proved itself as a faithful workhorse for airlines 
around the world, ranging from long-haul carriers like Delta that include the plane as a small part of its fleet, to low-
cost airlines like Ryanair, which uses 737s for its entire fleet. Although the 737 looks likely to fly on for years to 
come, well past its 70th birthday, Boeing will need to prove to its customers that it's fixed the flawed Max and that 
it's learned enough from the episode to prevent it from ever happening again. The rival Airbus A320 family is 
nipping at its heels, with 14,789 orders through August. With Boeing failing to sell a single Max[2]for more than five 
months, as customers wait to see how the company fixes the plane, the need to restore consumer confidence is 
urgent. Here's a closer look at the incredible 54-year history of the Boeing 737. Early design work began on the 
narrow-body 737 in 1964. Boeing was looking to design a 50-60 seat aircraft designed for trips between 50-1,000 
miles. It would be about half the size of Boeing's smallest jet, the 727, which flew up to 1,700 miles. Reuters/Mike 
Segar The plane would be comparable to the Douglas DC-9 (below) and the British Airways Corporation BAC-111. 
AP While the initial design featured a T-tail like the 727 with engines mounted on the fuselage, the lead engineer 
put them on the wings instead, which meant the body could be widened to seat six people across. Thus, the 737-
100 was born. Boeing See the rest of the story at Business Insider[3] See Also: Viking Cruises is trying to set a

ship it's using looks like.[4]Trump's trade war with China is threatening Boeing's crucial sales of larger aircraft,

Sep 03, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
American Airlines AAL[1] and United Airlines UAL[2] extended the grounding period of Boeing 737 Max jets in their 
respective fleets. Currently, American Airlines and United Airlines have 24 and 14 such jets, respectively.A couple 
of updates were also available from Alaska Air Group's ALK[3] wholly-owned subsidiary — Alaska Airlines — in the 
past week. The carrier announced the ratifications [4]of two pay-related labor deals and also issued an update 
related to its expansion on the West Coast. An expansion-related update was available from Delta Air Lines DAL[5] 
as well.European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] too grabbed headlines by virtue of its decision to 
announce a change at the helm of the group's biggest airline, Ryanair DAC. 
The Irish carrier also announced an 8% increase in its August traffic.(Read the Last Airline Stock Roundup 
here[7]).Recap of Past Week's Most Important Stories1. Updates on Boeing 737 MAX jets have been flooding the 
aviation space ever since the deadly Ethiopian Airlines' crash on Mar 10, 2019. In fact, this was the second 
accident involving Boeing 737 MAX jets within a span of five months. The same model had crashed in Indonesia 
during October 2018, killing 189 people.The latest update came from American Airlines that suspended operations 
of its Boeing 737 Max jets until Dec 3, 2019, extending the grounding period from the previously announced Nov 2. 
American Airlines anticipates approximately 140 flights to be canceled per day through Dec 3. Also, United Airlines 
expects 737 MAX jets in its fleet to remain grounded through Dec 19 as opposed to Nov 3, expected earlier. 
Notably, Southwest Airlines LUV[8], which has 34 such jets in its fleet, had announced earlier that it will remove 
Boeing 737 MAX jets from its schedule until Jan 5, 2020. (Read more: American Airlines Extends Boeing 737 MAX 
Grounding Period[9])2. In a bid to expand its presence in the West Coast, Alaska Airlines announced that it aims to 
add eight new routes connecting the 'vibrant Pacific Northwest communities' with California cities like Los Angeles 
and San Francisco. For instance, there will be two daily departures from Spokane to Los Angeles and San 
Francisco each. While some of the above flights (for example, Spokane to Los Angeles) will start operations from 
Jan 7, 2020, most others (for example, Spokane to San Francisco, Missoula to Los Angeles) will take to the skies 
from Mar 19. (Read more: Alaska Airlines to Boost West Coast Presence With New Routes[10])3. To meet the 
surge in demand during the upcoming winter season, Delta intends to ramp up services to popular Caribbean 
destinations from its hubs. To this end, the carrier aims to launch an additional daily flight from Dec 21, 2019, in the 
New York John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK)-Luis Munoz Marin International Airport (SJU) route. Post commencement 
Airline Stock Roundup: AAL UAL Extend 737 MAX Grounding Period, ALK in Focus
of this new service, Delta will offer a total of four daily flights on the same route. (Read more: Delta to Boost 
Caribbean Services From Its Hubs This Winter[11])Delta carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete 
list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[12].4. Ryanair, which operates as a holding group company 
and includes several airlines, stated that highly-experienced Eddie Wilson has replaced Michael O'Leary as chief 
executive officer (CEO) of the group's biggest airline, Ryanair DAC, with immediate effect. Notably, Wilson has 
been associated with the airline for 22 years. O'Leary will, however, continue to function as the group's 
CEO.Additionally, Ryanair's August traffic report was impressive, with the metric (including 0.6 million from its 
LaudaMotion unit) increasing 8% year over year to 14.9 million. However, the load factor remained unaltered at 
97%. The carrier operated more than 81,000 scheduled flights in August.5. Azul's AZUL[13] cargo division — Azul 
Cargo Express — has entered into a new agreement with Mercado Libre, the largest e-commerce company in Latin 
America, for deliveries across Brazil. The two companies have started working together earlier this year. Presently, 
Azul derives 10% of its cargo revenues from Mercado Libre. The company's cargo business is benefiting 
immensely from rapid e-commerce growth. Notably, its cargo revenues increased 44% during the first half of 2019. 
The new deal should further fortify its cargo operations.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement 
of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.The table above shows that all airline 
stocks traded in the green over the past week, resulting in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining 3.8% to $92.89. 
Over the course of six months, the same depreciated 3.5% due to double-digit losses at the likes of Spirit Airlines 
and American Airlines.What's Next in the Airline Space?Investors will look forward to August traffic reports from the 
likes of SkyWest in the coming days. Updates on the impact of Hurricane Dorian on airline operations will also be 
awaited.Legalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than MarijuanaAmericans spend an estimated $150 billion in this 
industry every year more than twice as much as they spend on marijuana.Now that 8 states have fully-legalized it

Aug 27, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
premier trade organization — Airlines for America ('A4A') — issued an upbeat forecast for U.S. carriers. It is 
expected that U.S. airlines will make hay in the Labor Day holiday period (Aug 28 - Sep 3) owing to robust travel 
demand and affordable airfares.Low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] also grabbed headlines by virtue of its 
announcement to close four of its bases in Spain from Jan 8, 2020. The decision has been vehemently opposed by 
the labor union of Spain, Unión Sindical Obrera (USO), as it will cause significant job losses. Meanwhile, Ryanair's 
cabin crew in Spain will go on strike for 10 days in September (1, 2, 6, 8, 13, 15, 20, 22, 27 and 29), following the 
failure of mediation between Ryanair and union leaders.United Airlines Holdings UAL[2] was also in news courtesy 
of its decision to temporarily discontinue operations to two international destinations on account of inadequate 
demand on the routes. Meanwhile, Latin American carrier Azul AZUL[3] provided an expansion-related update in 
the past week.(Read the Last Airline Stock Roundup here[4]).Recap of Past Week's Most Important Stories1. 
According to the forecast put forward by A4A, approximately 17.5 million passengers will travel on U.S. airlines 
during the Labor Day holiday period this year compared with 16.9 million passengers during the same period last 
year. 
The forecast translates into 2.51 million fliers per day during the above-mentioned period.Moreover, this Friday is 
likely to be the busiest day for U.S. carriers in the seven-day period, with 2.98 million people expected to take to the 
skies. In a bid to meet the surge in travel demand, U.S. carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 
109,000 per day. (Read more: 3 Airline Stocks to Buy on A4A's Rosy Labor Day Projection[5])2. According to USO, 
Ryanair's decision to close its bases at Tenerife, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria and Girona might see multiple pilots 
and cabin crew lose their jobs. Delving into details, the union said that 164 jobs in Girona; 156 in Tenerife South; 
110 in Las Palmas, and 82 in Lanzarote are likely to be under threat due to this latest decision.Ryanair has cited 
reasons like overcapacity of pilots and cabin crew due to delays in the delivery of the grounded Boeing 737 MAX 
jets and Brexit-related adverse developments behind its decision to close the four bases. However, the USO did not 
agree with the company's explanation. (Read more: Ryanair to Shut Down 4 Bases in Spain Next Year[6])3. United 
Airlines will reportedly suspend flights connecting Chicago and Hong Kong from Sep 8, 2019. Additionally, it will 
suspend service on the Newark-Buenos Aires route, effective Oct 26. Notably, while Hong Kong is witnessing 
mass-scale political demonstrations that caused the closure of the Hong Kong International Airport earlier in 
August, Argentina is in the middle of an economic turmoil. These issues have resulted in sluggish demand for 
business and leisure travel to those places. (Read more: United Airlines to Suspend Two Global Services on Low

Demand[7])Additionally, United Airlines announced its intention to commence several new international routes apart 
from extending some international services from its hubs in Chicago, Denver, New York/Newark and San 
Francisco. For instance, the Chicago-based carrier will launch service to Curacao from New York/Newark from Dec 
7, 2019. (Read more: United Airlines to Start Global Flights From Multiple Hubs[8])United Airlines carries a Zacks 
Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[9]4. In a bid to 
cater to rising air travel demand, Azul has announced nonstop service from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Belo Horizonte, 
Brazil, from Dec 16, 2019. Once the new service becomes operational, Azul will fly six times a week to the United 
States from the state of Minas Gerais, whose capital is Belo Horizonte. Currently, Azul operates flights connecting 
Belo Horizonte and Orlando.5. According to a Reuters report, low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines' SAVE[10] chief 
executive officer and president Ted Christie stated that this ultra-low-cost carrier is looking to operate larger Boeing 
planes apart from Airbus A321neo jets to drive growth. Currently, the Miramar, FL- based carrier operates an all-
airbus fleet. The carrier's fleet size at the end of 2018 was 128 (31 A319, 60 A320 CEOs, 30 A321 CEOs and 7 
A320 NEOs). The fleet size is expected to continue expanding in the coming days. PerformanceThe following table 
shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.The table 
above shows that all airline stocks, apart from Southwest Airlines LUV[11], traded in the red over the past week

Aug 26, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1], which is at loggerheads with the unions of Spain — the Unión Sindical Obrera (USO) and the 
Independent Airline Passenger Cabin Crew Union (STICPLA) — announced that it will close four of its bases in 
Spain from Jan 8, 2020.Following the closure of the bases at Tenerife, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria and Girona, 
total 512 pilots and cabin crew in Spain might lose their jobs, according to the USO. Giving the breakdown, the 
union added that 164 jobs in Girona; 156 in Tenerife South; 110 in Las Palmas, and 82 in Lanzarote are likely to be 
under threat due to this latest decision.Ryanair has cited reasons like overcapacity of pilots and cabin crew due to 
delays in the delivery of the grounded Boeing 737 MAX jets and Brexit-related adverse developments behind its 
decision to close the four bases. The company also stated that it was opening the process of collective dismissal. 
However, the USO did not agree with the company's explanation.Infuriated by the decision USO's Ryanair 
secretary, Jairo Gonzalo, stated that 'The closures and dismissals announced are not justified and Ryanair will have 
to give explanations to the Spanish labor authorities'. The USO has also accused the low-cost carrier of trying to 
dismantle its Spanish operations while announcing job vacancies elsewhere in its network.Notably, this Irish carrier 
announced the decision while it was in a meeting with the USO regarding the minimum services to be offered 
during the 10 days in September (1, 2, 6, 8, 13, 15, 20, 22, 27 and 29), when Ryanair's cabin crew in Spain will be 
going on strike as mediation between Ryanair and leaders from USO and STICPLA failed.Currently, Ryanair 
functions at 13 bases in Spain and operations at each of them are likely to be hurt if the strike materializes. With the 
situation showing no signs of improvement, we expect investors to remain focussed on updates pertaining to 
Ryanair's crisis with the unions in Spain going forward.Notably, Ryanair has been suffering from labor-related 
problems for quite some time. This is reflected in the company's disappointing price performance. In a year's time, 
the stock has shed 43% of its value compared with its industry[2]'s 13.8% decline.Zacks Rank ...ocks to

British Airways pilots plan to strike over 3 days in September, throwing air travel into chaos ( BA )
British Airways pilots plan to strike over 3 days in September, throwing air

The British Airways pilots union announced that it would go on strike September 9, 10, and 27. Pilots initially voted 
in July to authorize the strike, but continued negotiating with the airline. The strike is unrelated to a similar strike 
vote by Ryanair pilots. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. British Airways' pilots' union has 
announced three dates in September on which pilots are planning a labor walkout. 
The union, the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), confirmed to Business Insider that it would strike on 
September 9, 10, and 27. BALPA members initially voted in late July to authorize the strike, which British Airways 
unsuccessfully attempted to block in court. The union said that 90% of its 4,000 members turned out for the vote, 
and 93% of them voted to authorize a strike. BALPA did not initially announce dates for the strike, saying it would 
continue to try and negotiate with the airline. The union must issue at least two weeks' notice before striking. In a 
statement, BALPA said that negotiations had failed to reach an agreement. "BALPA put forward a number of 
packages that we believe would have resolved this dispute without a strike, and which we could have 
recommended to our members for acceptance prior to strike action," the union said. "BA did not accept any of these 
packages, and it is clear following discussions with members over the last few days that BA's most recent offer will 
not gain the support of anywhere near a majority of its pilots." Read more: 'How f---ing stupid is this?': A hard Brexit 
could upend global air travel thanks to complex rules from 1944[2] The announcement came following a long-
running dispute between the airline and pilots over a pay raise. The airline has recorded high profits in recent 
quarters and issued large dividends to shareholders, and the pilots' union has sought an above-inflation pay raise 
that would include a profit-sharing benefit.  According toThe Guardian[3], the pilots argue that they accepted pay 
cuts when the airline faced a difficult market during the financial crisis, and that they should be able to share in the 
good periods as well. The airline previously said it offered a 11.5% raise over three years, which the union rejected. 
"In what is British Airways' centenary year, this will be the very first time its pilots will go on strike," BALPA said in its 
statement. "They do so as a last resort and with enormous frustration at the way the business is now being run." 
UK-based pilots from low-cost-carrier Ryanair have also announced[4] plans to strike in an unrelated dispute. The 
union previously announced that it would strike from August 22-24 — which it postponed — and September 2-

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-passengers-face-disruption-as-48-hour-strike-over-pay-
starts/Thousands of Ryanair passengers could face disruption as a two-day strike by UK pilots gets under way.On 
Wednesday, the airline lost a legal challenge in the High Court to block the strike, which is part of a dispute over 
pay and conditions. 
Ryanair has said it will aim to minimise disruption for passengers and will be able to run its 'full schedule of flights'. 
However, it said it could not rule out some delays. The airline said it had drafted in pilots from elsewhere in Europe 
to fill in during strike action. Ryanair said it would inform passengers of any changes to their flights by email and text 
message. 'If you have not received any SMS or email from us, your flight is scheduled to operate,' it said. 
Customers can also check its website[1], it said. Another 48-hour walkout is planned by the union to coincide with 
the end of the summer holidays[2]. On Wednesday, Ryanair won a legal challenge to stop its Ireland-based pilots 
from striking, but more of its pilots fly from the UK. In early August, Ryanair's pilots in the UK joined pilots in Ireland 
in voting to strike over pay and conditions. The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) announced two 48-hour 
walkouts, one from 22-23 August and another from 2-4 September. But Ryanair turned to the courts in London and 
Dublin in an attempt to block the industrial action, prompting Balpa to accuse the airline of 'bully boy' tactics.Read

Aug 20, 2019( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  Only a dozen airlines will 
eventually share the aviation market for major international routes, predicts Lufthansa's CEO, while a possible 
future economic crisis could "accelerate" a consolidation in air travel."The sector is evolving towards a dozen 
companies operating worldwide" on major international routes, in addition to smaller national or regional airlines, 
Lufthansa boss Carsten Spohr told reporters late Monday.Without naming them, Spohr forecast there would be 
"three in the United States, three in China, three in the Gulf and three in Europe".The Lufthansa chief executive 
warned that any future economic crisis could hit European airlines particularly hard, but predicted a downturn could 
"accelerate" mergers and acquisitions."If there is one positive aspect to the flattening of the global economy, and 
certainly also the worsening figures for all airlines -- unfortunately also for us -- it is that the consolidation process 
will tend to accelerate," Spohr added.The recent bankruptcies of German low-cost airlines Air Berlin and Germania 
have enabled Lufthansa to buy back flight routes and aircraft.The airline industry is "much more cyclical" and at the 
mercy of economic developments than others, Spohr said, with the sector suffering from international trade 
tensions.Lufthansa wants to "and will play an active role" in any future consolidation in the sector, said the airline 
boss, whose company's net profit dropped by 70 percent in the second quarter.Spohr said Lufthansa faced strong 
competition from low-cost airlines in a "unique price war", however "we will not be driven out of our domestic 
market" by low-cost companies like Ryanair, because the German airline "has the financial strength to resist" 
competition.

Aug 17, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Nick Morrish/Rachel 
Hosie/Business Insider British Airways' business class offering was described in a recent study[1] as being like 
"Ryanair but with free food," but is this really true? It's safe to say the experience differs wildly depending on 
whether you're flying long or short-haul. I realized this when I experienced the new long-haul business class service 
followed by the short-haul the next day on a British Airways press trip. 
Is it really worth paying to fly business class on a two-hour flight? Here's how the long- and short-haul services 
differ. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[2]. Things haven't been plain sailing for British Airways[3] 
of late. Despite the airline celebrating its centenary this year (complete with a visit from Her Majesty), becoming the 
third carrier to use ginormous A350 planes, and unveiling swanky new business class Club Suites[4], it's had to 
weather some storms. Read more: I flew business class for the first time on British Airways' new A350, and the 
cocoon-like privacy impressed me far more than the food or the lounge[5] If pilot strikes[6] and cabins filling with 
smoke[7] weren't enough, BA's business class offering has just been slated in a study by consumer group 
Which?[8]. Which? described the airline's business class service as akin to "Ryanair but with free food," although 
it's unclear whether the long-haul or short-haul service was reviewed. Ryanair is a famously low-cost UK airline 
where customers have to pay for a number of add-ons — food included. Read more:I flew American Airlines 
international business class for the first time. Here are the things that surprised me.[9] The airline's business class 
or "Club" offering varies wildly depending on whether you're traveling short-haul within Europe (Club Europe) or 
long-haul (Club World). This was hammered home to me particularly clearly when I had the privilege of flying on a 
British Airways press trip to Madrid as a taster flight to launch BA's new Club World seat, and then a flight back in a 
standard Club Europe seat. Here's how the two compare. I hadn't realized that flying business class on a short-haul 
flight actually doesn't mean different seats from economy ... Rachel Hosie/Business Insider ... it just means there'll 
be no one sitting in the middle seat, but a little table instead. Rachel Hosie/Business Insider It was nice not to have

While some people insist on avoiding certain airlines, or feel nervous about flying on unfamiliar foreign carriers, that 
could be a big mistake. Despite reputations for stinginess with things like bags or seat size, plenty of low-cost 
carriers offer phenomenal service considering their incredibly low prices, as long as you pay attention when booking 
and know exactly what you're getting. Similarly, lesser-known foreign airlines often offer great ways to see the world 
comfortably, in a safe and cost-effective way. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Here are 14 airlines that I think are consistently underrated 
based on my own travels, conversations with other travelers, and a ton of discussions[2] online. Southwest Airlines 
Stephen M. Keller/Southwest Airlines promoSouthwest has a reputation for being a more basic airline, but features 
like no change fees, two free checked bags, and reasonably comfortable seats and amenities are a big 
plus.Norwegian Air Norwegian Norwegian Air Shuttle offers unbundled fares between the US and Europe. With 
round trip tickets sometimes available in the roughly $200 range, it's a perfectly comfortable, incredibly cost-
effective way to get to London, Paris, or other cities. Just make sure to read the terms carefully to know what is and 
isn't included.  Ryanair AP Photo/Shawn PogatchnikRyanair gets a bad rap, but the ultra-low-cost-carrier is 
perfectly serviceable for the incredibly cheap flights it offers throughout Europe.See the rest of the story at Business

Aug 08, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Wolfgang 
Rattay/Reuters Pilots from Ryanair have voted to strike, with their union announcing two strike periods: August 22 
to 23, and September 2 to 4. British Airways pilots have also voted to strike, but have not announced dates yet. The 
two strikes — combined with possible action by over 4,000 employees at London's Heathrow Airport — could add 
up to chaos for anyone traveling to, from, or through the UK in the coming weeks. Visit Business Insider's 
homepage for more stories[1]. Ryanair's British pilots union voted have voted to strike later this month in a dispute 
with the airline over working conditions, the union representing them said. 
The union, the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), announced dates for two strikes — one from August 22 to 
August 24, and another from September 2 through September 4. According to a statement by BALPA, it has had 
difficulty negotiating with the airline, partly as a result of Ryanair's unwillingness to recognize unions until only 2017. 
The union said its grievance covers issues "including pensions; loss of license insurance; maternity benefits; 
allowances; and a fair, transparent, and consistent pay structure." The decision to strike comes several weeks after 
a similar decision by British Airways (BA) pilots, also represented by BALPA. That strike, the airline unsuccessfully 
attempted to block through court action, is over a pay dispute. Pilots are demanding a pay increase to reflect BA's 
parent company, IAG, earning consistently high profits over recent quarters, arguing that when the airline previously 
faced financial difficulties, the pilots were willing to accept pay cuts. The airline has offered an 11.5% increase over 
three years, which the union rejected. Read more: British Airways' pilots just voted to strike, which could mean 
major disruptions for summer travel[2] British Airways' pilots have not announced dates for the strikes yet, and the 
union is continuing to negotiate with the airline. BALPA is required to issue notice two weeks in advance of any 
strike. It was not clear whether BALPA would try and coordinate the strikes for maximum impact, or issue them on 
separate dates to minimize disruption. "We have had no formal offer from Ryanair and it is imperative that we 
resolve this dispute urgently to avoid strike action," said Brian Strutton, BALPA's general secretary. "No pilot wants 
to spoil the public's travel plans but at the moment it seems we have no choice." Ground staff at London's Heathrow 
airport have also had strikes scheduled for two weekends in August. The first strike was called off after the airport 
offered wage increases, but strikes are still possible the weekend of August 22 — the same as the Ryanair strikes 
— if staff reject the offer. Ryanair did not immediately explain what passengers affected by the strikes can do to 
change flights. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO, recently announced 900 pilot and flight attendant job cuts[3] for 
this fall and winter as a result of challenges caused by the global Boeing 737 Max grounding, the increased 
likelihood of a no-deal Brexit, and lower fares combined with weaker demand in the UK.NOW WATCH: Will Boeing

Aug 06, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
SkyWest SKYW[1] and Hawaiian Airlines' parent company Hawaiian Holdings HA[2] reported better-than-expected 
earnings and revenues in the second quarter of 2019. While SkyWest's quarterly earnings improved year over year 
driven by its fleet transition efforts, its revenues declined due to the sale of ExpressJet Airlines in January 
2019.Hawaiian Holdings' top and bottom lines declined year over year. The carrier's second-quarter performance 
with respect to operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) was also 
disappointing. This underperformance can be attributed to increased competition at the company's primary market, 
Hawaii, following Southwest Airlines' LUV[3] entry. What is worse is the below-par RASM view issued by the 
Honolulu County, HI-based carrier for third-quarter 2019. Additionally, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[4] reported lackluster results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 (ended Jun 30, 2019) due to declining air 
fares and high costs.On the non-earnings front, Delta Air Lines' DAL[5] July traffic report was impressive with the 
system-wide load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) increasing 140 basis points to 90% as traffic growth 
outweighed capacity expansion.(Read the last Airline Stock Rounduphere[6]).Recap of Past Week's Most Important 
Stories1. SkyWest's second-quarter 2019 earnings of $1.71 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
$1.60. The bottom line also improved 19.6% on a year-over-year basis. 
Results benefited from the company's fleet transition initiatives. Notably, SkyWest has added 25 new E175 aircraft 
and 11 new CRJ900 aircraft to its fleet since the second quarter of 2018.Quarterly revenues came in at $744.38 
million, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $732.97 million. SkyWest's efforts to modernize its fleet and 
streamline operations are added positives. The company aims to reduce the 50-seat jets from its fleet and add new 
E175 aircraft. The carrier reported a 7.7% increase in block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) during the 
quarter under review. (Read more: SkyWest Q2 Earnings Beat on Fleet Transition Efforts[7])SkyWest carries a 
Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8].2. 
Hawaiian Holdings' second-quarter 2019 earnings (excluding 2 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.23 per share 
outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04. However, the bottom line declined 14.6% year over year. 
Although quarterly revenues of $712.2 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $707.5 million, the 
metric dipped marginally year over year. RASM decreased 3.1% in the reported quarter.Airline traffic, measured in 
revenue passenger miles, inched up 3.6% year over year to 4.49 billion in the quarter under review. Capacity or 
available seat miles (ASMs) expanded 2.7% to 5.15 billion. Load factor improved 80 basis points to 87.1% in the 
quarter. (Read more: Hawaiian Holdings Q2 Earnings Beat, Q3 RASM View Dull[9])3. Ryanair's profit after tax in 
Airline Stock Roundup: Q2 Earnings Beat at SKYW HA, DAL 's Traffic Report More
first-quarter fiscal 2020 declined 21% year over year to €243 million. Results were hurt by a 6% decline average 
fares to €36. Weakness in Germany and the UK contributed to the decline. What's worse, the carrier stated that 
sluggishness in air fares is likely to persist in the first half of fiscal 2020. Notably, the metric is anticipated to register 
a decline of 6%. High costs (labor and fuel) too impacted the company's first-quarter fiscal 2020 results. The top 
line, however, increased 11% to €2.3 billion on the back of an 11% rise in traffic to 42 million. In the meantime, the 
load factor was flat at 96%. Ryanair still expects fiscal 2020 profit after tax in the €750-€950 million range, flat year 
over year.In another bleak development, the carrier stated that it now expects only 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets to be 
delivered on time for the summer of fiscal 2020 compared with the previous expectation of 58. As a result of the 
delay in delivery, Ryanair does not predict any cost savings associated with these jets until fiscal 2021.Meanwhile, 
Ryanair's July traffic report was impressive, with the metric (including 0.6 million from its LaudaMotion unit) 
increasing 9% year over year to 14.8 million. However, the load factor remained unaltered at 97%.4. Gol Linhas 
Aereas Inteligentes' GOL[10] second-quarter 2019 earnings (excluding 39 cents from non-recurring items) of 11 
cents per share matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company incurred a loss in the year-ago period. 
Results were partly affected by an 8.8% depreciation of the Brazilian real against the US dollar and high fuel 
costs.Meanwhile, net revenues came in at $801.1 million (R$3.14 billion), which surpassed the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of $702.4 million and increased year over year. The year-over-year top-line improvement can be attributed 
to solid demand in the Corporate segment and capacity discipline. (Read more: Gol Linhas Q2 Earnings Meet, 
Revenues Top Estimates[11])5. At Delta, consolidated traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — 
came in at 23.77 billion, up 5.2% year over year. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) expanded 
3.5% to 26.41 billion on a year-over-year basis. Notably, Delta's passenger count rose 6.3% to 19.4 million in July.

pcruciatti/Shutterstock A photo of an EasyJet passenger flying in a backless seat went viral and caused outrage on 
Tuesday. However, the airline says the image was misleading as the seats were out of order and nobody used 
them. A photo showing a woman in one of the seats, on a flight from London to Geneva, was posted to Twitter by 
tech startup CEO Matthew Harris. 
EasyJet spokeswoman Katie Kershaw told Business Insider: "No passengers were permitted to sit in these seats as 
they were inoperative awaiting repair." Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] A viral photo showing 
an EasyJet passenger in a row of seats with their backs removed is misleading, the airline has said. An image, 
posted by tech startup CEO Matthew Harris on Tuesday, showed a woman using a seat on flight EZY98HD from 
London's Luton Airport to Geneva, Switzerland. He asked "How can this be allowed?" In a response to questions by 
Business Insider, EasyJet said that the seats were not in use and were awaiting repair. All passengers used seats 
with functional backs, a spokeswoman said. The flight was not fully booked, and had five free seats, an airline 
source said.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1158638099121037315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw #easyjet[2]

Here's Why Ryanair ( RYAAY ) is Down Since Q1 Earnings Release
Here's Why Ryanair (RYAAY) is Down Since Q1 Earnings Release

Aug 06, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ever since Ryanair 
Holdings' RYAAY[1] first-quarter fiscal 2020 (ended Jun 30, 2019) earnings released on Jul 29, its shares have 
decreased 5.5%, despite the company reporting better-than-expected results. The company's earnings of $1.20 per 
share (€0.21) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14. However, the bottom line declined year over year due 
to low air fares and high costs. Meanwhile, revenues increased year over year to $2.6 billion (€2.3 billion), which 
was also marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. 
The top line benefited from rise in traffic.Results in DetailRyanair's first-quarter fiscal 2020 profits saw a drop of 
21% to €243 million on account of 6% fall in average air fares and 19% increase in costs (fuel costs jumped 24%). 
Unit costs excluding fuel rose 4% due to consolidation of the LaudaMotion unit and higher labor costs among other 
factors.Meanwhile, traffic during the quarter ascended 11% to 42 million while load factor was flat at 96%. The 
carrier returned approximately €100 million to shareholders during the reported quarter.As of Jun 30, 2019, capital 
expenditures totaled €389.6 million. Net debt at the end of the quarter was reduced to €419.3 million from €449.5 
million as of Mar 31, 2019.Fiscal 2020 OutlookThe company still anticipates fiscal 2020 profit after tax (PAT) to be 
flat year over year within €750-€950 million. Meanwhile, fares are expected to be approximately 6% lower in the 
second half of the year. Based on this, fiscal 2020 air fares are estimated to either decline up to 2% or increase up 
to 1%. Additionally, traffic is now predicted to increase 7% to more than 152 million, down from an 8% climb, 
anticipated previously. The downside is due to delivery delays from the Boeing MAX groundings. Fuel costs are 
anticipated to escalate by €450 million while non-fuel unit costs are expected to inch up 2%.This overall 
disappointing performance and the bleak fiscal 2020 outlook caused the company's shares to dive.Zacks Rank ...y 
PicksRyanair carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Delta Air 
Lines DAL[2], Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL[3] and JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU[4], each sporting a 
Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[5].Shares of 
Delta, Gol Linhas and JetBlue have rallied more than 15%, 51% and 17%, respectively, so far this year.The Hottest 
Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through 
the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should 
still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play

Believe It Or Not, Legroom On Airplanes Is About To Get Even Worse

Aug 05, 2019( Phil's Stock World: http://www.philstockworld.com Delivered by Newstex)  Courtesy of ZeroHedge[1]. 
View original post here[2]. Just when you thought flying coach couldn't get anymore uncomfortable - and that airline 
companies couldn't find a way to squeezeone more dollarout of each flight - Cebu Air in the Philippines says it plans 
on cramming a record 460 seats on some of its new A330 planes, according to Bloomberg[3]. Cebu is moving 
kitchens and bathrooms on the plane to accomplish the task. The 460 seats are 20 more than the plane's current 
maximum. Mathieu De Marchi, a Bangkok-based consultant at Landrum and Brown said:'It's all a matter of 
squeezing as many passengers as they can. It's only going to get worse over the next decade.' 
https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/leg.png?itok=qxOF2u8RAnd despite the protests of unhappy 
customers, packing more people onto flights has been a key to turning around the airline industry in recent years. In 
Asia, the strategy is the 'bread and butter for low cost carriers' that serve a continent where 100 million people fly 
for the first time every year. The demand coming out of Asia has led to shortages in everything from pilots to 
mechanics to airports to runways. Airlines do everything they can to avoid buying new aircraft and having to pay for 
extra landing rights at airports. AirAsia is buying larger planes to deal with the problem. The budget airline said in 
June it was changing an order for hundreds of aircraft to larger models that carry 50 more people and are capable 
of flying 600 miles further. Other airlines are simply 'bolting in more chairs,' like RyanAir. RyanAir led this charge in 
2014 when they ordered new high density jets from Boeing with 8 more seats each than normal. Cathay Pacific 
airlines started cramming an extra seat into each economy row in its Boeing 777-300′s in 2017.            
https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/leg%202.png?itok=cGh73do5This cost the passengers about 1 
inch of person space each. And so less legroom is now the norm. Rows in economy were about 34 inches apart in 
the early 2000′s. Now, they're about 30 to 31 inches. 28 inches can even be found on short flights. The size of seats 
has narrowed, also, from about 18.5 inches to 17 inches on average. Often times, air rage occurs in economy class, 
where a lack of personal space can make people feel trapped and contentious. Janet Bednarek, an aviation 
historian at the University of Dayton, Ohio, said: 'Smaller seats are less controversial in Asia, partly because Asians 
tend to have slighter builds than Americans or Europeans.Where people are smaller on average it is not as big an 
issue. Many people are willing to put up with discomfort in exchange for low-price tickets.'            
https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/leg%203.png?itok=Bihhov5xIn 
addition 
to 
personal 
space 
shrinking, prices have also come down. For instance, some international flights now cost less than half of what they 
did a decade ago, as competition from low cost carriers has forced all airlines to adapt, and charge for many items 
that were once free - including space. For instance, a one way ticket from Shanghai to Manila can be less than 
$100 on Cebu Air. But the seats you'll get are only 16.5 inches wide. Cebu placed a $6.8 billion order for Airbus jets 
Believe It Or Not, Legroom On Airplanes Is About To Get Even Worse
in June that includes 16 higher capacity A330neos. Airbus says the plane is made to fit 260 to 300 passengers. For 
bare-bones 
economy, 
Cebu 
will 
look 
to 
seat 
as 
many 
as 
460.

Jul 31, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Wolfgang 
Rattay/Reuters Low-cost airline Ryanair[1] — Europe's largest airline — announced that it would cut 900 pilot and 
flight attendant jobs this year. The announcement comes following a rough second quarter for the airline, which saw 
profits drop 21%. Ryanair faced several challenges stemming from the global Boeing[2] 737 Max grounding, the 
increasing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit, and lower fares combined with weaker demand in the UK and overcapacity 
in Germany. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[3]. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary warned staff on 
Wednesday that imminent job cuts are "unavoidable" as the airline suffered a number of setbacks this year. The 
airline said that it expected to lay off 900 flight crew employees beginning this fall, including around 500 pilots and 
400 flight attendants. 
O'Leary also warned of planned service cuts, including the possibility of closed bases. "It's been a challenging 
summer," O'Leary said, "[and] we're facing into a very difficult winter." The announcement, delivered by O'Leary in a 
video message to Ryanair employees, part of which was posted by Sky[4], came in the same week that the airline 
reported a fall in revenue, including a 21% drop in quarterly profits, amid several convergent headwinds faced by 
the airline in the first half of 2019. Ryanair has 135 Boeing 737 Max aircraft on order, with the first five scheduled to 
be delivered this autumn. However, as the plane's grounding drags on, the airline faces capacity uncertainty, having 
planed its routes assuming the new plane's reliability. The inability to replace older aircraft with the more efficient 
737 Max has also driven up fuel consumption and associated costs. Read more: Boeing says it could suspend 737 
Max production if grounding continues, putting tens of thousands of jobs at risk[5] While the airline expected to take 
delivery of 58 Max aircraft by summer 2020, it now expects "at best" 30 deliveries, O'Leary said in the video. 
O'Leary also noted "higher staff costs, largely because of the big pilot and cabin crew pay increases we negotiated 
last year," based on revenue forecasts that the airline ultimately missed. Additionally, fewer pilots and flight 
attendants are quitting to take other jobs, meaning staff reductions through attrition are not possible.The increasing 
likelihood of a "no-deal Brexit," pushed for by new UK prime minister Boris Johnson, also contributed to concerns, 
O'Leary said. "We're worried this could have quite a damaging effect, particularly on our UK bases and on some of 
our Irish bases, which are heavily dependent on people traveling between Ireland and the UK." Ryanair warned in 
its quarterly earnings report that it could reduce or eliminate its Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Belfast routes in the event 
of a no-deal Brexit. O'Leary also cited tight competition in Germany, along with increasing fuel prices, as 
contributing to the drop. Read more: Southwest plans to stop flying from Newark Airport and is yanking the 737 Max 
Ryanair says it will cut 900 pilot and flight attendant jobs because of Brexit concerns and the Boeing 737 Max 
grounding
from its schedule until 2020[6] "I'm sorry to advise you that this means that we have to cut our aircraft numbers and 
our staffing, not just for summer 2020, but also in winter 2019," he said in the video, according to RTE[7]. "This will 
result in some base cuts, some base closures, and I'm very sorry to say, some job losses this winter for pilots and 
cabin crew." According to The Guardian[8], O'Leary agreed to take a 50% pay cut as well. His 1 million euro 
($1,112,400) salary will be reduced to 500,000 euros ($556,200), and his maximum bonus, currently also 1 million 
euros, will max out at 500,000 euros. However, he could still earn nearly 100 million euros ($111,266,000) if the 
airline performs above expectations over the next five years based on stock awards. O'Leary said that details of the 
job cuts and base closures would be announced in late-August. The airline had an average of 14,000 flight staff 
during the first quarter of this year.NOW WATCH: Inside Roborace: the Formula One for self-driving cars[9]See

Jul 31, 2019( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  The CEO 
of Europe's largest low-budget airline has said around 1,500 flight crew jobs are redundant. Sinking profits and 
reduced deliveries of Boeing's grounded 737 MAX aircraft have hampered Ryanair's expansion plans.Ryanair will 
be cutting jobs over the next year, as delivery delays on Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and sinking profits have hit the 
budget airline's expansion plans.In an internal video seen and verified by Bloomberg news on Wednesday, 
Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, told the airline's employees that it currently employs 500 more pilots 
than needed, along with 400 too-many flight attendants.O'Leary also said that 600 additional jobs that Ryanair had 
planned for next summer will no longer be needed, as the airline expects to have fewer aircraft.Read more: Ryanair 
suffers first profit slump in 5 years"We over the next couple of weeks will be doing our very best to minimize job 
losses, but some are unavoidable at this time," O'Leary said in the video, which was released internally to Ryanair 
employees on Monday.O'Leary added that Ryanair would be cutting the number of airports that it flies to, and that 
these base cuts would be finalized in August. The job cuts at the Dublin-based airline would kick in around the end 
September and again after Christmas.In its second-quarter earnings report released Monday, Ryanair announced a 
21% drop in profits compared to the same quarter in 2018. O'Leary said in the video the profit loss was due to lower 
fares, higher fuel costs and higher staff costs due to pay increases.Workers' rightsAs a budget carrier, Ryanair has 
been criticized for lagging on workers' rights, with employees and unions demanding fair pay and working 
conditions. 
Several disputes in recent years with employee unions have resulted in strikes and disruptive cancellations. A spate 
of cancellations in late 2017 were followed by disputes with employees across Europe in 2018. Ryanair has 
previously refused to recognize workers' groups, but it has been forced to reach agreements with various trade 
unions in Europe. Read more: Easyjet, Thomas Cook and Ryanair — Brexit's effect on tourism's big namesIn 
September 2018, Ryanair cabin crews in Germany, Belgium, Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy, as well as 
pilots in Germany, served Ryanair notice of a 24-hour walkout over better pay and conditions.In December 2018, 
Ryanair had to strike a deal with the German pilot union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) over wages, benefits and 
working conditions, as well as Germany-based staff being covered by German labor law, and not Irish labor law. 
Reuters news agency reported Wednesday that Ryanair pilots in Britain and Ireland were considering industrial 
action after the job cuts were announced. Unnamed union officials said that O'Leary was trying to deter them from 
voting to carrying out a strike.Take it to the Max Ryanair's ills are also connected to Boeing's grounded 737 MAX 
aircraft, which Ryanair is depending on as a new plane to cope with expanding passenger numbers and 
routes.Regulators worldwide grounded Boeing's 737 Max planes in the wake of the March 2019 Ethiopian Airlines 
crash, which left 157 people dead. That accident followed a similar Lion Air jet crash in Indonesia last October that 
Ryanair CEO Micheal O'Leary says job cuts are coming
killed all 189 people on board. An anti-stall system on the aircraft is believed to be partly to blame for the accidents. 
Earlier in July, O'Leary said that Boeing told Ryanair that it expects the 737 MAX jets to be back in the air by the 
end of September. Read more: Boeing's 737 Max grounded for longer after new flaw discoveredRyanair said in its 
annual report released in March that it cut the number of 737 MAX jets it expects to fly next summer from 58 down 
to 30 due to the delivery delays.According to the report, the reduction is expected to hamper the airline's growth 
and reduce the number of passengers it can carry at least until 2021.According to its annual report, the Ryanair 
group currently has over 16,000 employees.DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features. Sign up

Images The CEO of one of the world's largest airlines said Boeing needs to get its "shit together" as the grounding 
of the 737 Max drags on longer than expected. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said that potentially none of the 58 
new Max planes it had expected to arrive by summer 2020 could be delivered on time. "It could well move to zero if 
Boeing don't get their shit together pretty quickly with the regulator," he said, referencing Ryanair saying it now only 
expects 30 of the 58 737 Max planes it ordered to arrive by 2020. Ryanair's profits fell by 21% in the first quarter 
due to high fuel costs, low passenger fares, and impacts of the 737 Max. Ryanair said it still has confidence in the 
Max, but O'Leary warned of job cuts and potentially closure of some of its airport bases as the plane remains stuck 
on the ground. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. The CEO of one of the world's largest airlines said that 
Boeing needs to get its "shit together" as the ongoing grounding of its 737 Max planes extends beyond predictions 
and the carrier's profits take a hit. Ryanair, which exclusively flies Boeing planes, is among the airlines suffering the 
most after the 737 Max was grounded around the world. The grounding has led to cancelled flights and delayed 
deliveries for airlines around the world, many of whom are now demanding compensation. Ryanair, the biggest low-
cost carrier in Europe, had ordered 135 of the 737 Max planes, with the first 58 of those planes due to arrive by 
summer 2020. The airline was the fifth-biggest in the world[2]by seating capacity in 2018, and is the world's largest 
airline by number of routes[3]. Read more: Boeing says it could suspend 737 Max production if grounding 
continues, putting tens of thousands of jobs at risk[4] Michael O'Leary, the CEO of the Irish airline, warned on an 
earnings call on Monday that it is possible none of those planes will arrive by then."It may well move to 20, it could 
move to 10, and it could well move to zero if Boeing don't get their shit together pretty quickly with the regulator," he 
said, CNBC reported[5].  Ryanair said on Monday[6] that it had revised its expectations from the full 58 737 Max 
planes to only 30 planes arriving by the summer. He also warned of potential job cuts as the plane remains 
grounded. Read more: Ryanair appears to be rebranding its Boeing 737 Max jets as customers say they don't want

for the first quarter of this year, attributing the drop partly to the 737 Max delays. It also blamed higher fuel costs, 
lower fares for passengers, and fewer people from the UK flying because of Brexit-related fears.Regulators have 
not announced a return date for the plane, and delays have been continually extended beyond what anyone in the 
industry had expected. Ryanair said on Monday[8] that the plane would return "probably January at the earliest,"

safest plane ever to fly when the updates are certified and the plane returns to the sky. Ryanair had said earlier this 
month[10] that the grounding of the 737 Max means that it will carry fewer passengers and may close some of its 
airport bases — where planes and staff are permanently kept — as a result.Ryanair is among a number of airlines 
that have seen its profits hit by the 737 Max grounding. Many, including the Irish carrier, are now looking for 
compensation from Boeing. Read more: Pilots joined a growing number of airlines in demanding payback from

November as it cannot fly its 737 Max jets. Southwest Airlines also said it was removing the plane from its schedule 
until January 2020 and said it took a $175 million hit[13] to its operating income in Q2 due to the Max. Read more

German airline Lufthansa has reported sliding profits in the second quarter. Stiff competition from budget European 
carriers and rising operating costs are eating into the company's earnings.Lufthansa said Tuesday its net profit fell 
to €226 million ($252 million) in April-June — a year-on-year drop of 70%, which was partly due to a €200-million 
tax provision.The outlook was expected to remain gloomy at least until the end of the year, the Frankfurt-based 
airline said in a statement.Fuel price increases, "persistent overcapacities" and "aggressive competition" from 
budget airlines in Europe, such as Ryanair and Easyjet, were taking their toll, the airline added. 
Economic prospects have also been tainted by global issues such as the US-China trade wars and Brexit.Read

carriers in alliances like Austrian and Swiss Air, said there had been a 7% increase in costs, including a fuel bill that 
had risen by €225 million since the 2018 second quarter.Despite a shrinking bottom line, the company saw sales 
increase by 4% to €9.6 billion compared to the same time last year.Lufthansa said long-haul flights, particularly to 
Asia and North America, continued to turn a profit, while no frills Eurowings was struggling in the tough European 
market.Read more: Lufthansa profits soar after Air Berlin demiseChief Financial Officer Ulrik Svensson said the

added.Frankfurt's benchmark DAX 30 index tumbled 1.5% in early afternoon on Tuesday, while Lufthansa slid 6% 
after making its announcement.Last month, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr slashed its adjusted earnings forecast 
for this year to €2 billion to €2.4 billion, down from the previous estimate of €2.4 billion to €3 billion.Read more:

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/holidaymakers-face-chaos-as-british-airways-pilots-vote-in-favour-of-strike-
action/British Airways pilots have voted strongly in favour of industrial action in a dispute with the airline over 
pay.Ninety-three per cent of those balloted voted in favour of strike action, on a turnout of 90 per cent. Brian 
Strutton, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots' Association, said: 'This strong result demonstrates the 
resolve of BA pilots, and shows BA that it must table a sensible improved offer if a strike is to be averted. 
'Sadly three days of ACAS talks have not moved the company's position one iota. Settlement of this dispute is in 
BA's hands. 'We do not wish to inconvenience customers which is why we have tried to resolve this matter through 
negotiation starting last November - it is BA who has regrettably chosen to drag this out into the summer months.' 
Balpa represents around 85 per cent of British Airways pilots.High Court challengeThe union has not yet said when 
it plans to hold the strike action. This is because BA has tabled an immediate legal challenge. The airline is seeking 
a High Court injunction over legal technicalities surrounding the ballot. The hearing will take place tomorrow 
morning. British Airways said it has offered an 11.5 per cent pay rise over three years. A spokesperson said: 'We 
are very disappointed that Balpa, the pilots' union, has chosen to threaten the travel plans of thousands of our 
customers, over the summer holidays, with possible strike action. 'We remain open to working with Balpa to reach 
an agreement, which we have been doing since December. 'We continue to pursue every avenue to find a solution 
to protect our customers' travel plans and avoid industrial action and we urge Balpa to return to talks as soon as 
possible.'A 'summer of disruptions'Balpa's vote means BA pilots will join Heathrow and Gatwick airport staff in 
striking this summer. Furthermore, Easyjet check-in staff have planned strikes, which will kick off on Thursday. 
Ryanair pilots will also vote in the coming weeks on whether to take industrial action in August. Money.co.uk 
personal finance expert Salman Haqqi said: 'Millions of Brits are facing a summer of disruptions, as a perfect storm 
of airport and airline strikes could leave their holiday plans in tatters. 'If airline staff strike and your flight to or from 
the UK is cancelled, thanks to EU regulations, you are entitled to: a full refund; or an alternative flight to your 
destination from a nearby airport, with the airline responsible for additional travel costs; or an alternative flight on a 
later date outside the strike period. 'However, this will be scant consolation for many holidaymakers, as the 
likelihood of being able to book onto an alternative flight during this peak period will be slim to non existent.' Read

Jul 19, 2019( CleanTechnica: http://cleantechnica.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Air Quality[1]   Published on July 
19th, 2019 | by Steve Hanley    July 19th, 2019 by Steve Hanley[2]           https://future-
trends.cleantechnica.com/subscribe/ Let's face it. Flying is a dreadful idea if the objective is to lower total global 
carbon emissions. While the amount of CO2 emitted per passenger per mile may be modest, with more than 37 
million commercial flights each year[3], a lot of carbon gets injected high in the atmosphere, where it stays for an 
extended period of time. Total emissions from air travel are close to 900 million tons a year[4], about 12% of all 
transportation emissions worldwide.
https://cleantechnica.com/files/2019/07/Ryanair-airplane.jpgPhoto by RyanairReactionaries like to snicker up their 
sleeves about provisions of the Green New Deal[5] that call for reductions in carbon emissions from air travel. 
'They're coming for your airplanes!' they scream, as if doing nothing is an intelligent way to deal with the burgeoning 
climate crisis. A fight has broken out in Europe in the past few days about those emissions. It started when Carsten 
Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, told a Swiss newspaper that discount airlines like Ryanair, which offer fares as low as 
€10, create a demand for air travel that raises pollution and makes the industry an easy target for climate 
advocates. Such fares are 'economically, ecologically and politically irresponsible,' Spohr said. Kenny Jacobs, head 
of marketing for Ryanair, was quick to offer a retort. He gleefully pointed out that Lufthansa is one of the biggest 
polluters in the European market. It emits about 92 grams per passenger per kilometer. Ryanair has a far more 
enviable record at 66.8 grams per passenger per kilometer. Another European low fare carrier, Wizz Air, leads the 
competition with a figure below 60 g/km. Ryanair immediately e-mailed 15 million potential customers in Germany 
and central Europe — Lufthansa's largest market — touting his company's low fares and low emissions. 'I give our 
thanks to Lufthansa for making our marketing costs less,' Jacobs says. 'We're very happy with the comparison.' The 
airline industry is taking more heat recently as the transportation and utility sectors are beginning to reduce their 
carbon emissions. A round trip flight from London to New York is responsible for the same amount of emissions as 
heating a typical home home for a year. Bloomberg[6] says aviation will become the most polluting industry within 
three decades as other industries continue to lower the amount of carbon dioxide their activities create. The 
European Aviation Safety Agency announced in June it will grade jets by emissions to help people choose between 
airlines. France has recently unveiled a flight tax it says is partly a response to the sector's role in global warming. 
The low cost carriers typically operate narrower 2 engine airplanes that are more efficient than larger four engine 
aircraft Lufthansa and other long distance airlines rely on. In total, Lufthansa emitted 32.3 million tons of carbon 
dioxide in 2018. The total for Ryanair was a mere 10 million tons. The fight is relevant at a time when the airline 
industry is experiencing rising demand each year. A carbon fee would help lower demand, but would mean a 
European Airlines Brawl Over Carbon Emissions
constraint on the traditional airline business model, something reactionaries rail against. It would also make biofuels 
more competitive with conventional jet fuel and help encourage development of non-polluting electric aircraft. The 
squabble is a precursor of many more struggles that will happen as the business community tries to address the 
challenges of a warming planet due to the overuse of fossil fuels. Those struggles may require people to choose 
between convenience and a sustainable environment.            https://cleantechnica.com/cleantechnica-newsletters/

Jul 16, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  REUTERS/Francois 
Lenoir One of the world's largest airlines said it will carry fewer passengers and could even close airport bases as it 
waits for the Boeing 737 Max to return. Ryanair, Europe's top airline by passenger numbers in 2019, cut its 
passenger growth forecast by 4% and said it will discuss with airports and unions what underperforming or loss-
making bases could be cut, or even completely closed. It said that this was due to ongoing delays with the return of 
the Boeing 737 Max, which have not been delivered as they remain grounded while regulators find more problems 
with the planes. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said that the airline still has confidence in the 737 Max, but it would 
be "prudent" to think that it might not return until as late as December. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. One of the world's largest airlines says it expects to carry 
fewer passengers and could cut operations at some of its airport bases as a result of the grounding of the Boeing 
737 Max. Ryanair said on Monday that it now expects to carry 3% more passengers in summer 2020 than in 
summer 2019 — but that it had previously expected to carry 7% more passengers. According to Reuters[2], it said 
that it expects to carry 157 million passengers in the year up to March 2021, while it had previously expected to 
carry 162 million. The Irish airline — currently the fifth biggest in the world[3] by passenger numbers — also said 
that it could cut operations at some of its airport bases for winter 2019 and summer 2020, and may even close 
some altogether. It did not specify how many bases may be affected, or which ones. "We are starting a series of 
discussions with our airports to determine which of Ryanair's underperforming or loss making bases should suffer 
these short term cuts and/or closures from November 2019," CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement.Ryanair said 
it would start talking to airports to see which of its bases were underperforming or making a loss, and consider if 
their operations could be cut or even stopped from November, It currently has 83 bases across Europe and North 
Africa, including in Belfast, Bratislava, Milan, Frankfurt, and Berlin. Bases are airports where Ryanair permanently 
keeps both staff and aircraft. Read more: Ryanair appears to be rebranding its Boeing 737 Max jets as customers

return of the Boeing 737 Max plane, which has been grounded around the world since March after a second fatal 
crash involving the plane. The two crashes killed 346 people. While Ryanair was not flying any of the 737 Max 
planes that it had ordered before the crashes occurred, the grounding has delayed the deliveries of these planes to

Ryanair. It has ordered[5] 135 737 Max planes, with options to add another 75 to its fleet.There is no set time yet for 
when the 737 Max will be certified to fly again by regulators after Boeing updates the plane. New issues mean that 
the plane has remained grounded past the July date by which Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary previously thought the 
plane would return. O'Leary said in a statement on Monday that while Boeing estimates the plane to return close to 
September, the airline thought it would be "prudent to plan for that date to slip by some months, possibly as late as 
December." Ryanair also faces another issue as it ordered a variant of the 737 Max 8 called the 737 Max 200, 
which O'Leary said would need to be certified separately by US and European regulators.  He estimated that this 
would happen within two months of than the other Max planes.Ryanair's fleet is currently made up solely of Boeing 
737-800 planes, and O'Leary asserted that the airline is still confident in adding the 737 Max model. "Ryanair 
remains committed to the 737 Max aircraft, and now expects that it will return to flying service before the end of 
2019, however the exact date of this return remains uncertain." But, like many other airlines, Ryanair is looking for 
compensation[6] from Boeing over the aircraft delays. Read more:Pilots have joined a growing number of airlines in

customer fears as many say they do not want to fly on the aircraft, even when Boeing's updates are approved.

Top stories from the Proactive Investors UK newsroom.Clinigen (LON:CLIN) will post annual revenues at least 19% 
higher this year with underlying profits up by more than 30%. Acquisitions plus good underlying growth overall have 
driven the improvement. European Metals (LON:EMH) is to receive a €2mln convertible loan from Czech state-
owned power group CEZ to help develop its lithium project. CEZ will become one of the group's largest 
shareholders if it converts the loan.BigDish (LON:DISH) has partnered with restaurant award group Oceanic Media, 
which will promote the app via various marketing channels to over 3,500 UK restaurants that receive nominations. 
Ryanair has warned that the grounding of Boeing's 737 Max aircraft has forced it to revise its schedule meaning 
next summer's growth will now be 3% rather 7%. Some airports will be cut due to the lower than expected 
passenger numbers.Rio Tinto might have to pay almost US$2bn more than expected due to delays to the 
underground copper mine development at Oyo Tolgoi in Mongolia. Unexpected geotechnical issues have caused 
the delay to the project, which is now scheduled to start producing up to 30 months later than expected in June 
2023.

Jul 15, 2019( Memeburn: http://memeburn.com Delivered by Newstex)  A picture posted to Twitter on Sunday of a 
new Boeing 737 MAX suggests that the American plane manufacturer may be open to renaming its troubled plane 
after all. Captured by planespotter Woodys Aeroimages at Boeing's Seattle plant, the latest 737 MAX 200 plane 
produced for Irish airline Ryanair no longer has '737 MAX' on the side of its cockpit, but rather 737-8200. The plane 
is still referrred to as the 737 MAX 200, denoting the larger version of the '8' aircraft. But it seems that either 
Ryanair or Boeing itself has made a decision to drop the 'MAX' label from the aircraft.HI-Res Photos: The MAX 
name has been dropped from the high capacity version of the #737MAX8[1] that @Ryanair[2] has on order. 
pic.twitter.com/3q5QBN0TTg[3]; — Woodys Aeroimages (@AeroimagesChris) July 15, 2019[4] Looks like 
@Ryanair[5] is dropping the MAX title from is new #737MAX200[6] aircraft. Instead of '737 MAX' on the nose the 
5th aircraft rolled out of paint wearing '737-8200' in its place. pic.twitter.com/37HH5axgQx[7]; — Woodys 
Aeroimages (@AeroimagesChris) July 14, 2019[8]Interestingly, removing the MAX label and simply using 737-8 
also fits in with current Boeing trends of suffixing the single series number, like Boeing's 747-8, or 787-9. It's not 
clear if there are more aircraft or airlines set to simplify the plane series' name, nor if this was a decision made by 
Boeing, Ryanair, or both. Either way, it's less likely a painter's error, and more likely influenced by this particular 
plane series' troubled history. Two 737 MAX 8 crashes within six months, in Indonesia last year and Ethiopia earlier 
this year, killed a total of 346 people. Although the reason for the accidents have not yet been determined, Boeing 
believes that it's MCAS safety system[9] played a role in both. As a result, all versions of Boeing's 737 MAX planes 
have been grounded since March[10]. South Africa's lone 737 MAX 8 aircraft[11], owned by Comair, has also been 
grounded for more than four months[12]. Notably, the plane version involved in both was the smaller variant, the 
737 MAX 8, not the slightly different 737 MAX 200 that Ryanair has on order. The largest low cost carrier in Europe 
has more than 100[13] of the 737 MAX 200 yet to be delivered. It's not yet clear when the Boeing 737 MAX fleet will 
be allowed to fly again, or if they'll be using that name when that time comes. Ryanair's currently the largest global 
operator of the older Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Feature image: The Boeing 737 MAX 8, by Boeing The post New

Jul 15, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair One of the 
world's largest airlines seems to be rebranding its Boeing 737 Max jets. An aviation blogger and photographer shot 
a Ryanair plane with the 737 Max text on the plane replaced with 737 8200, a name that might come from the 737 
Max 200 model that Ryanair had ordered. Ryanair has expressed confidence in Boeing, but is looking for 
compensation as the plane remains grounded around the world, as many other airlines are doing. Customers seem 
less confident in flying on the planes, and airlines are finding different ways to accommodate them and soothe 
these fears.

its Boeing 737 Max jets as customers say they don't want to fly on the plane after its two fatal crashes. Woodys

Michael O'Leary, the CEO of the Irish airline, has continued to express confidence in Boeing[8], though like many 
other airlines he said is seeking compensation[9] as the jets remain grounded around the world after the two 
crashes and further plane deliveries are stalled.Ryanair flies a fleet made up exclusively of Boeing planes, though it 
had not yet started flying the Max planes it had ordered before the plane model was grounded around the world.

has even said that it is open to the idea of renaming the Max[11], though experts told Business Insider that such a 
move would be seen as a transparent stunt. Airlines have mostly continued to express confidence in Boeing 
publicly, though the company's status as the world's largest planemaker is under threat as deliveries stall[12] and at 
least one airline has cancelled its order for Max planes[13]. Customers have expressed skepticism about the plane 
after two crashes, in Indonesia in October 2018 and in Ethiopia in March 2019, killed 346 people.In a June poll, 
41% of Americans said the plane would need to be safely back in service for six months before they would consider 
flying on it. And other airlines have also found ways to try and soothe customers' fears. American Airlines, for 
instance, said that it will fly senior executives on 737 Max planes[14] before any regular passengers in an attempt to 
reassure the public that the plane is safe. The planes will remain grounded until they are certified to fly again by the 
US Federal Aviation Administration and regulators around the world. Newly emerging issues[15] with the plane 
could see it grounded for months to come, and some airlines have cancelled flights until November as a 
result[16].Read more about the 737 Max crisis: Boeing is crowding its employee parking lot with undelivered 737

Jul 02, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, United 
Continental Holdings changed its name to United Airlines Holdings UAL[1] with immediate effect. Additionally, 
United Airlines disclosed its intention to launch a second daily nonstop flight between San Francisco and Hong 
Kong from Oct 26, 2019. Expansion-related updates were also available from the likes of JetBlue Airways JBLU[2] 
and Alaska Air Group's ALK[3] subsidiary — Alaska Airlines.Southwest Airlines LUV[4] too dominated headlines in 
the past week, courtesy of its updates on Boeing 737 MAX jets. This Dallas-based carrier initially said that the 
disputed jets in its fleet would remain grounded until Oct 1. However, on Jul 1, the low-cost carrier's CEO 
reportedly[5] stated that the 737 MAX jets in its fleet are not anticipated not operate even beyond that date owing to 
a new glitch detected by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Additionally, European low-cost carrier, Ryanair 
Holdings RYAAY[6], amended its buyback program in the past week.(Read the lastAirline Stock 
Rounduphere[7])Recap of Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. United Airlines' decision to launch additional 
flights to Hong Kong highlights its efforts to expand in Asia as the market offers significant commercial 
potential.Notably, the carrier will operate twice daily on this route using a Boeing 777-200ER aircraft. 
With the commencement of the new services, United Airlines will cover a total of 29 international destinations from 
San Francisco, serving eight cities across Europe, India and the Middle East, seven in North America, and 14 in 
Asia and Oceania. We remind investors that another airline heavyweight — Delta Airlines DAL[8] — too recently 
announced its intention to expand in Asia by virtue its decision to invest in Hanjin Kal Corp.[9]— the largest 
shareholder of Korean Air Lines.United Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[10].2. Southwest Airlines has the largest exposure to Boeing 737 
MAX jets among U.S. carriers. With 34 such jets in its fleet, the company had to cancel 115 flights on daily basis 
due to the groundings. The number may go up further as the jets are not expected to resume service in the next 
couple of months. The decision followed the FAA's finding of another potential safety issue with the jets. The 
problem reportedly [11]involves a microprocessor. The failure of the microprocessor during a flight can push the 
airplane's nose down. This comes as a major disappointment, with Boeing working on software upgrades for 
months following the crash of 737 Max 8 jets in Ethiopia and Indonesia, which resulted in the grounding of this 
model this March.3. JetBlue has plans to expand further across the Caribbean with a nonstop winter service 
between New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Guadeloupe's Pointe--Pitre International Airport. 
Besides the Caribbean expansion, the new service will help JetBlue boost its New York focus city strategy. The 
thrice-weekly flight will begin operation in February 2020. In the meantime, passengers can start booking seats from 
the next few weeks onward. (Read more: JetBlue to Start New York-Guadeloupe Service in 2020[12])4. In line with

its objective to limit the number of British shareholders, Ryanair amended the terms of a €700-million stock 
repurchase program. The €700-million buyback program commenced on May 21, 2019, and is expected to run for 
the next 9-12 months. Per the amended agreement, the airline will allow shares to be repurchased via block trades 
from 
EU 
shareholders.

Shareholding[13])Meanwhile, June traffic (including 0.6 million from its LaudaMotion unit) rose 13% year over year 
to 14.2 million, courtesy of upbeat demand for air travel. However, Ryanair's passenger growth, excluding traffic 
from LaudaMotion unit, was only 8% in June. Consolidated load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in the 
month was 97%. The carrier operated nearly 78,000 flights (scheduled) in June.5. In a bid to attract traffic during 
winter, Alaska Airlines has decided to operate additional flights to popular tourist destinations. As part of the 
carrier's efforts to increase service to Florida, Alaska Airlines has decided to operate a second daily flight between 
Seattle and Tampa from Dec 19 and a second daily flight connecting Seattle and Fort Lauderdale from Nov 5. The 
carrier will also operate a second peak day flight connecting Portland and Orlando from Jan 7, 2020, apart from a 
third flight connecting Seattle and Orlando flight starting on peak days from Jan 7. Once the new flights are 
operational, the carrier will operate eight daily flights to Florida. Alaska Airlines will offer services on the new routes 
through its Boeing 737-900ER jets.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline

Jun 27, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc. 
RYAAY[1] announced that it has amended the terms of a €700-million stock repurchase program to limit the 
number of British shareholders in the company. Through this move, the company aims to remain EU-owned majorly 
so as to comply with the licensing and flight rights. The €700-million buyback program commenced on May 21, 
2019 and is expected to run for the next 9-12 months.Earlier in March, Ryanair came to a resolution by virtue of 
which all shares held by non-EU shareholders (including British shareholders after Brexit) will be considered as 
"restricted shares", i.e, they will not be entitled to attend, speak or vote at company meetings.Per the amended 
agreement, the airline will allow shares to be repurchased via block trades from EU shareholders. In the event of a 
no-deal Brexit, block repurchases from UK shareholders will lower the number of shares held by non-EU 
shareholders. Consequently, the amendment should reduce the time period for which the above-mentioned 
resolutions 
need 
to 
be

Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Aims to Expand Through Malta Air Buyout
Ryanair (RYAAY) Aims to Expand Through Malta Air Buyout

Jun 13, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In a bid to expand its 
presence in Malta, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] has inked a deal to purchase Malta Air — a start-up carrier. 
However, the value of the deal was not disclosed.The acquisition, expected to be completed by June 30, 2019, will 
strengthen this European low-cost carrier's foothold in Malta. Also, it will allow the company to operate flights from 
Malta to non-EU markets (North Africa). Currently, Ryanair is responsible for transporting 3 million passengers to 
and from Malta.Following the buyout, the carrier aims to switch its Malta-based fleet of six B737 jets to the country's 
register. 
Additionally, Ryanair intends to increase the above fleet size to ten within three years. This, in turn, is anticipated to 
create in excess of 350 jobs. For summer 2020, Ryanair, which will get a Maltese air operator's certificate (AOC), 
plans to market its Malta-based fleet in Malta Air colors.Furthermore, this Irish company aims to move its planes 
from France, Italy and Germany onto the Maltese AOC for allowing the concerned crew members to pay income 
taxes locally. Under the current arrangement, they are required to pay under the carrier's Irish AOC.The acquisition 
apart, Ryanair, carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), was in the news recently owing to its May traffic report. In 
the month, traffic (including 0.6 million from its LaudaMotion unit) rose 13% year over year to 14.1 million, courtesy 
of upbeat demand for air travel. However, Ryanair's passenger growth, excluding traffic from LaudaMotion unit, was 
only 8% in May. Consolidated load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in the month was 96%.Stocks to 
ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation[2] sector may consider Fly Leasing FLY[3], GATX 
Corporation GATX[4] and SkyWest SKYW[5]. While Fly Leasing sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), GATX and 
SkyWest carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[6].Fly 
Leasing and GATX flaunt an encouraging earnings history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 
each of the trailing four quarters. Meanwhile, shares of SkyWest have surged more than 33% so far this

Jun 12, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Reuters Boeing's 737 
Max jet could stay grounded significantly longer than expected after two fatal crashes. A US Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) official said Wednesday that the plane will be back in the air by December. Other airline 
industry figures had suggested the plane could return to the skies this summer. A longer delay would be another 
blow to Boeing, which is having its worst year in decades. 
The FAA needs to approve a software update before the 737 Max can fly again. In the meantime, airlines are 
demanding compensation and investigations loom over Boeing and the FAA. Visit Business Insider's homepage for 
more stories[1] The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) indicated Wednesday that Boeing's 737 Max planes, 
which have been grounded around the world since March, could be out of action for even longer than expected. Ali 
Bahrami, the FAA's associate administrator for aviation safety, said at a speech in Europe that the plane will likely 
be airborne again by December. He was speaking at at a safety conference held by the FAA and Europe's EASA 
regulator. He said that the FAA is under a lot "lot of pressure" and that the plane will return to the skies "when we 
believe it is safe," Bloomberg reported[2]. Read more: As Boeing's problems mount, there's still no clear answer 
about when the 737 Max will return to the skies[3] The question of when the Max may return has proved a vexed 
one since its grounding after two fatal crashes.After the planes were taken out of the skies, Boeing began work on a 
software update which it says will make them safe again. The update has been submitted to the FAA, which must 
approve it before the plane can re-enter service. Other global regulators would then decide whether to follow suit. 
The FAA has said that it does not have a timeline for when the plane will return. But Bahrami's comment suggests 
that the plane could be out of service for longer than the industry thought. Airlines and industry groups have said 
they think the plane would return over or at the end of the summer. The new suggested date of December is a 
significant step back from that. Read more: Here are all the investigations and lawsuits that Boeing and the FAA are 
facing after the 737 Max crashes killed almost 350 people[4] The International Air Transport Association (IATA) 
director general said in May that he thought the plane would not be back in the sky until August. Ryanair CEO 
Michael O'Leary told CNBC in May[5] that he expected the plane to be in the air in the US in June or July.American 
Airlines has repeatedly cancelled flights which relied on the plane, most recently until September[6]. Bloomberg[7] 
reported in May that Boeing told Indian carrier SpiceJet, one of the biggest 737 Max buyers, that the aircraft would 
likely be flying again[8] by July. Boeing has declined to comment to Business Insider about when the 737 Max might 
return[9]. The planes were grounded in March, after a 737 Max operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed and killed all 
157 people on board. It was the second 737 Max plane to crash, after a plane operated by Lion Air smashed into 
The FAA says Boeing 's troubled 737 Max may not fly again until December — far later than many expected
the sea off Indonesia in October 2018, killing its 189 occupants. Airlines are seeking compensation[10] from Boeing 
for having to ground the planes and cancel flights. Read more: Boeing's 737 Max 8 nightmare and troublesome 
politics threaten the US's standing as the global aviation leader[11] The FAA is under pressure to help the jets 
return to service while also working to preserve its reputation for safety, which has come under fire[12] as people 
question how the 737 Max was certified to fly. EASA and other regulators also say that they want to do their own 
checks, and have their own requirements for when the plane returns. This could mean it starts to fly in some parts 
of the world before others. Both the FAA and Boeing face a number of investigations[13] into how the plane was 
able to take to the skies, including federal investigations that could change how the FAA certifies aircraft.NOW

How to turn around loss making rural rail lines
How to turn around loss making rural rail lines
Adam Smith Institute Blog

Jun 11, 2019( Adam Smith Institute Blog: http://www.adamsmith.org/blog Delivered by Newstex) ; From the north of 
Scotland to the tip of Cornwall loss-making rural railway lines are embedded in the landscape. Epitomised by slow, 
infrequent clapped out trains often carrying just a handful of passengers they wind their way from somewhere to 
nowhere. Inefficient, unappealing and ultimately underused it's understandable why many question why such lines 
continue to be a 'drain on the public purse'.However, the reason for these lines survival is complex. 
Most of these routes are purely 'social'; to even suggest closure would be political suicide. So successive 
governments have simply given up and have resorted to instructing franchise operators to provide the bare 
minimum level of service.However, such a negative approach is short sighted. Private companies might run the 
services but with the regulatory brief so restrictive and narrow focused there is no ability for the companies to show 
entrepreneurial flair. If the state can't or won't make a go of it then it needs to allow the private sector - or at least a 
partnership between the two - to have a go. Conventional wisdom dictates that rural lines are loss making basket 
cases. But such narrow focused ideology is to miss a trick. After three months of painstaking forensic analysis of 
the Settle to Carlisle route, what was widely assumed to be a loss making liability in fact turns out to make a small 
profit. The route was once described by the late Bishop of Wakefield, the Rt Rev. Eric Treacy as 'the 8th wonder of 
the world'. While this exuberant ecclesiastical accolade might be over egging the pudding, there is no denying that 
the line has oodles of untapped potential. Had private sector nous been allowed to flourish earlier the route could by 
now be a major visitor attraction.Tourism is set to be worth 257bn to the UK economy by 2025. The Yorkshire and 
Cumbria Dales are major players yet are hampered by poor roads. The Settle to Carlisle route runs right through 
the middle of the Dales national park, it even has nine intermediate stations where today only a handful of people 
join or alight. If ever there was an example of supply so mismatched to potential demand through lack of vision this 
must surely be it. The line is currently run by the Northern Rail franchise, a vast short distance inter-urban provider 
of largely commuter trains serving conurbations such as Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield. 'No frills' trains of 
distinctly utilitarian ambience shuttle back and forth between city and suburb all day with the average fare less than 
a Starbucks latte. The Settle-Carlisle line is about as mismatched from Northern's core business as Ryanair would 
be from providing a bespoke limo service to 'Fortnum and Mason' shoppers. Over a drink recently, a friend who is 
the Finance Director for one of the leading industry players told me: 'The model for rural lines is all about delivering 
the status quo as cheaply as possible. There's barely a budget for marketing let along doing anything 
entrepreneurial.'As I identified in my recent ASI policy paper, How to Make Long-Distance Work: Fixing Britain's 
railways with open access[1], rail is not a 'one size fits all' model. Different routes have strengths, weaknesses and 
potential, whether its long distance business travellers, commuters, rural locals or tourists. What is needed is a 
How to turn around loss making rural rail lines
visionary new approach that looks at the assets individually and then adopts a bespoke plan. This approach would 
stimulate growth, generate additional revenue, support the wider economy and provide a better return on 
investment for the taxpayer.  With a focused service offering, improved rolling stock and targeted marketing there is 
huge potential for the Settle to Carlisle line to become a thriving niche business. The route can act as a foundation 
where other businesses can thrive off the back. The private sector is extraordinary adept as making a go of things 
with other Cinderella businesses having been turned around into successful ventures. For too long the railway 
industry languishes near the bottom of both innovation and creating thinking. Other businesses such as aviation, 
hospitality and retail have thrived largely as a result of a free market but also because there is a genuine desire to 
think outside the box and do things differently. It is widely accepted across the political spectrum that the current 
franchising model is broken. We need a consumer rather than government led railway where innovation is allowed 
to flourish. Only by adopting a broad and flexible approach will patronage increase, jobs be created, local 
economies strengthened and hard pressed taxpayers, at last, seeing more bang for their hard earned buck.Adrian 
Quine is a Non-Executive Director of the Settle to Carlisle Development Company Ltd and the author of a 
submission to the Williams Rail Review on turning around loss making rural lines. Twitter: @adrianquine[2] [ 1]:

Jun 07, 2019( The Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Police are investigating 
after a woman and her girlfriend were assaulted and robbed by a group of men on a London night bus.Ryanair flight 
attendant Melania Geymonat, 28, from Uruguay, was on a date with a woman called Chris when the incident began 
to unfold aboard the N1 night bus in West Hampstead, after a night out on Thursday, May 30.Writing in a Facebook 
post[1], accompanied by a picture of couple looking bloodied and distressed, Geymonat described how the group of 
four men targeted them after spotting them kiss.She wrote: 'They started behaving like hooligans, demanding that 
we kissed so they could enjoy watching, calling us 'lesbians' and describing sexual positions.'I don't remember the 
whole episode, but the word 'scissors' stuck in my mind. It was only them and us there. In an attempt to calm things 
down, I started making jokes. 
I thought this might make them go away.'Chris even pretended she was sick, but they kept on harassing us, 
throwing coins and becoming more enthusiastic about it. The next thing I know is Chris is in the middle of the bus 
fighting with them.'On an impulse, I went over there only to find her face bleeding and three of them beating her up. 
The next thing I know is I'm being punched. I got dizzy at the sight of my blood and fell back. I don't remember 
whether or not I lost consciousness. Suddenly the bus had stopped, the police were there and I was bleeding all 
over. Our stuff was stolen as well.'Geymonat is still waiting to learn if her nose was broken in the attack and 
remains off work.She added: 'What upsets me the most is that VIOLENCE HAS BECOME A COMMON THING, 
that sometimes it's necessary to see a woman bleeding after having been punched to feel some kind of impact. I'm 
tired of being taken as a SEXUAL OBJECT, of finding out that these situations are usual, of gay friends who were 
beaten up JUST BECAUSE. We have to endure verbal harassment AND CHAUVINIST, MISOGYNISTIC AND 
HOMOPHOBIC VIOLENCE because when you stand up for yourself shit like this happens.'By the way, I am 
thankful to all the women and men in my life that understand that HAVING BALLS MEANS SOMETHING 
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. I just hope that in June, Pride[2] Month, stuff like this can be spoken out loudly so they 
STOP HAPPENING!'Both women were taken to hospital for treatment for facial injuries and a phone and bag were 
stolen during the assault.The Met Police have confirmed they are investigating the attack and have appealed for 
witnesses to contact police.London Mayor Sadiq Khan[3]has also appealed for witnesses, branding the attack 
'disgusting and misogynistic.'According to Stonewall, one in five LGBT people have experienced a hate crime or 
incident because of their sexual orientation and/ or gender identity in the last 12 months, with four in five of those 
going unreported. This article originally appeared on The Huffington Post https://www.huffpost.com/entry/woman-

Jun 04, 2019( ACTmedia News: http://actmedia.eu Delivered by Newstex)  Low-cost airline Wizz Air is expecting a 
growth in profit this year after delivering solid results for the 12 months to March 31 on Friday, Reuters reports. The 
air carrier is optimistic that it will do better than competitors in a context of a challenging operating environment and 
higher fuel costs in the coming year. Wizz Air is mainly focused on eastern and central Europe, meaning that it 
avoids the intense competition on some popular Mediterranean routes, which have caused a dip in earnings for 
similar airlines like easyJet and Ryanair. The airline said air traffic control and airport infrastructure were some of 
the biggest challenges it anticipated in the coming year. The company's net profit is expected to reach the EUR 
320-350 million range, after a net profit of EUR 292 million for the year to March 31, in line with forecasts. Wizz 
shares fell 3.4 percent after the results, but remain up by 10 percent in 2019, outperforming Europe's biggest 
airlines which are all down for the year.

Holdings RYAAY[1] have lost 41.6% in a year's time compared with theindustry[2]'s 15.7% decline.One-Year Price 
PerformanceDuring fiscal 2019 (ended Mar 31, 2019), Ryanair's full-year profit (excluding LaudaMotion) declined 
29% to €1.02 billion due to a 6% decline in airfares. Unit costs, excluding fuel, rose 5% due to higher labor costs 
among other factors. Capital expenditures during the period were in excess of €1.5 billion. 
Net debt increased year over year to €450 million.Ryanair's labor agitation continues to cause flight cancellations 
that are hampering bookings. Moreover, the company is concerned about a Brexit-related impact.These headwinds 
have compelled the company to issue a bleak outlook for fiscal 2020. Fuel costs are anticipated to escalate by €460 
million and push up total expenses. Meanwhile, non-fuel unit costs are projected to ascend 2% due to delivery 
delays of the B737 MAX aircraft and other factors. Notably, the carrier has delayed the delivery of first 5 B737-MAX 
aircraft till the winter season. Group profits are estimated to be largely flat year over year.The fact that the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2020 earnings has been revised downward to the tune of 27.4% over the past 60

through the Dutch company Flight Claim.ro between 250 and 600 euro from the airline companies, a press release 
shows. 
The company registers daily between 30 and 50 demands for compensation from the Romanian passengers who 
want to get their rights from the airline companies. Most delayed and annulled flights were registered by the Tarom 
company, as well as the low cost companies Wizz Air, Ryanair and Blue Air. According the data FlightClaim.ro, the 
destinations with the highest delays are Milan, Madrid, Rome, Larnace and London. ' The charter flights in summer 
represent a special risk for the Romanian passengers and that is why our team cooperates with the tourism 
agencies in Romania to insure the support and necessary assistance for their tourists in this situation. We have 
obtained compensations for the Romanian passengers whose flight, starting in Romania was annulled for 
operational reasons' Cees Werff, general manager FlightClaim.ro stated. Depending on the delay, the passengers 
are liable for compensations between 250 and 600 euro/person, plus other expenses. Under 10% of the 
passengers affected by delayed or annulled flights or whose boarding was denied are interested to require 
compensation of 250, 400 or 600 euro from the airline companies or through specialized companies. This extremely 
low percentage is due to the lack of knowledge of the rights of passengers, difficulties in getting into direct contact 
with the airline company or lack of time. FlightClaim.EU.com is a specialized company for the assistance of 
passengers with delayed, annulled or overbooking flights to get legal compensations from the airline companies. 
The company has been present on the European market for two years and in Romania for one year. Flightclaim.ro 
has obtained until now compensations of over 20,000 passengers from Europe and for over 5,000 passengers of 
Romania, without any initial cost for the affected passengers.

growing list of airlines looking for compensation or amending orders as Boeing's crisis continues, even as some 
carriers continue to express support for the manufacturer. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[2] Air 
China and two more of China's largest airlines have become the latest carriers to look for compensation from 
Boeing as the 737 Max[3] plane remains grounded around the world following two fatal crashes. Air China, China 
Southern Airlines, and China Eastern Airlines have requested compensation from Boeing for the losses that have 
resulted from the grounding of their Max planes and the delayed deliveries of more of the plane model, Reuters 
reported[4], citing Chinese state TV. 
They join a growing list of airlines that have reacted to the crashes or the wait for Boeing the plane to return to 
service by cancelling or amending orders, or looking for compensation. Here is the full list: Air China, China 
Southern Airlines, and China Eastern Airlines: The airlines are asking for compensation for losses after the 
grounding of the planes and delayed deliveries of new Max planes. Ryanair: The budget airline's CEO said[5] he 
wants compensation for the delays, but said his company still has confidence in Boeing. Turkish Airlines: The 
airline's chairman said[6] he expects compensation from Boeing and would talk with the manufacturer about its 
orders. FlyDubai: FlyDubai's chairman said[7] in April that the airline has the "right" to ask for compensation and 
could replace its order for Max jets with an order from Airbus, Boeing's European rival, amid uncertainty over when 
the Max will fly again. Norwegian Air: Norwegian said in March[8] that it was seeking compensation from Boeing for 
its grounded fleets. Southwest: Gary Kelly, Southwest's chief executive, said the airline would talk to Boeing 
"privately" about arrangements, The Financial Times reported[9], though he told Bloomberg[10] that it was 
"premature" to talk about what compensation it was seeking. United Airlines: United's chief financial officer said in 
April that the airline would discuss compensation with Boeing over the grounding of the planes. Garuda: Indonesia's 
flagship airline asked to cancel[11] a $5 billion order for 737 Max planes because passengers "lost trust and no 
longer have the confidence" in the plane. Boeing's Max planes were grounded around the world after an Ethiopian 
Airlines plane crashed in March, killing all 157 people on board. The plane was the second Max to crash in less 
than five months, following a Lion Air plane that crashed in Indonesia killing the 189 people on board in October 
2018.Boeing has completed a software update[12] for the Max, which will undergo scrutiny from the US Federal 
Air China is the latest airline to demand payback from Boeing for its 737 Max disasters — here's the full list
Aviation Administration and regulators around the world before the plane can return to the skies. Read more: After 
the first fatal 737 Max crash, Boeing said it hadn't installed an extra safety feature because it might 'confuse' 
pilots[13] But the groundings, delayed deliveries of new Max planes, and continuing uncertainty over when the 
plane will be able to return to service has led airlines to cancel months of flights and warn of hits to their profits[14]. 
European and US airlines have warned that they will lose hundreds of millions of dollars over the crisis. Southwest, 
which has the largest 737 Max fleet in the world, said it lost $200 million in the first three months of 2019 due to 
cancellations caused by the grounding of the plane and the government shutdown.The crisis cost Boeing itself $1 
billion[15] in the first quarter of 2019, and it also faces lawsuits from victims' families and from shareholders and 
federal investigations into how the plane got certified in addition to the airlines' demands. Boeing has promised that 
the plane will be one of the "safest ever to fly" when it returns to service and that the company will "earn and re-
earn" flyers' trust. It said that it is working closely regulators and with airlines and pilots to provide additional 
training. Do you work at Boeing or the FAA, or are you a pilot? Got a tip or a story to share? Contact this reporter
