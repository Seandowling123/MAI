RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC - INTERIM DIVIDEND FOR FY24
Dividend Information
Ryanair Holdings plc is pleased to announce that the FY24 interim dividend of (EURO)0.175 per ordinary share will 
be payable to shareholders on the register of members at close of business on 19 January, 2024. The dividend will 
be paid on 28 February, 2024.
Dividends Payments
Dividends will be paid in euro to all shareholders. Shareholders holding their shares via the central securities 
depository operated by Euroclear Bank or via CREST will receive dividends electronically via such systems.
However, in order to avoid inconvenience to overseas certificated shareholders when negotiating euro cheques, the 
Company has arranged that its registrar, Link Registrars Limited (the "Registrar"), will provide an International 
Payments Service ("IPS"), whereby dividends can be paid to those shareholders in their local currency. If 
shareholders wish to have their dividend paid in a currency other than Euro then they must complete an IPS 
mandate 
which 
can 
be 
obtained 
from 
the 
registrar 
and 
will 
be 
available 
on 
their 
website 
https://www.linkgroup.eu/get-in-touch/shareholders-in-irish-companies/. This election form must be completed and 
received by Link Registrars Limited, PO Box 7117, Dublin 2, Ireland (By Post) or to Link Registrars Limited, Suite 
149, The Capel Building, Mary's Abbey, Dublin 7, D07 DP79, Ireland (by hand during normal business hours) by 
close of business on 26 January, 2024.
RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC - INTERIM DIVIDEND FOR FY24
For certificated shareholders, dividends will be paid by cheque and will be sent by ordinary post on 27 February, 
2024. Alternatively, if you are in the Single Euro Payments Area ("SEPA") you can update your bank details on the 
Registrar's share portal www.signalshares.com. You will need your Investor Code ("IVC") to register on the portal 
and this can be found on your share certificate.
Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) currently deducted at a rate of 25%, must be deducted from dividends paid by an 
Irish resident company, unless a shareholder is entitled to an exemption and has submitted a properly completed 
exemption form to the Registrar. Non-resident shareholders and certain Irish companies, trusts, pension schemes, 
investment undertakings and charities may be entitled to claim exemption from DWT. Copies of the form may be 
obtained online from the Irish Revenue Commissioners. Shareholders should note that DWT will be deducted from 
dividends in cases where a properly completed form has not been received by the market deadline date for a 
dividend, which is Friday, 26 January 2024 in this case. Individuals who are resident in Ireland for tax purposes are 
not entitled to an exemption. If shares are held via Euroclear Bank or via CREST, the owners of the shares will 
need to contact the intermediary through whom the shares are held to ascertain their arrangements and cut-off 
times for tax relief for eligible investors to be applied at source.

(a closed-ended investment company incorporated in Guernsey with registration number 41996)

Attached is a link to the Monthly Investment Report for November 2023.
http://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/5590W_1-2023-12-12.pdf
November proved to be a positive month for asset owners, as both bonds and equities rallied sharply. The catalyst 
was a growing hope that falling inflation will not be accompanied by slowing economic growth. This is an ideal 
outcome since it would allow policymakers to gently ease interest rates, helping to sustain high equity valuations 
without dampening earnings. Policymakers have also changed their tone, leaving investors less concerned about 
further monetary policy tightening.
The market moves were significant, with global bonds experiencing their best monthly return since 2008 and US 
equities recording their best monthly return this year. We added to the Company's bond duration in recent months 
to take advantage of compelling valuations (eg US ten year real yields reaching 2.5%), and with the belief that 
yields were reaching levels beyond which they would begin to cause acute pain to the financial system. The 
increased exposure enabled the Company to further benefit from November's rally in fixed income, which was the 
largest contributor to returns over the month. Likewise in equities, we had tactically added to the Company's 
exposure as risk assets struggled with rising yields in prior months. These increases to both bonds and equities 
Monthly Investment Report - November 2023
enabled the portfolio to deliver a positive return and outweighed the headwinds from our protective assets. From a 
stock picking perspective, holdings in Ryanair, Coty and Jackson Financial were large positive contributors, 
alongside exposure to US banks Citi and EastWest.
On the negative side of the ledger, protective positions to guard against pain in the corporate bond market naturally 
suffered in the buoyant environment as credit spreads narrowed sharply. Elsewhere, exposure to energy was a 
headwind, partly as the perceived risk of wider military conflict across the Middle East has faded. Within our growth 
seeking assets, the exposure to Chinese equities continued to stutter. Whilst we deem the visit of Xi Jinping to San 
Francisco as a positive step in easing the tensions between the World's two largest powers, investor sentiment 
remains weak. We acknowledge there are good reasons for the high risk premium applied to Chinese equities, but 
it does stand out for both depressed valuations and, in our view, the increasing likelihood of further policy stimulus 
to come.
Given the speed of the rally across bonds and equities, we felt it was prudent to reduce the Company's exposures 
towards the end of the month. Bond markets are now pricing in over 1% of interest rate cuts in 2024 from the 
Federal Reserve. High equity valuations, tight credit spreads and low volatility suggest complacency may have 
returned to financial markets. There is a path for policymakers to pull off the magic trick of raising interest rates 
aggressively without derailing the economy, but we see an obvious vulnerability should events deviate from this 
narrow route. Policy changes feed through with a lag and the initial signs of a possible soft landing are eerily similar 
to those pre-empting something more severe. The Company's portfolio is designed to deliver positive returns in 
both benign conditions such as we saw this month, but also in those which are likely to be more challenging ahead.

Results for the year to 30 September 2023
Over the year to 30 September 2023, the Company's net asset value per share (NAV) total return was 8.3% 
compared to a total return of 20.5% for the comparative index. The share price total return for the same period was 
8.6%.
· Positive contributors in the period included: Ryanair, which continued to take market share from weaker airlines 
and invest in new capacity; and online classified companies Adevinta and its major shareholder Schibsted which 
showed that they can offset temporarily weaker volumes with price increases.
· Negative contributors in the period included: battery startup Northvolt which was written down to reflect moves in 
public benchmarks, though operational progress remains good; and payments processing company Adyen which 
fell after announcing some market share losses in the US.
· Annual turnover was 9% and gearing stood at 15.6% of shareholders' funds as at the year end.
· The portfolio now contains five unlisted companies accounting for 10.9% of total assets as at 30 September 2023 
(2022: 11.0% in four companies).

Chairman's Statement
Performance
The net asset value per share ('NAV') total return over the Company's financial year was 8.3% compared to a total 
return of 20.5% for the FTSE Europe ex UK Index, in sterling terms. The share price total return over the year was 
8.6%; as at 30 September 2023 the discount to NAV of the Company's shares was 13.6%.
The dramatic shift in macroeconomics and interest rates of all durations has continued to make it a challenging time 
for growth investors. Discount rates have risen; price earnings ratios are conversely lower. Despite strong 
operational performance from most of our holdings (further detail provided in the Managers' report on below) the 
share prices of the types of companies we own have not recovered from the significant falls we saw in the previous 
year, and in some cases have fallen further.
Since Baillie Gifford began managing the portfolio in November 2019, the NAV total return has been 9.3% 
compared to a total return of 25.1% for the FTSE Europe ex UK Index, in sterling terms. The share price total return 
has been 2.6%, with the discount widening from 7.5% to 13.6%.
After an initially strong run of performance, the Company has suffered two years of poor investment results. This 
has damaged the longer run outcome for now. The Board is painfully aware of the volatility and disappointment this 
has entailed for shareholders but is confident that Baillie Gifford's currently out-of-favour growth style will be 
vindicated in the longer term. The reason equity investment yields the best long run returns is that it involves 
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
volatility and requires patience and, on occasion, a degree of endurance. The Board therefore considers it 
premature to make a proper assessment of long-term performance.
Earnings and dividend
During the year the Company received a repayment of tax (and interest) from HMRC, totalling £7.9 million (2.20p 
per share) following receipt of a settlement agreement in relation to the Franked Investment Group ('FII GLO') 
computational-based claims. The Board distributed this to shareholders as a special interim dividend of 2.20p per 
ordinary share on 15 September 2023.
Revenue return per share for the year was 2.68p (2022 - 0.79p) and the Board is recommending a final dividend of 
0.40 p per ordinary share (2022 - 0.70p). Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting ('AGM'), 
the dividend will be paid on 2 February 2024 to shareholders on the register on 5 January 2024. The ex-dividend 
date will be 4 January 2024.
Borrowings
The Company has two (EURO)30 million long-term debt facilities: the first has a remaining duration of 17 years and 
is priced at a fixed rate of 1.57% and the other has over 12 years outstanding at a fixed rate of 1.55%. The 
Company also has an undrawn (EURO)30 million overdraft facility with The Northern Trust Company, which at 
present is capped at (EURO)15 million following Board agreement. At the year end, the Company had gearing of 
15.6% of shareholders' funds.
Share buybacks, issuance and discount
Over the course of the Company's financial year, the share price moved from a 13.5% discount to NAV to a 13.6% 
discount to NAV. During this period, the Company bought back 538,471 shares at a total cost of approximately 
£501,000. The shares repurchased by the Company are held in treasury and are available to be reissued, at a 
premium, when market conditions allow.
The Board is of the view that the Company should retain the power to buy back shares during the year and so, at 
the AGM, is seeking to renew the annual authority to repurchase up to 14.99% of the shares in the Company in 
issue. When buying back shares, the Board does not have a formal discount target and is prepared to buy back 
shares opportunistically.
The Company also has authority to issue new shares and to reissue any shares held in treasury for cash on a non 
pre-emptive basis. Shares are issued/reissued only at a premium to NAV, thereby enhancing NAV for existing 
shareholders. The Directors are, once again, seeking 10% share issuance authority at the AGM. As with the buy 
back authority, this authority would expire at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2025.
The Board
As noted in the 2022 Annual Report, Dr. Woodward will stand down from the Board at the AGM. The Board 
therefore undertook a recruitment process seeking to appoint an additional independent non-executive Director and 
was pleased to announce the appointment of David Barron with effect from 1 October 2023. David has spent 25 
years working in the investment management sector and was until November 2019 Chief Executive Officer of Miton 
Group PLC following six years with the firm. Prior to this he was Head of Investment Trusts at JP Morgan Asset 
Management for more than ten years having joined Robert Fleming in 1995. David will stand for election at the 
upcoming AGM. On Dr Woodward's departure from the Board, Andrew Watkins will become Chair of the Audit 
Committee and Emma Davies Senior Independent Director. It is my intention to stand down at the 2025 AGM, at 
which time David will replace me as Chair. The Board intends to undertake a recruitment process next year and 
anticipates appointing a further Director by 30 September 2024.
The Board wishes to thank Dr Woodward for his many years of commitment, service, energy and insight and, in 
particular, for his assiduity and experience in the role of Chairman of the Audit Committee.

Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held at 11 a.m. on 18 January 2024 at the Institute of Directors, 116 Pall Mall, London, SW1Y 
5ED. The Managers will make a presentation and I look forward to meeting shareholders who are able to attend. To 
accurately reflect the views of shareholders of the Company, the Board intends to hold the AGM voting on a poll, 
rather than by a show of hands as has been customary. This will ensure an exact and definitive result. The Board 
encourages all shareholders to exercise their votes on the AGM resolutions by completing and submitting the form 
of proxy enclosed with the Annual Report to ensure that your votes are represented at the meeting (whether or not 
you intend to attend in person).
If you hold shares through a share platform or other nominee, the Board encourages you to contact these 
organisations directly as soon as possible to arrange for you to submit votes in advance of the AGM. Alternatively, 
the Association of Investment Companies' ('AIC') website theaic.co.uk/how-to-vote-your-shares has information on 
how to vote your shares if you hold them via one of the major platforms. The following link will also take you through 
to the AIC website where there is information on how your platform can help you attend the AGM in person 
theaic.co.uk/aic/ready-to-invest/shareholder-voting/attending-an-agm.
Should shareholders have questions for the Board or the Managers, or any queries as to how to vote, they are 
welcome, as always, to submit them by email to trustenquiries@bailliegifford.com or call 0800 917 2112.
Information on the resolutions can be found on pages 110 and 111 of the Annual Report. The Directors consider 
that all resolutions to be put to shareholders are in their and the Company's best interests as a whole and 
recommend that shareholders vote in their favour.
Outlook
Fund managers are nearly always prone to regard the current environment as difficult. It is no exaggeration, 
however, to describe the present geopolitical turmoil and deterioration in the fabric and harmony of both democratic 
and autocratic societies as troubling and unusual. 25 years of unprecedented and arguably reckless money printing 
has come home to roost. Adding value in anticipating big picture change either good or bad is difficult, even 
accepting an element of reflexivity: one thing leads to another. Inflation leads to falling living standards and, 
historically, wars. The good news, as ever, is in the degree of innovation, disruption and commercial success that 
can flow from human ingenuity. Stock-picking in the form of focussing on what might go right is the best way to 
explore and mine this seam. Growing, high quality companies delivering goods and services that enhance their 
customers' lives are worthy of attention and investment. Our Managers are adept at this activity. They have been 
sticking to their guns. In this we support them.

Managers' Report
We took over management of the Company four years ago with the aim of investing in Europe's most dynamic 
growth companies. Since then, the share price has experienced a spectacular rise and equally spectacular fall. 
Adjusted for the share split, we started at just over 80p, peaked at around 170p, and ended the current period 
almost where we started. While we continually ask ourselves what we could have done differently, Baillie Gifford 
has been managing European portfolios since 1985 and has experienced poor performance before. Many of our 
most successful companies have been through similarly difficult bouts. Just as those companies did, we emerged 
from each one in a stronger position. We do not wish to downplay the recent period of poor performance. We think 
about it every
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
day. Disappointing as this is, however, it is more important to consider where the share price will be five years from 
now.
Over short periods there are many variables that help dictate what a company is worth. These include interest 
rates, risk appetite, social media, and many of the behavioural shortcomings from which we humans regularly 
suffer. Companies make mistakes too - operational hiccups happen. These are businesses run by real people trying 
to navigate complex issues and unpredictable events. Over longer periods of time, however, these variables play a 
far less significant part. What is more important for value creation is a strong, durable corporate culture, and the 
ability to grow profitably over time. We will make mistakes, but if we build and maintain a portfolio of high-quality 
growing businesses run by people we trust, we believe that we can deliver for our shareholders.
Performance
Over the last financial year, the Company's NAV delivered a total return of 8.3% while the FTSE Europe ex UK 
index returned 20.5% in sterling terms. The Company's share price total return was 8.6%, ending the period at 
83.6p, representing a discount of 13.6% to the NAV. This compares to a discount of 13.5% at the beginning of the 
period.
Despite these relative returns, we are increasingly optimistic about the future. Operational progress has been at 
least in line with our expectations, and we are seeing many affirming signals that our companies are taking 
advantage of this environment, investing while peers retrench, carrying out acquisitions, and buying back shares. 
We are not the only ones who think the selloff is overdone.
Positive contributors in the period include Ryanair, which continued to take market share from weaker airlines and 
invest in new capacity. Online classified companies Adevinta and its major shareholder Schibsted showed that they 
can offset temporarily weaker volumes with price increases. Both companies' share prices have also been boosted 
by news that a private equity consortium is looking to acquire Adevinta. Freight forwarder DSV and building 
materials manufacturer Kingspan continue to execute well, and both have been linked with potential large-scale 
acquisitions made feasible by their strong balance sheets. Spotify continues to grow healthily and now boasts over 
550m monthly active users. After much investment, its recent focus has shifted to profitability using cost reductions 
and price increases as levers. This shift is underway at many technology companies, although Spotify is the first to 
be rewarded by the market.
Some companies performed less well. Battery startup Northvolt was written down to reflect moves in public 
benchmarks, though operational progress remains good. Elsewhere, payments processing company Adyen fell 
almost 50% in the week after announcing some market share losses in the US. This looks temporary to us, though 
we continue to monitor progress and debate the attractiveness of the new, lower valuation. Sartorius Stedim 
Biotech, which manufactures bioprocessing equipment for the biologics industry, also reported negative news, 
noting a slowdown in demand and higher inventories. Again, these issues feel temporary, and
we have made a modest addition. Swedish gaming company Embracer has been more disappointing. The 
investment case centred on the founder's strategy of acquiring media content and gaming studios and letting their 
founders flourish in a decentralised organisation. Unfortunately, this was a case of overpromising and 
underdelivering, and management is now being forced to sell assets to pay down debt. We have some sympathy 
for the idea that the company is now undervalued, but we have lost faith in the management team and the board. 
Trust in management and alignment are non-negotiable for us so we have sold our entire position.
Improving performance
We genuinely believe that the future looks brighter than the past. Cynics may argue that this is what all 
underperforming fund managers say, so the onus is on us to explain the underpinnings of our optimism. So, what 
are the catalysts to drive improving performance?
Cognitive psychologist Gary Klein, in his book 'Seeing What Others Don't', suggests that performance is improved 
by 'reducing errors and increasing insights'. As we have written before, our main error has been misjudging the 
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
impact of rapidly shifting monetary policy on the valuations of growth companies. Because the companies in the 
portfolio tend to be smaller and grow much faster than average, most of their lifetime cashflows are in the future, 
and these are now being discounted at a much higher rate than they were. We have therefore felt the impact of 
rising rates much more acutely. When panic sweeps the market,
it is the more nascent, higher growth companies that get hit hardest.
In order to minimise future valuation risk, we monitor interest rate and duration risk in the portfolio and construct a 
reverse discounted cashflow model for every company we look at. These process tweaks will help us test our 
assumptions on valuation, but also to take advantage of opportunities in a volatile market. This is crucial - the 
potential upside is much greater than the potential downside, so while minimising errors is important, it is less 
important than identifying insights to help us invest today in tomorrow's winners.
Insights
"Insights shift us toward a new story, a new set of beliefs that are more accurate, more comprehensive, and more 
useful. Our insights transform us in several ways. They change how we understand, act, see, feel, and desire."
- Gary Klein
We strive to identify insights. We look for new ways of seeing companies, truths that others are perhaps less able to 
see, potential that the market is not currently discounting. This is how one outperforms the market over the long 
term. Klein suggests that insights are often generated through pattern recognition and making connections as a by-
product of coincidence or curiosity. Insights can also come from contradictions and inconsistencies. When we come 
across things that don't make sense, we need to build new mental models to understand what is going on. For us 
this is happening more and more when thinking about company valuations.
We have underperformed over the past two years - this simple observation is irrefutable. Interest rates have risen, 
and valuation multiples have fallen. However, here's the contradiction: over the past two years, the forward price-to-
earnings multiple of our portfolio has fallen by 50%, from 34x to 17x*, which is a 40% premium to the index we are 
trying to outperform. If you believe sell-side analysts, earnings per share (EPS) of our portfolio are expected to grow 
12% per annum over the next three years which compares favourably to 4% per annum for the index. At those 
rates, the valuation multiple of our portfolio would be below that of the index within five years, although we would be 
disappointed if it wasn't sooner. This doesn't make any sense to us. The companies we invest in typically grow 
faster than the index and we would expect this to continue for far longer than five years. We think they are higher 
quality, have unique corporate cultures, have less debt, and are run by some of the best capital allocators in 
Europe. Things can always get cheaper but even the idea that our portfolio would trade at a discount to the index in 
a few years highlights just how inefficient the market is at valuing growth.
So, what's going on? Part of the explanation could be related to hyperbolic discounting. This is a complicated 
sounding way of saying that future profits are being excessively discounted. We are reminded of the 1972 Stanford 
marshmallow experiment, led by psychologist Walter Mischel, which set out to measure a child's willingness to 
defer gratification. Children would often choose to devour one marshmallow immediately rather than wait fifteen 
minutes to receive two. This desire to experience immediate rewards at the expense of bigger rewards in the future 
plagues markets as much as children.
As long-term investors, we believe that the market tends to underestimate the attractiveness of special companies 
over long periods. This inefficiency becomes much more acute during times of stress, when time horizons shrink, 
risk appetite diminishes, and a premium is placed on certainty. It's no great surprise, then, that market breadth has 
narrowed sharply since 2021. Many have sought refuge in the perceived safety of the largest companies in the 
index regardless of their fundamentals or valuations. We've long believed that the midcap space in Europe contains 
a high proportion of future outliers, but this view is increasingly at odds with what the market is pricing in. This won't 
last forever, so we believe that this is the time to be adding to those stocks where we see asymmetric payoffs.
Portfolio
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
Portfolio turnover for the year was 9%, implying an average holding period of just over 10 years. During the second 
half of our financial year, we made six new investments in public companies: EQT, one of the world's largest and 
most reputable private equity firms; LVMH and Moncler, two luxury goods companies that are getting better as they 
get bigger; Soitec, an innovative French semiconductor company exposed to rapidly growing markets; Royal 
Unibrew, a multi-beverage company with serial acquirer characteristics; and Eurofins, a global lab testing business 
we've been waiting patiently to buy for many years. We also made a new investment in an unlisted Italian software 
company called Bending Spoons, which has a unique approach to monetising consumer mobile apps. This is a 
diverse, high-quality, highly profitable collection of companies growing much faster than the market, with meaningful 
inside ownership and attractive valuations.
During the same period, to make way for these new holdings, we completely sold five investments. We have 
already mentioned Embracer, but food delivery firm Just Eat Takeaway.com and green holding company Aker 
Horizons didn't work out either. Just Eat Takeaway.com suffered from an ill-timed acquisition in the highly 
competitive US market. Legislators also introduced fee caps which effectively turned a profitable business into a 
loss making one. With Aker Horizons we underestimated how difficult it would be for its portfolio of clean tech 
businesses to generate profits. MedTech distributor Addlife, and heat pump manufacturer NIBE, have been more 
successful. During the Covid pandemic, Addlife benefitted from increased demand for diagnostics and hospital 
equipment, while demand for NIBE's energy efficient heat pumps far exceeded supply during the energy crisis. In 
both cases we determined that valuations had risen too much, and that the capital would be best redirected into 
better ideas.
Private companies
While the Company can invest up to 20% of total assets in private companies, we currently have five investments 
accounting for around 11%: Northvolt (4.9%), McMakler (1.8%), sennder (1.8%), Flix (1.5%) and Bending Spoons 
(0.9%). Overall operational progress has been good and both Northvolt and Flix are rumoured to be considering an 
initial public offering ('IPO') in 2024.
We think giving investors low-cost access to private companies that would otherwise be unavailable is an attractive 
proposition. Companies are staying private for longer, as many of them are relatively asset light and therefore 
require little capital to grow. As a result, many are in the fortunate position to be able to choose their investors. We 
think our reputation as long-term growth investors and our ability to invest in both private and public markets mean 
we are advantaged when it comes to deal flow. We absolutely believe that investing in Europe's increasingly 
dynamic private companies can generate significant value and provide insights into a level of disruption not 
normally seen in public markets.
Northvolt
Our very first private investment is becoming increasingly important to us and the broader European economy. 
Northvolt was founded in 2016 by two former Tesla executives backed by two Swedish entrepreneurs who wanted 
to accelerate decarbonisation. Their mission was to produce the world's greenest batteries with the lowest carbon 
footprint. In just seven years, the company has taken on over 4,000 employees, secured more than $8bn in funding, 
and received more than $55bn in orders from customers like BMW, VW, Scania, Siemens and ABB. This is truly 
remarkable.
At 4.9% it is the largest position in the portfolio, so its success will help underpin any rebound in performance. The 
rumoured IPO in 2024 is just a milestone for us if it happens as we can continue holding the shares if there remains 
sufficient upside. Either way it should be very high profile particularly given its strategic importance to Europe's 
automotive industry, politicians, and financial institutions who all want to see it succeed. Europe cannot afford to 
rely on Asian battery manufacturers. It needs to build its own supply chain and Northvolt is the best chance we 
have.
Northvolt's opportunity is large and growing. In Europe alone, battery demand is expected to increase from around 
150GWh in 2022 to 1,370GWh in 2030. This is likely to be revised upwards as new markets and applications 
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
emerge. We suspect this will be a commoditised market, but Northvolt's strategy seems well-suited. Important 
aspects of this strategy include:
· An ambition to lower the carbon footprint of a battery to 10kg of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt hour, a 90% 
reduction from the current industry benchmark. This will be driven by access to very cheap renewable hydroelectric 
power, using responsibly sourced raw materials, and using at least 50% recycled material.
· Its unique vertical integration. Everything from cathode production to cell assembly to recycling will be done in-
house. This not only lowers carbon emissions but also helps capture more recycled materials and improves quality.
· A European supply chain. A local champion needs local supply, and Northvolt's aim is to source 90% of 
components from within Europe. This creates a lot of alignment with those customers and politicians responsible for 
orders and subsidies.
· A focus on talent. Northvolt has assembled one of the best R&D teams in the world. Battery chemistries and 
technological roadmaps will evolve so it is important that the company can adapt and compete with its Asian 
competitors.
During an investment trip to Sweden with the Board, we recently visited Northvolt's first factory, Northvolt Ett, in the 
small town of Skellefteå. The 200-hectare site near the Arctic Circle is equivalent to around 300 football pitches, so 
is a highly ambitious project. The current plan is to produce 150GWh of batteries by 2030, but there is upside 
potential to this figure. To put this into context, if the average electric car has a 70kWh battery, this would be 
enough to power more than 2 million of the 11 million cars sold in Europe in 2022. Using public estimates for battery 
prices in 2030, this could result in $10-15bn in sales. Engineering and manufacturing at this scale poses 
tremendous challenges, and there will no doubt be delays and setbacks. If Northvolt succeeds, however, the payoff 
for investors could be huge.
Outlook
Our investment style is very much out of favour, and we have undoubtedly made mistakes, but we have the right 
people and corporate culture at Baillie Gifford to persevere through this difficult time. There are plenty of geopolitical 
tensions and economic headwinds to worry about, but we must not let such factors overshadow the adaptability, 
innovation, and capital allocation of the companies we invest in. We are riding on the coat-tails of founders, families 
and management teams who are doing all the hard work. That this work is being so discounted by the market gives 
us confidence in a brighter outlook for returns from here.

Investments in securities are financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition. In 
accordance with FRS 102 the tables above provide an analysis of these investments based on the fair value 
hierarchy described below which reflects the reliability and significance of the information used to measure their fair 
value.
Fair value hierarchy
The levels are determined by the lowest (that is the least reliable or least independently observable) level of input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement for the individual investment in its entirety as follows:
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
Level 1 - using unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in an active market;
Level 2 - using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are directly or indirectly observable 
(based on market data); and
Level 3 - using inputs that are unobservable (for which market data is unavailable).
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies on pages 92 and 93 of the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis by valuation technique of the unlisted securities is 
on pages 104 and 105 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements.

The Company's shareholder authority permits it to hold shares bought back in treasury. Under such authority, 
treasury shares
may be subsequently either sold for cash (at a premium to net asset value per ordinary share) or cancelled. At 30

Articles of Association share buy-backs are funded from the capital reserve. The Company has authority to allot 
shares under section 551 of the Companies Act 2006. The Board has authorised use of this authority to issue new 
shares at a premium to net asset value per share in order to enhance the net asset value per share for existing 
shareholders and improve the liquidity of the Company's shares. During the year to 30 September 2023 no shares 
were issued (in the year to 30 September 2022 - no shares were issued).

Automatic Exchange of Information
In order to fulfil its obligations under UK tax legislation relating to the automatic exchange of information, the 
Company is required to collect and report certain information about certain shareholders.
The legislation requires investment trust companies to provide personal information to HMRC on certain investors 
who purchase shares in investment trusts. As an affected company, Baillie Gifford European Growth Trust will have 
to provide information annually to the local tax authority on the tax residencies of a number of non-UK based 
certificated shareholders and corporate entities.
Shareholders, excluding those whose shares are held in CREST, who come on to the share register will be sent a 
certification form for the purposes of collecting this information.
For further information, please see HMRC's Quick Guide: Automatic Exchange of Information - information for 
account holders gov.uk/government/publications/exchange-of-information-account-holders.

Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation ('SFDR')
The EU SFDR does not have a direct impact in the UK due to Brexit, however, it applies to third-country products 
marketed in the EU. As Baillie Gifford European Growth Trust is marketed in the EU by the AIFM, Baillie Gifford & 
Co Limited, via the National Private Placement Regime, the following disclosures have been provided to comply 
with the high-level requirements of SFDR. The AIFM has adopted Baillie Gifford & Co's Governance and 
Sustainable Principles and Guidelines as its policy on integration of sustainability risks in investment decisions.
Baillie Gifford & Co's approach to investment is based on identifying and holding high quality growth businesses 
that enjoy sustainable competitive advantages in their marketplace. To do this it looks beyond current financial 
performance, undertaking proprietary research to build an in-depth knowledge of an individual company and a view 
on its long- term prospects. This includes the consideration of sustainability factors (environmental, social and/or 
governance matters) which it believes will positively or negatively influence the financial returns of an investment. 
More detail on the Managers' approach to sustainability can be found in the Governance and Sustainability 
Principles and Guidelines document, available publicly on the Baillie Gifford website bailliegifford.com.
Taxonomy Regulation
The Taxonomy Regulation establishes an EU-wide framework of criteria for environmentally sustainable economic 
activities in respect of six environmental objectives. It builds on the disclosure requirements under SFDR by 
introducing additional disclosure obligations in respect of alternative investment funds that invest in an economic 
activity that contributes to an environmental objective. The Company does not commit to make sustainable 
investments as defined under SFDR. As such, the underlying investments do not take into account the EU criteria 
for environmentally sustainable economic activities.
Glossary of Terms and Alternative Performance Measures (APM)
An Alternative Performance Measure ('APM') is a financial measure of historical or future financial performance, 
financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial 
reporting framework. The APMs noted below are commonly used measures within the investment trust industry and 
serve to improve comparability between investment trusts.
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
Total assets
This is the Company's definition of Adjusted Total Assets, being the total value of all assets less current liabilities, 
before deduction of all borrowings.
Shareholders' funds
Shareholders' Funds is the value of all assets held less all liabilities, with borrowings deducted at book value.
Net asset value
Net Asset Value is the value of total assets less liabilities with borrowings deducted at either book value or fair value 
as described below. The net asset value per share (NAV) is calculated by dividing this amount by the number of 
ordinary shares in issue (excluding treasury shares).
Net asset value (borrowings at fair value) (APM)
Borrowings are valued at an estimate of market worth. The fair value of the Company's loan notes is set out in note 
19 on page 107 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements
.
A reconciliation from shareholders' funds (borrowings at book value) to net asset value after deducting borrowings 
at fair value is provided below.

number of ordinary shares in issue at the year end.
Net liquid assets
Net liquid assets comprise current assets less current liabilities, excluding borrowings.
Discount/premium (APM)
As stockmarkets and share prices vary, an investment trust's share price is rarely the same as its NAV. When the 
share price is lower than the NAV it is said to be trading at a discount. The size of the discount is calculated by 
subtracting the share price from the NAV and is usually expressed as a percentage of the NAV. If the share price is 
higher than the NAV, it is said to be trading at a premium.

* The dividend adjustment factor is calculated on the assumption that the dividends of 0.7p and 2.20p (2022 - final 
dividend 0.35p) paid by the Company during the year were reinvested into shares of the Company at the cum 
income NAV/share price, as appropriate, at the ex-dividend date.
The NAV (fair) total return for the period since Baillie Gifford began managing the portfolio in November 2019 can 
be calculated using the methodology shown in the table above and an opening NAV of 93.7p, a dividend 
adjustment factor of 1.0585 and a closing NAV of 96.7p.

Gearing (APM)
At its simplest, gearing is borrowing. Just like any other public company, an investment trust can borrow money to 
invest in additional investments for its portfolio. The effect of the borrowing on shareholders' funds is called 
'gearing'. If the Company's assets grow, shareholders' funds grow proportionately more because the debt remains 
the same. But if the value of the Company's assets falls, the situation is reversed. Gearing can therefore enhance 
performance in rising markets but can adversely impact performance in falling markets.
Gearing is the Company's borrowings adjusted for cash and cash equivalents expressed as a percentage of 
shareholders' funds.
Gross gearing is the Company's borrowings expressed as a percentage of shareholders' funds.
Leverage (APM)
For the purposes of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM) Regulations, leverage is any method which 
increases the Company's exposure, including the borrowing of cash and the use of derivatives. It is expressed as a 
ratio between the Company's exposure and its net asset value and can be calculated on a gross and a commitment 
method. Under the gross method, exposure represents the sum of the Company's positions after the deduction of 
sterling cash balances, without taking into account any hedging and netting arrangements.
Under the commitment method, exposure is calculated without the deduction of sterling cash balances and after 
certain hedging and netting positions are offset against each other.
Active share (APM)
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
Active share, a measure of how actively a portfolio is managed, is the percentage of the portfolio that differs from its 
comparative index. It is calculated by deducting from 100 the percentage of the portfolio that overlaps with the 
comparative index. An active share of 100 indicates no overlap with the index and an active share of zero indicates 
a portfolio that tracks the index.

Transparency Rules (the "Transparency Rules") and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/761 of 17 
December 2014.
   (ii) Full name of the legal entity and other identifying specification of the issuer or underlying 
issuer, provided it is reliable and accurate (e.g. address, LEI, domestic number identity).

   (iv) This should be the full name of (a) the shareholder; (b) the natural person or legal entity

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring 
temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
of Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person 
or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or 
legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity who has a life interest in shares if that

   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit

   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Holding(s) in Company -2-
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].
   (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be 
presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   EUROPE'S LOWEST FARES ARRIVE IN ALBANIA
   RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 200 WEEKLY FLIGHTS & 17 NEW ROUTES FOR WINTER '23
   Ryanair, Europe's biggest and lowest fares airline, today (8(th) Jun) announced 200 weekly flights and 
17 new routes to/from Albania as part of its Winter '23 schedule. Albania will become the 37(th) country 
within Ryanair's network, and will grant immediate access to key inbound tourism markets such as, Belgium, 
Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania Sweden and the UK - whilst also providing 
competitive fares and increased connectivity for Albanians who want to visit home or friends and family 
abroad.
   These exciting new Winter routes are only the beginning of what Ryanair can do to support the Albanian 
Government in delivering transformational growth within the tourism industry. Countries need major 
airlines of scale like Ryanair to deliver capacity growth -Ryanair has consistently and successfully 
demonstrated this in European economies which rely on tourism such as Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and 
Malta.
   Ryanair's new Albania Winter '23 schedule will deliver:
   --    17 new routes - to destinations such as Brussels, Dusseldorf, London, Manchester, Milan, Paris, 
Prague, Rome and Stockholm
    --    200 flights per week
    --    An estimated 700,000 passengers to/from Tirana (>1.5m p.a.)
    --    Over 1,000 local jobs
   With its recent record order of 300 new B737-MAX-10s, Ryanair will grow to c. 800 aircraft by 2033 and 
is the only major airline which can deliver long-term meaningful growth in Europe. Ryanair will begin 
operations to/from Albania this Winter offering 200 weekly flights, giving European and Albanian 
holidaymakers unbeatable choices at the lowest fares in Europe.
   To celebrate today's announcement, Ryanair will launch a 3-day seat sale on its 17 new routes to/from 
Tirana Airport from EUR29.99 one way for travel from Oct'23 until Mar'24, which must be booked by 11(th) 
June, available only at Ryanair.com.
   From Tirana, Ryanair DAC's CEO, Eddie Wilson said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC EUROPE'S LOWEST FARES ARRIVE IN ALBANIA
   "As Europe's largest airline, we are delighted to announce 200 weekly Ryanair flights to/from Albania 
starting from Winter '23. These initial 17 new routes will grant immediate access to key inbound tourism 
markets such as, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania Sweden, and the UK 
whilst also providing competitive fares and increased connectivity for Albanians who want to visit home, 
or friends and family abroad.
   We have worked closely with our partners here at Tirana Airport to launch these 17 new routes and hope 
to strengthen the relationship over time as we work together to drive inbound tourism and connectivity to 
Albania. These routes will allow millions of visitors from major cities across Europe to experience the 
wonders of Albania, from the white sand beaches of the Albania Riviera to the historical architecture of 
Unesco site Gjirokastër, and lively nightlife in Tirana.
   To celebrate today's announcement, we will launch a 3-day seat sale for these routes to/from Tirana 
Airport from EUR29.99 one way for travel from Oct'23 until Mar'24, which must be booked by 11(th) June, 
available only at Ryanair.com."
   Mr. Musa Kastrati, Senior Vice President of Kastrati Group, said:
   "On behalf of Tirana International Airport, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Ryanair for 
their remarkable trust in the potential of the Albanian market.
   We welcome Ryanair's decision to operate flights to and from Tirana International Airport, providing 
affordable and accessible air travel options, which will undoubtedly benefit both inbound and outbound 
travelers.
   I am confident that through the extensive network of Ryanair, Tirana International Airport will 
contribute to the further development of passenger choices, tourism, and the economy of Albania. We look 
forward to a fruitful partnership with Ryanair, as we work together to build memorable journeys for 
passengers traveling to and from our beautiful nation."

   RYANAIR WELCOMES SETTLEMENT OF US CLASS ACTION FOLLOWING MEDIATION
   Ryanair Holdings Plc today (7th June) confirmed that the US Class Action launched by the City of Birmingham 
Pension Fund in Nov 2018, has been settled following recent mediation between the parties. This settlement came 
after the US District Court in 2020 dismissed many of the claims made by the plaintiff, considerably narrowing the 
grounds for action.
   A spokesperson for Ryanair welcomed this settlement. The total settlement amount is $5m, which is considerably 
less than the legal costs that would have been incurred had this action gone all the way to trial. Ryanair contends 
there was no lawful basis for this claim, but that the settlement is in the interest of all shareholders due to the very 
modest settlement amount.
   The final settlement agreement will be subject to approval by the Court.

  2022 AGM Voting Update
  Ryanair Holdings plc today (23 February 2023) provided an update in respect of its 2022 AGM held on 15 Sept. 
2022. At that AGM, all resolutions were passed by the requisite majority. However, the Board noted that resolutions 
4(d) and 4(g) passed with a majority of less than 80% (both receiving votes in favour of approx. 73%).
   In accordance with the UK Corp. Governance Code, Ryanair wishes to update shareholders on actions taken by 
the Board. The Board has continued to engage with shareholders to further understand and discuss any concerns 
with respect to these resolutions. The Board is grateful to those shareholders who took the time to engage in these 
discussions and we received helpful feedback. From the consultations conducted both before and after the AGM, 
Ryanair has an understanding of the reasons why some shareholders were not supportive of these resolutions. The 
Board will continue to engage with shareholders, and will consider these views in its future decision making.
   ENDS.

   Social Chain operates Social Minds , a podcast dedicated to social media marketing. Recent guest 
speakers include the social media managers from Monzo, Ryanair and Innocent Drinks. The podcast generates 
approximately 14,000 downloads every month.
   For the financial year ending 31 December 2022, Social Chain is expected to generate revenues of 
GBP13.8 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of GBP0.1 million (unaudited). Over the last five years, 
Social Chain has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 14%, approximately doubling revenues of GBP7.1 
million in the financial year ended 31 December 2017.
   Social Chain is a subsidiary of The Social Chain AG, a listed German ecommerce corporate founded by 
Georg Kofler and Wanja Oberhof. Social Chain represents less than 10% of The Social Chain AG revenues, and 
as part of the transaction Brave Bison has acquired all applicable intellectual property associated with 
the Social Chain mark.
   As part of the acquisition, members of the senior management team at Social Chain will become option 
holders in Brave Bison. Up to 15 million share options will be issued over the next three years depending 
on performance.
   Sale and Purchase Agreement
   On 3 February 2023 the Company entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement ("Acquisition 
Agreement") with the Vendor pursuant to which the Company has conditionally agreed to acquire the entire 
issued share capital of Social Chain Limited for an initial consideration of GBP7.7 million. The Initial 
Consideration is subject to a working capital adjustment to reflect a normalised working capital position 
of GBP1.0 million.
   The Contingent Consideration of up to GBP9.5 million is payable over three years following completion 
of the Acquisition. In order for the maximum annual payment of approximately GBP3.2 million to become 
payable, Social Chain is required to achieve an annual EBITDA of more than GBP3.2 million, GBP4.0 million 
and GBP4.8 million, in Years 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
   Completion of the Acquisition Agreement will take effect on Admission.
   Details of the Placing and the Placing Agreement
   Under the terms of a placing agreement entered into today, 3 February 2023, between Cenkos and the 
Company (the "Placing Agreement"), Cenkos has conditionally agreed to use its reasonable endeavours to 
procure subscribers for the Placing Shares to raise GBP4.75 million.
   Cenkos has conditionally placed the Placing Shares with certain institutional and other investors at 
the Placing Price. The Placing is not being underwritten by Cenkos.
Brave Bison Group PLC Acquisition of Social Chain -2-
   The Placing has raised proceeds of GBP4.75 million through the Placing of the Placing Shares at the 
Placing Price. The Placing Price represents a discount of 3.4% to the volume weighted average price per 
Ordinary Share for the 60-day period ended 2 February 2023, being the latest practicable date prior to the 
date of this announcement.
   The Placing Shares will represent approximately 16.0% of the Company's enlarged issued ordinary share 
capital on Admission.
   The Placing is conditional, inter alia, on:
   --      The Placing Agreement not having been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to 
Admission of the Placing Shares to trading on AIM;
   --      The Acquisition Agreement not having been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to 
Admission.
   --      Admission becoming effective by no later than 8.00 a.m. on 6 February 2023 or such later time 
and/or date as the Company and Cenkos may agree (being no later than 8.00 a.m. on 20 February 2023).
   The Placing Agreement contains customary warranties given by the Company to Cenkos as to matters in 
relation to, inter alia, the accuracy of information in this Announcement and other matters relating to 
Brave Bison and its business. In addition, the Company has provided a customary indemnity to Cenkos in 
respect of liabilities arising out of or in connection with the Placing.
   Cenkos is entitled to terminate the Placing Agreement in certain circumstances prior to Admission 
including where any of the warranties are found not to be true or accurate or were misleading in any 
respect, the failure of the Company to comply in any material respect with any of its obligations under 
the Placing Agreement, the occurrence of certain force majeure events or a material adverse change in the 
business of the Group or in financial or trading position or prospects of the Group or the Company .
   Director Placing Participation
   Oliver & Theo Green (22.34% shareholders of the Company), Gordon Brough (0.05%) and Matt Law (together, 
the "Directors") have all subscribed for Placing Shares at the Placing Price under the Placing, as set out

  * 240,416,059 Ordinary Shares are held by Greenspan Investments Limited and 1,052,414 are held by Oliver 
Green in his own name
   For the reasons set out above, the participation by the Directors referred to above in the Placing is classified as a 
'related party transaction' for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules. Philippa Norridge, as the independent 
Director of the Placing, considers, having consulted with Cenkos (as the Company's nominated adviser), that the 
terms of the related party transaction are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are 
concerned.
   Admission, Settlement, Dealings and Total Voting Rights
   The Placing Shares will be issued credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu with the Company's existing 
Ordinary Shares. The Placing Shares are not being made available to the public and are not being offered or sold in 
any jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so.
   Application has been made for the Placing Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM and it is expected that 
settlement of the Placing Shares and Admission will occur at 8.00 a.m. on 6 February 2023.
   Following Admission of the Placing Shares, the Company's issued ordinary share capital will comprise 
1,287,337,739 Ordinary Shares, none of which are held in treasury. Therefore, following Admission of the Placing 
Shares, the total number of Ordinary Shares with voting rights in the Company will be 1,287,337,739, which may be 
used by the Company's shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they 
Brave Bison Group PLC Acquisition of Social Chain -2-
are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the Financial Conduct 
Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.
   The allotment and issue of the Placing Shares will not exceed the Company's existing authorities and no 
shareholder approval is therefore required.

"US Securities Act") or with any securities regulatory authority of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States 
and, accordingly, may not be offered, sold, resold, taken up, transferred, delivered or distributed, directly or

   RYANAIR EXPECTS TO REPORT STRONGER Q3.
   RAISES FY PROFIT GUIDANCE FROM EUR1.00BN - EUR1.20BN
   TO A NEW RANGE OF EUR1.325BN - EUR1.425BN.
   Ryanair Holdings plc today (4 Jan.) said it expects to report a stronger than expected Q3 (end 31 Dec.) 
PAT of close to EUR200m.  Strong pent-up travel demand over the holiday season for the first time in 3 
years, with no adverse impact from Covid or the war in Ukraine, stimulated stronger than expected peak 
Christmas/New Year traffic and fares.
   FY23 traffic guidance of 168m remains unchanged.  Ryanair expects Q4 to be loss making due to the 
absence of Easter from March, and a recent softening in UK outbound and Irish - Prov. UK traffic and 
pricing.
   As a result of these recent developments, Ryanair has raised its FY23 PAT guidance (pre-exceptionals) 
from a current range of EUR1.00bn - EUR1.20bn to a new range of EUR1.325bn - EUR1.425bn.  This guidance 
remains heavily dependent upon avoiding adverse events in Q4 (such as Covid or the war in Ukraine).
   As this is a closed period, the Ryanair Group's next market update will take place on Mon. 30 Jan. when 
the Group releases its Q3 results.

   These pay cuts will now be fully restored in the Irish pilots' December payroll and the agreement also 
incorporates 3 years of pay increases spread over the next 4 years up to March 2027. This agreement with 
Fórsa and Ryanair's Irish pilots was facilitated by discussions which took place on Fri 16(th) Dec at the 
Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).
   Ryanair's People Director, Darrell Hughes, said:
   "We welcome this pay restoration agreement with Fórsa and our Irish pilots which will see pay cuts 
previously agreed during Covid restored in the Dec payroll in time for Christmas.
   This agreement which includes annual pay increases for the next 4 years now brings our Irish pilots 
into line with similar pay restoration deals concluded with our other pilot unions across Europe over the 
past 9 months. We are grateful for the assistance of the WRC in reaching this sensible agreement with 
Fórsa and our Irish Pilots."

   easyJet's returns are underpinned by its strategic positions in slot-constrained airports where it competes 
predominantly against cost disadvantaged legacy carriers. The company has improved its position through the 
pandemic. Market share at Gatwick has increased from 40% to 50% through the reallocation of 16 planes (63 to 79) 
from less profitable bases. The impact of this could be seen over the summer quarter where revenue yield 
increased by 26% compared to 2019, well ahead of peers.
   Our view is that easyJet's brand, fleet and slot network command growing value. Wizz Air made an all-share 
approach for the company at GBP8 per share before easyJet issued GBP1.4bn new stock at GBP4 a share, and 
the stock now trades at GBP3.52. The company's GBP2.6bn value today is not far above its net assets of 
GBP2.5bn and less than capital employed of GBP3.2bn. The business has guided for a "mid-teens" return on 
capital employed, which we feel has the scope to be conservative given capacity rationalisation in the industry.
   Ryanair is leading sector consolidation as its capacity is 16% above pre-pandemic levels. In Italy, following the 
bankruptcy of Alitalia, Ryanair's market share has increased from 30% to 40%. The combination of increased scale 
benefitting unit costs and a supportive yield environment meant that profits over the summer quarter rose by 40% to 
EUR1.4bn compared to 2019. We feel that the company's valuation (9x earnings) is attractive given strong cash 
generation and forecast passenger growth of 8% per annum over the next 4 years.
   The Company's positions in UK housebuilders have suffered as housing demand has been impacted by rising 
interest rates. Our view is that the resulting decline in values fails to recognise the stability of industry cash 
generation, as land values adjust to house price changes, meaning that the economics of their business model is 
maintained through the cycle. Accounting earnings obscure this as land is accounted for on a historic cost basis. 
This means that in an environment of declining house prices, accounting earnings will fall but cash generation will 
rise.
   The industry entered this downturn in an entirely different position to the last, with no gearing and record 
contracted order books. The sector now trades on a 35% discount to its land value, which is close to the low of 
2008/9. As housebuilders typically buy land to achieve a 20%+ gross margin, this means house prices could 
decline substantially in nominal terms, and cash generated from landbanks alone would be far in excess of current 
value.

   Shelter is a basic necessity and the UK faces an accumulated housing deficit of c.1.5m homes. The demand for 
housing is deferred, not lost when it is not fulfilled. Affordability and pricing metrics may change, but the UK's 
requirement for more housing does not.
   Beneficiaries of higher interest rates
   Our holdings in UK retail bank franchises Lloyds and NatWest are amongst the clearest beneficiaries of higher 
interest rates. Zero interest rates robbed banks of pricing power as it was not viable to charge customers for their 
deposits. The return of positive nominal interest rates has allowed banks to earn margins on the liability side of their 
balance sheet as retail deposits are inert and insensitive to interest rate changes. NatWest and Lloyds both have 
approximately GBP480bn of deposits. An increase in deposit margins to 1% would increase interest income by 
GBP4.8bn, which is significant as the aggregate valuation of the two banks is GBP51bn.
   Companies with long-term liabilities will see a positive impact as discount rates cause values to fall. Currys has a 
pension deficit of GBP250m, accounting for nearly a third of its market value and to which it makes annual 
contributions of GBP78m. A 1% increase in discount rates in isolation, would reduce its pension deficit by 
GBP278m highlighting that equity value should stand to benefit from higher interest rates.
   Dignity's prepaid funeral business remains an underappreciated asset in the business. As of June, the company 
had GBP1,050m in trust, with an average duration of 10 years, and liabilities estimated to be GBP950m, which 
should fall as discount rates rise. The potential impact of an increase in the current surplus (GBP150m) to a 
company valued at GBP230m is significant.
   Dignity has made progress in its strategy to de-lever, announcing a transaction with bondholders. We believe this 
will reduce constraints placed on the business by the securitisation structure and serve to highlight the value of the 
company's crematoria division. Crematoria are desirable infrastructure assets with pricing power, high cash 
generation and barriers to entry. The company's enterprise value of GBP700m represents a multiple of 14x 
operating profit of the crematoria division alone, a notable discount to European infrastructure assets.
   Retaining conviction in out-of-favour digital winners
   The unique appeal of Nintendo's intellectual property (IP) has meant that software sales have remained robust 
despite the Switch console being over 5 years old. Digital penetration has increased from 34% to 50% over the last 
3 years, leading to a structural improvement in margins. The business is making progress in monetising its IP in 
new avenues such as theme parks, films and merchandise. We continue to find Nintendo to be attractively valued 
at 15x 2023 EPS (10x ex-cash) for the growth opportunities and duration it provides.
   Hobby product provider Hornby is starting to see the benefits of its investments to enable a digital-first direct-to-
consumer strategy. In the first two quarters of 2022/23, direct website sales increased by 54%. On a per unit basis, 
direct sales lead to a more than doubling of gross profit as Hornby captures the retail margin. Ongoing successful 
execution should lead to a substantial improvement in profitability and form deeper engagement with customers.
   Loss-making businesses have seen a ruthless reappraisal of their values as broader technology valuations have 
declined, impacting our investments in Just Eat Takeaway and Delivery Hero. The slowdown in industry volumes is 
distorted by pandemic base effects and obscures impressive structural growth. Demand for their services has 
expanded as the number of merchants on platforms has increased permanently. In recent quarters, platforms have 
demonstrated their profitability with focus shifting to improving efficiency and monetisation.

   Haelon is the largest personal care business globally owning brands in dental care (Sensodyne/Polident), 
vitamins (Centrum), and painkillers (Voltaren/ Panadol/Advil). It expects to grow revenues by 4-6% and earnings by 
c.8%. We believe guidance is achievable due to clear industry growth drivers in the form of demographics, self-
medication, and premiumisation, which are observable in peers (Colgate/P&G/Reckitts).
   The company was spun out from GSK in July at a price of 340p with the board having rejected an approach from 
Unilever in January at a see-through price of c.430p. We more than doubled our position in the stock at 250p after it 
fell sharply in response to concerns over potential Zantac-related litigation in August, at an attractive valuation of 
14x earnings.
   Berkeley Group is an unique business, a combination of property developer and house builder with a specific 
focus on Greater London. London is a structurally undersupplied market in the <GBP1m range. Since 2016, 
Berkeley has been focused on long-term regeneration sites. Sites can require up to 7-9 years and over GBP100m 
in capital before generating any revenues. In turn, the sites are very long-duration with the company noting in a 
recent meeting that they have acquired sites from National Grid that will still be producing homes in 2070.

   The company has an exceptional and long-duration land bank of 16 years with a stated undiscounted embedded 
development profit of over GBP8bn. We acquired a position in August when the stock's debt-free value was 
GBP4bn. Our view is that the company has scarcity and strategic value. Ongoing share repurchases at attractive 
values will further increase value on a per share basis.
   Vinci Group is a French industrial conglomerate which has existed for over 100 years. The company has 
consistently used cash flow from its contracting business to build and acquire infrastructure assets. Today, 70% of 
its value is accounted for by infrastructure assets (50% French toll roads and 20% airports) whilst 30% is from 
energy/construction contracting services.
   The company's infrastructure assets are high quality, scarce, and enjoy inflation-linked pricing. Toll roads are a 
regulated monopoly in France where pricing is set at 70% of CPI. Vinci has lower leverage than its peers (2.5x net 
debt/EBITDA) and has a weighted average debt maturity of 7 years with a fixed cost of 2.5%. We took advantage of 
its price declines to build a position at an attractive valuation of 11x free cash flow and with a prospective dividend 
yield of 4.5%.
   Although the Company did not take part in the funding round, Reaction Engines successfully raised GBP40m in 
September at our existing carrying value. The raise was led by a new investor and leaves the company in a strong 
liquidity position.

   UK CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY UPDATE ON RYANAIR ENFORCEMENT ACTION
   In January 2022, following action by the UK Civil Aviation Authority against Ryanair, the Court of Appeal decided 
that strike action by airline staff was not an 'extraordinary circumstance'. Following that judgment, Ryanair secured 
permission to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. It has now decided not to pursue this appeal and to 
provide compensation to passengers who were disrupted by the strike action taken by Ryanair pilots in 2018 in line 
with the passenger entitlements set out under UK (EC) Regulation 261/2004.
   Paul Smith, Consumer Director at the UK Civil Aviation Authority said: "The Civil Aviation Authority undertook 
enforcement action against Ryanair due to the belief that strike action by airline staff does not constitute an 
'extraordinary circumstance' and, as such, affected passengers should be entitled to compensation where this 
results in the delay or short notice cancellation of their flight. The judgment by the Court of Appeal supported this 
view.
   Ryanair's decision to discontinue the Supreme Court appeal of the Court of Appeal judgment means that affected 
passengers will now be able to make a claim for compensation from Ryanair if they were impacted by strike action 
taken by Ryanair pilots in 2018 and we would encourage all passengers on flights that were affected to claim the 
compensation they are entitled to.

   ANNE NOLAN TO JOIN BOARD OF RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC
   MICHAEL O'LEARY EXTENDS GROUP CEO CONTRACT TO JULY 2028
   Ryanair Holdings plc today (7 Dec.) announced the appointment of Ms. Anne Nolan (former Chair of the 
Irish Aviation Authority - IAA) to its Board as a NED.  The Group also confirmed that agreement has been 
reached with Group CEO, Michael O'Leary to extend his contract from July 2024 to July 2028.
   Anne Nolan - NED:
   The Board today announced the appointment of Ms. Anne Nolan as a non-executive director ("NED") with 
immediate effect.  Ms. Nolan is a former Chair of the IAA (from 2010 to 2018) and previously served as 
Chief Executive of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association.  She has also served on various Boards 
incl. the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the Irish Medicines Board, the Executive Committee of the 
European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and the Board of the Smurfit Graduate School of Business.
   Michael O'Leary - Group CEO:
   The Board confirmed (following some months of discussions with Michael O'Leary ("MOL") and extensive 
engagement with larger shareholders) that they have today agreed a contract extension which will see MOL 
remain as Group CEO until the end of July 2028 (previously July 2024). Under this extended contract the 
final vesting date for share options granted in 2019 will be extended to 2028 (from 2024), subject to MOL 
remaining in employment with the Group until July 2028 and delivering stretched performance targets (incl. 
raised PAT targets of up to EUR2.2bn  and/or a share price of EUR21) which will considerably reward all 
shareholders if these ambitious targets are delivered.  If these targets are not achieved then these share 
options will lapse and MOL will receive nothing other than his basic salary. An amended Remuneration 
Policy, reflecting these changes, will be tabled at Ryanair's 2023 AGM.
   Ryanair's Chairman Stan McCarthy said:
   "I am pleased to welcome Anne Nolan to the Board as Ryanair's newest NED.  Anne brings considerable 
aviation, business and regulatory experience to the role.  We all look forward to working with her over 
the coming years to achieve Ryanair's ambitious growth and environmental goals.
   The Board are also pleased that Michael O'Leary has agreed to extend his leadership of the Ryanair 
Group to July 2028.  During this time Michael will oversee the Group's growth to 225m passengers p.a. and, 
with Board support and oversight, develop the Group's strategy to the end of the decade.   This contract 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Anne Nolan To Join Board Of Ryanair Holdings PLC
extension, which involved extensive engagement with large shareholders and proxy advisors, is subject to 
the adoption of an amended Remuneration Policy which will be tabled at Ryanair's 2023 AGM."

   RYANAIR REPORTS HALF-YEAR PROFITS OF EUR1.37BN
   S.2022 TRAFFIC & FARES ABOVE S.2019 IN STRONG POST COVID RECOVERY
   RISK OF COVID VARIANTS & UKRAINE OVERHANG H2 WINTER SCHEDULES
   Ryanair Holdings today (7 Nov.) reported a strong half-year after tax profit of EUR1.37bn, compared to a pre- 
Covid (FY20) H1 profit of EUR1.15bn, due to record Q2 traffic, strong operational reliability and robust summer 
fares which in Q2 were 14% up on pre-Covid pricing.

    --    Net debt cut to EUR0.5bn at 30 Sep. (from EUR1.45bn at 31 Mar.).
   Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, said:
   ENVIRONMENT:
   "We continue to invest heavily in fuel efficient, environmentally friendly new aircraft technology.  
Passengers who switch to Ryanair (from high-fare EU legacy airlines) can reduce their emissions by up to 
50% per flight, proving that with Ryanair tourism growth can be delivered in a more sustainable manner.  
During S.22 we operated 73 new B737 "Gamechanger" aircraft, which deliver 4% more seats per flight yet 
burn 16% less fuel and cut noise emissions by up to 40%.
   We continue to invest to accelerate the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).  Our partnership 
with Trinity College's Sustainable Aviation Research Centre is now in its second year and its activity has 
ramped up significantly.  Building on the recent success of our partnership with Neste to power up to one 
third of our Schiphol flights (AMS) with a 40% SAF blend, we signed a long-term deal with OMV in Sep. to 
purchase up to 160,000 tonnes of SAF at Ryanair airports across Austria, Germany and CEE.  Ryanair hopes 
to power 12.5% of flights using SAF and cut our CO per pax/km by 10% to 60 grams by 2030.  As part of our 
carbon strategy, the Group recently concluded an agreement to retro-fit scimitar winglets on our 409 B737-
800NG fleet (an investment valued at over $200m).  This retro-fit program commences in W.22 and will 
further reduce fuel burn by 1.5%. Through A4E, and the EU, we are campaigning to accelerate reform of 
European ATC to eliminate needless flight delays, which will substantially reduce fuel consumption and CO 
emissions.
   In recognition of our progress to date and our industry leading (CDP 'B') climate rating, 
Sustainalytics [1] has ranked Ryanair the No.1 airline in Europe for ESG performance.  In June we 
submitted Ryanair's commitment letter to SBTi [2] and we will work with them over the next 2 years to 
verify our ambitious targets to become net carbon zero by 2050.
   SOCIAL:
   Pay restoration:
   At the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Ryanair and its union partners negotiated agreements to protect 
crew jobs via temporary pay cuts which were to be gradually restored from 2022 to 2025. These agreements 
successfully delivered job security through the 2 years of the Covid pandemic, as Ryanair maintained not 
only the jobs but also the licences of our crews.  This investment positioned Ryanair as the best prepared 
airline for the post-Covid traffic recovery.  By keeping our crews current, and recruiting early, Ryanair 
avoided the crew shortages which caused so many competitor cancellations and disruptions in Summer 2022. 
Since Spring 2022 we have worked with our union partners to negotiate accelerated pay restoration as part 
of long-term deals on pay and rosters which run until 2026 or 2027. Long-term agreements have, to date, 
been concluded to cover over 90% of our pilots and cabin crew.
   Under these long-term agreements, full pay restoration was brought forward by 24 months to Apr. 2023, 
subject to our business recovery.  However, following the Group's strong H1 financial and operational 
performance, we will now bring forward the full restoration of pay for all crews covered by these long-
term agreements to 1 Dec. 2022 (instead of Apr. 2023).  These crews will now receive their full pay 
restoration in the Christmas payroll. While considerable uncertainty hovers over the remainder of FY23, it 
has always been our priority to restore pay as soon as our business recovers. These long-term pay 
agreements with the vast majority of our people have now delivered fully restored pay 28 months earlier 
than previously agreed, and they will also deliver annual pay increases from 2024 until 2026 as we create 
thousands of new well-paid crew jobs and grow traffic to 225m p.a. by FY26.
   We have written today to the tiny minority of unions representing the less than 10% of pilots and cabin 
crew who have so far failed to reach agreements on accelerated restoration, urging them to return to 
negotiations. We look forward to concluding early agreements with them on similar terms to the existing 
negotiated agreements which will then cover all of our people.
   Training, Customer Panel & CSAT:
   Ryanair recently took delivery of the first of 8 new CAE full flight simulators (value over $80m).  We 
will expand our state-of-the art training facilities over the next 3-years and are close to selecting 
suitable locations for 2 new training centres (a EUR100m investment) in CEE and the Iberian Peninsula.  
Over recent months we've continued to invest in engineering and maintenance, and announced new hangar 
facilities in Malta, Kaunas (Lith.) and Shannon (Ire.).  These new facilities will enable us to create 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR REPORTS HALF-YEAR PROFITS OF EURO 1.37BN
more cadets and apprenticeships for school leavers, bringing through the next generation of highly skilled 
aviation professionals.
   Over 37,000 of our passengers recently applied to join our Customer Panel which has expanded to include 
reps from Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the UK.  The new Panel met 
in Dublin in Oct. and provided valuable insights and suggestions to help us to further improve Ryanair's 
offers and customer care.  While CSAT scores were impacted by numerous ATC delays/strikes this summer and 
lengthy airport security queues (particularly in Q1), Ryanair's operational resilience, reliability and 
friendly crew meant that we still recorded a very strong 83% rating across H1.
   OP. PERFORMANCE & GROWTH:
   Our Group airlines delivered an industry leading operations performance and robust post Covid traffic 
recovery in H1.  This summer we operated at 115% of our pre-Covid capacity, completed over 3,000 daily 
flights and delivered record traffic across peak S.22, despite unprecedented ATC disruptions and 
regrettable airport security delays (primarily in Q1).
   We had 73 Gamechangers in our fleet for peak S.22.  Our growth is being hampered by Boeing's inability 
to meet its delivery schedule in Q3, despite their previous assurances that Ryanair deliveries would be 
"prioritised". We expect Boeing will only deliver 10 or 12 of the contracted 21 Gamechangers due before 
Christmas.  Boeing assure us that they will deliver all scheduled 51 Gamechangers ahead of peak S.23, 
although there is a risk that some of these deliveries could slip.  We are planning FY24 growth based on 
51 extra aircraft for peak S.23 and we continue to recruit and train substantial numbers of pilots, cabin 
crew and engineers.  During H1, Ryanair announced 100 new routes for W.22 and most of our S.23 capacity is 
now on sale on www.ryanair.com . Our Routes teams continue to lock-in long term traffic recovery growth 
deals with airport partners across Europe which will reinforce Ryanair's market share growth and cost 
leadership in Europe.
   Over the past 3 years, numerous airlines went bankrupt and many legacy carriers (incl. Alitalia, TAP, 
SAS and LOT) significantly cut their fleets and passenger capacity, even while 'doping' on multi-billion-
euro State Aid packages.  These structural capacity reductions have created enormous growth opportunities 
for Ryanair to deploy our new, fuel efficient, B737 Gamechangers and as a result our market shares have 
surged across major EU markets.  Our reliability, lowest (ex-fuel) unit costs, very strong fuel and US$ 
hedges, fleet ownership and strong balance sheet ensures that the Group is well placed to grow 
profitability and traffic to 225m p.a. by FY26.
   H1 FY23 BUSINESS REVIEW:
   Revenue & Costs:
   H1 scheduled revenues increased almost 250% to EUR4.42bn as traffic recovered strongly from 39.1m to 
95.1m (at a 94% load factor).  Record Q2 traffic and strong peak summer fares (+14% over pre-Covid) offset 
a weak Easter in Q1, which saw traffic and fares damaged by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late Feb.  
Ancillary revenue delivered a solid performance with spend increasing to EUR23 per passenger.  Total 
revenue jumped by over 200% to EUR6.62bn.

   While sectors more than doubled and traffic increased 143%, operating costs rose just 126% to EUR4.98bn 
(incl. a 205% increase in fuel to EUR2.18bn), driven by lower variable costs, higher load factors and 
improved fuel burn from our Gamechanger fleet.  Cost per passenger (ex-fuel) fell below EUR30 in H1 
(slightly lower than the same period pre-Covid).
   Our FY23 jet fuel requirements are 81% hedged at an ave. of $67bbl and during H1 we raised our FY24 jet 
fuel hedges to 50% at approx. $93bbl.  Forex is also well hedged with over 80% of FY23 EUR/$ opex hedged 
at 1.14 and almost 20% of FY24 hedged at 1.08.  Our Boeing order book is fully hedged at EUR/$ 1.24 out to 
FY26.  This very strong hedge position helps insulate Ryanair from recent spikes in fuel prices and the 
US$ and gives our Group airlines a huge cost advantage over our EU competitors, especially this winter and 
into FY24.
   Balance Sheet & Liquidity:
   Ryanair's balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry with a BBB (stable) credit rating (S&P 
and Fitch).  Net debt at 30 Sep. has fallen to EUR0.5bn (from EUR1.45bn at 31 Mar.), despite EUR0.9bn 
capex.  Almost all of the Group's fleet of B737s are owned and over 90% are unencumbered which widens our 
cost advantage at a time when interest rates and leasing costs of our competitors are rising. Our focus 
over the next year is the repayment of EUR1.6bn of maturing bonds while returning our balance sheet to a 
broadly zero net debt position. The strength of our balance sheet ensures that the Group is well 
positioned to exploit the many growth opportunities that are currently emerging as we grow to 225m 
passenger p.a. by FY26.
   RECESSION & PRICE INFLATION:
   Concerns about the impact of recession and rising consumer price inflation on Ryanair's business model 
have been greatly exaggerated in recent months.  As the lowest cost producer in Europe, we expect to grow 
strongly in a recession as consumers won't stop flying, but rather they will become more price sensitive.  
Like Aldi, Lidl, Ikea and other price leaders our very strong post Covid recovery shows that price will 
continue to drive market share gains as we add low cost, more fuel efficient, aircraft to our fleet over 
the next 4 years.  As Europe recovers from the 2-year Covid pandemic there has been a considerable 
contraction of short haul capacity, much of which will not return in the medium term.  Most of our EU 
competitors have cut capacity by up to 20% this Winter while Ryanair will offer 10% more seats than pre-
Covid.
   As our H1 traffic and market share growth shows, millions of passengers are switching to fly with 
Ryanair for our lower prices, our industry leading reliability and our greener, fuel efficient aircraft. 
Consumer propensity to travel remains high in Europe as a result of full employment, rising wages and 2

years of pent-up-demand and accumulated savings while people were 'locked up' during Covid.  We expect 
these strong fundamentals will continue to underpin robust traffic and ave. fare growth for the next 18-
months at least, and Ryanair will be the main beneficiary of these trends so long as there are no negative 
developments this Winter such as Covid variants or Ukraine.
   OUTLOOK:
   The recovery for the remainder of FY23 remains fragile and could yet be impacted by new Covid variants 
or adverse geopolitical events such as Ukraine.  However forward bookings (both traffic and fares) remain 
strong over the Oct. school mid-terms and into the peak Christmas travel period.  We hope to avoid any 
repeat of last year's Omicron lockdowns which damaged last Christmas at such short notice. As is normal, 
at this time of year, we have almost zero visibility into Q4 which is traditionally our weakest quarter 
and which this year doesn't have any Easter benefit.
   While we remain dependent on Boeing meeting their delivery commitments, especially for Christmas extras 
and Spring mid-term, we are modestly raising our FY23 traffic guidance to 168m passengers (previously 
166.5m), up 13% on our pre-Covid traffic.  We remain hopeful that full-year fares will remain ahead of 
FY20 (pre-Covid) by a mid-to-high single digit percentage but we remain cautious that yields could be 
impacted at very short notice in H2 as they were last year by Omicron in late Nov. which damaged Christmas 
and the Ukraine invasion on 24 Feb. which so clearly damaged Mar. and Apr. traffic.  If we are fortunate 
to avoid such negative events like Covid and Ukraine in H2 then, thanks to our very strong traffic 
recovery, our advantageous fuel and currency hedges and our widening cost and market share leadership over 
competitors, we are hopeful that we will minimise our winter losses which would enable us to deliver an 
FY23 PAT (pre-exceptionals) in a range of EUR1.00bn to EUR1.20bn.  This cautious guidance will remain 
hugely dependent on not suffering adverse events this Winter (as we did last, which were clearly beyond 
our control)."

associated with environmental, safety and security measures, the availability of appropriate insurance 
cover, actions of the Irish, U.K., European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective 
regulatory agencies, post-Brexit uncertainties, weather related disruptions, ATC strikes and staffing 
related disruptions, delays in the delivery of contracted aircraft, fluctuations in currency exchange 
rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the 
airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the U.K. and Continental Europe, the 
general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political factors, global 
pandemics such as Covid-19 and unforeseen security events.

   Independent review report to Ryanair Holdings plc
   Report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements
   _________________________________________________________________________
   Our conclusion
   We have reviewed Ryanair Holdings plc's condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the 
"interim financial statements") in the half-yearly financial report of Ryanair Holdings plc for the period 
ended September 30, 2022 (the "period").
   Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim 
financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International 
Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the European Union and the 
Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the Central Bank (Investment Market Conduct) 
Rules 2019.
   The interim financial statements comprise:
    --          the condensed consolidated interim balance sheet as at September 30, 2022 on page 1;
   --          the condensed consolidated interim income statement and condensed consolidated interim 
statement of comprehensive income for the six months then ended on pages 2 and 4;

   Revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to maintenance programmes, changes in 
utilisation of the aircraft, governmental regulations on ageing aircraft, changes in new aircraft 
technology, changes in governmental and environmental taxes, changes in new aircraft fuel efficiency and 
changing market prices for new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. The Group therefore 
evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each reporting period, and, when warranted, adjusts these 
assumptions. Any adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.
   The Group evaluates, at the end of each reporting period, whether there is any indication that its 
long-lived assets may be impaired. Factors that may indicate potential impairment include, but are not 
limited to, significant decrease in the market value of an aircraft based on observable information, a 
significant change in an aircraft's physical condition and operating or cash flow losses associated with 
the use of the aircraft.
    3.            Seasonality of operations
   The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly, 
the first half-year has traditionally resulted in higher revenues and profits.
    4.            Income tax expense
   The Group's consolidated tax expense for the half-year ended September 30, 2022 of EUR159M (tax credit 
September 30, 2021: EUR52M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR7M and a deferred tax charge of EUR152M 
primarily relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment and net operating 
losses.  This consolidated tax charge is the aggregation of separate tax charges and tax credits on the 
profits earned and losses suffered by each of the Group's operating companies calculated in accordance 
with differing tax rules and rates applicable in each jurisdiction where the Group operates.  No 
significant or unusual tax charges or credits arose during the period.  The effective tax rate of 11% for 
the half-year (September 30, 2021: 52%) is the result of the mix of profits and losses incurred by 
Ryanair's operating subsidiaries primarily in Ireland, Malta, Poland and the U.K.
    5.            Contingencies
   The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management 
believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to materially 
adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.

    6.            Capital commitments
   At September 30, 2022 the Group had an operating fleet of 486 (2021: 438) Boeing 737 and 29 (2021: 29) 
Airbus A320 aircraft. In September 2014, the Group agreed to purchase up to 200 (100 firm and 100 options) 
Boeing 737-8200 aircraft which was subsequently increased to 210 (135 firm and 75 options). In December 
2020, the Group increased its firm orders from 135 to 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft. At September 30, 2022 
the Group had taken delivery of 77 of these aircraft. The remaining aircraft are due to be delivered 
before the end of fiscal year 2025.
    7.            Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis
   The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the Group CEO, who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).
   The Group comprises five separate airlines, Buzz, Lauda Europe (Lauda), Malta Air, Ryanair DAC and 
Ryanair UK Limited (which is currently included within Ryanair DAC). Ryanair DAC is reported as a separate 
segment as it exceeds the applicable quantitative thresholds for reporting purposes. Malta Air is reported 
as a separate segment as it exceeded the applicable quantitative thresholds for reporting purposes for the 
year ended March 31, 2022, and is included for comparative purposes. Buzz and Lauda do not individually 
exceed the quantitative thresholds and accordingly are presented on an aggregate basis as they exhibit 
similar economic characteristics and their services, activities and operations are sufficiently similar in 
nature. The results of these operations are included as 'Other Airlines.'
   The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the profit/(loss) after tax of each airline 
for the reporting period. Resource allocation decisions for all airlines are based on airline performance 
for the relevant period, with the objective in making these resource allocation decisions being to 
optimise consolidated financial results.
   Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

  Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   MD&A Half-Year Ended September 30, 2022
   Introduction
   The Ryanair Group's fleet was effectively grounded due to European Governments' Covid-19 travel restrictions/ 
lockdowns for much of the prior year comparative (notably the months of April to June).  Sectors (+105%) and traffic 
(+143%) are therefore significantly higher in the half-year ended September 30, 2022. The following discussion 
should be read in that context.
   For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") (with the exception of the balance sheet 
commentary) all figures and comments are by reference to the half-year ended September 30, 2022 results 
excluding the exceptional item referred to below.
   The Group, as part of its risk management strategy, has utilised jet fuel call options to set a maximum price for 
approximately 16% of FY23 expected fuel requirements. These instruments are measured at fair value through the 
income statement. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the price of jet fuel significantly 
increased and remains volatile. An exceptional unrealised mark-to-market loss of EUR107M (post-tax) was 
recorded on the Group's jet fuel call options at September 30, 2022. This is effectively an unwind of the cumulative 
EUR132M (post-tax) unrealised mark-to-market gain recorded at periods ended March 31, 2022 (EUR114M) and 
June 30, 2022 (EUR18M).
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues increased by 248 % to EUR4.43BN due to a 143% increase in traffic, from 39.1M to 95.1M 
and 43% higher average fares (a 7% increase on the same period pre Covid-19).
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues increased by 149% to EUR2.19BN as traffic grew (up 143%) and guests increasingly choose 
discretionary services such as priority boarding, reserved seating and in-flight sales.
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues rose 207% to EUR6.62BN.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil increased by 205% to EUR2.18BN due to a 105% increase in sectors and significantly higher jet fuel 
prices offset by fuel burn savings on the new B737-8200 aircraft.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges rose by 106% to EUR693M, well below the 143% increase in traffic.
   Staff costs:
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR REPORTS HALF-YEAR -5-
   Staff costs increased by 93% to EUR584M due to the larger fleet and ramp up of activities, the roll-off of Covid-19 
payroll support schemes and the commencement of pay restoration during the period.
   Route charges:
   Route charges increased by 119% to EUR503M, ahead of the increase in sectors, due to higher Eurocontrol and 
ATC rates (despite a degradation in the quality of the services provided by ATC agencies during the half-year, 
particularly during peak Summer 2022).
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation increased by 35% to EUR453M, primarily due to higher amortisation resulting from increased aircraft 
utilisation (as sectors rose by 143%) and the delivery of 57 new Boeing 737-8200 "Gamechanger" aircraft.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other rose by 118% to EUR367M due to higher activity (including increased in-flight 
sales and credit card transactions).
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 70% to EUR200M due to higher aircraft utilisation and the 
extension of 24 A320 aircraft leases to 2028 during the period.
   Other expense:

   These 
unaudited 
condensed 
consolidated 
interim 
financial 
statements 
("the 
interim 
financial 
statements"), which should be read in conjunction with our 2022 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 
2022, have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU ("IAS 
34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements and should 
be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated financial statements of the Group. The 
consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended March 31, 2022, are available 
at http://investor.ryanair.com/ .
   In adopting the going concern basis in preparing the interim financial statements, the Directors have 
considered Ryanair's available sources of finance including access to the capital markets, sale, and 
leaseback transactions, secured and unsecured debt structures, the Group's cash on-hand and cash 
generation and preservation projections, together with factors likely to affect its future performance, as 
well as the Group's principal risks and uncertainties.
   The September 30, 2022 figures and the September 30, 2021 comparative figures do not constitute 
statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The 
consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2022, together with the 
independent auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the 
Company's Annual General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on 
those financial statements was unqualified.
   The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the unaudited 
condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the half-year ended September 30, 2022 on November 
4, 2022.
   Except as stated otherwise below, this year's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
   New IFRS standards and amendments adopted during the year
   The following new and amended IFRS standards, amendments and IFRIC interpretations, have been issued by 
the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the 
Group's financial year beginning on April 1, 2022 and therefore have been applied by the Group in these 
condensed consolidated interim financial statements:

   The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on the Group's financial 
position or results in the half-year ended September 30, 2022.
   New IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
   The following new or amended standards and interpretations will be adopted for the purposes of the 
preparation of future financial statements, where applicable.  While under review, we do not anticipate 
that the adoption of the other new or revised standards and interpretations will have any or a material 
impact on our financial position or performance:

   --    Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (effective on or after 
January 1, 2024).*
   * These standards or amendments to standards are not as of yet EU endorsed.
    2.            Judgements and estimates
   In preparing these condensed interim financial statements, management has made judgements and estimates 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
   In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the most recent published 
consolidated financial statements.
   Derivative financial instruments
   The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, 
including the risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates. Ryanair uses 
forward contracts for the purchase of its jet fuel (jet kerosene) and carbon credit (Emission Trading 
Scheme) requirements to reduce its exposure to commodity price risk. It also uses foreign currency forward 
contracts to reduce its exposure to risks related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar 
exposure associated with the purchase of new Boeing 737-8200 aircraft and the U.S. dollar exposure 
associated with the purchase of jet fuel.
   The Group's derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and recognised as either assets 
or liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet. All derivatives, with the exception of jet fuel call 
options, are designated as cash flow hedges with the resulting gains or losses taken to other reserves. 
Jet fuel call options are measured at fair value with the resulting unrealised gains or losses taken to 
the income statement. At September 30, 2022, a net asset of EUR465M (2021: net asset of EUR238M) was 
recognised on balance sheet in respect of the Group's jet fuel forward contracts, jet fuel call options, 
foreign currency derivative instruments associated with future jet fuel purchases and carbon credits and a 
net asset of EUR705M (2021: net asset EUR247M) was recognised in respect of its foreign currency 
derivative instruments associated with future aircraft purchases.
   In determining the hedge effectiveness of derivative instruments used to hedge Ryanair's fuel 
requirements, there is significant judgement involved in assessing whether the volumes of jet fuel hedged 
are still expected to be highly probable forecast transactions. Specifically, significant judgement is 
required in respect of the assumptions related to the expected recovery of passenger demand and the 
subsequent flight schedules following the Covid-19 pandemic along with the potential for travel 
restrictions to be reimposed. All of these assumptions impact upon forecast fuel consumption, and minor 
changes to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
   In respect of foreign currency hedge effectiveness for future aircraft purchases, there is a high 
degree of judgement involved in assessing whether the future aircraft payments are still considered highly 
probable of occurring, and the timing of these future payments for aircraft. The timing of future payments 
for aircraft is dependent on the aircraft manufacturer's ability to meet forecast aircraft delivery 
schedules.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR REPORTS HALF-YEAR -7-
   As at September 30, 2022 the Group had entered into forward jet fuel hedging contracts covering 
approximately 66% of its estimated requirements for fiscal year 2023 (with a further 16% covered by jet 
fuel call options) and approximately 50% of its estimated requirements for fiscal year 2024. The Group 
believes these hedges (excluding the jet fuel call options) to be effective for hedge accounting purposes.
   Long-lived assets - Useful lives, residual values and impairment
   As at the half-year ended September 30, 2022, the Group had EUR9.28BN of property, plant and equipment 
long-lived assets, of which EUR9.11BN were aircraft and capitalised maintenance. In accounting for long-
lived assets, the Group must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected 
residual values of the assets, the cost of major airframe and engine overhaul.
   In determining the useful lives and expected residual values of the aircraft, and the cost of major 
airframe and engine overhaul, the Group has based the estimates on a range of factors and assumptions, 
including its own historic experience and past practices of aircraft disposal and renewal programmes, 
forecasted growth plans, external valuations from independent appraisers, recommendations from the 
aircraft supplier and manufacturer and other industry available information.
   The Group's estimate of each aircraft's residual value is 15% of the current market value of new Boeing 
737 aircraft, and each aircraft's useful life is determined to be 23 years. An element of the cost of an 
acquired aircraft is attributed on acquisition to its service potential, reflecting the maintenance 
condition of its engines and airframe. This cost, which can equate to a substantial element of the total 
aircraft cost, is amortised over the shorter of the period to the next maintenance check (usually between 
8 and 12 years) or the remaining life of the aircraft.

   Net finance expenses decreased 19% to EUR36.2M due to lower net debt (at mainly fixed interest rates), 
offset by higher cash balances and rising deposit interest rates. Foreign exchange translation was 
negatively impacted by the movement of the EUR/US$ exchange rate on balance sheet revaluations.
   Balance sheet:
   Gross cash increased by EUR966M to EUR4.59BN at September 30, 2022.
   Gross debt increased by EUR60M to EUR5.14BN, primarily due to the extension of lease terms on 24 A320 
aircraft at lower rentals, offset by debt repayments during the period.
   Net debt was EUR546M at September 30, 2022. This is a EUR0.91BN reduction from EUR1.45BN at March 31, 
2022.

   Shareholders' equity increased by EUR1.11BN to EUR6.67BN in the period primarily due to a EUR1.27BN net 
profit and an IFRS hedge accounting unrealised loss for derivatives of EUR170M.
   MD&A Quarter Ended September 30, 2022
   Introduction
   Traffic during the prior period comparative (quarter ended September 30, 2021) improved following the 
rollout of EU Digital Covid Certificates in July, 2021 however the Group still experienced a significant 
reduction in traffic as a result of European Government's Covid-19 travel restrictions/lockdowns. Sectors 
(+38%) and traffic (+60%) are therefore significantly higher in the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The 
following discussion should be read in that context.
   For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") (with the exception of the balance 
sheet commentary) all figures and comments are by reference to the quarter ended September 30, 2022 
results excluding the exceptional item referred to below.
   The Group, as part of its risk management strategy, has utilised jet fuel call options to set a maximum 
price for approximately 16% of FY23 expected fuel requirements. These instruments are measured at fair 
value through the income statement. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the price 
of jet fuel significantly increased and remains volatile. An exceptional unrealised mark-to-market loss of 
EUR125M (post-tax) was recorded on the Group's jet fuel call options at September 30, 2022.  This is 
effectively an unwind of the cumulative EUR132M (post-tax) unrealised mark-to-market gain recorded at 
periods ended March 31, 2022 (EUR114M) and June 30, 2022 (EUR18M).
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR REPORTS HALF-YEAR -6-
   Scheduled revenues increased by 163% to EUR2.85BN due to a 60% increase in traffic, from 31.0M to 49.5M 
and 65% higher average fares (a 14% increase on the same quarter pre Covid-19).
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues increased by 66% to EUR1.17BN as traffic grew (up 60%) and guests increasingly 
choose discretionary services such as priority boarding, reserved seating and in-flight sales.
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues rose 125% to EUR4.01BN.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil increased by 106% to EUR1.14BN due to a 38% increase in sectors flown and significantly 
higher jet fuel prices offset by fuel burn savings on the new B737-8200 aircraft.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges rose by 42% to EUR356M, well below the 60% increase in traffic.
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs increased by 61% to EUR309M due to the larger fleet, the ramp up of activities, the roll-
off of Covid-19 payroll support schemes and the commencement of pay restoration during the period.
   Route charges:
   Route charges increased by 43% to EUR254M, ahead of the increase in sectors, due to an increase in 
Eurocontrol and ATC rates (despite a degradation in the quality of the services provided by ATC agencies 
during the quarter).
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation increased by 12% to EUR227M, primarily due to higher amortisation resulting from increased 
aircraft utilisation (as sectors rose 38%) and the delivery of 57 new Boeing 737-8200 "Gamechanger" 
aircraft.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other rose by 101% to EUR194M due to higher activity (including increased 
in-flight sales and credit card transactions).
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 100% to EUR112M due to higher aircraft utilisation and 
the extension of 24 A320 aircraft leases to 2028 during the quarter.
   Other expense:
   Net finance expenses decreased 31% to EUR16M due to lower net debt (at mainly fixed interest rates), 
offset by higher cash balances and rising deposit interest rates. Foreign exchange translation was 
negatively impacted by the movement of the EUR/US$ exchange rate on balance sheet revaluations.

   Interim Management Report
   Introduction
   This financial report for the half-year ended September 30, 2022 meets the reporting requirements 
pursuant to the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and Transparency Rules of the 
Central Bank of Ireland.
   This interim management report includes the following:
   -- Principal risks and uncertainties relating to the remaining six months of the year;
   -- Related party transactions; and
   -- Post balance sheet events.
   Results of operations for the six-month period ended September 30, 2022 compared to the six-month 
period ended September 30, 2021, including important events that occurred during the half-year, are set 
forth above in the MD&A.
   Principal risks and uncertainties for the remainder of the year
   The Group's recovery remains fragile and prone to shocks from any adverse Covid-19 developments. The 
full extent of such developments on the Group's longer-term operational and financial performance, many of 
which may be outside of the Group's control, are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
   Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and the subsequent spike in oil prices, has created 
another unexpected development which will overhang our industry until it is resolved.
   Among other factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected 
results for the remainder of the year are the airline pricing environment, capacity growth in Europe, fuel 
costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the replacement of aircraft, costs 
associated with environmental, safety and security measures, the availability of appropriate insurance 
coverage, actions of the Irish, U.K., European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective 
regulatory agencies, delays in the delivery of contracted aircraft, supply chain disruptions/delays, 
weather related disruptions, ATC strikes and staffing related disruptions, uncertainties surrounding 
Brexit, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour 
relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR REPORTS HALF-YEAR -6-
the U.K., and Continental Europe, including the risk of a recession or significant economic slowdown, the 
general willingness of passengers to travel, other economic, social and political factors and unforeseen 
security events.
   Board of Directors
   Details of the members of the Group's Board of Directors are set forth on page 17 of the Group's 2022 
annual report. Julie O'Neill retired from the Board in September 2022.
   Related party transactions - Please see note 11.
   Post balance sheet events - Please see note 12.
   Going concern
   The Directors, having made inquiries, believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for at least the next 12 months and that it is appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing these interim financial statements. The continued preparation of the Group's 
consolidated interim financial statements on the going concern basis is supported by the financial 
projections prepared by the Group.
   In arriving at this decision to adopt the going concern basis of accounting, the Board has considered, 
among other things:
   --      The Group's net profit (pre-exceptional items) of EUR1.37BN in the half-year ended September 
30, 2022;
   --      The Group's liquidity, with almost EUR4.60BN cash at September 30, 2022, a EUR0.91BN reduction 
in net debt during the period (despite EUR0.90BN in Capex) and the Group's continued focus on cash 
management;
   --      The Group's solid BBB credit ratings combined with a stable outlook (from both S&P and Fitch 
Ratings);
    --      The Group's strong balance sheet position with over 90% of its B737 fleet unencumbered;
   --      The Group's access to the debt capital markets, unsecured/secured bank debt and sale and lease 
back transactions;
    --      Ongoing cost reductions across the Group;
   --      The Group's strong fuel hedging position (FY23 fuel requirements are over 80% hedged and 
approximately 50% of FY24 jet fuel requirements are hedged); and
   --      The Group's ability, as evidenced throughout the Covid-19 crisis, to preserve cash and reduce 
operational and capital expenditure in a downturn.

Management Report included in the half-yearly report on pages 7 to 12 do not form part of the interim 
financial statements.
   The interim financial statements included in the half-yearly financial report have been prepared in 
accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the 
European Union and the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the Central Bank 
(Investment Market Conduct) Rules 2019.
   As disclosed in note 1 to the interim financial statements, the financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in the preparation of the full annual financial statements of the Group is applicable law, 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and IFRSs as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board.
   _____________________________________________________________________________________
   Basis for conclusion
   We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (Ireland) 2410, 
'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity' ("ISRE 
(Ireland) 2410") issued for use in Ireland. A review of interim financial information consists of making 
enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical 
and other review procedures.
   A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (Ireland) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would 
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion.
   We have read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and considered whether 
it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the interim 
financial statements.

   _____________________________________________________________________________________________
   Conclusions relating to going concern
   Based on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described 
in the Basis for conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the 
Directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting or that the Directors have 
identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that are not appropriately disclosed.
   This conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (Ireland) 2410. 
However future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
   _____________________________________________________________________________________________
   Responsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review
   Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
   The half-yearly financial report, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility of, 
and has been approved by, the Directors. The Directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly 
financial report in accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the 
Central Bank (Investment Market Conduct) Rules 2019. In preparing the half-yearly financial report 
including the interim financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or 
to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
   Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the half-yearly 
financial report based on our review. Our conclusion, including our Conclusions relating to going concern, 
is based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in the Basis for 
conclusion paragraph of this report. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company for the purpose of complying with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 
2007 and the Central Bank (Investment Market Conduct) Rules 2019 and for no other purpose. We do not, in 
giving this conclusion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.

  Ancillary revenues comprise of revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, in-flight sales and 
Internet related services. Non-flight scheduled revenue arises from the sale of priority boarding, 
allocated seats, car hire, travel insurance, airport transfers, room reservations and other sources, 
including excess baggage charges and other fees, all directly attributable to the low-fares business.
   The vast majority of ancillary revenue is recognised at a point in time, which is typically the flight 
date. The economic factors that would impact the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and 
cashflows associated with the provision of passenger travel related ancillary services are homogeneous 
across the various component categories within ancillary revenue. Accordingly, there is no further 
disaggregation of ancillary revenue required in accordance with IFRS 15, paragraph 114.
    8.            Property, plant and equipment and Right of Use assets
   Acquisitions and disposals
   During the half-year ended September 30, 2022, net capital additions amounted to EUR0.7BN principally 
reflecting aircraft deliveries in the period, aircraft pre-delivery deposits and capitalised maintenance 
offset by supplier reimbursements of approximately EUR128M. Right of Use assets (reflecting A320 aircraft 
operating lease extensions to 2028) increased by EUR114M in the period.
    9.             Financial instruments and financial risk management
   The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
   These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2022 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the period.
   Fair value hierarchy
   Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
   --     Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
the Group can access at the measurement date.
   --     Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    --     Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
   Fair value estimation
   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
   Financial instruments measured at fair value
   --     Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine 
their fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. The Group's credit risk and 
counterparty's credit risk is taken into account when establishing fair value (Level 2).
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR REPORTS HALF-YEAR -9-
   --     Derivatives - currency forwards, jet fuel forward contracts and carbon contracts: A comparison 
of the contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at September 30, 
2022 has been used to establish fair value. The Group's credit risk and counterparty's credit risk is 
taken into account when establishing fair value (Level 2).
   --     Derivatives - jet fuel call options: T he fair value of jet fuel call options is determined 
based on market accepted valuation techniques, primarily Black-Scholes modelling (Level 2).
   The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, 
there were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
    --     Financial instruments not measured at fair value
   --     Long-term debt: The repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at the 
relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at September 30, 2022 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
   As at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, the future outlook for the business is such 
that there has been no material change to the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities.
   The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated balance sheet, are as follows:

   During FY22:
    --    Ryanair's CDP [1] climate protection rating improved from "B-" to "B".
    --    Sustainalytics [2] ranked Ryanair the No.1 EU airline & No.2 World airline for ESG.
    --    Traffic recovered strongly to 97.1m from 27.5m.  (Still 35% behind pre-Covid)
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
    --    Ave. fares fell 27% to just EUR27 due to Covid, Omicron & the Ukraine invasion.
    --    61 B737-8200 "Gamechangers" delivered up to 31 Mar. (500 SH aircraft at year-end).
    --    770 new routes & 15 new bases were announced for the coming year.
    --    Fuel well hedged at significant discount to spot prices (FY23 80%; H1 FY24 10%).
    --    S.22 capacity at 115% of S.19 (pre-Covid) levels - but recovery is 'fragile'.
   Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, said:
   ENVIRONMENT:
   "Every consumer who switches to Ryanair from EU legacy airlines can cut their CO emissions by up to 50% 
per flight.  Over the coming 5-years we expect our traffic to grow by 50% to 225m p.a.  This growth will 
be delivered at lower fares but on a fleet of new B737 "Gamechanger" aircraft, which offer 4% more seats, 
yet burns 16% less fuel and reduce noise emissions by 40%.
   Our work with the EU, fuel suppliers, and aircraft manufacturers to accelerate sustainable aviation 
fuel (SAF) supply continues, in partnership with Trinity College's Sustainable Aviation Research Centre.  
Ryanair hopes to power up to 12.5% of our flights using SAF and cut our CO per pax/km by 10% to under 60 
grams by 2030.  Last month we announced a partnership with Neste to power up to one third of our flights 
from Schiphol  (Amsterdam) with a 40% SAF blend.  We expect to establish similar partnerships across our 
network over the coming years.  We are working with A4E and the EU to accelerate reform of the Single 
European Sky, to promote ATC efficiency and cut delays which will reduce fuel consumption, CO emissions 
and flight delays.
   Ryanair published our "Aviation with Purpose" sustainability report setting ambitious environmental and 
social targets over the coming decade and mapping out Ryanair's path to net carbon zero by 2050.  Our 
environmental strategy has enabled CDP to upgrade Ryanair's climate protection rating to B from B- in Dec. 
2021.  Our goal remains to achieve an "A" rating within the next 2 years.  Last month, Sustainalytics 
improved Ryanair's ESG rankings to No.1 airline in Europe and the No.2 globally.
   SOCIAL:
   Our growth plans to 2026 will see Ryanair create over 6,000 well-paid jobs for highly skilled aviation 
professionals all over Europe.  Last autumn Ryanair invested EUR50m in a cutting-edge Aviation Skills 
Training Centre in Dublin and we plan to invest over EUR100m in 2 more, high skills, training centres (one 
in the Iberian Peninsula and one in CEE) during this period.  To facilitate this growth, Ryanair ordered 
up to 8 CAE full flight simulators (at a value of over $80m) and the first of these new sims delivers this 
summer.  We have also invested in new hangar maintenance facilities in Kaunas and Shannon and agreed a 5-
year maintenance contract with Joramco in Jordan.
   Despite the recent disruption of our traffic recovery by both the Omicron variant and the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine, we remain committed to restoring the pay cuts we agreed with our people during the 
Covid shut downs. We have made some progress with pilots and cabin crew in certain markets on partial 
restorations in 2022.  But, in other markets the slow pace of union negotiations have hindered this 
acceleration of similar restorations. We remain committed to delivering the first tranche of our agreed 3-
year restoration plan as agreed in July 2022 and we are prepared to accelerate years 2 and 3 into one 
restoration in July 2023 if Ryanair returns to pre-Covid load factors and profitability during y.e. Mar. 
2023.  We are committed to the full pay restoration for all our people as soon as our business returns to 
pre-Covid profitability.
   The Ryanair Customer Panel met twice over the last year, providing valuable insights and constructive 
suggestions to improve our customer service.  We have implemented many of these suggestions, including a 
Day of Travel service in the Ryanair App which assists our guests with live updates through every step of 
their journey, a new travel wallet for accelerated refunds and an online self-service hub.  Later this 
summer we will introduce more service improvements, including auto check-in and airport express to 
facilitate faster journeys through airports. Our winning formula of the lowest fares, the most on-time 
flights, industry lowest CO emissions and friendly customer service saw Ryanair's customer satisfaction 
("CSAT") scores rise significantly in FY22.
   EU OWNERSHIP & CONTROL:
   Ryanair's EU ownership has increased from approx. 32% at 31 Mar. 2021 to approx. 41% at 31 Mar. 2022.  
In the wake of Brexit, and the treatment of UK nationals as non-EU shareholders from 1 Jan. 2021, Ryanair 
has worked hard to grow its EU shareholder base.  During the past year, Ryanair increased its EU investor 
relations activity, delisted from the London Stock Exchange, and forced sell downs where non-EU investors 
incorrectly (post 1 Jan. 2021) purchased ordinary shares instead of ADRs (listed on NASDAQ) and who 
subsequently failed to comply with a Ryanair issued disposal notice.  Such actions, coupled with a 
suspension of voting rights of non-EU shareholders, enable Ryanair to protect its EU airline licenses 
post-Brexit.  We expect these voting restrictions will remain in place for the near-term future until a 
50%+ EU shareholding is restored, or the EU and UK agree a less restrictive airline ownership and control 
regime than the current 50%+ nationality rule (which dates back to the 1940s).
   GROWTH:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
   Over the past year our New Route team continued to work with airport partners to negotiate lower costs, 
Covid recovery incentives and growth deals.  In addition to 15 new bases (Agadir, Billund, Chania, Corfu, 
Cork, Madeira, Newcastle, Nuremberg, Riga, Stockholm, Venice (Marco-Polo), Venice (Treviso), Turin, Zadar 
& Zagreb), 770 new routes were announced and low-cost long term growth deals were extended at London 
Stansted (to 2028), Milan Bergamo (2028), Manchester (2028), East Midlands (2028) and Brussels Charleroi 
(2030).  Our Group has doubled its capacity in Rome (FCO), Lisbon, Vienna and has based a record 33 
aircraft in Dublin for S.22, launching our biggest ever Dublin summer schedule.
   The Covid-19 crisis accelerated the collapse of many European airlines including Flybe, Norwegian, 
Germanwings, Level, Stobart and material capacity cuts at many others including Alitalia (now ITA), TAP, 
LOT, SAS, etc.  The tsunami of State Aid from EU Govts. to their insolvent flag carriers (Alitalia, Air 
France/KLM, Iberia, LOT, Lufthansa, SAS, TAP and others) will distort EU competition and prop up high 
cost, inefficient, flag carriers for some years.  Ryanair was one of very few airlines during the Covid 
crisis to place significant new aircraft orders, to expand our airport partnerships, secure lower costs so 
that we can pass on even lower fares on many new routes during the post Covid recovery.  Over the past 2 
years, Ryanair's  market share has increased markedly across Europe.  Notable examples include Italy where 
our market share increased from c.30% (pre-Covid) to almost 40% this summer.  Market share in Vienna has 
jumped from 8% (S.19) to 21% (S.22).  In Budapest (a competitor's home base) we have gone from 18% to over 
30% (and market leadership), Ireland rose from 49% to over 55%, Sweden doubled to 12% and Poland has grown 
from 25% to 35%.
   Up to March 2022, Ryanair has taken delivery of 61 B737-8200 "Gamechanger" aircraft and we hope to 
increase this to over 70 new aircraft for peak S.22 (more than the 65 previously targeted) to facilitate 
S.22 recovery and growth opportunities.  This Summer, our capacity will grow to approx. 115% of S.19 (pre-
Covid) levels although we expect to fill these flights with lower fares and at higher fuel costs than pre-
Covid.  Our new, fuel efficient, "Gamechangers" widen the cost gap between Ryanair and all other European 
airlines for the next decade.  Their operational reliability, lower fuel consumption and CO emissions have 
so far exceeded expectations, with very positive feedback from both passengers and our crews.  Based on 
our 210 order book and available fleet capacity, the Ryanair Group plans to accelerate traffic growth over 
the next 5 years.  From a pre-Covid figure of 149m, we now expect to grow (by 50%) to over 225m guests 
p.a. by FY26.

   FY22 scheduled revenues increased 156% to EUR2.65bn.  While traffic recovered strongly from 27.5m to 
97.1m guests, the delayed relaxation of EU Covid-19 travel restrictions until July 2021 (Oct. in the case 
of the UK Govt.), combined with the damaging impact of the Omicron variant and Russia's invasion of 
Ukraine in H2, meant that fares required significant price stimulation.  Ave. fares in FY22 were down 27% 
to just EUR27.  Ancillary revenue delivered a solid performance, generating more than EUR22 per passenger 
as traffic recovered and guests increasingly chose priority boarding and reserved seating.  Total revenues 
increased by over 190% to EUR4.80bn.
   While sectors increased almost 200% and traffic rose 253%, operating costs rose just 113% to EUR5.27bn 
(incl. a notable 237% increase in fuel to EUR1.83bn), driven primarily by lower variable costs such as 
airport & handling, route charges and lower fuel burn as 61xB737 Gamechangers entered the fleet (offset by 
the higher cost jet fuel).  Lower costs, coupled with rising load factors, saw FY22 (ex-fuel) unit cost 
per passenger reduce to EUR35.
   Our FY23 fuel needs are approx. 80% hedged (65% jet swaps at c.$63bbl and 15% caps at c.$78bbl).  
Almost 10% of Ryanair's H1 FY24 fuel requirements are hedged at c.$76bbl (via jet swaps). Carbon credits 
are 85% hedged for FY23 at EUR53 (well below the current spot price of almost EUR90).  This very strong 
fuel hedge position  gives Ryanair a considerable competitive advantage for the next 12 months and will 
enable us to grow market share strongly over the coming year.
   Balance Sheet & Liquidity
   Ryanair's balance sheet is one of the strongest in our industry with a BBB (stable) credit rating (S&P 
and Fitch).  Year-end net debt fell to EUR1.45bn (prior year EUR2.28bn), and over 90% of the Group's fleet 
of B737 aircraft are unencumbered.  We plan to reduce this net debt to zero over the next 2 years, despite 
peak capex during that time.  The strength of Ryanair's balance sheet ensures that the Group is well 
poised to capitalise rapidly on the many growth opportunities that exist in Europe into the post Covid-19 
recovery this year and beyond.
   OUTLOOK:
   While bookings have improved in recent weeks, the booking curve remains much closer-in than was typical 
(pre-Covid) at this time of year.  The damaging impact of the Omicron variant, and Russia's invasion of 
Ukraine in Feb. means that Q1 pricing continues to need stimulation.  There is, however, pent-up demand 
and we are cautiously optimistic that peak S.22 fares will be somewhat ahead of peak S.19 (pre-Covid) 
levels.  Ryanair plans to grow FY23 traffic to 165m (up from 97m in FY22 and 149m pre-Covid) and will 
pursue its load active, yield passive strategy to achieve this growth.  While 80% of Ryanair's fuel 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -2-
requirements are hedged well below current spot prices of over $100bbl, our unhedged 20% will give rise to 
some unbudgeted cost increases.
   Despite limited H1 visibility (and almost zero H2 visibility), 20% unhedged fuel and the significant 
risks posed by both the invasion of Ukraine and Covid, we hope to return to reasonable profitability in 
FY23.  This recovery, however, remains fragile.  This was clearly evidenced by the sudden, and unexpected, 
emergence of the Omicron variant pre-Christmas and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in Feb., both of which 
immediately damaged close-in bookings and yields for the Christmas and Easter peak travel periods.  Given 
the continuing risk of adverse news flows on both these topics, it is impractical (if not impossible) to 
provide a sensible or accurate profit guidance range at this time".

Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
  MD&A Year Ended March 31, 2022 ("FY22")
   Introduction
   The Ryanair Group's fleet was effectively grounded as a result of European Governments' Covid-19 travel 
restrictions/lockdowns for much of the prior year comparative (year ended March 31, 2021).  Sectors 
(+197%) and traffic (+253%) are therefore significantly higher in the year ended March 31, 2022 (although 
still below pre Covid-19 levels) and the following discussion should be read in that context.
   For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") (with the exception of the balance 
sheet commentary) all figures and comments are by reference to the FY22 results excluding the exceptional 
item referred to below.
   In FY22, as part of its risk management strategy, the Group utilised jet fuel call options to set a 
maximum price for up to 15% of FY23 expected fuel requirements. These instruments are measured at fair 
value through the income statement. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the price 
of jet fuel significantly increased. An exceptional (pre-tax) unrealised mark-to-market gain of EUR131M 
was recorded on the Group's jet fuel call options at March 31, 2022.
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues increased by 156% to EUR2.65BN due to a 253% increase in traffic, from 27.5M to 
97.1M. While traffic increased significantly, the delayed relaxation of EU Governments' Covid-19 travel 
restrictions until July 2021 (October in the case of the UK Government) combined with the damaging impact 
of the Omicron variant and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in H2, meant that fares required significant price 
stimulation. Average fares in FY22 were down 27% to just EUR27.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues increased by 258% to EUR2.15BN due to a 253% rebound in traffic and a solid 
performance in priority boarding and reserved seating.
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues increased by 193% to EUR4.80BN.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil increased by 237% to EUR1.83BN due to a 197% increase in sectors and higher jet fuel 
prices offset by fuel burn savings on the new B737-8200 aircraft.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges rose by 183% to EUR813M, below the 197% increase in sectors and 253% 
higher traffic.
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation increased by 26% to EUR719M, primarily due to higher amortisation resulting from increased 
aircraft utilisation and the delivery of 61 new B737-8200 "Gamechanger" aircraft.
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs increased by 46% to EUR690M due to higher sectors.
   Route charges:
   Route charges rose by 194% to EUR551M, broadly in line with higher sectors.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other doubled to EUR411M due to higher activity (including increased in-
flight sales), offset by cost savings.
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 24% to EUR256M due to higher aircraft utilisation and 
the handback of 3 leased aircraft during FY22.
   Other expense:
   Net finance expenses increased by EUR38M to EUR91M due to higher average gross debt in the year and 
negative interest rates on euro deposits.
   In the prior year, due to an 81% reduction in traffic and aircraft delivery delays, the Group recorded 
approximately EUR200M ineffectiveness charges on fuel and currency hedges. No hedge ineffectiveness was 
recorded in FY22.
   Balance sheet:
   Gross cash increased by EUR0.48BN to EUR3.63BN at March 31, 2022.
   Gross debt fell by EUR0.35BN to EUR5.08BN primarily due to EUR1.72BN debt repayments offset by a 
EUR1.20BN bond issuance in May 2021.
   Net debt was EUR1.45BN at March 31, 2022, a drop of EUR0.83BN from EUR2.28BN at March 31, 2021.
   Increased activity in the twelve months to March 31, 2022 (including a 197% increase in sectors and 
253% rise in traffic), and higher forward bookings (unearned revenue) led to significant movements in 
Other Assets (+EUR0.24BN), Trade Payables (+EUR0.56BN), and Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities 
(+EUR1.72BN).
   Shareholders' equity:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
   Shareholders' equity increased by EUR0.90BN to EUR5.54BN primarily due to a EUR1.08BN IFRS hedge 
accounting unrealised gain for derivatives, offset by the EUR0.24BN net loss.

   Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
   Preliminary Financial Statements
    1.         Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
   Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated preliminary financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2022 comprise 
the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
   The March 31, 2022 figures and the March 31, 2021 comparative figures do not include all of the 
information required for full annual financial statements and therefore do not constitute statutory 
financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2021, together with the independent 
auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual 
General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
   The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the unaudited 
condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 on May 13, 2022.

Body
   The Group's consolidated tax credit for the year ended March 31, 2022 of EUR189M (March 31, 2021: 
EUR94M) comprises a current tax credit of EUR10M and a deferred tax credit of EUR179M primarily relating 
to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment and net operating losses. This consolidated 
tax credit is the aggregation of separate tax charges and tax credits on the profits earned and losses 
suffered by each of the Group's operating companies, calculated in accordance with differing tax rules and 
rates applicable in each jurisdiction where the Group operates. The effective tax rate of approximately 
44% credit for the year ended March 31, 2022 (March 31, 2021: approximately 8% credit) is the result of 
the mix of profits and losses incurred by Ryanair's operating subsidiaries primarily in Ireland, Malta, 
Poland and the UK, and revised assessments of the value of deferred tax assets in the wake of the Covid-19 
pandemic.
    5.         Share based payments
   The terms and conditions of the Group's share-based remuneration programmes are disclosed in the most 
recent, published, consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR9M in the year ended March 31, 2022 
(March 31, 2021: EUR4M) is the fair value of options granted in prior periods and a conditional share 
grant under LTIP 2019, in fiscal year 2022, to managers across the Group (the Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors were not included in this LTIP grant). The charge is recognised within the income statement in 
accordance with employee services rendered. During the year ended March 31, 2022, 6.5M ordinary shares 
were issued at strike prices between EUR6.25 and EUR12.00 per share following the exercise of vested share 
options.
    6.         Contingencies
   The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
    7.         Capital commitments
   At March 31, 2022 the Group had an operating fleet of 471 (2021: 422) Boeing 737s and 29 (2021: 29) 
Airbus A320 aircraft. In September 2014, the Group agreed to purchase up to 200 (100 firm and 100 options) 
Boeing 737-8200 aircraft which was subsequently increased to 210 (135 firm and 75 options). In December 
2020, the Group increased its firm orders from 135 to 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft. In the year ended 
March 31, 2022, the Group took delivery of 61 of these aircraft. The remaining aircraft are due to be 
delivered before the end of fiscal year 2025.

    8.         Analysis of operating segment
   The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the Group CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).
   The Group currently comprises four key separate airlines, Buzz, Lauda Europe (Lauda), Malta Air and 
Ryanair DAC. Ryanair DAC and Malta Air are separate reportable segments as they each exceed the applicable 
quantitative thresholds for reporting purposes. Buzz and Lauda do not individually exceed the quantitative 
thresholds and accordingly are presented on an aggregate basis as they exhibit similar economic 
characteristics and their services, activities and operations are sufficiently similar in nature. The 
results of these operations are included as 'Other Airlines.'
   The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the profit/(loss) after tax of each airline 
for the reporting period. Resource allocation decisions for all airlines are based on airline performance 
for the relevant period, with the objective in making these resource allocation decisions being to 
optimize consolidated financial results.
   Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

  Ancillary revenues comprise of revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, in-flight sales and 
Internet related services. Non-flight scheduled revenue arises from the sale of priority boarding, 
allocated seats, car hire, travel insurance, room reservations and other sources, including excess baggage 
charges and other fees, all directly attributable to the low-fares business.
   The vast majority of ancillary revenue is recognised at a point in time, which is typically the flight 
date. The economic factors that would impact the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and 
cashflows associated with the provision of passenger travel related ancillary services are homogeneous 
across the various component categories within ancillary revenue. Accordingly, there is no further 
disaggregation of ancillary revenue required in accordance with IFRS 15, paragraph 114.

Body
   Except as stated otherwise below, this year's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
   New IFRS standards and amendments adopted during the year
   The following new and amended IFRS standards, amendments and IFRIC interpretations, have been issued by 
the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the 
Group's financial year beginning on April 1, 2021 and therefore have been applied by the Group in these 
condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements:
   --     Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts - Deferral of IFRS 9 (effective on or after January 1, 
2021).
   --     Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase

   --     Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases - Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions Beyond June 30, 2021 (effective 
on or after April 1, 2021).
   The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on the Group's financial 
position or results in the year ended March 31, 2022.
   New IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
   The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for the purposes 
of the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable.  While under review, we do not 
anticipate that the adoption of the other new or revised standards and interpretations will have a 
material impact on our financial position or results from operations:
   --     Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations; IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment; IAS 37 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets; and Annual Improvements 2018-2020
   --     Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a

   *These standards or amendments to standards are not as of yet EU endorsed.
    2.         Judgements and estimates
   The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
   In preparing these condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements, the significant judgements 
and key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the most recent published 
consolidated financial statements.
   Derivative financial instruments
   The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, 
including the risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates. Ryanair uses 
forward contracts for the purchase of its jet fuel (jet kerosene) and carbon credit (Emission Trading 
Scheme) requirements to reduce its exposure to commodity price risk. It also uses foreign currency forward 
contracts to reduce its exposure to risks related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar 
exposure associated with the purchase of new Boeing 737 aircraft and the U.S. dollar exposure associated 
with the purchase of jet fuel.
   The Group's derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and recognised as either assets 
or liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet. All derivatives, with the exception of jet fuel call 
options, are designated as cash flow hedges with the resulting gains or losses taken to other reserves. 
Jet fuel call options are measured at fair value with the resulting gains or losses taken to the income 
statement. At March 31, 2022, a net asset of EUR1.20BN (2021: net liability EUR46M) was recognised on 
balance sheet in respect of the Group's jet fuel forward contracts, foreign currency derivative 
instruments associated with future jet fuel purchases and carbon credits and a net asset of EUR330M (2021: 
net asset EUR171M) was recognised in respect of its foreign currency derivative instruments associated 
with future aircraft purchases.
   In determining the hedge effectiveness of derivative instruments used to hedge Ryanair's fuel 
requirements, there is significant judgement involved in assessing whether the volumes of jet fuel hedged 
are still expected to be highly probable forecast transactions. Specifically, significant judgement is 
required in respect of the assumptions related to the expected recovery of passenger demand and the 
subsequent flight schedules following the Covid-19 pandemic along with the potential for travel 
restrictions to be reimposed. All of these assumptions impact upon forecast fuel consumption, and minor 
changes to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
   In respect of foreign currency hedge effectiveness for future aircraft purchases, there is a high 
degree of judgement involved in assessing whether the future aircraft payments are still considered highly 
probable of occurring, and the timing of these future payments for aircraft. The timing of future payments 
for aircraft is dependent on the aircraft manufacturer's ability to meet forecast aircraft delivery 
schedules.
   As at March 31, 2022 the Group had entered into jet fuel forward contracts covering approximately 65% 
of its estimated requirements for fiscal year 2023 and approximately 5% of its estimated requirements for 
fiscal year 2024. The Group believes these hedges to be effective for hedge accounting purposes.
   Long-lived assets - Useful lives, residual values and impairment
   At March 31, 2022, the Group had EUR9.10BN of property, plant and equipment long-lived assets, of which 
EUR8.93BN were aircraft. In accounting for long-lived assets, the Group must make estimates about the 
expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, the cost of major 
airframe and engine overhaul.
   In determining the useful lives and expected residual values of the aircraft, and the cost of major 
airframe and engine overhaul, the Group has based the estimates on a range of factors and assumptions, 
including its own historic experience and past practices of aircraft disposal and renewal programmes, 
forecasted growth plans, external valuations from independent appraisers, recommendations from the 
aircraft supplier and manufacturer and other industry available information.
   The Group's estimate of each aircraft's residual value is 15% of the current market value of new 
aircraft, and each aircraft's useful life is determined to be 23 years. For the 61 new Boeing 737-8200 
aircraft delivered during the year ended March 31, 2022, the Group has determined the estimated useful 
life to be 23 years and estimated residual value to be 15% of its current market value upon delivery. An 
element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed on acquisition to its service potential, 
reflecting the maintenance condition of its engines and airframe. This cost, which can equate to a 
substantial element of the total aircraft cost, is amortised over the shorter of the period to the next 
maintenance check (usually between 8 and 12 years) or the remaining life of the aircraft.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -5-
   Revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to maintenance programmes, changes in 
utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on ageing aircraft, changes in new aircraft 
technology, changes in governmental and environmental taxes, changes in new aircraft fuel efficiency and 
changing market prices for new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. The Group therefore 
evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each reporting period, and, when warranted, adjusts these 
assumptions. Any adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.
   The Group evaluates, at the end of each reporting period, whether there is any indication that its 
long-lived assets may be impaired. Factors that may indicate potential impairment include, but are not 
limited to, significant decrease in the market value of an aircraft based on observable information, a 
significant change in an aircraft's physical condition and operating or cash flow losses associated with 
the use of the aircraft.
    3.         Seasonality of operations
   The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly,

  *The fair value of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values due to the short-term

   The Group issued senior, unsecured bonds for EUR1.2BN in May 2021. The bond has a coupon of 0.875% and 
a maturity date of May 2026. During the year ended March 31, 2022 the Group repaid the maturing EUR850M 
(2014) Eurobond issued at a coupon of 1.875% and repaid the GBP600M HMT and Bank of England CCFF in full.
   During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Group issued promissory notes to the value of EUR226M with 
maturity dates of October 2022. The notes were issued in settlement of certain aircraft trade payables and 
are non-interest bearing. The carrying value of the promissory notes is not considered to be materially 
different from its fair value.
    13.       Shareholders' equity and shareholders' returns
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -8-
   During the year ended March 31, 2022 6.5M ordinary shares were issued at a strike price between EUR6.25 
and EUR12.00 per share following the exercise of vested options for total proceeds of EUR47M. There were 
no shareholder returns during the year ended March 31, 2022.
    14.       Going concern
   The Directors, having made inquiries, including consideration of the possible future financial effects 
associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for at least the next 12 months and that it is appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing these condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements. While there is 
uncertainty as to the full extent of the impact on the Ryanair Group, the continued preparation of the 
Group's condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements on the going concern basis is supported by 
the financial projections prepared by the Group.
   In arriving at this decision to adopt the going concern basis of accounting, the Board has considered, 
among other things:
   --     The Group's liquidity with EUR3.63BN cash at March 31, 2022, a EUR0.83BN reduction in net debt 
when compared to March 31, 2021 (despite EUR1.18BN capital expenditure) and the Group's continued focus on 
cash management;
   --     The Group's solid BBB credit ratings combined with a stable outlook (from both S&P and Fitch 
Ratings);
    --     The Group's strong balance sheet position with over 90% of its B737 fleet unencumbered;
   --     The Group's access to the debt capital markets. In May 2021, the Group raised a EUR1.2BN, 5-year 
unsecured, Eurobond at a coupon of 0.875%;
   --     Ongoing cost reductions across the Group, coupled with the Group's ability (as evidenced 
throughout the Covid-19 crisis) to preserve cash and reduce operational and capital expenditure in a 
downturn;
    --     The widespread rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine and booster programme in Europe;
    --     Increased bookings and passenger traffic; and
   --     The Group's flexibility to react quickly to improved customer demand following vaccine rollouts 
and the launch of EU Digital Covid Certificates in 2021.

   There were no significant post balance sheet events.

   During the year ended March 31, 2022, net capital additions amounted to EUR1.5BN principally reflecting 
61 aircraft deliveries, aircraft pre-delivery deposits and capitalised maintenance offset by supplier 
reimbursements of EUR114M. In the year ended March 31, 2022 the Group sold 10 Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.
    10.       Government grants and assistance
   In April 2020, the Group raised GBP600M unsecured debt for general corporate purposes under the HMT and 
Bank of England CCFF. The 0.44% interest rate was the prevailing rate for strong BBB rated companies. This 
debt was extended in March 2021 for a further 12 months at a 0.46% interest rate. In October 2021 the 
Group repaid the GBP600M HMT and Bank of England CCFF in full.
   During the year ended March 31, 2022, some European countries in which the Ryanair Group operates 
continued to make available payroll support schemes. The Ryanair Group utilised a number of these 
employment retention schemes to protect jobs within the Group. These schemes were a mix of short term 
Covid-19 specific programmes and long-term schemes linked to social security that existed pre Covid-19. 
The total amount of payroll supports received by the Group under the various schemes amounted to 
approximately EUR82M (2021: EUR84M) and are offset against staff costs in the condensed consolidated 
preliminary income statement. Such supports wound down significantly in H2 FY22.
   There are no unfulfilled conditions attaching to government assistance at March 31, 2022.
    11.       Related party transactions
   The Company's related parties comprise its subsidiaries, Directors and key management personnel. All 
transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
   There were no related party transactions in the year ended March 31, 2022 that materially affected the 
financial position or the performance of the Group during that period and there were no changes in the 
related party transactions described in the 2021 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the 
financial position or performance of the Group in the same period.
    12.       Financial instruments and financial risk management
   The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
   These condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk 
management information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in 
conjunction with the 2021 Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the 
year. While there have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year, the Group has started

using jet fuel call options to manage some of the risk associated with rising fuel prices. These options 
set a maximum price that the Group will pay for jet fuel.
   Fair value hierarchy
   Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
   --     Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
the Group can access at the measurement date.
   --     Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    --     Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
   Fair value estimation
   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
   Financial instruments measured at fair value
   --    Derivatives - interest rate swaps : Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine 
their fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. The Group's credit risk and 
counterparty's credit risk is taken into account when establishing fair value (Level 2).
   --    Derivatives - currency forwards, jet fuel forward contracts and carbon contracts: A comparison of 
the contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2022 
has been used to establish fair value. The Group's credit risk and counterparty's credit risk is taken 
into account when establishing fair value (Level 2).
   --    Derivatives - jet fuel call options: The fair value of jet fuel call options is determined based 
on market accepted valuation techniques, primarily Black-Scholes modelling (Level 2).
   The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the year ended March 31, 2022, there 
were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
   Financial instruments not measured at fair value
   --    Long-term debt : The repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at the 
relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at March 31, 2022 to arrive at a 
fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
   While there have been improvements in business and economic circumstances during fiscal year 2022, the 
future outlook for the business is such that there has been no material change to the fair values of 
financial assets and financial liabilities.
   The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated preliminary balance sheet, are as follows:

  STATEMENT FROM THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER
   Dear Shareholder,
   Last year was one of gratification postponed for us, as the pandemic carried on and lockdown restrictions further 
damaged a number of the businesses in the portfolio, which itself remains well positioned for the end of restrictions 
and a resumption of normal economic life. This was particularly acute for our airline holdings.
   The pandemic has proved to be another pullback from which our portfolio recovered its value and set out a new 
high (NAV wise); this one took 476 calendar days. In the 24 years that Phoenix has been managing money we have 
experienced 6 significant pullbacks of 24% and more. In all prior occasions, the reversal from old peak to new peak 
has always been within a year, but this is the first to go over that timescale, albeit by a small number of months. We 
believe starting out with a portfolio of very undervalued businesses and using the fall in prices to act rationally, 
combined with an absence of leverage is why this happens.
   Apart from the preservation of capital, what matters is the amount of future value we add by acting rationally in 
those dips to acquire investments whose valuations have overreacted to the negative short term news.
   In the market drop of 2020 we did add considerable value to intrinsic value but that had to be set against the loss 
in intrinsic value suffered by a number of our businesses from the forced closures and restrictions on economic 
activity. Considerable value was lost in airlines and hospitality. Putting it together we emerged with more value than 
we entered with but not with as significant a boost as we would have liked and have achieved in most other major 
pullbacks.
   At the beginning of 2021 we outlined our plan to buy an inexpensive hedge against the risk that the pandemic 
response would unleash inflation. The hedge was purchased in July/August once conditions permitted. That 
inflation risk did subsequently manifest itself and the hedge significantly increased in value. This added 
considerably to the Company performance and value during 2021. We spent 1% of the Company net assets on the 
hedge and ultimately sold it for around 17 times that. Those proceeds now sit in the Company as cash and UK 
Treasury Bills, which we will deploy into opportunities that meet our criteria, which is with a minimum of 100% of 
upside to their intrinsic values. If we do that, we will have turned 1% into at least 34% which should more than 
compensate for any damage to the overall value of our businesses from the higher rates that inflation brings.
   We don't hedge often (twice in 24 years). We only hedge when the following conditions apply; there is a risk that 
we believe is improbable but could damage the intrinsic value of our portfolio materially and there is insurance 
available in some form that is very cheap so that we can spend a very modest amount of the portfolio (1% or less) 
to hedge against it. We don't hedge to smooth out expected swings in the market - that's not our definition of risk. 
We will never take open ended liability, and the most that could have been lost on this investment was 1%. We will 
never imperil your capital.
   As we write the world is entering another period of bad news politically and economically with the tragedy 
unfolding in Ukraine. This creates even more complications for central banks trying to work out what to do with 
interest rates. Inflation is being pushed higher by the impact on energy prices but this is the sort of inflation that 
ends up in recession as spending is diverted away from other things to cover higher energy prices. Based upon 
what we can see at this point there is less fundamental damage to the intrinsic value of the portfolio than that 
caused by the pandemic lockdowns. Furthermore, we enter into this turbulent period with 19% of the Company's 
total assets in cash and cash equivalents and, as always, a roster of businesses we would like to own should they 
become available at attractive prices.
   An analysis of our past record shows the majority of the value we add through portfolio changes, occur in those 
infrequent windows where markets are overwhelmed with pessimism. Although as an investor it is never

comfortable watching an investment fall in value, please take some comfort that it is in those times we plant the 
seeds of future growth in your capital.

   --     In June 2021, the Group announced it was building its enterprise-focused Metaverse offering, 
with the launch expected in the second half of 2022
   Medium-Term Outlook:
    --     The Group is on track to deliver its ambitious medium-term financial objectives:
   o  Annual ENGAGE revenue growth in excess of 100% until EUR10 million target achieved by 2025
   o  Gross margin to reach a level in excess of 80% once ENGAGE revenue is between EUR5 million and EUR10 
million annually
   o  10% average month on month increase to reach 100,000 monthly users, reflecting a target of 500 
active customers
   o  Customer Retention Rate of at least 80%
   o  Growth in average annual contract value to EUR20,000+, reflecting the targeted Enterprise and 
Institutional client base and ENGAGE value proposition
   David Whelan, CEO, ENGAGE XR, said:  "2021 was a pivotal year of growth for our business with an 
impressive revenue increase of 68% thanks to the growth in demand for ENGAGE. During the year, we 
continued to expand ENGAGE's client list of blue-chip companies, and the platform reached a record 139 
commercial customers.
   "We believe that one area that makes ENGAGE stand out compared to its competition is data security. 
Therefore, we are very proud to have become the only multi-user VR platform to have ISO 27001

   "The really exciting growth opportunity for our business is providing Metaverse services, via ENGAGE, 
to major enterprise clients. Our Metaverse plans for ENGAGE are very different to Meta's Horizons, 
Microsoft's AltSpace or Roblox. We are well positioned to become the enterprise solution for companies 
seeking to enter the Metaverse to host meetings, events, product launches, and conduct training. We are 
already capturing this opportunity through our work with 3M, who is using our platform to build its own 
'Metaworld'. We look forward to fully launching our metaverse offering in the second half of this year.
   "At ENGAGE XR we are expanding fast, and I expect 2022 to far eclipse the achievements of previous 
years."

Engage XR Holdings PLC Final Results
  The Directors of the Company take responsibility for this announcement. This announcement contains inside 
information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation.
   CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW
   Overview
   2021 has been a busy year with many changes to our organisation. One of the biggest changes was the 
rebranding of the Group to ENGAGE XR from VR Education Holdings Plc as we moved away from building one-off 
education-based products to a much broader immersive platform under the brand, ENGAGE.
   Although these education-based products were profitable, the real growth opportunity is providing Metaverse 
services via ENGAGE to major enterprise clients. During the year, we have added great names to our client list, 
including BMW, 3M, Abbott, Unilever, and Facebook (now META) to name just a few. We also work with globally 
recognised international accountancy and professional services firms, and each month, we have seen our client 
base grow.
   ENGAGE
   We have seen a marked increase in demand for ENGAGE services, with more than 60% of our revenue coming 
through enterprise clients. To better target enterprise clients, we have completely rebranded our website 
(www.engagevr.io) to showcase our offer to them. Furthermore, our marketing and business development teams 
have been refocused on this area. To support them, we have hired a Director of Revenue, Richard Allin, and a new 
Head of Marketing, Kyle Horner, who will start before the end of March 2022.
   For enterprise customers, security is paramount. One area we believe that makes ENGAGE stand out compared 
to its competition is its data security and hosting abilities. For enterprise clients to adopt metaverse services, they 
require extensive security clearance to know exactly how their data is handled and where it is stored. In October 
2021, ENGAGE was granted ISO 27001 certification and as of today, ENGAGE is the only multi-user VR platform 
to have ISO 27001 certification. This certification makes it much easier for blue-chip companies to work with us, and 
move their employees and clients away from traditional video-based communications into the immersive spatial 
environments ENGAGE provides.
   Expansion
   In mid-2021, we closed a placing of EUR8.5 million (net of expenses) to help scale the business due to increased 
client demand. Our team has grown to serve our expanding client base, with many new hires in our after-sales and 
virtual event support teams. Our newly appointed Director of Revenue will have a sizable budget to build our sales, 
lead generation and client onboarding teams. The primary focus will be the US, and secondly, Asia.
   To support our sales efforts in the US, we have engaged 5W Public Relations ("5WPR"), one of the larger US PR 
companies. With guidance from our new Non-Executive Director, Kenny Jacobs (former Chief Marketing Officer of 
Ryanair), and a new US-based Director of Marketing, 5WPR will be tasked with making ENGAGE a widely 
recognised brand name in the US before the year-end. The 5WPR contract starts in March 2022, and we expect to 
see significant growth in our brand awareness in the following months.
   The Metaverse
   With Facebook changing its name to Meta, and Mark Zuckerberg outlining his Metaverse vision, there has been 
increased interest in what we have been building. In terms of the Metaverse, our plans for ENGAGE are very 
different to Meta's Horizons, Microsoft's AltSpace or Roblox. All of these platforms are focused on massive user 
growth, with the majority being aimed at a young demographic to socialise and play games. Therefore, 
entertainment companies will engage with these platforms to increase brand awareness.  However, enterprise 
clients seeking a metaverse solution to enable real business dealings and host professional virtual events will 
choose ENGAGE.

    --    5-year growth accelerates to 225m guests p.a. by FY26 (prev. 200m p.a.).
   Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, said:
   ENVIRONMENT:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
   "Every passenger who switches to Ryanair from legacy airlines cuts their CO emissions by up to 50% per 
flight. Over the next 5-years our traffic will grow by 50% to 225m p.a.  This growth will be delivered on 
a fleet of new B737 "Gamechanger" aircraft, which offer 4% more seats, but burn 16% less fuel and reduce 
noise emissions by 40%.
   Our work with the EU, fuel suppliers, and aircraft manufacturers to accelerate sustainable aviation 
fuel (SAF) supply continues, in partnership with Trinity College Dublin.  Ryanair hopes to power 12.5% of 
our flights using SAF by 2030.  Ryanair aims to cut CO per passenger/km by 10% to less than 60 grams by 
2030.  We are working with A4E and the EU Commission to accelerate reform of the Single European Sky, to 
minimise ATC inefficiency and delays which will significantly lower fuel consumption, CO emissions and 
flight delays.
   In Q3 Ryanair published our "Aviation with Purpose" sustainability report highlighting ambitious 
environmental and social targets over the coming years and mapping out Ryanair's path to net carbon zero 
by 2050.  Our environmental strategy, and progress to date, enabled CDP to upgrade Ryanair's climate 
protection rating to B from B- in Dec. 2021.  This is a significant advance towards our goal of an 
independent climate "A" rating within the next 2 years.
   SOCIAL:
   Our 5-year growth plan will create over 6,000 new well paid jobs for highly trained pilots, cabin crew 
and engineers all over Europe.  Last Oct. Ryanair invested EUR50m in a cutting-edge Aviation Skills 
Training Centre in Dublin and we plan to invest over EUR100m in 2 more, high skills, training centres (one 
possibly in Spain/Portugal and one in CEE) during this period.  To facilitate this growth, Ryanair 
recently ordered up to 8 CAE full flight simulators (at a value of over $80m).  The first of these new 
sims delivers in FY23.
   Following the success of our first Customer Panel meeting in Sept., the Panel will meet again in Madrid 
in the Spring.   We have implemented many of these customer suggestions, including a Day of Travel service 
in the Ryanair App to assist customers with live updates through every step of their Ryanair journey, a 
new Ryanair wallet for speedy refunds and an online self-service hub.  Our unbending commitment to 
delivering our customers the lowest fares, the most on-time flights, an industry lowest CO emissions and 
friendly customer service has seen Ryanair record its highest ever customer satisfaction ("CSAT") score of 
89% in Q3.  Our on-time performance in the 3(rd) quarter, including the busy Christmas/ New Year period, 
was excellent with almost 90% of all Ryanair flights arriving in "on-time".
   COVID-19 - RECOVERY:
   We delivered a strong traffic rebound in Q2 (Sept. quarter) following the successful rollout of the EU 
Digital Covid Certificates ("DCC") in July, and the relaxation of EU travel restrictions. Q3 got off to a 
good start with strong bookings for the Oct. mid-term break, and less confusion (in Oct.) about the UK 
Govt.'s absurd 'traffic light' system.  Ryanair's load active/yield passive recovery strategy saw Oct. 
traffic rise to 11.3m (84% load factor).  Our Nov. load factor improved to 86% (10.2m guests), albeit at 
lower fares.  The sudden emergence of the Omicron variant (late Nov.), and the media hysteria it generated 
in Dec., forced many European Govts. to reimpose travel restrictions in the run-up to Christmas, which 
significantly weakened peak (close-in) Christmas & New Year bookings and fares.  As a result, Dec. traffic 
slowed to just 9.5m (with a lower 81% load factor), well behind the expected target of 11m guests.  Jan. 
capacity was cut by 33% on 22 Dec. which lowered the Jan. traffic target from 10m to between 6m-7m 
customers.  We hope that the rollout of booster vaccines across Europe in recent weeks, and growing 
evidence that Omicron is less virulent than other variants, will enable EU Govts. to remove travel 
restrictions and restore consumer confidence in inter EU air travel well in advance of Easter and peak 
S.22.
   The Covid-19 crisis accelerated the collapse of many European airlines including Flybe, Norwegian, 
Germanwings, Level, Stobart and led to material capacity cuts at many others including Alitalia, TAP, LOT, 
SAS, etc.  The tsunami of State Aid from EU Govts. to their insolvent flag carriers (Alitalia, Air 
France/KLM, Iberia, LOT, Lufthansa, SAS, TAP and others) will distort EU competition and prop up high 
cost, inefficient, flag carriers for some years.  Ryanair was one of very few airlines during the Covid 
crisis to place significant new aircraft orders, to expand our airport partnerships and to secure lower 
operating costs so that we can pass on even lower fares on many new routes during the post Covid recovery.  
Together with our airport partners, we are leading Europe's traffic recovery and we plan to deliver 
accelerated traffic growth and jobs over the next 5 years.
   GROWTH:
   Over the past 9 months our Route Development team continued to work with like-minded airport partners 
to negotiate lower airport costs, recovery incentives and growth deals.  In addition to 15 new bases 
(Agadir, Billund, Chania, Corfu, Cork, Madeira, Newcastle, Nuremberg, Riga, Stockholm, Venice (Marco-
Polo), Venice (Treviso), Turin, Zadar & Zagreb), 720 new routes were announced and low-cost long term 
growth deals were extended in Stansted (to 2028), Bergamo (2028), Manchester (2028), East Midlands (2028) 
and Charleroi (2030). Our Group has doubled its capacity in Rome (FCO), Lisbon, Vienna and we will base a 
record 33 aircraft in Dublin for S.22.  Regrettably, our 5 aircraft base at Frankfurt Main will close in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
Mar. as Frankfurt's price increases rendered it unable to compete with the many low cost airports across 
Europe and Germany (Nuremberg) seeking to accelerate traffic recovery and growth.
   Up to the end of Q3, Ryanair has taken delivery of 41 B737-8200 "Gamechanger" aircraft and we hope to 
have over 65 new aircraft in our fleet for peak S.22 when our capacity will be approx. 114% of S.19 (pre-
Covid) levels. These Gamechangers widen the cost gap between Ryanair and all other European airlines for 
the next decade. Their operational reliability, fuel consumption and CO emissions have so far exceeded 
guidelines, with universally positive passenger and crew feedback.  Based on our 210 order book and 
available fleet capacity, the Ryanair Group plan to accelerate traffic growth over the next 5 years.  From 
a pre-Covid annual traffic of 149m, we now expect to grow by 50% to over 225m guests p.a. by FY26 
(previously 33% growth to 200m p.a.).
   Q3 FY22 BUSINESS REVIEW:
   Revenue & Costs
   Q3 scheduled revenues increased 345% to EUR0.79bn as traffic recovered strongly from 8.1m to 31.1m 
guests (at an 84% load factor). Despite a strong start to Q3, especially the school's mid-term break in 
Oct., the Omicron variant, and return of travel restrictions in early Dec., significantly damaged (higher 
yielding) close-in Christmas & New Year bookings.  Ave. fares in Q3 were just EUR25 (down 24% on the same 
quarter pre Covid). Ancillary revenue delivered a solid performance, generating EUR22 per passenger (+8%), 
as guests choose priority boarding and reserved seating.  Total revenues increased by over 330% to 
EUR1.47bn in Q3.
   While sectors more than doubled (+220%) and traffic rose 286%, operating costs increased by just 136% 
to EUR1.59bn, driven primarily by lower variable costs such as airport & handling, route charges and 
improved fuel burn as more Gamechangers enter the fleet (offset by the higher cost of jet fuel).  Lower 
costs, coupled with rising load factors, saw unit cost per passenger in Q3 (ex-fuel) reduce to EUR32, an 
excellent performance.
   Our fuel requirements are almost fully hedged for Q4 FY22 (over 60% jet swaps at $580 per metric tonne, 
with caps hedging the balance at $750).  H1 FY23 is 80% hedged (60% jet swaps at $620 and 20% caps at 
$715) and H2 FY23 is 70% hedged at $640.  Carbon credits are fully hedged for FY22 and 80% hedged for FY23 
at EUR24 and EUR45 per EUA respectively (well below the current spot price of c.EUR85).  Ryanair's very 
strong and sensible hedging policy will deliver significant savings for all our customers and shareholders 
at a time when many airline competitors have unwisely reduced or abandoned sensible hedging strategies.

Body
   Ryanair's balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry with a BBB (stable) credit rating (S&P 
and Fitch), almost EUR3bn cash (at 31 Dec.) and 90% of our B737 fleet unencumbered. In Oct. the Group 
repaid its UK CCFF GBP600m loan 5 months early.  During the Covid crisis, net debt has risen to over 
EUR2bn.  We plan to reduce this net debt to zero as quickly as possible over the next 2 years.  Strong 
operating cashflows, offset by EUR0.8bn capex (mainly Gamechanger deliveries and aircraft deposits), drove 
a slight reduction in net debt to EUR2.1bn at 31 Dec. (31 Mar.: EUR2.3bn).    The strength of Ryanair's 
balance sheet ensures that the Group is well poised to capitalise rapidly on the many growth opportunities 
that exist in Europe into the post Covid-19 recovery in 2022 and 2023.
   OUTLOOK:
   The outlook for pricing and yields for the remainder of FY22 is hugely uncertain.  As announced on 22 
Dec., our Jan. capacity was cut by 33% (reducing traffic from approx. 10m to between 6m-7m). While recent 
bookings have improved, following easing of travel restrictions, the booking curve remains very late and 
close-in, so Q4 traffic requires significant price stimulation at lower prices to quickly recover load 
factors which suffered steep declines due to the Omicron collapse in bookings over the Christmas/New Year 
period.  Ryanair's full year traffic forecast remains unchanged at 'just under' 100m passengers, but due 
to Covid uncertainty the FY22 net loss guidance remains within a wider than normal range of EUR250m to 
EUR450m.  This outturn is hugely sensitive to any further positive or negative Covid news flow and so we 
would caution all shareholders to expect further Covid disruptions before we here in Europe and the rest 
of the world can finally declare that the Covid crisis is behind us."

Body
   The Group evaluates, at the end of each reporting period, whether there is any indication that its 
long-lived assets may be impaired. Factors that may indicate potential impairment include, but are not 
limited to, significant decrease in the market value of an aircraft based on observable information, a 
significant change in an aircraft's physical condition and operating or cash flow losses associated with 
the use of the aircraft.
    3.            Seasonality of operations
   The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
    4.            Income tax expense
   The Group's consolidated tax credit for the nine-months ended December 31, 2021 of EUR89.3M (December 
31, 2020: EUR63.5M) comprises a current tax credit of EUR2.1M and a deferred tax credit of EUR87.2M 
primarily relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment and net operating 
losses. This consolidated tax credit is the aggregation of separate tax charges and tax credits on the 
profits earned and losses suffered by each of the Group's operating companies calculated in accordance 
with differing tax rules and rates applicable in each jurisdiction where the Group operates. No 
significant or unusual tax charges or credits arose during the period. The effective tax rate of 
approximately 39% for the nine-months ended December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: approximately 8%) is the 
result of the mix of profits and losses incurred by Ryanair's operating subsidiaries primarily in Ireland, 
Malta, Poland and the UK.
    5.            Share based payments
   The terms and conditions of the Group's share-based remuneration programmes are disclosed in the most 
recent, published, consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR7.7M in the nine months ended 
December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: EUR3.1M) is the fair value of options granted in prior periods and a 
conditional share grant under LTIP 2019, in the current period, to over 80 managers across the Group (the 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors were not included in this LTIP grant). The charge is recognised 
within the income statement in accordance with employee services rendered. During the nine-months ended 
December 31, 2021, 5.0M ordinary shares were issued at strike prices between EUR6.25 and EUR12.00 per 
share following the exercise of vested share options.
    6.            Contingencies
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -7-
   The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
    7.            Capital commitments
   At December 31, 2021 the Group had an operating fleet of 455 (2020: 428) Boeing 737s and 29 (2020: 29) 
Airbus A320 aircraft. In September 2014, the Group agreed to purchase up to 200 (100 firm and 100 options) 
Boeing 737-8200 aircraft which was subsequently increased to 210 (135 firm and 75 options). In December 
2020, the Group increased its firm orders from 135 to 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft. In the nine-months 
ended December 31, 2021, the Group took delivery of 41 of these aircraft and expects to have over 65 
Boeing 737-8200s in the Group fleet ahead of peak Summer 2022. The remaining aircraft are due to be 
delivered before the end of fiscal year 2025.
    8.            Analysis of operating segment
   The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the Group CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).
   The Group currently comprises four key separate airlines, Buzz, Lauda, Malta Air and Ryanair DAC. 
Ryanair DAC and Malta Air are separate reportable segments as they each exceed the applicable quantitative 
thresholds for reporting purposes. Buzz and Lauda do not individually exceed the quantitative thresholds 
and accordingly are presented on an aggregate basis as they exhibit similar economic characteristics and 
their services, activities and operations are sufficiently similar in nature. The results of these 
operations are included as 'Other Airlines.'
   The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the profit/(loss) after tax of each airline 
for the reporting period. Resource allocation decisions for all airlines are based on airline performance 
for the relevant period, with the objective in making these resource allocation decisions being to 
optimize consolidated financial results.
   Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

   Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 21% to EUR68.6M due to higher aircraft utilisation.
   Other expense:
   Net finance expenses increased by EUR11.6M to EUR24.0M due to higher negative interest rates on euro 
deposits. The impact of negative deposit interest rates was managed by reducing the duration of term 
deposits.
   MD&A Nine Months Ended December 31, 2021
   Introduction
   The Ryanair Group's fleet was effectively grounded due to European Governments travel restrictions/ 
lockdowns for much of the prior period comparative (nine months ended December 31, 2020).  Sectors (up 
137%) and traffic (+179%) are therefore significantly higher in the nine months ended December 31, 2021 
(although still below pre Covid-19 levels) and the following discussion should be read in that context.
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues increased by 113% to EUR2,061.4M due to a 179% increase in traffic, from 25.2M to 
70.2M. While traffic increased significantly, the delayed relaxation of Government travel restrictions 
across Europe until July 2021 (and the reintroduction of restrictions in December due to the Omicron 
variant) meant that fares required significant price stimulation, with average fares down 24% at just 
EUR29.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues increased to EUR1,563.4M due to a 179% rebound in traffic and a solid performance in 
priority boarding and reserved seating.
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues increased by 139% to EUR3,624.8M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil increased by EUR 814.6M (+164%) to EUR1,310.0M due to a 137% increase in sectors flown and 
higher jet fuel prices offset by fuel burn savings on the new B737-8200s.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges rose by EUR333.4M (+131%) to EUR587.5M below the 137% increase in sectors 
and a 179% increase in traffic.
   Depreciation:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
   Depreciation increased by 21% to EUR529.8M, primarily due to higher amortisation resulting from 
increased aircraft utilisation and the delivery of 41 new B737-8200 aircraft in the period.
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs increased by 36% to EUR496.1M due to higher sectors.
   Route charges:
   Route charges increased by 134% to EUR399.7M, broadly in line with higher sectors.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other rose by 79% to EUR282.3M due to higher activity in the period, offset 
by cost savings.
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 34% to EUR186.4M due to higher aircraft utilisation and 
the handback of leased aircraft in the period.
   Other expense:
   Net finance expenses increased by EUR40.9M to EUR68.7M due to higher average gross debt in the period 
and negative interest rates on euro deposits. The impact of negative deposit interest rates was managed by 
reducing the duration of term deposits.
   Balance sheet:
   Gross cash decreased by EUR0.17BN to EUR2.98BN at December 31, 2021.
   Gross debt fell by EUR0.30BN to EUR5.12BN primarily due to EUR1.68BN debt repayments offset by a 
EUR1.2BN bond issuance in May 2021.
   Net debt was EUR2.14BN at December 31, 2021, down from EUR2.28BN at March 31, 2021.
   Increased activity in the nine month period (including a 137% increase in sectors and 179% rise in 
traffic), and higher forward bookings (unearned revenue) led to significant movements in Other Assets 
(+EUR0.16BN), Trade Payables (+EUR0.39BN), and Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities (+EUR0.51BN).
   Shareholders' equity:
   Shareholders' equity increased by EUR0.28BN to EUR4.93BN in the period primarily due to an IFRS hedge 
accounting unrealised gain for derivatives of EUR0.38BN, offset by the EUR0.14BN net loss.

   Interim Management Report
   Introduction
   This financial report for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 meets the reporting requirements 
pursuant to the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and Transparency Rules of the 
Central Bank of Ireland.
   This interim management report includes the following:
   -- Principal risks and uncertainties relating to the remaining three months of the year;
   -- Related party transactions; and
   -- Post balance sheet events.
   Results of operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the nine months ended 
December 31, 2020, including important events that occurred during the nine months, are set forth above in 
the MD&A.
   Principal risks and uncertainties for the remainder of the year
   The full extent of the ongoing impact of Covid-19 on the Group's longer-term operational and financial 
performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of the Group's control, 
including the duration and spread of Covid-19 and related travel advisories and restrictions, the impact 
of Covid-19 on overall long-term demand for air travel, the impact of Covid-19 on the financial health and 
operations of the Group's business partners (particularly Boeing), and future governmental actions, all of 
which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
   Among other factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected 
results for the remainder of the year are the airline pricing environment, capacity growth in Europe, fuel 
costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the replacement of aircraft, costs 
associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, UK, European Union 
("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, delays in the delivery of 
contracted aircraft, weather related disruptions, ATC strikes and staffing related disruptions, 
uncertainties surrounding Brexit, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport 
access and charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general 
economic environment in Ireland, the UK, and Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to 
travel, other economic, social and political factors and unforeseen security events.
   Board of Directors
   With the exception of Geoff Doherty, who joined the Board in October 2021, details of the members of 
the Group's Board of Directors are set forth on page 16 of the Group's 2021 annual report.

   Going concern
   The Directors, having made inquiries, including consideration of the possible future financial effects 
associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for at least the next 12 months and that it is appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing these interim financial statements. While there is uncertainty as to the full 
extent of the impact on the Ryanair Group, the continued preparation of the Group's consolidated interim 
financial statements on the going concern basis is supported by the financial projections prepared by the 
Group.
   In arriving at this decision to adopt the going concern basis of accounting, the Board has considered, 
among other things:
   --    The Group's liquidity with almost EUR3BN cash at December 31, 2021, a EUR0.14BN reduction in net 
debt in the first nine months (despite EUR0.8BN capital expenditure) and the Group's continued focus on 
cash management;
   --    The Group's solid BBB credit ratings combined with a stable outlook (from both S&P and Fitch 
Ratings);
   --    The Group's strong balance sheet position with approximately 90% of its B737 fleet unencumbered;
   --    The Group's access to the debt capital markets. In May 2021, the Group raised a EUR1.2BN, 5-year 
unsecured, Eurobond at a low coupon of 0.875%;
   --    The repayment of the HMT & Bank of England CCFF GBP600M loan in October means that the Group has 
no significant debt maturities until March 2023;
    --    Ongoing cost reductions across the Group;
    --    The widespread rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine and booster program in Europe;
    --    Increased bookings;
   --    The Group's flexibility to react quickly to improved customer demand following vaccine rollouts 
and the launch of EU Digital Covid Certificates; and
   --    The Group's ability, as evidenced throughout the Covid-19 crisis, to preserve cash and reduce 
operational and capital expenditure in a downturn.

  Ancillary revenues comprise of revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, in-flight sales and 
Internet related services. Non-flight scheduled revenue arises from the sale of priority boarding, 
allocated seats, car hire, travel insurance, room reservations and other sources, including excess baggage 
charges and other fees, all directly attributable to the low-fares business.
   The vast majority of ancillary revenue is recognized at a point in time, which is typically the flight 
date. The economic factors that would impact the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and 
cashflows associated with the provision of passenger travel related ancillary services are homogeneous 
across the various component categories within ancillary revenue. Accordingly, there is no further 
disaggregation of ancillary revenue required in accordance with IFRS 15, paragraph 114.
    9.            Property, plant and equipment
   Acquisitions and disposals
   During the nine-months ended December 31, 2021, net capital additions amounted to EUR987.3M principally 
reflecting aircraft pre-delivery deposits, capitalised maintenance, 41 aircraft deliveries and supplier 
reimbursements of EUR114M.
   Assets held for sale
   In the nine-months ended December 31, 2021 the Group entered into an agreement to sell 10 Boeing 737-
800NG aircraft for delivery in fiscal year 2022. 6 of these aircraft were sold in the nine-month period 
ended December 31, 2021. The remaining 4 aircraft are reflected as segment assets within the Ryanair DAC 
airline at December 31, 2021 (Note 8).
    10.          Government grants and assistance
   During the nine-months to December 31, 2021, many European countries in which the Ryanair Group 
operates continued to make available payroll support schemes. The Ryanair Group utilised a number of these 
employment retention schemes to protect jobs within the Group. These schemes were a mix of short term 
Covid-19 specific programmes and long-term schemes linked to social security that existed pre Covid-19. 
The total amount of payroll supports received by the Group under the various schemes amounted to 
approximately EUR59.9M (2020: EUR66.0M) and are offset against staff costs in the Consolidated Income 
Statement.
   In April 2020, the Group raised GBP600M unsecured debt for general corporate purposes under the HMT and 
Bank of England CCFF. The 0.44% interest rate was the prevailing rate for strong BBB rated companies. This 
debt was extended in March 2021 for a further 12 months at a 0.46% interest rate. In October 2021 the 
Group repaid the GBP600M HMT and Bank of England CCFF in full .
   There are no unfulfilled conditions attaching to government assistance at December 31, 2021.
    11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
   The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
   These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2021 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year. While there have 
been no changes in our risk management policies in the period, the Group has started using jet fuel call 
options to manage the risk associated with rising fuel prices. These options set a maximum price that the 
Group will pay for fuel.
   Fair value hierarchy
   Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
   --    Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
the Group can access at the measurement date.
   --    Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    --    Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
   Fair value estimation
   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
   Financial instruments measured at fair value
   --    Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine 
their fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. The Group's credit risk and 
counterparty's credit risk is taken into account when establishing fair value (Level 2).

Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -4-
   MD&A Quarter Ended December 31, 2021
   Introduction
   As a result of European Government's Covid-19 travel restrictions/lockdowns during the prior period comparative 
(quarter ended December 31, 2020), the Group experienced a significant reduction in traffic. In the quarter ended 
December 31, 2021 traffic increased by 286% to 31.1M. The Omicron variant, and return of travel restrictions in 
early December, significantly weakened (higher yielding) close-in Christmas and New Year bookings. The following 
discussion should be read in that context.
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues increased by 345% to EUR788.1M due to a 286% increase in traffic (from 8.1M to 31.1M) 
and a 15% increase in average fares to EUR25.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues increased to EUR681.8M due to a 286% rebound in traffic and a solid performance in priority 
boarding and reserved seating.
   Total Revenue:
   As a result of the above, total revenues increased by 331% to EUR1,469.9M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil increased by EUR444 .5M (+292%) to EUR596.9M due to a 220% increase in sectors flown and

   The December 31, 2021 figures and the December 31, 2020 comparative figures do not constitute statutory 
financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2021, together with the independent 
auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual 
General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
   The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 on January 28, 2022.
   Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
   New IFRS standards and amendments adopted during the year
   The following new and amended IFRS standards, amendments and IFRIC interpretations, have been issued by 
the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the 
Group's financial year beginning on April 1, 2021 and therefore have been applied by the Group in these 
condensed consolidated interim financial statements:
   --    Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts - Deferral of IFRS 9 (effective on or after January 1, 
2021).
   --    Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 
(effective on or after January 1, 2021).
   --    Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases - Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions Beyond June 30, 2021 (effective 
on or after April 1, 2021).
   The Group has evaluated the extent to which its cashflow hedging relationships are subject to 
uncertainty driven by IBOR reform as at December 31, 2021. The Group's hedged items and hedging 
instruments continue to be indexed to EURIBOR. These benchmark rates are quoted each day and the IBOR cash 
flows are exchanged with counterparties as usual.
   The calculation methodology of EURIBOR changed during 2020. In July 2020, the Belgian Financial 
Services and Markets Authority granted authorisation with respect to EURIBOR under the European Union 
Benchmarks regulation. This allows market participants to continue to use EURIBOR for both existing and 
new contracts and the Group expects that EURIBOR will continue to exist as a benchmark for the foreseeable 
future.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -6-
   The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on the Group's financial 
position or results from operations in the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
   New IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
   The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for the purposes 
of the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable.  While under review, we do not 
anticipate that the adoption of the other new or revised standards and interpretations will have a 
material impact on our financial position or results from operations:
    --    Annual Improvements 2018-2020 (effective on or after January 1, 2022).
   --    Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: Onerous Contracts 
- Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (effective for on or after January 1, 2022).
   --    Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (effective on or 
after January 1, 2022).
   --    Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations : Reference to the Conceptual Framework (effective on 
or after January 1, 2022).
   --    Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a 
Single Transaction (effective on or after January 1, 2023).*
   --    Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition 
of Accounting Estimates (effective on or after January 1, 2023).*
   --    Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making 
Materiality Judgments: Disclosure of Accounting policies (effective on or after January 1, 2023).*
   --    Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as 
Current or Non-current and Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current - Deferral of Effective 
Date (effective on or after January 1, 2023).*
    --    IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (effective on or after January 1, 2023).
   --    Amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance contracts: Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 - 
Comparative Information (effective on or after January 1, 2023)*
   *These standards or amendments to standards are not as of yet EU endorsed.
    2.            Judgements and estimates
   The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
   In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the most recent published 
consolidated financial statements.
   Derivative financial instruments
   The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, 
including the risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates. Ryanair uses 
forward contracts for the purchase of its jet fuel (jet kerosene) and carbon credit (Emission Trading 
Scheme) requirements to reduce its exposure to commodity price risk. It also uses foreign currency forward 
contracts to reduce its exposure to risks related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar 
exposure associated with the purchase of new Boeing 737 aircraft and the U.S. dollar exposure associated 
with the purchase of jet fuel.
   The Group recognises all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in its consolidated 
balance sheet and measures them at fair value. At December 31, 2021, a net asset of EUR299.5M (2020 net 
liability EUR263M) was recognised on balance sheet in respect of the Group's jet fuel forward contracts 
and carbon credits and a net asset of EUR275.9M (2020 net asset EUR68M) was recognised in respect of its 
foreign currency derivative instruments associated with future aircraft purchases.
   In determining the hedge effectiveness of derivative instruments used to hedge Ryanair's fuel 
requirements, there is significant judgement involved in assessing whether the volumes of jet fuel hedged 
are still expected to be highly probable forecast transactions. Specifically, significant judgement is 
required in respect of the assumptions related to the timing of the full removal of flight restrictions 
imposed by governments relating to the Covid-19 pandemic, the expected recovery of passenger demand and 
the subsequent flight schedules. All of these assumptions impact upon forecast fuel consumption, and minor 
changes to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
   In respect of foreign currency hedge effectiveness for future aircraft purchases, there is a high 
degree of judgement involved in assessing whether the future aircraft payments are still considered highly 
probable of occurring, and the timing of these future payments for aircraft. The timing of future payments 
for aircraft is dependent on the aircraft manufacturer's ability to meet forecast aircraft delivery 
schedules.
   As at December 31, 2021 the Group had entered into forward jet fuel hedging contracts covering 
approximately 60% of its estimated requirements for fiscal year 2022 and approximately 65% of its 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -6-
estimated requirements for fiscal year 2023. The Group believes these hedges to be effective for hedge 
accounting purposes.
   Long-lived assets - Useful lives, residual values and impairment
   At December 31, 2021, the Group had EUR8,749.3M of property, plant and equipment long-lived assets, of 
which EUR8,580.4M were aircraft. In accounting for long-lived assets, the Group must make estimates about 
the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, the cost of major 
airframe and engine overhaul.
   In determining the useful lives and expected residual values of the aircraft, and the cost of major 
airframe and engine overhaul, the Group has based the estimates on a range of factors and assumptions, 
including its own historic experience and past practices of aircraft disposal and renewal programmes, 
forecasted growth plans, external valuations from independent appraisers, recommendations from the 
aircraft supplier and manufacturer and other industry available information.
   The Group's estimate of each aircraft's residual value is 15% of the current market value of new 
aircraft, and each aircraft's useful life is determined to be 23 years. For the 41 new Boeing 737-8200 
aircraft delivered during the nine-months ended to December 31, 2021, the Group has determined the 
estimated useful life to be 23 years and estimated residual value to be 15% of its current market value 
upon delivery.
   Revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to maintenance programs, changes in utilization 
of the aircraft, governmental regulations on ageing aircraft, changes in new aircraft technology, changes 
in governmental and environmental taxes, changes in new aircraft fuel efficiency and changing market 
prices for new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. The Group therefore evaluates its estimates 
and assumptions in each reporting period, and, when warranted, adjusts these assumptions. Any adjustments 
are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.

   --          Derivatives - currency forwards, jet fuel swap contracts and EUA contracts: A comparison of 
the contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at December 31, 2021 
has been used to establish fair value. The Group's credit risk and counterparty's credit risk is taken 
into account when establishing fair value (Level 2).
   --          Derivatives - jet fuel options:   T he fair value of aircraft fuel options is determined 
based on market accepted valuation techniques, primarily Black-Scholes modelling (Level 2).
   The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the quarter ended December 31, 2021, 
there were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
   Financial instruments not measured at fair value
   --          Long-term debt: The repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at December 31, 2021 to arrive 
at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
   While there have been improvements in business and economic circumstances during the quarter ended 
December 31, 2021, the future outlook for the business is such that there has been no material change to 
the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities.
   The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:
                                      At Dec 31,   At Dec 31,   At Mar 31,   At Mar 31,

   22 December 2021
   RYANAIR LOWERS F.Y. GUIDANCE AS OMICRON VARIANT WEAKENS CHRISTMAS TRAFFIC.  JANUARY CAPACITY IS CUT BY 
33%.
   The Board of Ryanair Holdings plc today, (22 December) announced that it was lowering its full Year 
Guidance from a previous Net Loss range of between EUR100m to EUR200m, as the Omicron Covid variant and 
recent Government travel restrictions across Europe have notably weakened close-in Christmas & New Year 
bookings. This sudden downturn has also caused Ryanair this week to cut its planned January schedule 
capacity by 33%.
   The impact of these recent Government travel restrictions, in particular last weekend's ban on UK 
arrivals into France and Germany, and the suspension of all EU flights to/from Morocco has lowered 
Ryanair's expected December traffic from between 10m-11m, to a lower range of between 9.0m-9.5m. In 
responding to these restrictions, Ryanair has now cut its January capacity by 33%, reducing its expected 
January traffic from approx. 10m to between 6m-7m. In light of the current uncertainty about the Omicron 
variant, and intra Europe travel restrictions, no schedule cutbacks have yet been decided for February or 
March 2022. These schedules will be revisited in January as more scientific information becomes available 
on the Omicron variant, its impact on hospitalisations, European population and/or travel restrictions in 
February or March.
   As a result of these new Covid developments, it is now likely that Ryanair's full year traffic forecast 
will be just under 100m passengers (previously guided at just over 100m), and the expected Net Loss for 
the full year (end 31 March 2022) is likely to be within a new range of EUR250m to EUR450m. However, these 
figures are hugely sensitive to any further positive or negative Covid news flow. Ryanair hopes to have 
more clarity, especially on the impact of Omicron on intra Europe travel restrictions, in time for its Q3 
results on 31 January next.

  Principal risks and uncertainties
   The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the company, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. A summary of the 
nature of the risks currently faced by the Group is set out below. A more detailed explanation of the 
risks currently faced by the Group and how the Company seeks to mitigate those risks can be found in the 
risk management section of the Group's Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 September 2021.
   --    Consumer demand: A recession or reduced economic growth can lead to reduced job security and a 
reduction in consumer leisure spending.  A weak pound makes holidays more expensive. High-profile 
corporate failures reduce consumer confidence to make 'big ticket' purchases. Terrorist attacks, war/acts 
of force and civil unrest undermine consumer confidence. COVID-19 has shifted consumer behaviour with many 
people choosing not to book a holiday or delaying booking. Ryanair has sought to degrade the customer 
experience for customers of OTAs which could reduce customer demand for the Group's holidays. Climate 
change could impact demand e.g. if customers choose to travel less frequently.
   --    Flight supply: A lack of flight supply/capacity impacts the Group's ability to fulfil consumer 
demand for holidays. Where the Group does not have an agreement in place with an airline, such airline may 
not wish to accept bookings from the Group's customers and might seek to impede the Group's access to 
flight data and bookability. Certain airlines use technological and other means to prevent the Group's 
bookings or to apply a price difference to make the Group's bookings more expensive, which could make the 
Group's offering less extensive or more expensive which could have a  material adverse effect on the 
Group. The Group is one of several OTAs against which Ryanair has brought litigation in Ireland in 
connection with Ryanair's efforts to prevent OTAs from booking and selling its flights. The legal process, 
which began in 2010, is ongoing but remains at an early stage. The case lay dormant for over 3 years with 
no material developments in that period, and as a result the Group is seeking to strike out the claim on 
the basis of inordinate and inexcusable delay. Other airlines could seek to emulate Ryanair's claim 
against OTAs. Litigation is unpredictable and if Ryanair were to prevail, this could have a material 
impact on the Group's business. Ryanair's aggression towards OTAs like OTB has escalated since the start 
of the pandemic, e.g. Ryanair has sought to block bookings and degrade the customer experience for 
customers of OTAs. In order to mitigate flight supply risk, the Group may take allocations of seats on 
certain key routes, which may involve some limited risk. If the Group cannot sell the seats profitably or 
the programme is cancelled, this could lead to material costs for the Group.
   --    Supplier failure: In the event of a major airline failure, the Group must replace the customer's 
flight arrangements, or refund the customer in full for the holiday, with no ability to claim back the 
costs from the failed airline or any bond or effective insurance or the ATOL scheme/CAA (which protects 
consumers, not package organisers). Whilst the Group can usually recover flight costs it is owed via 
chargeback claims, this creates a cash flow impact.
   --   Competition risk: The Group operates in a very competitive market. If competitors offer a more 
compelling proposition, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position and 
prospects. COVID-19 has seen the rise of refund credit notes in lieu of cash refunds which could increase 
competition risk as they create captive consumers for those organisers issuing the credit notes, thereby 
potentially reducing the demand for the Group's offering. In order to provide the most competitive range 
of holiday options, and in view of the dominance by certain airlines on certain flight routes, the Group 
must have the ability to book the widest range of airlines available. If flight supply risk increases, so 
would competition risk. Our customers care about climate and ESG issues and if our competitors are 
perceived to be doing more to meet consumer needs in this area, we could be less attractive to consumers.
   --    Package organiser liability: The Group is responsible for the proper performance of the package 
holidays it sells, therefore it can be held liable for death/personal injury or illness suffered by 
customers that are the fault of any of the suppliers. In the event of a catastrophic injury/fatality, or 
multiple injuries, the cost could run into millions of pounds. The Group must also provide replacement 
travel services or a refund where a supplier cancels a holiday element, and provide accommodation where 
customers are stranded. In the current climate, less people are going on holiday which reduces personal 
injury claims. We do however anticipate claims in respect of refunds for cancelled holidays as a result of 
the disruption. Conditions in the insurance markets continue to be extremely difficult due to COVID-19 
pressures, and travel is one of the most affected industries, meaning an increase in insurance costs.
   --    Recoverability of airline refunds: The pandemic brought about a new risk in relation to the 
recoverability of refunds with some airlines not refunding flight costs in a timely manner or not 
refunding the flight costs at all because the flight still went ahead, despite restrictions on customers' 
ability to travel. During the pandemic, many airlines were not complying with legal obligations to refund 
On the Beach Group PLC Preliminary Results -15-
flight costs within 7 days of the flight being cancelled. As such the Group had to refund many customers 
in advance of getting the monies from the airlines. Since last year, most airlines have got quicker at 
refunding, albeit we are still awaiting refunds for some cancelled flights.
   --    Regulatory breach: The Group's business is highly regulated and is subject to a complex regime of 
laws, rules and regulations concerning travel and aviation, online commerce, financial services, consumer 
rights and data protection. A breach of these laws could have serious financial and reputational 
implications for the Group. Unfavourable changes to or interpretation of existing laws could adversely 
affect the Group's business and financial performance. Regulation on climate related reporting is 
developing at pace and the Group will need to ensure it takes appropriate action to ensure compliance with 
legal and regulatory obligations in this area.
   --    Damage to brand/reputation: The Group relies on the strength of its brand to attract customers to 
its website and to secure bookings. Failure to maintain and protect our brand, or any events or 
circumstances which give rise to adverse publicity (including the conduct of airlines), could cause 
brand/reputation damage, lead to a loss of goodwill and reduced customer demand to book with the Group. 
COVID-19 had impacted our reputation and during FY21, we have been focused on taking steps to repair that 
damage and reinvigorate the brand. Our customers are becoming increasingly concerned about ESG matters and 
if consumers feel that the Group is not taking enough action in this area, it could negatively affect the 
perception of our brand.
   --    IT systems and data security: The Group is exposed to security threats and the associated risk of 
breach whereby a third party could illegally gain access to our customers' or employees' personal data, 
resulting in damage to brand, material fines and litigation. The Group's growth strategy is to build 
Europe's leading beach holiday retailer via a single platform, multi-brand strategy. Our IT platforms must 
be scalable, robust and reliable. If our systems can't keep up with growing demand, this could affect our 
ability to deliver growth.

   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].

   (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be 
presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   Ryanair Holdings PLC
   19 November 2021
   NOTICE OF INTENTION TO DELIST FROM LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE
   The directors of Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") hereby give notice of their intention to request the UK 
Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") to cancel the standard listing of the Company's ordinary shares (ISIN 
IE00BYTBXV33) (the "Shares") on the Official List of the FCA, and to request the London Stock Exchange to 
cancel the admission to trading of the Shares on the main market for listed securities of the London Stock 
Exchange (together, the "Cancellation of London Listing").
   As indicated at our interim results, and following subsequent shareholder engagement, Ryanair has decided to 
request the Cancellation of London Listing as the volume of trading of the Shares on the London Stock Exchange 
does not justify the costs related to such listing and admission to trading, and so as to consolidate trading liquidity to 
one regulated market for the benefit of all shareholders.
   Pursuant to Listing Rule 5.2.8, the Company is required to give at least 20 business days' notice of the intended 
Cancellation of Listing. Therefore, it is intended that the Cancellation of London Listing will become effective from 
8.00 am (GMT) on 20 December 2021, such that the last day of trading of the Shares on the London Stock 
Exchange would be 17 December 2021.
   Following the Cancelation of the London Listing, the Company will continue to have a primary listing on the 
regulated market of Euronext Dublin, which offers shareholders the highest standard of protection, including 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, and its ADRs are listed on NASDAQ.

   Ryanair's issued share capital consisted of 1,128,792,528 Ordinary Shares of nominal value EUR0.006 each.

Length: 1669 words
Body
   Trading on the London Stock Exchange ("LSE") as a percentage of overall trading volume in Ryanair's ordinary 
shares has reduced materially during 2021. The migration away from the LSE is consistent with a general trend for 
trading in shares of EU corporates post Brexit and is, potentially, more acute for Ryanair as a result of the long-
standing prohibition on non-EU citizens purchasing Ryanair's ordinary shares being extended to UK nationals 
following Brexit.  The Board of Ryanair is now considering the merits of retaining the Standard listing on the LSE. 
Ryanair has a primary listing on the regulated market of Euronext Dublin, which offers shareholders the highest 
standard of protection, including compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, and its ADRs are listed on 
NASDAQ.
   OUTLOOK:
   The outlook for pricing and yields for the winter of FY22 will be challenging.  With the booking curve remaining 
very close-in, traffic recovery will require continuing price stimulation.  This, coupled with rising costs for the small 
unhedged balance of our fuel needs, means that visibility for the remainder of FY22 is very limited. It is therefore 
difficult to provide meaningful FY22 guidance.  We believe that FY22 traffic has improved to just over 100m and 
(subject to winter fares) expect to record an FY22 loss of between EUR100m to EUR200m.  This outturn will be 
crucially dependent on the continued rollout of vaccines and no adverse Covid-19 developments.
   ACCELERATED POST-COVID GROWTH:
   As noted above, subject to no adverse Covid developments, and high vaccination levels remaining across 
Europe, Ryanair will take delivery of 210 Gamechanger aircraft over the next 5 years which allows Ryanair uniquely 
to accelerate growth into the post Covid-19 recovery. These aircraft deliver industry lowest costs, lower emissions, 
and will enable Ryanair to exploit growth opportunities at primary and secondary airports all over Europe - 
particularly where legacy carriers have failed or cut back their fleet as a result of Covid-19 and State Aid. As 
announced at our AGM in Sept., Ryanair Group now expect to deliver accelerated growth over the next 5 years, 
with the growth forecast raised from 33% to 50%.  As a result, Ryanair's pre-Covid traffic of 149m is expected to 
grow to over 225m guests p.a. by March 2026 (previously targeted at 200m p.a.)."

  Ryanair Holdings plc, Europe's largest airline group, is the parent company of Buzz, Lauda, Malta Air & Ryanair. 
Carrying 149m guests p.a. (pre Covid-19) on more than 2,500 daily flights from over 89 bases, the Group connects 
over 230 destinations in 37 countries on a fleet of 467 aircraft, with a further 190 Boeing 737s on order, which will 
enable the Ryanair Group to lower fares and grow traffic to 225m p.a. over the next 5 years. Ryanair has a team of 
17,000 highly skilled aviation professionals delivering Europe's No.1 on-time performance, and an industry leading 
36-year safety record. Ryanair is Europe's greenest, cleanest, airline group and customers switching to fly Ryanair 
can reduce their CO emissions by up to 50% compared to the other Big 4 European major airlines.
   Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
replacement of aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, 
U.K., European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, post-Brexit 
uncertainties, weather related disruptions, ATC strikes and staffing related disruptions, delays in the delivery of 
contracted aircraft, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour 
relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK 
and Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political

  Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, said:
   OUR ENVIRONMENT:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report
   Ryanair has shown we can grow traffic while reducing our impact on the environment.  Every passenger that 
switches to Ryanair from legacy airlines reduces their CO emissions by up to 50% per flight.  Over the next 5-years 
our traffic will grow by 50% to 225m p.a.  This will be achieved on a fleet of new B737 "Gamechanger" aircraft, 
which offer 4% more seats, but consume 16% less fuel and cuts noise emissions by 40%, which helps to lower 
each passenger's CO and noise footprint over the next decade.
   We continue to work with the EU, our fuel suppliers and aircraft manufacturers to incentivise sustainable aviation 
fuel (SAF) use.  We are working with A4E and the EU Commission to accelerate reform of the Single European 
Sky, to minimise ATC delays which will lower fuel consumption and CO emissions.  Last year Ryanair received an 
industry leading "B-" climate protection rating from CDP[1], and we are committed to improving this to an "A" rating 
over the next 2 years.  In April, we established a Sustainable Aviation Research Centre partnership with Trinity 
College Dublin to accelerate the development of SAFs.  Ryanair's goal is to power 12.5% of our flights with SAF by 
2030.  These initiatives will help Ryanair achieve our target of cutting CO per passenger/km by 10% to just 60 
grams by 2030.
   Our growth plans over the next 5 years will create 5,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers.  Ryanair 
recently invested EUR50m in an Aviation Skills Training Centre in Dublin and we plan to invest over EUR100m in 2 
more, high skills, training centres in possibly Spain and Poland during this period.
   In Sept. our Customer Advisory Panel met for the first time in Dublin. This Panel will meet again in the spring and 
their advice and input will shape Ryanair's customer improvements for 2022, reinforcing our commitment to 
delivering the lowest fares, the most on-time flights and a great customer service as the Group stimulates very 
strong post Covid-19 growth. We have already implemented a number of their suggestions, including a Day of 
Travel feature in the Ryanair App to assist customers through every step of their Ryanair journey.
   COVID-19 - RAPID RECOVERY & GROWTH:
   Following a very badly disrupted Q1, which saw most Easter flights cancelled and a slower than expected easing 
of EU Govt. travel restrictions in May and June, traffic rebounded in Q2 with the successful rollout of the EU Digital 
Covid Certificates ("DCC") in July.  H1 bookings were mostly "close-in" and required price stimulation, particularly 
to/from the UK where consumer confidence was undermined (until early Oct.), by the UK Govt.'s confusing and 
inconsistent traffic light system.  In recent weeks, we have seen a surge in bookings for the Oct. mid-term and 
Christmas breaks and we expect this peak buoyancy to continue into Easter and S.22.  We will continue our load 
active/yield passive recovery strategy as we rebuild load factors (consistently above 80% in Q2) and, in time, yields 
over the second half of FY22.
   The Covid-19 crisis accelerated the collapse of many European airlines including Flybe, Norwegian, 
Germanwings, Level, Stobart and led to substantial capacity cuts at many others including Alitalia, TAP, LOT, SAS, 
etc.  The tsunami of State Aid from EU Govts. to their insolvent flag carriers (Alitalia, Air France/KLM, Iberia, LOT, 
Lufthansa, SAS, TAP and others) will distort EU competition and prop up high cost, inefficient, flag carriers for many 
years.  Ryanair was one of the very few airlines to use the Covid crisis to place significant aircraft orders, to expand 
our airport partnerships and to secure lower operating costs so that we can pass on even lower fares, post Covid, to 
our customers.  Together with our airport partners, we are leading Europe's traffic recovery and we plan to deliver 
accelerated growth in both traffic and jobs over the next 5 years.
   During H1 our Route Development team continued their work with airport partners across Europe, and have 
negotiated lower airport costs, recovery incentives and the extension of many low-cost airport growth deals.  In 
addition to its new base deals (Agadir, Billund, Chania, Corfu, Rhodes, Riga, Stockholm, Venice Treviso, Turin, 
Zadar & Zagreb), over 560 new route announcements and long-term extensions of low-cost growth deals in 
Stansted (to 2028), Bergamo (to 2028), Manchester (to 2028), East Midlands (to 2028), Charleroi (to 2030), the 
Group has doubled its capacity in Rome (Fiumicino), Lisbon, Vienna and will launch new bases in Cork, Newcastle 
and Venice (Marco-Polo) for S.22.
   In June Ryanair took delivery of our first B737-8200 "Gamechanger" aircraft (from our 210 orderbook) and we 
expect to have over 65 in the Group fleet by S.22.  These Gamechangers will, we believe, further widen the cost 
gap between Ryanair and all other European airlines over the next decade.  While load factors have yet to recover 
to pre-Covid levels, the performance of the Gamechangers has exceeded our expectations this summer. 
Operational reliability, fuel consumption and CO emissions have, so far, exceeded guidelines with very positive 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report
passenger and crew feedback to these new, more fuel efficient, quieter aircraft.  Based on our 210 order book and 
available fleet capacity, we plan to accelerate our traffic growth to 225m p.a. by FY26.
   H1 FY22 BUSINESS REVIEW:
   Revenue & Costs
   H1 scheduled revenues increased 61% to EUR1.27bn as traffic jumped 128% from 17.1m to 39.1m (at a 79% 
load factor). The Covid disruption of Easter traffic, the delayed relaxation of EU travel restrictions into May/June, 
and the uncertainty caused by the UK's confusing traffic light system this summer and the close-in nature of 
bookings required price stimulation - resulting in average fares of just EUR33 (down 30% on H1 last year). Ancillary 
revenue continued its strong performance, generating over EUR22.50 per passenger, as guests choose priority 
boarding and reserved seating.  Total revenue increased by over 80% to EUR2.15bn in H1.
   While sectors and traffic more than doubled, operating costs increased by just 63% to EUR2.20bn, driven 
primarily by lower variable costs such as aircraft, airport & handling, route charges and fuel.  Lower costs, coupled 
with rising load factors, led to a marked reduction in cost per passenger (ex-fuel) to EUR38.  We expect to see 
further improvements in costs as our new, lower cost, more fuel-efficient aircraft deliver and EU countries (such as 
Ireland, Spain & Italy) rollout Covid recovery incentive schemes.
   Our fuel requirements are 80% hedged for Q4 FY22 (50% jet swaps at $580, with the balance hedged with caps 
at $750 per met. tonne).  H1 FY23 is 80% hedged (60% jet swaps at $620 and 20% caps at $715) and H2 FY23 is 
60% hedged at $625.  Carbon credits are fully hedged for FY22 and 70% hedged for FY23 at EUR24 and EUR40 
per EUA respectively.
   Balance Sheet & Liquidity
   Ryanair's balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry with a BBB credit rating (S&P and Fitch), 
EUR4.24bn cash and almost 90% of our B737 fleet unencumbered. In May Ryanair issued a EUR1.2bn 5-year, 
unsecured, bond at a record low coupon of just 0.875%.  In June the Group repaid its (2014) maturing EUR850m 
1.875% bond and last week the Group repaid its UK CCFF GBP600m loan 5 months early.  Strong operating 
cashflows and supplier reimbursements, offset by capex, drove a EUR0.8bn reduction in net debt to EUR1.5bn at 
30 Sept. (31 March: EUR2.3bn).  During Q2 the Group agreed to sell its 10 oldest B737NGs.  2 of these aircraft 
were delivered in Sept. and the remainder will exit the fleet before the financial year end.  The strength of Ryanair's 
balance sheet ensures that the Group can capitalise rapidly on the many growth opportunities that exist in Europe 
in the post Covid-19 recovery.

   MD&A Half-Year Ended September 30, 2021
   Introduction
   The Ryanair Group's fleet was effectively grounded due to European Governments travel restrictions/ 
lockdowns for much of the prior year comparative (half-year ended September 30, 2020).  Sectors (up 100%) 
and traffic (+128%) are therefore significantly higher in the half-year ended September 30, 2021 (although 
still below pre Covid-19 levels) and the following discussion should be read in that context.
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues increased by 61% to EUR1,273.3M due to a 128% increase in traffic, from 17.1M to 
39.1M. While traffic increased significantly, the delayed relaxation of Government travel restrictions 
across the EU and the UK meant that fares required significant price stimulation, with average fares down 
30%.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues increased to EUR881.6M due to a 128% rebound in traffic and a solid performance in 
priority boarding and reserved seating.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -5-
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues increased by 83% to EUR2,154.9M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil increased by EUR 370.1M (+108%) to EUR713.1M due to a 100% increase in sectors flown and 
higher jet fuel prices.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges rose by EUR167.2M (+99%) to EUR336.9M due to a doubling of sectors and a 
128% increase in traffic.
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation increased by 13% to EUR336.2M, primarily due to higher amortisation resulting from 
increased aircraft utilisation and the delivery of 20 new Boeing 737-8200 aircraft in the period.
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs increased by 29% to EUR303.1M due to higher sectors.
   Route charges:
   Route charges increased by 99% to EUR230.0M, broadly in line with higher sectors.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other rose by 58% to EUR168.3M due to higher activity in the period, offset 
by cost savings.
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 43% to EUR117.8M due to higher aircraft utilisation and 
the handback of leased aircraft in the period.
   Other expense:
   Finance expenses increased by EUR29.4M to EUR44.7M due to higher gross debt and negative average 
interest rates on euro deposits.
   Balance sheet:
   Gross cash increased by EUR1.09BN to EUR4.24BN at September 30, 2021.
   Gross debt increased by EUR0.32BN to EUR5.74BN primarily due to a EUR1.20BN bond issuance in May 2021, 
offset by EUR0.94BN debt repayments and EUR29.0M lease liability payments.
   Net debt was EUR1.50BN at September 30, 2021. This is a EUR0.77BN reduction from EUR2.28BN at March 31, 
2021.
   Increased activity in the period (including a 100% increase in sectors and 128% rise in traffic), and 
higher forward bookings (unearned revenue) led to significant movements in Other Assets (+EUR0.10BN), 
Trade Payables (+EUR0.51BN), and Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities (+EUR0.67BN)
   Shareholders' equity:
   Shareholders' equity increased by EUR0.29BN to EUR4.93BN in the period primarily due to an IFRS hedge 
accounting unrealised gain for derivatives of EUR0.32BN, offset by the EUR47.6M net loss.
   MD&A Quarter Ended September 30, 2021
   Introduction
   As a result of European Government's Covid-19 travel restrictions/lockdowns during the prior year 
comparative (quarter ended September 30, 2020), the Group experienced a significant reduction in traffic. 
In the quarter ended September 30, 2021, following the rollout of EU Digital Covid Certificates in July, 
sectors rose 64% and traffic increased by 86% to 31.0M. The following discussion should be read in that 
context.
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues increased by 57% to EUR1,081.4M due to an 86% increase in traffic, from 16.7M to 
31.0M. While traffic increased significantly, the close-in nature of bookings and uncertainty around UK 
travel restrictions meant that fares required significant price stimulation.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues rose by 95% to EUR703.0M due to an 86% increase in traffic and a solid performance 
in priority boarding and reserved seating.
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues increased by 70% to EUR1,784.4M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil increased by 67% to EUR556.5M due to a 64% increase in sectors flown and higher jet fuel 
prices, offset by an improved fuel burn.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges rose 65% to EUR249.8M due to a 64% increase in sectors and 86% more 
passengers.
   Depreciation:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -5-
   Depreciation increased by 24% to EUR201.9M, primarily due to higher amortisation as a result of 
increased aircraft utilisation and the delivery of 20 new Boeing 737-8200 aircraft in the quarter.
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs increased by 16% to EUR192.1M due to higher sectors.
   Route charges:
   Route charges increased by 57% to EUR177.7M, due to 64% more sectors.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other increased by 51% to EUR96.4M due to higher activity in the quarter.
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 21% to EUR56.0M due to higher aircraft utilisation.
   Other expense:
   Finance expenses increased by EUR17.4M to EUR23.3M primarily due to higher gross debt and negative 
average interest rates on euro deposits.

   -- Principal risks and uncertainties relating to the remaining six months of the year;
   -- Related party transactions; and
   -- Post balance sheet events.
   Results of operations for the six-month period ended September 30, 2021 compared to the six-month 
period ended September 30, 2020, including important events that occurred during the half-year, are set 
forth above in the MD&A.
   Principal risks and uncertainties for the remainder of the year
   The full extent of the ongoing impact of Covid-19 on the Group's longer-term operational and financial 
performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of the Group's control, 
including the duration and spread of Covid-19 and related travel advisories and restrictions, the impact 
of Covid-19 on overall long-term demand for air travel, the impact of Covid-19 on the financial health and 
operations of the Group's business partners (particularly Boeing), and future governmental actions, all of 
which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
   Among other factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected 
results for the remainder of the year are the airline pricing environment, capacity growth in Europe, fuel 
costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the replacement of aircraft, costs 
associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, UK, European Union 
("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, delays in the delivery of 
contracted aircraft, weather related disruptions, ATC strikes and staffing related disruptions, 
uncertainties surrounding Brexit, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport 
access and charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general 
economic environment in Ireland, the UK, and Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to 
travel, other economic, social and political factors and unforeseen security events.
   Board of Directors
   With the exception of Geoff Doherty, who joined the Board in October 2021, details of the members of 
the Group's Board of Directors are set forth on page 16 of the Group's 2021 annual report.
   Related party transactions - Please see note 13.
   Post balance sheet events - Please see note 15.
   Going concern
   The Directors, having made inquiries, including consideration of the possible future financial effects 
associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for at least the next 12 months and that it is appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing these interim financial statements. While there is uncertainty as to the full 
extent of the impact on the Ryanair Group, the continued preparation of the Group's consolidated interim 
financial statements on the going concern basis is supported by the financial projections prepared by the 
Group.
   In arriving at this decision to adopt the going concern basis of accounting, the Board has considered, 
among other things:
    --      The Group's net profit of EUR225M in the quarter ended September 30, 2021;

  Ancillary revenues comprise of revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, in-flight sales and 
Internet related services. Non-flight scheduled revenue arises from the sale of priority boarding, 
allocated seats, car hire, travel insurance, room reservations and other sources, including excess baggage 
charges and other fees, all directly attributable to the low-fares business.
   The vast majority of ancillary revenue is recognized at a point in time, which is typically the flight 
date. The economic factors that would impact the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and 
cashflows associated with the provision of passenger travel related ancillary services are homogeneous 
across the various component categories within ancillary revenue. Accordingly, there is no further 
disaggregation of ancillary revenue required in accordance with IFRS 15, paragraph 114.

  Diluted earnings per share takes account solely of the potential future exercise of share options 
granted under the Company's share option schemes. For the half-year ended September 30, 2021, due to the 
loss-making position, share options are antidilutive in accordance with IAS 33 and therefore are not 
assumed to be converted. For the half-year ended September 20, 2021, the weighted average number of shares 
includes share options assumed to be converted of 11.0M (2020: 4.1M) and weighted issued share capital of 
0.4M (2020: 4.8M).
    10.          Property, plant and equipment
   Acquisitions and disposals
   During the half-year ended September 30, 2021, net capital additions amounted to EUR551M principally 
reflecting aircraft pre-delivery deposits, capitalised maintenance provisions, 20 aircraft deliveries and 
supplier reimbursements of EUR114M.
   Assets held for sale
   In the quarter ended September 30, 2021 the Group entered into an agreement to sell 10 Boeing 737-800NG 
aircraft for delivery in fiscal year 2022. 2 of these aircraft were sold in September 2021. The remaining 
8 aircraft are reflected as current assets within the Ryanair DAC airline at September 30, 2021 (Note 8).
    11.           Financial instruments and financial risk management
   The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
   These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2021 
Annual Report. While there have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year, the Group has 
started using jet fuel call options to manage the risk associated with rising fuel prices. These options 
set a maximum price that the Group will pay for fuel.
   Fair value hierarchy
   Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
   --    Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
the Group can access at the measurement date.
   --    Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    --    Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

Body
   In determining the useful lives and expected residual values of the aircraft, and the cost of major 
airframe and engine overhaul, the Group has based the estimates on a range of factors and assumptions, 
including its own historic experience and past practices of aircraft disposal and renewal programmes, 
forecasted growth plans, external valuations from independent appraisers, recommendations from the 
aircraft supplier and manufacturer and other industry available information.
   The Group's estimate of each aircraft's residual value is 15% of the current market value of new 
aircraft, and each aircraft's useful life is determined to be 23 years.  For the 20 new Boeing 737-8200 
aircraft delivered during the half-year period to September 30, 2021, the Group has determined the 
estimated useful life to be 23 years and estimated residual value to be 15% of its current market value 
upon delivery.
   Revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to maintenance programs, changes in utilization 
of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft, changes in new aircraft technology, changes 
in governmental and environmental taxes, changes in new aircraft fuel efficiency and changing market 
prices for new and used aircraft of the same or similar types.  The Group therefore evaluates its 
estimates and assumptions in each reporting period, and, when warranted, adjusts these assumptions. Any 
adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.
   The Group evaluates, at the end of each reporting period, whether there is any indication that its 
long-lived assets may be impaired. Factors that may indicate potential impairment include, but are not 
limited to, significant decrease in the market value of an aircraft based on observable information, a 
significant change in an aircraft's physical condition and operating or cash flow losses associated with 
the use of the aircraft.
    3.            Seasonality of operations
   The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly, 
the first half-year has traditionally resulted in higher revenues and profits.
    4.            Income tax expense
   The Group's consolidated tax credit for the half-year ended September 30, 2021 of EUR52.3M (tax credit 
September 30, 2020: EUR21.8M) comprises a current tax credit of EUR2.9M and a deferred tax credit of 
EUR49.4M primarily relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment and net 
operating losses.  This consolidated tax credit is the aggregation of separate tax charges and tax credits 
on the profits earned and losses suffered by each of the Group's operating companies calculated in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -7-
accordance with differing tax rules and rates applicable in each jurisdiction where the Group operates.  
No significant or unusual tax charges or credits arose during the period.  The effective tax rate of 52% 
for the half year (September 30, 2020: 5%) is the result of the mix of profits and losses incurred by 
Ryanair's operating subsidiaries primarily in Ireland, Malta, Poland and the UK.
    5.            Share based payments
   The terms and conditions of the Group's share-based remuneration programmes are disclosed in the most 
recent, published, consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR5.2M in the half-year ended 
September 30, 2021 (September 30, 2020: EUR2.1M) is the fair value of options granted in prior periods and 
a conditional share grant under LTIP 2019, in the current period, to over 80 managers across the Group 
(the Executive and Non-Executive Directors were not included in this LTIP grant). The charge is recognised 
within the income statement in accordance with employee services rendered. During the half-year ended 
September 30, 2021, 0.7M ordinary shares were issued at strike prices between EUR6.25 and EUR6.74 per 
share following the exercise of vested share options.
    6.                                      Contingencies
   The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management 
believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to materially 
adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
    7.            Capital commitments
   At September 30, 2021 the Group had an operating fleet of 438 (2020: 438) Boeing 737 and 29 (2020: 28) 
Airbus A320 aircraft. In September 2014, the Group agreed to purchase up to 200 (100 firm and 100 options) 
Boeing 737-8200 aircraft which was subsequently increased to 210 (135 firm and 75 options). In December 
2020, the Group increased its firm orders from 135 to 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft. In the half-year to 
September 30, 2021, the Group took delivery of 20 of these aircraft and expects to have over 65 Boeing 
737-8200s in the Group fleet ahead of Summer 2022. The remaining aircraft are due to be delivered before 
the end of fiscal year 2025.
    8.            Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis
   The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the Group CEO, who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).
   The Group currently comprises four key separate airlines, Buzz, Lauda, Malta Air and Ryanair DAC. 
Ryanair DAC and Malta Air are separate reportable segments as they each exceed the applicable quantitative 
thresholds for reporting purposes. Buzz and Lauda do not individually exceed the quantitative thresholds

   Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
   Interim Financial Statements
    1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies

   These

condensed 
consolidated 
interim 
financial 
statements 
("the 
interim 
financial

2021, have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU ("IAS 
34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements and should 
be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated financial statements of the Group. The

Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -6-
   The September 30, 2021 figures and the September 30, 2020 comparative figures do not constitute 
statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The

those financial statements was unqualified.
   The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements for the half-year ended September 30, 2021 on October 29, 2021.
   Except as stated otherwise below, this year's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
   New IFRS standards and amendments adopted during the year
   The following new and amended standards, amendments and interpretations, have been issued by the IASB, 
and have also been endorsed by the EU (unless otherwise stated). These standards are effective for the 
first time for the Group's financial year beginning on April 1, 2021. The adoption of these new or amended 
standards did not have either a material impact, or any impact, on the Group's financial position or 
performance in the half-year ended September 30, 2021.

on or after April 1, 2021).
   New IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
   The following new or amended standards and interpretations will be adopted for the purposes of the 
preparation of future financial statements, where applicable.  While under review, we do not anticipate 
that the adoption of the other new or revised standards and interpretations will have any or a material 
impact on our financial position or performance:
    --    Annual Improvements 2018-2020 (effective on or after January 1, 2022).
   --    Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: Onerous Contracts

   * These standards or amendments to standards are not as of yet EU endorsed.
    2.            Judgements and estimates
   In preparing these condensed interim financial statements, management has made judgements and estimates 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
   In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the most recent published 
consolidated financial statements.
   Derivative financial instruments
   The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, 
including the risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates. Ryanair uses 
forward contracts and options for the purchase of its jet fuel (jet kerosene) requirements to reduce its 
exposure to commodity price risk. It also uses foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure 
to risks related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the purchase 
of new Boeing 737 aircraft and the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the purchase of jet fuel.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -6-
   The Group recognises all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in its consolidated 
balance sheet and measures them at fair value. At September 30, 2021, a net asset of EUR238.0M (March 31, 
2021: net liability EUR46.0M) was recognised on balance sheet in respect of the Group's jet fuel 
derivative instruments and a net asset of EUR247.0M (March 31, 2021: net asset EUR171.0M) was recognised 
in respect of its foreign currency derivative instruments associated with future aircraft purchases.
   In determining the hedge effectiveness of derivative instruments used to hedge Ryanair's fuel 
requirements, there is significant judgement involved in assessing whether the volumes of jet fuel hedged 
are still expected to be highly probable forecast transactions. Specifically, significant judgement is 
required in respect of the assumptions related to the timing of the full removal of flight restrictions 
imposed by governments relating to the Covid-19 pandemic, the expected recovery of passenger demand and 
the subsequent flight schedules. All of these assumptions impact upon forecast fuel consumption, and minor 
changes to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
   In respect of foreign currency hedge effectiveness for future aircraft purchases, there is a high 
degree of judgement involved in assessing whether the future aircraft payments are still considered highly 
probable of occurring, and the timing of these future payments for aircraft. The timing of future payments 
for aircraft is dependent on the aircraft manufacturer's ability to meet forecast aircraft delivery 
schedules.
   As at September 30, 2021 the Group had entered into forward jet fuel hedging contracts covering 
approximately 60% of its estimated requirements for fiscal year 2022 and approximately 50% of its 
estimated requirements for fiscal year 2023. The Group believes these hedges to be effective for hedge 
accounting purposes.
   Long-lived assets - Useful lives, residual values and impairment
   As at the half-year ended September 30, 2021, the Group had EUR8,489.9M of property, plant and 
equipment long-lived assets, of which EUR8,321.5M were aircraft. In accounting for long-lived assets, the 
Group must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of 
the assets, the cost of major airframe and engine overhaul.

   During the half-year to September 30, 2021, many European countries in which the Ryanair Group operates 
continued to make available payroll support schemes. The Ryanair Group utilised a number of these 
employment retention schemes to protect jobs within the Group. These schemes were a mix of short term 
Covid-19 specific programmes and long-term schemes linked to social security that existed pre Covid-19. 
The total amount of payroll supports received by the Group under the various schemes amounted to 
approximately EUR42M (2020: EUR44M) and are offset against staff costs in the Consolidated Income 
Statement.
   In April 2020, the Group raised GBP600M unsecured debt for general corporate purposes under the HMT and 
Bank of England CCFF. The 0.44% interest rate was the prevailing rate for strong BBB rated companies. This 
debt was extended in March 2021 for a further 12 months at a 0.46% interest rate.
   There are no unfulfilled conditions attaching to government assistance at September 30, 2021.
    15.          Post balance sheet events
   In October 2021 the Group repaid the GBP600M HMT and Bank of England CCFF in full.

Chief Executive
   October 29, 2021
   Independent review report to Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   Introduction
   We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed set of consolidated financial statements in 
the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended September 30, 2021 which comprises the condensed 
consolidated interim balance sheet, the condensed consolidated interim income statement, the condensed 
consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, the condensed consolidated interim statement of 
cash flows, and the condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in shareholders' equity and the 
related explanatory notes. Our review was conducted having regard to the Financial Reporting Council's 
International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial 
Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity'.
   Conclusion
   Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set 
of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 
September 30, 2021 is not prepared, in all material respects in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial 
Reporting' as adopted by the EU, the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 ("Transparency 
Directive"), and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland.
   Directors' responsibilities
   The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the Directors. The 
Directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the 
Transparency Directive and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland. As disclosed in note 1, 
the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU. The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the condensed 
set of consolidated financial statements included in this half-yearly financial report has been prepared 
in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU.
   Our responsibility
   Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of consolidated 
financial statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review.
   Scope of review
   We conducted our review having regard to the Financial Reporting Council's International Standard on 
Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, 
primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other 
review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that 
we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do 
not express an audit opinion.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -10-
   We read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of consolidated financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the review. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies, we consider the implications for our report.
   The purpose of our review work and to whom we owe our responsibilities
   This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the 
Company in meeting the requirements of the Transparency Directive and the Transparency Rules of the 
Central Bank of Ireland. Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those 
matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company for our 
review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached.

   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
   Financial instruments measured at fair value
   --    Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine 
their fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. The Group's credit risk and 
counterparty's credit risk is taken into account when establishing fair value (Level 2).
   --          Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel swap contracts and EUA contracts: A 
comparison of the contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at 
September 30, 2021 has been used to establish fair value. The Group's credit risk and counterparty's 
credit risk is taken into account when establishing fair value (Level 2).
   --          Derivatives - aircraft fuel options:   T he fair value of aircraft fuel options is 
determined based on market accepted valuation techniques, primarily Black-Scholes modelling (Level 2).
   The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the quarter ended September 30, 2021, 
there were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
   Financial instruments not measured at fair value
   --          Long-term debt: The repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at September 30, 2021 to 
arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
   While there have been improvements in business and economic circumstances during the quarter ended 
September 30, 2021, the future outlook for the business is such that there has been no material change to 
the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities.
   The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated balance sheet, are as follows:

the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.

(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who

   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.

2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments

Competition and Markets Authority CMA closes probe into British Airways and Ryanair
Competition and Markets Authority CMA closes probe into British Airways 
and Ryanair

   Competition and Markets Authority
   07 October 2021
   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 7 OCTOBER 2021
   CMA closes investigation into British Airways and Ryanair
   The CMA has concluded that a lack of clarity in the law makes it insufficiently certain that it would 
be able to secure refunds for customers of British Airways and Ryanair who were prevented from flying by 
Covid travel restrictions.
   In June 2021, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a probe into the airlines over 
concerns they may have broken the law by failing to offer refunds for flights customers could not legally 
take during periods of lockdown. Instead, British Airways offered customers vouchers or rebooking and 
Ryanair provided the option to rebook.
   After a thorough examination of relevant law, and the evidence it had gathered during its 
investigation, the CMA has concluded that the law does not provide passengers with a sufficiently clear 
right to a refund in these unusual circumstances to justify continuing with the case.
   Consumer protection law sets out that passengers are entitled to refunds when an airline cancels a 
flight, because the firm cannot provide its contracted services. However, it does not clearly cover 
whether people should be refunded when their flight goes ahead but they are legally prohibited from taking 
it.
   Following its review of the law and evidence, alongside expert advice, the CMA concluded that 
prolonging this investigation could not be justified given the length of time it would take to reach an 
outcome in the courts and the uncertain outcome. Considering this, and given the CMA can only enforce the 
law as it stands, it has decided to close the investigation.
   Andrea Coscelli, Chief Executive of the CMA, said:
   "We strongly believe people who are legally prevented from taking flights due to lockdown laws should 
be offered a full refund and we launched this investigation in the hope that we would be able to secure a 
positive outcome for consumers.  However, after considering the relevant law and gathering evidence in our 
investigation, we have concluded that the length of time that would be required to take this case through 
the courts, and the uncertain outcome, can no longer justify the further expense of public money.
   "Given the importance of this to many passengers who have unfairly lost out, we hope that the law in 
this area will be clarified."
Competition and Markets Authority CMA closes probe into British Airways and Ryanair
   This case is different from other instances where the CMA has secured refunds for customers. For 
example, in the package travel sector, customers are protected by a separate set of laws, the Package 
Travel Regulations, which give consumers refund rights that the CMA was able to enforce. The CMA was also 
able to take effective action to get consumers refunds in several other sectors, such as weddings and 
holiday lets. In these cases, the legal position was different, in particular because lockdown legislation 
made it unlawful for businesses to operate - unlike airlines, who were permitted to continue flights.
   CMA action has already led to commitments to refund hundreds of millions of pounds for people whose 
holidays were cancelled due to the pandemic, including from LoveHolidays , Lastminute.com , Virgin 
Holidays , TUI UK , Sykes Cottages , and Vacation Rentals .

   Notes to editors
   1.   In April 2021, the Department for Transport issued a taskforce report putting further measures in 
place to ensure travellers' money is safe in case bookings are cancelled wherever possible. This also 
included plans to reform the enforcement powers of the sector regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to 
better tackle consumer law breaches.
   2.   For most affected passengers, British Airways offered credit voucher and fee-free rebooking 
options, whilst Ryanair offered a fee-free rebooking option.
   3.   Ryanair told us it had repaid a small number of people having reviewed the specifics of their 
cases.

   GEOFF DOHERTY TO JOIN BOARD OF RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC
   The Board of Ryanair Holdings PLC today (1 Oct) announced the appointment of Mr. Geoff P. Doherty as a non-
executive director with immediate effect. Mr Doherty is the current CFO of Kingspan Group PLC, where he is also a 
member of the Board of Directors. Mr Doherty has extensive PLC experience having previously been a member of 
the Greencore  Group PLC Board as well as Kingspan. A qualified chartered accountant, Mr Doherty will also join 
Ryanair's Audit Committee.
   Ryanair's Chairman Stan McCarthy said:
   "We are very pleased to welcome Geoff Doherty to the Board of Ryanair Holdings. Given Geoff's considerable 
experience and skills in the field of finance, as both a main Board Director and CFO, he will, we believe, be a 
significant and valuable addition to both our Board and our Audit Committee.
   Geoff is currently the CFO of Kingspan Group, which is a company Ryanair greatly admires. Like them, Ryanair is 
growing rapidly, investing heavily in new environmentally efficient technology, is capitalising on significant growth 
opportunities post Covid-19, and is expanding rapidly across many European markets outside of Ireland. We are 
delighted to welcome Geoff to the team, and we all look forward to working with him over the coming years to 
achieve Ryanair's exciting and ambitious growth and environmental goals."

   Ideagen PLC
   ("Ideagen," "the Company" or the "Group")
   Change of Auditor
   Ideagen PLC (AIM: IDEA), a leading supplier of Information Management Software to highly regulated industries , 
announces the appointment of KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as the Group's new external auditor with effect from, and 
subject to the approval of shareholders at, the Company's forthcoming annual general meeting on 27 October 2021. 
This follows a competitive tender process led by the Group's Audit and Risk Committee.
   RSM UK Audit LLP ("RSM") did not participate in this tender process given their long tenure as the Group's 
auditor and will cease to hold office at the end of their term, before KPMG's appointment becomes effective.
   Ideagen wishes to express its appreciation and gratitude to RSM for its service over the last eleven years.

   As support packages unwind, we expect there to be some capital needs that may throw up interesting 
opportunities for us to act.  Currently we find the most valuable activity we can do with the portfolio is the most 
undervalued and underrated of all, which is to do nothing.  We would have done a lot better over the past 23 years 
if we had been better at doing nothing.
   Upside to intrinsic value is our key metric when we consider valuation. At the time of writing in late-September it 
stands at 80%, which highlights the potential in the portfolio.
   Castelnau Group
   In the same June 2021 factsheet, we announced that the Castelnau Group vehicle would be listed in the near 
future, and it was our intention, with the Board's agreement, that Aurora participate. The Board agreed but the 
participation required a shareholder vote because the Company is presently unable to hold a fund which Phoenix 
manages. The General Meeting was held on 28 September 2021 at which shareholders approved all resolutions 
proposed, including an amendment to the Company's Investment Policy and authorising the Company to 
participate.
   The Castelnau Group Prospectus was published on 23 September 2021 and trading will begin on 18 October 
2021. As outlined in previous communication, the Company will exchange shares in Dignity PLC, Hornby and 
Phoenix Stanley Gibbons for shares in Castelnau Group. The initial weight of Castelnau Group in the Company's 
portfolio will be 15%.

  INTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT
   The Directors are required to provide an Interim Management Report in accordance with the Financial 
Conduct Authority's ("FCA") Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules ("DTR"). The Directors consider 
that the Investment Manager's Review shown above provide details of the important events which have 
occurred during the period and their impact on the financial statements. The following statement on the 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties, the Related Party Transactions, the Statement of Directors' 
Responsibilities and the Investment Manager's Review together constitute the Interim Management Report of 
the Company for the six months ended 30 June 2020. The outlook for the Company for the remaining six 
months of the year ending 31 December 2020 is discussed in the Investment Manager's Review.
   Details of the investments held at the period end and the structure of the portfolio at the period end 
are provided above.
   PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
   The principal risks and uncertainties of the Company are detailed on pages 27 to 29 of the Company's 
most recent Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2020 which can be found on the Company's website 
at www.aurorainvestmenttrust.com. The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company remain 
unchanged from those disclosed in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2020 and the Board are 
of the opinion that they will continue to remain unchanged for the forthcoming six month period.
   The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company are as follows:
    --         Brexit;
   --         Portfolio Risk: including poor stock selection, poor use of gearing, illiquid stock and a 
concentrated portfolio;
    --         The COVID-19 pandemic which continues to impact the Company;
    --         Operational Risks; and
    --         Corporate governance and regulatory risks.
   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Aurora Investment Trust PLC Half-year Report -2-
   The Company's Investment Manager is Phoenix Asset Management Partners Limited, ('Phoenix' or the 
'Investment Manager'). Phoenix is considered a related party in accordance with the Listing Rules. Phoenix 
does not earn an ongoing annual management fee. It will be paid an annual performance fee equal to one 
third of the outperformance of the Company's net asset value total return (including dividends and 
adjusted for the impact of share buybacks and the issue of new shares) over the FTSE All-Share Index total 
return for each financial year. Details of the investment management arrangements are shown in note 5 
below.
   The Board are also considered related parties. Further details of the Board's remuneration and 
shareholdings can be found on page 54 of the Company's Annual Report.
   At a General Meeting held on 28 September 2021 shareholders approved the transfer of certain of the 
Company's assets to Castelnau Group ('Castelnau'), a company managed by Phoenix, in exchange for shares in 
Castelnau. As a result of managing Castelnau, the Investment Manager may be paid a performance fee by 
Castelnau. As explained above, Phoenix is a related party of the Company and will benefit from the 
Company's transaction with Castelnau through the establishment of the new fund. Therefore, the transfer of 
assets by the Company to Castelnau in exchange for shares in Castelnau constitutes a related party 
transaction under LR11.1.7R.
   GOING CONCERN
   The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation, after making enquiries, that the Company has adequate resources to continue in existence for 
at least 12 months from the date of approval of this document. In reaching this conclusion, the Directors 
have considered the liquidity of the Company's portfolio of investments as well as its cash position, 
income and expense flows. As at 30 June 2021, the Company held GBP10,605,000 (30 June 2020: GBP6,591,000) 
in cash, GBP152,787,000 (30 June 2020: GBP107,349,000) in quoted investments and GBP13,327,000 (30 June 
2020: GBP7,601,000) in an unquoted investment. It is estimated that the majority of the portfolio could be 
realised in seven days under normal conditions. The total operating expenses for the six months to 30 June 
2021 was GBP349,000 (30 June 2020: GBP299,000).
   In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Directors have fully considered and assessed the Company's 
portfolio of investments. A prolonged and deep market decline could lead to falling values in the 
Company's investments or interruptions to cashflow. However, the Company currently has more than 
sufficient liquidity available to meet any future obligations.
   The market and operational risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing economic impact 
of measures introduced to combat its spread are continually monitored by the Board. The Investment 
Manager, Administrator and other key service providers are providing regular updates on operational 
resilience, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board is satisfied that the key service providers have 
the ability to continue their operations efficiently in a remote or virtual working environment.

   16 September 2021
   RYANAIR BOARD APPROVES ACCELERATED POST COVID GROWTH
   NEW AIRCRAFT, NEW BASES & LOWER COSTS, SEES 5 YEAR TRAFFIC GROWTH JUMP 50% FROM 150M TO 225M GUESTS 
P.A.
   Ryanair Holdings plc, today (Thurs, 16(th) Sept) holds its AGM at its Airside Offices in Dublin.
   Based on proxy votes already received, Shareholders have approved all resolutions and will receive a 
detailed update on the Airline Group's post-Covid recovery plans over the next 5 years. Subject to no 
adverse Covid developments, and vaccinations remaining at 90%+ across Europe, Ryanair will take delivery 
of 210 B737 Gamechanger aircraft over the next 5 years. These aircraft will deliver industry lowest costs, 
reduced emissions, and will enable Ryanair accelerate its post-Covid growth, as opportunities open up at 
primary and secondary airports all over Europe, particularly where legacy carriers have failed or reduced 
fleet sizes as a result of Covid and State Aid.
   Ryanair Group airlines now expect to deliver more rapid traffic growth over the next 5 years, and have 
raised their 5 year growth forecast from 33% to 50%. As a result, Ryanair's pre-Covid traffic of 149m is 
expected to grow to over 225m guests by March 2026, which is 25m passengers p.a. higher than the previous 
target of 200m.
   Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
   " The performance of the B737 Gamechanger aircraft this summer has exceeded our expectations. 
Operational reliability, fuel consumption, and lower CO2 emissions have so far exceeded guidelines with 
very positive passenger and crew feedback to these new, more fuel efficient, quieter aircraft.
   With these new deliveries, Ryanair will open 10 new bases across Europe this year as we work with 
airport partners to help them recover traffic & jobs post Covid, and take up slot opportunities that are 
being vacated by competitor airlines who have collapsed or significantly reduced their fleet sizes.
   Ryanair expects to create over 5,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers over the next 5 
years, and the Group is excited to have, earlier this week, opened a EUR50m Aviation Training Centre in 
Dublin, with 2 further high quality training centres planned for Spain and Poland over the next 5 years.
   The Covid-19 pandemic has delivered an unprecedented blow to Europe's aviation and tourism industries. 
Only Ryanair has used this crisis to place significantly increased aircraft orders, to expand our airport 
partnerships, and to secure lower operating costs so that we can pass on even lower fares to our guests, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC AGM Statement
so that together with our airport partners, we can recover strongly from the Covid pandemic and deliver 
higher than expected growth in both traffic and jobs over the next 5 years."

   Headline: Forced Sale of Ryanair Ordinary Shares
   8 September 2021
   RYANAIR INITIATES FORCED SALE OF ORDINARY SHARES ACQUIRED IN BREACH OF LONG-STANDING NON-EU NATIONAL 
PROHIBITION
   As previously advised ( https://investor.ryanair.com/brexit/ ) and as specifically referenced by 
Ryanair Holdings PLC (the "Company") in its announcement on 29 December 2020, the prohibition on non-EU 
nationals acquiring Ordinary Shares in the Company, as first announced by the Company on 5 February 2002, 
continues to apply. As a result of Brexit, Ordinary Shares in the Company which have been acquired by or 
on behalf of UK nationals (like all other non-EU nationals) since 1 January 2021 have been treated as 
"Restricted Shares" and such non-EU national investors have been issued with Restricted Share Notices by 
the Company requiring them to dispose of their interests in such Restricted Shares to EU nationals. This 
is necessary to ensure continued compliance by the Company and its EU airline subsidiaries with the 
airline ownership and control requirements of EU Regulation 1008/2008.
   While the above restrictions continue to be complied with by the vast majority of investors in the 
Company, the Company has recorded a number of acquisitions of its Ordinary Shares by non-EU nationals 
since 1 January 2021 in respect of which the relevant investors have not complied with the disposal 
requirements in the Restricted Share Notices issued to them by the Company.  The Company has initiated the 
forced sale of approx. 1 million Ordinary Shares in accordance with its Articles of Association. The 
Company has appointed a broker to conduct the sale(s) of such Ordinary Shares independently of, and 
uninfluenced by, the Company over a period of weeks.  The net proceeds of such sale(s) will be transmitted 
to the relevant investors in due course.
   It is expected that the Company may initiate further forced sales of Restricted Shares from time to 
time in accordance with its Articles of Association and the Company may elect to do so without any further 
announcement.
   For the avoidance of doubt:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Forced Sale of Ryanair Ordinary Shares
   --          the prohibition on non-EU nationals acquiring Ordinary Shares in the Company, as announced 
by the Company on 5 February 2002, continues to apply. Since 1 January 2021, UK nationals (like all other 
non-EU nationals) are not permitted to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company;
   --           non-EU nationals (including UK nationals) can continue to invest in the Company via its 
American Depositary Receipt program on NASDAQ;
   --          UK nationals are not required to sell any Ordinary Shares which they owned prior to 1 
January 2021 but such shareholders do not have the right to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting 
of the Company in respect of those Ordinary Shares pursuant to Article 41(J)(i) of the Company's Articles 
of Association; and
   --          for these purposes, a non-EU national means a national of any jurisdiction which is not 
considered to be a "Member State" for the purposes of Article 4 of EU Regulation 1008/2008 (as amended 
from time to time), including the member states of the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and 
Liechtenstein.

   RYANAIR NEGOTIATIONS FOR A BOEING MAX10 ORDER END WITHOUT AGREEMENT
   Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (Mon 6(th) Sept) announced that its negotiations with Boeing for 
a MAX10 order (to follow its current deliveries for 210 B737-8200 "Gamechanger" aircraft) have ended 
without any agreement on pricing.
   Ryanair will take delivery of over 200 B737 "Gamechanger" aircraft over the next 5 years from 2021 to 
2025. These deliveries will see Ryanair's fleet grow to over 600 aircraft capable of carrying over 200m 
guests p.a.
   Ryanair and Boeing have been in discussions about a large follow on order for Boeing MAX10 aircraft 
over the past 10 months. However, last week it became clear that the pricing gap between the partners 
could not be closed and accordingly, both sides have agreed to waste no more time on these negotiations.
   Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
    " We are disappointed we couldn't reach agreement with Boeing on a MAX10 order. However, Boeing have a 
more optimistic outlook on aircraft pricing than we do, and we have a disciplined track record of not 
paying high prices for aircraft.
   We have a more than sufficient order pipeline to allow us to grow strongly over the next 5 years with a 
Boeing 737 fleet, which will rise to over 600 aircraft and will enable Ryanair to capitalise on the 
extraordinary growth opportunities that are emerging all over Europe as the Continent recovers from the 
Covid pandemic.
   We do not share Boeing's optimistic pricing outlook, although this may explain why in recent weeks 
other large Boeing customers such as Delta and Jet2, have been placing new orders with Airbus, rather than 
Boeing".

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring 
temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
of Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person 
or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or

duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;

Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;

Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.

presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

acquiring, disposing of or exercising voting rights in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h)

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring 
temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
of Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person 
or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or 
legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity who has a life interest in shares if that 
person or entity is entitled to exercise the voting rights attached to the shares and the natural person 
or legal entity who is disposing of the voting rights when the life interest is created;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;
Ryanair Holdings PLC Holding(s) in Company -2-
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].
   (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be 
presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 
596/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.
   9 August  2021
   Esken Limited
   ("Esken" or the "Group")
   Update of Ryanair closure of London Southend Airport Base
   Esken today provides an update following the announcement that Ryanair had decided to close its base at 
London Southend Airport ( 'LSA') with effect from 1 November 2021.
   David Shearer, Executive Chairman of Esken commented,
   "The terms of the deal which had been entered into with Ryanair in 2018 were based on a significantly different 
set of market and economic parameters to the present day. We are therefore commercially agnostic to this decision 
and will look to build sustainable and profitable passenger growth for LSA with a range of other carriers as demand 
recovers into a post pandemic world."
   "LSA has a catchment area of c8 million people resident within one hour travelling time from the airport, a regular 
direct train connection to London Liverpool Street station, a cost efficient base of operation for airlines and an 
enhanced safe passenger experience for post COVID-19 travel. The fundamental commercial rationale for LSA 
remains strong and our partnership announced recently  with Carlyle will allow us to capitalise on that opportunity 
as passenger demand recovers."
   Ryanair currently has two based planes operating out of LSA but schedules, load factors and yields have been 
affected significantly by the uncertain market in aviation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Following a review 
Esken Limited Airline update
of its network Ryanair has decided to redeploy these aircraft to its other bases to improve its own overall network 
efficiency with effect from the start of the winter flying season.
   The impact on both EBITDA and cash headroom in FY22 will be negligible in view of the expectation of limited 
flying in the winter season. In relation to FY23 management have time to implement  mitigating actions which will 
include cost savings and deferral of discretionary capital expenditure and attracting new carriers into LSA to operate 
the routes vacated by Ryanair. The impact on EBITDA and cash headroom in FY23 if no such actions were taken is 
expected to be around GBP1.4 million against the Reasonable Worst Case Scenario as set out in Prospectus and 
Circular issued on 28 July 2021. The ring fenced funding facility for the airport has adequate headroom to cover any 
such potential impact.
   Esken remains focussed on targeting airlines for the recovery of flying in summer 22 when demand is expected to 
show a recovery post COVID-19. The Group is in active dialogue with a range of Low Cost and Flagship Carriers 
where the previously proven route profitability, the airport's efficient operating cost base and the safe passenger 
experience is likely to prove attractive as demand recovers.
   The announcement by Ryanair does not have any impact on the investment into LSA announced with Carlyle 
Global Infrastructure Fund ( 'Carlyle') or the new banking facilities referred to in the Prospectus and Circular.

   Ryanair closes London Southend Airport base
   Esken, the aviation and energy infrastructure group, has today been informed that Ryanair has stated its intention 
to close its base at London Southend Airport with effect from the start of the winter season this year. As a result, 
Ryanair will cease operations based from London Southend Airport from 1 November 2021.
   Ryanair signed a five-year agreement to base three aircraft at London Southend Airport in 2018 and commenced 
operations 1(st) April 2019. The airline has had two aircraft in operation since 2020, following a reduction driven by 
the pandemic. However, Ryanair's performance at London Southend Airport has been further affected by the 
COVID-19 pandemic and has now resulted in this decision.
   Esken is currently in the process of reviewing the impact of such decision on its forecasts. However, the financial 
impact of Ryanair's base closure will be mitigated by a reduction in costs directly associated with serving Ryanair's 
base and the low level of passengers expected during the winter season.
   Esken will provide a further update as soon as it is able.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Note:
  (1) Group central and eliminations revenue comprises rental income,
  brand licence income and merchandising income.
  Aviation
   Total revenue in the Aviation operating division increased by GBP17.4 million, or 44.1 per cent., to 
GBP56.8 million in the year ended 29 February 2020 from GBP39.4 million in the year ended 28 February 
2019. Passenger numbers increased 43.1 per cent. to 2.14 million in FY20, primarily driven by new 
relationships with Ryanair, Wizz Air, Loganair and FlyOne, each of which began operating flights at London 
Southend Airport in FY20. In addition, the Group entered into a strategic partnership with the Tees Valley 
Combined Authority to provide management services in respect of the Teesside International Airport, which 
has subsequently been terminated.
   In addition, the Group announced in October 2019 that it had entered into a two-year agreement with a 
global logistics customer to provide facilities and expertise to support the import and export of goods at 
London Southend Airport. Stobart Aviation Services added 13 new customers in FY20 and provided services to 
16 airlines across five airports in the United Kingdom at the end of that financial year.
   Energy
   Total revenue in the Energy operating division increased by GBP11.2 million, or 17.2 per cent., to 
GBP76.3 million in the year ended 29 February 2020 from GBP65.1 million in the year ended 28 February 
2019. Tonnes of waste wood fuel supplied increased 11.5 per cent. to 1.5 million tonnes in FY20, primarily 
due to the maturing state of the biomass energy plants the Group supplies, with all of the Group's biomass 
Esken Limited Proposed Firm Placing and Open -28-
energy plant customers having successfully completed commissioning and being fully operational as at the 
end of FY20.
   The Tilbury biomass energy plant experienced a seven-month unplanned outage caused by a dust explosion. 
This meant that the plant was not in a position to receive its contracted supply of waste wood fuel from 
the Group, leading to in excess of 100,000 tonnes of waste wood being diverted to other customers and 
processing sites across the United Kingdom, causing the Group to incur significant costs and losses. 
During FY21, a settlement of GBP3.1 million was reached with Tilbury Green Power over the contractual 
'take or pay' amounts due. As part of this one-off settlement, GBP2.4 million was recognised within 
revenue under IFRS 15 by applying contract modification accounting.
   Rail & Civils
   Total revenue in the Rail & Civils operating division decreased by GBP10.9 million, or 20.8 per cent., 
to GBP41.5 million in the year ended 29 February 2020 from GBP52.3 million in the year ended 28 February 
2019. This decrease was primarily due to delays in Network Rail awarding contracts at the start of its 
Control Period 6 and the Group's continued exposure to a poor performing legacy project. Included in total 
revenue for Rail & Civils in FY20 is GBP13.4 million of internal revenue (FY19: GBP20.5 million), which 
comprises revenue from projects for other Group divisions and which is eliminated on consolidation.
   Other income
   Other income was GBP4.7 million in the year ended 29 February 2020 (compared to GBP1.3 million in the 
year ended 28 February 2019). In February 2020, the Group entered into a settlement deed with a renewable 
energy plant owner under which the long-term fuel supply agreement was terminated. In recognition of the 
future revenue forgone and with the plant confirming that it was no longer intending to operate a waste 
wood fuel boiler, consideration payable to the Group was agreed at an amount less than GBP5.0 million.
   Operating expenses
   Operating expenses increased by GBP25.5 million, or 16.7 per cent., to GBP178.3 million in the year 
ended 29 February 2020 from GBP152.8 million in the year ended 28 February 2019. The increase was 
primarily due to the increases in Stobart Aviation and Stobart Energy, as discussed in the divisional 
breakdowns below, partially offset by the decrease in Stobart Rail & Civils and a decrease in charges for 
litigation and claims, which in FY19 resulted from the costs of a High Court dispute with Andrew Tinkler, 
the Group's former Chief Executive.
   Aviation
   Operating expenses in the Aviation operating division increased by GBP18.4 million, or 47.1 per cent., 
to GBP57.5 million in the year ended 29 February 2020 from GBP39.2 million in the year ended 28 February 
2019. This increase was primarily due to the division's increased revenue during the year, as well as an 
increase in new business and contract set-up costs related to route development at London Southend Airport 
(GBP9.3 million). In addition, jet fuel costs increased as a percentage of the division's costs as a 
result of increased jet fuel sales as the number of aircraft movements increased at the Group's airports.
   Energy
   Operating expenses in the Energy operating division increased by GBP14.2 million, or 27.4 per cent., to 
GBP66.1 million in the year ended 29 February 2020 from GBP51.9 million in the year ended 28 February 
2019. This increase was primarily due to the division's increased revenue during the year, as well as an 
increase in new business and contract set-up costs related to delayed commissioning at certain of the 
Group's customers (GBP2.3 million) and the unplanned outage at the Tilbury biomass energy plant (GBP6.9 
million). In addition, direct material costs increased as a percentage of the division's costs as a result 
of the Group's biomass energy plant customers completing their commissioning phases. The division's other 
significant cost inputs, such as staff costs, are largely fixed costs.
   Rail & Civils
   Operating expenses in the Rail & Civils operating division decreased by GBP8.9 million, or 15.5 per 
cent., to GBP48.6 million in the year ended 29 February 2020 from GBP57.5 million in the year ended 28 
February 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in Stobart Rail & Civils' revenue during 
the year.
   Share of post-tax profits of associates and joint ventures
   Share of post-tax profits of associates and joint ventures was a loss of GBP9.8 million in the year 
ended 29 February 2020, compared to a loss of GBP1.7 million in the year ended 28 February 2019. The 
change was primarily due to the increase in equity accounted losses of Connect Airways up to the value of 
its investment (GBP9.1 million). Connect Airways, and its subsidiary Flybe, entered Administration 
following FY20 year end and the Group has impaired all outstanding balances to nil.
   Adjusted EBITDA
   Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of GBP13.2 million in the year ended 29 February 2020, compared to a loss of 
GBP6.3 million in the year ended 28 February 2019, driven by the movements in the Group's revenue, 
operating expenses, other income and share of post-tax profits of associates and joint ventures, as 
discussed above. Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this announcement is referred to as EBITDA in the FY19 
Financial Statements and FY20 Financial Statements.

   Loss on swaps
   Loss on swaps was a loss of GBP0.3 million in the year ended 29 February 2020, compared to a loss of 
GBP0.4 million in the year ended 28 February 2019. This change was primarily due to a downturn in fuel 
prices partly offset by currency exchange rates.
   Depreciation
   Depreciation increased by GBP6.4 million, or 39.4 per cent., to GBP22.7 million in the year ended 29 
February 2020 from GBP16.3 million in the year ended 28 February 2019. This increase was primarily due to 
additional assets recognised on transition to IFRS 16 (GBP3.7 million) and the further development of 
London Southend Airport (GBP1.0 million).
   Amortisation
   Amortisation increased by GBP3.5 million, or 89.3 per cent., to GBP7.5 million in the year ended 29 
February 2020 from GBP3.9 million in the year ended 28 February 2019. This increase was primarily due to 
the Eddie Stobart brand, which until May 2020 was owned by the Group. Following a review of the brand 
during FY20, the residual value was reduced, resulting in an increased annual amortisation charge.
   Impairment-Other
   The Group's impairments-other in the year ended 29 February 2020 were GBP56.8 million, comprising:
   --      a GBP21.0 million write down of Carlisle Lake District Airport. Regional connectivity was 
affected by the failure of Flybe, and so the Group recognised the likely importance of the land ownership 
rather than the commercial aviation opportunities;
   --      a GBP19.9 million impairment of the Eddie Stobart and Stobart brands following the sale to 
Eddie Stobart;
    --      the GBP8.5 million write off of goodwill and brand value in Stobart Rail & Civils;
   --      a GBP5.0 million and GBP0.7 million write down of the Stobart Infrastructure Widnes and Runcorn 
properties, respectively, reflecting the commercial reality of development land in the North West of 
England; and
   --      a GBP1.8 million write down of the Group's investment in AirportR to reflect the value achieved 
on its latest fundraising.
   The Group's impairments in the year ended 28 February 2019 were GBP7.8 million, primarily relating to a 
decrease in value of PPE at the water port and storage site at Weston Point, Runcorn (GBP6.5 million) and 
property inventory at the Widnes site (GBP1.3 million).
   Impairments-Loan receivables from joint venture
   The Group's impairments-loan receivables from joint ventures in the year ended 29 February 2020 were 
GBP45.1 million, comprising the write down of the Connect Airways loans that were deemed to have nil 
value.

   --      After security, passengers moved through to a large, open-plan departure lounge and were 
encouraged to socially distance. Whilst the airport's main retail outlets remained closed, a new pop-up 
café was introduced serving hot drinks and snacks. Vending machines were also located throughout the 
terminal.
   Stobart Aviation Services
   Stobart Aviation Services began operating in FY17/18 and provides check-in, baggage handling and cargo 
services at London Stansted, London Southend and Manchester airports. The Group has contracts with 13 
airlines, including Scandinavian airlines (SAS), Wizz Air, Titan, Ryanair, Norwegian, Eurowings and SN 
Brussels. The Group's Aviation Services contracts employ cost-plus, fixed cost and price per turn 
contracts used to appeal to both larger and smaller airlines to be handled on a frequent or ad hoc basis, 
and the contracts vary in duration, but are typically three to five years.
   Airport Regulation
   The Group's airports are regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority ("CAA"). The CAA is the independent 
aviation regulator in the United Kingdom, responsible for economic regulation, airspace policy, safety and 
consumer protection.
   Under the current regulatory regime, the Group's airports will not be subject to economic regulation by 
the CAA unless one or part of them is found in the future to satisfy the significant market power test set 
out in the Civil Aviation Act 2012.
   Other duties to which the CAA must have regard include:
   --      the need to secure that each holder of a licence is able to finance its provision of airport 
operation services in the area for which the licence is granted;
    --      the need to secure that all reasonable demands for airport operation services are met;
   --      the need to promote economy and efficiency on the part of each holder of a licence in its 
provision of airport operation services at the airport to which the licence relates;
   --      the need to secure that each holder of a licence is able to take reasonable measures to reduce, 
control or mitigate the adverse environmental effects of the airport to which the licence relates, 
facilities used or intended to be used in connection with that airport and aircraft using that airport;
    --      any guidance issued to the CAA by the Secretary of State for Transport;
   --      any international obligation of the United Kingdom notified to the CAA by the Secretary of 
State for Transport; and
Esken Limited Proposed Firm Placing and Open -19-
   --      the principles that regulatory activities should be carried out in a way which is transparent, 
accountable, proportionate and consistent, and that regulatory activities should be targeted only at cases 
in which action is needed.
   As part of the aerodrome licencing regime, an airport operator must demonstrate that it is competent to 
conduct aerodrome operations safely. The CAA must grant a licence in respect of any aerodrome in the 
United Kingdom if it is satisfied that:
   --      the applicant is competent, having regard to its previous conduct and experience, equipment, 
organisation, staffing, maintenance and other arrangements, to secure that the aerodrome and the airspace 
within which its visual traffic pattern is normally contained are safe for use by aircraft; and
   --      the aerodrome is safe for use by aircraft, having regard in particular to the physical 
characteristics of the aerodrome and of its surroundings.
   Carlisle Lake District Airport maintains a CAA aerodrome licence, whereas London Southend Airport has 
transitioned from a CAA aerodrome licence to a certificate issued in accordance with the European Aviation 
Safety Agency's ("EASA") regime. Under the EASA regime, the CAA is still the primary regulatory point of 
contact for London Southend Airport, and it remains the CAA's responsibility to conduct audits of the 
airport in its capacity as a National Aviation Authority. However, EASA may conduct audits of the CAA (and 
other National Aviation Authorities) to ensure standardisation across member states. Following the end of 
the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020, the United Kingdom no longer participates in the EASA 
regime and the Group anticipates that London Southend Airport will transition back to a CAA aerodrome 
licence.
   Environment
   Rapid airport growth often raises concerns in neighbouring communities about aspects of environmental 
impact. Although it can be difficult to address all community concerns whilst continuing to grow, the 
Directors consider that London Southend Airport has always complied in full with all of the requirements 
placed upon it by its planning authorities.
   Aircraft noise in and around UK airports is subject to UK and local regulation. The UK Government has a 
key role in setting and developing the policy framework for aircraft noise control at UK airports, 
although individual procedures are generally agreed with local planning authorities. A range of noise 
controls relating to aircraft operations are set out in statutory notices and published in the UK 
Aeronautical Information Package and elsewhere as appropriate. These controls cover aspects such as 
departure noise limits and night flight restrictions. Additional noise-related controls are a feature of 
the local planning system that often introduces planning obligations in Section 106 agreements between 
airport operators and planning authorities.
   Stobart Aviation's airports are also subject to or influenced by various regulations and legislation 
designed to improve air quality and reduce carbon emissions. These include global agreements binding the 
United Kingdom to reduce its carbon emissions and UK regulations setting minimum standards for local air 
quality and limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides (whether from airport or other activities).
   Since 2016, the Group has operated a 3.2 hectare solar farm at London Southend Airport with the 
objective of reducing its carbon footprint and electricity requirement from the National Grid network. 
Over 20 per cent. of London Southend Airport's electricity comes from renewable sources.
    1.   Stobart Energy
   The Directors believe that the Group is the United Kingdom's largest supplier of waste wood fuel to UK 
biomass energy plants, with long-term exclusive contracts in place with some of the largest biomass energy 
plants in the United Kingdom. The Group has contracts in place to supply 1.7 million tonnes of waste wood 
fuel and in FY21 supplied 1.4 million tonnes.
   Biomass energy (including waste wood fuel) is generated using plant-based products, including wood 
pellets and wood chips, bioenergy crops and agricultural and domestic waste. The plant-based products are 
processed to create a low-carbon, renewable alternative to fossil fuels. Bioenergy (including waste wood 
fuel) is Britain's second largest source of renewable electricity (according to UK Department for 
Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy statistics), and the UK Committee on Climate Change has stated that 
sustainably sourced bioenergy could provide up to 15 per cent. of the United Kingdom's primary energy by 
2050.
   The Group offers a range of solutions across the biomass energy supply chain, from commercial waste 
collection through to producing fuel to a specification and delivering fuel to biomass energy plants using 
its large logistics function. The Group has expertise in waste wood, virgin wood, refuse derived fuel 
("RDF") and solid recovered fuel ("SRF"). Stobart Energy employs approximately 320 people, operates 145 
walking floor vehicles and operates six large fuel production and storage facilities, with a significant 
number of other fuel production and storage sites contracted to third parties to operate. The Group 
supplies more than 15 large, and a significant number of smaller, biomass energy plants in the United 
Kingdom and Ireland.
   The following table sets forth Stobart Energy's actual tonnage of waste wood fuel supplied, revenue, 
profit before tax from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated.

  Ryanair Holdings Group CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
   " COVID-19:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
   Covid-19 continued to wreak havoc on our business during Q1 with most Easter flights cancelled and a 
slower than expected easing of EU Govt. travel restrictions into May and June.  Significant uncertainty 
around travel green lists (particularly in the UK) and extreme Govt. caution in Ireland meant that Q1 
bookings were close-in and at low fares.  We kept aircraft and crews current throughout the quarter and 
recruited additional cabin crew to enable us recover quickly in Q2 as Covid restrictions ease.  The 1(st) 
July rollout of EU Digital Covid Certificates ("DCC") and the scrapping of quarantine for vaccinated 
arrivals to the UK from mid-July has seen a surge in bookings over recent weeks.  Pricing remains below 
pre Covid-19 levels and there will continue to be great value for Ryanair guests travelling this summer as 
we focus on recovering traffic, jobs and tourism across our European network.  Based on current (close-in) 
bookings, we expect traffic to rise from over 5m in June to almost 9m in July, and over 10m in Aug., as 
long as there are no further Covid setbacks in Europe.  We will continue our load active/yield passive 
strategy as we recover load factors over the course of FY22.
   The Covid-19 crisis has triggered the collapse of many European airlines including Flybe, Norwegian, 
Germanwings, Level and Stobart and led to substantial capacity cuts at many others including Alitalia, 
TAP, LOT, SAS, etc. The tsunami of State Aid from EU Govts. to their insolvent flag carriers (Alitalia, 
AirFrance/KLM, LOT, Lufthansa, SAS, TAP and others) will distort EU competition and prop up high cost, 
inefficient, flag carriers for many years.  We expect intra-European capacity to be materially lower for 
the foreseeable future.  This will create growth opportunities for Ryanair to extend airport incentives, 
as the Group takes delivery of 210 new Boeing 737 "Gamechanger" aircraft.  We are encouraged by the high 
rate of vaccinations across Europe.  If, as is presently predicted, most of Europe's adult population is 
fully vaccinated by Sept., then we believe that we can look forward to a strong recovery in air travel for 
the second half of the fiscal year and well into S.22 - as is presently the case in domestic US air 
travel.
   THE ENVIRONMENT & CUSTOMER SERVICE:
   Ryanair has repeatedly shown we can grow traffic while reducing our impact on the environment.  Every 
passenger that switches to Ryanair from Europe's legacy airlines reduces their CO emissions by almost 50% 
per flight. Over the next 5-years our traffic will grow to 200m p.a.  This will be achieved on a fleet 
that balances the demand for low fares with the need for sustainable flying.  Our new B737-8200 
"Gamechanger" aircraft (a $22bn+ investment) offers 4% more seats, but delivers 16% lower fuel burn and 
40% lower noise emissions, helps to meaningfully lower Ryanair's CO and noise footprint over the next 
decade.
   We continue to work actively with the EU, fuel suppliers and aircraft manufacturers to incentivise 
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use.  We are working with A4E and the EU Commission to accelerate reform 
to the Single European Sky, to minimise ATC delays and lower fuel consumption and CO emissions.  Last year 
Ryanair received an industry leading "B-" climate protection rating from CDP [1] , and we are working to 
improve this to an "A" rating over the next 2 years.  In April, Ryanair established a Sustainable Aviation 
Research Centre partnership with Trinity College Dublin to accelerate the development of SAFs.  Ryanair's 
goal is to power 12.5% of our flights with SAF by 2030 (well ahead of the 5% recently mandated by the EU 
Fit for 55 Proposals).  Earlier this month we launched a new carbon calculator enabling customers to 
(voluntarily) offset their carbon footprint on every Ryanair flight that they book.  These initiatives 
will help Ryanair achieve our target of lowering CO per passenger/km by 10% to just 60 grams by 2030.
   In July, Ryanair announced a 7 member Customer Advisory Panel.  Following over 10,000 applications from 
across 16 countries, the final panel represents a diverse cross-section of Ryanair customers (with members 
from Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain and the UK).  We will welcome this Panel to Dublin in Sept. 
for our first Customer Advisory meeting, with future meetings to take place in other major European 
cities.   The advice and input from the Panel will help shape Ryanair's continuing customer improvements 
programme, re-enforcing our commitment to delivering the lowest fares, on-time flights and a great 
customer experience as the Group returns to strong post Covid growth.
   Q1 FY22 BUSINESS REVIEW:
   Revenue & Costs
   Q1 scheduled revenue increased 91% to EUR192m due to a rise in traffic from 0.5m to 8.1m (at a 73% load 
factor). While traffic recovered significantly (compared to PY Q1), the cancellation of Easter traffic and 
the delayed relaxation of Govt. travel restrictions across the EU into May and June required significant 
price stimulation. Ancillary revenue performed well, generating approx. EUR22 per passenger, as more 
guests choose priority boarding and reserved seating.  As a result, total revenue increased by almost 200% 
to over EUR370m in Q1.  A sevenfold increase in sectors saw operating costs increase 116% to EUR675m, 
driven primarily by variable costs such as fuel, airport & handling and route charges.  The Group's fuel 
requirements are just under 60% hedged for FY22 at $565 per metric tonne and approx. 35% hedged for FY23 
at $600.  Carbon credits are fully hedged for FY22 and approx. 35% hedged for FY23 at under EUR24 per EUA 
(compared to forward rates of over EUR50).
   During Q1 our Route Development team continued their work with airport partners across Europe, and have 
negotiated lower airport costs, recovery incentives and the extension of many low cost airport growth 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
deals.  In addition to previously announced deals (with Billund, Riga, Stockholm, Zadar & Zagreb) and long 
term extensions of low-cost growth deals in London Stansted (to 2028), Milan Bergamo (to 2028) and 
Brussels Charleroi (to 2030), the Group has doubled its capacity in Rome (Fiumicino), added new routes to 
Helsinki and will launch new bases in Turin (Italy) and Agadir (Morocco) this winter.
   In June Ryanair took delivery of our first 3 B737-8200 "Gamechanger" aircraft from our 210 orderbook.  
The Gamechangers have 4% more seats, 16% lower fuel burn and 40% lower noise emissions and will, we 
believe, further widen the cost gap between Ryanair and all other European airlines for the next decade.  
While it is early days (and load factors have not yet recovered to pre Covid levels) we are very pleased 
with the operational performance and lower fuel burn recorded on these aircraft.  The feedback from our 
guests is resoundingly positive as they enjoy the extra leg room and 40% less noise.  We hope to increase 
our fleet of Gamechangers to over 60 in advance of S.22 and these new aircraft will drive our traffic 
growth to 200m p.a. by FY26.
   Balance Sheet & Liquidity
   Ryanair's balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry with a BBB credit rating (S&P and 
Fitch), EUR4.06bn cash and almost 90% of our B737 fleet unencumbered at quarter end. In May Ryanair issued 
a EUR1.2bn 5-year, unsecured, bond at a record low coupon of 0.875%.  In June the Group repaid its 
maturing EUR850m (2014) 1.875% bond.  Strong operating cashflows and supplier reimbursements drove a 
EUR0.62bn reduction in net debt to EUR1.66bn at 30 June (31 March: EUR2.28bn).  This balance sheet 
strength enables the Group to capitalise on the many growth opportunities that will be available in Europe 
in the post Covid-19 recovery.

   FY22 continues to be challenging, with Covid-19 travel restrictions prolonging uncertainty.  Following the 1(st) 
July rollout of EU DCC's (and the relaxation of the UK's quarantine rules) for fully vaccinated persons, our Group 
has seen Q2 bookings recover strongly (albeit at low fares).  With the booking curve remaining very close-in and 
fares well below pre Covid-19 levels, visibility for the remainder of FY22 is close to zero.  It therefore remains 
impossible to provide meaningful FY22 guidance at this time.  We believe that FY22 traffic has improved to a range 
of 90m to 100m (previously guided at the lower end of an 80m to 120m passenger range) and (cautiously) expect 
that the likely outcome for FY22 is somewhere between a small loss and breakeven.  This is dependent on the 
continued rollout of vaccines this summer, and no adverse Covid variant developments.
   As we look beyond the Covid-19 recovery, and the successful completion of vaccination rollouts, the Ryanair 
Group expects to have a materially lower cost base, a very strong balance sheet and industry leading traffic 
recovery.  Our new B737 "Gamechanger" aircraft will reduce fleet costs and unit costs (thanks to its attractive 
pricing, higher seat density and 16% lower fuel burn) for the next decade.  They will enhance revenue opportunities 
with 4% more seats, enabling the Group to fund lower fares and capitalise on the many growth opportunities that 
are now available across Europe, especially where competitor airlines have substantially cut capacity or failed. We 
are seeing a strong rebound of pent up travel demand into Aug. & Sept. and we expect this to continue into the 
second half of FY22, with pre Covid-19 growth planned to resume strongly in summer 2022."

  Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   MD&A Quarter Ended June 30, 2021
   Introduction
   The Ryanair Group's fleet was effectively grounded due to European Governments travel restrictions/ 
lockdowns during the prior year comparative (quarter ended June 30, 2020).  Sectors (up sevenfold) and 
traffic (+7.6M) are therefore significantly higher in the quarter ended June 30, 2021 (although still 
below pre Covid-19 levels) and the following discussion should be read in that context.
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues increased 91% to EUR192M due to a 7.6M increase in traffic, from 0.5M to 8.1M. While 
traffic increased significantly, the cancellation of most Easter flights and the delayed relaxation of 
Government travel restrictions across the EU and the UK into May and June meant that fares required 
significant price stimulation.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues increased to EUR179M due to a 7.6M rebound in traffic and a solid performance in 
priority boarding and reserved seating.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues increased 196% to EUR371M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation was flat at EUR134M primarily due to the sale of 7 older B737 aircraft and 11 B737 lease 
handbacks over the past year, offset by the delivery of 3 B737-8200 ("Gamechanger") aircraft in June and 
increased amortisation as schedules and cycles increased.
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil increased by EUR148M to EUR157M due to a sevenfold increase in sectors flown.
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs increased by EUR43M to EUR111M due to significantly higher sectors.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges rose by EUR69M to EUR87M due to increased sectors and passengers, offset 
by reduced charges.
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by EUR26M to EUR62M due to higher aircraft utilisation.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other increased by EUR30M to EUR72M due to higher activity and reduced 
discretionary spending across the Group.
   Route charges:
   Route charges increased by EUR50M to EUR52M due to significantly higher sectors.
   Aircraft rentals:
   Aircraft rentals dropped to zero due to no longer having B737 aircraft on lease.
   Other expense:
   The absence of hedge ineffectiveness in the quarter was offset by a EUR12M increase in finance expenses 
due to higher gross debt and negative average interest rates on euro deposits.
   Balance sheet
   Gross cash increased by EUR906M to EUR4,056M at June 30, 2021.
   Gross debt increased by EUR291M to EUR5,718M, primarily due to a EUR1,200M Eurobond issuance in May 
2021 offset by a EUR850M (2014) Eurobond maturity repayment in June 2021 in addition to EUR61M secured 
debt and lease liability payments in the quarter.
   Net debt was EUR1,661M at June 30, 2021. This is a EUR615M reduction from EUR2,277M at March 31, 2021.
   Shareholders' equity:
   Shareholders' equity decreased by EUR177M to EUR4,469M in the quarter primarily due to a EUR273M net 
loss.

consolidated Interim financial statements of the Company for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 comprise the

condensed 
consolidated 
Interim

statements 
("the

statements was unqualified.

   Statement of Cash Flows restatement
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
   Operating cash inflows and investing cash outflows for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 have been 
reclassified. They both have been reduced by approximately EUR103M to address accrued supplier payables 
which had previously been presented as a capital expenditure cash outflow in investing activities and as a 
movement in working capital in operating activities. As no actual cash flows arose and the payable is not 
working capital related, both line items required adjustments. There is no impact on the Group's net cash 
flows, consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income and basic and diluted earnings per share for the 
quarter ended.
    2.            Judgements and estimates
   The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
   In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the most recent published 
consolidated financial statements.
   Derivative financial instruments
   The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, 
including the risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates. Ryanair uses 
forward contracts for the purchase of its jet fuel requirements to reduce its exposure to commodity price 
risk. It also uses foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to risks related to foreign 
currencies, principally the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the purchase of new Boeing 737-8200 
aircraft and the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the purchase of jet fuel.
   The Group recognises all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in its consolidated 
balance sheet and measures them at fair value.
    3.            Seasonality of operations
   The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
    4.            Income tax expense
   The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 
2021 was a credit of 16.0% (June 30, 2020: 11.9%). The Group's accounting tax credit for the quarter ended 
June 30, 2021 of approximately EUR52M (June 30, 2020: EUR25M); comprising of a deferred tax credit of 
EUR56M primarily relating to net operating losses and the temporary differences for property, plant and 
equipment, offset by a Group current tax charge of approximately EUR4M.
    5.            Share based payments
   The terms and conditions of the Group's share-based remuneration programmes are disclosed in the most 
recent, published, consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR2.4M in the quarter ended June 30, 
2021 (June 30, 2020: EUR1.0M) is the fair value of share options granted in prior periods and a 
conditional share grant under LTIP 2019, in the current quarter, to over 80 managers across the Group (the 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors were not included in this LTIP 2019 grant). The charge is recognised 
within the income statement in accordance with employee services rendered. During the quarter ended June 
30, 2021, 0.5M ordinary shares were issued at strike prices between EUR6.25 and EUR6.74 per share 
following the exercise of vested share options.
    6.            Contingencies
   The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
    7.            Capital commitments
   As of June 30, 2021, the Ryanair Group had a fleet of 422 owned Boeing 737s, including 3 "Gamechanger" 
B737-8200s. In addition, the Group had 29 leased Airbus A320 aircraft. In September 2014, the Group agreed 
to purchase up to 200 (100 firm and 100 options) Boeing 737-8200 aircraft, subsequently increased to 210 
(135 firm and 75 options). In December 2020, the Group increased its firm orders from 135 to 210 Boeing 
737-8200 aircraft and in June 2021, the Group took delivery of the first of these aircraft. The remaining 
aircraft are due to deliver before the end of fiscal year 2025.
    8.            Analysis of operating segment
   The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the Group CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).
   The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the profit/(loss) after tax of each airline 
for the reporting period. Resource allocation decisions for all airlines are based on airline performance 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
for the relevant period, with the objective in making these resource allocation decisions being to 
optimize consolidated financial results.
   Ryanair DAC and Malta Air are reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. Buzz and Lauda do

to protect jobs within the Group. These schemes were a mix of short term Covid-19 specific programmes and 
long term schemes linked to social security that existed pre Covid-19. The total amount of payroll 
supports received by the Group under the various schemes amounted to approximately EUR22M and are offset 
against staff costs in the Consolidated Income Statement.
   In April 2020, the Group raised GBP600M unsecured debt for general corporate purposes under the HMT and 
Bank of England CCFF. The 0.44% interest rate was the prevailing rate for strong BBB rated companies . 
This debt was subsequently extended in March 2021 for a further 12 months at a 0.46% interest rate.
   There are no unfulfilled conditions attaching to government assistance at June 30, 2021.
    15.        Post balance sheet events
   There were no significant post balance sheet events.
    16.          Going concern
   The Board are satisfied that it remains appropriate to adopt the going concern concept. In arriving at 
this decision, the Board considered, among other things:
   1.    The Ryanair Group's liquidity with over EUR4bn cash at June 30, 2021, a EUR0.62bn reduction in 
net debt in the quarter and the Group's continued focus on cash management;
    2.    The Group's solid BBB credit ratings (from both S&P and Fitch Ratings);
    3.    The Group's strong balance sheet with almost 90% of its B737 fleet unencumbered;
   4.    The Group's access to the debt capital markets. In May 2021, the Group raised a EUR1.2bn, 5 year 
unsecured Eurobond at a low coupon of 0.875%;
    5.    Ongoing cost reductions across the Group;
   6.    The widespread rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in Europe, with it reported that the vast majority of 
the European adult population will be vaccinated before the end of September 2021;
    7.    Increased bookings; and
   8.    The Group's flexibility to react quickly to improved customer demand following vaccine rollouts, 
the launch of EU Digital Covid Certificates, the relaxation of quarantine requirements for vaccinated 
arrivals to the UK from mid-July, and the (expected) further easing of European Governments travel 
restrictions/lockdowns over the coming months.

   Net capital additions for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 amounted to EUR157M, principally reflecting 
aircraft pre-delivery deposits, and 3 aircraft deliveries offset by supplier reimbursements of EUR114M.
    11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
   The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
   These Interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2020 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the period.
   Fair value hierarchy
   Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
   --    Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
the Group can access at the measurement date.
   --    Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    --    Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
   Fair value estimation
   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
   Financial instruments measured at fair value
   --     Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
   --     Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and EUA contracts: A comparison of the 
contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at June 30, 2021 has 
been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
   The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the quarter ended June 30, 2021, there 
were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
   Financial instruments not measured at fair value
   --     Long-term debt: The repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at the 
relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at June 30, 2021 to arrive at a 
fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
   While there have been significant changes in business and economic circumstances during the quarter 
ended June 30, 2021, the future outlook for the business is such that there has been no material change to 
the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities.
   The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.

(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who

   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;

Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].

presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

  Strategy and Business Review
   Culture, Purpose & Value
   The Directors have considered the culture, purpose and values of Artemis Alpha Trust plc ("the 
Company"). By undergoing this exercise, the Directors seek to ensure that these three elements help drive 
forward the strategy.
   Culture
   The Company is an externally managed investment trust and as such its culture is created by the Board 
of Directors and the Manager, Artemis Fund Managers Limited.
   Purpose
   Our purpose is to provide our shareholders, large or small, with a diversified and cost-effective 
investment opportunity to achieve long-term growth.
   Values
   The Company provides access to a portfolio of investments which the Board expects to be managed with 
integrity, transparency and accountability and  with  appropriate due diligence to environmental, social 
and governance matters. The constructive and openly discursive nature of the relationship between the 
Board and the Manager helps ensure their respective values are aligned and focused on delivering the 
strategy for our shareholders.
   The core values that contribute to the Board culture include:
   --      Integrity: the Board seeks to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, both to the 
letter and in spirit.
   --      Accountability: the Board recognises the need to explain the Company's performance to investors 
and to highlight the risks in a clear and open manner. The Board has a key role to encourage and challenge 
the performance of its Manager and its other service providers to help ensure the Company continues to 
provide shareholder value.
   --      Respect & Transparency: the Board seeks to communicate clearly and openly with shareholders and 
service providers respecting individual opinions and expectations. Contact by shareholders via the 
Chairman's email address is welcomed.
   --      Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") issues: We are stewards of our shareholders' 
capital; both the Board and Manager recognise that this comes with responsibilities. ESG considerations 
are integrated within the investment process.
   An overview of the Manager's culture, values and stewardship activities can be found on the website at 
www.artemisfunds.com.
   Corporate strategy & policy
   The Company is incorporated in England as a public company limited by shares. Its business as an 
investment trust is to buy and sell investments with the aim of achieving the objective and in accordance 
with the policy set out in the Annual Financial Report.
   Gearing
   The Company uses gearing (i.e borrowing) as part of its investment strategy. The Company's Articles  of 
Association  limit  borrowing to 50 per cent of the Company's net assets. However, the investment policy 
limits this to 25 per cent of net assets. Subject to this being complied with, the level of borrowing is a 
matter for the Board, whilst the utilisation of borrowings is delegated to the Investment Manager. This 
utilisation may be subject to specific guidelines established by the Board from time to time. The current 
guidelines permit the Investment Manager to employ borrowings of up to 20 per cent of net assets. During 
the prior year, the Company's borrowing facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc ended. The use of 
Artemis Alpha Trust PLC Annual Financial Report -4-
gearing by the Investment Manager will vary from time to time, reflecting its views on the potential 
returns from stock markets. The Company's gearing is reviewed by the Board and Investment Manager on an 
ongoing basis. At the year end, net gearing was 10.2 per cent.
   Leverage
   Leverage is defined in the Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive ("AIFMD") as any method by 
which the Company can increase its exposure by borrowing cash or securities, or from leverage that is 
embedded in derivative positions. The Company has entered into an agreement with JP Morgan to utilise 
contracts for difference as a form of leverage. A result of 100 per cent indicates that no leverage has 
been used. The Company is permitted by its Articles to borrow up to 50 per cent; however the Company's 
investment policy restricts this to 25 per cent. The Company is permitted to have additional leverage of 
up to 100 per cent of its net assets, which results in permitted total leverage of 225 per cent under both 
ratios. Artemis as the Alternative Investment Fund Manager ("AIFM"), monitors leverage limits on a daily 
basis and reviews them annually. No changes have been made to these limits during the period. At 30 April 
2021, the Company's leverage was 122.7 per cent as determined using the gross method and 110.6 per cent 
under the commitment method.
   The Investment Manager requires prior Board approval to:
    (i)               enter into any stocklending agreements;
    (ii)               to borrow money against the security of the Company's investments; or
    (iii)              create any charges over any of the Company's investments.
   Operating environment
   The Company operates as an investment trust company and is an investment company within the meaning of 
section 833 of the Companies Act 2006 (the "Act").
   The Company has been approved as an investment trust in accordance with the requirements of section 
1158 of the Corporation Taxes Act 2010 which remains subject to the Company continuing to meet the 
eligibility conditions and ongoing requirements of the regulations. The Board will manage the Company so 
as to continue to meet these conditions.
   The Company has no employees and delegates most of its operational functions to service providers.
   Current & future developments
   A summary of the Company's developments during the year ended 30 April 2021, together with its 
prospects for the future, is set out in the Chairman's Statement and Investment Manager's Review included 
in the Annual Financial Report. The Board's principal focus is the delivery of positive long-term returns 
for shareholders and this will be dependent on the success of the investment strategy. The investment 
strategy, and factors that may have an influence on it, such as economic and stock market conditions, are 
discussed regularly by the Board and the Investment Manager. The Board regularly considers the ongoing 
development and strategic direction of the Company, including its promotion and the effectiveness of 
communication with shareholders.

   The last factor that has boosted the weight of Rapid Growth holdings has been share price performance, which 
we referenced above. Such significant gains, even when accompanied by fast revenue growth, do lead us to 
consider the balance of the portfolio and since early 2020 we have been looking to identify a more diverse set of 
exposures. These include the purchase of high-quality Stalwart companies which we had admired for a long time 
and where the pandemic sell-off provided an entry point. They are household names in adidas (branded 
sportswear), Estée Lauder (cosmetics) and S&P Global Inc (formerly Standard and Poors, a financial ratings 
agency).
   After a crisis, capital gets withdrawn from certain industries so we have sought out companies that can improve 
their market positions and emerge stronger. These include Lyft (ride sharing), Bookings Holdings (the dominant 
online travel agent), Rio Tinto (mining), and Wizz Air (a low-cost airline mainly operating in Eastern Europe). We 
have also added to Ryanair which the portfolio has owned for many years and will benefit from a further 
retrenchment of its competitors.
   The complete sales in the portfolio have made way for many of the stocks mentioned above. As well as selling 
Kirby and Orica with commodity exposure we also sold MRC Global and DistributionNOW (both suppliers to the 
energy industry), and Ferro-Alloy Resources (a Vanadium miner). We sold GrubHub and Just Eat Takeaway as we 
have settled on Doordash being the potential winner in food delivery. Sales also include companies whose shares 
have done well and are now more expensive in the context of their fundamentals such as earnings per share - 
Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Waters (scientific instruments).
   Governance and Sustainability
   The Chairman has referred to this important area. Our wider team has a dedicated Governance and Sustainability 
(G&S) analyst, and Baillie Gifford's broader research department has over twenty full time G&S personnel 
dedicated to engagement, research, and proxy voting. Our starting point is that we only buy companies that we feel 
have strong foundations and will need nudging towards even better standards rather than frequent or public 
criticism. We think it achieves more in the long term to tend to be a supportive shareholder, so we don't start with 
bad companies and plan to make them better.
Monks Investment Trust PLC Annual Financial -4-
   We want to back and encourage ambition amongst the companies that we own for you. This requires 
understanding of an individual company and the patience to engage. We get good access to management by being 
a supportive long-term holder who can hold significant stakes in companies. This access brings engagement, which 
in turn helps us encourage behaviours that support all stakeholders in a business. Just as we invest for the long 
term, we encourage the investee companies to do the same. We are prepared to be tough with companies and their 
management teams, continuing to own and engage rather than sell because they do not fit a narrow quantitative 
model which purports to measure Environmental, Social and Governance factors precisely.
   If corporate behaviour is not progressive, we will sell but only after engagement has been fulsome and clear. We 
have done this over the last 12-18 months with Jefferies Financial Group (formerly Leucadia) which we have 
ultimately sold. When we bought the company in 2015, we felt we had identified an investment bank with a 
management team which was much better aligned than the average in that industry. For example, by 2020 the CEO 
(Rich Handler) and President (Brian Friedman) had a combined 9% ownership and have never sold a share other 
than for charity purposes. During our ownership Jefferies had re-organised itself from a holding company into a 
purer-play investment bank. This generated value but the banking business was subject to rising costs 
(compensation) as the M&A cycle extended.
   One of our five core ESG beliefs is 'Long-term focused remuneration with stretching targets [2] '. When the 
remuneration committee saw fit to pay management cash bonuses despite missing a key target for ROE, we 
engaged with the committee chairperson. This call demonstrated a lack of independence, and when challenged it 
became apparent that the cash awards were partly to help the executives pay tax bills for unvested share awards. 
We opposed the re-election of the chairperson, and the compensation plan. The latter was 31% opposed and we 
sold the shares after the post pandemic recovery. Overall, Jefferies has not been a good investment and it shows 
the importance of corporate culture to the success of a business.
   A more encouraging engagement took place during the year with Service Corp International. As America's largest 
chain of undertakers, it was very much on the front line during the pandemic. This is a company we are still getting 
to know, having purchased it in 2018. Since then we have been engaging with the company and have good 
progress to report. We spoke to the CEO and CFO about changes to the proxy statement and the operational 
impact of Covid-19.
   In 2019, we requested greater board refreshment and changes to executive remuneration. The company has 
made progress on both fronts. Average director tenure has fallen from 24 to 16 years. A balance is being struck 
between fresh challenge and deep domain expertise. With regards to pay, we are delighted that they have 
introduced customer satisfaction metrics into the short-term remuneration plan and an above midcap-average 
return on equity trigger to the long-term incentive plan (LTIP). There remains more to go with the LTIP and we have 
asked for further recommendations to be put to the compensation committee.
   The discussion during the pandemic revealed the extraordinary steps Service Corp has taken in the fight against 
Covid-19. For example, it suspended all planned price increases, wishing to do right by society rather than pursue 
profit maximisation. We fully support this policy. Many industry participants are small, independent undertakers who 
are struggling to adapt - in some cases they 'stopped answering the phone'. Service Corp has stepped in, deploying 
assets and people to areas most in need. This conversation left us increasingly impressed at the culture of the 
organisation and the management team's care of staff, the communities they serve and the long-term sustainability 
of the business.
   Further examples of our engagement with companies can be seen in the Monks Stewardship Report 2020, which 
is available on the Company's page of the Baillie Gifford's website, under 'Documents' and 'Investment Intelligence'.
   Management Team
   In May 2020, we announced that Charles Plowden would retire from Baillie Gifford at the end of April 2021 which 
coincided with the Monks year end. Charles has been a fount of wisdom and wit for nearly four decades while at 
Baillie Gifford and was instrumental in the Monks portfolio changes since 2015 which have driven excellent returns 
and healthy demand for Monks shares. We are grateful for the many insights he has shared with us since we 
started working together on the Global Alpha team in 2005. Above all, he has made sure that we can sustain his 
legacy by leaving in place a team of diverse thinkers for the management of Monks Investment Trust.
   In anticipation of Charles' retirement, we have strengthened the team which supports the managers. That team 
was five people when we took on responsibility for Monks in 2015, and today it is seven. The new investment 
manager, Spencer Adair, has 21 years' experience. Deputy manager, Malcolm MacColl, has 22 years' experience 
and both have worked together as Monk's deputies for six years.

   Outlook
   We look forward not backwards, we expect change not stasis. It is understandable that many are alighting on the 
post-pandemic phase as a turning point for stock markets but we think it more likely that it accelerates the trends 
we are backing through careful stock selection. We are growth investors, we concede we have enjoyed a tailwind in 
the last few years but we also feel strongly that ambitious companies will continue to drive stock market returns and 
our focus should be on identifying those that have that potential.
   Each year we write the Monks Research Agenda, which shapes how we approach certain aspects of our 
research. Whilst bottom-up stock picking dominates our approach, the agenda can lead us on journeys that help us 
find the stocks that will generate long-term returns. This year we are continuing to focus on new areas that 
technology has not yet touched - healthcare, education, real estate and energy. We are also thinking of the next 
stage of development of online services; we referred to this above in our comments about the cloud being one of 
the most significant evolutions of the last forty years. We continue to look at ensuring companies do the right thing 
by society and trying to understand the implications of the great energy transition as solar and wind energy 
potentially drive energy costs down while at the same time allowing entities around the world to reach carbon 
neutral or zero carbon targets.
   Whilst these trends may endure for a decade or more, we remain pragmatic and opportunistic in shaping the 
portfolio around a range of growth companies that might prosper as cycles change. Above all, optimism is built into 
our DNA and we look forward to seeking the changes that can provide further profitable investments.

    RYANAIR TAKES DELIVERY OF 1(ST) BOEING 737 "GAMECHANGER" AIRCRAFT
   NEW FLEET CUTS FUEL BY 16%, REDUCES NOISE BY 40%
   Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 airline, today (Wed 16(th) June) took delivery of its first Boeing 737-8200 
"Gamechanger" aircraft in Seattle, Washington. The aircraft flew overnight from Seattle and will land in 
Dublin Airport later this afternoon. This is the first delivery of Ryanair's 210 firm order of these 
revolutionary "Gamechanger" aircraft, which is an investment in new technology, valued at over $22bn. 
These new aircraft will carry 4% more passengers but reduce fuel consumption by 16% per seat, lower noise 
emissions by 40% and lower CO2 emissions by a similar amount.
   Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
   "We are delighted to take delivery of our first new technology Gamchanger aircraft. These new Boeing 
737 aircraft will help Ryanair lower costs, cut fuel consumption and lower noise and CO2 emissions as we 
invest heavily in new technology to deepen our environmental commitment as Europe's greenest, cleanest 
major airline. Each B737 aircraft offers 197 seats (compared to our 189-seat current 737 fleet). However, 
our customers will enjoy more leg room, new Boeing "Sky Interiors" and lower fares, while reducing their 
environmental footprint by switching to these new aircraft.
   Due to regrettable delivery delays, we expect to take delivery of just 12 of these aircraft during 
Summer 2021, with 6 delivering in Ryanair colours and 6 in Malta Air colours.
   Ryanair expects to take delivery of an additional 50 of these B737 "Gamechanger" aircraft before Summer 
2022, which will enable the Ryanair Group to rebound strongly, offering new routes, lower fares, and rapid 
traffic recovery to many partner airports across Europe as the tourism industry rebuilds from the 
devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020/2021".

                                                   COVID-19 Risk
                                                    In the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts, we detailed 
how COVID-19
                                                    has impacted virtually every principal risk. Whilst 
the UK now
                                                    has an advanced vaccination programme and a roadmap 
for exiting
                                                    the COVID-19 lockdown, the pandemic will continue to 
have a
                                                    significant impact on the Group's principal risk types 
for the
                                                    remaining six months of the Company's financial year. 
We expect
                                                    consumer 
demand 
to 
be 
heavily 
affected 
given 
confusion, complexity
                                                    and additional costs caused by the traffic light 
system, government
                                                    advice and testing and quarantine requirements, which 
led to
                                                    the Group's announcement on 12 May 2021 to remove July 
and August
                                                    2021 holidays from sale until more clarity was 
available. We
                                                    expect further package organiser liability to arise in 
respect
                                                    of refunds for cancelled holidays as a result of the 
disruption.
                                                   Ryanair update
                                                    The Group is one of several online travel agents 
involved in
                                                    litigation with Ryanair in connection with Ryanair's 
efforts
                                                    to prevent online travel agents (OTAs) from booking 
its flights.
                                                    The legal process is ongoing but remains at an early 
stage.
                                                    The case was issued in 2010 and has been dormant for 
over three
                                                    years, with the next step being for Ryanair to apply 
to court
                                                    to enter a new statement of claim. In June 2021, the 
Group issued
                                                    a motion to have the claim dismissed for inordinate 
and inexcusable
                                                    delay 
on 
the 
part 
of 
Ryanair. 
Litigation 
is 
unpredictable and
                                                    if Ryanair were to prevail in this litigation, this 
could have
                                                    a material impact on the Group's business.
On the Beach Group PLC INTERIM RESULTS -7-
                                                   Since 
the 
pandemic 
started, 
there 
has 
been 
an 
escalation in
                                                    Ryanair's aggression towards OTAs, including On the 
Beach. For
                                                    example, Ryanair has (i) delayed and withheld refunds 
for cancelled
                                                    flights; (ii) published statements and videos making 
serious
                                                    allegations regarding OTAs; (iii) attempted to block 
OTA bookings;
                                                    and 
(iv) 
recently 
started 
to 
use 
increasingly 
aggressive tactics
                                                    to degrade the experience for customers of OTAs. The 
Group is
                                                    in correspondence with Ryanair on this matter and will 
pursue
                                                    legal action if necessary. The Group continues to 
invest in
                                                    its proprietary technology and its talented people to 
optimise
                                                    its offering for its customers.
                                            2.4   Going concern
                                                        On the Beach Group covers its daily working 
capital requirements
                                                         by means of cash and a Revolving Credit Facility 
("RCF").
                                                        As at 31 March 2021 cash, excluding cash held in 
trust, was
                                                         GBP30.0m (31 March 2020 cash of GBP17.0m, 30 
September 2020
                                                         cash of GBP36.5m).
                                                        The Group has a low fixed cost base, no inventory 
commitments,
                                                         is cash positive, has access to an undrawn 
facility and operates
                                                         a 
trust 
account 
for 
customer 
prepayments. 
Therefore is well
                                                         positioned to continue to operate throughout the 
sustained disruption
                                                         caused by the pandemic.
                                                        The Group has taken further action to ensure it 
has sufficient
                                                         liquidity to operate through the pandemic and 
capitalise on
                                                         opportunities once travel restrictions are eased. 
This includes:
                                                          *    On 25 May 2021, covenant tests were amended 
up to and
                                                               including 30 September 2022 to account for 
the impact
                                                               of COVID-19 on the Group's results, tests 
return to
                                                               normal from 1 October 2022.
                                                         *    Exercised 1 year extension to the GBP25m RCF 
facility
                                                               under CLBILS which now expires in May 2023.
On the Beach Group PLC INTERIM RESULTS -7-
                                                   The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for a 
period
                                                    of 12 months from the date of approval of these 
financial statements.
                                                    The Directors have modelled a number of scenarios 
considering
                                                    factors such as airline and hotelier resilience, 
employee absence
                                                    and customer behaviour / demand. As part of this 
exercise, the
                                                    Directors modelled what they consider to be a severe 
downside
                                                    scenario of no travel or bookings until 2022. Even in 
this scenario,
                                                    the Group would have no requirement to draw down on 
its current
                                                    facilities.
                                                   Given the assumptions above, the Directors remain 
confident
                                                    in their response to the pandemic and will continue to 
operate
                                                    in an agile way adapting to any applicable government 
guidance.
                                                    Therefore it is considered appropriate to continue to 
adopt
                                                    the going concern basis in preparing these financial 
statements.

   CMA launches action against British Airways and Ryanair over refunds
   The CMA is investigating whether British Airways and Ryanair have broken consumer law by failing to 
offer refunds for flights customers could not legally take.
   The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has today opened enforcement cases into both firms and 
written to them detailing its concerns. The move comes after the CMA opened an investigation into the 
airlines sector in December 2020 following reports that consumers were being denied refunds for flights 
that they could not legally take.
   During periods of lockdown across the UK, British Airways and Ryanair refused to give refunds to people 
that were lawfully unable to fly, with British Airways offering vouchers or rebooking and Ryanair 
providing the option to rebook.
   The CMA is concerned that, by failing to offer people their money back, both firms may have breached 
consumer law and left people unfairly out of pocket. It is now seeking to resolve these concerns with the 
companies, which may include seeking refunds, or other redress, for affected customers.
   Andrea Coscelli, Chief Executive of the CMA, said:
   "While we understand that airlines have had a tough time during the pandemic, people should not be left 
unfairly out of pocket for following the law.
   "Customers booked these flights in good faith and were legally unable to take them due to circumstances 
entirely outside of their control. We believe these people should have been offered their money back."
   British Airways and Ryanair now have the opportunity to respond to the CMA's detailed concerns.
   For more information, visit the COVID-19: lockdown flight refunds page .
   Notes to editors
   1.   The firms included in the CMA's enforcement action are British Airways PLC, BA CityFlyer Ltd, and 
Ryanair DAC.
   2.   It should not be assumed at this stage that any of the airlines have breached the law. Ultimately, 
only a court can decide whether a breach has occurred.
   3.    Ryanair told us that they repaid a small number of people having reviewed the specifics of their 
cases.
Competition and Markets Authority CMA action against BA and Ryanair over refunds
   4.   The scope of the CMA's  investigation relates to periods when it was unlawful in one or more parts 
of the UK for people to travel for non-essential reasons. It covers flights that were not cancelled, and 
does not cover any other situations.
   5.   While the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) leads on consumer protection in the airline sector, the 
CMA has undertaken extensive action in connection with cancellations and refunds during the pandemic and 
is well placed to support the CAA on these issues. The CMA and the CAA also share the same enforcement 
powers to tackle breaches of consumer protection law.
   6.   As an enforcer under Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002, the CMA cannot levy administrative fines, 
but it can enforce consumer protection legislation through the courts, and where appropriate, require 
additional measures to improve consumer choice, drive better compliance with the law, or secure redress 
for consumers.
   7.   The CMA is unable to comment on individual circumstances, nor help resolve individual complaints.
   8.   All information available in relation to this case is on the COVID-19: lockdown flight refunds 
page .
    9.   For media queries, contact the CMA press office via press@cma.gov.uk or on 020 3738 6460.

   Hornby's resilient performance continued throughout the year and after good results in Q4, in which it outlined its 
return to profitability, it ended the year up 68%. Over the full year Ryanair, Dignity, Randall & Quilter and Vesuvius 
had positive share price performance with Frasers Group close behind, only losing 2%. Dignity's share price 
benefited after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) produced its provisional decision report into the 
funeral industry in August, which did not include remedies that could be detrimental to the industry.
   From a negative perspective, Lloyds, easyJet and JD Wetherspoon were among the holdings whose share prices 
suffered significant price falls over the whole year.
   In the first quarter of 2021 we sold our entire holding in Redrow because of an accumulation of factors. It is a 
company again in transition following the retirement of its founder, has made some missteps of late and has a 
landbank with some sites that take a very long time to develop. We expect continued changes in environmental and 
building regulations in the coming years which will increase the cost of building. Ultimately, that cost will fall on 
future land sellers but for an existing landbank, it falls on the housebuilder. We prefer the shorter and faster turning 
landbanks of Barratt and Bellway, which are less exposed to those risks.
   ACTIVITY REVIEW
   In the early months of 2020, as the extent of the pandemic became clear, our focus was on an assessment of all 
businesses in the portfolio to determine their ability to survive the likely slowdown. Having made an assessment 
that all our businesses would survive, our focus moved to identifying opportunities.
   In March, we deployed cash at circa 1/3rd of intrinsic value, with 200% upside. We bought Barratt Developments, 
Ryanair, easyJet and Lloyds. The most significant activity was a 5.5% increase in Barratt Developments in cost 
price weight terms, as we bought stock at GBP4 when our estimate of intrinsic value was GBP12. We could not 
come up with a realistic scenario where GBP4 was the right price. It represented an enormous margin of safety.
   In the 2nd and 3rd quarters activity, when measured in portfolio turnover, was extremely light. However, our work 
was ongoing, in a continual effort to ensure that our assessment that all our companies had the financial resource 
to withstand the major disruption brought about by COVID-19, was sound.
   At the end of June, we wrote the following in the Aurora monthly report and the sentiments still holds true:
Aurora Investment Trust PLC Final Results -4-
   We went into the downturn with a view that we had strong businesses with robust balance sheets that could 
withstand major interruptions to their operations. So far, everything that has happened has supported those 
assessments. Some of them have raised capital, R&Q for opportunistic reasons, JD Wetherspoons out of caution 
and easyJet to repair a balance sheet for the losses to equity from the lockdown. None of them had to and so none 
were done at distressed levels and we didn't participate in any. Stronger balance sheets protect us from worst case 
scenarios at the cost of diluting some of the upside.
   We also believe we have a portfolio of companies with competitive advantages and so as they emerge from 
lockdown, we see many opportunities to grow share. The above effects in retail mean that Frasers Group returns 
from lockdown to less competition, lower rents and eventually lower rates. The downturn has also given them 
opportunities to buy businesses at attractive prices. easyJet and Ryanair are poised to benefit from changes in air 
travel. Our polling during the downturn shows no loss of appetite for leisure travel, but there does seem likely to be 
less business travel, at least initially because of the alternative of video meetings and the economic recession. 
Significant amounts of capacity have been taken out of the commercial airline space in Europe, a number of 
marginal players have failed and those major players who have taken government support look hamstrung by the 
terms of that support. easyJet and Ryanair, already the no.1 and no.2 airlines in Europe and profitable lowest cost 
producers look set to gain share, fill the void, and satisfy the pent-up demand to travel that COVID-19 has not 
permanently damaged.
   As well as our work on existing holdings, we looked at many new investments during the year, but we placed 
great store in the knowledge we had built up in businesses and industries in which we were very familiar. For us to 
invest outside that area in a time of great uncertainty would have required a very high degree of confidence and 
significant return expectations. We determined that the probability of error in our assessments was high, therefore 
we passed. We did have one potential new investment which we missed as it traded just above our entry price, and 
we did begin to purchase a new holding, but the price moved away before we could build a meaningful position.
   As reported earlier, Q4 saw markets and our portfolio recover strongly with news of the high vaccine efficacy.
   In late 2020 and into the New Year we became concerned about the potential for higher inflation and the 
possibility of unexpected interest rate rises if higher inflation was not managed carefully by central banks. It is our 
belief that an unexpected series of interest rate rises could have a significant negative effect on equity values. Due 
to the ongoing pandemic, equity index protection remains expensive, therefore, we have investigated the use of 
options on short sterling futures as a means of effectively hedging at a reasonable cost. At the time of writing the 
hedge is not yet in place as the price moved during the time it took to determine the regulatory leverage treatment, 
but it is our intention to spend, at an appropriate price, no more than 1% of NAV, which would pay out circa. one-
third of the value of the portfolio if interest rates were 2% in September 2022. We would be buying protection, 
therefore the value at risk would be the money spent on the option and no more. Regulatory leverage calculations 
require us to report on the underlying nominal value when calculating leverage which can be much higher, but it 
bears no relationship to the actual risk of loss.
   In early January 2021, Gary Channon wrote to Aurora Shareholders in the December factsheet with his thoughts 
on the portfolio going into the New Year. Those sentiments hold true today:
   We enter 2021 with a portfolio of undervalued businesses that we believe are well positioned to capitalise on a 
competitive landscape that has been radically altered in some areas by failure and trend accelerations. Our upside 
to intrinsic value at circa. 100% does not properly reflect that potential because it is hard to estimate how it will play 
out, but the important thing is that its additive to value.
   For example, Ryanair and easyJet will be serving a demand for personal travel that looks undiminished and even 
enhanced by pandemic lockdowns and they will be doing it with fewer competitors and reduced capacity than those 
that are left.
   Wetherspoons will be serving a demand that, if anything, seems to have been increased by having it rationed and 
denied. It did not take much government encouragement in the summer to fill pubs and restaurants with casual 
diners, even with social distancing.
   Retailing has been ravaged not just by the business interruption that has impacted travel and hospitality but 
because the pandemic has accelerated the trend already underway to a different way of retailing. Whilst many 
companies in the sector have failed, Mike Ashley and his Frasers Group have been busy seizing the opportunities 
thrown up and have traded profitably throughout. They look well positioned to benefit from their omnichannel 
offering across sports and luxury as they relentlessly experiment and adapt to the changing consumer demand.

   Our cyclical domestic holdings in housebuilders and Lloyds Bank have hurt the portfolio this year. They have 
actually been less impacted by the downturn than might have been expected and we think are very well placed for 
2021. Again, the pandemic seems to have increased the demand for homes; more specifically there is a growing 
demand for more space and a move away from city centres of which our businesses are a beneficiary.
   The final grouping within the portfolio is those businesses where we are trying to increase their value through our 
involvement, our control and influence holdings. Hornby benefited from the lockdown whereas the others Dignity 
and Stanley Gibbons were negatively impacted to varying degrees. Dignity benefited from more funerals but as they 
were smaller affairs the average revenue and profitability declined. Overall, this group significantly lifted the portfolio 
return and Hornby was the main driver of that. A year ago, we told you of our plans to put all these holdings into a 
single company which would be separately listed. We paused that project during the pandemic because we didn't 
think it was the best use of our time. However, the work is all done and so we have recently resumed that process 
and will be bringing the new company to market, called The Castelnau Group, in the next few months.
   As a reminder of what we are trying to achieve, these are businesses that we believe can create considerably 
more value if they adopt different approaches. We have pulled together the wisdom and techniques we have 
learned from studying and closely monitoring some great businesses and businesspeople and we are beginning to 
apply those to these businesses. It is still early days, but our view of the potential has only grown the more we have 
done this and that is despite the fact that most of the time things don't seem to go to plan, are harder to implement 
than we expected and we are constantly hit by setbacks. It seems that our rate of progress is accelerating at the 
rate at which things don't go right and we learn from that.

Body
   The general risk analysis undertaken by the Board and its overall policy approach to risk management 
are set out in the Strategic Report. Issues associated with portfolio distribution and concentration risk 
are discussed in the Investment Policy section of the Strategic Report. This note, which is incorporated 
in accordance with accounting standard IFRS7, examines in greater detail the identification, measurement 
and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments and how those risks 
potentially affect the performance and financial position of the Company. The risks concerned are 
categorised as follows:
    a.      Potential Market Risks, which are principally:
    i.        Currency Risk
    ii.       Interest Rate Risk and
    iii.      Other Price Risk.
    b.      Liquidity Risk
    c.       Credit Risk
   Each is considered in turn below:
   A (i) Currency Risk
   The portfolio as at 31 December 2020 was invested predominantly in sterling securities, with the 
exception of Ryanair (Irish) and there was no significant currency risk arising from the possibility of a 
fall in the value of sterling impacting upon the value of investments or income.
   The Company had no foreign currency borrowings at 31 December 2020 or 31 December 2019 and no 
sensitivity analysis is presented for this risk.
                   2020             2019
            % Change (1)     % Change (1)
  Euro              -5.5             +5.8
                ========         ========
  1      Percentage change of sterling against local currency from 1 January to 31 December of relevant 
year.
   Based on the financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2020 and all other things being equal, if 
sterling had strengthened by 10%, the profit after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2020 and the 
Company's net assets at 31 December 2020 would have decreased by the amounts shown  in the table below. If 
sterling had weakened by 10% this would have had the opposite effect.

  Euro       1,369        682
          ========   ========
  A (ii) Interest Rate Risk
   The Company did not hold fixed interest securities at 31 December 2020 or 31 December 2019.
   With the exception of cash, no interest rate risks arise in respect of any current asset. All cash held 
as a current asset is sterling denominated, earning interest at the bank's or custodian's variable 
interest rates.
   The Company had no borrowings at 31 December 2020 or 31 December 2019.
   A (iii) Other Price Risk
   The principal price risk for the Company is the price volatility of shares that are owned by the 
Company. As described in the Investment Manager's Review, the Company spreads its investments across 
different sectors and geographies, but, as shown by the Portfolio Analysis in the Business Review, the 
Company may maintain relatively strong concentrations in particular sectors selected by the Investment 
Manager.
   The effect on the portfolio of a 10.0% increase or decrease in market prices would have resulted in an 
increase or decrease of GBP17,789,000 (2019: GBP13,881,000) in the investments held at fair value through 
profit or loss at the period end, which is equivalent to 9.5% (2019: 8.9%) in the net assets attributable 
to equity holders. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
   B Liquidity Risk
   Liquidity Risk is considered to be small, because most of the portfolio is invested in readily 
realisable securities. As a consequence, cash flow risks are also considered to be immaterial. The 
Investment Manager estimates that, under normal market conditions and without causing excessive 
disturbance to the prices of the securities concerned, 60% of the portfolio could be liquidated in a non-
market impacting way within 7 days, based on 15% of average daily volume. This is conservative as it does 
not include the ability to access liquidity through block trades.
   C Credit Risk
   The Company invests in quoted equities and fixed interest securities. The Company's investments are 
held by BNP Paribas Securities Services ("the Depository"), which is a large international bank with a 
high reputation. The Company's normal practice is to remain fully invested at most times and not to hold 
very large quantities of cash. At 31 December 2020, cash at bank comprised GBP5,055,374 (2019: 
GBP16,601,860) held by the Depository.
   Credit Risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting settlement. This risk 
is considered to be very low because transactions are almost always undertaken on a delivery versus 
payment basis with member firms of the London Stock Exchange.
   D Capital management policies and procedures
   The Company's capital management objectives are:
    --         to ensure the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and
   --         to provide an adequate return to Shareholders by pursuing investment policies commensurately 
with the level of risk.
   The Company monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity, less cash and cash 
equivalents as presented on the face of the statement of financial position.
   The Company sets the amount of capital in proportion to its overall financing structure, i.e. equity 
and financial liabilities. The Company manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the 
light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to 
maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to 
Shareholders (within the statutory limits applying to investment trusts), return capital to Shareholders, 
issue new shares, or sell assets.
   18. POST PERIOD END EVENTS
   On 3 February 2021, a total of 1,061,130 Ordinary Shares were issued to the Investment Manager, 
representing 80% of the total fee due. The Ordinary Shares were issued at the latest prevailing NAV as at 
28 January 2021 of 200.43 pence per Ordinary Share.
   Subsequent to the year end the Company's holding in Redrow was disposed in its entirety for GBP6.2 
million.

down to a valuation of GBPnil (2019: GBPnil) as the respective listings have been suspended.

and Phoenix SG, a Cayman Islands company.
   STATEMENT FROM THE CIO OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER
   Warren Buffett says the first rule of investing is: Don't Lose Money. We tackled the COVID-19 challenge 
in that way whilst retaining our focus on upside value. We put considerable effort into ensuring we owned 
businesses that would survive a bad lockdown and emerge better positioned competitively, or at least no 
worse. We believe that worked, our intrinsic values never fell to the levels of share prices before the 
pandemic started, not in one holding.
   Buffett's second rule is: Don't Forget Rule No.1. and so, as we sought out opportunities in 2020, it 
was with a heavy focus on the downside risk and the probability of our making a mistake in our evaluation. 
This second factor weighed heavily. There were plenty of cheap looking stocks around in Q2 of 2020 but it 
takes a detailed level of knowledge and expertise to be able to model what will happen to a business if 
the pandemic drags on and vaccines don't work. We were able to deploy our excess cash in businesses we 
already knew well and where we set a minimum upside of 200%. We looked at hundreds of opportunities and 
capital raises and passed on everything bar one small addition, which moved before we could get a proper 
holding.
   The result is that we emerge from the pandemic with an undervalued portfolio positioned to thrive in 
the resumption of activity and with fewer competitors.
   Our focus on risk monitoring and making the most of the downturn meant that we postponed the launch of 
the vehicle we mentioned last year. It is now formed and we plan to launch it this year. It is called the 
Castelnau Group and, as outlined in the Chairman's Statement, we are presently in dialogue with the Board 
for its inclusion in the Company's portfolio. Apart from containing the businesses we are seeking to grow 
the value of through our engagement, it also contains the companies we are using to do that   in the 
fields of data science, software development and digital marketing. The skills they learn in the group 
Aurora Investment Trust PLC Final Results -3-
they will be applying to external companies thereby creating additional value for our investors. We are 
now looking to apply that capability to new candidates. We will write with more details soon.
   As the world recovers from the pandemic and support programmes end, there is the potential for 
opportunities in those businesses impaired by what just happened. We are always looking for opportunities 
and will look wherever we think we might find them. In the meantime, we expect great things of the 
portfolio.
   GARY CHANNON
   CIO PHOENIX ASSET MANAGEMENT PARTNERS
   2 June 2021
   INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVIEW AND OUTLOOK
   During the year, the NAV per share reduced by 5.3% and the share price by 10.0%. The FTSE All-Share 
Index fell by 9.8% over the same period. Since Phoenix began managing the Company on 27 January 2016 its 
NAV has risen 47.7% versus 34.5% for the FTSE All-Share Index.
   The outperformance in 2020 has resulted in a performance fee being earned by Phoenix. In accordance 
with our Investment Management Agreement, the performance fee was settled by the issuance to Phoenix of 
Ordinary Shares in the Company, which Phoenix must hold for 3 years. If the outperformance versus the 
index disappears on the third-year anniversary, these Ordinary Shares will be forfeited, and Phoenix will 
receive nothing. This, we believe, is one of the most aligned fee structures in the industry.
   Over the course of 2020, the Company's Ordinary Shares traded at a premium to NAV which enabled Aurora 
to issue a total of 8.6 million new Ordinary Shares worth GBP13.6 million (including 530,311 issued to the 
Investment Manager to settle the performance fee with a value of GBP1.2 million). Net assets at year-end, 
as disclosed in the financial statements were GBP162.9 million (2019: GBP154.4 million). As we write in 
late May, the portfolio and the overall market have enjoyed a positive performance as confidence increases 
with the impact of vaccinations facilitating a return to normality. As of   30 April, the NAV has risen 
8.6% for the year with the FTSE All-Share Index rising 9.8%.
   PERFORMANCE REVIEW
   From a performance perspective, it is stating the obvious to say that the year was defined by the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Q1 2020 the NAV fell well over 40% by late March, before a small rally 
saw it down 38.6% at quarter end. The All-Share index was down 25% over the same period.
   Q2 2020 saw a modest recovery with the Company rising 16.6% during the quarter to end the half year 
down 28% versus the index which was down 17.4% at the same point.
   Q3 2020 was flat with significant uncertainty as the emergence from the first national lockdown was 
offset by the reimposition of travel bans in the late summer. At the end of the third quarter the Company 
was unchanged from 30 June, down 28.1% on the year with the index down 20%.
   In Q4 2020 the Company and the overall market experienced a strong rally which was driven by news of 
the high vaccine efficacy and the likelihood of their availability by year end. The Company rose 31.5% 
during the quarter to end the year down 5.5% with the index ending the year down 9.7%.
   From a share price perspective, there were many holdings which experienced price falls well in excess 
of the market in the first quarter. These included our housebuilders: Barratt Developments, Bellway and 
Redrow, and other holdings: easyJet and Frasers Group. Hornby, Randall & Quilter and GlaxoSmithKline 
counterbalanced these falls as they fell by only single digits during the first quarter.

   Then, as calendar 2020 drew to a close and Europe was suffering from a second wave of infections, we drew 
succour from the unequivocally excellent vaccine data. This encouraged us to strengthen our view that a second V-
shape is likely: this time in the consumer sphere. During the six-month period under review, we tilted the portfolio 
towards the consumer discretionary sector. Notwithstanding, at times, hysterical media and political rhetoric 
concerning vaccine rollouts, vaccine efficacy and even vaccine nationalism, we have resolutely trusted the data. 
Thus, we have not been swayed in building the portfolio's positions in stocks we consider strong reopening 
beneficiaries. Prime examples include Adidas, Amadeus, Carlsberg, Daimler, Essilor Luxottica, Inditex, Mowi, 
Ryanair and Stellantis.
   The Company's optimistic positioning for the 'reopening' can be illuminated through that familiar, but temporarily 
elusive, modern ritual: the summer holiday. It is quite likely that you will unwittingly book your flights and 
accommodation using the Amadeus Global Distribution System. You may well fly to your destination with Ryanair, 
or a different airline on an Airbus A320 jet. A new holiday wardrobe might include clothes from Zara, Ray-Ban 
sunglasses and La Roche-Posay sun cream. In doing so, you have generated sales for Inditex, Essilor Luxottica 
and L'Oreal respectively. You may dine in a restaurant supplied with salmon from Mowi and beverages from 
Carlsberg. The desire to travel, consume and experience is the common denominator. Our belief is that this desire 
will be expressed with renewed fervour.
   The Company's current investment positioning, then, can be summed up fairly simply: it is one which seeks to 
benefit from what we believe will be a happy confluence: an army of immunised consumers, armed with 
exceptionally high savings ratios. After a year or more of being unnaturally confined, the consumer is a coiled 
spring, ready to live life again. If we are right that not even a bungling European Union can prevent that, we can 
look forward to its powerful effects on our portfolio companies.

   COVID-19:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
   FY21 was the most challenging in Ryanair's 35-year history.  Covid-19 saw traffic collapse, almost 
overnight, from 149m to just 27.5m as many European Govts. (with little notice or co-ordination) imposed 
flight bans, travel restrictions and national lockdowns. There was a partial recovery during summer 2020, 
as initial lockdowns eased, however a second Covid-19 wave in Europe followed quickly in the autumn with a 
third wave in spring.  This created enormous disruptions and uncertainty for both our customers and our 
people, as they suffered constantly changing Govt. guidelines, travel bans and restrictions.  Ryanair 
responded promptly, and effectively, to this crisis, by working hard to assist millions of customers with 
flight changes, refunds and changed travel plans.  We minimised job losses through agreed pay cuts and 
participation in Govt. job support schemes, while at the same time keeping our pilots, cabin crew and 
aircraft current and ready to resume service once normality returns.
   The Covid-19 crisis precipitated the collapse of a number of EU airlines including Flybe, Norwegian, 
Germanwings and Level and substantial capacity cuts at many others.  It sparked a tsunami of State Aid 
from EU Govts. to their insolvent flag carriers including Alitalia, AirFrance/KLM, LOT, Lufthansa, SAS, 
TAP and others, which will distort EU competition and prop up high cost, inefficient, flag carriers for 
many years.  We expect intra-European air travel capacity to be materially lower for the foreseeable 
future.  This will create opportunities for Ryanair to extend airport growth incentives, as the Group 
takes delivery of 210 new (lower cost) Boeing 737s.  We are encouraged by the recent release of multiple 
Covid-19 vaccines and hope that their rollout will facilitate the resumption of intra-Europe air travel 
and tourism this summer.  If, as is presently predicted, most European populations are vaccinated by 
Sept., then we believe that we can look forward to a strong recovery in air travel, jobs and tourism in H2 
of the current fiscal year (FY22). The recent strong increases in weekly bookings since early April 
suggests that this recovery has already begun.
   THE ENVIRONMENT:
   Ryanair has shown that we can grow low fare traffic while reducing our impact on the environment.   
Every passenger that switches to Ryanair from one of Europe's legacy airlines cuts their CO emissions by 
almost 50% per flight.  Over the next 5-years Ryanair's traffic will grow to 200m p.a.  This will be 
achieved in a manner that balances the desire for low fares with the need for sustainable flying.  
Ryanair's $20bn+ investment in new technology aircraft will be pivotal in achieving this ambition.  The 
new B737-8200 "Gamechanger" aircraft offers 4% more seats, but delivers a 16% lower fuel burn and 40% 
lower noise emissions which will help Ryanair to lower its CO and noise footprint over the next decade.
   The Group continues to work actively with the EU, fuel suppliers and aircraft manufacturers to 
incentivise sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use.  We are working with A4E and the EU Commission to 
accelerate reform to the Single European Sky, so that we can minimize ATC delays and the resulting 
avoidable oil consumption and CO emissions.  In 2020 Ryanair received a (first time) "B-" climate 
protection rating from CDP [1] .  While this is a strong inaugural rating, highlighting Ryanair's 
excellent environmental performance and governance, the Group is committed to improving this score over 
the next 2 years.  In April, Ryanair established a Sustainable Aviation Research Centre partnership with 
Trinity College Dublin to help accelerate the development of SAF. Ryanair's goal is to power 12.5% of its 
flights with SAF by 2030.  This, together with the Group's investment in new Gamechanger aircraft will 
help Ryanair achieve its target of lowering CO per passenger/km by 10% to just 60 grams by 2030.
   FY21 BUSINESS REVIEW:
   Revenue & Costs
   FY21 revenue fell by 81% to EUR1.64bn, in line with the fall in traffic to just 27.5m from 149m (pre 
Covid-19). Ancillary revenue delivered a solid performance as more guests chose priority boarding and 
reserved seating, resulting in an 11% increase in per passenger spend to almost EUR22. FY21 cost 
performance was strong, falling 66%.  Due to an 81% reduction in traffic and aircraft delivery delays, the 
Group recorded a EUR200m ineffectiveness charge on fuel and currency hedges in FY21.
   During the past year substantial work has been undertaken to right size the Group's long-term cost 
leadership. This process commenced with significant cuts in senior management pay and the cancellation of 
FY21 management bonus payments this year.  Group airlines negotiated modest pay cuts with our people and 
their unions that minimised job losses but allow for pay restoration over years 3 to 5 under multi-year 
pay agreements.  Our Route Development teams continue to work with airport partners across Europe, and 
have negotiated lower airport costs, traffic recovery incentives and the extension of many low cost 
airport growth deals - incl., for example, long term extensions of low-cost growth deals in London 
Stansted (to 2028), Milan Bergamo (to 2028) & Brussels Charleroi (to 2030). In Dec. the Group increased 
its firm order for the B737-8200 Gamechanger from 135 to 210 aircraft while securing further, modest, 
price discounts.  Reasonable and fair compensation was also agreed with Boeing for the 2-year delivery 
delays to these aircraft.  The Gamechanger will, we believe, further widen the cost gap between Ryanair 
and all other European airlines for the next decade.  These new aircraft have 4% more seats, 16% lower 
fuel burn and 40% lower noise emissions and will enable the Ryanair Group to grow to 200m passengers p.a. 
over the next 5 years. Ryanair hopes to take delivery of its first Gamechanger aircraft in late May and 
hopes to have over 60 Gamechangers in the fleet before the peak S.22.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
   Balance Sheet & Liquidity
   The balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry with a BBB credit rating (S&P and 
Fitch), EUR3.15bn cash at 31 Mar. and over 85% of the B737 fleet being unencumbered. Since Mar. 2020, the 
Group has lowered cash burn by cutting costs, participating in EU Govt. payroll support schemes, 
cancelling share buybacks and deferring non-essential capex.  Over the past year, the Group successfully 
raised c.EUR1.95bn in new finance (incl. EUR400m share placing, EUR850m eurobond and GBP600m CCFF) and 
cash was further boosted by supplier reimbursements during the year.  This financial strength enables the 
Group to capitalise on the many growth opportunities that will be available post Covid-19.
   EU OWNERSHIP & CONTROL POST-BREXIT:
   As previously advised, Ryanair has restricted voting rights of non-EU shareholders (now including UK 
nationals) from 1 Jan. 2021 to protect its EU airline licences post-Brexit.  A long-standing prohibition 
on non-EU citizens purchasing Ryanair's ordinary shares now also extends to UK nationals, which will 
ensure a steady increase in the  Company's EU shareholding (currently approx. 1/3 of economic rights but 
100% of voting rights).  We expect these restrictions will remain in place for the foreseeable future 
until the balance in favour of EU shareholders is restored or the EU & UK agree a less restrictive airline 
ownership and control regime than the current 50%+ nationality rule which dates back to the 1940s.  
Meanwhile, UK nationals and other non-EU investors may continue to invest only in ADRs which are listed on 
NASDAQ.

   FY22 continues to be challenging, with uncertainty around when and where Covid lockdowns and travel 
restrictions will be eased.  The Group expects Q1 traffic to be heavily curtailed to between 5m and 6m guests.  With 
a very close-in booking curve, visibility for the remainder of FY22 is close to zero although bookings have jumped 
significantly from a very low base since week 1 of April.  It is therefore impossible to provide meaningful FY22 
guidance at this time.  However, as recently announced, we think that FY22 traffic is likely to be towards the lower 
end of our previously guided range of 80m to 120m passengers.  We also (cautiously) believe that the likely 
outcome for FY22 is currently close to breakeven - assuming that a successful rollout of vaccines this summer 
allows a timely easing of European Govt. travel restrictions on intra-European traffic in time for the peak travel 
period of Jul./Aug./Sept.
   As we look beyond the Covid-19 crisis, and the successful completion of vaccination roll outs, the Ryanair Group 
expects to have a much improved cost base and a very strong balance sheet.  We will also benefit from a reduced 
fleet cost for the next decade as we take more deliveries of our B737 "Gamechanger" aircraft which will materially 
improve revenues with 4% more seats while substantially reducing unit costs, especially fuel. This will enable the 
Group to fund lower fares and capitalise on the many growth and market share opportunities that are now available 
across Europe, especially where competitor airlines have substantially cut capacity or failed. The Group expects to 
benefit from a strong rebound of pent up travel demand through the second half of 2021, and looks forward to 
returning to pre-Covid growth in summer 2022 with the help of the Gamechanger aircraft and new bases (incl. those 
recently announced in Billund, Riga, Stockholm, Zadar & Zagreb). Ryanair is committed to delivering this growth in 
an environmentally sustainable manner (which reduces both fuel consumption and CO emissions per passenger) 
while at the same time improving its industry leading customer service and customer experience.

competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the replacement of aircraft, costs 
associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., European Union 
("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, post-Brexit uncertainties, weather 
related disruptions, ATC strikes and staffing related disruptions, delays in the delivery of contracted 
aircraft, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour 
relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, 
the UK and Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social 
and political factors, global pandemics such as Covid-19 and unforeseen security events.

  Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   MD&A Year Ended March 31, 2021
   Introduction
   For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") (with the exception of the balance 
sheet commentary below) all figures and comments are by reference to the adjusted results excluding the 
exceptional item referred to below.
   European Government travel restrictions/lockdowns as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic means that the 
Ryanair Group operated a significantly reduced flying schedule in FY21. Therefore, the Group recorded a 
hedge ineffectiveness charge of EUR192M (net of tax) in relation to jet fuel hedges and an EUR8M charge 
(net of tax) in relation to ineffective currency cashflow hedges arising from delayed aircraft capital 
expenditure.
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues decreased by 81% to EUR1,036.0M due to an 81% decline in traffic to 27.5M guests as 
European Governments imposed travel restrictions/lockdowns due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This grounded 
approx. 99% of the Group's fleet for almost 4 months (from mid-March to late June). The Group operated 
approximately 26% of its normal twelve months schedule with a 71% load factor.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues decreased by 80% to EUR599.8M due to an 81% decline in traffic to 27.5M guests 
offset somewhat by a solid performance in priority boarding and reserved seating.
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues decreased by 81% to EUR1,635.8M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation was 24% lower at EUR571.0M   primarily due to lower amortisation as a result of reduced 
aircraft utilisation.
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil decreased by 80% to EUR542.6M due to a 74% reduction in sectors flown, arising from Covid-
19 fleet groundings and lower fuel burn.
   Staff costs:

Body
   The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, 
including the risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates. Ryanair uses 
forward contracts for the purchase of its jet fuel requirements to reduce its exposure to commodity price 
risk. It also uses foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to risks related to foreign 
currencies, principally the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the purchase of new Boeing 737-8200 
aircraft and the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the purchase of jet fuel.
   The Group recognises all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in its consolidated 
balance sheet and measures them at fair value. At March 31, 2021, a net liability of EUR46M (2020: net 
liability EUR1,228M) was recognised on-balance sheet in respect of the Group's jet fuel derivative 
instruments and a net asset of EUR171M (2020: net asset EUR486M) was recognised in respect of its foreign 
currency derivative instruments associated with future aircraft purchases.
   In determining the hedge effectiveness of derivative instruments used to hedge Ryanair's fuel 
requirements, there is significant judgement involved in assessing whether the volumes of jet fuel hedged 
are still expected to be highly probable forecast transactions. Specifically, significant judgement is 
required in respect of the assumptions related to the timing of the full removal of flight restrictions 
imposed by European Governments relating to the Covid-19 pandemic, the expected recovery of passenger 
demand and the subsequent flight schedules. All of these assumptions impact upon forecast fuel 
consumption, and minor changes to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the assessment of 
hedge effectiveness.
   In respect of foreign currency hedge effectiveness for future aircraft purchases, there is a high 
degree of judgement involved in assessing whether the future aircraft payments are still considered highly 
probable of occurring, and the timing of these future payments for aircraft. The timing of future payments 
for aircraft is dependent on the aircraft manufacturer's ability to meet forecast aircraft delivery 
schedules.
   The Boeing 737-MAX was grounded in 2019. In November 2020 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
rescinded the order that grounded the Boeing-MAX aircraft in the U.S.A. The European Union Aviation Safety 
Agency (EASA) similarly ungrounded the Boeing-MAX aircraft in Europe in late January 2021. In April 2021, 
both the FAA and EASA certified the Boeing 737-8200 aircraft.
    3.          Seasonality of operations
   The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -6-
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
    4.             Income tax expense
   The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the year ended March 31, 2021 
was a credit of 8.4% (March 31, 2020: a charge of 3.2%).  The tax credit for the year ended March 31, 2021 
of EUR93.6M (March 31, 2020: charge of EUR21.6M) comprises a deferred tax credit of EUR99.1M primarily 
relating to net operating losses and the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment, offset 
by a current tax charge of EUR5.5M.
    5.             Share based payments
   The terms and conditions of the Group's share based remuneration programmes are disclosed in the most 
recent, published, consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR3.6M in the year ended March 31, 
2021 (March 31, 2020: EUR7.0M) is the fair value of share options granted in prior periods, which is being 
recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee services rendered.  During the year 
ended March 31, 2021, 3.6M ordinary shares were issued at a strike price between EUR6.25 and EUR11.38 per 
share following the exercise of vested share options.
    6.            Contingencies
   The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
    7.            Capital commitments
   At March 31, 2021 the Group had an operating fleet of 422 (2020: 440) Boeing 737 and 29 (2020: 26) 
Airbus A320 aircraft.
   In September 2014, the Group agreed to purchase up to 200 (100 firm and 100 options) Boeing 737-8200 
aircraft, subsequently increased to 210 (135 firm and 75 options). In December 2020, the Group increased 
its firm orders from 135 to 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft. The Ryanair Group hopes to take delivery of its 
first aircraft in advance of peak summer 2021.
    8.            Analysis of operating segment
   The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the Group CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).
    8.           Analysis of operating segment - continued
   The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the profit/(loss) after tax of each airline 
for the reporting period. Resource allocation decisions for all airlines are based on airline performance 
for the relevant period, with the objective in making these resource allocation decisions being to 
optimize consolidated financial results.
   Ryanair DAC and Malta Air are reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. Buzz and Lauda do 
not exceed the quantitative thresholds for reporting purposes and accordingly have been presented on an 
aggregate basis in the table below.

   Staff costs decreased by 57% to EUR472.2M due to reduced flight hours, Group wide pay cuts and 
participation in European Government payroll support schemes. Refer to Note 17 for further detail.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges decreased by 75% to EUR287.2M due to lower sectors flown and reduced 
charges.
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs decreased by 19% to EUR206.7M due to reduced aircraft utilisation, 
offset by lease hand back charges.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other decreased by 65% to EUR201.5M due to lower discretionary spending 
across the Group airlines and fewer flights qualifying for EU261 compensation due to improved (96%) on-
time performance.
   Route charges:
   Route charges decreased by 75% to EUR187.3M due to lower sectors arising from Covid-19 fleet 
groundings.
   Aircraft rentals:
   Aircraft rentals fell by 82% to EUR6.7M due to 11 fewer leased B737 aircraft in the fleet.
   Other expense:
   Net finance expense increased by EUR2.3M to EUR53.8M primarily due to increased debt and lower deposit 
interest rates, offset by the maturity of more expensive secured debt.
   Balance sheet
   Gross cash decreased by EUR657.7M to EUR3,150.3M at March 31, 2021.
   Gross debt increased by EUR1,215.6M to EUR5,426.8M, primarily due to a EUR850M Eurobond issuance in 
September 2020 and the drawdown of GBP600M unsecured debt under the HMT and Bank of England CCFF, offset 
by secured debt and lease liability payments. Net debt, which includes current and non-current maturities 
of debt and lease liabilities, less restricted cash, financial assets > 3 months and cash and cash 
equivalents was EUR2,276.5M at year end.
   Shareholders' equity:
   Shareholders' equity decreased by EUR267.9M to EUR4,646.6M in the year primarily due to a net loss of 
EUR1,015.1M offset by a EUR400.0M equity placing in September 2020, and an unrealised IFRS hedge 
accounting gain of EUR322.6M.

   Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
   Preliminary Financial Statements
    1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
   Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated preliminary financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2021 comprise 
the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
   These unaudited condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements ("the preliminary financial 
statements"), which should be read in conjunction with our 2020 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 
2020, have been prepared to include information equivalent to that required for condensed interim 
financial statements in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial 
Reporting" as adopted by the EU ("IAS 34"). They do not include all of the information required for full 
annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2020, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/.
   The March 31, 2021 figures and the March 31, 2020 comparative figures do not constitute statutory 
financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2020, together with the independent 
auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual 
General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
   The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated preliminary financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2021 on May 14, 2021.
   Except as stated otherwise below, this year's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
   Government grants
   Grants that compensate the Group for related expenses incurred are recognized in the income statement 
on a systematic basis in the periods in which the related expenses are recognized in staff costs.
   New IFRS standards and amendments adopted during the year
   The following new and amended IFRS standards, amendments and IFRIC interpretations, have been issued by 
the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the 
Group's financial year beginning on April 1, 2020 and therefore have been applied by the Group in these 
condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements:
   --    Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendments to IFRS 3 - Definition of a Business (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of Material (effective for fiscal periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendment to IFRS 16 - Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions (effective for fiscal periods beginning 
on or after June 1, 2020)
   The calculation methodology of EURIBOR changed during 2019. In July 2019, the Belgian Financial 
Services and Markets Authority granted authorisation with respect to EURIBOR under the European Union 
Benchmarks regulation. This allows market participants to continue to use EURIBOR for both existing and 
new contracts and the Group expects that EURIBOR will continue to exist as a benchmark for the foreseeable 
future.
   The Group has evaluated the extent to which its cashflow hedging relationships are subject to 
uncertainty driven by IBOR reform as at March 31, 2021. The Group's hedged items and hedging instruments 
continue to be indexed to EURIBOR. These benchmark rates are quoted each day and the IBOR cash flows are 
exchanged with counterparties as usual.
   The adoption of these new or amended standards as listed above did not have a material impact on the 
Group's financial position or results from operations in the year ended March 31, 2021.
   New IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
   The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for the purposes 
of the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable.  While under review, we do not 
anticipate that the adoption of the other new or revised standards and interpretations will have a 
material impact on our financial position or results from operations:
   --    IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2023)*

(effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021)
   --    Amendments to IFRS 16 - Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions Beyond June 30, 2021 (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning or after April 1, 2021)*

for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023)*
   --    Amendments to IAS 8 - Definition of Accounting Estimates (effective for fiscal periods beginning 
on or after January 1, 2023)*
   * These standards or amendments to standards are not as of yet EU endorsed
   Statement of Cash Flows restatement
   Operating cash inflows and investing cash outflows for the year ended March 31, 2020 have been 
reclassified. They both have been reduced by EUR617M to address accrued supplier payables which had 
previously been presented as a capital expenditure cash outflow in investing activities and as a movement 
in working capital in operating activities. As no actual cash flows arose and the payable is not working 
capital related, both line items required adjustments.
   There is no impact on the Group's net cash flows, consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income and 
basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended March 31, 2020.
    2.            Judgements and estimates
   The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
   In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the most recent published 
consolidated financial statements.

  *The fair value of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values due to the short-term 
nature of the instruments.
    13.           Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
   In April 2020, the Group raised GBP600M unsecured debt for general corporate purposes under the HMT and 
Bank of England CCFF. This was subsequently extended in March 2021 for a further 12 months. Refer to Note 
17 for further information.
   The Group issued senior, unsecured bonds with a face value of EUR850M in September 2020. The bond has a 
coupon rate of 2.875% and a maturity date of September 2025.
    14.          Trade payables
   In December 2020, the Group increased its firm order for Boeing 737-8200 aircraft by 75 (from 135 to 
210 units). Taking account of the revised aircraft delivery schedule and changes in the contracted timing 
of aircraft pre-delivery payments, certain aircraft pre-delivery payables were reduced with an offset in 
Property, plant and equipment. In accordance with the revised delivery schedule, EUR179.9M of trade 
payables are now due after 1 year.
    15.          Shareholders equity and shareholder returns
   In September 2020, 35.2M ordinary shares were issued via an ordinary share placing at a price of 
EUR11.35 per share generating EUR400M proceeds.
   During the period 3.6M ordinary shares were issued at a strike price between EUR6.25 and EUR11.38 per 
share following the exercise of vested share options.
   There were no shareholder returns during the year ended March 31, 2021.
   In FY20 the Company bought back 47.2M shares at a total cost of EUR580.5M. This buyback was equivalent 
to approximately 4.2% of the Company's issued share capital at March 31, 2020.  All of these repurchased 
ordinary shares were cancelled at March 31, 2020.
   As a result of the share buybacks in the year ended March 31, 2020, share capital decreased by 47.2M 
ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR580.5M and the other undenominated capital reserve increased by 
a corresponding EUR0.3M. The other undenominated capital reserve is required to be created under Irish law 
to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
    16.          Related party transactions
   The Company's related parties comprise its subsidiaries, Directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -8-
   There were no related party transactions in the year ended March 31, 2021 that materially affected the 
financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in the 
related party transactions described in the 2020 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the 
financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
    17.            Government grants and assistance
   During the year ended March 31, 2021, many European countries in which the Ryanair Group operates made 
available payroll support schemes. The Group utilised a number of these employment retention schemes to 
protect jobs within the Group. These schemes were a mix of short term Covid-19 specific programmes and 
long term schemes linked to social security that existed pre Covid-19. The total amount of payroll 
supports received by the Group under the various schemes amounted to approximately EUR84M and are offset 
against staff costs in the Consolidated Income Statement.
   In April 2020, the Group raised GBP600M unsecured debt for general corporate purposes under the HMT and 
Bank of England CCFF. The 0.44% interest rate was the prevailing rate for strong BBB rated companies . 
This debt was subsequently extended in March 2021 for a further 12 months at a 0.46% interest rate.
   There are no unfulfilled conditions attaching to government assistance at March 31, 2021.
    18.          Post balance sheet events
   There were no significant post balance sheet events.
    19.          Going concern
   The Board are satisfied that it remains appropriate to adopt the going concern concept. In arriving at 
this decision, the Board considered, among other things:
   1.    The Ryanair Group's liquidity with over EUR3.15bn cash at March 31 2021 and the Group's continued 
focus on cash management;
    2.    The Group's solid BBB credit ratings (from both S&P and Fitch Ratings);
    3.    The Group's strong balance sheet with over 85% of its B737 fleet unencumbered;
    4.    Ongoing cost reductions across the Group;
   5.    The widespread rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in Europe, with it widely reported that 80% of the 
adult population will be vaccinated in Europe before the end of June 2021; and
   6.    The Group's flexibility to react quickly to improved customer demand following vaccine rollouts 
and the gradual easing of European Governments travel restrictions/lockdowns over the course of the next 
12 months.

   Net capital additions for the year ended March 31, 2021 amounted to a credit of approximately EUR575M, 
principally 
reflecting 
the 
reversal 
of 
certain 
aircraft 
pre-delivery 
trade 
payables, 
supplier 
reimbursements of just under EUR380M offset by capital expenditure of approximately EUR300M.
    11.          Assets held for sale
   In August 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to sell 10 Boeing 737NG aircraft for delivery in 
FY20 and FY21. 3 of these aircraft were sold in the year ended March 31, 2020. The remaining 7 aircraft 
were sold during the year ended March 31, 2021 . The gains on disposal are disclosed in net finance 
expense on the condensed consolidated preliminary Income Statement.
    12.          Derivative financial instruments
   As a result of the widespread grounding of aircraft due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group operated a 
significantly reduced flying schedule for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to what was originally 
expected. Accordingly, during the year ended March 31, 2021, the Group's exposures for jet fuel and 
foreign currency were significantly reduced, causing a proportion of derivative financial instruments 
which previously qualified for hedge accounting to become ineffective, resulting in the discontinuance of 
certain cash-flow hedge arrangements. A net expense of EUR200M (net of tax) was recognised within the 
income statement for the year ended March 31, 2021 (2020: EUR353M), comprising a charge of EUR192M (net of 
tax) in respect of jet fuel exposures (2020: EUR392M) and a charge of EUR8M (net of tax), primarily 
associated with ineffective currency cash-flow hedges for FY21 jet fuel and delayed aircraft deliveries 
(2020: gain of EUR39M).
   As of March 31 2021, a EUR109M gain is recognised in the cash flow reserve in respect of continuing 
hedges and EUR102M gain in respect of hedging relationships for which hedge accounting is no longer 
applied . The balance on the hedging reserve as of March 31, 2021 is a gain of EUR211M.
    13.           Financial instruments and financial risk management
   The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
   These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2020 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
   Fair value hierarchy
   Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -7-
   --    Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
the Group can access at the measurement date.
   --    Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    --    Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
   Fair value estimation
   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
   Financial instruments measured at fair value
   --    Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
   --          Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and EUA contracts: A comparison of 
the contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2021 
has been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
   The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the year ended March 31, 2021, there 
were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
   Financial instruments not measured at fair value
   --          Long-term debt: The repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at March 31, 2021 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
   While there have been significant changes in business and economic circumstances during fiscal year 
2021, the future outlook for the business is such that there has been no material change to the fair 
values of financial assets and financial liabilities.
   The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

   For those looking for short-term attribution, detractors over the past six months included Adevinta, MorphoSys, 
Kingspan, adidas, and Takeaway.com. Operationally at least, these are all companies that are performing well with 
attractive long-term prospects. Adevinta, which is building online classifieds platforms across the world, covering 
real estate, cars and jobs, is a good example. Its share price fell around 20% over the six months given its exposure 
to markets that were unsurprisingly weak. However, its longer-term prospects have not changed. It's continuing to 
invest in its business, and we believe that it will return to growth rates of 15-20% while being able to raise prices 
and margins on its under-monetised platforms. MorphoSys, whose share price fell almost 40% is another example. 
This is a German drug discovery platform that has recently had its first major approval for an antibody to treat some 
blood cancers. We believe that this will be transformational for the company yet, because of the difficulty marketing 
this during lockdown and a change in appetite for 'risk', its shares were penalised by the market. Conversely, 
companies like Ryanair and Kuehne & Nagel, a logistics company, performed well as sentiment on short-term 
recovery and Covid vaccinations improved.
   On the private company side, Northvolt has been making impressive progress which gives us even more 
confidence that this is a company that will create tremendous value for investors, other stakeholders and also 
society. We think the recent US$14bn order to supply VW with premium battery cells over the next decade provides 
strong evidence of its innovation and manufacturing expertise. The present funding round has the company valued 
at US$9bn, more than double its valuation when we first invested in September 2020.There is a long way to go but 
we feel very fortunate that we have been able to make this our first private investment. We are in talks with other 
private companies and will hopefully be in a position to provide an update on those in due course.
   Transactions
   Our annualised turnover for the six-month period was just over 18%. This means that our average holding period 
is around five years but, more importantly, that we are giving ourselves enough time to benefit from compound 
growth which in turn leads to exponential growth. In a practical sense, this also means we are only looking for 
roughly five to ten new ideas each year although the timing of these can be variable. In the last six months we 
bought seven new holdings which included: Allegro.eu, Poland's leading e-commerce business that has around 
40% share of online sales in the country; Dassault Systèmes, a provider of 3D software; FinecoBank and Avanza 
Baillie Gifford European Grw Ts PLC Half-year -2-
Bank which are online trading and investment platforms in Italy and Sweden respectively; AUTO1, a pan-European 
marketplace for buying and selling used cars; Wizz Air, an Eastern European low-cost airline similar in many ways 
to Ryanair; and HelloFresh, a meal-kit delivery business. In each case, we think there are large markets to grow 
into, disruptive business models which are competing against traditional incumbents, and valuations which leave us 
with a decent probability of at least doubling our initial investment.
   We made two disposals during this period, Novozymes and U-Blox. Novozymes is the world's leading 
manufacturer of industrial enzymes. We now believe that its core business segments have matured and that the 
potential of returning to more significant leaps in innovation is greatly diminished. U-Blox, a fabless semiconductor 
business based in Switzerland, just hasn't worked out. It has suffered from a lack of demand, delays in customer 
investments, and top management departures. Some of these problems seem temporary, but others strike us as 
structural issues. The conclusion we have drawn is that U-Blox is less well placed than we had initially believed to 
benefit from the tailwind from the Internet of Things, and it is less well run than we had thought.
   You will have noticed that we've bought more new positions than we have sold. The balance has been funded 
through small reductions to some companies that were especially strong Covid beneficiaries like Zalando, Sartorius 
Stedim, Bechtle and Addlife. These cover e-commerce, vaccine production, healthcare supplies, and IT hardware. 
We very much still believe in their longer-term prospects but felt it prudent to reflect slightly lower probabilities of at 
least doubling from here over the next five years. In addition, we also utilised some gearing which stood at 7.1%, 
net of cash, at the end of the period. Part of this comes from a new long-term debt facility that provides EUR30m at 
a fixed rate of 1.57% over 20 years, which we believe is very attractive.
   Outlook
   Given the general performance of equities, it's inevitable that we are asked about valuations and whether the 
recent rotation from growth to value has inspired us to look for a few more 'defensive' companies. Our response, 
which shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, is that we won't be changing our investment style just because it is 
at times out of favour with short-term market sentiment. If anything, we'll be looking for opportunities to add to 
existing holdings that have been unfairly sold off or follow up on growth companies that we've been waiting patiently 
to buy. We have to be cognisant of valuations, but our objective has always been to find growth that has been 
mispriced, and companies that can deliver at least a 2x return over a five-year period. In terms of outlook, we really 
don't think it's hyperbole to suggest that we are just at the start of one of the greatest transitions of market 
leadership that Europe has ever seen. With this in mind, and a very clear idea of what characteristics we want 
companies to have, we will continue to endeavour to unearth what we think are Europe's next big winners.
   The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company are set out at the back of this announcement.

Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].
   (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be 
presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   Notes
   (i) . Persons completing this form should have regard to the requirements of the Transparency

Transparency Rules (the "Transparency Rules") and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/761 of 17 
December 2014.
   (ii) Full name of the legal entity and other identifying specification of the issuer or underlying

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.

(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who

Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of

at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.

2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   Notes
   (i) . Persons completing this form should have regard to the requirements of the Transparency

Transparency Rules (the "Transparency Rules") and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/761 of 17 
December 2014.
   (ii) Full name of the legal entity and other identifying specification of the issuer or underlying

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring 
temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10

   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.

presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   Notes
   (i) . Persons completing this form should have regard to the requirements of the Transparency 
(Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 as amended (the "Regulations"), the Central Bank of Ireland's 
Transparency Rules (the "Transparency Rules") and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/761 of 17 
December 2014.
   (ii) Full name of the legal entity and other identifying specification of the issuer or underlying 
issuer, provided it is reliable and accurate (e.g. address, LEI, domestic number identity).

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring 
temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10

or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or 
legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;

   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].

presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   Notes
   (i) . Persons completing this form should have regard to the requirements of the Transparency 
(Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 as amended (the "Regulations"), the Central Bank of Ireland's 
Transparency Rules (the "Transparency Rules") and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/761 of 17 
December 2014.
   (ii) Full name of the legal entity and other identifying specification of the issuer or underlying 
issuer, provided it is reliable and accurate (e.g. address, LEI, domestic number identity).
   (iii) Other reason for the notification could be voluntary notifications, changes of attribution of the 
nature of the holding (e.g. expiring of financial instruments) or acting in concert.
   (iv) This should be the full name of (a) the shareholder; (b) the natural person or legal entity

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring 
temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
of Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person 
or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or 
legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;

or legal entity who is disposing of the voting rights when the life interest is created;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].

presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].
   (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be 
presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   RYANAIR UPDATES FY21 GUIDANCE
   NEW RANGE OF -EUR800M TO -EUR850M (PREV. -EUR850M TO -EUR950M)
   STRONG LIQUIDITY WITH OVER EUR3.15BN CASH AT YEAR END
   Ryanair Holdings plc today (7 April) briefed the market that it expects to report a pre-exceptional 
FY21 (yr. end 31 March 2021) net loss of between -EUR800m and -EUR850m (previously guided range of -
EUR850m to -EUR950m). The Ryanair Group's full-year traffic was 27.5m (down from 149m in FY20) due to 
Covid-19 govt. flight cancellations and travel restrictions.
   Ryanair's balance sheet remains strong with a BBB credit rating (S&P and Fitch) and significant 
liquidity. Year-end cash (31 March) was over EUR3.15bn, while more than 84% of the Group's owned fleet of 
420 B737 aircraft are unencumbered.
   Easter travel restrictions/lockdowns and a delayed traffic recovery into the peak S.21 season, due to 
the slow rollout in the EU of Covid-19 vaccines, means that FY22 traffic is likely to be towards the lower 
end of our previously guided range of 80m to 120m passengers.  While it is not possible (at this time) to 
provide meaningful FY22 profit guidance, we do not share the recent optimism of certain analysts as we 
believe that the outcome for FY22 is currently close to breakeven.
   As this is a closed period, the Ryanair Group's next market update will be on 17 May when we release 
FY21 results.

   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the

another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   The Central Bank of Ireland ("Central Bank") may process personal data provided by you in order to 
fulfil its statutory functions or to facilitate its business operations. Any personal data will be

processing of personal data by the Central Bank may be directed to dataprotection@centralbank.ie . A copy

   Notes
   (i) . Persons completing this form should have regard to the requirements of the Transparency 
(Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 as amended (the "Regulations"), the Central Bank of Ireland's 
Transparency Rules (the "Transparency Rules") and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/761 of 17 
December 2014.
   (ii) Full name of the legal entity and other identifying specification of the issuer or underlying 
issuer, provided it is reliable and accurate (e.g. address, LEI, domestic number identity).
   (iii) Other reason for the notification could be voluntary notifications, changes of attribution of the 
nature of the holding (e.g. expiring of financial instruments) or acting in concert.
   (iv) This should be the full name of (a) the shareholder; (b) the natural person or legal entity 
acquiring, disposing of or exercising voting rights in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) 
of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC); or (c) the holder of financial 
instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring 
temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
of Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person 
or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or 
legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;
Ryanair Holdings PLC Holding(s) in Company -2-
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity who has a life interest in shares if that 
person or entity is entitled to exercise the voting rights attached to the shares and the natural person 
or legal entity who is disposing of the voting rights when the life interest is created;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].
   (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be 
presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring 
temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
of Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person 
or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or 
legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity who has a life interest in shares if that

or legal entity who is disposing of the voting rights when the life interest is created;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to

the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].
   (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be 
presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

     Civil Aviation Authority Transport Act 2000 investigation - final decision
   The UK Civil Aviation Authority has today published its decision in relation to an investigation 
(Project Palamon) under section 34 of the Transport Act 2000 (TA00). We have considered alleged 
contraventions by NATS (En-Route) Plc ("NERL") of certain statutory duties under the TA00 and certain 
conditions of its Air Traffic Services Licence. This investigation followed complaints by Ryanair and 
Stansted Airport about air traffic flow management delays experienced by airlines and passengers of 
Stansted and Luton airports.
   This investigation also follows an earlier investigation conducted by the Civil Aviation Authority 
addressing similar complaints brought by Ryanair and Stansted Airport in 2016 in relation to NERL's 
performance (Project Oberon).
   In our decision we found that:
   --    NERL contravened its statutory and Licence duties and obligations in the period January 2019 to 
March 2020 in relation to the provision of sufficient staffing resilience in the London Approach Service 
for users of Stansted and Luton airports; and
   --    in relation to the other allegations raised as part of the complaints, including on airspace 
capacity, coding and discrimination, NERL has not contravened its statutory and Licence duties and 
obligations.
   This decision confirms the Civil Aviation Authority's draft decision published for consultation on 17 
September 2020. Annex 1 to the decision summarises the representations received on the draft decision and 
explains how the Civil Aviation Authority took them into account in reaching the decision.
   In making these findings, we took into account the very difficult circumstances faced by the aviation 
sector and the significant reduction in air traffic volumes, following the impact of the Covid-19 
pandemic.  We also note that forecasts for recovery are highly uncertain and it appears likely it will 
take some time to reach traffic levels seen in 2018 and 2019.
   Given these circumstances, we consider it is not appropriate for us to take formal enforcement action, 
as the circumstances leading to the investigation are not currently occurring. Nonetheless, we make a 
number of recommendations that we expect NERL (and other stakeholders) to adopt in the future as they plan 
how to provide a resilient service when demand begins to recover, and in the longer term.

   Notes
   (i) . Persons completing this form should have regard to the requirements of the Transparency 
(Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 as amended (the "Regulations"), the Central Bank of Ireland's 
Transparency Rules (the "Transparency Rules") and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/761 of 17 
December 2014.
   (ii) Full name of the legal entity and other identifying specification of the issuer or underlying

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:

Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring

Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;

Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.

ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].

presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   This Announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Regulation 11 of the Market Abuse

   ("Ideagen," "the Company" or the "Group")
   Issue of Equity, PDMR Dealing and Total Voting Rights
   Ideagen PLC (AIM: IDEA), a leading supplier of Information Management Software to highly regulated industries, 
announces that yesterday it allotted a total of 167,000 new ordinary shares of 1 penny each in the capital of the 
Company ("Ordinary Shares") following the exercise of options by employees of the Company.
   In addition, Graeme Spenceley, Company Secretary and a PDMR of the Company, yesterday sold 200,000 
Ordinary Shares at a price of 285 pence per Ordinary Share (the "Sale").
   Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the 167,000 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to 
trading on AIM ("Admission") and it is expected that Admission will become effective and trading will commence at 
8.00 a.m. on 01 March 2021.
   After Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue will be 252,292,074 and the total number of voting 
rights will therefore be 252,292,074. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the 
calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest 
in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.

   Ideagen PLC (AIM: IDEA), a leading supplier of Information Management Software to highly regulated industries, 
announces that it has allotted a total of 3,023 new ordinary shares of 1 penny each in the capital of the Company

   Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the 3,023 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to 
trading on AIM ("Admission") and it is expected that Admission will become effective and trading will commence at

rights will therefore be 252,125,074. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the

   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.

another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Holding(s) in Company -2-
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.

   COVID-19:
   Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc across the industry.  Christmas & New Year traffic was severely impacted by 
UK travel bans imposed at short notice by many EU Govts on 19 & 20 Dec.  These flight bans, and travel 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
restrictions, saw the Group's Dec. traffic fall by 83% to just 1.9m passengers.  As announced on 7 Jan., Ryanair 
expects the latest lockdowns and pre-arrival Covid test requirement to materially reduce flight schedules and traffic 
through to Easter.  The Group's full-year (FY21) traffic forecast was therefore reduced to "between 26m to 30m" 
passengers.
   The Covid pandemic has caused the closure of EU airlines including Flybe, Germanwings, Level and Montenegro 
Airlines.  Norwegian has already entered a creditor protection examinership and Eurocontrol predicts more EU 
airline failures in 2021.  Significant capacity reductions have been implemented by many EU airlines and a flood of 
unlawful State Aid has been committed by EU Govts to their flag carriers including Alitalia, Air France/KLM, LOT, 
Lufthansa, SAS, TAP and others.  This illegal State Aid distorts competition and the level playing field across EU 
aviation.  We expect intra-European capacity to be significantly reduced for the next few years, which will create 
growth opportunities for Ryanair (Europe's lowest cost airline) to take advantage of recovery growth incentives, as it 
takes delivery of 210 new (lower cost) Boeing 737s.  As soon as the Covid-19 virus recedes - and it will over the 
coming months as EU Govts accelerate vaccine rollouts - Ryanair and its partner airports will rapidly restore 
schedules, recover lost traffic, help the nations of Europe to reboot their tourism industry, and create jobs for young 
people across the cities and beaches of the EU.  We take some comfort from the success of the UK vaccine 
programme which is on target to vaccinate almost 50% of the UK population (30m) by the end of March.  The EU 
now needs to step up the slow pace of its rollout programme to match the UK's performance.
   Q3 BUSINESS REVIEW:
   Revenue & Costs
   Q3 revenue fell by 82% to EUR0.34bn as traffic shrank by 78% to 8.1m.  Ancillary revenue delivered a solid 
performance as more guests chose priority boarding and reserved seating. Q3 cost performance was strong, falling 
63% thanks to the measures implemented over the past nine months.  Due to ongoing travel restrictions, reduced 
Q4 traffic and a revised aircraft delivery schedule, the Group recorded a EUR15m exceptional ineffectiveness 
charge on fuel and currency hedges in Q3.
   The Group airlines continue to implement cost reductions.  In Dec., Ryanair increased its firm order for the B737-
8200 "Gamechanger" aircraft by 75 to 210 aircraft.  These environmentally friendly aircraft have 4% more seats, but 
burn 16% less fuel and lower noise emissions by 40%. This winter, Group airlines are returning 14 older B737 
aircraft to lessors as leases mature and Ryanair has recently concluded the delivery of 7 older B737NGs (pre-sold 
in 2019) for cargo conversion.  Our Route Development teams are working with multiple airport partners on 
recovery/growth incentives.  During Q3 the Group announced a 2 aircraft base in Paris Beauvais, added a fourth 
aircraft to its Naples base for S.21, announced a 4 aircraft base in Venice Treviso and increased its route 
network/frequencies to Venice Marco Polo, Verona and Bari.  The Group also confirmed the reopening of its 
Shannon (Ireland) base for S.21.
   Recently, Ryanair concluded a 4-year extension of its low-cost growth deal in Stansted to 2028, extending the 
Groups low cost leadership in the key London market. The Group has also secured easyJet's 7 based aircraft slot 
portfolio in Stansted. To facilitate a ramp-up of S.21 operations, Ryanair is accelerating cabin crew training which 
will increase staff costs in Q4.  This investment, however, will ensure that Group airlines are well placed to take up 
traffic recovery opportunities that arise throughout S.21 and beyond.
   Balance Sheet & Liquidity
   Ryanair's balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry with a BBB credit rating (S&P and Fitch) and 
EUR3.5bn cash at 31 Dec. Approx. 80% of the Group's owned fleet is unencumbered (with a book value of over 
EUR7bn). Since Mar. 2020, the Group has lowered cash burn by cutting costs, participating in EU Govt payroll 
support schemes, cancelling share buybacks and deferring non-essential capex.  Following its successful fund 
raising (EUR400m share placing & EUR850m eurobond) in Sept., the Group is well financed as it takes delivery of 
its first B737-8200 aircraft in Q4 and plans to repay over EUR1.5bn maturing debt in the next 6-months (incl. CCFF 
GBP600m in Mar. & EUR850m bond in Jun. 2021).
   THE ENVIRONMENT:
   Ryanair recently received a (first time) B- climate protection rating from CDP, making it one of the highest rated 
airlines in the world.  While this is a strong inaugural rating, highlighting Ryanair's excellent environmental 
performance and very strong governance, the Group is committed to improving this score.  The new B737-8200s 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
with 4% more seats, 16% lower fuel burn and 40% lower noise emissions will help Ryanair to lower its CO and 
noise footprint and deliver on its target of being carbon neutral by 2050.  Ryanair airlines remain committed to 
eliminating non-recyclable plastic from our operations within 5-years and already over 80% of consumables 
onboard our flights are plastic free.
   BREXIT:
   Following the UK/EU Brexit trade agreement in late Dec., Ryanair implemented the measures necessary to 
remain majority EU owned and controlled to protect its EU airline licences. Ryanair has (as previously advised) 
restricted voting rights of non-EU shareholders from 1 Jan. The Group also received shareholder approval at its 
Dec. EGM to replace CREST with a system operated by Euroclear Bank for the electronic settlement of trading in 
Ryanair's ordinary shares.  The migration of Ryanair's ordinary shares to Euroclear will take place as part of a wider 
market migration of listed Irish companies shares at a date determined by Euronext Dublin - currently expected to 
be on or around 15 Mar. 2021.
   BOEING MAX UPDATE:
   In Dec., shortly after the FAAs ungrounding of the Boeing MAX aircraft in the U.S., Ryanair ordered a further 75x 
B737-8200 aircraft from Boeing increasing its firm order to 210 units.  Following EASAs recent certification of the 
MAX-8 to return to flying in Europe, we are hopeful that the B737-8200 will be certified in the coming weeks.  This 
will enable the Group to take delivery of up to 24 new aircraft before peak S.21. This order will deliver over a 4 year 
period between Spring 2021 and Dec. 2024 (FY25), facilitating traffic growth to 200m p.a. by FY26.  The B737-8200 
aircraft is a "Gamechanger" for Ryanair's customers and Europe's consumers.  This aircraft, when delivered, will be 
the most audited, most regulated in aviation history.  With an exceptional environmental performance, this 197 seat 
Boeing aircraft is the perfect sized platform to allow Ryanair expand and grow its low fare services across Europe 
over the next decade while widening Ryanair's unit cost leadership over all of our European airline competitors.
   OUTLOOK:
   FY21 will continue to be the most challenging year in Ryanair's 35 year history.  Recently announced Covid 
lockdowns and travel restrictions across the EU & UK will reduce forecast FY21 traffic to between 26m and 30m 
(previously "up to 35m"), with more risk towards the lower end of the range.  While Q4 visibility remains limited due 
to uncertain and constantly changing Covid-19 travel restrictions, European Govt lockdowns, the timing of the 
rollout of vaccines across the EU and a very close-in booking curve, we are cautiously guiding an FY21 net loss 
(pre-exceptional items) of between EUR850m and EUR950m.
   As we look beyond the Covid-19 crisis, and vaccinations roll out, the Ryanair Group expects to have a much 
lower cost base and a strong balance sheet, which will enable it to fund lower fares and add lower cost aircraft to 
capitalise on the many growth opportunities that will be available in all markets across Europe, especially where 
competitor airlines have substantially cut capacity or failed. We will work assiduously with our airport and Govt 
partners to restore routes and recover traffic for the benefit of our airports, our customers and our people as we try 
to prioritise the jobs and salary recovery of our people.

U.K., European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, uncertainties 
surrounding Brexit, weather related disruptions, ATC strikes and staffing related disruptions, delays in the delivery 
of contracted aircraft, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour

Body
   In respect of foreign currency hedge effectiveness for future aircraft purchases, there is a high 
degree of judgement involved in assessing whether the future aircraft payments are still considered highly 
probable of occurring, and the timing of these future payments for aircraft. The timing of future payments 
for aircraft is dependent on the aircraft manufacturer's ability to meet forecast aircraft delivery 
schedules.
   The Boeing 737-MAX was grounded in 2019. In November 2020 the FAA rescinded the order that grounded the 
aircraft, and published an Airworthiness Directive specifying design changes that must be made before the 
aircraft returns to service, issued a Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community 
(CANIC), and published the MAX training requirements. The first Ryanair Boeing 737-8200 was due to deliver 
in April 2019. However, due to the global grounding of the MAX aircraft by EASA and the FAA in March 2019, 
the first delivery is now expected to be in Q4 FY21.
    3.            Seasonality of operations
   The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
    4.            Income tax expense
   The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the nine-months ended December 
31, 2020 was 7.9% (December 31, 2019: 7.5%).  The tax credit for the nine-months ended December 31, 2020 
of EUR63.5M (December 31, 2019 charge: EUR100.6M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR10.7M and a 
deferred tax credit of EUR74.2M primarily relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and 
equipment and net operating losses.
    5.            Share based payments
   The terms and conditions of the Group's share based remuneration programmes are disclosed in the most 
recent, published, consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR3.1M in the nine months ended 
December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: EUR5.9M) is the fair value of options granted in prior periods, 
which is being recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee services rendered.  
During the period 3.0M ordinary shares were issued at a strike price between EUR6.25 and EUR6.74 per share 
following the exercise of vested options.
    6.            Contingencies
   The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -7-
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
    7.            Capital commitments
   At December 31, 2020 the Group had an operating fleet of 428 (2019: 445) Boeing 737 and 29 (2019: 23) 
Airbus A320 aircraft.
   In September 2014, the Group agreed to purchase up to 200 (100 firm and 100 options) Boeing 737-8200 
aircraft, subsequently increased to 210 (135 firm and 75 options). In December 2020, the Group increased 
its firm orders from 135 to 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft. The first Ryanair Boeing 737-8200 was due to 
deliver in April 2019. However, due to the global grounding of the MAX aircraft by EASA and the FAA in 
March 2019, the first delivery is now expected to be in Q4 FY21.
    8.            Analysis of operating segment
   The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the Group CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).
   The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the profit/(loss) after tax of each airline 
for the reporting period. Resource allocation decisions for all airlines are based on airline performance 
for the relevant period, with the objective in making these resource allocation decisions being to 
optimize consolidated financial results.
   Ryanair DAC ("Ryanair") is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Buzz, Lauda and Malta 
Air do not exceed the quantitative thresholds for reporting purposes and accordingly have been presented 
on an aggregate basis in the table below.
   There are varying levels of integration between the operating segments. Inter-segment revenue is not 
material and thus not subject to separate disclosure.
    8.            Analysis of operating segment - continued

   The Directors, having made enquiries, including consideration of ongoing cost reductions, the projected 
increase in bookings upon the widespread rollout of Covid-19 vaccines during 2021, the September 2020 
EUR1.25bn fundraising, underpinned by the Group's strong BBB rated balance sheet, the ability to raise 
additional financing at low interest rates if needed, potential additional cost preservation measures and 
EUR3.5bn gross cash at December 31, 2020, are satisfied that it remains appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements. While there is uncertainty as to the full extent of 
the impact on the Ryanair Holdings plc Group, the continued preparation of the Group's consolidated 
financial statements on the going concern basis is supported by the financial projections prepared by the 
Group.
   Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
   Interim Financial Statements
    1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies

consolidated 
interim 
financial 
statements 
("the 
interim 
financial 
statements"), which should be read in conjunction with our 2020 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 
2020, have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial

financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2020, together with the independent

General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
   The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 on January 29, 2021.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -6-
   Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
   Government grants
   Grants that compensate the Group for related expenses incurred are recognised in the income statement 
on a systematic basis in the periods in which the related expenses are recognised.
   New IFRS standards and amendments adopted during the year
   The following new and amended IFRS standards, amendments and IFRIC interpretations, have been issued by 
the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the 
Group's financial year beginning on April 1, 2020 and therefore have been applied by the Group in these 
condensed consolidated interim financial statements:
   --    Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendments to IFRS 3 - Definition of a Business (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of Material (effective for fiscal periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendment to IFRS 16 - Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions (effective for fiscal periods beginning 
on or after January 1, 2020)
   The Group has evaluated the extent to which its cashflow hedging relationships are subject to 
uncertainty driven by IBOR reform as at December 31, 2020. The Group's hedged items and hedging 
instruments continue to be indexed to EURIBOR. These benchmark rates are quoted each day and the IBOR cash 
flows are exchanged with counterparties as usual.
   The calculation methodology of EURIBOR changed during 2019. In July 2019, the Belgian Financial 
Services and Markets Authority granted authorisation with respect to EURIBOR under the European Union 
Benchmarks regulation. This allows market participants to continue to use EURIBOR for both existing and 
new contracts and the Group expects that EURIBOR will continue to exist as a benchmark for the foreseeable 
future.
   The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on the Group's financial 
position or results from operations in the quarter ended December 31, 2020.
   New IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
   The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for the purposes 
of the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable.  While under review, we do not 
anticipate that the adoption of the other new or revised standards and interpretations will have a 
material impact on our financial position or results from operations:
   --    IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2023)
   --    Amendments to IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023)
   --    Amendments to IFRS 3 - Reference to the Conceptual Framework (effective for fiscal periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2022)
   --    Amendments to IAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before Intended Use (effective 
for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022)
   --    Amendments to IAS 37 - Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022)
   --    Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2022)
    --    Amendments to IFRS 17 (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023)
   --    Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform 
(effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021)
   Statement of Cash Flows restatement
   Operating cash inflows and investing cash outflows for the nine month period ended December 31, 2019 
have been reclassified. They both have been reduced by EUR0.9bn to reflect accrued supplier payables which 
had previously been presented as capital expenditure in the consolidated cash flows.
    2.            Judgements and estimates
   The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -6-
   In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the most recent published 
consolidated financial statements.
   Derivative financial instruments
   The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, 
including the risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates. Ryanair uses 
forward contracts for the purchase of its jet fuel (jet kerosene) requirements to reduce its exposure to 
commodity price risk. It also uses foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to risks 
related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the purchase of new 
Boeing 737 aircraft and the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the purchase of jet fuel.
   The Group recognises all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in its consolidated 
balance sheet and measures them at fair value. At December 31, 2020, a net liability of EUR263M (2019 net 
asset EUR128M) was recognised on balance sheet in respect of the Group's jet fuel derivative instruments 
and a net asset of EUR68M (2019 net asset EUR334M) was recognised in respect of its foreign currency 
derivative instruments associated with future aircraft purchases.
   In determining the hedge effectiveness of derivative instruments used to hedge Ryanair's fuel 
requirements, there is significant judgement involved in assessing whether the volumes of jet fuel hedged 
are still expected to be highly probable forecast transactions. Specifically, significant judgement is 
required in respect of the assumptions related to the timing of the full removal of flight restrictions 
imposed by governments relating to the Covid-19 pandemic, the expected recovery of passenger demand and 
the subsequent flight schedules. All of these assumptions impact upon forecast fuel consumption, and minor 
changes to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
   At March 31, 2020 the Group expected to operate much of its normal Winter 2020/2021 schedule. The Group 
now believes it will operate approximately 20% of its Winter 2020/2021 schedule.

   MD&A Quarter Ended December 31, 2020
   Introduction
   For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") (with the exception of the balance sheet 
commentary below) all figures and comments are by reference to the adjusted results excluding the exceptional 
item referred to below.
   Ongoing European Government travel & flight restrictions as a result of Covid-19 means that the Group will 
operate a significantly reduced flying schedule in FY21 compared to what was originally expected. Therefore, the 
Group is recording an additional exceptional hedge ineffectiveness charge of EUR18m (net of a tax) in relation to 
FY21 jet fuel hedges and a EUR3M credit (net of a tax) in relation to ineffective currency cashflow hedges primarily 
from delayed capital expenditure.
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues decreased by 85% to EUR177.3M due to a 78% decline in traffic to 8.1M guests as 
European Governments imposed flight and/or travel restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Group operated 
approximately 30% of its normal Q3 schedule with a 70% load factor.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues decreased by 77% to EUR163.9M, marginally better than the 78% decline in traffic (as 
highlighted above) to 8.1M.
   Total Revenue:

   As a result of the above, total revenue decreased by 82% to EUR341.2M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil decreased by 78% to EUR152.4M due to a 69% reduction in sectors flown, arising from Covid-
19 fleet groundings, improved on-time performance and lower fuel burn.
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation was 25% lower at EUR142.9M, primarily due to lower amortisation as a result of reduced 
aircraft utilisation.
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs decreased 53% to EUR129.1M   due to reduced flight hours, Group wide pay cuts and 
participation in European Government payroll support schemes.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges decreased by 69% to EUR84.4M   due to lower sectors and reduced charges.
   Route charges:
   Route charges decreased by 69% to EUR55.7M in line with reduced sectors arising from Covid-19 fleet 
groundings.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other decreased by 63% to EUR51.0M due to lower discretionary spending 
across the Group airlines and fewer flights qualifying for EU261 compensation due to improved on-time 
performance in Q3 (96% OTP).
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs decreased by 11% to EUR56.7M due to reduced aircraft utilisation, 
offset by lease hand backs.
   Aircraft rentals:
   Aircraft rentals fell by 82% to EUR1.4M due to 7 fewer leased B737 aircraft in the fleet.
   Other expense:
   Net finance expense increased by EUR1.1M to EUR12.4M as a result of higher gross debt and lower deposit 
interest rates.
   MD&A Nine Months Ended December 31, 2020

   For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") (with the exception of the balance 
sheet commentary below) all figures and comments are by reference to the adjusted results excluding the 
exceptional item referred to below.
   Ongoing European Government travel & flight restrictions as a result of Covid-19 means that the Group 
will operate a significantly reduced flying schedule in FY21 compared to what was originally expected. 
Therefore, the Group is recording an exceptional hedge ineffectiveness charge of EUR183M (net of tax) in 
relation to FY21 jet fuel hedges and a EUR46M charge (net of a tax) in relation to ineffective currency 
cashflow hedges primarily related to fuel currency hedges and delayed capital expenditure.
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues decreased by 80% to EUR968.1M due to a 79% decline in traffic to 25.2M guests as 
European Governments imposed flight and/or travel restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This grounded 
approx. 99% of the Groups fleet for almost 4 months (from mid-March to late June). The Group operated 
approximately 28% of its normal nine months schedule with a 72% load factor.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues decreased by 77% to EUR549.3M due to a 79% decline in traffic (as highlighted above) 
to 25.2M offset by a strong performance in priority boarding and reserved seating.
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues decreased by 79% to EUR1,517.4M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil decreased by 78% to EUR495.4M due to a 72% reduction in sectors flown, arising from Covid-
19 fleet groundings, improved on-time performance and lower fuel burn.
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation was 23% lower at EUR439.4M   primarily due to lower amortisation as a result of reduced 
aircraft utilisation.
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs decreased by 58% to EUR363.7M due to reduced flight hours, a recruitment freeze, Group wide 
pay cuts and participation in European Government payroll support schemes.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges decreased by 73% to EUR254.1M due to lower sectors and reduced charges.
   Route charges:
   Route charges decreased by 72% to EUR171.0M in line with reduced sectors arising from Covid-19 fleet 
groundings.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other decreased by 64% to EUR157.4M due to lower discretionary spending 
across the Group airlines and fewer flights qualifying for EU261 compensation due to improved on-time 
performance (97% OTP).
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs decreased by 31% to EUR139.3M due to reduced aircraft utilisation, 
offset by lease hand backs.
   Aircraft rentals:
   Aircraft rentals fell by 82% to EUR6.2M due to 7 fewer leased B737 aircraft in the fleet.
   Other expense:
   Net finance expense decreased by EUR10.2M to EUR27.8M primarily due to the maturity of more expensive 
secured debt, offset by increased gross debt in Q3 and lower deposit interest rates.
   Balance sheet:
   Gross cash decreased by EUR317.9M to EUR3,490.1M at December 31, 2020.
   Gross debt rose by EUR1,295.9M to EUR5,507.1M primarily due to a EUR850M Eurobond issuance in September 
2020 and the drawdown of GBP600M unsecured debt under the HMT and Bank of England CCFF in April 2020, 
offset by EUR171.9M debt repayments and EUR61.2M lease liability payments. Net debt was EUR2,017.0M at 
period end.
   Shareholders' equity:
   Shareholders' equity decreased by EUR243.1M to EUR4,671.4M in the period primarily due to a net loss of 
EUR731.3M offset by a EUR400.0M equity placing in September 2020.

   Interim Management Report
   Introduction
   This financial report for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 meets the reporting requirements 
pursuant to the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and Transparency Rules of the 
Central Bank of Ireland.
   This interim management report includes the following:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
   -- Principal risks and uncertainties relating to the remaining three months of the year;
   -- Related party transactions; and
   -- Post balance sheet events.
   Results of operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the nine months ended 
December 31, 2019, including important events that occurred during the nine months, are set forth above in 
the MD&A.
   Principal risks and uncertainties for the remainder of the year
   The Covid-19 pandemic and measures to reduce its spread have had, and will likely continue to have, a 
material adverse impact on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
Since February 2020, governments globally have implemented a range of travel restrictions including 
lockdowns, "do not travel" advisories, restrictions on travel from certain international locations, 
enhanced airport screenings, mandatory quarantine requirements, mandatory pre-travel PCR test requirements 
and other similar measures. Other governmental restrictions and regulations in the future in response to 
Covid-19 could include additional travel restrictions, quarantines of additional populations (including 
the Group's personnel), restrictions on our ability to access our facilities or aircraft or requirements 
to collect additional passenger data. In addition, governments, non-governmental organizations and 
entities in the private sector have issued and may continue to issue non-binding advisories or 
recommendations regarding air travel or other social distancing measures, including limitations on the 
number of persons that should be present at public gatherings. In addition, Ryanair has incurred, and will 
continue to incur, significant Covid-19 related costs for enhanced aircraft cleaning and additional 
procedures to limit transmission among its personnel and customers. Although these procedures are 
currently elective, the industry may in the future be subject to further cleaning and safety measures, 
which may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement. These measures, individually and 
combined, could have a material adverse impact on the Group's business.
   The full extent of the ongoing impact of Covid-19 on the Group's longer-term operational and financial 
performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of the Group's control, 
including the duration and spread of Covid-19 and related travel advisories and restrictions, the impact 
of Covid-19 on overall long-term demand for air travel, the impact of Covid-19 on the financial health and 
operations of the Group's business partners (particularly Boeing), and future governmental actions 
including the roll out of Covid-19 vaccines, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
   Principal risks and uncertainties for the remainder of the year - continued
   Among other factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected 
results for the remainder of the year are the airline pricing environment, capacity growth in Europe, fuel 
costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the replacement of aircraft, costs 
associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, UK, European Union 
("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, weather related disruptions, ATC 
strikes and staffing related disruptions, continuing uncertainties surrounding Brexit, fluctuations in 
currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, the economic 
environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK, and Continental 
Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel, other economic, social and political factors and 
unforeseen security events.
   Board of Directors
   David Bonderman and Kyran McLaughlin retired from the Board on May 31, 2020. Stan McCarthy was 
appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors following David Bonderman's retirement. Details of the 
members of the Group's Board of Directors are set forth on page 17 of the Group's 2020 annual report.

Body
   As a result of the widespread grounding of aircraft due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group expects to 
operate a significantly reduced flying schedule for the year ending March 31, 2021 compared to what was 
originally expected. Accordingly, as at December 31, 2020, the Group's exposures for jet fuel and foreign 
currency were significantly reduced, causing a proportion of derivative financial instruments which 
previously qualified for hedge accounting to become ineffective, resulting in the discontinuance of 
certain cash-flow hedge arrangements. A net expense of EUR229M (net of tax) was recognised within the 
income statement for the nine months ended December 31, 2020, comprising a charge of EUR183M (net of tax) 
in respect of jet fuel exposures and a charge of EUR46M (net of tax), primarily associated with 
ineffective currency cash-flow hedges for FY21 jet fuel and delayed capital expenditure.
   A net loss of EUR15M (net of tax) was recognised within the income statement for the quarter ended 
December 31, 2020, comprising a charge of EUR18M (net of tax) in respect of jet fuel exposures and a gain 
of EUR3M (net of tax), primarily associated with ineffective currency cash-flow hedges for fiscal year 
2021 jet fuel and delayed capital expenditure. As of December 31, 2020, EUR129M (loss) is recognised in 
the cash flow reserve in respect of continuing hedges and EUR86M (gain) in respect of hedging 
relationships for which hedge accounting is no longer applied . The balance on the hedging reserve as of 
December 31, 2020 is a loss of EUR43M.
    13.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
   The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
   These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2020 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
   Fair value hierarchy
   Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
   --    Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
the Group can access at the measurement date.
   --    Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    --    Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
   Fair value estimation
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -8-
   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
   Financial instruments measured at fair value
   --    Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
   --          Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and EUA contracts: A comparison of 
the contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at December 31, 2020 
has been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
   The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, 
there were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
   Financial instruments not measured at fair value
   --          Long-term debt: The repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at December 31, 2020 to arrive 
at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
   There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the quarter ended 
December 31, 2020 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities
   The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

  *The fair value of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values due to the short-term 
nature of the instruments.
    13.           Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
   In April 2020, the Group raised GBP600M unsecured debt for general corporate purposes under the HMT and 
Bank of England CCFF.
   The Group issued senior, unsecured bonds with a face value of EUR850M in September 2020. The bond has a 
coupon rate of 2.875% and a maturity date of September 2025.
    14.          Trade payables
   In December 2020, the Group increased its firm order for Boeing 737-8200 aircraft by 75 (from 135 to 
210 units). Taking account of the revised aircraft delivery schedule and changes in the contracted timing 
of aircraft pre-delivery payments, certain aircraft pre-delivery payables were reduced with an offset in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -9-
Property, plant and equipment. In accordance with the revised delivery schedule, EUR0.2bn of trade 
payables are now due after 1 year.
    15.          Shareholders equity and shareholder returns
   In September 2020, 35.2M ordinary shares were issued via an ordinary share placing at a price of 
EUR11.35 per share generating EUR400M proceeds.
   During the nine months ended December 31, 2020, 3.1M ordinary shares were issued at a strike price 
between EUR6.25 and EUR6.74 per share following the exercise of vested options.
   There were no shareholder returns during the nine months ended December 31, 2020.
   In FY20 the Company bought back 47.2M shares at a total cost of EUR580.5M. This buyback was equivalent 
to approximately 4.2% of the Company's issued share capital at March 31, 2020.  All of these repurchased 
ordinary shares were cancelled at March 31, 2020.
   As a result of the share buybacks in the year ended March 31, 2020, share capital decreased by 47.2M 
ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR580.5M and the other undenominated capital reserve increased by 
a corresponding EUR0.3M. The other undenominated capital reserve is required to be created under Irish law 
to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
    16.          Related party transactions
   The Company's related parties comprise its subsidiaries, Directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
   There were no related party transactions in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that materially 
affected the financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no 
changes in the related party transactions described in the 2020 Annual Report that could have a material 
effect on the financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
    17.          Government grants and assistance
   During the nine months to December 31, 2020, many European countries in which the Ryanair Group 
operates made available payroll support schemes. The Group utilised a number of these employment retention 
schemes to protect jobs within the Group. These schemes were a mix of short term Covid-19 specific 
programmes and long term schemes linked to social security that existed pre Covid-19. The total amount of 
payroll supports received by the Group under the various schemes amounted to approximately EUR66M and are 
offset against staff costs in the Consolidated Income Statement.
   In April 2020, the Group raised GBP600M unsecured (12 months) debt for general corporate purposes under 
the HMT and Bank of England CCFF. The 0.44% interest rate was the prevailing rate for strong BBB rated 
companies .
    18.          Post balance sheet events
   On January 7, 2021 the Group announced that it expects the latest Covid-19 lockdowns and travel 
restrictions in Ireland, the UK and other EU countries to materially reduce its flight schedules and 
traffic forecast through Q4 FY21. These new cut backs will reduce FY21 traffic forecasts from previously 
"below 35M" to between 26M to 30M passengers.
    19.          Going concern
   Due to its ongoing cost reductions, the projected increase in bookings upon the widespread rollout of 
Covid-19 vaccines during 2021, the September 2020 EUR1.25bn fundraising, underpinned by the Group's strong 
BBB rated balance sheet, the ability to raise additional financing at low interest rates if needed, 
potential additional cost preservation measures and EUR3.5bn gross cash at December 31, 2020 the Board are 
satisfied that it remains appropriate to adopt the going concern concept.

or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Holding(s) in Company -2-
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   RYANAIR CUTS FULL YEAR (TO MAR 21) TRAFFIC FORECAST FROM "BELOW 35M" TO "BELOW 30M" AS NEW COVID 
LOCKDOWNS & TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ANNOUNCED BY IRISH & UK GOVTS
   Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, today (Thurs 7(th) Jan) briefed the markets that it now expects the 
newly announced Covid lockdowns in Ireland, the UK, and a small number of other EU countries this week, 
will materially reduce its flight schedules and traffic forecast through Jan, Feb & Mar. Ryanair now 
expects its Jan traffic to fall to under 1.25m passengers, and that new Covid restrictions could also 
reduce Feb and Mar traffic to as little as 500,000 passengers each month. In response, Ryanair will 
significantly cut its flight schedules from Thurs 21 Jan, which will result in few, if any, flights being 
operated to/from Ireland or the UK from the end of Jan until such time as these draconian travel 
restrictions are removed. All customers affected by these further flight cancellations and further travel 
restrictions will receive emails advising them of their entitlements of free moves and/or refunds later 
today.
   These new cutbacks will reduce full year (FY March '21) traffic forecast from currently "below 35m" to 
between 26m to 30m passengers. Ryanair does not expect these flight cuts and further traffic reductions 
will materially affect its net loss for the year to 31 March 2021 since many of these flights would have 
been loss making.
   Ryanair calls on the Irish and UK Governments to accelerate the slow pace of vaccine rollouts, and in 
particular, calls on the Irish Government to explain why Denmark, with a population of 5m, has vaccinated 
40,000 citizens by Wed 6(th) Jan, whereas Ireland with a similar 5m pop., has vaccinated just 4,000, a 
vaccination rate that is 10 times slower than that of Denmark.
   A Spokesperson for Ryanair said:
   "The WHO have previously confirmed that Governments should do everything possible to avoid brutal 
lockdowns, because lockdowns "do not get rid of the virus". Ireland's Covid-19 travel restrictions are 
already the most stringent in Europe, and so these new flight restrictions are inexplicable and 
ineffective when Ireland continues to operate an open border between the Republic and the North of 
Ireland. Since Ireland's third lockdown will not get rid of the Covid virus, there is an onus on the Irish  
Government to accelerate the rollout of vaccines, and the fact that the Danish Government, with a similar 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CUTS FULL YEAR TRAFFIC FORECAST TO < 30M
5m population, has already vaccinated 10 times more citizens than Ireland shows that emergency action is 
needed to speed Covid vaccinations in Ireland.
   NPHET (Ireland's Public Health Team), which we believe has mismanaged many aspects of Ireland's Covid 
response (face masks, test & trace, international travel, care homes and meat factories), should now 
release a daily report of the number of vaccines administered in Ireland, and explain why they continue to 
run behind the vaccination rates of other similar sized EU countries. Vaccinations rather than lockdowns 
is the way out of this Covid-19 crisis, and the sooner NPHET takes action to accelerate Ireland's vaccine 
rollout speed, the better."

   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or

another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.

   Ryanair Holdings PLC
   29 December 2020
   RYANAIR RESTRICTS NON-EU VOTING RIGHTS
   TO PROTECT ITS EU AIRLINE LICENCES POST-BREXIT
   As previously advised ( https://investor.ryanair.com/brexit/ ) and announced by Ryanair Holdings PLC 
(the "Company") on 11 March 2019, the Company must take steps to ensure that it (and therefore its 
subsidiary EU airlines) will remain majority EU owned and controlled following Brexit. This is necessary 
to ensure continued compliance with the airline ownership and control requirements of EU Regulation 
1008/2008.
   In accordance with the resolutions passed by the Board of the Company on 8 March 2019, with effect from 
the date on which UK nationals cease to qualify as nationals of Member States for the purposes of Article 
4 of EU Regulation 1008/2008, being 1 January 2021 (the "Effective Date"), all Ordinary Shares and 
Depositary Shares held by or on behalf of non-EU nationals (including UK nationals) will be treated as 
"Restricted Shares" (within the meaning of the Articles of Association).
   Restricted Share Notices will be issued to the registered holder(s) of each Restricted Share in due 
course, specifying that the holder(s) of such shares shall not be entitled to attend, speak or vote at any 
general meeting of the Company for so long as those shares are treated as Restricted Shares pursuant to 
Article 41(J)(i) of the Articles of Association. Notwithstanding the powers vested in the chairman of 
general meetings of the Company pursuant to Article 41(J)(i) of the Articles of Association, the chairman 
will not vote any Restricted Shares at any meeting of the Company.
   These resolutions will remain in place until the Board of the Company determines that the ownership and 
control of the Company is no longer such that there is any risk to the airline licences held by the 
Company's subsidiaries pursuant to EU Regulation 1008/2008.
   For the avoidance of doubt:
   --          the prohibition on non-EU nationals acquiring Ordinary Shares in the Company, as announced 
by the Company on 5 February 2002, continues to apply. Consequently, with effect from the Effective Date, 
UK nationals (like all other non-EU nationals) will not be permitted to acquire Ordinary Shares in the 
Company;
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR RESTRICTS NON-EU VOTING RIGHTS POST-BREXIT
   --          UK nationals will not be required to sell any Ordinary Shares which they owned prior to the 
Effective Date but such shareholders will lose the right to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting 
of the Company in respect of those Ordinary Shares pursuant to Article 41(J)(i) of the Company's Articles 
of Association; and
   --          for these purposes, a non-EU national means a national of any jurisdiction which is not 
considered to be a "Member State" for the purposes of Article 4 of EU Regulation 1008/2008 (as amended 
from time to time), including the member states of the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and 
Liechtenstein.

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring 
temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
of Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person 
or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or 
legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity who has a life interest in shares if that

or legal entity who is disposing of the voting rights when the life interest is created;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or

Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;

Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].

presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Holding(s) in Company -2-
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.

   In our view, Just Eat's share price has not recognised the permanent benefit that the pandemic has brought to the 
business due to the acceleration of user adoption. This is partly as the company surprised investors by announcing 
in June the acquisition of US food delivery company Grubhub. The deal creates a wider range of possible 
outcomes, though we feel that few positive scenarios are being discounted. By acquiring Grubhub, Just Eat is 
effectively doubling its addressable market by issuing only 30% of its equity. CEO Jitse Groen has a strong record 
in leveraging profitable market positions to expand aggressively in markets where its competitors have weaker 
foundations. Groen owns 10% of the company and so we feel he is incentivised to make decisions for the benefit of 
shareholders. We have used periods of share price weakness to increase our holding.
   Our retail (10.2%) holdings in Frasers Group and Dixons Carphone performed well during the period. The crisis 
has asymmetrically impacted weaker players who are unlikely to emerge as effective competition. Frasers is 
continuing to build leading platforms in luxury and sportswear retail, which we think are two fundamentally attractive 
sub-segments of retail. The pandemic has provided it with the opportunity to acquire DW Sports and build a stake in 
Mulberry. The company's full year results in August demonstrated its resilience as it grew earnings, despite seeing 
the impact of lockdown for two months of the year. Dixons' core performance has been strong as it has successfully 
retained sales that shifted online and grown its share. In September, the group confirmed that revenues for the first 
three months of its financial year were up 12% in UK electricals and 16% in international electricals, with online 
growing at over 120% and now accounting for 42% of group sales.
   UK housebuilding (9.9%) is the sector in which we were most active during the period. We have increased our 
holding in Redrow , built a new position in Bellway and maintained our position in Springfield . We view 
housebuilding as an attractive recovery sector as demand is inelastic and dictated by demographics. A deficit in 
supply exists due to a decade of under-building. The market seems to have forgotten that in 2009, despite a historic 
contraction in mortgage supply and rise in unemployment, UK house prices did not fall. In addition to these existing 
structural tailwinds, the sector is currently benefitting from behavioural changes from the virus as consumers place 
a higher weighting on quality of life and therefore on the value of housing. These trends have been demonstrated 
by record order books. Despite a range of positive indicators, housebuilders' valuations have been depressed, 
creating in our view an opportunity for strong future returns.
Artemis Alpha Trust PLC Half-year Report -2-
   In past reports we outlined the rationale for holding easyJet and Ryanair (9.9%), despite the airline sector facing 
significant short term headwinds. Over the summer months, even with unpredictable government restrictions, 
European airlines achieved high load factors, which in our view demonstrates the continued desire to travel and 
likely growing pent-up demand. easyJet's share price has significantly underperformed other low cost carriers Wizz 
Air and Ryanair. In our view, the company's cost base and balance sheet flexibility are misunderstood. We 
increased our holding substantially at prices that we believe represent buying Airbus planes at a discount, with a 
franchise that is the second largest airline in Europe in for free.
   Banks (8.7%) tend not to fare well in recessions and face headwinds from a low interest rate environment. 
However, if it is widely accepted that the crisis has accelerated digitalisation, then in our view the potential benefits 
of lower costs for banks, for example by closing branches, seem to be overlooked. In recent months, we think it has 
also been increasingly clear that banks will suffer a lower impairment cycle than is typical in a recession of this 
severity. That will come from a combination of low interest rates, government loans and employment support. We 
made additions to our holding in Lloyd's and remain optimistic about the sector's potential return, given current low 
valuations and high capital ratios.
   Dignity (8.0%) was our single largest contributor and is currently our top position. The company's share price 
responded positively to the conclusion of the Competition Markets Authority's (CMA) review of the sector. The 
primary outcome is the implementation of "sunlighting" to increase transparency of prices and services offered by 
funeral and crematoria operators. The secondary outcome is greater monitoring of back-of-house services provided 
by operators. Due to the exceptional circumstances of COVID, the CMA stopped short of implementing any price 
caps, although this option remains on the table. We continue to believe that Dignity is well-positioned to succeed 
and deliver value for all stakeholders in an environment of greater transparency and regulation. We think its unique 
market position, as an owner of a national network of crematoria and funeral homes with a substantial pre-need 
business, provides a solid foundation to create significant value over the long term.
   Plus500 (6.3%), the financial trading platform, has benefited from elevated volatility. In H1 2020, the company 
acquired 198,000 customers, and grew profits nearly four-fold. The business has a strong balance sheet (over 
$600m in net cash) with which to invest in future growth.
   We established a new position in EssilorLuxottica (3.4%) in recent months, our largest single investment in the 
period. The company is the global market leader in optical lens and frames, following the merger of Essilor and 
Luxottica in 2018. The combined business is the only vertically integrated participant in the eyewear market with 
unrivalled scale: its R&D expense is larger than the rest of the industry combined. The market for eyewear is 
attractive due to the duration and consistency of growth. Myopia is increasing due to screen usage. Presbyopia is a 
function of aging demographic. Similar to the funeral industry, we will all be customers one day. Overall, the 
eyewear industry should be growing at c.4% per annum and predictably for several decades.
   Dysfunctional corporate governance has meant that the two businesses took longer to integrate than first 
expected. In time, the delivery of synergies should result in higher revenue growth and improved margins. The 
company's share price declined as it was adversely affected by lockdowns; but we expect demand to recover 
reasonably quickly as prescription lenses account for c.80% of the business.
   Fevertree (2.5%), a holding purchased earlier in the calendar year, has performed well as it has a stronger off-
trade (e.g. grocery) presence than its peers; and its strategy in the US has started to gain traction with growth 
accelerating in spite of COVID headwinds.
   IWG (4.5%), the serviced office provider, has been more resilient in the downturn than many expected. The 
company stands to benefit from the likely increase in demand arising from the pandemic for decentralised flexible 
workspace solutions. The business has over 3,000 centres, of which the majority are located outside city-centres, in 
contrast to its competitors who are focused on urban locations. The fundraising completed earlier in the year means 
that the company has net cash on its balance sheet (ex-leases), meaning it is well positioned to be a consolidator in 
the sector. We continue to believe that the pursuit of a capital-light franchising strategy has the potential to deliver 
significant returns to shareholders.
   Reaction Engines (3.7% - unlisted), the aerospace technology company, announced an investment from Rolls-
Royce and Baillie Gifford at a price higher than our current valuation. We have made no changes to our valuation 
given certain criteria used to evaluate materiality; but note the positive development, which should accelerate 
commercialisation of the company's technology.
   We are attracted to GlaxoSmithKline (3.6%) primarily due to the quality of its vaccines and consumer healthcare 
divisions, which collectively account for the majority of earnings. Consumer staple peers have re-rated substantially 
Artemis Alpha Trust PLC Half-year Report -2-
and we expect GSK to benefit from a re-rating as the planned spin-off of this division in 2022 draws nearer. The 
vaccines industry should see a structural boost from COVID and GSK is the largest vaccine-maker globally. Whilst 
the market value of vaccine-makers has increased by over $100bn year to date, GSK's market value declined by 
$27bn (22%). We used share price weakness to add to our holding.
   Capital & Counties (CapCo) (2.8%) was our largest single detractor, declining by 37%. The recovery of activity in 
city centres from lockdown has been weak and international travel (accounting for c.40% of Covent Garden's traffic) 
remains restricted. In May, the company used its unlevered balance sheet following the disposal of Earl's Court in 
2019 to acquire 27% of its peer, Shaftesbury. We like this acquisition as it was opportunistic. Shaftesbury is a 
unique asset, and there are potential synergies from a merger, as the two estates are adjoining in parts. At the 
current share price of 105p, the Covent Garden assets are valued at less than GBP1,000 per square foot. Even in 
negative scenarios where we assume significant rent reductions, we see limited downside - and so we added to our 
position. In a more likely scenario, we think traffic will recover given the enduring attraction of the area, which 
should provide value for tenants in a world where consumers increasingly demand experiential retail.

   (the "Company")
   IMPORTANT COVID-19 NOTICE
   Updated arrangements for the Extraordinary General Meeting ("EGM")
   to be held at 9.00 am on Thursday, 17 December 2020
   Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") today announces that as the current COVID-19 measures published by 
the Government of Ireland provide that no organised indoor gatherings should take place, and to prioritise 
the health and safety of our shareholders, employees and other stakeholders, the Board is advising that 
regrettably it will not be possible for shareholders or any other persons (including members of the press) 
to attend the EGM in person.
   Although shareholders are not able to attend the EGM in person, shareholder participation and 
engagement remains important to us. The Board is therefore strongly encouraging all shareholders to:
    --    submit a proxy form by no later than 9.00 am on Tuesday, 15 December 2020; and
   --    appoint the Chairman of the meeting as their proxy rather than a named person to ensure they can 
exercise their vote and be represented at the EGM without attending in person.
   Proxy forms can be submitted in advance of the EGM by availing of one of the following options:
   --          By post to the Company's Registrar, Link Registrars Limited, PO Box 1110, Maynooth, Co. 
Kildare, Ireland or by hand to Link Registrars Limited, Level 2, Block C, Maynooth Business Campus, 
Maynooth, Co. Kildare, W23 F854, Ireland.
    --          By fax to +353 (1) 2240700, provided it is received in legible form.
    --          Electronically by accessing www.signalshares.com.
    --          Via the CREST System, where shares are held in CREST.
   Shareholders may submit questions relating to the business of the meeting in advance (so as to be 
received by no later than 9.00 am on Wednesday, 16 December 2020) by email to EGM2020@Ryanair.com or by 
post to the Company's registered office, marked for the attention of the Company Secretary. All 
correspondence should include sufficient information to identify the shareholder on the Register of 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Updated arrangements for the EGM 17 December 2020
Members. The Company will endeavour to respond to relevant questions by posting a response on the 
Company's website.
   As the situation is evolving and the Irish Government's guidance may change, shareholders are 
encouraged to check the website of the Company for any further updates regarding the EGM at 
https://investor.ryanair.com/ .

lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or

date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.

indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].

presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Holding(s) in Company -2-
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   Ryanair Holdings PLC
   03 December 2020
   RYANAIR ORDERS 75 BOEING MAX-8200 AIRCRAFT (210 IN TOTAL)
   DELIVERIES START EARLY IN 2021 AND RUN UNTIL DEC. 2024
   VALUE OF 210 x 737 FIRM ORDER EXCEEDS $22 BILLION
   Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, today (3 Dec. 2020) signed a purchase agreement with Boeing for 75 
new MAX-8200 aircraft, which increases its firm order for the Boeing "Gamechanger" aircraft from 135 to 
210, with a total value of over $22bn. Now that the Boeing MAX aircraft has been certified by the FAA to 
return to service, Ryanair expects to take the first deliveries of these new fuel efficient and 
environmentally friendly aircraft from early 2021, and has confirmed 210 firm orders with Boeing for these 
gamechanger aircraft, which will be delivered over a 4-year period between Spring 2021 and December 2024.
   Ryanair, which (prior to the Covid-19 crisis) was on track to carry over 150m passengers last year, 
will use these new aircraft to grow its low fare services into new EU countries and markets, which will 
incentivize Europe's consumers and its travel industry to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, as quickly 
as multiple vaccines are rolled out in 2021, and life returns to normal. Ryanair and Boeing have agreed 
revised delivery dates, and have also agreed compensation for the direct costs incurred by Ryanair over 
the past 18 months due to these delivery delays, although some of this compensation has been factored into 
a modest reduction in the pricing of this new aircraft order which has encouraged Ryanair to increase the 
firm order from 135 to 210 aircraft.
   The Boeing 737 MAX-8200 aircraft is a "Gamechanger" for Ryanair's customers and Europe's consumers. 
This aircraft, when delivered, will be the most audited, most regulated in aviation history. The aircraft 
performance is exceptional, as it delivers 8 more seats per flight, yet burns 16% less fuel, and lowers 
noise emissions by 40%. This new 197 seat Boeing aircraft is the perfect sized platform to allow Ryanair 
expand and grow its low fare services across Europe over the next decade. This new Boeing order helps 
Ryanair to lower its cost base and return to growth across Europe in 2021, by delivering lower fares to 
customers, as well as a lower CO2 and noise footprint, making Ryanair Europe's greenest, cleanest airline, 
and helping Ryanair reach its target of being carbon neutral by 2050.
   Boeing's President & CEO Dave Calhoun said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYR ORDERS 75 BOEING MAX-8200 AIRCRAFT (210 TOTAL)
   "Ryanair will continue to play a leading role in our industry when Europe recovers from the Covid-19 
pandemic and air traffic returns to growth across the continent. We are gratified that Ryanair is once 
again placing its confidence in the Boeing 737 family and building their future fleet with this enlarged 
firm order.
   Boeing remains focused on safely returning the full 737 fleet to service and on delivering the backlog 
of airplanes to Ryanair and our other customers in the new year. We firmly believe in this airplane and we 
will continue the work to re-earn the trust of all of our customers."
   Ryanair's Group CEO Michael O'Leary said:
   "We are pleased and proud to place this enlarged order with Boeing, who have successfully completed the 
return to service of the Boeing MAX aircraft. The Boeing MAX is a fabulous aircraft with more seats, more 
leg room, lower fares, lower fuel consumption, and it sets incredible environmental standards, including 
40% less noise and lower CO2 emissions.
   We hope to take delivery of at least 50 of these aircraft in 2021, subject to Boeing recovering its 
manufacturing output to deliver them. For as long as the Covid-19 pandemic depresses air travel, we will 
use these new aircraft to replace some of our older Boeing NG fleet, which will remain  grounded until 
pre-Covid demand returns. But as soon as the Covid-19 virus recedes - and it will in 2021 with the rollout 
of multiple effective vaccines - Ryanair and our partner airports across Europe will - with these 
environmentally efficient aircraft - rapidly restore flights and schedules, recover lost traffic and help 
the nations of Europe recover their tourism industry, and get young people back to work across the cities, 
beaches, and ski resorts of the EU.
   We sincerely thank our partners in Boeing, who have worked closely with us over the last 18 months to 
reschedule aircraft deliveries, to provide fair compensation to reflect those costs which Ryanair has 
incurred through these delivery delays and to agree this new enlarged aircraft order. We are working 
closely with Boeing and our senior pilot professionals to assist our regulator EASA to certify these 
aircraft in Europe, and to complete the training of our pilots and crews across our 3 new Boeing MAX 
simulators in Dublin and Stansted.
   We are extremely grateful to our shareholders who have recently supported a EUR1.25 billion 
fundraising, without which we could not have placed this large but very timely aircraft order during a 
once in a century downturn in the airline industry. We believe our people will enjoy flying these exciting 
new aircraft, which will, we hope, allow us to recruit/train many thousands of new pilots and cabin crew 
over the next 5 years. The Board and people of Ryanair are confident that our customers will love these 
new aircraft, they will enjoy the new interiors, the more generous leg room, the lower fuel consumption 
and the quieter noise performance, but most of all, they will love the lower fares, which these aircraft 
will enable Ryanair to offer not just in 2021, but for the next decade, as Ryanair leads a strong recovery 
of Europe's aviation and tourism industry out of the 2020 Covid-19 crisis."

Body
   Thirdly, the manager invested in a handful of companies where near-term demand looks bleak. A position 
in Booking Holdings, the online travel agency, was established in the period and has since been increased. 
On a long-term view the manager believes that Booking is in a position of strength relative to peers, is 
well placed to take market share in the US and to take a growing share of its customers' spending by 
providing ancillary services like car hire and travel insurance. Another new holding, Lyft, is a ride-
hailing application which is in its infancy. Whilst its operating environment is challenging now, Lyft has 
the potential to grow the transportation-as-a-service market and change the way transportation assets are 
owned and run. Monks' position in Ryanair, the low-cost airline, has twice been increased in the period, 
underpinned by the belief that the company is well placed to take market share whilst others retrench. Its 
relentless focus on efficiency affords the business a much higher tolerance of challenging operating 
conditions. Ryanair should emerge from the crisis stronger than it entered it. Finally, positions in 
adidas (sports apparel) and Estée Lauder (cosmetics) have been added to the portfolio. The manager 
believes that both these businesses possess brands which will endure this challenging period to grow 
successfully, particularly in Asia, over the coming years.
   The manager guards against complacency by continuing to assess the prospects of the portfolio holdings. 
Action has been taken where prospects fail to meet their hurdle rate (a doubling in the share price over 5 
years). This has been the case with a handful of holdings which failed to take advantage of their growth 
opportunity. This includes Signify, which has struggled in its transition towards LED lighting, and 
Distribution Now, in not proactively consolidating the distribution market for parts and consumables to 
industrial sectors in the US. Elsewhere, capital allocation has proven a headache at Kirby Corporation, a 
US barge business. Despite a successful inland Marine Services operation which transports oil and 
petrochemicals throughout canals and waterways of south east America, management has consistently 
allocated capital to its failing engine services business. Valuation remains an important discipline and 
there have been some instances where this has driven sales from the portfolio. Chief in this regard is 
Visa, the digital payments business and Chipotle, the Tex-Mex fast food chain, which has excelled in 
turning around its fortunes in recent years but where the manager feels that future growth is fully 
reflected in the share price.
   Gearing
   The level of invested gearing at the period end stood at 3.2%, compared to 6.5% six months earlier, 
having fallen on account of continued strong performance and a reduction in short-term borrowing. It is 
expected that gearing will be maintained in the range of minus 15% to plus 15%, with the intention of plus 
10% as a long-term neutral position. The Company undertook a private placement capital raise in August, 
Monks Investment Trust PLC Half-year Report -2-
successfully raising GBP100m in two tranches with an average duration of 30 years and coupon of 1.8%. We 
believe this to be an attractive cost of borrowing and are confident that future long-term returns are 
likely to be significantly in excess of this level.
   Dividend
   No interim dividend is being paid. A single final dividend will typically be paid after the AGM, 
reflecting the Company's focus on capital growth.
   Current Positioning and Outlook
   Monks retains a tried and tested investment approach which centres on bottom-up stock picking and an 
ability to invest in growth companies anywhere in the world. Indeed, the manager undertakes regular 
thematic reviews of the Monks portfolio, the most recent of which highlights a proliferating and 
reassuringly diverse range of underlying exposures (see below). This established approach has supported a 
calm and measured response to the developments of recent months and has allowed Monks to make modest 
changes to position itself for future growth. Inherent in this is a desire to invest in companies run by 
management teams who are sensible stewards of capital and are capable of navigating and adapting to what 
the future brings. This is what underpins our confidence about Monks' prospects for the future and 
optimism about the opportunities that lie ahead.
   The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company are set out in note 14.

   The Managers' Core Investment Beliefs
   We believe the following features of Monks provide a sustainable basis for adding value for 
shareholders.
   Active Management
   3/4 We invest in attractive companies using a 'bottom-up' investment process. Macroeconomic forecasts 
are of relatively little interest to us.
   3/4 High active share* provides the potential for adding value.
   3/4 We ignore the structure of the index - for example the location of a company's HQ and therefore its 
domicile are less relevant to us than where it generates sales and profits.
   3/4 Large swathes of the market are unattractive and of no interest to us.
   3/4 As index agnostic global investors we can go anywhere and only invest in the best ideas.
   3/4 As the portfolio is very different from the index, we expect portfolio returns to vary - sometimes 
substantially and often for prolonged periods.
   Committed Growth Investors
   3/4 In the long run, share prices follow fundamentals; growth drives returns.
   3/4 We aim to produce a portfolio of stocks with above average growth - this in turn underpins the 
ability of Monks to add value.
   3/4 We have a differentiated approach to growth, focusing on the type of growth that we expect a 
company to deliver. All holdings fall into one of four growth categories - as set out in the Investment 
Portfolio by Growth Category table below.
   3/4 The use of these four growth categories ensures a diversity of growth drivers within a disciplined 
framework.
   Long-Term Perspective
   3/4 Long-term holdings mean that company fundamentals are given time to drive returns.
   3/4 We prefer companies that are managed with a long-term mindset, rather than those that prioritise 
the management of market expectations.
   3/4 We believe our approach helps us focus on what is important during the inevitable periods of 
underperformance.
   3/4 Short-term portfolio results are random.
   3/4 As longer-term shareholders we are able to have greater influence on environmental, social and 
governance matters.
   Dedicated Team with Clear Decision-making Process
   3/4 Senior and experienced team drawing on the full resources of Baillie Gifford.
   3/4 Alignment of interests - the investment team responsible for Monks all own shares in the Company.
   Portfolio Construction
Monks Investment Trust PLC Half-year Report -2-
   3/4 Investments are held in three broad holding sizes - as set out in the Investment Portfolio by 
Growth Category table below.
   3/4 This allows us to back our judgement in those stocks for which we have greater conviction, and to 
embrace the asymmetry of returns through 'incubator' positions in higher risk/return stocks.
   3/4 'Asymmetry of returns': some of our smaller positions will struggle and their share prices will 
fall; those that are successful may rise many fold. The latter should outweigh the former.
   Low Cost
   3/4 Investors should not be penalised by high management fees.
   3/4 Low turnover and trading costs benefit shareholders.

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring

Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or

   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].
   (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be 
presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   Ryanair Holdings plc
   (the "Company")
   NOTICE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING
   An Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company will be held at Ryanair Dublin Office, Airside Business 
Park, Swords, Co. Dublin, K67 NY94, Ireland on Thursday 17 December 2020 at 9.00 a.m. ("EGM").
   The business of the EGM will be to consider and, if thought fit, approve certain resolutions relating 
to the replacement of CREST with a system operated by Euroclear Bank SA/NV for the electronic settlement 
of trading in the Company's ordinary shares ("Resolutions").  Approval of the Resolutions is necessary to 
ensure the Company's shares can continue to be settled electronically when they are traded on Euronext 
Dublin and the London Stock Exchange and remain eligible for continued admission to trading and listing on 
those exchanges, which is crucial to the interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.
   The circular which includes the notice of the EGM (the "Circular") and a Form of Proxy have been posted 
to shareholders today.  The Board strongly urges shareholders to review the contents of the Circular in 
their entirety, including the documents referred to therein, and consider the Board's recommendation to 
vote in favour of the Resolutions.
   The Circular, the Form of Proxy and copies of the documents referred to in the Circular are available 
to view on the Company's website, https://investor.ryanair.com/ , and will be available for inspection 
during normal business hours on any business day from the date of this letter until the EGM at the 
registered office of the Company.
   Public Health Guidelines and the EGM
   The well-being of shareholders and employees is a primary concern for the Directors. We are closely 
monitoring the COVID-19 situation and will take all recommendations and applicable law into account in the 
conduct of the EGM.  There will likely be very limited ability to attend the EGM in person and the Board 
therefore strongly encourages shareholders to appoint the chairman of the EGM as a proxy by submitting a 
proxy form not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the EGM or any adjournment thereof, in 
order to ensure they can exercise their vote and be represented at the EGM without attending in person.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of EGM
   Proxy forms can be submitted in advance of the EGM by availing of one of the options set out in the 
notice of the EGM:
   --           by post to the Company's registrar, Link Registrars Limited, PO Box 1110, Maynooth, Co. 
Kildare, Ireland or by hand to Link Registrars Limited, Level 2, Block C, Maynooth Business Campus, 
Maynooth, Co. Kildare, W23 F854, Ireland;
    --           by fax to +353 (1) 2240700, provided it is received in legible form;
    --           electronically by accessing www.signalshares.com;
    --           via the CREST System, where shares are held in CREST.
   Any relevant updates regarding the EGM, including any changes to the arrangements outlined in the 
Circular, 
will 
be 
announced 
via 
a 
Regulatory 
Information 
Service 
and 
will 
be 
available 
on 
https://investor.ryanair.com/.
   In the event that it is not possible to hold the EGM either in compliance with public health guidelines 
or applicable law or where it is otherwise considered that proceeding with the EGM as planned poses an 
unacceptable health and safety risk, the EGM may be adjourned or postponed or relocated to a different 
time and/or venue, in which case notification of such adjournment or postponement or relocation will be 
given in accordance with applicable law.
   Further information in relation to the EGM
   In accordance with Irish Listing Rule 6.1.59 and UK Listing Rule 14.3.6, the Circular and the Articles 
of Association of the Company in the proposed amended form will be submitted to the Irish Stock Exchange 
t/a Euronext Dublin and the UK's National Storage Mechanism and will be available for inspection at the 
following locations:
   Companies Announcement Office
   Euronext Dublin

   Important Note
   Announcements relating to the EGM contain (or may contain) certain forward-looking statements with 
respect to certain of the Company's current expectations and projections about future events, including 
Migration, and the Company's future financial condition and performance.  These statements, which 
sometimes use words such as "aim", "anticipate", "believe", "may", "will", "should", "intend", "plan", 
"assume", "estimate", "expect" (or the negative thereof) and words of similar meaning, reflect the 
directors' current beliefs and expectations and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and 
assumptions, many of which are outside the Company's control and difficult to predict (certain of which 
are set out in the Circular with respect to Migration).
   Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-
looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.  In light of these risks, uncertainties and 
assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements in this announcement may not occur.  
The information contained in this announcement, including the forward-looking statements, speaks only as 
of the date of this announcement and is subject to change without notice and the Company does not assume 
any responsibility or obligation to, and does not intend to, update or revise publicly or review any of 
the information contained herein save where indicated in the Circular, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by Euronext Dublin, the Central 
Bank of Ireland, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the London Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Stock Market, 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or by applicable law.
   The defined terms set out in Part 9 of the Circular have the same meaning herein.

   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty

suspended.

   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.

   COVID-19:
   Covid-19 grounded the Group's entire fleet from mid-March to the end of June as EU Govts imposed flight or 
travel bans and widespread population lockdowns.  During this crisis, Group airlines repatriated customers and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report
operated rescue flights for many EU Govts.  The Group implemented extensive health measures, especially 
onboard aircraft, to comply with EU guidelines (ECDC & EASA) and on 1 July successfully resumed flights across 
most of our route network operating up to 60% of prior year capacity in Q2 achieving over 70% load factors.  
Passenger confidence and forward bookings into W.20 were negatively impacted by the return of uncoordinated EU 
Govt flight restrictions in Sep. and Oct. which heavily curtailed travel to/from much of Central Europe, the UK, 
Ireland, Austria, Belgium and Portugal.  As a result, Ryanair recently cut its FY21 traffic guidance to approx. 38m 
guests. This takes the Group's W.20 (Nov-Mar) capacity down from the previously guided 60% to at most 40% of 
prior year traffic.
   Ryanair's Customer Service teams (supported by Ryanair Labs) have cleared an unprecedented volume of 
customer flight changes and Covid-19 cancellations, while processing a record backlog of refunds caused by 
almost 4 months of EU Govt imposed flight cancellations.  This process was frustrated by unlicensed OTAs, many 
of who provided false customer contact and fake payment details at the time of booking.  Despite the enormity of 
the task, almost all non-OTA refund requests have now been dealt with either via cash refunds or vouchers.
   The Covid-19 crisis has already caused the closure of a number of EU airlines including Flybe, Germanwings and 
Level as well as deep long-term capacity reductions at many others.  It has sparked a flood of illegal State Aid from 
EU Governments to their flag carriers including Alitalia, Air France/KLM, LOT, Lufthansa, SAS, TAP and others.  
This illegal State Aid will distort competition and allow failed flag carriers to engage in below cost selling for many 
years.  We expect intra-European air travel capacity to remain subdued for the next few years. This will create 
opportunities for Ryanair (Europe's lowest cost airline) to grow its network, and expand its fleet, to take advantage 
of lower cost airport and aircraft opportunities that will inevitably arise.
   H1 BUSINESS REVIEW:
   Revenue & Costs
   Revenue fell by 78% to EUR1.18bn as traffic fell 80% to 17.1m.  With almost zero Q1 traffic, the vast majority of 
H1 revenue was earned in Q2.  Ancillary revenue performed strongly as more guests chose priority boarding and 
reserved seating.
   During the half-year substantial work has been undertaken to successfully improve Ryanair's long term cost 
leadership.  The Group has agreed modest pay cuts with our people and their unions which helped minimise job 
losses. Lauda has been completely restructured, better terms were agreed with our maintenance providers, lessors, 
marketing & other suppliers and many airport deals were renegotiated.  Our Route Development teams are working 
with airports partners across Europe who have suffered steep traffic declines and discussions are ongoing with 
aircraft suppliers to amend pricing to reflect the new Covid-19 reality.  Due to significantly reduced W.20 traffic 
forecasts and ongoing aircraft delivery delays, the Group recorded a EUR214m ineffectiveness charge on fuel and 
currency hedges in H1.
   Balance Sheet & Liquidity
   Ryanair's balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry with a BBB credit rating (S&P and Fitch) and over 
EUR4.5bn cash at 30 Sep. Almost 80% of the Group's fleet is unencumbered (with a book value of over EUR7bn). 
Since March, the Group lowered cash burn by cutting costs, participating in EU Govt payroll support schemes, 
cancelling share buybacks and deferring non-essential capex.  In Sep., the Group raised EUR400m of equity and a 
5-year (unsecured) EUR850m eurobond with a 2.875% coupon (both transactions were multiple times 
oversubscribed and keenly priced).  Cash was also boosted by EUR250m supplier reimbursements received in Q2. 
This ensures that the Group is well financed to deal with the Covid-19 crisis and removes refinancing risk as it 
prepares to repay maturing debt over the coming year (CCFF GBP600m in Mar. & EUR850m bond in Jun. 2021).  
This financial strength enables the Group to capitalise on the many growth opportunities that are available post 
Covid-19.
   Boeing MAX update
   It is over 18-months since the Group was due to take delivery of its first Boeing 737-MAX-200 aircraft.  Boeing 
expect a calendar Q4 return to service for the MAX-8, allowing Ryanair to, hopefully, accept delivery of its first 
MAX-200 in early 2021.  We expect to take delivery of approx. 30 MAXs before peak S.2021. While the Group 
received supplier reimbursements in Q2, compensation discussions will not be finalised or concluded with Boeing 
until the MAX returns to service and revised delivery schedules can be finalised and agreed.  We remain committed 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report
to the Boeing 737, particularly the new 200 series "gamechanger" aircraft which have 4% more seats, 16% lower 
fuel burn and 40% lower noise emissions.  These new aircraft will enable Ryanair to grow to 200m passengers p.a. 
over the next 5 or 6 years while lowering the cost base and significantly reducing its environmental footprint.
   BREXIT:
   The risk of a no-deal Brexit remains high.  We hope, before the end of the Transition Period in Dec., that the UK 
and Europe will agree a trade deal to cover air travel which will allow the free movement of people and the 
deregulated airline market between the UK and Europe to continue.  As an EU airline group, Ryanair should be less 
affected by a no-deal Brexit than our UK registered competitors. However, we still expect Brexit to cause adverse 
trading consequences. Ryanair has put the necessary measures in place to ensure that the Group remains majority 
EU owned, including restricting voting rights of non-EU shareholders, in the event of a "hard-Brexit". We therefore 
expect the Group's AOCs in Austria, Ireland, Malta and Poland to continue to operate freely.  In addition, Ryanair's 
UK AOC (Ryanair UK) will be able to benefit from any bilateral agreements negotiated between the UK and non-EU 
countries while facilitating the operation of domestic UK flights.
   OUTLOOK:
   FY21 will continue to be a hugely challenging year for Ryanair.  Given the current Covid-19 uncertainty, Ryanair 
cannot provide FY21 PAT guidance at this time.  The Group expects to carry approx. 38m passengers in FY21, 
although this guidance could be further revised downwards if EU Govts continue to mismanage air travel and 
impose more uncoordinated travel restrictions or lock downs this winter.  The Group expects to record higher losses 
in H2 than in H1.
   As we look beyond the Covid-19 crisis, and the emergence of effective vaccines in early 2021, the Ryanair Group 
expects to have a lower cost base, a stronger balance sheet, which will enable it to fund lower fares, and add new 
lower cost aircraft to capitalise on the many growth opportunities that will be available in all markets across Europe, 
especially where competitor airlines have substantially cut capacity or failed.

   Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important 
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  It is not reasonably

of an airline operating in the European economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could 
significantly impact Ryanair's expected results are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, 
competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the replacement of aircraft, costs 
associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., European Union 
("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, uncertainties surrounding Brexit, 
weather related disruptions, ATC strikes and staffing related disruptions, delays in the delivery of 
contracted aircraft, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and 
charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic 
environment in Ireland, the UK and Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and 
other economics, social and political factors, global pandemics such as Covid-19 and unforeseen security 
events.

   Going concern
   The directors, having made inquiries, including consideration of the possible future financial effects 
associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, believe that the Group has adequate resources (including the 
EUR1.25BN funds raised through a EUR400M share placing and an EUR850M unsecured Eurobond in September 
2020) to continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months and that it is appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. While there is uncertainty as to the 
full extent of the impact on the Ryanair Holdings plc Group, the continued preparation of the Group's 
consolidated financial statements on the going concern basis is supported by the financial projections 
prepared by the Group.
   Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
   Interim Financial Statements
    1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
   Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the half-year ended September 30, 2020 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -6-
   These 
unaudited 
condensed 
consolidated 
interim 
financial 
statements 
("the 
interim 
financial 
statements"), which should be read in conjunction with our 2020 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 
2020, have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial 
Reporting" as adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full 
annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2020, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/ .
   The September 30, 2020 figures and the September 30, 2019 comparative figures do not constitute 
statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The 
consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2020, together with the 
independent auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the 
Company's Annual General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on 
those financial statements was unqualified.
   The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements for the half-year ended September 30, 2020 on October 30, 2020.
   Except as stated otherwise below, this year's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
   Government grants
   Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the income statement on a 
systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised .
   New IFRS standards and amendments adopted during the year
   The following new and amended IFRS standards, amendments and IFRIC interpretations, have been issued by 
the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the 
Group's financial year beginning on April 1, 2020 and therefore have been applied by the Group in these 
condensed consolidated interim financial statements:
   --    Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendments to IFRS 3 - Definition of a Business (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of Material (effective for fiscal periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendment to IFRS 16 - Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions (effective for fiscal periods beginning 
on or after January 1, 2020)
   The Group has evaluated the extent to which its cashflow hedging relationships are subject to 
uncertainty driven by IBOR reform as at 31 December 2020. The Group's hedged items and hedging instruments 
continue to be indexed to Euribor. These benchmark rates are quoted each day and the IBOR cash flows are 
exchanged with counterparties as usual.
   The calculation methodology of Euribor changed during 2019. In July 2019, the Belgian Financial 
Services and Markets Authority granted authorisation with respect to Euribor under the European Union 
Benchmarks regulation. This allows market participants to continue to use Euribor for both existing and 
new contracts and the Group expects that Euribor will continue to exist as a benchmark for the foreseeable 
future.
   The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on the Group's financial 
position or results from operations in the half-year ended September 30, 2020.
   New IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
   The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for the purposes 
of the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable.  While under review, we do not 
anticipate that the adoption of the other new or revised standards and interpretations will have a 
material impact on our financial position or results from operations:
   --    IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2023)
   --    Amendments to IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023)
   --    Amendments to IFRS 3 - Reference to the Conceptual Framework (effective for fiscal periods 
beginning on or after January 1 2022)
   --    Amendments to IAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before Intended Use (effective 
for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022)
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -6-
   --    Amendments to IAS 37 - Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022)
   --    Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2022)
    --    Amendments to IFRS 17 (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023)
   --    Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform 
(effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021)
   Statement of Cash Flows restatement
   Operating cash inflows and investing cash outflows for the six month period ended 30 September 2019 
have been reclassified. They both have been reduced by EUR274M to reflect accrued supplier payables which 
had previously been presented as capital expenditure in the consolidated cash flows.
    2.            Judgements and estimates
   In preparing these condensed interim financial statements, management has made judgements and estimates 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
   In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the most recent published 
consolidated financial statements.
   Derivative financial instruments
   The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, 
including the risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates. Ryanair uses 
forward contracts for the purchase of its jet fuel (jet kerosene) requirements to reduce its exposure to 
commodity price risk. It also uses foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to risks 
related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the purchase of new 
Boeing 737 aircraft and the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the purchase of jet fuel.

Body
   The Group recognises all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in its consolidated 
balance sheet and measures them at fair value. At September 30, 2020, a net liability of EUR601.5M (2019 
net asset EUR73.5M) was recognised on balance sheet in respect of the Group's jet fuel derivative 
instruments and a net asset of EUR226.6M (2019 net asset EUR508.8M) was recognised in respect of its 
foreign currency derivative instruments associated with future aircraft purchases.
   In determining the hedge effectiveness of derivative instruments used to hedge Ryanair's fuel 
requirements, there is significant judgement involved in assessing whether the volumes of jet fuel hedged 
are still expected to be highly probable forecast transactions. Specifically, significant judgement is 
required in respect of the assumptions related to the timing of the full removal of flight restrictions 
imposed by governments relating to the Covid-19 pandemic, the expected recovery of passenger demand and 
the subsequent flight schedules. All of these assumptions impact upon forecast fuel consumption, and minor 
changes to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
   At March 31, 2020 the Group expected to operate much of its normal Winter 2020/2021 schedule. The Group 
now believes it will operate approximately 40% of its Winter 2020/2021 schedule.
   In respect of foreign currency hedge effectiveness for future aircraft purchases, there is a high 
degree of judgement involved in assessing whether the future aircraft payments are still considered highly 
probable of occurring, and the timing of these future payments for aircraft. The timing of future payments 
for aircraft is dependent on the aircraft manufacturer's ability to meet forecast aircraft delivery 
schedules.
   The Boeing 737-MAX was grounded in 2019, Boeing are currently working with the FAA and EASA regarding a 
return to service. At March 31, 2020 the aircraft was expected to return to service in the United States 
in the third quarter of 2020, the current expectation is that the aircraft will return to service in the 
United States in the fourth quarter of 2020 with a return to service in Europe a number of months 
thereafter.
    3.            Seasonality of operations
   The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly, 
the first half-year has traditionally resulted in higher revenues and results.
    4.            Income tax expense
   The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the half-year ended September 
30, 2020 was 5.0% (September 30, 2019: 8.5%).  The tax credit for the half-year ended September 30, 2020 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -7-
of EUR21.8M (tax charge September 30, 2019: EUR106.8M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR9.5M and, a 
deferred tax credit of EUR31.3M primarily relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and 
equipment and net operating losses.
    5.            Share based payments
   The terms and conditions of the Group's share based remuneration programmes are disclosed in the most 
recent, published, consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR2.1M in the half-year ended 
September 30, 2020 (September 30, 2019: EUR4.0M) is the fair value of options granted in prior periods, 
which is being recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee services rendered.
    6.            Contingencies
   The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management 
believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to materially 
adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
    7.            Capital commitments
   At September 30, 2020 the Group had an operating fleet of 438 (2019: 455) Boeing 737 and 28 (2019: 21) 
Airbus A320 aircraft. The Group has agreed to purchase up to 210 (135 firm and 75 options) Boeing 737-MAX-
200 aircraft from the Boeing Corporation which will deliver (subject to EASA & FAA regulatory approval) 
over the next five or more years.
    8.            Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis
   The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the Group CEO, who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).
   The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the profit/(loss) after tax of each airline 
for the reporting period. Resource allocation decisions for all airlines are based on airline performance 
for the relevant period, with the objective in making these resource allocation decisions being to 
optimize consolidated financial results.
   Ryanair DAC ("Ryanair") is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Buzz, Lauda and Malta 
Air do not exceed the quantitative thresholds for reporting purposes and accordingly have been presented 
on an aggregate basis in the table below.
   There are varying levels of integration between the operating segments. Inter-segment revenue is not 
material and thus not subject to separate disclosure.
   Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

  *The fair value of each of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values due to the 
short-term nature of the instruments
    13.           Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
   In April 2020, the Group raised approximately GBP600M unsecured debt for general corporate purposes 
under the HMT and Bank of England CCFF.
   The Group issued senior, unsecured bonds with a face value of EUR850M on September 15, 2020. The bond 
has a coupon rate of 2.875% and a maturity date of September 15, 2025
    14.          Shareholders equity and shareholder returns
   In September 2020, 35.2M ordinary shares were issued via an ordinary share placing at a price of 
EUR11.35 per share generating EUR400M proceeds.
   During the period 0.9M ordinary shares were issued at a strike price between EUR6.25 and EUR6.74 per 
share following the exercise of vested options.
   There were no shareholder returns during the half-year ended September 30, 2020.
   In FY20 the Company bought back 47.2M shares at a total cost of EUR581M. This buyback was equivalent to 
approximately 4.2% of the Company's issued share capital at March 31, 2020.  All of these repurchased 
ordinary shares were cancelled at March 31, 2020.
   As a result of the share buybacks in the year ended March 31, 2020, share capital decreased by 47.2M 
ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR581M and the other undenominated capital reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.3M. The other undenominated capital reserve is required to be created under Irish law 
to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
    15.          Related party transactions
   The Company's related parties comprise its subsidiaries, Directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
   There were no related party transactions in the quarter ended September 30, 2020 that materially 
affected the financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -9-
changes in the related party transactions described in the 2020 Annual Report that could have a material 
effect on the financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
    16.          Government grants and assistance
   During the six months to September 30, 2020, many European countries in which the Ryanair Group 
operates made available payroll support schemes. The Ryanair Group utilised a number of these employment 
retention schemes to protect jobs within the Group. These schemes were a mix of short term Covid-19 
specific programmes and long term schemes linked to social security that existed pre Covid-19. The total 
amount of payroll supports received by the Group under the various schemes amounted to approximately 
EUR44M and are offset against staff costs in the Consolidated Income Statement.
   In April 2020, the Group raised GBP600M unsecured (12 months) debt for general corporate purposes under 
the HMT and Bank of England CCFF. The 0.44% interest rate was the prevailing rate for strong BBB rated 
companies.
    17.          Post balance sheet events
   On 15 October the Group reduced its Winter schedule (November to March 2021) taking capacity down from 
60% to 40% of prior year.
    18.          Going concern
   Due to its ongoing cost reductions, recent EUR1.25BN fundraising which underpinned the Group's strong 
BBB rated balance sheet, and cost preservation measures, the Board are satisfied that it remains 
appropriate to adopt the going concern concept.

Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 ("Transparency Directive"), and the Transparency 
Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland.

Body
   For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") (with the exception of the balance sheet 
commentary below) all figures and comments are by reference to the adjusted results excluding the exceptional 
item referred to below.
   Ongoing EU Government travel & flight restrictions as a result of Covid-19 means that the Group will operate a 
significantly reduced flying schedule in H2 FY21 compared to what was originally expected. Therefore, the Group is 
recording an exceptional hedge ineffectiveness charge of EUR167M (net of a tax credit) in relation to H2 FY21 jet 
fuel hedges and a EUR47M charge (net of a tax credit) in relation to ineffective currency cashflow hedges primarily 
from delayed capex.
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues decreased by 79% to EUR790.8M due to an 80% decline in traffic to 17M as EU 
Governments imposed flight and/or travel bans due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This grounded approx. 99% of the 
Group's fleet for almost 4 months (from mid-March to late June). The Group operated approximately 50% of its 
normal Q2 schedule with a 72% load factor.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues decreased by 77% to EUR385.4M due to an 80% decline in traffic (as highlighted above) to 
17M offset by a strong performance in priority boarding and reserved seating.
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues decreased by 78% to EUR1,176.2M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil decreased by 78% to EUR343.0M due to a 73% reduction in sectors flown, arising from Covid-19 
fleet groundings and improved fuel burn.
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation was 22% lower at EUR296.5M, primarily due to lower amortisation as a result of reduced aircraft 
utilisation.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -5-
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs decreased by 60% to EUR234.7M due to reduced flight hours, a recruitment freeze, Group wide pay 
cuts and participation in EU Government payroll support schemes.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges decreased by 74% to EUR169.7M due to lower sectors and reduced charges.
   Route charges:
   Route charges decreased by 73% to EUR115.3M primarily due to significantly reduced sectors arising from 
Covid-19 fleet groundings
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other decreased by 64% to EUR106.4M due to lower discretionary spending across 
the Group airlines and fewer flights qualifying for EU261 compensation due to improved on-time performance in H1 
(97% OTP).
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs decreased by 40% to EUR82.6M due to reduced aircraft utilisation.
   Aircraft rentals:
   Aircraft rentals fell by 83% to EUR4.8M due to 14 fewer leased B737 aircraft in the fleet.
   Other expense:
   Finance expenses decreased by EUR11.3M to EUR15.3M as a result of higher USD denominated cash on 
deposit and the maturity of more expensive secured debt.
   Balance sheet:
   Gross cash increased by EUR694.3M to EUR4,502.3.0M at September 30, 2020.
   Gross debt rose by EUR1,374.0M to EUR5,585.2M primarily due to a EUR850M Eurobond issuance in 
September 2020 and GBP600M unsecured debt under the HMT and Bank of England CCFF, offset by EUR132.3M 
debt repayments and EUR38.2M lease liability payments.
   Net debt was EUR1,082.9M at period end.
   Shareholders' equity:
   Shareholders' equity increased by EUR64.2M to EUR4,978.7M in the period primarily due to a EUR400.0M of 
equity placing in September 2020 offset by a net loss of EUR410.5M and IFRS hedge accounting unrealised gain 
for derivatives of EUR69.1M.
   MD&A Quarter Ended September 30, 2020

commentary below) all figures and comments are by reference to the adjusted results excluding the exceptional 
item referred to below.
   Ongoing EU Government travel & flight restrictions as a result of Covid-19 means that the Group will operate a 
significantly reduced flying schedule in H2 FY21 compared to what was originally expected. Therefore, the Group is 
recording an exceptional hedge ineffectiveness charge of EUR153M (net of a tax credit) in relation to H2 FY21 jet 
fuel hedges and a EUR50M charge (net of a tax credit) in relation to ineffective currency cashflow hedges primarily 
from delayed capex.
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:

Governments imposed flight and/or travel bans due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Group operated approximately 
50% of its normal Q2 schedule with a 72% load factor.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues decreased by 58% to EUR360.9M due to a 62% decline in traffic (as highlighted above) to just 
16.7M offset by a strong performance in priority boarding and reserved seating.

   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil decreased by 58% to EUR334.1M due to a 49% reduction in sectors flown, arising from Covid-19 
fleet groundings and improved fuel burn.

   Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   Interim Management Report
   Introduction
   This financial report for the half-year ended September 30, 2020 meets the reporting requirements pursuant to the 
Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland.
   This interim management report includes the following:
   -- Principal risks and uncertainties relating to the remaining six months of the year;
   -- Related party transactions; and
   -- Post balance sheet events.
   Results of operations for the six-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to the six month period 
ended September 30, 2019, including important events that occurred during the half-year, are set forth above in the 
MD&A.
   Principal risks and uncertainties for the remainder of the year
   The Covid-19 pandemic and measures to reduce its spread have had, and will likely continue to have, a material 
adverse impact on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Since February 
2020, governments globally have implemented a range of travel restrictions including lockdowns, "do not travel" 
advisories, restrictions on travel from certain international locations, enhanced airport screenings, mandatory 
quarantine requirements, and other similar measures. Other governmental restrictions and regulations in the future 
in response to Covid-19 could include additional travel restrictions, quarantines of additional populations (including 
the Group's personnel), restrictions on our ability to access our facilities or aircraft or requirements to collect 
additional passenger data. In addition, governments, non-governmental organizations and entities in the private 
sector have issued and may continue to issue non-binding advisories or recommendations regarding air travel or 
other social distancing measures, including limitations on the number of persons that should be present at public 
gatherings. In addition, Ryanair has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant Covid-19 related costs for 
enhanced aircraft cleaning and additional procedures to limit transmission among its personnel and customers. 
Although these procedures are currently elective, the industry may in the future be subject to further cleaning and 
safety measures, which may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement. These measures, 
individually and combined, could have a material adverse impact on the Group's business.
   The full extent of the ongoing impact of Covid-19 on the Group's longer-term operational and financial 
performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of the Group's control, including the 
duration and spread of Covid-19 and related travel advisories and restrictions, the impact of Covid-19 on overall 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -5-
long-term demand for air travel, the impact of Covid-19 on the financial health and operations of the Group's 
business partners (particularly Boeing), and future governmental actions, all of which are highly uncertain and 
cannot be predicted.

   We conducted our review having regard to the Financial Reporting Council's International Standard on 
Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity.  A review of interim financial information consists of making 
enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical 
and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance 
that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion.
   We read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of consolidated interim financial statements and 
to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the review. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies, we consider the implications for our report.
   The purpose of our review work and to whom we owe our responsibilities
   This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the 
Company in meeting the requirements of the Transparency Directive and the Transparency Rules of the 
Central Bank of Ireland. Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those 
matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company for our 
review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached.

   Diluted earnings per share takes account solely of the potential future exercises of share options 
granted under the Company's share option schemes and the weighted average number of shares includes 
weighted average share options assumed to be converted of 4.1M (2019: 2.8M) and weighted issued share 
capital of 4.8M (2019: Nil).
    10.          Property, plant and equipment
   Acquisitions and disposals
   Capital expenditure in the half-year ended September 30, 2020 amounted to a credit of EUR143M this 
includes EUR250M supplier proceeds and capital expenditure of EUR108M that primarily relates to heavy 
maintenance checks.
    11.          Assets held for sale
   In August 2019, the Group entered into an agreement to sell 10 Boeing 737 aircraft in the years ending 
March 31, 2020 and 2021. 3 of these aircraft were sold during the year ended March 31, 2020. A further 2 
aircraft were sold during the half-year ended September 30, 2020. The remaining 5 aircraft are presented 
as assets held for sale as at September 30, 2020 and are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and 
fair value less costs to sell.
    12.           Derivative financial instruments
   As a result of the widespread grounding of aircraft due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group expects to 
operate a significantly reduced flying schedule for the year ending March 31, 2021 compared to what was 
originally expected. Accordingly, as at September 30, 2020, the Group's exposures for jet fuel and foreign 
currency were significantly reduced, causing a proportion of derivative financial instruments which 
previously qualified for hedge accounting to become ineffective, resulting in the discontinuance of 
certain cash-flow hedge arrangements. A net expense of EUR214M was recognised within the income statement 
for the half-year ended September 30, 2020, comprising a charge of EUR167M (net of tax) in respect of jet 
fuel exposures and a charge of EUR47M (net of tax), primarily associated with ineffective currency cash-
flow hedges for fiscal year 2021 jet fuel and delayed capital expenditure. As of September 30, 2020, a 
balance of EUR153M (loss) is recognised in the cash flow reserve in respect of continuing hedges and 
EUR111M (gain) in respect of hedging relationships for which hedge accounting is no longer applied
    13.           Financial instruments and financial risk management
   The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -8-
   These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2020 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
   Fair value hierarchy
   Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
   --    Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
the Group can access at the measurement date.
   --    Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    --    Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
   Fair value estimation
   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
   Financial instruments measured at fair value
   --    Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
   --          Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and EUA contracts: A comparison of 
the contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at September 30, 
2020 has been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
   The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, 
there were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
   Financial instruments not measured at fair value
   --          Long-term debt: The repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at September 30, 2020 to 
arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
   There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the quarter ended 
September 30, 2020 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
    13.           Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
   The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated balance sheet, are as follows:
                                             At Sep 30,   At Sep 30,   At Mar 31,   At Mar 31,

   RYANAIR TO CUT WINTER CAPACITY FROM 60% TO 40% OF PRIOR YEAR
   CORK, SHANNON, TOULOUSE BASES TO CLOSE FOR WINTER AS FY TRAFFIC GUIDANCE REDUCED TO 38M
   Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, today (Thurs 15(th) Oct) released its revised winter schedule. Due 
to increased flight restrictions imposed by EU Govts, air travel to/from much of Central Europe, the UK, 
Ireland, Austria, Belgium and Portugal have been heavily curtailed. This has caused forward bookings to 
weaken slightly in Oct, but materially in Nov & Dec.
   In light of these weaker bookings, and Ryanair's plan to operate with a 70% load factors, Ryanair has 
today further reduced its winter schedule (Nov - Mar) taking capacity down from 60% to 40% of prior year. 
Ryanair expects to maintain up to 65% of its winter route network, but with reduced frequencies. In 
addition to the winter closure of bases in Cork, Shannon, and Toulouse, Ryanair has announced significant 
base aircraft cuts in Belgium, Germany, Spain, Portugal and Vienna.
   With this greatly reduced winter capacity and load factors of approx. 70%, Ryanair now expects full 
year (FY21) traffic to fall to approx. 38m guests, although this guidance could be further revised 
downwards if EU Govts continue to mismanage air travel and impose more lockdowns this winter.
   Ryanair's Group CEO Michael O'Leary said:
   "We have continued to flex our capacity in Sept & Oct to reflect both market conditions and changing 
Government restrictions, with the objective of sustaining a 70% load factor, which allows us operate as 
close to breakeven as possible and minimise cash burn. While the Covid situation remains fluid and hard to 
predict, we must now cut our full year traffic forecast to 38m guests.
   While we deeply regret these winter schedule cuts they have been forced upon us by Government 
mismanagement of EU air travel. Our focus continues to be on maintaining as large a schedule as we can 
sensibly operate to keep our aircraft, our pilots and our cabin crew current and employed while minimising 
job losses. It is inevitable, given the scale of these cutbacks, that we will be implementing  more unpaid 
leave, and job sharing this winter in those bases where we have agreed reduced working time and pay, but

demonstrate that their Covid case rates are less than 50 per 100,000 population."

   Ideagen PLC (AIM: IDEA), a leading supplier of Information Management Software to highly regulated industries, 
announces that it has allotted a total of 33,330 new ordinary shares of 1 penny each in the capital of the Company 
("Ordinary Shares") following the purchase of 3,817 Ordinary Shares by a number of employees under the

entitlements of a number of overseas employees under the terms of the SIP.
   Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the 33,330 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to 
trading on AIM ("Admission") and it is expected that Admission will become effective and trading will commence at 
8.00 a.m. on 5 October 2020.
   After Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue will be 226,659,284 and the total number of voting 
rights will therefore be 226,659,284. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the

   Civil Aviation Authority Transport Act 2000 investigation - draft decision
   The UK Civil Aviation Authority has today published its draft decision in relation to an investigation 
(Project Palamon) under section 34 of the Transport Act 2000 (TA00). We have considered alleged 
contraventions by NATS (En-Route) Plc ("NERL") of certain statutory duties under the TA00 and certain 
conditions of its Air Traffic Services Licence. This investigation followed complaints by Ryanair and 
Stansted Airport about air traffic flow management delays experienced by airlines and passengers of 
Stansted and Luton airports.
   This investigation also follows an earlier investigation conducted by the Civil Aviation Authority 
addressing similar complaints brought by Ryanair and Stansted Airport in 2016 in relation to NERL's 
performance (Project Oberon).
   In our draft decision we provisionally find that:
   -     In relation to the provision of sufficient staffing resilience in the London Approach Service to 
users of Stansted and Luton, NERL has contravened its duties in the period January 2019 to March 2020;
   -     In relation to other parts of the investigation, including on airspace capacity, coding and 
discrimination, NERL has not contravened its duties and obligations.
   This is a draft decision and we welcome the views of all stakeholders on our provisional findings by 19 
October 2020 (to economicregulation@caa.co.uk ).   We will consider all the representations we receive 
carefully and intend to issue a final decision later this year.
   In making these provisional findings, we have taken account of the very difficult circumstances faced 
by the aviation sector and that air traffic volumes have reduced significantly, following the impact of 
the Covid-19 pandemic.  We also note that forecasts for recovery are highly uncertain and it appears 
likely it will take some time to reach traffic levels seen in 2018 and 2019. These circumstances suggest 
that it will not be appropriate to take formal enforcement action, as the circumstances leading to the 
investigation are not currently occurring. Nonetheless, we make a number of recommendations that we expect 
NERL (and other stakeholders) to take into account in the future as they plan how to provide a resilient 
service when demand begins to recover, and in the longer term.

   Our draft decision can be found at: www.caa.co.uk/cap1943 and on the Monitoring and Enforcement section 
of the CAA's NERL Licence webpage, available at www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-industry/Airspace/Air-traffic-
control/Air-navigation-services/NATS-En-Route-plc-NERL-Licence/

   Ryanair Holdings plc
   (the "Company")
   IMPORTANT COVID-19 NOTICE
   Arrangements for the 2020 Annual General Meeting ("AGM")
   to be held at 9.00am on Thursday, September 17, 2020
   Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") today announces that in accordance with the guidelines of the 
Government of Ireland updated on September 7, 2020 in respect of Meetings and Events ("Guidelines For Re-
Opening Hotels and Guesthouses"), the Company's AGM will be held as planned in the CityNorth Hotel and 
Conference Centre, Gormanston, Co. Meath, K32 W562, Ireland at 9.00 a.m. on September 17, 2020
   The well-being of the Company's shareholders and employees is a primary concern for the Directors. The 
Company will take all Government recommendations into account in the conduct of the AGM. Attendance will 
consequently be limited to 50 people, including directors and service staff.
   Shareholder participation and engagement have been and will continue to be ensured. The Board is 
therefore strongly encouraging all shareholders to:
   --          submit a proxy form not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the AGM or any 
adjournment thereof in order to ensure they can exercise their vote and be represented at the AGM without 
attending in person; and
   --          appoint the Chairman of the meeting as their proxy rather than a named person who will not 
be permitted to attend the meeting in person.
   Proxy forms can be submitted in advance of the AGM by availing of one of the options set out in the 
notice of the AGM:
   --          By post to the Company's Registrar, Link Registrars Limited, PO Box 1110, Maynooth, Co. 
Kildare, Ireland or by hand to Link Registrars Limited, Level 2, Block C, Maynooth Business Campus, 
Maynooth, Co. Kildare, W23 F854, Ireland.
    --          By fax to +353 (1) 2240700, provided it is received in legible form.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of AGM
    --          Electronically by accessing www.signalshares.com.
    --          Via the CREST System, where shares are held in CREST.
   Since the AGM will be held under extremely constrained circumstances in order to comply with the 
Government restrictions, it will not be possible for members of the press to attend.
   The Company is aware that the Government of Ireland is planning to announce a set of measures related 
to Covid-19 on September 15, 2020, which may include further restrictions on the holding of professional 
(non-social) meetings.  If such restrictions are announced prior to the Company's AGM, the Company will 
issue a further update to shareholders, which may include a notification that the AGM will be held as a 
closed meeting.
   In anticipation that a closed AGM may be required, the Company is offering shareholders an opportunity 
to submit questions relating to the business of the meeting in advance, to be received by no later than 
17:00 on Tuesday, September 15, 2020. Questions can be submitted by email to AGM2020@ryanair.com , with 
the shareholder's name and address for verification purposes. Responses to the questions will be posted on 
the Company's website on the day of the AGM.
   As the situation is evolving and the Irish Government's guidance may change, shareholders are 
encouraged to check the website of the Company for any further updates regarding the AGM at 
https://investor.ryanair.com/ .

   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].
Ryanair Holdings PLC Holding(s) in Company -2-
   (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be 
presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.
