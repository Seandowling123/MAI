million passengers, compared to 7.51 million passengers for May 2012.
Body
Load factor for the month of May 2013 was 82%, an increase of one percentage point, compared to 81% for May 
2012. Robin Kiely, head of communications at Ryanair, said: "Ryanair's traffic increased by 5% over May 2012 and 
our load factor rose by 1%, as we enjoyed a record 12-month period with almost 80m passengers choosing one of 
our ultra-low fares since May 2012, a rise of 4%. Only Ryanair sells Europe's lowest fares with no fuel surcharges

arch-rival Boeing at its domestic Paris Airshow
Body
European planemaker Airbus sought to finalise a flurry of orders today to avoid a rare defeat to U.S. arch-rival 
Boeing at its domestic Paris Airshow.
As of Wednesday, Airbus lagged its competitor with 211 firm orders against 265 for Boeing. Airbus had 
commitments for a further 165 jets, compared with 127 for Boeing.
The order tallies from both planemakers included major purchases of narrowbody medium-haul jets from Europe's 
two biggest low-cost carriers, Ryanair and easyJet.
Ryanair formally approved its deal in a ceremonial signing at the air show on Wednesday, while easyJet reached a 
provisional agreement to buy more than 135 A320-family jets set to be firmed up at a later date. Both planemakers 
have announced a volley of wide-body jet orders during a week that saw Boeing launch a new version of its 787 
Dreamliner and Airbus finalise deals with Singapore Airlines and Air France-KLM. One of the new 787-10 launch 
customers, United Airlines , is close to placing an order for around 35 A350s including some upgrades of smaller 
models, industry sources said. Industry sources also told Reuters earlier this month that Airbus was poised to win a 
hotly contested order from Boeing operator VivaAerobus. The Mexican low-cost carrier could place orders for as 
many as 50 jets. Airbus is also close to concluding a deal with state-owned Kuwait Airways. ( C ) Reuters

(RTTNews) - Ireland-based low cost carrier Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) would brief analysts and major 
shareholders on its revised plans in two significant matters at an investor conference in London today.
As a result of increased demand and lower costs from both existing and new airport partners across Europe, 
Ryanair said it plans to step up its growth rate from 5% to 7% per annum over the coming years and would 
accordingly target to carry 110 million passengers by fiscal year March 2019 instead of the prior 100 million target.
Further, Ryanair detailed plans to return up to 1 billion euros to stockholders over the next couple of years with at 
least 400 million euros in share buybacks to be completed in the current year to fiscal year March 2014 and up to a 
further 600 million euros in either special dividends or repurchases targeted in fiscal year March 2015, subject to 
current fuel, yields and profitability trends continuing.

PLANE orders at the Paris Air Show topped $100bn (£64.6bn) at list prices yesterday as Ryanair and Air France-
KLM both confirmed multibillion pound deals.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said he is weighing up another big purchase with Boeing yesterday, as the ink dried 
on his order for 175 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, worth $15.6bn at list prices.
Airlines typically get substantial discounts for large plane deals.
Air France KLM also revealed its order for 25 Airbus A350 aircraft, worth $7.2bn at list, while signing a preliminary 
deal with Rolls Royce for 50 engines for the planes.

Air France-KLM orders 25 wide-body Airbus A350s

Body
Air France-KLM ordered 25 Airbus A350 jets on Wednesday, saying the wide-body plane that flew for the first time 
last week will be central to its plan to expand long-haul flights after years of struggling against discount carriers in 
Europe.
Airbus also announced that SriLankan Airlines, the country's national carrier, would buy four A350s and six slightly 
smaller A330 jets. That deal is worth around $2.8 billion at list prices.
The Air France deal is worth around $7.2 billion at list prices but customers can negotiate steep discounts. It's a 
major investment for the airline, which has posted operating losses over the past couple of years.
The purchase fits in with Air France-KLMs hope to shift away from the cutthroat short-haul market. "This year is a 
pivotal year for their recovery plan," said Robin Byde, an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald Europe.
Wednesday's announcements at the Paris Air Show represent a vote of confidence in the A350, which Airbus is 
hoping will help it catch up to Boeing's popular 787 and 777 in the lucrative field of long-haul wide-body jets. The 
A350, which typically seats 314 passengers, has a list price of $287.7 million; the A330, which doesn't fly as far as 
the A350, has a list price of $239.4 million.
The A350 makes extensive use of lightweight carbon fiber, at a time when fuel costs are a major concern. Potential 
customers at the air show haven't been able to see the plane at Le Bourget the plane is not yet cleared for flight 
there. First deliveries of the plane are expected in mid-2014.
Discount carriers, who have successfully competed in both the United States and Europe against more established 
airlines, also made their mark at the air show.
Boeing Co. on Wednesday finalized an order for 175 of its popular short-haul 737s with Irish low-cost airline 
Ryanair. The purchase would be valued at $15.6 billion at list prices, but Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has said 
he's getting a steep discount although less than the 53 percent markdown on a prior order.
Boeing also announced orders for a total of 33 of its new generation 737-MAX 8 jets, extending the popularity of the 
fuel-efficient aircraft. The 737-MAX 8 planes have a list price of $100.5 million.
Air France-KLM orders 25 wide-body Airbus A350s
Aircraft leasing company CIT Aerospace, which placed an order for 30 on Wednesday, is responsible for a fleet of 
350 aircraft, including 128 Boeing jets, according to the company. Travel Service, an airline based in Eastern 
Europe, ordered three.
Smaller jet purchases have made up the bulk of the orders this year as airlines renew their fleets or expand into 
new markets, notably in Asia and Latin America.
The 737 carries between 150 and 200 passengers and is Boeing's most popular model. First deliveries of the MAX 
are expected in 2017.

Airbus raked in orders Wednesday for its new A350, announcing 59 sales of the wide-body jet that flew for the first 
time last week.
Singapore Airlines ordered 30 A350-900s, with an option to buy another 20 of the 900s or the larger 1000 model. 
The airline had already ordered 20 of the A350.
Air France-KLM also put in an order for 25 A350 jets, saying the plane will be central to its plan to expand long-haul

enough twin-aisle aircraft and gains access to cities in both Europe and the United States, its chief executive said 
today.

Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, could start selling low-cost trans-Atlantic flights if it secures enough twin-
aisle aircraft and gains access to cities in both Europe and the United States, its chief executive said today.
"This will be a unique opportunity to bust open the trans-Atlantic services. Trans-Atlantic fares should start at dollar 
10 or 10 euros," said Michael O'Leary at the Paris Airshow.
Any move into the competitive trans-Atlantic market would see the Irish short-haul carrier follow in the footsteps of 
Laker Airways, which began low-fare flights from London to New York in the late 1970s but went bankrupt in 1982.
Long-haul budget flights have become popular in Asia in recent years with Malaysia's AirAsia X , Australia's Jetstar 
and its Singapore-based affiliate Jetstar Asia, and Singapore Airlines subsidiary Scoot starting operations. O'Leary 
said a long-haul business would have to be run separately to succeed, allowing management and staff of the short-
haul business to remain focused on that. A long-haul service would also need to start operations with a fairly large 
fleet of 30-50 aircraft in order to have economies of scale, he added. "There is an opportunity with the EU-U.S. 
open skies to, on a fairly big scale, connect 15-20 European cities with 15 of the big U.S. cities almost from day 
one. But you need a fleet of 30, 40, 50 aircraft and not two, four or six," said O'Leary. The business model would 
also be different from Ryanair's short-haul one, which hinges on offering low fares on flights that are operated in a 
high-density single-class configuration in Boeing 737 aircraft. Passengers have to pay for frills such as better seats 
and checked-in baggage. A long-haul service, for example, could feature a "premium" section, just like that offered 
by the Asian airlines. "There is 15 percent of the public who will pay for the frills and you will be mad to switch off 
from that," said O'Leary. It has, however, been tough to make money with long-haul budget flights. Laker Airways 
went bust in a recession in the early 1980s, and as its full-service competitors on the trans-Atlantic services cut 
fares in order to get more passengers on-board as demand fell. There have also been questions about the

profitability of the Asian airlines. Malaysia's AirAsia X dropped services from Kuala Lumpur to London and Paris 
due to the cost of fuel and the relative inefficiency of the Airbus A340 aircraft, and due to competition from full-
service airlines such as Emirates. It also dropped services to India due to the country's high taxes, showing how 
factors outside an airline's control can affect its cost base and make a dent on thin profit margins. However AirAsia 
X, which has 10 Airbus A330-300 aircraft, is more successful with its intra-Asia Pacific flights and is adding more 
services to destinations within the region. It plans to list on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange this year, and to use 
part of the proceeds to help pay for aircraft it has on order, which include 15 more A330s and 10 A350s.

Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, could start selling low-cost trans-Atlantic flights if it secures enough twin-
aisle aircraft and gains access to cities in both Europe and the United States, its chief executive said today.
"This will be a unique opportunity to bust open the trans-Atlantic services. Trans-Atlantic fares should start at dollar 
10 or 10 euros," said Michael O'Leary at the Paris Airshow.
Any move into the competitive trans-Atlantic market would see the Irish short-haul carrier follow in the footsteps of 
Laker Airways, which began low-fare flights from London to New York in the late 1970s but went bankrupt in 1982.
Long-haul budget flights have become popular in Asia in recent years with Malaysia's AirAsia X , Australia's Jetstar 
and its Singapore-based affiliate Jetstar Asia, and Singapore Airlines subsidiary Scoot starting operations. O'Leary 
said a long-haul business would have to be run separately to succeed, allowing management and staff of the short-
haul business to remain focused on that. A long-haul service would also need to start operations with a fairly large 
fleet of 30-50 aircraft in order to have economies of scale, he added. "There is an opportunity with the EU-U.S. 
open skies to, on a fairly big scale, connect 15-20 European cities with 15 of the big U.S. cities almost from day 
one. But you need a fleet of 30, 40, 50 aircraft and not two, four or six," said O'Leary. The business model would 
also be different from Ryanair's short-haul one, which hinges on offering low fares on flights that are operated in a 
high-density single-class configuration in Boeing 737 aircraft. Passengers have to pay for frills such as better seats 
and checked-in baggage. A long-haul service, for example, could feature a "premium" section, just like that offered 
by the Asian airlines. "There is 15 percent of the public who will pay for the frills and you will be mad to switch off 
from that," said O'Leary. It has, however, been tough to make money with long-haul budget flights. Laker Airways 
went bust in a recession in the early 1980s, and as its full-service competitors on the trans-Atlantic services cut 
fares in order to get more passengers on-board as demand fell. There have also been questions about the

profitability of the Asian airlines. Malaysia's AirAsia X dropped services from Kuala Lumpur to London and Paris 
due to the cost of fuel and the relative inefficiency of the Airbus A340 aircraft, and due to competition from full-
service airlines such as Emirates. It also dropped services to India due to the country's high taxes, showing how 
factors outside an airline's control can affect its cost base and make a dent on thin profit margins. However AirAsia 
X, which has 10 Airbus A330-300 aircraft, is more successful with its intra-Asia Pacific flights and is adding more 
services to destinations within the region. It plans to list on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange this year, and to use 
part of the proceeds to help pay for aircraft it has on order, which include 15 more A330s and 10 A350s.

The ISEQ continued its modest climb-back with all eyes on the Federal Reserve's statement and news conference 
tonight.
The index climbed 12.55 points to 3,943.42.
Two days of gains this week suggest investors expect reassurances of continued economic support from the U.S. 
central bank. The equity market had been roiled recently by suggestions that the Fed's asset purchases would be 
scaled back earlier than anticipated.
At home, Ryanair's stocks rose 11c to E6.96 after it today finalised a firm order with Boeing for 175 new 737-800 
aircraft in a deal worth dollar 15.6 billion at current list prices after the deal was cleared with shareholders 
yesterday. This will allow Ryanair to grow its fleet to more than 400 aircraft, serving more than 100m passengers a 
year across Europe by the end of the delivery stream in 2019. The deal, which was originally announced as a 
commitment in March, is Boeing's largest ever firm aircraft order from a European airline and the largest industrial 
order in the history of the Irish State. CRH stocks rose 3c to E15.51. The American Institute of Architects' 
Architecture Billings Index (ABI) posted a return to growth in May, a welcome development after a disappointing 
April brought to an end the index's winning streak of eight consecutive months above the critical 50-level, said 
Justin Doyle of Investec in Dublin. The ABI serves as a lead indicator for non-residential construction activity, with 
readings above 50 indicating an increase in activity. "Although the index has recovered substantially from its low of 
34.7 (January 2009), its current level of 52.9 (+8.8pc mom and +15.5pc yoy) is still well below its 10-year high of 
60.6 (September 2005) highlighting the significant potential for future growth. Notwithstanding the disappointing 
performance in April, momentum has been building in the U.S. non-residential construction sector of late and we

The deal, which was originally announced as a commitment in March, is Boeing's largest ever firm aircraft order

It was concluded by Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, and Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief 
executive, Ray Conner, at a ceremony today at the Paris Air Show. These 175 new Boeing aircraft will create more 
than 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers at Ryanair's growing number of aircraft bases across 
Europe and will allow Ryanair to grow by about 5pc a year over the next five years, taking Ryanair's traffic to over 
100m passengers a year by March 2019. Ryanair's order will also sustain thousands of skilled manufacturing jobs 
in Boeing and its supplier companies and represents the largest ever capital investment by an Irish company in U.S. 
manufacturing and U.S. jobs. The first of these new Boeing aircraft is due for delivery in September 2014 and a 
senior Ryanair working group is continuing to evaluate the benefits of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft, which enters 
service in 2017. "Ryanair is pleased to finalise this firm order with Boeing to purchase 175 new 737-800 jets, which 
will expand our fleet to over 400 units, creating over 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers, while 
allowing us to grow our traffic over the next 5 years to 100 million passengers p.a," said Ryanair CEO, Michael

Ryanair today finalised a firm order with Boeing for 175 new 737-800 aircraft in a deal worth dollar 15.6 billion at 
current list prices after the deal was cleared with shareholders yesterday.
This will allow Ryanair to grow its fleet to more than 400 aircraft, serving more than 100m passengers a year across 
Europe by the end of the delivery stream in 2019.
The deal, which was originally announced as a commitment in March, is Boeing's largest ever firm aircraft order 
from a European airline and the largest industrial order in the history of the Irish State.
It was concluded by Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, and Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief 
executive, Ray Conner, at a ceremony today at the Paris Air Show. These 175 new Boeing aircraft will create more 
than 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers at Ryanair's growing number of aircraft bases across 
Europe and will allow Ryanair to grow by about 5pc a year over the next five years, taking Ryanair's traffic to over 
100m passengers a year by March 2019. Ryanair's order will also sustain thousands of skilled manufacturing jobs 
in Boeing and its supplier companies and represents the largest ever capital investment by an Irish company in U.S. 
manufacturing and U.S. jobs. The first of these new Boeing aircraft is due for delivery in September 2014 and a 
senior Ryanair working group is continuing to evaluate the benefits of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft, which enters 
service in 2017. "Ryanair is pleased to finalise this firm order with Boeing to purchase 175 new 737-800 jets, which 
will expand our fleet to over 400 units, creating over 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers, while 
allowing us to grow our traffic over the next 5 years to 100 million passengers p.a," said Ryanair CEO, Michael 
O'Leary.

Is it harder to succeed as an entrepreneur because big companies control more industries than they did? This was 
the suggestion of a recent article by Ben Casselman in the Wall Street Journal. He made the case that start-ups are 
declining because animal spirits are fading in the US.
I profoundly disagree with his contentions, and there are statistics to back my case. The Global Entrepreneurship 
Monitor , an annual assessment published jointly by Babson College and London Business School, found that total 
activity in the US in 2012 was at its highest level since 1999.
In particular I take issue with the idea that "dominance of large corporations in nearly every industry . . . makes it 
tough for new ventures to gain a foothold". I believe quite the opposite: the tendency towards consolidation creates 
opportunities for innovative newcomers.
Take banking in the UK. For decades it has been a cosy oligopoly. But like sheep, several banks overextended and 
almost went bust during the financial crisis. The traditional high street banks have also alienated customers with 
poor service and scandals such as the mis-selling of payment protection insurance . Despite regulatory and capital 
hurdles, a number of new players are upsetting the cartel - from Aldermore to Metro Bank (where I am a director), 
from Virgin to peer-to-peer lenders. I predict there will be many more, who will relentlessly erode the share of the 
slothful incumbents, most of which have terrible reputations combined with demoralised management, and have 
underinvested in IT and their branches. Only customer inertia has saved them from losing much bigger chunks of 
their business. But over time, it will happen.
Bookmaking is another sector where a trio of operators - William Hill, Ladbrokes and Corals - has commanded the 
market for decades. A fourth group, Paddy Power, came to Britain less than a decade ago, with just three shops by 
2005. But through entertaining punters with its quirky marketing, the Irish gambling business has expanded 100-fold 
in the past eight years.
When partners and I took control of PizzaExpress it had just 12 company-owned restaurants. It was a distant fourth 
behind Pizza Hut, Pizzaland and Deep Pan Pizza. But our offering was superior, and the public knew it. Within 10 
Titans can always be cut down to size
years, two of the three market leaders had shut down and the other has been in retreat for years. PizzaExpress, 
meanwhile, has grown 20-fold, and is now the leader. The majors were complacent and unwilling to reinvent their 
model - and suffered the consequences.
Even in fields that require significant capital there are regular launches. Legacy airlines have faced a ferocious 
assault from low-cost rivals such as Ryanair and easyJet, coming as if from nowhere to overtake national 
champions. Despite heavy regulation and fierce competition, they have succeeded by offering a no-frills service - 
demonstrating that no industry is invulnerable.
In almost every market, upstarts come along and disrupt the status quo. Technology, social shifts, deregulation and 
drive can lead to dislocation in any industry. It can be intimidating to confront businesses with long-established, 
commanding shares. But from Sir James Dyson taking on the might of Hoover in vacuum cleaners, to 
salesforce.com challenging Siebel Systems in customer relationship management, the history of capitalism has 
been forged by newcomers outcompeting bigger rivals.
Moreover many sectors are still fragmented. From catering to hairdressing, from construction to car repair, there are 
thousands of ubiquitous activities where small, family-owned concerns comprise the majority. They all represent 
ripe territory, waiting for disrupters to make their mark. Having spent 20 years in the food and drink business, I know 
that even the oldest trades are bursting with prospects.
Waves of consolidation in many sectors have come and gone. Big companies rise and die. Globalisation and the 
digital revolution have helped lower barriers to entry, and enabled fresh participants to compete in hundreds of 
sectors. Be it media, retailing, telecoms or financial services, industries that appeared unassailable have been 
turned upside down. The only constraints are the ingenuity and ambition of pioneering entrepreneurs.

 Day three of the 2013 Paris Air Show saw more than $25 billion in aircraft orders for The Boeing Company 
(NYSE:BA) and Airbus (EPA:EAD) on Wednesday, pushing total orders over the $100 billion mark with four days to 
go before the end of the expo.
 The biggest commitment reported on Wednesday came from Dublin-based discount regional carrier Ryanair 
Holdings plc (Nasdaq:RYAAY) for 175 Boeing 737-800s worth $15.6 billion[1].
 Airbus saw the second-largest order, from Air France-KLM (EPA:AF), for 25 of its A350-900s[2], the company's 
answer to Boeing's new carbon-composite Dreamliners, in a $7.2 billion deal that includes an option for 25 
additional jets.
 Other deals announced Wednesday include:
 - SriLankan Airlines, the National Airline of Sri Lanka, ordered six Airbus A330-300s with an option to add four 
A350-900s in a $2.6 billion deal. 
 - CIT Group Inc. (NYSE:CIT), a New York-based holding company involved in leasing in the aerospace industry, 
placed an order for 30 737 MAX 8s for an undisclosed amount.
 - Oman Air ordered five Boeing Next-Generation 737-900ER airplanes in a $327 million deal.
 - Czech Republic-based Travel Service ordered three 737 MAX 8s to add to its fleet of 28 Boeing 737s.
 According to flightglobal.com's latest tally[3],662 planes have been ordered and 392 have been reserved as 
options. The Embraer E-Jet E2, made by Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer SA (NYSE:ERJ), leads the pack in order 
volume while British carrier easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) has been the top buyer. Between the world's top two 
manufacturers, Airbus is leading in overall volume and in narrow-body jets while Boeing is dominating the business 
for long-haul wide-bodied jets.

(RTTNews) - Aerospace and defense giant Boeing Co.(BA) said CIT Aerospace of CIT group Inc. (CIT), a leading 
lessor in aviation industry, has placed order for 30 737 MAX 8s. The order comprises of 10 new aircraft and 
conversions of 20 existing Next-Generation 737 orders. Oman Air will buy five 737-900 ER aircraft for $473 million 
at current list prices. Menawhile, Ryanair finalized an order for 175 Next-Generation 737-800 Airplanes valued at 
$15.6 Bln at list prices, Boeing revealed in a different statement at the 50th Paris Airshow.
According to Jeffrey Knittel, president of CIT Transportation Finance, the addition of tBoeing 737 MAX 8s would 
ensure CIT Aerospace to maintain the youngest and most fuel efficient fleets.
The 737 MAX is known for advanced engine technologies and offers 13 percent fuel-burn improvement over today's 
most fuel-efficient single-aisle airplanes and an 8 percent operating cost per seat advantage. 737 MAX will be 8 
percent more fuel efficient than the A320neo. The aircraft will have a new LEAP-1B engines from CFM 
International, a redesigned tail cone and the Advanced Technology winglet.
Separately, Boeing announced that the first delivery of the 737 MAX 8 to launch customer Southwest Airlines will be 
in the third quarter of 2017, a quarter earlier than originally scheduled .
With the new order, Oman Air became the first customer in the Arabian Gulf region to order 737-900ERs. Currently, 
the airline operates a fleet of 15 Boeing Next-Generation 737-800s and two 737-700s. With this new order, the 
airline now has a backlog of six 737-800s and five 737-900ERs. In addition, Oman Air has six Boeing 787-8s on 
order.
BA is currently up 0.87 percent in pre-market trading on the Nasdaq.

another in August, the Commercial Court
Body
Aer Lingus has spent E40 million fighting off Ryanair takeover bids to date and does not want to face another in 
August, the Commercial Court has heard.
The court will deal next month with an action by Aer Lingus aimed at preventing Ryanair issuing another takeover 
bid for the national carrier in August.
Aer Lingus claims it has incurred some E40 million costs in defending Ryanair's bids to date and faces incurring 
further costs as a result of the restriction imposed on its commercial activities due to such takeover attempts.
In its action, it is challenging a ruling by the Irish Takeover Panel to the effect Ryanair had to wait 12 months after 
its August 2012 takeover bid before it could make another bid.
Aer Lingus had sought a ruling that no such bid could be launched before February 2014, 12 months after the 
European Commission's decision blocking the Ryanair bid was made. It is alleged the panel's ruling has major 
commercial implications for Aer Lingus as, when the airline is within an offer period within the meaning of the 
takeover rulings, it is very significantly restrained in its commercial operations. The Irish Times XXXX Irish-based 
aircraft and equipment leasing specialist, Apollo Aviation Group, plans to spend dollar 220 million (E165 million) 
buying aircraft, engines and components for lease to airlines in Asia, Europe and North America. The group, whose 
main operations are in Dublin where it employs 17 people, said yesterday it had agreed contracts to acquire the 
craft and equipment through the first five months of the year. The craft and equipment include two A320 CEO 
aircraft, one A330-200, one A330-300, seven B737NGs, and seven engines. Ten of these craft are leased to 
airlines in Asia, Europe and North America. The Irish Times XXXX Europe should eliminate so-called "zombie 
banks" hobbling the continent's economic recovery with a bank resolution authority underwritten by the European 
Stability Mechanism bailout fund, according to the European Central Bank. Jorg Asmussen, an ECB board member, 
Roundup- Aer Lingus spends 40m on fight News roundup
called yesterday for a European bank wind-up fund, financed by a banking levy and managed by a new institution. If 
such an institution could not be created in the short term, he said, the "second-best solution would be to temporarily 
base this authority at the ESM". If the means in this fund are insufficient, the wind-up fund could have access to a 
temporary EU emergency facility," he told an audience in Magdeburg yesterday. "The ESM would be a potential 
candidate for these tasks. The temporary help should be covered by a bank levy and, in the medium term, be 
fiscally neutral." The Irish Times XXXX The proportion of Irish mortgage holders having difficulty servicing their 
loans continues to rise, according to the latest analysis by Moody's. The performance of Irish prime residential 
mortgage-back securities continued to deteriorate in the three months to April, the ratings agency said. The 90-day 
delinquency trend reached a new peak, rising to 18.1 per cent from 17.3 per cent over the same period while the 
percentage of loans in the 360-day plus category, which is used as a proxy for defaults, rose to 9.4 per cent from 
8.5 per cent. The bonds examined by the agency constitute more than 40 per cent of the entire mortgage market. 
The agency said the rate of increase of the 30-day plus category of delinquincies was slowing but the overall 
situation is still deteriorating and the agency has maintained a negative outlook for the bonds. "The steep decline in

Body
Aer Lingus has spent E40 million fighting off Ryanair takeover bids to date and does not want to face another in 
August, the Commercial Court has heard.
The court will deal next month with an action by Aer Lingus aimed at preventing Ryanair issuing another takeover 
bid for the national carrier in August.
Aer Lingus claims it has incurred some E40 million costs in defending Ryanair's bids to date and faces incurring 
further costs as a result of the restriction imposed on its commercial activities due to such takeover attempts.
In its action, it is challenging a ruling by the Irish Takeover Panel to the effect Ryanair had to wait 12 months after 
its August 2012 takeover bid before it could make another bid.
Aer Lingus had sought a ruling that no such bid could be launched before February 2014, 12 months after the 
European Commission's decision blocking the Ryanair bid was made. It is alleged the panel's ruling has major 
commercial implications for Aer Lingus as, when the airline is within an offer period within the meaning of the 
takeover rulings, it is very significantly restrained in its commercial operations. The Irish Times XXXX Irish-based 
aircraft and equipment leasing specialist, Apollo Aviation Group, plans to spend dollar 220 million (E165 million) 
buying aircraft, engines and components for lease to airlines in Asia, Europe and North America. The group, whose 
main operations are in Dublin where it employs 17 people, said yesterday it had agreed contracts to acquire the 
craft and equipment through the first five months of the year. The craft and equipment include two A320 CEO 
aircraft, one A330-200, one A330-300, seven B737NGs, and seven engines. Ten of these craft are leased to 
airlines in Asia, Europe and North America. The Irish Times XXXX Europe should eliminate so-called "zombie

base this authority at the ESM". If the means in this fund are insufficient, the wind-up fund could have access to a

8.5 per cent. The bonds examined by the agency constitute more than 40 per cent of the entire mortgage market.

JOHN STRICKLAND
Body
Sir Howard Davies, the respected UK economist, has entered seriously turbulent airspace. As head of the Airports 
Commission, he's been tasked with drawing up a plan to save the UK's global hub status which is under ever 
increasing threat from hub airports around the world.
One of his challenges is to cut through the jungle of opinions and highly factional lobbying ranging from irate 
residents, whose homes flank the current UK hub at Heathrow, to rival airports keen to snatch a bigger share of 
business. There is also a political desire to strengthen air transport in the regions to balance out economic 
inequalities in the country and stimulate employment where it is badly needed.
Flawed recommendations leading to a political fudge would be calamitous. If the government takes the wrong 
decision, there are plenty of rival airports abroad ready to snatch the business away. This would lead to a loss of 
global hub status which would be disastrous for the UK economy.
The UK has many excellent airports of all shapes and sizes but just because some of them have ambitions to 
become a hub does not mean they have a realistic chance.
The acid test is not what some airports want but whether airlines would use them. Many have flocked to Heathrow 
like a honey pot despite its problems because they know they can fill more seats and for higher prices than 
elsewhere in the UK.
Experience shows that even other London airports would not be able to fill the gap. Many airlines have paid millions 
of pounds to get slots at Heathrow, while others have abandoned long-haul services at Gatwick and Stansted 
because the revenues have not stacked up. Some have avoided coming to the UK altogether in the absence of 
capacity at Heathrow.
Aircraftarehighlymobile assets and dynamic long-haul airlines will deploy them in other global markets if the UK 
doesn't make the grade. Successful short-haul airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair move their fleets around 
Global hub status at stake ifUKmakeswrongchoice
Europe to get the best financial return. A laudable desire to "rebalance the UK economy" will not be achieved just 
because some regional airports have the capacity and think that airlines should be obliged to use them. Airlines will 
go only where they see profitable market opportunity and sadly this is not generally the case in regions where traffic 
is more seasonal and there is not a consistent volume of lucrative, profitable business traffic to sustain most long-
haul routes.
Those routes that are viable are being flown already and are serving powerful airline hubs in the USA or, 
increasingly, in the Middle East such as Dubai, the base of Emirates.
Nor can the UK support two complementary hubs. Some say "it works in New York" but the comparison is not valid. 
There are three main airports in New York. La Guardia is largely domestic and the other two are run as separate 
operations by three large airline groups: American and Delta at JFK and United at Newark. They do not work as a 
complementary airport system.
Furthermore, we do not have three large airlines in the UK to sustain the New York model. We have one - British 
Airways - with Virgin Atlantic in a more modest supporting role. They are both advocates of Heathrow. For a hub to 
work there needs to be a maximum opportunity to provide connections between flights and only Heathrow delivers 
this profitably for the airlines.
If you do not consolidate Heathrow's role as hub, it will wither and, while waiting for another hub to appear in the 
UK, the airlines will have taken their business elsewhere.
My experience as a former airline network planner (analysing and making decisions on route choices for airlines) 
tells me there can only be one hub in the UK. I believe expanding Heathrow is the right solution for the UK 
economy, for jobs, for business and for airlines that need a hub. Of course this presents enormous challenges in 
addressing environmental concerns and those of nearby residents, but are these reasonsenoughtomakethe wrong 
recommendations, to the detriment of the UK?
Sir Howard's commission will need to confront these realities. While we await its findings the clock continues to tick. 
Dubai will overtake Heathrow as the world's busiest international airport by 2015. It is a well-conceived hub airport 
with a home carrier, Emirates, tapping into the air travel needs of key growth economies. When the current airport is 
full, Emirates will move seamlessly to the new Dubai World Central Airport. No 20-year wait, no fragmented split 
hub operation.
Even in Europe there is spare capacity at rival hubs, not least Amsterdam. Having worked for the Dutch carrier KLM 
(half of Air France-KLM), I know what an effective job it does in tempting traffic from the UK market.
Aviationisa   fundamental part of the 21st-century global economy. The Airports Commission must make 
recommendations that are supported by the global airlines that wish to serve the UK. The danger is that if the wrong 
decision is taken, then we will lose our global hub status leading to job losses rather than job increases and wealth 
creation for the country.
Even if the commission gets its recommendations right, the government may not have the courage to implement 
them. Sadly, I fear that the odds are stacked against the chances of success for the Davies commission.
I hope I am wrong as this would be a catastrophe for the UK.

Highlight:  Consolidation  Lufthansa's decision to suspend its dividend illustrates just how tough the market has 
become, says Andrew Parker
Body
For investors in US airlines, a near-decade of consolidation is starting to bring tangible benefits. Last month, Delta 
Air Lines, the second-largest carrier by revenue, announced plans to issue a dividend this year - the first such 
payout since 2003.
Contrast this with Europe where Lufthansa, the region's largest carrier by sales, in February proposed suspending 
its dividend. European airlines are struggling with a prolonged economic downturn in many of their home countries, 
but Lufthansa's move also underlined how cut-throat competition weighs heavily on the region's carriers.
In the US, consolidation that goes back to the merger of US Airways and America West in 2005 is set to culminate 
by the end of September with the expected tie-up between American Airlines and US Airways . The large eight 
airlines of 10 years ago are on course to become the big four, with reduced competition meaning that the remaining 
players have greater pricing power - the ability to raise fares after years of slashing ticket prices during market 
share grabs.
This level of market concentration means that US airline consolidation is likely to be mainly done. In Europe, there 
is a case for more mergers because there are still far too many airlines, but it may well be that the region sees a 
series of carrier collapses rather than deals.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, which was created from the merger of British Airways 
and Iberia with the intent of becoming a leading industry consolidator, said last month that he saw no opportunities 
in the short to medium term.
"It's clear there are a lot of airlines in play," he said. "Most of these are peripheral airlines that we can't see adding 
any value to the IAG group - or, in all honesty, adding any value to pretty much anybody. So we don't have any 
proposals to do anything."
The big European airline deals have already happened. Before the creation of IAG in 2011, Air France merged with 
KLM of the Netherlands in 2004, while Lufthansa combined with Swiss in 2005 and Austrian Airlines in 2009.
Concentration of carriers puts collapse on Europe agenda
These three large flag carrier groups are now busy restructuring their short-haul operations , some of which are 
lossmaking because of intense competition from low-cost airlines led by Ryanair and easyJet.
The budget airlines show no sign of letting up in their quest to increase market share at the expense of the flag 
carriers - Ryanair placed an order for 175 narrow-body aircraft worth $15.6bn at catalogue prices from Boeing in 
March, and easyJet is expected to announce a large, single-aisle jet purchase soon.
Against this backdrop, where Air France-KLM, IAG and Lufthansa are preoccupied with cutting costs rather than 
doing deals, even smaller flag carriers with a potentially valuable nichehavestruggledtoattract buyers.
The Portuguese government last December shelved the privatisation of Transportes Aéreos Portugueses, the 
country's flag carrier and one of Europe's leading airlines flying to Brazil, after only attracting one bid.
IAG and Lufthansa decided against making binding offers, in spite of both having an interest in increasing their 
presence in the fast-growing Latin American market.
Lisbon is expected to try to revive the privatisation, but even if TAP is acquired, such a deal could well be 
outnumbered by carrier collapses.
Meanwhile, with many countries having foreign ownership rules that prevent airline consolidation at a global level, 
the most notable development over the past year has been the tie-up between Qantas and Emirates Airline.
This partnership - based on a codeshare arrangement and announced last September - is providing the Australian 
flag carrier with the opportunity to try to restore its international operations to profit by scrapping lossmaking flights. 
Qantas is flying to Emirates' Dubai hub, where passengers can transfer on to the Gulf carrier's wide range of flights 
to Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
This agreement also highlights how the relatively young, state-controlled Gulf carriers are no longer viewed as 
enemy number one by longer-established airlines. After years of intense competition, some Asian and European 
carriers are forging deals with the fast-expanding Gulf airlines.
Last October, Air France-KLM, which reported a EUR1.2bn net loss in 2012, unveiled a code-share agreement with 
Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways. Later that month, the oneworld global airline alliance - led by British Airways and 
American Airlines - announced that Doha-based Qatar Airways was joining. It is the first of the big Gulf carriers to 
join an alliance.
Lufthansa, the only large European flag carrier not to reach a deal with one of these Gulf carriers, has been 
considering the case for a partnership with Turkish Airlines, the fast-growing Istanbul-based carrier.
"The combination of our two strong markets and a strong cultural fit . . . could make co-operation attractive if both 
partners can participate," said Simone Menne, Lufthansa's finance director.

CSeries pitches for slice of narrow-body jet market

Highlight: Bombardier
A lot is riding on a successful first flight, says Robert Wright
Body
The moment when a Bombardier CSeries jet taxis out on to the runway for its first flight is unlikely to be widely 
televised live, as the maiden flights of Boeing's 787 and Airbus's A380 were. But, as the first aircraft heads into the 
skies above Quebec, probably later this month, it could mark a moment every bit as significant as those higher-
profile maiden flights.
If the aircraft can meet expectations, it could transform competition in the narrow-body jet market - which accounts 
for far more aircraft sales annually than the higher-profile wide-body market in which the 787 and A380 compete. 
Success for the aircraft would disrupt the duopoly in narrow-body jets between Boeing's 737 family of aircraft and 
Airbus's A320. Bombardier of Canada, already the world's third-largest commercial aircraft maker by sales, would 
become a far more important force.
The manufacturer nevertheless has been struggling to persuade customers that the CSeries will meet their needs. 
It has so far won only 145 firm orders against a target of 300 by the time the aircraft enters service in mid-2014.
Since Bombardier first announced plans for the aircraft in 2004, Airbus and Boeing have announced new, more 
fuel-efficient versions of their narrow-body models - the A320neo and Boeing 737 Max - intended to satisfy some of 
the demand that the CSeries originally aimed at meeting.
Guy Hachey, chief operating officer of Bombardier Aerospace, insists, however, that the order levels are similar to 
those for other launches of new, unproven aircraft designs ahead of first flight. The maiden flight will win over 
doubters, he says.
"People want to know if it's true," Mr Hachey says of the claims made for new types. "We're going to fly by the end 
of the month. Then we can prove to the world that Bombardier has done it, definitely."
CSeries pitches for slice of narrow-body jet market
Questions over the aircraft's performance - and whether it provides a sufficient edge over Boeing's and Airbus's 
rival aircraft - are likely to be far more significant for the programme's future than development delays, according to 
Mr Hachey. The company announced a six-month delay to the planned first flight in November last year .
"With a programme such as the CSeries, if you're going to be moving milestones by a few months, it's not really 
considered to be late," Mr Hachey says, adding that first flight for many other new commercial jet types in recent 
years has been years late.
The scale of the commercial problem facing the CSeries was clear in March when Michael O'Leary, chief executive 
of Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier that is one of the world's largest operators of narrow-body aircraft, came to 
New York.
Mr O'Leary was in the city to sign an order with Boeing for at least 175 of its 737-800 aircraft . When asked whether 
he would consider switching from the 737 to Airbus's A320, he indicated that the 180 seats of the largest A320 were 
inadequate for Ryanair's needs and that the carrier much preferred operating the 189-seat capacity of the 737-800.
Mr O'Leary's stance illustrates how many operators of narrow-body aircraft want to pack in as many passengers as 
possible to cover the high costs of operating aircraft over relatively short distances.
"We've always held the view that we would like a slightly larger aircraft," Mr O'Leary said. "If Boeing had a way of 
getting another 10 seats on to the Boeing 737-800, that would be the perfect sweet spot."
Mr O'Leary's stance illustrates the risk that customers could opt for the higher-capacity but new and more fuel-
efficient 737 and A320 variants over the CSeries.
Nevertheless, Mr Hachey insists there is a market for aircraft of the CSeries size that has gone largely 
unaddressed. Most of the variants will carry between just over 100 passengers and 149.
"That was a market that was not served by our competition," Mr Hachey says. "We feel comfortable that this market 
segment does exist."
He adds, however, that some customers have expressed interest in a potential larger CSeries aircraft seating up to 
160 passengers.
"That gives even more economies of scale, with an aircraft that already has low operating costs," Mr Hachey says.
The immediate challenge, however, is to ensure that the CSeries avoids the technical problems that prolonged the 
flight-testing programmes of the 787 and A380.
There is significant potential for risk. Many of the aircraft's fuel savings come from its use of Pratt & Whitney's new 
geared turbofan engine - a jet engine that, unusually, has gears to keep the intake fan and internal turbines running 
at different speeds . Parts of the wing fairings will be made of light aluminium lithium alloys that have previously not 
been widely used for commercial aircraft.
Mr Hachey says, however, that there has been substantial testing of both the novel materials and the new engine to 
ensure that both work well when installed on the aircraft. The company considered but rejected the technology that 
has posed most problems for Boeing with its 787 - the lithium-ion batteries that twice suffered severe overheating 
and in one case a fire in aircraft in January , leading to the entire fleet's grounding.
Mr Hachey hopes that the cautious approach should ensure that, when engineers start examining data from this 
month's first flight, they will reveal results that help to boost the type's sales.
"The technology we're bringing to the market is proven technology, although we have some new technology," Mr 
Hachey says. "We're very comfortable with where we are."

The proximity of Normandy to Paris has made the northern French region a favourite weekend retreat for residents 
of the capital - and particularly those with an interest in horses, given the region's myriad equestrian clubs and its 
concentration of stud farms.
Normandy has attracted British horse lovers, too. In 2000, Nicky and Steve Bodman moved from Warwickshire to 
an 18th-century farmhouse near the village of Saint-Siméon, with 30 acres of land including an ancient standing 
stone and burial ground. The property also came with three guest houses the couple now rent out.
When they first moved to France, with their two horses, the Bodmans spent several months renting a house in the 
Limousin region of south-central France. "It was beautiful but the flies ate the horses alive and there was also a 
problem with ticks. When we moved to Normandy we found a home with a barn that we could convert into stables, 
and a gentler climate. As a result, the horses were happier," says Nicky Bodman.
The Bodmans' property is in Lower Normandy, administratively a separate region to Upper Normandy, and 
generally more rural and bucolic than its neighbour (around Le Havre and Rouen there is some heavy industry).
The area also benefits from varied housing stock, with granite and slate common inland, and half-timbered homes 
nearer the coast. But its attractiveness as a good place to retire has led to an ageing population, or "papy-boom". 
According to the French National Institute of Statistics, 18 per cent of the region's residents are 65 or older, up from 
14 per cent in 1990.
The upmarket seaside town of Deauville is the region's property hotspot, says Nathalie Garcin, of the Emile Garcin 
estate agency. The pretty town has a wide bathing beach and is sometimes called the "21st arrondissement of 
Paris" because of its popularity with buyers from the French capital.
"The market has been at a virtual standstill since October of last year," says Garcin. "But the return of fine weather 
in the spring, after such a long winter, and the drop in house prices, has encouraged buyers to arrange viewings."
Eroded confidence France property Make a low offer in Normandy and cross your fingers. By Nick Foster
Horseracing and polo are hugely popular in Deauville, which is also where fashion designer Coco Chanel opened a 
boutique in 1913. An increasing number of Russian visitors can now be seen shopping at high-end outlets in the 
town, which has long attracted a well-heeled British, Dutch and German crowd.
Some locals would prefer for it to stay that way. In 2006, campaigners tried to stop Ryanair operating flights from 
the UK to the town's diminutive airport, citing aircraft noise concerns. CityJet runs a seasonal service to Deauville 
from London City airport, but in Normandy low-cost carriers are still notable by their absence.
A mixed brick and half-timbered four-bedroom house, a heated outdoor pool, and 1,550 sq metres of grounds close 
to Deauville's golf course is offered by Emile Garcin for EUR1.57m.
Despite local mortgage interest rates being at historically low levels, PrimeView, a Paris-based economic consulting 
company, predicts that French house prices will fall "at least 30 per cent over the next five to 10 years" from their 
high point in the summer of 2011. In a report drawn up last year, PrimeView noted that France was still "in the 
throes of a very large property bubble". But with the numbers of transactions falling across France - not in the Cote 
d'Azur and central Paris but in many rural areas and small towns - property professionals in the country increasingly 
concede that this might be the calm before the storm.
For potential buyers in places such as the charming Pays d'Auge, a pretty area south of Deauville and famous for 
its cheese and cider, the question is surely: is this the right time to make a move? The once rather frothy property 
market here has already had two lean years and there is no reason to think prices will move in an upwards direction 
anytime soon. The winding country lanes - perfect for walking, cycling or riding - have a timeless feel, but in some 
villages the shops and bars are feeling the pinch and opting to close down as a result of la crise . In Normandy as in 
much of rural France, this could be a summer for finding a house, making a low offer and crossing your fingers.
With its oval-shaped central square ringed by beautiful, half-timbered buildings, Beuvron-en-Auge is one of the 
Pays d'Auge's most attractive villages. Here, a four-bedroom, two-bathroom house - built in 2009 but in a traditional 
style with a steeply sloping roof and exposed beams inside - is on the market for EUR690,000 through the Orpi 
estate agency.
Buyers looking for a property to modernise should budget for about EUR1,000 per sq metre for basic renovation 
including new plumbing, heating and rewiring, says Nathalie Garcin, but luxury fittings and using specialist 
craftsmen could double this figure.
Although Normandy's coastline is generally less dramatic than that of its neighbour, Brittany, the pretty seaside 
resort of Étretat, south of Dieppe, with its shingle beach framed by spectacular cliffs which have eroded into pillars 
and arches, is an exception. The town has a less exclusive feel than Deauville but has an artistic heritage all its 
own, helping it to attract a clutch of impressionist painters such as Claude Monet and, crise or no crise , second-
home buyers today. A six-bedroom, six-bathroom detached house outside Étretat, with 8,000 sq metres of grounds, 
is available for EUR960,000 through Square Habitat. Meanwhile, the average price for a two-bedroom terraced 
fisherman's cottage in the town is about EUR120,000. They may be of modest size but have good potential as 
holiday rentals.

PASSENGERS across Europe endured a second day of delays and cancellations yesterday, but have been spared 
further chaos after French air traffic controllers called off a third day of strike action.
EasyJet and Ryanair were forced to scrap hundreds of flights between them, while other carriers including British 
Airways were caught up in knock-on disruption.
French authorities estimated that up to half of all flights were axed yesterday.
Thousands of routes to and from major French airports were affected by the industrial action, which was called in 
response to the European Union's plan to centrally regulate airspace across the continent.
Air traffic controllers have complained that the plan will cost jobs.
The so-called single sky plan aims to save up to (EURO)5bn (£4.25bn) a year by resolving "inefficiencies in 
Europe's fragmented airspace", the European Commission said earlier this week.
"It puts safety in the European sky only as a second priority, in favour of the economic aspects," Riccardo Rubini, 
from the European Transport Workers' Federation, said.

 A plan to bring the European Union under a 'Single European Sky' prompted widespread strikes that began in 
France Tuesday, but will expand in varying degrees to 10 other nations across the continent Wednesday.
 Workers who walked off the job Tuesday did so to protest the EU proposal to centralize control of the continent's 
airspace, a move designed to reduce duplication of work in the bloc's 28 nations. The unions fear that if the plan 
comes to fruition, air traffic controllers will lose jobs or their wages will be slashed. France's air traffic controller 
union, SNCTA, backed by the European Transport Workers' Federation, or ETF, called for expanded walkouts 
across Europe on Wednesday, but canceled a planned third day of strikes on Thursday, citing opposition from the 
French and German governments to the EU proposal. 
 French Transport Minister Frederic Cuvillier announced Monday that he and his German counterpart had delivered 
a memorandum to the European transport commissioner asking the European executive to freeze the project. The 
national authorities, both ministers said, needed more time to adapt to the plan.
 The Brussels-based European Commission, however, pushed ahead Tuesday, saying inefficiencies in Europe's 
fragmented airspace bring extra costs of close to 5 billion euros each year to airlines and their customers and add 
42 kilometers to the distance of an average flight, 'forcing aircraft to burn more fuel, generate more emissions, pay 
more in costly user charges and suffer greater delays.' It said air traffic charges were nearly double those in the 
similarly sized U.S. airspace.
 'Our airlines and their passengers have had to endure more than 10 years of reduced services and missed 
deadlines on the route to a Single European Sky. We cannot afford to continue this way,' EU Transport 
Commissioner Siim Kallas said Tuesday. 'Today we are strengthening the nuts and bolts of the system so it can 
withstand more pressure and deliver ambitious reforms even in difficult economic times.'
 Member states and European Parliament must approve the commission's proposal before it becomes a law in a 
process that could take a year or more. Air France-KLM, the continent's biggest carrier, and Ryanair, its largest low-
cost operator, have both called for a speedy end to Europe's hodgepodge air traffic control systems.
 'It is unacceptable that the skies over Europe are repeatedly closed or flights are delayed by the unjustified strike 
action of tiny numbers of air traffic controllers,' Robin Kiely, head of communications at Ryanair, said Monday. 
'These public servants are among the most overpaid and protected in Europe and yet they repeatedly opt for the 
strike weapon as a first, rather than a last resort.'
 The International Air Transport Association also lashed out against the strikes, while welcoming the European 
Commission's proposal. Tony Tyler, IATA's director general and CEO, said air travelers 'should not be held hostage 
by ETF resistance to critical change.'
European Airport Strikes Expand Beyond France
 'The fears of the ETF, which represents only a portion of European air traffic control officers, are completely 
misguided,' he stated Tuesday. 'The commission shares the industry's frustration with the failure of European states 
to progress the SES [Single European Sky]. Every year that SES languishes in limbo is a 5 billion euro knock to 
European competitiveness and costs the environment 8.1 million tons of wasted carbon emissions.'
 Cancellations And Delays
 Some 1,800 flights in and out of France were canceled Tuesday due to the strikes, accounting for about a fourth of 
all scheduled trips. Included in the Civil Aviation Authority's contingency plan was a request that all airlines serving 
Charles de Gaulle, Orly, Bordeaux, Beauvais, Lyon, Nice, Marseille and Toulouse airports trim their schedules to 
about half the normal flights. Consequently, airlines like Lufthansa, Air France, Easyjet and Ryanair nixed most 
short- and medium-haul flights, but maintained their more lucrative long-haul schedules.
 Air France said last-minute delays and cancellations were to be expected Wednesday, but promised to maintain all 
long-haul flights to and from Paris. 'As the strike action has been lifted, Air France expects to return to normal flight 
operations during the morning of Thursday 13 June,' the carrier said on its website Tuesday evening.
 Delays and cancellations Wednesday could grow even larger, according to the ETF. The organization said late 
Tuesday that air traffic controllers in Hungary would join French workers in a work stoppage, while controllers in 
Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia and the Czech Republic would work to rule, performing only the tasks that fall 
within their remit during contractual hours. Controllers in Austria, Bulgaria, Latvia and the UK may also take similar 
actions, the organization said.
 Ryanair noted that it had pre-emptively canceled 130 flights for Wednesday, while Lufthansa axed more than 170 
and Easyjet nixed 128. Air France, meanwhile, had not yet released the number of flights it would scrap from its 
schedule Tuesday evening.
 All travelers flying through European airspace are encouraged to check for updates directly through airlines' 
websites and social media. Under European Union regulations, all passengers are entitled to either a full refund of 
the unused portion of a canceled flight or a chance to be re-routed to a destination as soon as possible, though 
many airlines also offer rebooking at a later date at no additional cost. Regulations also state that, when a flight on 
an EU airline or from an EU airport is canceled, the airline is liable to pay for the cost of a hotel and subsistence, 
within reason.

A STRIKE by French air traffic controllers prompted airlines to cancel hundreds of flights into and out of the UK 
yesterday, with more delays expected today and tomorrow.
Heathrow Airport said around 30 of its services, mostly run by British Airways and Air France, had been cancelled 
ahead of time yesterday, and additional delays were possible.
EasyJet and Ryanair also called off dozens of flights each.
In total, around 1,800 flights were axed from French airports including the Charles de Gaulle hub in Paris. Up to half 
of French services are expected to be scrapped between yesterday and Thursday.
Preparations for the maiden flight of Europe's newest passenger jet, the Airbus A350, were also affected by fallout 
from the strike, French sources told Reuters.
The three-day strike was called by air traffic controllers to protest against the EU's plans to centrally regulate all 
European airspace.
The so-called single sky plan aims to save up to (EURO)5bn a year by resolving "inefficiencies in Europe''s 
fragmented airspace", the European Commission said.
"We cannot afford to continue this way," said EU transport commissioner Siim Kallas yesterday. "[W]e are

French Airport Strikes To Clog European Travel For 3 Days
French Airport Strikes To Clog European Travel For 3 Days

 Travelers crossing through Europe by air are about to hit a three-day patch of turbulence as air traffic controllers in 
France initiate a widespread protest Tuesday against a proposal by the European Commission to accelerate the 
integration of air traffic management systems across the continent. While France will be the epicenter of delays and 
cancellations through early Friday morning, many other European countries are expected to see more limited labor 
actions this week that could exacerbate delays.
 Contingency plans are well under way, including a request by France's civil aviation authority that airlines serving 
Paris, Bordeaux, Lyon, Nice, Marseille and Toulouse slash their schedules by at least 50 percent.
 Air France said Monday afternoon that it expected to transport all of its customers on long-haul flights to and from 
Paris Tuesday. It recommended that all travelers with a reservation on short- and medium-haul flights, however, 
postpone their trips during this period at no extra cost, as 'last-minute delays and cancellations can be expected.'
 'Air France is doing everything to minimize the inconvenience this strike action may cause,' the airline said. 'Airport 
teams and Air France commercial staff remain mobilized to inform customers.'
 The French flag carrier said it would notify customers of delays and cancellations on their mobile phones or by 
email and its AF Connect service, which is available in 13 languages for passengers worldwide.
 Lufthansa, meanwhile, said delays and cancellations of flights into and out of France were to be expected through 
Thursday. The German airline had already axed nearly 160 flights[1] Monday evening, and said affected 
passengers could refund or rebook their flights free of charge online or at a call center.
 Low-cost carrier Easyjet said it was forced to preemptively cancel approximately 128 flights for each day of the 
strike, which is set to begin at 6 a.m. local time on Tuesday and continue through Friday at 5:59 a.m. Thirty-five of 
those flights were scheduled into or out of Paris Orly and Paris Charles de Gaulle, while Nice had 17 departures 
and arrivals, Toulouse 11, and Lyon nine.
 All passengers scheduled to travel on canceled flights will be advised via email, and details of the cancellations can 
be found on Easyjet's Flight Tracker[2] webpage. Affected customers are eligible for a full refund or free transfer to 
another flight.
 Low-cost rival Ryanair canceled[3] 102 scheduled flights for Tuesday. The carrier said it would announce flight 
cancellations for Wednesday and Thursday as needed 24 hours ahead of time. All affected passengers will be 
notified by email or SMS with information detailing their rerouting or refund options.
 Ryanair publicly condemned the EU Commission's 'continuing failure to act on its repeated call for the removal of 
the right to strike from Europe's air traffic controllers, who are again attempting to blackmail Europe's passengers 
with strikes.'
French Airport Strikes To Clog European Travel For 3 Days
 'It is unacceptable that the skies over Europe are repeatedly closed or flights are delayed by the unjustified strike 
action of tiny numbers of air traffic controllers,' said Robin Kiely, head of communications at Ryanair. 'These public 
servants are among the most overpaid and protected in Europe and yet they repeatedly opt for the strike weapon 
as a first, rather than a last resort.'
 Kiely said the solution to the problem was simple: Remove their right to strike in the same way that air traffic 
controllers in the U.S. are prevented by law from striking. 'Until then, it is up to the EU Commission and French 
government to ensure there are no further cancellations on Wednesday and Thursday as a result of these 
unwarranted strikes.'
 The demonstration was scheduled to coincide with a speech planned for Tuesday by the European Union's 
transportation commissioner, Siim Kallas, who is expected to announce changes to European legislation that would 
speed the transfer of responsibility for a number of air traffic management functions away from the European 
Union's member states to a central body in Brussels. Included in the proposal are stricter performance-
improvement goals for air traffic controllers aimed at lowering management fees and reducing congestion.
 The Brussels-based European Transport Workers' Federation, which represents more than 25,000 workers 
involved in air-traffic management, has indicated that unions in more than a half dozen countries, including Belgium, 
Hungary, Italy and Portugal, could join in the protests. These actions, however, would likely provoke delays more 
than outright cancellations.
 All travelers flying through European airspace over the next three days are encouraged to check for updates 
directly through airlines' websites and social media. Under European Union regulations, all passengers are entitled 
to either a full refund of the unused portion of a canceled flight or a chance to be re-routed to a destination as soon 
as possible, though many airlines also offer rebooking at a later date at no additional cost. Regulations also state 
that, when a flight on an EU airline or from an EU airport is canceled, the airline is liable to pay for the cost of a 
hotel and subsistence, within reason.

Another Phony Jobs Report From a Government That Lies About Everything[66]
 The payroll jobs report for May released today continues the fantasy.
 Goods producing jobs declined, with manufacturing losing another 4,000 jobs, but the New Economy produced 
179,000 service jobs.
Gates of Vienna News Feed 6/9/2013
 Are these jobs the high-powered, high-wage  innovation jobs  that economists promised would be our reward from 
Globalism. I m afraid not.
 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the jobs created are the usual lowly paid non-exportable domestic 
service jobs   the jobs of a third world country.
 Retail trade accounts for 27,700 of the jobs. Wholesale trade accounts for 7,900 jobs. Ambulatory health care 
services accounts for 15,300 of the jobs. Waitresses and bartenders account for 38,100 of the jobs. Local 
government accounts for 13,000 of the jobs. Amusements, gambling, and recreation account for 12,500 of the jobs. 
Temporary help services provided 25,600 jobs. Business support services provided 4,300 jobs. Services to 
buildings and dwellings provided 6,400 jobs. Accounting and bookkeeping services provided 3,100 jobs. 
Architectural and engineering services provided 4,900 jobs. Computer systems design and related provided 6,000 
jobs (most likely filled by H-1B work visas). Management and technical consulting services provided 3,200 jobs. For 
a decade this has been the jobs profile of  the world s most powerful economy.  It is the profile of third world India 
40 years ago. The jobs that made the US the dominant economy have been moved off shore by corporations 
threatened by Wall Street with takeovers if they did not increase their profits 
 But are the jobs really there?
 With retail sales going nowhere, why 35,600 new jobs in wholesale and retail trade?

Eurozone Crisis: The Great Depression[68]
 Do Rzeczy Varsovie
 European leaders seem unable to break the cycle of recession and unemployment, despite public pressure to 
abandon the austerity regime imposed under German rule. Meanwhile, the EU s influence in the world is on the 
slide.

 European leaders are great at introducing new laws, but for several years now they have been unable to resolve 
an economic crisis. Economic growth figures released recently by Eurostat sound like a death sentence; Europe, 
you are racing towards the abyss and the brakes have stopped working long ago.
 In the first three months of 2013, the Eurozone economy shrunk by 1 per cent year-on-year, and the EU-27 s 
economy contracted by 0.7 per cent. Virtually everyone is in the red: Greece down 5.3 per cent, Cyprus, 4.1 per 
cent, Portugal, 3.9 per cent, Italy, 2.3 per cent, Spain down 2 per cent. Finland and the Netherlands also saw 
negative growth, while Austria stalled. France is now officially in recession. German growth was positive, but only in 
quarter-to-quarter terms. It is all despair and misery.
 Sparkurs vs. Austerity
 While Europe is gnashing its teeth and crying, others are leaving the stormy waters. The United States, for 
instance, vilified in the past by many European politicians because it was there that the global crisis began, brought 
about by the greediness and irresponsibility of US banks. And today   what an ingratitude   the United States is 
growing while Europe is shrinking

American Somalis Protest Against South Africa Mistreatment of Fellow Somalis[70]
 Posted by Ann Corcoran on June 8, 2013
 This is an interesting turn of events. Just this morning I wrote about Somalis in South Africa protesting the  
xenophobic  treatment of Somali migrants by other black people in the Rainbow Nation, here.
 Now comes news (really only the photo below, I couldn t find a story) about a protest in Columbus, Ohio (one of the 
largest Somali resettlement sites in the US) in support of Somalis in South Africa and against the government there.
 American Somalis should tell Obama to put pressure on the African National Congress to be more welcoming 
when he visits there later this month, after all that s what the Rainbow Nation idea was all about. Right?

Calls to Close Guantánamo  Hypocritical , Says Justice Scalia[72]
  When [Europeans] protest over Guantánamo detainees, I reply  Will you take some?  The answer is always no 
 ROME    Judicial activism is an abuse of power and undermines the judges  claim to be the legitimate final arbiter 
of the meaning of the law . Justice Antonin Scalia will make the point this morning in Turin in the Discorso Bruno 
Leoni, the lecture organised by the Istituto Bruno Leoni for the centenary of the liberal philosopher s birth. The US 
supreme court judge and leading light of conservative thought will talk about the relationship of democracy, judicial 
activism and the free market. He will be pointing the finger, as directly and as explicitly as ever, at the trendy 
political agendas that lead many judges to underplay constitutional protection of economic rights. Justice Scalia is 
referring to the United States but his message on the need for judges to take a greater interest in the property rights 
and economic freedoms enshrined in the US constitution has the ring of a universal appeal.
 We spoke on the phone to Antonin (Nino) Scalia, born in 1936 in Trenton, New Jersey, of Sicilian immigrant 
parents, on the eve of his address in Turin.
 Mr Justice, President Obama recently stated that like all wars, the war on terrorism will have to come to an end, 
also conceding that over these years the United States has been in conflict with its own principles. Do you believe 
that after 9/11, the United States has failed, in the name of security, to follow its own constitution?
  Our constitution protects non-Americans when they are in America but does not limit the government s actions 
abroad, except when American citizens are involved. That s the law. Obviously, the president decides what policy 
the military should follow .
 But are there no universal rights?
  I do not apply universal rights. It s my job to apply American law as expressed in the constitution and in the laws 
passed by Congress. I do not apply the laws of God or of anyone who promulgates so-called international law

Campus Bans Guns, Tells People to Nod at Attackers[74]
 Public safety officer says gesture will show  you are aware of their presence 
 (Daily Caller) In lieu of guns, people who find themselves in dangerous situations at or near the University of 
Arkansas at Little Rock should defend themselves by glancing and nodding, said a university safety expert.
 Earlier this year, the Arkansas legislature approved a concealed carry law, but gave school administrators 
permission to override the law and ban guns on campuses. Most Arkansas universities, including the University of 
Arkansas and Arkansas State University, opted to prohibit concealed carry, according to The College Fix.

Doug Hagmann Tells Seminar Three Major Crisis Events Are Imminent[76]
 National Insecurity Seminar: Killing off the United Sates dollar, World War Three, War against Christianity.
 Doug described three major crisis events about to take place and said they are in no particular order.
 I. Killing off the United Sates dollar
 The killing off of the United Sates dollar. Doug said this was an active maneuver.
 People in power have been actually killing our economy since 1913, the year of the Federal Reserve. It s an end 
game we re watching, he said. A Cyprus type situation could be expected soon in the U.S., he added.
 II. The start of World War Three
 The start of World War Three. Doug asked if people heard of Benghazi? It s not about a video he said, explaining it 
was part of the  Arab Spring  and was a logistics station for weapons smuggling from Libya to Syria. It s Obama s 
agenda, Valerie Jarrett s agenda to topple Assad, he explained 
Gates of Vienna News Feed 6/9/2013
 III. War against Christianity
 Doug said,  Our government is going to step up the war against Christians. They are going to do it by legal means,  
and cited how the 501C IRS delays were not just against the Tea Party.  War against Christianity,  is how Doug 
described it. Doug described it as a war against people who should take an active role.
 Doug explained how the total thrown around about the dead in Syria right now is around 80,000. When World War 
III starts, there may be one million deaths there. Service members could be exposed to hideous things. Doug 
described how he wouldn t want any of his family to be in the service now.  I never thought I d say that,  he added.
 One of the things they are doing Doug described, is  To kill off our nation while you watch. 
 [ ]
 Doug explained how people in the media and general public misuse the term  consulate  in relation to the Benghazi 
compound,  It was a CIA compound, not a consulate , Doug said.  What we saw in Benghazi was a Saudi 
operation. 
 Doug said,  Obama s network of criminals is now being exposed.  He held up the USA Today weekend edition, 
with  Spying Eyes  headlined on the front page. Doug went on to discuss Obama s shady associations with Bill 
Ayers and others such as Valerie Jarrett, saying  The USA is a captured operation. Saudi compromised, a Saudi 
captured operation. 
  Obama, in my view, is a Manchurian Candidate,  Doug said.

Edward Snowden: The Whistleblower Behind Revelations of NSA Surveillance[78]
 The 29-year-old source behind the biggest intelligence leak in US history explains his motives, his uncertain future 
and why he never intended on hiding in the shadows
 The individual responsible for one of the most significant leaks in US political history is Edward Snowden, a 29-
year-old former technical assistant for the CIA and current employee of the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton. 
Snowden has been working at the National Security Agency for the last four years as an employee of various 
outside contractors, including Booz Allen and Dell.
 The Guardian, after several days of interviews, is revealing his identity at his request. From the moment he decided 
to disclose numerous top-secret documents to the public, he was determined not to opt for the protection of 
anonymity.  I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong,  he said

Elementary School to Hold Toy Gun Exchange[80]
 We ve all heard of gun buybacks, but how about a toy gun buyback? Strobridge Elementary School in Hayward, 
California will host a toy gun buyback this Saturday. Children who turn in their toy guns will be entered for a chance 
to win a bicycle, so it s less of a buyback and more like an expensive raffle.
 Charles Hill, the school s principal, explained,  Playing with toys guns, saying  I m going to shoot you,  desensitizes 
them, so as they get older, it s easier for them to use a real gun. 
 The event, dubbed Strobridge Elementary Safety Day, will feature a Hayward police officer talking about gun and 
bicycle safety.
 But not everybody is convinced that the buyback is a good idea.  Having a group of children playing cops and 
robbers or cowboys and Indians is a normal part of growing up,  said Yih-Chau Chang of the pro-gun group 
Responsible Citizens of California..  While the intentions are obviously good on the part of the school 
administration, this doesn t really educate children about guns or gun safety. Guns are used in crimes, but they are 
more often used in defensive ways which prevent violent crime from occurring in the first place. 
 He also points out that toy guns are so visually different from real guns that vilifying toy guns won t have much of 
an impact.
Gates of Vienna News Feed 6/9/2013
 Hill disagrees.  Some of the guns I ve confiscated, if they re stuck down in a waistband, the average person would 
think it s a real gun,  he said.  I could easily see one of our sixth-graders wanting to fake out someone at a 7-Eleven 
by walking in there. They would think it s funny, but it could turn into tragedy.

Heat-Seeking, Alien-Hunting Telescope Could be Ready in 5 Years[82]
 We might find aliens through the heat their civilizations give off, astronomers say, but it will take a megatelescope 
to do the job. Such a telescope, in fact, is planned.
 The telescope   called Colossus   would be a massive 250-foot (77 meters) telescope, which is more than double 
the aperture of any telescope yet constructed.
 To keep costs down, the proposed $1 billion telescope would use thin mirror technology and few large aperture 
mirror segments. The sensitivity of the scope, though, could be enough to spot cities or other signs of aliens for 
planets as far as 60 to 70 light-years from Earth, its backers said.
  If we had an investor come and say  look, here are the resources you need,  we could have the telescope built 
within five years,  said Jeff Kuhn, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii s Institute for Astronomy, who is on the 
proposal team.

Judge Napolitano: Tyranny is Just Around the Corner[84]
 A few weeks ago, President Obama advised graduates at Ohio State University that they need not listen to voices 
warning about tyranny around the corner, because we have self-government in America. His argument defies logic 
and 20th-century history. History has shown that the majority will not permit any higher law, logic or value   such as 
fidelity to the natural law, a belief in the primacy of the individual or an acceptance of the supremacy of the 
Constitution   that prevents it from doing as it wishes. Under Mr. Obama s watch, the majority has, by active vote or 
refusal to interfere, killed hundreds of innocents   including four Americans   by drone; permitted federal agents to 
write their own search warrants; bombed Libya into tribal lawlessness without a declaration of war so that a mob 
there killed our ambassador with impunity; attempted to force 
 [85]
Lessons of Evil   The Allure of  Free [86]
 In  The High Cost of  Free,  Lloyd S. Pettegrew and Carol A. Vance report that in the Denver arena where Mr. 
Obama gave his DNC 2008 acceptance speech,
   a woman in the audience became overwhelmed by the speech and said that she no longer needed to worry if she 
could make her car or mortgage payments because he would take care of it for her. In Cleveland, a woman claimed 
that she was going to vote for President Obama again because he gave her a free cellphone (along with a litany of 
other entitlement giveaways).  (Ludwig von Mises Institute, June 5, 2013)

 The systematic murder of millions of people in the former Soviet Union was primarily facilitated by two things. First 
by scientifically animalizing  others,  the objects of hatred, resentment and envy. This was achieved by application 
of the Darwinian biological and zoological strain of thinking that ultimately enabled Marxists to justify their 
monstrous crimes against humanity. Second, by maliciously whipping up and enflaming covetousness/envy within 
the hearts of the  oppressed. 
 In 1956, Ludwig von Mises exposed the rottenness of envy and resentment fueling the paradoxical reasoning of 
people who are favorably disposed toward socialism rather than capitalism:
  It is paradoxical indeed that the leaders of these Oriental peoples, while casting longing glances at the prosperity 
of the Western nations, reject the methods that made the West prosperous and are enraptured by Russian 
Gates of Vienna News Feed 6/9/2013
communism that is instrumental in keeping the Russians and their satellites poor. It is still more paradoxical that 
Americans, enjoying the products of capitalistic big business, exalt the Soviet system and consider it quite  natural  
that the poor nations of Asia and Africa should prefer communism to capitalism.  (Reactionary Socialism, Mises 
Daily, Dec. 12, 2011)
 Those who prefer the legal plunder or redistributionist policies of socialism,
   are blinded by envy and ignorance. They stubbornly refuse to study economics and spurn the economists  
devastating critique of the socialist plans because, in their eyes, economics, being an abstract theory, is simply 
nonsense. They pretend to trust only in experience. But they no less stubbornly refuse to take cognizance of the 
undeniable facts of experience, viz., that the common man s standard of living is incomparably higher in capitalistic 
American than in the socialist paradise of the Soviets.  (ibid)
 [ ]
  Atheist teachers in the West are bringing up a younger generation in a spirit of hatred of their own society. Amid all 
the vituperation we forget that the defects of capitalism represent the basic flaws of human nature, allowed 
unlimited freedom together with the various human rights; we forget that under Communism (and Communism is 
breathing down the neck of all moderate forms of socialism, which are unstable) the identical flaws run riot in any 
person with the least degree of authority; while everyone else under that system does indeed attain  equality    the 
equality of destitute slaves. This eager fanning of the flames of hatred is becoming the mark of today s free world. 
Indeed, the broader the personal freedoms are, the higher the level of prosperity or even of abundance   the more 
vehement, paradoxically, does this blind hatred become. The contemporary developed West thus demonstrates by 
its own example that human salvation can be found neither in the profusion of material goods nor in merely making 
money.  Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

Lindsey Graham s Big Week: Loves NSA Spying, Not Sure the 1st Amendment Applies to You.[88]

Living in the Government s Fishbowl[90]
 You have to wonder why all the data gathering by the National Security Agency, Homeland Security, and the FBI 
failed to identify and surveil the perpetrators of the Boston Marathon bombing?
 When even the Russians warned national security authorities about the Chechen brothers, Dzhokan and Tamerlan 
Tsaraev, they were reportedly interviewed and then ignored 
 S.T. Karnick, the Director of Research for The Heartland Institute, a Chicago-based, free market think tank, said,  
The audacity of monitoring everyone s phone calls in hopes of catching a small number of terrorists demonstrated 
the unconstitutionality and self-contradiction at the heart of the mass government surveillance. There is no probable 
cause for which to search any particular individual s call records, merely a probability that someone somewhere 
used a telephone to assist in the planning or commission of a crime.

Maher and the Liberals Defend NSA Surveillance Grid[92]
 Bill Maher trusts Obama to use the NSA s surveillance grid to find terrorists and crazies with nuclear bombs.  We 
live in a world of nuclear weapons and there are religious fanatics who would love to get one and set it off here,  he 
said on Friday night.
 Bill Maher said he s scared and that s why he supports turning America into a Stasi surveillance state. He wants 
the rest of us to be scared, too, so we ll support the government.  You know, the fact that a city can be just 
demolished in one second kind of tips the scale for me. So, I m not saying to look into your emails is the right thing, 
I m just saying, I m not going to pretend it s because I m brave; it s because I m scared,  he said.
 This is nonsense. Does Maher really think terrorists plotting to nuke New York or Philadelphia would make plans 
using an iPhone or Gmail? Is he really that stupid? I don t think so. Bill Maher is a propaganda tool used by the 
establishment. He gets on HBO and says what the establishment tells him to say. Otherwise he wouldn t be on

NSA Snooping: Who to Blame and What to Do[94]
 Remember what I said in my column last week:  There s no question such snooping will provide the potential for 
violating attorney client privilege, doctor to patient communications, husband and wife communications, 
communications via email between judges and other specific confidences that have always been held sacrosanct.  
It s a done deal.
 Of course, now that their illegal activities have been exposed, the vile rats who hold the power in Washington, DC, 
are doing their best to keep the truth from we the people:
 Holder invokes  military and state secrets privilege   Saying even if they are violating the Constitution   no court can 
stop them 
 Their arrogance knows no bounds. Their lust for power rivals that of Hilter, Mao, Stalin, Lenin and other despots.
 Justice Department Fights Release of Secret Court Opinion Finding Unconstitutional Surveillance (June 7, 2013)
  In the midst of revelations that the government has conducted extensive top-secret surveillance operations to 
collect domestic phone records and internet communications, the Justice Department was due to file a court motion 
Friday in its effort to keep secret an 86-page court opinion that determined that the government had violated the 
spirit of federal surveillance laws and engaged in unconstitutional spying. 
 [ ]
 The putative president said this last week:   You can t have 100% security and 100% privacy  and zero 
inconvenience,  Obama said.  We re going to have to make some choices as a society.   Spoken like a true 
totalitarian dictator. Stupidly, millions of adult Americans will support such tyranny instead of listening to words from 
the past. Benjamin Franklin:  Those who would give up Essential Liberty, to purchase a little Temporary safety, 
deserve neither Liberty nor Safety .
 Who gets the blame? The U.S. Congress and the American people. Unscrupulous, power mad members of 
Congress from both parties have been stomping on the U.S. Constitution for decades. A disinterested and 
uninformed population have continued to vote the same destroyers back into office election after election with the 
help of election fraud committed by party hacks and all the sophisticated electronic methods of stealing our votes.
 Much of the blame can also be given to the government s indoctrination centers they call public schools for 
eliminating civics, teaching of our history, the sacrifices made to birth this republic, constitutional classes and 
inculcating a love for America and all we used to stand for. The Communist Party International has executed their 
plan to infiltrate America s schools with precision over the decades. Just look at America s colleges and 
universities. Leftist hell holes breeding young Americans into perfect little communists. Oh, they start out embracing 
socialism, but after years of drowning in propaganda, what we have are tens and tens of millions of adult age 
Americans who don t have a clue about the founding of this republic (the majority believe we re a democracy), don t 
care and want only for mother government to take care of their every need while they pursue the dead American 
dream.

Obama Administration Takes First Step in Probe on Who Leaked Info About Phone, Email Tracking[96]
 The Obama administration has taken a first step toward opening a criminal investigation into the purported leaking 
of classified documents related to the federal government tracking Americans  phone calls and emails, a source 
familiar with the high-level discussions told Fox News on Saturday.
 The source said James Clapper, the director of U.S. national intelligence, had filed a  criminal report with the 
Justice Department and the FBI, which begins the process.
  The Department reviews any referrals it receives from the intelligence community consistent with established 
procedures for determining whether investigation is warranted,  a DOJ source told Fox News late Saturday.

Police Say Men Came From Virginia to Loot in Tornado-Ravaged Moore[98]
 MOORE   Arrested with a truck full of copper wire, scrap metal and other items from homes destroyed by the May 
20 tornado in Moore, three men told police they came hundreds of miles   all the way from Virginia   for the sole 
purpose of looting in the disaster area.
 Another resident reported that a $50,000 watch was stolen from his home in Moore.
 Nearly three weeks since a monster tornado tore through the city, killing more than 20 and wiping entire homes 
from existence, Moore police continue to investigate looting in the massive disaster area.
 Steven Corky Daniels, of Harrisonburg, Va., was arrested Sunday when a Moore police officer spotted him walking 
near Broadway and SW 8 carrying a  large piece of utility wire in his hand. 
 Daniels, 36, claimed to be the owner of recycling company in his home state. He apparently admitted to police why 
he was in Moore.
  (Daniels) advised he drove from Virginia to Moore   with two other subjects for the purpose of removing steel and 
copper utility wire from the disaster area,  an affidavit filed in Cleveland County District Court shows.
 Daniels was charged with disturbing a disaster area, a misdemeanor, on Monday. He has since posted bail.
 Steve Costello, 44, and Justin Wagner, 25, were arrested, along with Daniels. And like Daniels, police say both 
men admitted why they had driven to Oklahoma when questioned.

Rand Paul: Orwell s 1984 Has Arrived[100]
 The FBI wants back doors to all communications equipment and software. The NSA is grabbing trillions of phone 
records of American citizens. And reporters  research apparently is a subject of interest at the Department of 
Justice. All of this and more has triggered a surge of renewed interest in a recent video by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., 
in which he declares that  1984,  the George Orwell novel about ultimate government disinformation, manipulation 
and control   is here.  Dystopian novels were just that, bad utopias,  he said,  but not practically possible. One could 
always sigh in relief that such surveillance, such invasion of privacy, was not technologically possible. Until now. 
Now we have the technology. Drones that measure less than an inch, weigh less than an ounce and hover 
noiselessly outside your bedroom window are not a dystopian future but today s reality,  he said.

Ross Douthat: Chilling Effect Only at the Margins[104]
 by Diana West
 New York Times columnist Ross Douthat today predicts that Americans will react mainly with complacency over 
government Internet and telephone surveillance. He goes on to assure us  America isn t about to turn into East 
Germany with Facebook pages. 
 For us, the age of surveillance is more likely to drift toward what Alexis de Toqueville described as  soft despotism  
or what the Forbes columnist James Poulos has dubbed  the pink police state. 
He continues:
 Our government will enjoy extraordinary, potentially tyrannical powers, but most citizens will be monitored without 
feeling persecuted or coerced.
What police state officer from East Germany eastward could express it better?
 So instead of a climate of pervasive fear, there will be a chilling effect at the margins of political discourse, mostly 
affecting groups and opinions considered disreputable already.
As a member of a  group  or two with an  opinion  or two  considered disreputable already,  I feel pin-prick shivers 
over such complacency. The casual use of the word  disreputable,  the surrender of the  margins of political 
discourse  are themselves alarming.
 Here s an example of how that chilling effect already works. The US government, acting in accord with known 
Muslim Brotherhood front groups, has officially scrubbed the facts of jihad from the training and analysis of all 
government security agencies and the military (just as, I report in American Betrayal, the US government scrubbed 
the facts of Communism during WWII censorship); therefore, those who teach it and even have a negative opinion 
of it are already  disreputable.  What does the pink police state do next?
 Probably nothing   nothing aside from keeping the temperature low on those  margins of political discourse.  Such 
margins are now, according to Douthat, effectively no-go-zones for the First Amendment.

The NSA s  Boundless Informant  Collects 3 Billion Intelligence Pieces From Networks in One Month[109]
 There s one reason why the administration, James Clapper and the NSA should just keep their mouths shut as the 
PRISM-gate fallout escalates: with every incremental attempt to refute some previously unknown facet of the US 
Big Brother state, a new piece of previously unleaked information from the same intelligence organization now 
scrambling for damage control, emerges and exposes the brand new narrative as yet another lie, forcing even more 
lies, more retribution against sources, more journalist persecution and so on.
 The latest piece of news once again comes from the Guardian s Glenn Greenwald who this time exposes the NSA 
s datamining tool  Boundless Informant  which according to leaked documents collected 97 billion pieces of 
intelligence from computer networks worldwide in March 2013 alone, and  3 billion pieces of intelligence from US 
computer networks over a 30-day period. 
 This is summarized in the chart below which shows that only the middle east has more active NSA-espionage than 
the US. Also, Obama may not want to show Xi the activity heatmap for China, or else the whole  China is hacking

The Secrets of Roman Concrete[111]
 An international team of researchers has examined Roman concrete to learn why it has proven to be so durable. A 
sample of Roman concrete taken from the ancient port of Baiae in Pozzuloi Bay revealed that by mixing lime and 
volcanic ash for underwater structures, the Romans used the seawater to trigger a chemical reaction that hydrated 
the lime and mixed with the ash to form a glue that is stronger than what holds modern concrete together. Plus, the 
ingredients of Roman concrete can be formed at lower temperatures, using less fuel and releasing less carbon into 
the atmosphere.

The Sinister Spiritual Scandal Beneath All the Obama Political Scandals[113]
 Taking his own words at face value, Obama tells us that at Wright s church, he learned he could continue to walk in 
his sins, and still claim to be a  committed Christian.  Obama learned from Wright how to be a Marxist while hiding 
behind a facade of Christianity. But try as he might, Obama cannot portray himself as a  committed Christian  
without the counterfeit nature of those assertions oozing darkly through his empty religious rhetoric, demonstrating 
for the umpteenth time that  The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain  (I Corinthians 3:20).
 On September 28, 2010, at a campaign barbecue in Albuquerque, Obama said he became a Christian because the  
precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead, being my brothers  and 
sisters  keeper . . .  Jesus never expressed any such precept. In all of Scripture, only the liar and murderer, Cain, 
used the term  brother s keeper.  Never are we urged by the inspired Word of our Creator to be our  brother s 
keeper.  The word keeper in the Hebrew has an imprisoning connotation:  to be hedged about as with thorns.  The 
apostle Paul teaches,  For freedom Christ frees us  (Galations 5:1).
 Attempting to force the words of Cain into the mouth of Christ is more than a gross misunderstanding of Scripture; 
it is an abject, intentional distortion of it.

 She explains that staff must pay for their own uniforms, that they are not paid when required to be on call outside of 
scheduled work hours, and if they leave the firm before 15 months have expired they must pay  200.
 These working conditions violate some national legislation as well as European regulations, the paper notes.

France to Ban Far-Right Group After Student Death[119]
 French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault on Saturday ordered the  dissolution  of a far-right group allegedly linked 
to the death of a left-wing student in a Paris street brawl.
 He asked his interior minister to take steps  immediately  to ban the Revolutionary Nationalist Youth (JNR), his 
office said in a statement.
 The JNR is the militant wing of a far-right group called the Third Way.
 Its leader Serge Ayoub, who has been questioned by police but is not a suspect, on Saturday again denied the 
group had anything to do with the death of 18-year-old Clement Meric.
 Meric, a student at the prestigious Sciences-Po university, died after a clash in a busy Paris shopping area on 
Wednesday between skinheads and left-wing activists.
 Five people detained over the death went before a judge on Saturday and Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said 
the main suspect, named Esteban, was being investigated on suspicion of murder.
 The five suspects are aged between 19 and 32 and include one woman.
 Interior Minister Manuel Valls on Friday vowed to crack down on far-right groups.
 Meric s death on Thursday, the day after the incident, brought condemnation from across the political spectrum 
and prompted thousands of people to go out onto the streets in Paris and other major cities in protest.
 As well as the five suspects held, three more were picked up and later released on Friday.

French Olympic Judo Champion Riner Alleges Racism at Paris  Posh Buddha Bar; Waitress Fired[121]
 PARIS   The Buddha Bar has fired a waitress for improper behavior toward Olympic champion judoka Teddy Riner, 
who lashed out about alleged racism at the upscale Paris bar-restaurant.
Gates of Vienna News Feed 6/9/2013
 On Facebook, the 24-year-old London Games gold medalist described how he had momentarily left his table one 
evening to get a better look at a Brazilian-themed show, and a waitress asked for his credit card and grabbed his 
arm  firmly. 
 Riner suggested other patrons didn t receive similar treatment because they were white, writing:  Never go to 
Buddha-bar if you re BLACK!!!! 
 Buddha Bar spokesman Laurent Guyot denied any racist motive. He said Sunday the waitress didn t recognize 
Riner and was fired for having grabbed his arm inappropriately. Guyot said staffers ask for credit cards in such 
cases because some customers leave without paying.

Italy: Exor Sells 15% Sgs Stake for 2 Bn Euros to Belgium s Gbl[123]
 Agnelli family holding cedes Swiss certification company stake
 (ANSA)   Turin, June 3   Exor S.p.A., the holding company for the vast assets of the Agnelli family   the dynasty 
behind Fiat automobiles   announced on Monday it is ceding its entire 15% stake in the Swiss inspection and 
certification company SGS S.A. to the Belgian holding Groupe Bruxelles Lambert S.A. (GBL) for two billion euros.
 Exor will see a consolidated capital gain of about 1.5 billion euros from the deal.
 Exor began investing in SGS in 2000 and has had a consistent presence on its board of directors over the last 13 
years.
 Over that time, SGS turnover has grown from 2.4 billion to 5.6 billion Swiss francs, and its operating margin has 
risen from 154 million to 941 million Swiss francs.
 SGS capitalization has roughly quadrupled in that time and consolidated its position as global leader in the 
inspection and certification sector.
 Exor said it intended to use the proceeds for further investment, and said it was proud to have supported the 
company over the years, as it consolidated its competitive positioning and built value for its shareholders.
 The late Umberto Agnelli   who managed the Agnelli family s investment portfolio at Exor s predecessor holding 
company IFIL   in 2000 sounded out Sergio Marchionne to spearhead a turnaround at SGS S.A., which had just 
suffered a heavy loss of Swiss government contracts, according to the book  Mondo Agnelli: Fiat, Chrysler, and the 
Power of a Dynasty  by Jennifer Clark. Marchionne joined SGS as a board member in 2001 and as CEO in 2002, 
Clark wrote, and then recruited from SGS to head Fiat in 2004.
 Marchionne is currently SGS chairman and will remain in his post after the change in stakeholders of reference, 
SGS announced.
 The transaction is expected to be finalized by June 10. Exor is selling 1,173,400 shares in SGS for 2,128 Swiss 
Francs per share to the company Serena, entirely owned by GBL.
 GBL is a Belgian industrial holding company and has been listed in Brussels since 1956. It is one of Belgium s ten 
largest companies and is part of the BEL20 index.

Italy: More Assets Seized From Indicted Ex-Public Works Chief[125]
 Balducci on trial in September with Anemone
 (ANSA)   Rome, June 7   Italian police on Friday seized 13 million euros in assets from Angelo Balducci, the former 
head of Italy s public-works board who is at the centre of a huge contract-rigging case.
 Balducci was indicted with several others last month in connection with alleged corruption linked to major events 
including the original Sardinian venue for the 2008 Group of Eight summit, which was eventually moved to quake-
ravaged L Aquila in Abruzzo.
 It was the second asset seizure for Balducci after one earlier this year which amounted to 12 million euros.
 In both, homes, cars, motorcycles, bank accounts and investments belonging to Balducci and his family were 
seized.

 (ANSA)   Cagliari, June 7   Finance police have arrested 16 people following an investigation into fake organic

 False certificates attesting to the quality of the products, as well as fake invoices, were issued on products aimed 
for Italian and European markets, authorities said.
 The fraud allowed the company to charge the higher prices that certified organic products can fetch.
 The investigation stretched down the entire peninsula, from Emilia Romagna and the Veneto regions to Lazio, 
Marche and Puglia as well as on Sardinia.
 Investigators say they have a total of 24 suspects facing charges ranging from tax evasion to fraud.
 Those arrested include company owner Benito Cremonini, 77, of Imola and company director Michele Grossi, 38, 
of Fossombrone.
 Three people who were government-accredited inspectors face charges of corruption.

Italy: Minetti Denies Pimping, Says  Really Loved  Berlusconi[133]
 Ex-Lombardy councillor faces 7-year sentence for procurement
 (ANSA)   Milan, June 7   Silvio Berlusconi s former dental hygienist and ex-Lombardy regional councillor Nicole 
Minetti on Friday denied supplying girls for the ex-premier s alleged sex parties.
 Minetti, on trial with two others for allegedly procuring young women including an alleged underage prostitute 
known as Ruby, said she had never taken them to the centre-right leader s mansion outside Milan.
 She also told the court she had felt  true love  for Berlusconi.
 Minetti was reportedly at one stage involved with the politician-turned media magnate, who is separately on trial for 
allegedly paying Ruby for sex and using his position as premier to cover up their relationship.
 Berlusconi, who faces a possible six-year sentence in that trial, has had a steady girlfriend, Francesca Pascale, 
since he re-entered the political fray to take his conservative alliance within a whisker of winning the February 
general election. On trial with Minetti in the pimping trial are former Berlusconi TV anchor Emilio Fede and bankrupt 
talent scout Lele Mora.
 The prosecution has requested a seven-year jail term for the three.
 Minetti also told the court that when Berlusconi phoned from Paris to ask her to take Ruby home after telling police 
she was former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak s niece, she was  only doing it for the girl s benefit .
 The ex-Lombardy councillor, who took Ruby away with a Brazilian prostitute, said she had been the target of an  
unprecedented hate campaign .
 Minetti also denied  running  a stable of more than 30 young women who attended Berlusconi s so-called  bunga 
bunga  parties and allegedly had sex with him.
 Berlusconi and Ruby deny having sex and say a 4.5-million-euro gift was to help her set up a beauty salon.
 The ex-premier has said he felt sorry for the then-17-year-old Ruby, a Moroccan-born nightclub dancer whose real 
name is Karima El Mahroug, after she told him she had fled an allegedly abusive Islam-enforcing father and also 
suffered in youth shelters.

Licence Needed for All Firearms in Belgium[141]
 The Belgian Justice Minister Annemie Turtelboom (Flemish liberal) has abolished a list of firearms for which no 
licence was required. As a result a licence will be needed for the 680 different types of firearm that featured on the 
list. The list included firearms of historic value or of a decorative or folkloristic nature.
 Annemie Turtelboom:  We were the only country in the continent of Europe where you could still buy a firearm 
without the need for a licence. This has led to a number of tragic incidents in the past   just think of the events in 
Liège eighteen months ago. This is why, just like our neighbouring countries, we have abolished the list of freely 
available firearms . 
 Minister Turtelboom was keen to add that the new rules won t apply to folkloristic organisations staging pageants 
or reconstructions of historic events. The police do have to be notified about arms used in such events. People in 
possession of an arm currently on the list have a year in which to get a licence.
 In 2011 a man went on the rampage in the centre of Liège firing indiscriminately at bystanders. Five people were 
killed. Over a hundred were injured.

Member of EU Parliament Calls European Union a Nazi Plan[145]
 Gerard Batten, a member of the European Parliament for London for the United Kingdom Independence Party,

  In 1942,  Mr. Batten told Alex Jones,  the German central bank under Doctor Walther Funk along with leading 
industrialists said how are we going to run the economies of Europe after we have won the war.  They proposed the  
European Economic Community, that s what they called it, and they had a common agricultural policy  and policies 
covering other aspects of trade and cultural affairs.
 Batten said it is more than likely many of the Nazi economic architects responsible for drafting up plans for a 
common union found their way into the bureaucracy after the supranational institution began under the auspices of 
the European Economic Community in the early 1950s, at the same time the Bilderberg Group was established and 
began to hold annual meetings. The Maastricht Treaty officially established the current European Union in 1993.

Crime and Death Rates Rising in Gaza Strip (So They Say)[152]
 Palestinians, of course, blame it on Israel.
 Just have a look at some of the reasons they are dying in Gaza family disputes, misuse of weapons and tunnel 
collapses and it is all Israel s fault!
 From Al-Monitor:
 Mustafa Ibrahim, a researcher for the Independent Commission for Citizens  Rights, told Al-Monitor that eight 
citizens were killed in the Gaza Strip in May. The deaths were the result of family disputes, robberies, tunnel 
collapses and suicides.
 He pointed out that the commission observed a significant increase in the rate of violence in the West Bank and 
Gaza from the beginning of the year until April compared to the same period last year.
 He added that about 61 people were killed in Gaza and the West Bank because of family disputes, misuse of 
weapons, tunnel collapses on the border with Egypt, apartment building collapses and the lack of safety measures 
in industrial workshops and other places.
 Wait for it! You knew it would be in the article somewhere!
 Ibrahim said that the crime rate is related to the living conditions, particularly in Gaza. He said that the high 
unemployment rate, the Israeli blockade and the continual power outages are frustrating the people.

Putin Volunteers Russian Soldiers for Golan Heights[158]
 Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday offered Russian replacements for the peacekeeping force Austria wants to 
withdraw from the Golan Heights.
 Austria said it was concerned about the safety of its 370 soldiers because the conflict in Syria has spread to a 
strategic border crossing. Security conditions have deteriorated in the area around the U.N. Golan Heights 
headquarters since the Quneitra crossing became the site of a clash between Syrian and rebel forces, CNN 
reported Friday.
 Austria s announcement it will remove its soldiers slashes the number of U.N. troops in the Golan Heights by one-
third.
 Filipino and Indian peacekeepers will remain and the United Nations may bring in troops from other nations, U.N. 
spokeswoman Josephine Guerrero said.
 Putin told a meeting of top Russian military officers in Moscow the United Nations has asked Russia to make a 
larger contribution to its peacekeeping efforts and he is ready and willing to replace the Austrians.
  Naturally, that will happen only if the regional powers show interest in our proposal and if the U.N. secretary-
general asks us to do that,  Putin said.
 Syrian tanks crossed into a demilitarized zone Friday and two U.N. peacekeepers were wounded when a mortar 
shell fell near the U.N. base, Israeli officials said.
 Syrian rebels briefly took control Thursday of the Quneitra crossing, the only route between Israel and Syria, The 
New York Times reported.
 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday Western support for the Syrian opposition will only fuel 
violence in the country.
  We are disturbed by statements coming from leaders of the so-called Free Syrian Army as well as from some U.S, 
representatives, to the effect that support for the armed opposition will continue in order to restore the military 
balance on the ground. That is a road to nowhere,  Lavrov said.

U.S. Backed   FSA Rebels Massacre an Entire Christian Village in Syria[164]

 Members of the Free Syrian Army reportedly attacked the Christian-dominated al-Duvair village in Reef on the 
outskirts of Homs on Monday, where they massacred its citizens, including women and children, before the Syrian

Islamic extremist groups have been at the front of the rebel movement since day one of the Syrian war that began

About 48 Percent of Children in India Are Stunted   UNICEF[168]
 (Reuters)   Some 165 million children worldwide are stunted by malnutrition as babies and face a future of ill health, 
poor education, low earnings and poverty, the head of the United Nations children s fund said on Friday.
 Anthony Lake, executive director of UNICEF, told Reuters the problem of malnutrition is vastly under-appreciated, 
largely because poor nutrition is often mistaken for a lack of food.
 In reality, he said, malnutrition and its irreversible health consequences also affect relatively well-off countries, such 
as India where there is plenty of food, but access to it is unequal and nutritional content can be low.
  Undernutrition, and especially stunting, is one of the least recognised crises for children in the world,  Lake said.  It 
s a horrible thing. These children are condemned. 
 Stunting is the consequence of undernutrition in the first 1,000 or so days of a baby s life, including during 
gestation.
 Stunted children learn less in school and are more likely themselves to live in poverty and go on to have children 
also stunted by poor nutrition. These in turn increase poverty in affected countries and regions, and drive greater 
gaps between the rich and the poor, Lake said.
Gates of Vienna News Feed 6/9/2013
  The numbers are phenomenal. In India, for example, about 48 percent of children are stunted, and in Yemen it s 
almost 60 percent. Just think of the drag on development,  Lake said.
  And the key point is that it is absolutely irreversible. You can feed up an underweight child, but with a stunted 
child, because of the effects on the brain, it has a permanently reduced cognitive capacity by the age of around two 
years old.

China s Alzheimer s Time Bomb Revealed[174]
 In 2010, China had more people living with Alzheimer s disease than any other country in the world   and twice as 
many cases of Alzheimer s and other kinds of dementia as the World Health Organization thought.
 Cases of all kinds of age-related dementia in the country rose from 3.7 million in 1990 to 9.2 million in 2010. This is 
the finding of the first comprehensive analysis of Chinese epidemiological research, made possible by the recent 
digitisation of Chinese-language research papers. Previous estimates, based on English-language papers, seem to 
have under-reported the number of cases by half.
  We are now only beginning to comprehend the enormous value in this  parallel universe  of information,  says Igor 
Rutan of the University of Edinburgh, UK, who was part of the team that carried out the research.
 The figures are bad news for a country where 90 per cent of the elderly must be cared for by their families   old 
people who still have family members living are not allowed to be admitted to a nursing home   even as widespread 
migration to cities has disrupted the traditional family structure.
 Population bulge
 The findings are a reflection of China s ageing population, and its policies.
 As countries modernise, death rates fall, and later on birth rates fall as more people take up birth control. Between 
the two events, though, there is a  bulge  of births, the source of the modern world s population explosion. 
Eventually birth and death rates roughly equalise, but the birth bulge remains as an age bulge in the population.

Key German Exports Eclipsed by China[178]
 Germany s dominance in key export sectors outside of Europe is waning as China takes over greater market 
share, a new study has found. It predicts Chinese exports to Europe could even soon rival German products.
 Chinese exports to Japan and the United States have taken over from Germany s, even in the traditionally 
Teutonic areas of engineering, chemicals and control systems. In these markets, Germany has retained dominance 
only in the automotive industry.
 The findings are part of a wide-ranging study on German-Chinese trade relations, carried out by Prognos on behalf 
of the Bertelsmann foundation.
 The study also revealed that Germany has failed to establish itself as a leading exporter in major emerging 
economies like Brazil and India. In both markets, China has either taken over from or is hot on the heels of 
Germany in all areas except for automobile manufacture.
 In India, China leads the way in engineering as well as the import of chemicals. Here Germany trails the United 
States, Argentina and South Korea.
 The study authors speculate that Germany s focus on establishing itself in China could have come at the expense 
of gaining a foothold in India and Brazil. However they also cite higher product prices as a possible explanation for 
the lower demand there.

Austria: People-Smuggling Ring Dismantled[182]
 A criminal organisation which has been smuggling people from Iran to Tirol, Austria, since 2011 used the catholic 
course of faith to claim asylum.
 The organisation is thought to have brought at least 60 Iran nationals to Austria against cash payments since 2011.
 The organisation is thought to have organised faith courses, carried out by the Church, to convert the asylum 
seekers to Catholicism. Indeed, Catholicism being forbidden and punished my death penalty in Iran and religious 
persecution being a valid motive for an asylum application, the Iranians could virtually not be kicked out the country.
 Between 30 and 40 people were baptised on Easter Sunday this year alone. In all the cases, asylum has been 
granted or the procedure has not yet been completed.
 Christoph Hundertpfund, the deputy director of the regional investigation office said it was an ingenious method 
and that through the courses, the newly arrived Iranians were able to make a credible impression as to their new

Leprosy Arrives in Ireland With Immigrant From South America[186]
 One more of the joys of multi-culturalism and mass migration!
 From Irish Central:
 The Irish health authority has confirmed the first case of leprosy in Ireland in living memory but has reassured the 
public that there is no cause for concern.
 The victim, who is understood to be a native of South America in his 30s is believed to have contracted the disease 
outside of Ireland and was thought to have suffered from the condition in the past. The disease was discovered at a 
County Meath clinic. The doctor who treated him stated he presented for a disease seen  more in the Middle Ages

Children s Network Launches Transsexual Superhero[188]
 Show For Younger Children Nothing says  child-appropriate material  quite like gender-bending underage 
superheroes. At least that s the theory over at the Hub, the network co-owned by Discovery and Hasbro, which is 
trotting out its latest SheZow, an animated superhero sporting a purple skirt and cape, pink gloves and white go-go 
boots. She is also a he. Yes, you heard that correctly.
 The program, which targets children aged two to eleven, follows the adventures of a 12-year-old boy named Guy 
who uses a magic ring to transform himself into a crime-fighting girl. When Guy says the magic words    You go girl!    
he becomes SheZow, wearing a purple skirt and cape, as well as pink gloves and white boots. The star of the 
cartoon debuting Saturday on the Hub kids  cable channel is co-owned by cable programming giant Discovery 
Communications and toy manufacturer Hasbro Inc

Sweden: Migration Board to be Given  LGBTQ  Training[190]
 Workers at the Swedish Migration Board are to undergo special training in the issues facing LGBTQ (Lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, trans- and queer) refugees, following a decision by the Swedish government.
 Refugees who clearly face oppression in their home countries due to their sexual orientation or identity have a right 
to asylum here in Sweden, according to Swedish and EU law, but there has been criticism that the migration 
authorities have not been consistent in their treatment of the refugees. Some refugees facing the same problems 
and from the same country have been allowed to stay, while others have been sent back to face repression at 
home.
 So now workers at the migration board will undergo training, with each department around the country having their 
own expert in the problems facing LGBTQ people, newspaper Dagens Nyheter reports.

BULLETIN
**Strong gains in share prices have boosted the value of companies both in Ireland and abroad since the low points 
of 2008 and 2009**
**While much public scrutiny has been focused on executive salaries, directors and chief executives of listed firms 
have been clocking up enormous gains in share appreciation and stock options**
**With the Iseq up more than 100 per cent since the bottom in March 2009, some Irish plc bosses are now sitting on 
shares worth tens of millions**
.....
International stock markets have climbed spectacularly from the depths of the financial crisis in 2008. Major trading 
floors have seen share prices rise substantially for a few years in a row. In Ireland, the collapse was more painful, 
and the climb back up has been a little less rapid. However, certain Irish companies have seen enormous share 
price gains.
With all the focus on executive salaries in recent years in the wake of the banking crisis, top executives in some 
Irish listed companies have quietly seen the value of their shareholdings rocket.
The group of companies that has done best is quite varied. Some of the bigger companies like CRH have seen a 
solid share price performance, having fallen less than others during the crash.
Others like Ryanair, Paddy Power and C&C have seen massive share price gains, boosting the coffers of their 
executive team in general, and chief executives in particular.
Stock take for Irish bosses
Last week, the FTSE 100 index, at around 6,053, was higher than it was in May 2008 before the financial crash. It 
was also dramatically higher than its 3,530 in March 2009, when many stock markets, including in Ireland, were at 
their lowest of recent years.
On Wall St, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at around 15,409, is a lot higher than it was in May 2008 when it hit 
12,479. It is also more than double its March 2009 figure of 6,626. Even since January of this year, the Dow is up 
over 17 per cent. The Nasdaq is up 169 per cent since the darker and more uncertain days of March 2009.
In Ireland, the Iseq index is up 104 per cent since March 2009. In money terms, shares in the Irish index have 
added around EUR 76 billion in value. Inevitably, this is reflected in the value of the stakes of their bigger 
shareholders and their top executives.
In some cases, chief executives are not long enough with the company to have accumulated massive 
shareholdings. For others, like Smurfit Kappa Group, chief executive Gary McGann is paid very highly in 
remuneration but holds fewer shares.
Here are some of the big gains that executives and investors have enjoyed at Irish listed companies.
.....
**Michael O'Leary of Ryanair: EUR 355 million**
The Ryanair chief executive has the most valuable shareholding of any executive in an Irish quoted company. His 
51 million shares in Ryanair are currently valued at around EUR 355 million.
Incredibly, the company's share price gain has been so dramatic, the value of his stake has increased by EUR 171 
million since the start of last year and by a staggering EUR 115 million in the last five months. O'Leary recently 
announced that he planned to stay in the job for another five years.
.........................
**Stan McCarthy of Kerry Group: EUR 10.8 million (includes shares and potential share options)**
Food company stocks have been among the most stellar performers in recent years. Kerry Group is a EUR 6 billion 
business and its chief executive, Stan McCarthy, has seen the value of his 84,841 shares rise to EUR 3.8 million. 
He has a further 165,000 conditional and vested share awards which are dependent on performance. They could 
be worth a further EUR 7 million.
Kerry Group was relatively late to introduce a share option scheme for executives and tended to reward its senior 
executives highly in remuneration terms.
However, a scheme was brought in several years ago.
The gain in the Kerry share price has been dramatic, climbing by 58 per cent since the start of last year. This has 
seen the 30 million shares held by the farmer-owned Kerry Co-op increase in value from EUR 848 million to EUR 
1.3 billion -- an increase of EUR 452 million -- in just 17 months
.........................
**Owen Killian of Aryzta: EUR 49 million (includes shares and potential share options)**
The chief executive of the global bakery business has seen the value of his shares in the company rise significantly. 
With its main listing in Zurich, Aryzta shares have climbed by 21 per cent since the start of last year. Between the 
awarding of performance-related shares, and his previous shareholding, Killian's 823,000 Aryzta shares are now 
worth around EUR 37.4 million.
Stock take for Irish bosses
At the start of 2012, his then 523,000 shares were worth EUR 19.6 million. He has additional share options 
currently in the black to the tune of around EUR 11.6 million.
.........................
**Stephen Glancey of C&C: EUR 25.7 million (includes shares and potential share options)**
The cider and beer company continues to go down smoothly with investors. Stephen Glancey took over as chief 
executive last year, from his previous role as chief operating officer. His 5.1 million shares are now worth EUR 23.4 
million. This is an increase of EUR 8.8 million since the start of last year. He also has additional share options 
currently worth around EUR 2.3 million.
His predecessor, John Dunsmore, who left last year, has 5.1 million shares, currently worth EUR 23.4 million.
.........................
**Patrick Kennedy of Paddy Power: EUR 22.5 million**
The betting group has seen its share price rise dramatically as it expands into online gambling and new territories 
such as Australia and Italy.
Among the really big winners from this are the co-founders of the company, David Power and John Corcoran. 
Power is still a non-executive director and his 3.85 million shares are now worth EUR 245 million. That is EUR 171 
million more than they were worth at the start of last year. Four years ago, they were worth EUR 46.5 million. 
Corcoran has 1.5 million shares, now worth EUR 96.7 million.
At the start of 2011, Patrick Kennedy, the chief executive who has driven much of the growth in recent years since 
joining from Greencore, had 264,921 shares, worth EUR 8.1 million.
As the share price has climbed to EUR 64.50, his 350,247 shares are now worth EUR 22.5 million. He also has 
around 320,000 outstanding share options that are performance-related and exercised at different prices.
.........................
**John Moloney of Glanbia: EUR 3.5 million**
Glanbia's steady share price rise has been very impressive. When Irish stocks were at their recession low in March 
2009, Glanbia shares were trading at EUR 2.15 per share. Currently trading at around EUR 10.74, they have risen 
fivefold in just four years. The stock is up 132 per cent since the beginning of 2012.
Moloney, who announced his intention to retire shortly, has 202,000 shares worth around EUR 2.1 million. Other 
performance-related share awards amount to around EUR 1.4 million. He sold 150,000 shares in January, making a 
profit of around EUR 800,000. He also has 200,000 shares that vested just last month. Moloney holds 3.4 million 'C' 
class shares in Glanbia Co-op.
.........................
**Gary McGann of Smurfit Kappa Group: EUR 4.8 million**
The Smurit Kappa paper and packaging group has seen its share price rise by 820 per cent since the low of March 
2009. Chief executive Gary McGann is one of Ireland's highest paid executives. His remuneration was EUR 2.4 
million in 2012 and EUR 2.5 million in 2011.
His 375,000 shares are worth EUR 4.8 million. He has a potential further 480,000 performance-related conditional, 
convertible and deferred shares. Tony Smurfit has one million shares in the group, currently worth around EUR 12.8 
million.
Stock take for Irish bosses
.........................
**Richie Boucher of Bank of Ireland: EUR 72,000**
Investors like billionaire Wilbur Ross will be very pleased at the share price gain at Bank of Ireland. Ross described 
his Bank of Ireland investment as one his best since the financial crisis began, with the shares up 80 per cent from 
his investment price.
Bank of Ireland shares are trading around 19 cent and some investors got in at around 9 cent.
But bank chief executive Richie Boucher wasn't one of them. Boucher has found himself in the spotlight over 
remuneration levels, but despite the sizeable share price gain, he is not in a position to really benefit from it.
He has just 380,000 shares in the bank, currently worth just EUR 72,000. None of his old share options are 
remotely close to being in the money given their very high exercise prices. So, a lot of progress at Bank of Ireland, 
but no mega pay-day for Boucher.

The Board of Ireland West Airport Knock today said that it has accepted the resignation of its Chairman Liam 
Scollan.
He leaves after eleven years with the Airport in various roles, including Managing Director from 2002 to 2009, and 
most recently Chairman of CADCO, the airport's operating company for the past 4 years.
During his time with the Airport it has grown to become an international airport with over 25 UK and European 
destinations. It has experienced significant passenger growth and in 2012 it had the busiest year in its history with 
over 685,000 passengers and major international airlines, including Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus Regional, Ryanair, 
Flybe and Lufthansa, now part of its customer base.
The Airport also completed an infrastructure transformation including the construction of the new departures 
terminal; airfield security fencing; and the installation of a modern Instrument Landing System that has resulted in a 
substantial reduction in weather related diversions. During his tenure as Chairman of the Airport, Mr Scollan worked 
tirelessly to position the Airport as a key strategic infrastructure asset for the region it serves, and to secure its 
future with Government as part of the national aviation landscape going forward. Commenting on the 
announcement, Mr Scollan said: "I believe the time is right to move on. I have given eleven years of leadership to 
the Airport and was very fortunate to oversee tremendous growth. I have always believed there is a time to move on 
in life and hand over to other capable people. I look forward to putting fresh energy and leadership into new 
ventures in the period ahead. I would like to thank the Board and management and staff for their support over the 
past eleven years and I wish to thank all of the airlines, the people of the region and the almost 700,000 passengers 
that make the airport such a success."

Banks provided the weight behind the move higher for European equities yesterday as better news on the Spanish 
labour market and stable bond yields helped soothe nerves.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,211.34 with the most weight being added by the 
banks.
Deutsche Bank  rose 2.3 per cent to EUR36.73 while Spain's Banco Santander added 1.5 per cent to EUR5.58, 
boosted by data that showed Spanish unemployment fell by nearly 100,000.
STMicroelectronics was the biggest gainer on the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index after guiding higher expectations for 
full-year growth.
Carlo Bozotti, chief executive of the Franco-Italian chipmaker, told Le Figaro he expected order growth of between 
5 and 10 per cent for the year, following growth of 5 per cent in the first quarter.
The shares rose 4.5 per cent to EUR7.47.
German chipmaker Infineon Technologies climbed 1.8 per cent to EUR6.58.
Nokia rose 2.5 per cent to EUR2.71 after China's Lenovo, the computer manufacturer, was reported to be in 
discussions with Japan's NEC to build smartphones.
Lenovo has been on the acquisition trail in recent years and rumours of interest in Nokia have hit European trading 
floors several times in the last year.
Airlines continued to perform well after Ireland's Ryanair reported passenger numbers were up 5 per cent cent in 
May and London-listed easyJet received a broker upgrade.
Deutsche Bank and Santander advance EUROPE
Ryanair , which also said its load factor rose from 81 per cent last May to 82 per cent, gained 2.5 per cent to 
EUR7.02.
Lufthansa added 2.3 per cent to EUR17.10.
Ahold fell 3 per cent to EUR12.19 after Dick Boer, chief executive of the Dutch retailer, said pressure on consumer 
spending in the US and Europe left the company "very cautious".
A picture of slumping sales in Europe's car industry continued to emerge after Fiat , the best performer last week 
on news of its forthcoming merger with US partner Chrysler, fell 1.7 per cent to EUR6.22 after Italian new car sales 
fell 8 per cent in May.

Irish budget carrier Ryanair has detailed the five-year delivery schedule for its new batch of 175 Boeing 737-800s, 
with the first 11 scheduled to arrive by the end of March 2015.
Its fleet at the beginning of the current 2013-2014 fiscal year stood at 305 of the type, which will drop to 290 when 
the 2014-2015 year opens, as leased jets are returned and the carrier disposes of older aircraft. The first 11 of the 
new order will then enter the fleet, while the carrier will respectively take 35, 50, 50 and 29 aircraft over the following 
four years.
Ryanair will also withdraw 105 other 737s, giving it a net fleet of 375 by the end of March 2019.
At this point, Ryanair says in a newly distributed shareholder document, it will have capacity to achieve annual 
passenger volumes of 100 million.
Ryanair says it intends to finance the 737 purchase through non Ex-Im means, including internally generated cash 
flows and debt financing from commercial banks and capital markets. "These forms of financing are generally 
accepted in the aviation industry and are currently widely available for companies who have the credit quality of 
Ryanair," it adds.
It gives the price of each aircraft as $81.3 million, but this excludes confidential discounts. Ryanair owns 246 of its 
aircraft and says it will dispose of 25-50 during the course of the order.

Europe's economies may be sluggish, with many mired in recession, but the recent glut of aircraft orders from the 
continent's low-cost carriers underlines the fact they are shrugging off the effects of the wider economic malaise.
Ryanair and Turkish carrier Pegasus Airlines have joined Norwegian in securing aircraft for the next stage of their 
growth, while EasyJet and Vueling are closing in on their own fleet renewal decisions.
Europe's top 10 low-cost operators recorded 6.5% growth in 2012 passenger numbers, carrying 250 million 
passengers with a combined fleet of 936 aircraft.
That growth would have been even higher if not for the restructuring at Air Berlin, which is evolving from a 
traditional low-fare model.
Europe's 10 leading network carriers flew about 320 million passengers during the same period, albeit on a different 
mix of route types.
Ryanair remains the biggest no-frills carrier in Europe, transporting just shy of 80 million passengers last year. And 
earlier this year, the Irish airline finally brought an end to a protracted period of sparring with Boeing over a new 
aircraft order when it committed to 175 end-of-line 737-800s.
The final aircraft from a previous 737 order arrived at the end of last year and the first of the new twinjets are not 
due to make an appearance until 2015. As a result, Ryanair will struggle to match its usual growth rate during the 
next 18 months.
It targets to carry 81.5 million passengers this year, only 2 million more passengers than last year - a small change 
for an airline that virtually doubled passenger numbers between 2006 and 2012.
Order glut signals low-cost resilience Flurry of large commitments for new narrowbodies shows the ambitions of 
Europe's budget carriers remain undimmed
About 100 of the newly-ordered aircraft will be replacements, meaning the carrier envisages its fleet growing from a 
little over 300 today to reach 375 by 2019, although this could rise to as high as 400, according to the airline's 
deputy chief executive Howard Millar.
Ryanair is also in discussions with Boeing on the possibility of acquiring the re-engined 737 Max. "We've set up a 
review team to look at the benefits of it," says Millar.
Millar notes a trade-off between the fuel-saving benefits touted for the Max and the airliner's "slightly heavier" 
weight versus the "Model T Ford" 737-800.
Norwegian set the current order wave in motion with its eye-catching commitment last year for at least 200 re-
engined narrowbodies: 100 Airbus A320neos and 100 737 Maxs with options for 150 more. Given that it operates 
74 737s today, this is some rate of expansion.
Although it has an excess of 260 single-aisles on order, Norwegian's fleet growth will be tempered - as is the case 
with other low-cost carriers - by its strategy of replacing aircraft after seven years.
However, the reality is that the airline's orderbook and expansion plan is set to pitch it on a collision course with 
Europe's other low-cost carriers and the short-haul businesses of the region's legacy carriers.
"We'll definitely have more European bases," says chief executive Bjørn Kjos, and these could be located anywhere 
across the region. Its ambitions outside of its Nordic heartland have been illustrated by a clutch of new routes 
linking Germany and the UK with Spain.
Fast-growing Turkish carrier Pegasus Airlines has also put its fleet planning in motion. The airline operates 36 737s, 
but has a further 80 aircraft on order, which includes 75 A320neo family jets with 25 options.
EasyJet, however, has yet to reach a decision on the renewal of its fleet. The airline's fleet plan has been caught up 
in the long-running shareholder row, in which founder Stelios Haji--Ioannou has consistently criticised the pace of its 
future growth. The low-cost carrier says that it is in the "final stages" of evaluating a new short-haul engine 
technology.
If it finds that an order is in the interests of shareholders, it says, it will put forward a proposal for new deliveries 
after 2017 and a bridging strategy for 2015-2017.
It has been talking to Boeing, Bombardier and Airbus as well as engine manufacturers Pratt & Whitney and CFM 
International.
Fast-growing, Barcelona-based carrier Vueling is also in the market for new narrowbodies. The carrier, which 
mainly operates A320s, has expanded quickly since the demise of rival Spanair and now operates a fleet of 63 
aircraft. It has been studying Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier types for an order that would cover both fleet renewal 
and expansion.
The other major European budget carrier, Wizz Air, which operates a 40-strong, all-A320 fleet, has a further 71 
aircraft still on order.

Europe's economies may be sluggish, with many mired in recession, but the recent glut of aircraft orders from the 
continent's low-cost carriers underlines that they are shrugging off the effects of the wider economic malaise.
Ryanair and Turkish carrier Pegasus Airlines have joined Norwegian in securing aircraft for the next stage of their 
growth, while EasyJet and Vueling are closing in on their own fleet renewal decisions.
Europe's top 10 low-cost operators recorded 6.5% growth in 2012 passenger numbers, carrying 250 million 
passengers with a combined fleet of 936 aircraft.
That growth would have been even higher if not for the restructuring at Air Berlin, which is evolving from a 
traditional low-fare model.
Europe's 10 leading network carriers flew around 320 million passengers over the same period, albeit on a different 
mix of route types.
Ryanair remains the biggest no-frills carrier in Europe, transporting just shy of 80 million passengers last year. And 
earlier this year, the Irish airline finally brought an end to a protracted period of sparring with Boeing over a new 
aircraft order when it committed to 175 end-of-line Boeing 737-800s.
The final aircraft from a previous 737 order arrived at the end of last year and the first of the new twinjets are not 
due to make an appearance until 2015. As a result, Ryanair will struggle to match its usual growth rate over the 
next 18 months.
It targets to carry 81.5 million passengers this year, only 2 million more passengers than last year - a small change 
for an airline that virtually doubled passenger numbers between 2006 and 2012.
Around 100 of the newly-ordered aircraft will be replacements, meaning the carrier envisages its fleet growing from 
a little over 300 today to reach 375 by 2019, although this could rise to as high as 400, according to the airline's 
deputy chief executive Howard Millar.
Ryanair is also in discussions with Boeing on the possibility of acquiring the re-engined 737 Max. "We've set up a 
review team to look at the benefits of it," says Millar.
Millar notes a trade-off between the fuel-saving benefits touted for the Max and the airliner's "slightly heavier" 
weight versus the "Model T Ford" 737-800.

Regulators rule on Aer Lingus stake
Regulators rule on Aer Lingus stake

UK regulators have provisionally concluded that Ryanair must cut its stake in Aer Lingus to avoid adverse effects on 
competition.
The Competition Commission says Ryanair's shareholding gives it the ability to "influence" the Irish flag carrier's 
commercial policies and strategy.
It is proposing various potential remedies, including the sale of "all or part" of Ryanair's 29.8% stake.
Full sale would probably be an "effective" measure, the regulator says, but it is seeking views as to whether a 
partial sale - accompanied by other behavioural changes, depending on the size of the disposal - would be equally 
acceptable.
The Competition Commission is inviting comments before publishing its final report on 11 July.
Aer Lingus says it "welcomes" the decision, while Ryanair, predictably, has attacked the regulator's ruling, 
describing the inquiry as "bogus and baseless".
Ryanair says it will appeal to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal and, if necessary, the courts.

Ruling may put pressure on Ryanair to sell off its stake in Aer Lingus

Britain's Competition Commission is expected to publish the outcome of its investigation into the effect on 
competition of Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus by July 11.
The long-running probe, which resumed on March 1, is investigating whether Ryanair's near-30 per cent stake in 
Aer Lingus means there has been a "relevant merger event". A relevant merger event takes place when enterprises 
cease to be distinct, ie they are brought under common control or ownership.
In a provisional finding last week, the commission found the purchase had resulted in a relevant merger event and 
had diminished competition.
The questions to ask in determining "control" are whether one enterprise may acquire:
*the ability materially to influence the policy of the target;
**de facto*control, ie the ability to control the target's policy; or
**de jure*control, ie a controlling interest in the target.
If the Competition Commission decides that a relevant merger event has occurred and affected competition in the 
airline industry, it can order Ryanair to sell its stake.
The commission had postponed its investigation pending a separate investigation by the EU Commission into 
Ryanair's proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus. The EU Commission decided in February to prohibit the proposed 
bid.
In October 2010, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) began a merger investigation into Ryanair's acquisition of a 29.82 
per cent shareholding of Aer Lingus in 2006. Ryanair tried to acquire Aer Lingus in 2007 but was prevented by the 
Ruling may put pressure on Ryanair to sell off its stake in Aer Lingus
EU Commission on competition grounds. However, the commission did not order Ryanair to divest itself of its 
minority stake.
Ryanair appealed the decision to prevent the acquisition; Aer Lingus appealed the decision not to force the sale of 
the Ryanair stake.
The EU General Court in Luxembourg in 2010 upheld both decisions. It confirmed that the EC Commission did not 
have the power to require Ryanair to divest itself of its shareholding in Aer Lingus, as the planned takeover had 
been prohibited and Ryanair held only a non-controlling minority shareholding in Aer Lingus. The court also upheld 
the commission's decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition.
The commission is currently considering a revised EU merger Regulation to allow it to order the sale of non-
controlling minority shareholdings.
After the court's decision, the OFT announced it would investigate Ryanair's acquisition of its minority stake in Aer 
Lingus. Ryanair tried unsuccessfully to prevent the investigation on the basis that the OFT was out of time.
In its investigation, the OFT said:
*Ryanair could weaken Aer Lingus as a competitor through its voting power at shareholder meetings and affect Aer 
Lingus's ability to benefit from investment by other airlines; and
*Ryanair's incentive to compete with Aer Lingus on price would be reduced as any passengers lost by Ryanair due 
to higher fares would use Aer Lingus, and the lost value would be recouped through its stake in Aer Lingus
The OFT last June referred the matter to Britain's Competition Commission for a detailed merger investigation. 
However, before the investigation could get off the ground, Ryanair announced that it intended to offer EUR 694 
million for Aer Lingus. This led to an investigation by the EU Commission, and the Competition Commission 
investigation was suspended.
In its third attempt to acquire its smaller rival (the first in 2007 was refused by the commission, and the second in 
2009 was withdrawn), Ryanair offered a number of remedies to try and alleviate the commission's competition 
concerns. The final offer, described by Ryanair as "unprecedented and revolutionary", included commitments by 
rival airlines to operate some of the routes on which Ryanair and Aer Lingus had no rivals.
However, the commission was unconvinced by the package and questioned whether Flybe would have the 
experience or resources to compete with Ryanair, or whether IAG/British Airways could offer a commitment to 
maintain operations on the routes.
Ultimately, the commission said the merger would have led to reduced choice and increased fares. EU Competition 
Commissioner Joaquín Almunia noted that "remedying problems of such magnitude would have required a 
countervailing force capable of being a strong and viable competitor to Ryanair -- precisely the kind of competitor 
that Aer Lingus is today".
On February 27, the EU Commission formally announced its decision to prohibit the proposed transaction. Ryanair 
has said it will appeal the decision.
Shortly after the EC Commission decision, Britain's Competition Commission announced that it would resume its 
investigation into the 2006 acquisition.
On May 30, the Competition Commission provisionally found the acquisition by Ryanair in 2006 had not only 
resulted in a relevant merger situation, but it had had a lessening effect on competition in the British markets.
It provisionally found that Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus gives it the ability to exercise material influence over 
Aer Lingus's commercial policy and strategy and that this has affected Aer Lingus's overall effectiveness as a 
competitor.
Ruling may put pressure on Ryanair to sell off its stake in Aer Lingus
The Competition Commission has called for submissions from all interested parties on these provisional findings 
prior to it finalising its report, which is expected to be published by July 11.

LK Shields. Marco authored the book Merger Control, published earlier this month by Thomson Reuters trading as 
Round Hall Press. It is the first competition law book focused exclusively on merger control in Ireland*

Following last week's decision by Britain's Competition Commission involving Aer Lingus and Ryanair, Aer Lingus 
has moved closer towards acquisition by a foreign airline, according to one aviation analyst.
"Consolidation in the airline industry is inevitable and is happening everywhere else in the world," said Investec 
aviation analyst Gerard Moore. "Why should Ireland be the exception? Progress has been made on the two major 
obstacles -- Ryanair's shareholding in the airline and the pension problem. Resolving both will make it easier for Aer 
Lingus to be acquired by another airline. "
Britain's Competition Commission last week "provisionally decided" that Ryanair's 29.8 per cent stake could reduce 
competition on routes between Britain and Ireland and that Ryanair may have to reduce its shareholding in Aer 
Lingus.
The commission said that Ryanair's shareholding obstructs Aer Lingus's ability to merge or combine with another 
airline to build scale and achieve synergies to remain competitive. Ryanair responded by saying that it would appeal 
the "bizarre and manifestly wrong" ruling.
"The commission could get Ryanair to sell down its stake altogether, or at least below 10 per cent as in previous 
cases," said Moore. "If that does happen it will make it easier for another airline to acquire Aer Lingus."
A resolution to the airline's pension difficulties also appeared to move a step closer last week after the Labour Court 
issued recommendations.
The airline, headed by Christoph Mueller, said on Friday that if agreements and approvals can be reached it would 
implement the deal.
This would include a EUR 110 million contribution to a new defined contribution pension plan for existing 
employees, which would mark a significant step away from its previously held position that it was not liable to pay 
into such a fund.
Aviation: Foreign firm might make an Aer Lingus play
"If that issue is not resolved it would be extremely off putting for a foreign airline to come in if it had to deal with Irish 
pension law and negotiate with trade unions. The next step is to get agreement from the trustees, the trade unions 
and shareholders.
" If the resolution is put in place it puts a cap on the liability and makes it a lot easier for an outside company to 
judge the overall value of the company."
As a shareholder Ryanair could vote against the Labour Court recommendation but Moore said that the 
government's shareholding would act as a counterweight.
"There is a good chance the deal will be approved. In recent weeks the stock price has done very well, probably in 
anticipation of a deal. Nobody expected Aer Lingus to get away scot free and the final contribution is probably within 
expectations," said Moore.
Even if barriers to a sale of Aer Lingus are removed, any such deal would not necessarily happen quickly, said 
Moore.
He views International Airlines Group (IAG) the holding company of British Airways and Iberia -- led by former Aer 
Lingus boss Willie Walsh -- as the most likely party to ultimately have an interest in the airline. Nevertheless, IAG 
has said that acquisitions are not a priority for it at the moment, said Moore.
"That could change over time. There is a natural fit between the two airlines, not least because they are British and 
Irish companies. There are more natural synergies between them then there would be say with a German 
company."

Backroom: Whip ensures Fine Gael ship stays steady on abortion issue
Backroom: Whip ensures Fine Gael ship stays steady on abortion issue

The Fine Gael parliamentary party met last Wednesday evening and an uneasy internal ceasefire seems to have 
broken out on the abortion issue. Following some turbulent recent meetings, including one six-hour marathon, 
deputies, senators and ministers are now warily eyeing each other up and trying to guess colleagues' intentions.
There is no doubt that a significant number in the party have serious concerns about James Reilly's intentions. 
They worry about his commitment to Fine Gael's ethos and core values and that as something of a political 
carpetbagger Reilly has no feel for its Christian Democratic values.
Worrying about Reilly is a constant for parliamentary party members, though. Since the government was formed, 
rarely has a month gone by without some new calamity in the health services. Privately, his colleagues grumble 
about perceived clumsiness about media handling, and an inability to get on top of the issues. Communicating via 
tetchy emails with a colleague (Róisín Shortall) in an office just a few doors away was seen as gratuitously 
confrontational.
If the party is worried about Reilly, the opposite is the case with its chair of the Oireachtas Health Committee, Jerry 
Buttimer. He has shown a safe pair of hands chairing two rounds of hearings involving all those with an interest in 
the abortion issue.
Although not close to Reilly, Buttimer has provided the minister with a more than capable mudguard, for which he 
will surely be rewarded with a promotion in due course. Buttimer, an affable ex-seminarian, is popular among his 
colleagues and has played no small role in turning down the temperature in the party and quietly pulling a few 
waverers on to the government side.
The number of anti-abortion hardliners in Fine Gael has been shrinking steadily in recent weeks and there has been 
a noticeable media silence from some who were very keen to make their views known loudly not so long ago. While 
holding strong personal views and convictions on the subject, several are wondering if the issue is worth 
jeopardising a political career over. Many of these agonisers fought very hard to get into the Dáil, have a high 
Backroom: Whip ensures Fine Gael ship stays steady on abortion issue
opinion of themselves and know that losing the party whip could leave them politically lonely and exposed when it 
comes to the next election.
The entire parliamentary party is receiving an orchestrated avalanche of communications on the abortion subject. 
Much of it is lurid and unpleasant. But what is surprising many Oireachtas members, especially those old enough to 
remember the convulsions in Fine Gael over abortion in the 1980s, is the public mood. It is clearly very different 
from then.
As one Fine Gael member points out, a big difference in the debate since 1983 is the arrival of the internet and 
Ryanair. Abortion information and availability are comprehensive, close by and (relatively) low-cost.
As far as many TDs can discern, most of their constituents are not greatly exercised on this subject. To the extent 
that there is any common view, it is that people don't like abortion, don't really approve of it, but recognise that there 
are hard cases, difficult personal circumstances and that in such conditions it is best left to individual choice.
Voting against the government is high-risk for members of Fine Gael's crowded parliamentary party.
Some possible rebels hold deep, faith-based views on abortion and they get some grudging respect, but not much, 
from colleagues for this. The majority is largely indifferent, taking the view that politics is a tough business and if 
they lose a constituency running mate or rival for promotion, so much the better.
Younger party loyalists salivate at the prospect that Lucinda Creighton might jump off the cliff and create a junior 
ministerial vacancy.
They all know what happened to Fine Gael blue blood Denis Naughten. Naughten was pitched overboard in July 
2011 when he opposed Reilly's plans to close his local hospital emergency department and has not been taken 
back into the party since.
Enda Kenny has let it be known that he has no qualms about losing his former colleague from a neighbouring 
constituency, and if a few more want to lose the whip he is sanguine about it. The expulsion of Naughten is a clear 
warning to others that Kenny has a ruthless side behind the affable grin.
Kenny was magnanimous to many of his internal opponents when forming his government. Many of those who 
voted against him in 2010 were given cabinet and junior ministerial positions. Leo Varadkar, Richard Bruton, Brian 
Hayes et al are now fully on board as Kenny backers. Lucinda Creighton is still an outlier, but Kenny will have no 
qualms about letting her go if that is what she chooses.
For a parliamentary party of its size and diversity, Kenny has relatively few enemies any more. There is a 
disaffected middle-aged male rump headed by Billy Timmins, Michael Creed and John Deasy, but their mood is as 
much soured by the reality that they have underperformed to their ability and been overtaken by a smarter, younger 
cadre.
Kenny's chief whip, Paul Keogh, and his chief of staff, Mark Kennelly, run closely managed lists of those wobbling 
and those coming back on board. Kenny is a former whip himself and an assiduous worker of his flock. Not every 
influential meeting happens formally in his office. Quiet words in corridors, or over a cup of tea in the restaurant are 
just as effective.
Fianna Fáil's free vote decision is a luxury that the now small party can afford to avoid a damaging split. Some in 
Fine Gael will look wistfully at the main opposition party's decision, but most are pragmatic enough to know that a 
government has to run by the whip and party discipline.
Liam Cosgrave was taoiseach and party leader when Kenny first entered the Dáil in 1975. Kenny will well 
remember that Cosgrave was wont to remark: "If you take the shilling, you follow the drum".

Analysis: Privatising Central and Eastern European carriers

Highlight: Overwhelmed by losses state-owned carriers in Central and Eastern Europe cannot rely on government 
support to continue. Yana Palagacheva asks whether privatisations will allow them to survive and fend off 
competition from low-cost rivals.
Body
In February 2012 the Hungarian government finally gave up on attempts to save state-owned carrier Malev. The 
loss-making airline asked the government for help to continue operations stating that the situation was "unresolved 
from the end of January". However, the Hungarian government was not allowed to subsidize its flag carrier after the 
European Commission ruled that Malev must pay back illegal state aid, which it received between 2007 and 2010.
At 6am on the morning of February 3 the flag carrier shut down after 66 years of continuous operations. The next 
day low-cost carriers Wizz Air and Ryanair took over Malev's routes. Many other state-owned carriers in central and 
eastern Europe are struggling, and the risk to some of them after Malev's fate is growing.
Based on the most recent available financial results, nine-year -old Wizz Air posted a net profit of $54.5 million as of 
March 31 2012. This compares with an annual loss of $45.1 million reported in December 2011 for central Europe's 
biggest state-owned carrier, Lot Polish Airlines.
Most of the other state-owned carriers in the region are also loss-making. Lot is one vivid example of an airline in 
the region going through a lot of pressure. In May the European Commission temporarily approved a rescue loan of 
Zl400 million ($123.5 million) to Lot. The announcement came after previous reports that the carrier would not 
receive any further government support.
The loan aims to enable Lot to pay creditors and maintain operations while implementing its restructuring plan to 
avoid bankruptcy.  Separately there have been continuing talks to potential privatize Air Baltic, Jat Airways, Croatia 
Airlines and Adria Airways.
Finding the right buyer
In April Korean Air bought a 44% stake in troubled flag carrier Czech Airlines saving it, at least temporarily, from 
bankruptcy. The Czech government's intention to sustain the survival of the carrier was evident in the words of 
Miroslav Kalousek, the Czech Republic's minister of finance, who commenting on the acquisition said: "The entry of 
the Korean company represents a guarantee for the Czech Republic and its citizens that a significant Czech 
company with a 90-year-old tradition will not disappear."
Analysis: Privatising Central and Eastern European carriers
Despite governments being determined to save their national carriers, it is questionable how successful their efforts 
will be. Finding parties interested to invest in carriers with high cost structures is challenging, and there seems to be 
a fair risk that some of the state-owned airlines will be wiped away by the low-cost carriers.
Out of 50 big carriers approached by Czech Airlines, for example, only two submitted bids and one of them later 
withdrew. The partial privatization of the carrier was successful but, at the moment, Czech Airlines is the exception 
rather than the rule.
Between a rock and a hard place
Despite the economic growth in the region, national carriers in central and eastern Europe are still constrained by 
several factors, including their state-owned status, high cost structures and rigid union restrictions.
Another issue is size. Aside from Lot, the carriers in the region are too small to achieve genuine economies of 
scale.
In addition, the entry to the European Union has also created big challenges to these national carriers. EU law 
restricts the amount of government support an airline can receive and, at the same time, forces governments to 
open their aviation markets allowing other airlines to compete. Insiders agree that state-owned carriers in central 
and eastern Europe need transformation to their business models to survive. The difficult question is how this 
transformation is going to happen.
Adam Pilarski, senior vice-president, Avitas, believes that many of these airlines need privatization that limits 
government involvement.
"Realistically you have to privatize and do it in a smart way, but they want to have their cake and eat it too. They 
want to privatize those carriers but at the same time have the government run it. That's not going to happen," says 
Pilarski.
Governments' persistence in keeping involved in running those carriers is understandable because there is often 
not enough local money to privatize them, while giving the ownership away to a foreign carrier might endanger local 
interests.
There is no guarantee, for example, that the acquired carrier will not be relegated to a minor supportive role.
Pilarski notes: "On one hand, governments don't have the ability to constantly pour money into a losing business. 
On the other, they obviously don't want a big foreign player to take over the carrier and simply use it as a regional 
hub for their own traffic. The truth is they are between a rock and a hard place."
The state-owned model, however, does not necessarily prevent an airline from being successful. Emirates is one 
example of a state-owned airline which is very profitable because it embraces competition.
Chris Tarry, aviation consultant, Ctaira, notes that ownership should not matter as long as the carrier has the 
chance to apply its best practice.
The real issue comes when a national carrier is run as a government department, which limits market opportunities. 
That opens an issue about the strategic importance of a home airline.
"If you have your national carrier you will have better links to certain cities and this is what matters to the 
government," says Tarry. "Even the governments though will see no sense in sustaining the unsustainable."
Michael Duff, managing director, The Airline Analyst, is also sceptical of the survival of some of the airlines in the 
region.
"The reality of the competitive situation is that not every country needs a national carrier any more. I would imagine 
more state-owned airlines in the region ceasing operations," says Duff.
Analysis: Privatising Central and Eastern European carriers
"Some will go to a greater length to sustain the survival of a national carrier, but what is the incentive of investors to 
put money in if their cost structures make it very difficult for them to compete with the likes of Wizzair and Ryanair?" 
he adds.
Start-ups
The possibility of national carriers in the region going bust creates an opportunity for start-ups with better business 
models in the region. The strength of Wizz Air, which started operations only nine years ago, is one example of the 
success of the low-cost model in the region.
The LCCs are likely to gain even bigger popularity in eastern Europe because passengers tend to compromise on 
service rather than on price.
"I think that there will be more start-ups, some of them will be low-cost, and some will be successful," says Pilarski.
The biggest challenge to the potential start-ups is the existing low-cost carriers. Wizz Air, Ryanair and easyJet 
already have a strong presence in the region, and they keep on growing their route network. This might not leave 
many potential business opportunities up for grabs for a start-up airline. Non-low-cost carriers, which are already 
well recognized, have also expressed interest in the region. Aeroflot, for example, has made it clear that it plans to 
expand into eastern Europe.
The major factors for an airline's success are the brand, market reach, revenue and cost management. All those 
criteria might be difficult for a start-up in the region to achieve, according to Tarry.
"As soon as potential start-ups develop their market Ryanair or easyJet will come in and see this as a business 
opportunity. The difficulty for airlines starting up is how they defend their market," says Tarry.
The government's job is to ensure not only safety but also a competitive market. Historically, it has been very 
difficult to compete against state owned enterprises in the region.
Governments may be tempted to protect their flag carriers by creating hurdles for potential start-ups. One way of 
doing that is delaying or denying regulatory approvals.
However, the Malev case should serve as a stark warning to many of these governments. Ultimately, the fate of 
these national carriers will depend on how successfully they can be privatized. Lot should be a good test case. If 
the Polish government can privatize it, and resist the temptation to exert its influence on its new owners, then the 
airline has some hope of recovery. But if the government cannot step away, it can only spell more trouble for an 
already troubled airline.

The ISEQ shed the gains it made through the last week and the early days of this week as investors took stock and 
eyed consolidation in the global equity markets.
The index was down 28.39 points today to 4,012.90.
European shares edged lower, hit by profit taking, but were still poised to end May with a record 12th consecutive 
monthly gain. Analysts said equities were likely to remain in demand a while longer, as long as economic data 
remained weak enough to justify continued stimulus from global central banks - the key driver of the past year's 
market gains. U.S. GDP growth data released on Thursday was below forecasts and new jobless benefit claims 
rose.
Shares in Aer Lingus climbed 7c to E1.62 after its board today said it has agreed to Labour Court recommendations 
which include a once-off payment of E110m and an additional once-off E30m payment to deferred members of the 
IASS scheme. "We believe that a resolution to the IASS pension deficit issue and clarity on labour costs over the 
medium term will provide investors with an increased level of certainty on the company's obligations," said Davy. 
Ryanair, still smarting over yesterday's ruling on its Aer Lingus stake by UK competition authorities, saw its shares 
fall 11c to E6.85.

European shares edged lower today, hit by profit taking, but were still poised to end May with a record 12th 
consecutive monthly gain. Analysts said equities were likely to remain in demand a while longer, as long as 
economic data remained weak enough to justify continued stimulus from global central banks - the key driver of the 
past year's market gains. U.S. GDP growth data released on Thursday was below forecasts and new jobless

which include a once-off payment of E110m and an additional once-off E30m payment to deferred members of the 
IASS scheme. "We believe that a resolution to the IASS pension deficit issue and clarity on labour costs over the 
medium term will provide investors with an increased level of certainty on the company's obligations," said Davy. 
Ryanair, still smarting over yesterday's ruling on its Aer Lingus stake by UK competition authorities, saw its shares 
fall 16c to E6.80.

Body
(RTTNews) - Irish low cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) condemned the Board and Management 
of Aer Lingus (AERL.L) which has accepted the latest crazy Irish Labour Court recommendation that another 170 
million euros to 200 million euros of shareholder funds be squandered to compensate Aer Lingus staff for a pension 
deficit which Aer Lingus has repeatedly assured shareholders is a defined contribution or 'DC' pension scheme, and 
for which Aer Lingus has no further liability.
" If, as Aer Lingus' IPO prospectus (and every subsequent annual report) confirmed, neither Aer Lingus nor its 
shareholders have any liability towards this 'DC' pension scheme, then why is yet another 170 million euros to 200 
million euros being wasted on yet another pay off for Aer Lingus' staff," Ryanair Holdings said in a statement.
Ryanair said it many times pointed out that that Aer Lingus' staff have blackmailed the Government and trade union 
controlled Board of Aer Lingus, to enrich themselves at shareholders expense at a total cost of over 600 million 
euros and rising.
Ryanair believed that these 600 million euros staff pay-offs over 7 years shows that the Board of Aer Lingus, which 
is controlled by the Irish Government and trade union bosses, cannot be trusted with shareholder funds. They roll 
over every time they are threatened. Ryanair believed that Aer Lingus will, with the connivance of the Irish 
Government, continue to squander shareholder funds every time they are threatened by the vested interests of 
staff.
Ryanair said over the past 7 years since Aer Lingus' flotation, more than 600 million euros in "exceptional 
payments" has been unjustifiably snatched by staff, while the Board and Management repeatedly promise 
shareholders that each time would be the "last time".
Ryanair noted that it will vote against this unwarranted and unjustified pay-off of up to 200 million euros to a 'DC' 
pension scheme which Aer Lingus has confirmed it has no liability for. However since Ryanair's minority stake gives 
it no influence or control over Aer Lingus it will yet again be voted down by the Government and unions who control 
and run Aer Lingus.
Ryanair believed that this 600 million euros to 630 million euros of exceptional payments to Aer Lingus staff over 
the last 7 years since its IPO is a scandal which must be exposed and ended. Ryanair calls on the Board of Aer 
Lingus to stand up for shareholders and resist this industrial relations blackmail by unions and staff.

European semiconductor stocks were boosted by a positive outlook on the sector from analysts at JPMorgan.
Shares in STMicroelectronics , the Franco-Italian group, yesterday rose 2.1 per cent to EUR7.34 after JPMorgan 
named it as a key pick in the sector as it was beginning to benefit from cost cuts and the improving business cycle. 
The broker also named Germany's Infineon Technologies, which rose 3.3 per cent to EUR6.61.
Thanks also to gains for a number of financials and UK-listed mining stocks, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 closed 0.3 per 
cent higher at 1,227.41 - putting in a resilient performance after a 5 per cent fall in Tokyo.
"Over the last couple of weeks, the negativity in Asia has followed through to the European session, but we're not 
seeing this today as investors sit on the sidelines and see how things play out," said Craig Erlam at Alpari UK.
The day's eurozone data were also supportive as economic sentiment within the single currency bloc continued to 
improve .
There were some strong performances in the insurance sector. Germany's Allianz climbed 2.8 per cent to 
EUR121.80 after Nomura raised its rating from neutral to buy and its target price from EUR103 to EUR140. Allianz 
was "firing on all cylinders" the broker said, with earnings growth driven by all business segments.
Dutch insurer Aegon climbed 4.5 per cent to EUR5.38 after it completed the conversion of its preferred shares.
Airlines were buoyed by data from the International Air Transport Association that showed global passenger traffic 
rose 3.2 per cent in April from last year. Lufthansa rose 4.4 per cent to EUR16.84 while Air France-KLM added 
2.4 per cent to EUR7.68.
Ryanair climbed 1 per cent to EUR6.96 even after it came under regulatory pressure from the UK Competition 
Commission to sell its 30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus , whose shares added 1.3 per cent to EUR1.55.
Linde , the German industrial gases group, fell 2.2 per cent to EUR149.05 after Citigroup cut its rating.

THE saga of Michael O'Leary's pursuit of Aer Lingus is showing no signs of coming to an end. After his surprise 
£595m bid for the 70 per cent of Ryanair's Irish baby brother he doesn't already own was blocked by the European 
Commission last summer, the outspoken chief executive is understandably bearing something of a grudge towards 
the antitrust authorities.
His latest war of words is likely to drag things out even further. Though a decision is due from the UK Competition 
Commission in less than six weeks, a negative outcome for Ryanair will no doubt mean a lengthy appeal - but one 
analysts expect to end with O'Leary giving up and offloading at least part of his stake. In the meantime investors are 
left with the one thing they hate most - uncertainty.
With no idea how much, if any, use the Aer Lingus stake will be to Ryanair in the long term, the ambiguity will be a 
drag on its share price for the forseeable future.
It's a disappointing shift in momentum: Ryanair's stock price has shot up more than 46 per cent since January - and 
won't be helped by the fact that shareholders are already waiting with bated breath for the (EURO)500m special 
dividend that the airline says could come some time in the next two years.
O'Leary is no stranger to speaking out, but if he wants to keep investors onside he must urgently answer their 
questions.

Ryanair could be forced to sell its 30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus after a ruling by the UK's Competition 
Commission.
In a provisional ruling published yesterday, the commission found that allowing Ryanair to maintain its stake in its 
Irish rival could reduce competition on routes between the UK and Ireland and hinder Aer Lingus's ability to be 
acquired or merge with another airline.
"While not giving it control over day-to-day running of its rival, Ryanair's minority shareholding can influence the 
major strategic decisions that could be crucial to Aer Lingus's future as a competitive airline on these and other 
routes," said Simon Polito, the commission's deputy chairman.
The commission found Ryanair 's shareholding allowed it to block special resolutions by Aer Lingus and to hinder 
its plans to issue shares and raise capital. Ryanair could also prevent its rival from disposing of its valuable slots at 
Heathrow, said the ruling.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, described the ruling as "bizarre and manifestly wrong".
"The commission's finding that Ryanair's shareholding obstructs Aer Lingus's ability to attract other airlines was 
disproved by Etihad's purchase of a 3 per cent stake and the evidence submitted by other large EU airlines," he 
said.
Potential remedies published in the latest ruling include forcing the airline to sell all or part of its 29.8 per cent stake 
and imposing safeguards on Ryanair to protect competition.
The ruling marks the latest blow delivered by regulators to Ryanair's attempt to control Aer Lingus. In February, 
Brussels blocked Ryanair's third bid in eight years to take over the airline, ruling that the proposed transaction 
would increase fares for passengers and create a monopoly on 46 UK-Irish routes.
Regulator eyes Ryanair stake in Aer Lingus TRAVEL & leisure
The commission has begun a consultation on the findings, which is scheduled to close on June 20. It is expected to 
publish its final report by July 11. It has the power to order companies to divest a minority stake if it finds the holding 
enables the owner to influence a target company in a way that harms competition. In 2010, for example, BSkyB had 
to sell 10 per cent of a 17.9 per cent minority stake that it held in ITV.
Aer Lingus welcomed the provisional findings by the commission, saying: "Aer Lingus looks forward to continuing to 
assist the UK Competition Commission in its investigation into the anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority 
shareholding."
Mr O'Leary, however, said that UK taxpayers' interests would be better served if the commission investigated British 
Airways' takeovers of BMI, Iberia and Vueling.

Ryanair could be forced to sell its near-30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus following a ruling by the UK's Competition

Aer Lingus's board of directors has backed a proposal to make a once-off contribution of E140 million to employee 
pensions as part of a deal to avoid possible strikes at the airline.
The deal aims to address a hole in a pension scheme which employees at Aer Lingus share with other aviation 
industry workers and which had a deficit of over 700 million euros at the end of 2011.
The threat of a large pay-out has weighed on the Aer Lingus share price in recent years.
The proposal will be put to shareholders following talks with unions and pension fund trustees and will be 
implemented if staff and union members also agree, Aer Lingus said in a statement today. Low-cost airline Ryanair, 
which owns 30 percent of Aer Lingus and this year failed in a third takeover attempt, has said it opposes a pension 
pay-out, but does not have enough votes to block it alone. Britain's Competition Commission is to rule by July on 
whether to force Ryanair to sell its stake in Aer Lingus due to competition concerns.

which owns 30 percent of Aer Lingus and this year failed in a third takeover attempt, has said it opposes a pension 
pay-out, but does not have enough votes to block it alone. Britain's Competition Commission is to rule by July on 
whether to force Ryanair to sell its stake in Aer Lingus due to competition concerns.

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary lashed out at the UK's competition regulator yesterday, after it said it may force the 
budget airline to sell down its stake in smaller rival Aer Lingus.
O'Leary said that the Competition Commission's concerns that Ryanair's stake meant it could unfairly influence 
strategy at Aer Lingus was "bizarre and manifestly wrong". He also claimed it broke EU laws by contradicting an 
earlier decision by the European Commission.
"This case ... is yet another enormous waste of UK taxpayer resources on a case which has little if any impact on 
UK consumers," he claimed.
In a preliminary ruling, the Competition Commission said the 29.8 per cent shareholding could obstruct Aer Lingus' 
ability to merge with another airline, raise capital or sell its valuable slots at London's Heathrow Airport.
It proposed three options available to Ryanair to remedy the problem - selling its entire stake, selling down the 
stake, or an agreement on how it would use its influence in the future.
A final decision will be made in July.

The ISEQ barely moved this morning after three days of losses with Ryanair and Aer Lingus in focus after a UK 
competition authority ruling on Ryanair's stake in its rival.
By 12:30, the index was up 0.68 of a point to 4,035.81.
Shares in Ryanair rose 4c to E6.93 and Aer Lingus gained 2c to E1.55.
Ryanair may be forced to sell at least part of its stake in Aer Lingus following provisional findings published by the 
UK Competition Commission today. The Commission has concluded that the 29.8pc stake in Aer Lingus gives 
Ryanair the ability to influence the commercial policy and strategy of the airline, its main competitor on routes 
between Ireland and the UK. The Commission said it has provisionally found that Ryanair's shareholding obstructs 
Aer Lingus's ability to merge or combine with another airline to build scale and achieve synergies to remain 
competitive. The CC has also found that Ryanair's shareholding allows it to block special resolutions by Aer Lingus 
and to hinder its plans to issue shares and raise capital. Shares in Kerry Group fell 7c to E44.11. Tate and Lyle 
reported 4pc rise in profits for the year to end March. Within this its Speciality Food Ingredients division saw a 7pc lfl 
increase in sales including a 4pc rise in volumes. The company noted that a third of new product launches in 
Western Europe in 2012 were targeted toward the "natural" segment with, for example, "cleaner label" attributed. 
"The underlying Tate's sweetener based ingredients also hold true for much of Kerry Ingredients' portfolio where we 
anticipate underlying volume growth of c.4pc annually," said Goodbody's.

Ryanair may be required by UK competition authorities to trim its stake in Aer Lingus Group Plc over concerns that 
its 29.8 per cent holding may lead to higher prices on routes between the UK and Ireland.

The ISEQ broke out of the red today after three days of losses with Ryanair and Aer Lingus in focus after a UK 
competition authority ruling on Ryanair's stake in its rival.
The index was up 6.16 points to 4,041.29.
Shares in Ryanair rose 7c to E6.96 and Aer Lingus gained 2c to E1.55.
Ryanair may be forced to sell at least part of its stake in Aer Lingus following provisional findings published by the 
UK Competition Commission today. The Commission has concluded that the 29.8pc stake in Aer Lingus gives 
Ryanair the ability to influence the commercial policy and strategy of the airline, its main competitor on routes 
between Ireland and the UK. The Commission said it has provisionally found that Ryanair's shareholding obstructs 
Aer Lingus's ability to merge or combine with another airline to build scale and achieve synergies to remain 
competitive. The CC has also found that Ryanair's shareholding allows it to block special resolutions by Aer Lingus 
and to hinder its plans to issue shares and raise capital. Shares in Kerry Group fell 7c to E44.11. Tate and Lyle 
reported 4pc rise in profits for the year to end March. Within this its Speciality Food Ingredients division saw a 7pc lfl 
increase in sales including a 4pc rise in volumes. The company noted that a third of new product launches in 
Western Europe in 2012 were targeted toward the "natural" segment with, for example, "cleaner label" attributed. 
"The underlying Tate's sweetener based ingredients also hold true for much of Kerry Ingredients' portfolio where we 
anticipate underlying volume growth of c.4pc annually," said Goodbody's. Elan's stocks fell 8c to E9.42 after it said 
today it would present shareholders with an alternative strategy if they reject a string of deals it announced recently 
and thereby make it more likely that Royalty Pharma will acquire the Irish drug firm. Royalty last week increased a 
hostile cash bid for Elan to dollar 12.50 per share from dollar 11.25, but made the new offer conditional on Elan 
shareholders rejecting the series of defensive transactions at a meeting due to be held on June 17.

Ryanair today rejected a ruling from the UK competition authorities that it will have to reduce its 29.8pc stake in rival 
Aer Lingus amid concerns over competition on key routes between Ireland and the UK.
The UK Competition Commission said the stake, built up during a failed takeover bid for Aer Lingus in 2006, gives 
Ryanair "the ability to influence the commercial policy and strategy" of its rival.
It also prevents Aer Lingus from merging with another airline and could hinder it from issuing new shares or raising 
capital, the commission said.
The regulator published the provisional findings of its investigation into the stake, with a full ruling due in July. "Our 
provisional view is that Ryanair's shareholding is likely to weaken its main competitor on routes between Great 
Britain and the Republic of Ireland," said Simon Polito, deputy chairman of the Competition Commission. "Whilst not 
giving it control over the day to day running of its rival, Ryanair's minority shareholding can influence the major 
strategic decisions that could be crucial to Aer Lingus's future as a competitive airline on these and other routes." 
Ryanair described the ruling as an "unfounded claim disproven by the European Commission's recent (Feb 2013) 
ruling that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has "intensified" since 2007". "Under EU law, the UK CC 
has a duty of 'sincere cooperation' with the EU, and cannot contradict or reach different conclusions to the 
European Commission's findings. Inexplicably, today's provisional decision by the CC infringes this duty of sincere 
co-operation by ignoring the recent findings of the European Commission that: 'Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete on 
a greater number of routes compared to the 2007 Decision" and "there is significant competitive interaction between 
the Parties" and "evidence collected by the Commission in the market investigation has also confirmed that the 
competitive relationship between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has at least persisted, if not increased, since 2007'." Aer 
Lingus welcomed the UK watchdog's findings. "Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") welcomes today's 
announcement by the UK Competition Commission regarding the provisional findings of its investigation into 
Ryanair slams UK body on A Lingus stake Ryn AL Stake
Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus looks forward to continuing to assist the UK Competition 
Commission in its investigation into the anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding. The issuing of 
the final report is expected by 11 July 2013," it said.

Federal Reserve to reduce its bond-buying program.
Data on weekly jobless claims and pending home sales as well as revised first-quarter GDP are scheduled to be 
released in the U.S. later in the global day.
Eurozone economic confidence strengthened in May, driven by brightening sentiment in all business sectors except 
for construction, survey results published by the European Commission showed.
Residential property prices in the U.K. increased at the fastest pace in one-and-half years in May, as the recovery in 
housing demand gained strength on the back of the government's recent initiative to give banks access to cheaper 
credit.

Fresnillo is gaining 4.2 percent and International Consolidated Airlines is adding close to 3 percent.
Retailer Kingfisher, which reported quarterly results, is advancing around 1 percent.
Tate & Lyle is falling 1.2 percent after reporting annual results.

61/2 year old minority or 29.8 percent shareholding in Aer Lingus is likely to lead to higher prices between its 
routes.
Elsewhere in Europe, the German DAX and the French CAC 40 are in positive territory while Switzerland's SMI is

Ryanair : UK CC Provisional Decision Is Breach Of EU Law, To Appeal The Decision

(RTTNews) - Irish low cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) criticised the UK Competition 
Commission's or CC's provisional decision that Ryanair, through its 61/2 year old minority or 29.8% shareholding in 
Aer Lingus (AERL.L), 'has influence' over Aer Lingus and that this 'could reduce competition'.
Ryanair said that the unfounded claim was disproven by the European Commission's recent (February 2013) ruling 
that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has "intensified" since 2007.
Under EU law, the UK CC has a duty of "sincere cooperation" with the EU, and cannot contradict or reach different 
conclusions to the European Commission's findings, Ryanair noted.
Ryanair stated that it will appeal that decision to the UK Competition Appeals Tribunal and thereafter, if necessary, 
to the Court of Appeal. Until the outcome of this UK appeal, and the completion of Ryanair's appeal against the 
European Commission's February 2013 prohibition decision, the CC cannot impose any remedies, however 
unlawful, on Ryanair.
Ryanair stated that the provisional decision by the UK CC is bizarre and manifestly wrong. The CC's finding that 
Ryanair's shareholding obstructs Aer Lingus' ability to attract other airlines was disproved by Etihad's purchase of a 
3% stake and the evidence submitted by other large EU airlines, which confirmed that Ryanair's shareholding was 
not a barrier to other airlines acquiring a stake in Aer Lingus.
In a separate press release, Aer Lingus Group said it welcomes today's announcement by the UK Competition 
Commission regarding the provisional findings of its investigation into Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus.
Aer Lingus said it looks forward to continuing to assist the UK Competition Commission in its investigation into the 
anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding. The issuing of the final report is expected by 11 July 
2013.

(RTTNews) - Irish low cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) may have to reduce its stake in Aer Lingus 
(AERL.L), as the UK Competition Commission's or CC has provisionally decided that Ryanair's 61/2 year old 
minority or 29.8 percent shareholding in Aer Lingus is likely to lead to higher prices between its routes.
The CC has also provisionally found that, against a background of consolidation in the airline industry, Ryanair's 
shareholding obstructs Aer Lingus's ability to merge with another airline in order to achieve synergies to remain 
competitive.
Ryanair noted that Aer Lingus has only a tiny presence in the UK, serving just 6 routes to the Republic of Ireland, a 
traffic base that has declined over the past 3 years and now accounts for less than 1 percent of all UK air traffic.
However, Ryanair has criticised the CC's decision that through its shareholding in Aer Lingus, Ryanair has 
'influence' over Aer Lingus and that this could reduce competition. Ryanair stated that the unfounded claim was 
disproven by the European Commission's ruling in February, 2013 that competition between Ryanair and Aer 
Lingus has 'intensified' since 2007.
Under EU law, the UK CC has a duty of sincere cooperation with the EU, and cannot contradict or reach different 
conclusions to the European Commission's findings.
According to Ryanair, today's provisional decision by the CC infringes this duty of sincere co-operation by ignoring 
the recent findings of the European Commission that "Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete on a greater number of 
routes compared to the 2007 Decision' and 'there is significant competitive interaction between the Parties."
Ryanair stated that it will appeal to the UK Competition Appeals Tribunal and thereafter, if necessary, to the Court 
of Appeal. The CC's final decision is due in July.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said, "This provisional decision by the UK CC is bizarre and manifestly wrong. The CC's 
finding that Ryanair's shareholding obstructs Aer Lingus' ability to attract other airlines was disproved by Etihad's 
purchase of a 3% stake and the evidence submitted by other large EU airlines, which confirmed that Ryanair's 
shareholding was not a barrier to other airlines acquiring a stake in Aer Lingus."
In a separate press release, Aer Lingus welcomed the announcement by the UK Competition Commission 
regarding the provisional findings of its investigation into Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus. The 
UK Competition Commission Says Ryanair May Have To Reduce Stake In Aer Lingus
company said it looks forward to continuing to assist the UK Competition Commission in its investigation. The 
issuing of the final report is expected by July 11, 2013.
In August 2012, Ryanair had said that it intends to re-bid for Aer Lingus if the European Commission clears its offer 
following its Phase II review.
In June 2012, Ryanair had said that it plans to make an all-cash offer of 1.30 euros per share for Aer Lingus, 
valuing that company at about 694 million euros or $879 million.
Ryanair had first tried to acquire Aer Lingus in late 2006, but that bid was blocked by the European Commission on 
antitrust grounds.
RYA.L is currently trading at 6.93 euros, up 0.06 percent.

(RTTNews) - The European markets pared their gains in the afternoon, but largely finished in the green Thursday. 
Banks and mining stocks were among the best performing stocks. The unexpected downward revision of the U.S. 
GDP result for the first quarter had a negative impact on the markets. Pending home sales in the U.S. also 
increased less than expected and jobless claims unexpectedly climbed.
Italy's benchmark 10-year borrowing costs increased at an auction on Thursday, similar to the trend seen in yields 
of other Eurozone nations after the Federal Reserve hinted that it will scale back bond purchases in the coming 
months if the US economy improves.
The treasury sold the maximum targeted EUR 5.75 billion of bonds maturing in 2018 and 2023. The May 2023 
BTPs were sold at 4.14 percent yield compared to 3.94 percent at the previous issue in April.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks increased by 0.45 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, added 0.21 percent.
The DAX of Germany climbed by 0.76 percent and the CAC 40 of France advanced by 0.56 percent. The FTSE 100 
of the U.K. rose by 0.45 percent, but the SMI of Switzerland fell by 0.09 percent.
In Frankfurt, Linde declined by 0.30 percent. Citigroup downgraded its rating on the stock to ''Neutral'' from ''Buy.''
Nomura upgraded Allianz to ''Buy'' from ''Neutral.'' The stock climbed by 2.66 percent.
Deutsche Bank advanced by 1.61 percent and Commerzbank added 0.55 percent.
KWS Saat dropped by 2.23 percent, after HSBC downgraded the stock to ''Underweight'' from ''Neutral.''
In Paris, Renault dipped by 0.60 percent. Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on the stock to ''Sell'' from 
''Neutral.''
Credit Agricole climbed by 1.30 percent and BNP Paribas added 0.80 percent. Societe Generale finished with a 
gain of 0.26 percent.
In London, mining stocks rebounded from yesterday's weakness. Anglo American increased by 1.59 percent and 
Antofagasta climbed by 1.32 percent. Fresnillo rose by 6.15 percent and Glencore Xstrata gained 1.83 percent. 
European Markets Trimmed Gains Following U.S. Economic Reports
Randgold Resources advanced by 5.75 percent and Rio Tinto added 2.53 percent. Vedanta Resources also 
finished higher by 1.87 percent.
Royal Bank of Scotland climbed by 1.69 percent and HSBC added 1.14 percent. Barclays rose by 0.80 percent and 
Lloyds Banking Group gained 1.91 percent.
Kingfisher increased by 6.68 percent, after the retailer reported quarterly results.
Tate & Lyle declined by 1.47 percent, after reporting annual results.
Ryanair finished higher by 0.52 percent. The U.K. Competition Commission has provisionally decided that the low-
cost airline's 61/2 year old minority, or 29.8 percent, shareholding in Aer Lingus is likely to lead to higher prices 
between its routes.
John Wood Group climbed by 1.86 percent, after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to "Overweight" from "Equal 
weight."
Tesco fell by 1.54 percent, after JP Morgan downgraded the stock to "Neutral" from "Overweight."
Eurozone economic sentiment picked up moderately in May, driven by improved confidence in all business sectors 
except for construction, survey results published by the European Commission showed Thursday. The economic 
sentiment index climbed to 89.4 in May, in line with expectations, from 88.6 in April.
Recession in Spain slowed as initially estimated in the first quarter, final data released by the statistical office INE 
showed Thursday. Gross domestic product was down 0.5 percent sequentially, slower than the 0.8 percent drop 
seen in the previous quarter. GDP has now contracted for six consecutive quarters.
Residential property prices in the U.K. increased at the fastest pace in one-and-half years in May, as the recovery in 
housing demand gained strength on the back of the government's recent initiative to give banks access to cheaper 
credit.
The house price index moved up 1.1 percent from a year earlier, after gaining 0.9 percent in April, a survey by the 
Nationwide Building Society revealed Thursday. The last time a bigger growth was recorded was in November 
2011, when prices grew 1.6 percent. Economists had forecast the growth rate to remain unchanged at the April 
level.
U.S. economic activity in the first three months of 2013 grew by slightly less than previously estimated, according to 
a report released by the Commerce Department on Thursday. The report said gross domestic product increased at 
an annual rate of 2.4 percent in the first quarter compared to the previously reported 2.5 percent growth. 
Economists had expected GDP to be unrevised.
After reporting a drop in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the previous week, the Labor 
Department released a report on Thursday showing that initial jobless claims moved back to the upside in the week 
ended May 25th.
The report said initial jobless claims climbed to 354,000, an increase of 10,000 from the previous week's revised 
figure of 344,000. The rebound surprised economists, who had expected jobless claims to come in unchanged 
compared to the 340,000 originally reported for the previous week.
Pending home sales in the U.S. increased by much less than expected in the month of April, according to a report 
released by the National Association of Realtors on Thursday, with gains in the Northeast and Midwest largely 
offset by declines in the West and South.
NAR said its pending home sales index edged up by 0.3 percent to 106.0 in April after jumping by 1.5 percent to 
105.7 in March. Economists had been expecting the index to increase by about 1.4 percent.

A new study today reveals that a total of E17.5 million in excess baggage fees was paid out by Irish air passengers 
in the past year, with an average fee of E46 per person.
Despite this, 55 per cent are unaware of the impending baggage charge increases from Aer Lingus and Ryanair for 
the peak summer period from June to September, with only 12 per cent knowing the exact increase.
The study by lastminute.com also found that busy families with children are caught out by excess fees more than 
individuals.
When asked if airlines should calculate the baggage allowance for families and groups as a combined weight, 85pc 
of those surveyed believed they should. "The study reveals that customers in Ireland are needlessly spending 
money they could be enjoying on their holiday on excess baggage fees. With so many unaware of the imminent 
peak time hikes this figure could rise. However, by checking out baggage allowances before travelling and packing 
cleverly you can save yourself from any unpleasant surprises at the airport," said Reigo Eljas, Head of Flight

Aer Lingus today launched a High Court action in an attempt to have a Takeover Panel ruling that could mean 
Ryanair might try to take Aer Lingus over again quashed.
Back in February, the EU Commission ruled against Ryanair's E694m takeover bid, saying that such a merger 
would harm consumers by creating a dominant company on 46 routes where the carriers are currently competing.
Last week, the Irish Takeover Panel ruled that if Ryanair decides to make another offer for Aer Lingus, it must wait 
until August of this year - some 12 months after the bid was first tabled.
The panel is the body responsible for monitoring and supervising takeovers and other relevant transactions in 
companies in Ireland. It prohibits bidders from making a further offer for a public company within a year of the date 
on which their original offer has lapsed. Aer Lingus disputes that ruling. It says that the 12-month period starts from 
February when the EU Commission decided to block Ryanair's offer. Today when the matter was briefly mentioned 
before the High Court Paul Sreenan SC, for Aer Lingus, said it was Aer Lingus's intention to seek to have the 
takeover panel's decision judicially reviewed. It was Aer Lingus's case that Ryanair cannot make another bid to take 
over Aer Lingus until February of next year at the earliest. Counsel added that the takeover panel's decision was 
"wrong in law", adding that they are seeking an order from the court quashing the panel's decision. Ryanair and its 
subsidiary Coinside Ltd, through which the bid for Aer Lingus was made, are notice parties to the action. Mr Justice 
John Cooke, noted Aer Lingus's intention to seek permission to bring judicial review proceedings and adjourned the 
matter to 10 June.

**Test for Abenomics:**Things were going great for Japan until last Thursday. The world's third-largest economy 
had a humming first quarter of 0.9 per cent growth as the yen fell, boosting exports. Quantitative easing appeared 
to be working, as the stock market soared to all-time highs. Then a sell-off of more than 7 per cent rattled market 
nerves, prompting global declines. More to come?
.........................
**Take the short haul:**Low cost means high profits from Ryanair. The airline now has 20 per cent of the European 
short-haul market -- a position which helped it to achieve record profits of EUR 569 million in the year to March 31, 
a 13 per cent increase. Chief executive Michael O'Leary is expecting traffic growth of just 3 per cent this year, but 
has guided profits of up to EUR 600 million.
.........................
**Anything you can do:**Elan and chief executive Kelly Martin unanimously rejected a higher takeover offer from 
Royalty Pharma, saying the proposal "substantially undervalues the company". Royalty raised its bid to $6.4 billion 
last Monday. The same day, Elan announced two acquisitions and a minority investment worth nearly $1.4 billion in 
a bid to fend off the takeover.
.........................
**Gold against the sold:**Hedge funds are making the biggest bet ever against gold prices, signalling continued 
volatility for the metal after prices entered a bear market. Gains in short contracts are usually followed by increases 
in a gauge of price swings for the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion-backed exchange-traded fund. Bullion has 
tumbled 18 per cent this year.

to repay, according to new research that raises fresh concerns about how they operate. Sunday Telegraph: The 
new chief executive of the Co-operative Group is to brief his board on the full extent of the problems at its banking 
arm for the first time after holding reassuring talks with the banking regulator. Sunday Telegraph: FirstGroup chief

on a rich vein of UK performance. The Observer (Comment): Just when you think Congress can't get any dumber, it 
crafts a $1 trillion farm bill that harms the poor and promotes unhealthy food. The Observer (Comment): Countries 
are competing to provide the biggest tax breaks, the cheapest labour and the easiest regulation to attract the likes 
of Google, Apple and Amazon, to the disadvantage of their own citizens.

European markets reversed much of their May gains this week as investors sold out of equities amid global growth 
concerns.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 lost 1.7 per cent over the week to close at 1,226.58. Banks were among the most unloved 
stocks.
"Uncertainty on the Chinese economy and global monetary policy triggered turmoil in the markets - but we see this 
as a correction, not the start of a new trend," Danske Bank analysts wrote in a note to clients.
In Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank fell 6.8 per cent to EUR34.95 against a 1.1 per cent loss on the Xetra Dax.
In Spain, shares in Banco de Sabadell slipped 7.5 per cent to EUR1.45, while the benchmark Ibex 35 closed down 
3.7 per cent over the week. Italian lender Intesa Sanpaolo slumped 6.4 per cent to EUR1.38, against a 4 per cent 
fall on the FTSE MIB.
Investors sent shares in Metro rallying 8.3 per cent to EUR26.90 after analysts at Morgan Stanley upgraded their 
rating in the German retail group for the first time in nearly a decade.
Shares in Elan also received a fillip after the Irish pharmaceutical group's board unanimously rejected Royal 
Pharma's $6.5bn bid.
Royal Pharma, a US private equity group that buys royalty streams, previously made a $5.7bn takeover bid which 
Elan called a "misplaced or naive offer".
Investors gave their vote of confidence, sending the shares up 7.3 per cent to EUR9.52.
Record full-year profits from Ryanair sent shares in the budget airline up 6.5 per cent to EUR6.74.

Body
The prospect of industrial action in schools in the autumn increased last night after the executives of two teaching 
unions effectively rejected the proposed new public service deal, now known as the Haddington Road Agreement.
The Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) and the Teachers Union of Ireland (TUI) said that the 
proposals, which were drawn up earlier this week and published yesterday, did not go far enough.
The unions said the revised document "does not represent sufficient change from the original proposals" (then 
known as the Croke Park II proposals) which were rejected in a ballot last month.
The Irish Times
XXXX In an unusually forceful statement yesterday, the governor of the Central Bank and head of the financial 
regulator Patrick Honohan told a conference that "non-cooperative mortgage borrowers really are at risk of losing 
their homes . . . repossession is an available option for the lender. It would be unwise to imagine it otherwise. If the 
banks were unable to make repossessions then the incentive for the borrower to cooperate would be greatly 
weakened". In a frequently made criticism of the banks, the governor said "mortgage lenders need to address the 
problem of non-performing mortgage debt more energetically. The time for passivity is long past". Among the most 
needed actions by the banks, he said, was identifying those who can't pay their mortgages from those who are 
"merely reluctant to pay". The Irish Times XXXX Aer Lingus has told pilots at the airline that it will not pay 
incremental increases that were due last month. It is understood that management at the company has told pilots 
that it would not make any adjustment to pay rates pending completion of talks both on dealing with significant 
financial difficulties in their pension scheme and in relation a general review of remuneration which is currently 
under way under the chairmanship of senior counsel Gerry Durcan. The overall cost-containment plan at Aer 
Lingus, known as "Greenfield" ended late last year and it is understood that pilots' representatives argued that the 
Roundup-Repossessions inevitable; News Roundup
payment of increments should have taken place at the beginning of April. The Irish Times XXXX The former mission 
chief for the International Monetary Fund in Ireland, Mr Chopra told a conference in Dublin that the IMF favoured 
the direct recapitalisation of the banks if necessary. Analysts are growing increasingly concerned that Irish banks 
are going to need even more capital in order to cover losses from the number of mortgages that are either in 
arrears or in default. The Irish Independent XXXX Easyjet confirmed it has agreed to buy 25 slot pairs from Flybe 
for £20m (E23.3m), with the transaction subject to approval from Flybe shareholders. Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary confirmed this week that the airline had submitted a bid to buy the Flybe slots at Gatwick, which is 
Easyjet's biggest base. Ryanair's biggest base is Stansted, and it's about the fourth biggest operator at Gatwick. Mr 
O'Leary said that the Gatwick slots that had been put up for sale were attractive. "We've submitted a bid to Flybe for 
the slots and I think it would be a material opportunity for us there," he said. The Irish Independent

The prospect of industrial action in schools in the autumn increased last night after the executives of two teaching 
unions effectively rejected the proposed new public service deal, now known as the Haddington Road Agreement.
The Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) and the Teachers Union of Ireland (TUI) said that the 
proposals, which were drawn up earlier this week and published yesterday, did not go far enough.
The unions said the revised document "does not represent sufficient change from the original proposals" (then 
known as the Croke Park II proposals) which were rejected in a ballot last month.

XXXX In an unusually forceful statement yesterday, the governor of the Central Bank and head of the financial 
regulator Patrick Honohan told a conference that "non-cooperative mortgage borrowers really are at risk of losing 
their homes . . . repossession is an available option for the lender. It would be unwise to imagine it otherwise. If the 
banks were unable to make repossessions then the incentive for the borrower to cooperate would be greatly 
weakened". In a frequently made criticism of the banks, the governor said "mortgage lenders need to address the 
problem of non-performing mortgage debt more energetically. The time for passivity is long past". Among the most 
needed actions by the banks, he said, was identifying those who can't pay their mortgages from those who are 
"merely reluctant to pay". The Irish Times XXXX Aer Lingus has told pilots at the airline that it will not pay 
incremental increases that were due last month. It is understood that management at the company has told pilots 
that it would not make any adjustment to pay rates pending completion of talks both on dealing with significant 
financial difficulties in their pension scheme and in relation a general review of remuneration which is currently 
under way under the chairmanship of senior counsel Gerry Durcan. The overall cost-containment plan at Aer 
Lingus, known as "Greenfield" ended late last year and it is understood that pilots' representatives argued that the

chief for the International Monetary Fund in Ireland, Mr Chopra told a conference in Dublin that the IMF favoured 
the direct recapitalisation of the banks if necessary. Analysts are growing increasingly concerned that Irish banks 
are going to need even more capital in order to cover losses from the number of mortgages that are either in 
arrears or in default. The Irish Independent XXXX Easyjet confirmed it has agreed to buy 25 slot pairs from Flybe 
for £20m (E23.3m), with the transaction subject to approval from Flybe shareholders. Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary confirmed this week that the airline had submitted a bid to buy the Flybe slots at Gatwick, which is 
Easyjet's biggest base. Ryanair's biggest base is Stansted, and it's about the fourth biggest operator at Gatwick. Mr 
O'Leary said that the Gatwick slots that had been put up for sale were attractive. "We've submitted a bid to Flybe for 
the slots and I think it would be a material opportunity for us there," he said. The Irish Independent

 Ryanair Ltd. (LSE: RYA), the controversial, low-cost Irish carrier run by the colorful and profane Michael O'Leary, 
has run into strong headwinds in Norway, where that country's Prime Minister has made his disdain for the airline 
pointed and personal.
 In support of some Norwegian unions and politicians, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg has vowed that he will never 
fly on Ryanair and called for a boycott over accusations that O'Leary treats his employees like 'slaves,' underpays 
them and maintains poor working conditions.
 The issue came to a head after two female former flight attendants of Ryanair (who are domiciled in Norway) plan 
to sue the company for wrongful termination and for breaching labor laws.
 The women, who were employed by Irish agencies and not directly by the airline, claim that a 'culture of fear' 
predominates at Ryanair and that cabin crews have no job protection, reported EuroNews.
 One of the plaintiffs, an Italian woman named Alessandra, complained that: 'I live in a country [Norway] that is the 
most expensive ever and I have the same payment as a southern [European] country wage, and even they don't 
pay me for sickness.'
 Vegard Einan, a senior official of Parat, the Norwegian civil aviation union that is helping the two women with their 
lawsuit, told local media: "It was a contract of slavery,' according to Agence France Presse.
 Norway's largest labor group, The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO), also said it will support the 
lawsuit against Ryanair.
 'Ryanair has put 'social dumping' into the system, and this lawsuit is of great social significance,' Trine Lise of LO 
told the Norwegian news agency, NTB.
 'It's important for all employees that this form of operation be stopped.'
 ['Social dumping' generally refers to companies using cheaper labor based in other countries.]
 In response, O'Leary jetted to Oslo to deny the accusations. He told reporters at Rygge Airport (where Ryanair has 
a base) he was victimized by 'false claims.'
 'They [the plaintiffs] just invented these false claims some six months after they were dismissed: one for breach of 
safety regulations, and [the other was] dismissed because she wouldn't turn up for work during her 12-month 
probation,' he added.
 He also asserted that his airline observes and satisfies all applicable Irish and European Union labor laws.
 But Ryanair has long endured criticism over its policy of imposing extravagant fees for options like carry-on 
luggage and food -- measures that tend to undermine its stated purpose of providing low-cost air travel. The 
company faces a number of other lawsuits from both customers and ex-employees.
It Seems Norway As A Problem With Low-Cost Airlines, Everywhere
 Along with Prime Minister Stoltenberg, Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Bart Eide has also declared his refusal to 
fly on Ryanair until its labor issues are resolved.
 But the ongoing controversies apparently has not hurt Ryanair's bottom line.
 Earlier this week, the carrier reported that its after-tax profits jumped by 13 percent to €569 million while revenue 
rose by a similar amount to €4.88 billion in its latest fiscal year - all despite higher fuel costs. Passenger traffic also 
climbed by 5 percent to 79.3 million.
 Moreover, Norway's own low-cost carrier, Norwegian Air (OSE: NAS) -- which competes directly with Ryan Air - is 
engulfed in its own problems.
 Norwegian Air is also fighting Norway's labor unions and politicians over plans by the company's chief executive 
Bjørn Kjos to use low-wage Asian crewmembers on Norwegian-registered aircraft - a measure that has been 
scuttled by Oslo officials.
 In response, Kjos said he will register his new Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets in Ireland (where Ryanair is based) -- a 
move that would allow him to hire low-paid Asian staff and thereby circumvent Norwegian laws.
 Kjos has complained that he cannot compete with Asian airlines and others if he must pay his workers Norwegian-
standard salaries.
 'This is our way of living with Norwegian law,' Norwegian Air spokeswomen Anne-Sissel Skånvik told the 
Norwegian newspaper Dagens Næringsliv.
 'We of course must comply with the Norwegian authorities' demand that aircraft with foreign crews must be foreign-
registered. We haven't had any desire to register our aircraft abroad, but this is [because of] the old decision the 
current government has chosen to hang onto.'
 Even a senior Norwegian government official admitted that if Kjos wants to registers aircraft in Ireland, Oslo is 
helpless to prevent it.
 'As long as Norwegian [Air] has a Norwegian AOC [Air Operators Certificate] the company's activities are… subject 
to Norwegian legislation. There is however nothing Norwegian authorities can do to prevent Norwegian [Air] from 
moving its AOC to Ireland or another country,' an official at the Ministry of Transport told The Foreigner newspaper.

EasyJet to pay £20m for Gatwick flight slots

EasyJet is seeking to strengthen its grip on Gatwick by agreeing to pay £20m for take-off and landing slots held by 
Flybe.
EasyJet has overtaken British Airways to become the biggest airline   at the UK's second-largest airport, with an 
estimated 40 per cent market share. These slots should enable the airline to defend itself against encroachment by 
the UK flag carrier, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair.
Europe's second-largest low-cost carrier by revenue, which joined the FTSE 100 in March, plans to use some of the 
Flybe slots to provide additional flights on its most popular routes out of Gatwick, from the summer of 2014.
The proposed transaction - announced yesterday - is consistent with plans by Carolyn McCall, easyJet's chief 
executive, to focus some of the airline's expansion on major airports with limited capacity.
The company is considering placing a large aircraft order soon and Ms McCall said last week that easyJet could 
grow at its top 20 airports at the expense of European flag carriers and other airlines that do not have a low-cost 
business model.
James Hollins, analyst at Investec, said: "This [proposed slot transaction] will . . . enhance easyJet's [market] share 
dominance at Gatwick."
Although Gatwick - in contrast to Heathrow - is not operating at full capacity, it does have operational bottlenecks, 
mainly in the morning. EasyJet should benefit because eight of the 25 pairs of take-off and landing slots it is 
considering are for early morning flights.
Flybe, the lossmaking UK regional airline that has issued several profit warnings since its 2010 flotation, is pulling 
out of Gatwick next April and said it would reinvest some of the £20m of proceeds from the slot sale in its remaining 
159 routes.
EasyJet to pay £20m for Gatwick flight slots
The deal must be approved by Flybe's shareholders, but management decided to sell these Gatwick slots after the 
Civil Aviation Authority, the main aviation regulator, in January rejected the airline's complaint about how the airport 
restructured its charges paid by carriers.
From 2011, Gatwick's summer charges increased by 63 per cent, while winter fees were reduced to zero.
Flybe had complained to the CAA that the changes unreasonably discriminated against it and other operators of 
small aircraft at Gatwick.
Jim French, Flybe's chief executive, said the company could not bear the "punitive rises", particularly when the 
carrier also had to contend with the government's air passenger duty.
Flybe yesterday announced further details of its effort to return its UK business to profit, saying that a planned 
target of £25m of annual cost savings in 2013-14 had been increased to £30m.
It added that the airline had so far cut its workforce by 22 per cent to 2,140 and that further headcount reductions 
would be sought.
The sale of the Gatwick slots, plus other measures, are supposed to finance the turnround plan, including 
redundancies.

Leasing flightcrew, or employing them on short contracts, is not a new phenomenon, but it is growing globally. In 
Europe, there has been recent controversy over the practice for a variety of reasons, just one being the unresolved 
question as to whether this is simply a smart way to avoid paying taxes or social security levies, especially for low-
cost, short-haul carriers such as EasyJet or Ryanair, which have bases and employees in many different European 
states.
The variety of applicable national laws and competing jurisdictions has led to claims by states such as Italy and 
Germany of tax avoidance by airlines and individual pilots. It has also raised the risk that some pilots may be 
targeted for income tax both by the state in which their airline is headquartered and the country in which their 
operational base is situated.
In a recent Ryanair tax controversy, Italian authorities did not like the fact that contracted pilots at the airline's Italian 
bases were paying no tax or social security in the country, and demanded they pay up. This prompted a 
characteristically defiant reaction from Ryanair, which claimed the airline and its employees comply completely with 
their obligations: "All Ryanair pilots and cabin crew operate on Irish-registered aircraft and fully comply with EU tax 
payments and rules. They are paid in Ireland, and pay their taxes and social taxes in Ireland."
Home is where the tax is paid
Ryanair claims the crew's place of work is not Italy but on Irish-registered aircraft which come under Irish territory. 
However, the airline concedes: "Under new [EU] rules introduced in June 2012, new Ryanair recruits will pay their 
social taxes in the country where they start and end their working day, and accordingly will no longer pay their 
social taxes in Ireland. Existing employees will continue, under grandfather rules, to correctly pay their taxes and 
social taxes in Ireland, which fully complies with EU legislation."
IS IT WORKING? The growing internationalisation of the airline industry is creating grey areas when it comes 
to taxation and pilot employment contracts
Those grandfather rules will continue for 10 years. Ryanair adds: "Similar actions against Ryanair in Belgium, 
Germany and Spain have all been unsuccessful, with the courts ruling that Irish jurisdiction applied to Ryanair and 
its crews."
Meanwhile, around the world as a whole, different airlines lease crews for different ­reasons. For example, new 
Asian airlines ­growing fast from a low base have no choice but to hire expatriates because of their instant need for 
large numbers of experienced pilots - mainly captains, trainers and examiners - while the airline usually chooses to 
train its own nationals as first officers to develop its crew base for the future.
The task of finding expatriate pilots, screening them to determine suitability, and helping successful applicants to 
cope with the multifarious problems associated with moving their families to an unfamiliar country, would take 
considerable airline resources, so using specialist recruitment agencies for this task makes sense.
Dallas, Texas-based Flight Crew International (FCI) says this situation is likely to continue in Asia for the 
foreseeable future, and is expected to increase markedly in Africa during the next decade. FCI managing director 
Aasiya Shaikh says her company can provide recruitment alone or recruitment plus resettlement - after which the 
pilot becomes an airline employee - or the agency can become the pilot's permanent employer while he/she works 
for the contracting airline.
Finally, as they always have been, crew leasing agents are the custodians of a pool of pilots who can provide 
airlines with the flexibility to lease in extra crew at peak times and send them back when traffic drops.
Montreal, Canada-based AeroPersonnel Global offers this advice to pilots considering a contract position: "The life 
of the contract pilot is certainly different than the one led by pilots on permanent employment with the same 
employer for many years. It can be a life of adventure, visiting new parts of the world, discovering new cultures, 
making new friends while being well remunerated to do so. But, it is also a life of being away from family and friends 
for months at a time, of adapting to different ­socio­cultural environments, of working under different rules. There is 
also a certain degree of uncertainty when a contract has been completed. Where will the next one take you?"
So much for the description of the contract job from the pilot's point of view. But in addition to the much-vaunted 
seasonal flexibility, what are the advantages for the airline? If a company does not see its human resources (HR) 
department as a core business activity, why not contract it out? Or at least contract out the part of HR that deals 
with pilots and cabin crew. This is particularly true if an airline has many crew bases in different countries, which 
entails dealing with different employment laws, pension issues, taxes and social security requirements in many 
jurisdictions.
Growing trend
The fact more and more airlines are looking into pilot leasing - rather than putting them on payroll - obviously 
interests pilot associations, which are suspicious of it. It is no coincidence that the subject of contracting pilots from 
third-party organisations was a major theme at this year's International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations 
(IFALPA) conference in late April in Dublin. Meanwhile, a recruiting announcement by EasyJet in early 2013, and a 
change in recruiting practice by Norwegian Air Shuttle during the past couple of years, have also sparked a sudden 
wave of anxiety among pilot associations that these carriers might be going down the contracting route - one which 
Ryanair has followed for many years.
Ryanair employs only about 28% of its pilots directly, the rest are on contract, most of them via UK-based agency 
Brookfield. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary tells Flight International's sister magazine Airline Business that 
50% of its captains are on the airline's direct payroll, but about 80% of its "effos" (first officers) are on contracts, 
although the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association puts those respective figures nearer to 60% of captains (on Ryanair 
payroll) and about 95% of co-pilots (on contract).
The Ryanair contract model has also developed over the past few years. Before 2009, Brookfield would carry out 
the recruiting and contract pilots to the airline. Since then, Brookfield has developed a model that requires the pilots 
IS IT WORKING? The growing internationalisation of the airline industry is creating grey areas when it comes 
to taxation and pilot employment contracts
to be self-employed and then, with the agency acting as a management go-between, sign a contract bonding them 
to fly exclusively for Ryanair.
The airline pays for scheduled block duty at a rate of E140 ($180) per hour. But these pilots have to pay for all their 
own expenses, including uniforms, identity cards, transport and hotel accommodation, and claim these against tax. 
If they are told to move base, they have to pay for the relocation, although positioning seats can be allocated on 
Ryanair flights if there are any available.
The contracted pilots have no pension scheme or insurance unless they set one up themselves. Their income tax is 
paid in Ireland, but if they are based overseas, O'Leary says they are entitled to claim back the Irish tax and then 
pay tax in their base country, but that, he says, is up to them to arrange.
This relieves Ryanair of certain HR responsibilities, which are dealt with by Brookfield and the pilots themselves as 
directors of their own companies. However, when asked what really appeals to him about the arrangement, O'Leary 
says first that it makes it impossible for the pilot unions to have any influence over the Ryanair contract pilots, and 
second, that it gives Ryanair far more workforce flexibility than a settled, unionised labour force would ever allow in 
practice. The contract the pilots sign with Ryanair via Brookfield is non-negotiable and binds them exclusively to fly 
for Ryanair unless they get advance permission to do otherwise, and it requires that they will, if requested, relocate 
to another base for part of each year to cope with seasonal variations in demand, or adjust to changed or new 
market decisions by the airline.
CREW FLEXIBILITY
An example of quick-reaction market flexibility emerged in a conversation about contracting with O'Leary. Ryanair's 
biggest single base, London Stansted airport, had just announced a 6% rise in its user charges. The airline argued 
this was unjustifiable, so it is withdrawing three aircraft and redeploying them and appropriate numbers of crew to 
other bases in Spain, Germany and Italy.
That level of crew flexibility is available under the contract arrangements, O'Leary says, adding the proviso that he 
"does not mess them around too much or they leave". Rosters are published 30 days in advance and adhere to 
European flight-time limitations, and O'Leary claims that those required to shift base seasonally for part of the year 
are ­normally notified well in advance, so there is at least a degree of predictability about the contract pilots' working 
lives. IFALPA claims that in reality, life for some pilots entails rather more sudden requirements to move, which the 
Brookfield contract permits.
Meanwhile, choosing to leave or being dismissed requires three months' notice by the appropriate party, but there 
is an interesting factor built into the contracts which could make the arrangement rather one-sided if it were to be 
exercised. If the airline wanted to get rid of a contract pilot, Brookfield could issue the three-month notice of 
termination. But when the pilot checked his roster, he could theoretically find he had been allocated no hours, 
because there is no stipulation in the contract that specifies a guaranteed minimum number of hours. This is a 
powerful incentive for pilots to stay in line. Brookfield was approached repeatedly to talk about the contract pilot 
industry, but continually failed to respond to requests for an interview.
ROAD'S END
There are particular groups of pilots, says O'Leary, for whom the high-hours, highly-paid life of the Ryanair contract 
pilot is attractive. Many of these are Americans, he notes, and if they fly high hours, they can chalk up the 900h 
annual maximum allowable under European rules within nine months, earning E126,000 before tax and expenses, 
then take three months off to do something else.
O'Leary does not deny that he expects most of his pilots to fly the maximum allowable flight time under European 
regulations, which is 900h in a calendar year. Ryanair's calendar year for rostering purposes starts on 1 April, on 
which date accumulated flight hours for all pilots are administratively zeroed.
IS IT WORKING? The growing internationalisation of the airline industry is creating grey areas when it comes 
to taxation and pilot employment contracts
The Irish Airline Pilots Association says it knows of specific cases, however, when pilots have exceeded the 900h 
limit as calculated on a rolling 12-month basis in up to nine of the months in both of the past two years. Asked about 
this, the Irish Aviation Authority says this is permitted providing the 1 April-31 March period records a 900h 
maximum, and the 12-month total assessed on a rolling basis at any point in the year remains within 1,000h. 
Ryanair says it complies with this.
EasyJet and Norwegian recently appeared to be preparing to go down a similar road, upsetting pilot unions and 
unsettling some already confused government labour departments and tax authorities. And now Norwegian has 
thrown a hand grenade into the middle of this discussion by examining the possibility of contracting Asian cabin 
crew and possibly pilots for new long-haul routes.
Unions and governments are both viewing this askance on the grounds that aviation could go the way of the 
merchant marine world, where seamans' jobs are parcelled out to low-wage economies.
Jack Netskar, of the Norwegian Air Line Pilots Association (NALPA), thinks this possibility has been advanced by 
the airline, and it is currently being reviewed by the country's ministry of labour, which is not pleased about it.
When Norwegian was started up it hired its pilots directly, but two or three years ago, says NALPA, it started 
recruiting pilots exclusively through the self-employed Brookfield model.
Pilot union worries over EasyJet were prompted by a recent announcement the airline was recruiting 330 pilots 
through its ab initio crew supply agreement with CTC and Parc, the partner flightcrew training organisation and crew 
leasing agency.
EasyJet says that for two years after graduating from training, its candidate pilots are employed by CTC/Parc on a 
salary, and contracted to EasyJet as junior first officers. This confers some seasonal flexibility on the airline, says 
EasyJet communications chief Paul Moore. However, Moore says the young pilots are guaranteed some off-season 
work, even if it is a reduced amount compared with the summer. Following two years gaining experience on the 
line, Moore explains that "the vast majority" of the pilots will become senior first officers and move on to the airline's 
payroll, with the prospect, he says, of a salary as high as £146,000 ($226,500) for a training captain.
However, the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) describes the situation differently: "In truth, 330 pilots 
currently flying on a casual basis for EasyJet are to be offered a permanent contract which, after debt repayments, 
will leave them bringing home less than they might earn by working in a bar."
EVOLVING TRENDS
This is an arrangement the company has operated on for some time, says Moore, and the only reason for the 
announcement of a sudden intake of 330 pilots under the scheme, was that negotiations with BALPA over 
employment arrangements had taken such a long time a backlog of recruitment demand had built up.
BALPA sent a letter to EasyJet chairman Sir Michael Rake warning him - though pleading with him might be a 
better description - not to go down the Ryanair contract path. EasyJet has always recognised pilot unions, and 
Moore says the airline does not intend to change that.
"We are not like Ryanair towards our pilots, and we never will be," he says. The EasyJet policy, he explains, is that 
it employs the majority of its pilots directly, with a total of about 10% from leasing agencies. And their pilots pay 
income and social taxes in the country in which they are based.
The global airline marketplace is evolving so fast it is not easy to predict what the new employment trends will be, 
but the investigation sparked by Norwegian's move to hire crew from low-wage economies may be worth keeping 
an eye on.

Even with normal employment contracts, airline pilots have a different relationship with their employer than, say, 
office or factory workers.
The latter report to the same place each day and might actually meet and talk to their management. Pilots, 
however, interact with their airline increasingly through a laptop or tablet for all the information they need: personal 
roster, company and chief pilot's diktats, and aeronautical information for the flight they are about to crew. At base 
they leave their cars in the operations block car park and breeze through "ops" for the sole purpose of meeting up 
with the other pilot and the cabin crew. Then it's out to the aeroplane, and off they go for a multi-sector day, or a 
week in hotels.
That's already an arm's-length relationship. But if, as the airline, you require your pilots to be self-employed and to 
look after duty expenses and tax affairs, the relationship is more than distant - it's out of sight.
Does that matter? Where the company shows no loyalty to its workers it cannot expect any in return, so the only 
human resources tool, since pecuniary rewards only come from high hours, is the disciplinary stick.
Does that matter? The system has been working at Ryanair, is increasingly being adopted by Norwegian Air Shuttle 
and is an idea that may spread. The danger is that if the model goes wrong it would affect safety, but the industry 
will not find that out until too late.

RYANAIR is massive in Poland.
One of the many mildly interesting facts to emerge from the airline's results presentation is that Ryanair has leap-
frogged flag carrier Lot, which has been forced to take an EU rescue loan, to become the country's first choice in 
aviation. It's a pattern that is repeating across Ryanair's European heartland.
Ryanair says it is in talks with 75 airports about increasing flight frequency, and from Germany to Greece it sees 
opportunities to seize market share from struggling rivals.
Deputy chief executive Howard Miller, tongue firmly in cheek, said yesterday that Ryanair caters for the "poor and 
oppressed", picking up traffic among economic migrants shuttling back and forth between home and work nations.
Its focus on the cheap end of the market still has plenty of space to grow, despite Ryanair's note of caution about 
the European economy that several analysts said was overly modest. The International Air Transport Association 
expects traffic in Europe to rise four per cent a year until 2016. And even in the UK, where cost-conscious flyers 
already use budget carriers for an estimated 58 per cent of intra-European flights, Ryanair continues to gain 
passengers.
Ryanair's policy of charging its customers for everything from beer to baggage might not win any devoted followers 
of its brand philosophy, but its dogged approach to ancillaries gives it market-leading margins.
The firm boasts that it has returned more than £1bn to investors since 2007. With another special dividend possible 
in 2015, Ryanair's shares look set to ascend alongside its ever-busier Polish planes.

precisely, it worked out at EUR48, up 6 per cent year on year - or perhaps a little more on an underlying basis since 
that includes bag charges, and fliers are finally wising up to the weighty additional costs that luggage entails. 
Passenger numbers grew 5 per cent , which the low-cost carrier thinks will moderate to 3 per cent in 2013-14. It 
also forecasts net profits of EUR570m-EUR600m for the current year. At the top end, that implies a 5 per cent 
increase from 2012-13's EUR570m.
Yet, in contrast to these seemingly modest growth numbers, Ryanair shares have risen 80 per cent over the past 12 
months, way above the one-third increase in the Euro Stoxx index. That leaves an obvious question for investors: 
how much upside remains?
In terms of the immediate future, Ryanair has been cautious so often that the market tends to look well beyond 
management's own forecasts. After all, a year ago, the airline talked of 2012-13 net profits of EUR400m-EUR440m, 
and the actual out-turn was 30 per cent higher. Moreover, on the sales front, even management expects that 
ancillary revenues - now almost a quarter of the total and including reserved seating fees - will grow 9 per cent in 
2013-14. Ryanair also plans to ground fewer aircraft this winter (60 versus 80). Cost controls, meanwhile, remain 
exemplary, with a per-passenger figure (excluding fuel) of EUR29, or half that at rival easyJet. Fuel, too, is 
moderating.
Longer-term, the general capacity discipline on intra-Europe flights at present, coupled with airline consolidation, 
throws up expansion opportunities which Ryanair has a solid record of seizing. So net profits of EUR630m-
EUR635m in 2013-14, say, would imply a 15 times earnings multiple. That is pricier than the airline's seats, but not 
excessive.

THE FTSE 100 index of Britain's biggest blue chip companies rallied to a 13-year high yesterday, underscoring a 
rebirth of confidence for City bankers and stock pickers.
Bullish investors pushed the index up to close at 6,755.63 points - its highest closing level since September 2000.
One capital markets banker told City A.M. yesterday: "The good times are back."
The closely watched share index, which mirrors how popular stocks are, is now poised to take on its December 
1999 record of 6,930 points, as investors take their cue from good company balance sheets to pile into shares.
"It's been an incredible run and a lot of it is justified with the profit growth we have seen," Legal and General 
Investment Management's stock picking expert Lars Kreckel told City A.M..
"Global equities are up 100 per cent since 2009; if that's not a bull market it's difficult to know what is."
Yesterday's climb was led by a 4.5 per cent surge in taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland shares, following an 
upgrade from a leading market analyst.
Airline EasyJet also took off after solid profits from rival Ryanair pushed investors to back airline stocks.
London's surge comes amid a broader global equity market rally that has added an estimated $2.3 trillion to the 
total market cap of listed companies around the world in the last month alone.
RETURN OF THE BULLS London's blue chip index reaches its highest level for thirteen years as gold and 
silver prices lose their lustre
Yesterday the index of the biggest 600 companies in Europe - the Stoxx Europe 600 - made further gains, putting it 
at the highest level since June 2008.
Others indices, like Germany's blue chip Dax index, breached its July 2007 record earlier this month to close at an 
all time high.
The bullish stock sentiment has caused other assets like precious metals to come off the pace in recent weeks as 
investors swing into stocks.
Yesterday gold and silver prices - which have already fallen 17 per cent and 25 per cent respectively this year - slid 
to fresh lows before reversing at midday to close slightly higher. Silver plunged to its lowest price in two and a half 
years before switching tack at midday to end up one per cent.
Gold finished up two per cent, reversing over a week of daily trading losses.
Increasing market liquidity, led by central banks' massive money printing operations, has helped cut the 
attractiveness of both gold and bonds yields, forcing investors to rotate into higher yielding equities.
Coupled with strong dividend yields paid out by cautious management teams - the FTSE has returned 54.32 per 
cent to investors since its last September 2000 peak if dividends are included - and market watchers predict the bull 
run will continue. "We do not believe the market is overextended at this time," Morgan Stanley Euorpean equity 
strategist Graham Secker said in a note yesterday.
"We believe the market has further upside. Although some measures of investor sentiment now appear quite 
elevated, we are not unduly concerned."
However, macro research outfit Capital Economics yesterday sounded a note of caution, forecasting about a 10 per 
cent fall in UK and US equity markets and a 15 per cent dip in European and Japanese equities.
"We continue to expect a substantial correction in equity prices in the second half of the year," it said.
"Assuming global monetary policy remains loose and Europe emerges stronger, the markets should then perk up 
again in 2014. But we doubt the current euphoria will last throughout 2013."
Last night the US S&P 500 -which has gained 17 per cent since the start of the year - finished the session down 
0.07 per cent at 1,666.29.
The index has repeatedly broken records over the past two weeks, hitting record highs on ten of the last 12 trading 
days.

Ryanair is aiming to achieve further growth at the expense of European flag carriers in the next five years, as it 
announced a 16 per cent increase in underlying operating profit for 2012-13.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue announced it would use a planned purchase of 175 Boeing passenger 
jets to expand in Germany, Scandinavia and central Europe, and told investors that a third special dividend could 
be paid in 2014-15.
Howard Millar, Ryanair's finance director, said the company would continue to expand on European short-haul 
routes while rivals - including Iberia, Air France, Lufthansa, Air Berlin, LOT Polish Airlines and SAS - were engaged 
in restructurings that involved capacity cuts.
Mr Millar predicted that Ryanair would increase its addressable market share of European short-haul passengers 
from 15 per cent now to 20 per cent by 2018-19, saying it could replace Air Berlin as the second-largest carrier in 
Germany.
He added that Ryanair would look at all growth opportunities, including flying migrant workers from Bulgaria and 
Romania to other parts of the EU, when workers from these two countries secured full employment rights in 
member states next year.
"Our growth in Poland has been driven [by] migrant workers going back and forth [to their home country]," he said.
Ryanair paid a maiden special dividend worth EUR500m in 2010, with a second distributed last year, and Mr Millar 
said a further payment to shareholders was possible in 2014-15. The company's shares closed up almost 7 per 
cent at EUR6.75.
Like easyJet, Ryanair has benefited from consumers turning from European flag carriers to budget airlines in the 
economic downturn.
Ryanair sets flight path to growth TRAVEL & LEISURE
Ryanair reported revenue of EUR4.9bn for the year to March 31, up 11 per cent on the previous year, as the 
number of passengers carried by the Irish airline rose 5 per cent to 79.3m.
The company's average fare increased 6 per cent to EUR48, while ancillary revenue - charges beyond the basic 
flight ticket - climbed 20 per cent to EUR1.1bn. This was partly driven by Ryanair giving passengers the opportunity 
to reserve their seats for an additional fee.
Operating profit - excluding one-off items that boosted earnings in 2011-12 - increased by 16 per cent to 
EUR718.2m. Net income rose 2 per cent to EUR569.3m.
Ryanair expects to report net income of EUR570m to EUR600m for 2013-14, partly because of higher costs 
involving fuel and airport charges. But analysts noted that the company has a habit of issuing conservative 
guidance.
Mr Millar confirmed Ryanair would continue court appeals against the European Commission's prohibition in 
February of its proposed takeover of Aer Lingus , and a UK regulatory in-quiry into its 30 per cent stake in the Irish 
flag -carrier.

BRITAIN'S benchmark equity index rose yesterday to its best closing level since late 2000, helped by rising bank 
stocks, and analysts said there was little holding it back from its all-time highs.
Interest rate cuts and injections of liquidity by central banks have hit returns on bonds, driving investors to seek the 
better returns on offer from equities, spurring a global stock market rally over the last year.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed up by 0.5 per cent, or 32.57 points, at 6,755.63 points - its highest closing 
level since September 2000.
Germany's DAX and the US Dow Jones Industrial Average have already hit record highs this year, and IG analyst 
Brenda Kelly said the next target for the FTSE 100 could be its record intraday peak of 6,950.60 points in 
December 1999.
Securequity sales trader Jawaid Afsar also said there was little to hold back the FTSE.
"It's grinding higher, and there's no real selling pressure. Everyone keeps trying to call the top of the market but any 
wobble is another occasion to buy into it. The momentum is still bullish," said Afsar.
Part-nationalised lender Royal Bank of Scotland led the FTSE leaderboard with a 4.5 per cent gain, which traders 
attributed to an upgrade on the stock by broker Numis.
RBS's rise enabled the UK banking sector to advance 0.9 per cent, which gave one of the biggest lifts to the FTSE 
100 which has risen 14.5 per cent since the start of 2013.
RBS leads FTSE as bank shares continue rising LONDON REPORT
EGR Broking managing director Kyri Kangellaris said some investors may look to sell equities in order to book 
profits on the rally so far this year at the 6,850 point mark - a level at which the FTSE hit a high in 1999 before then 
falling sharply as the Internet bubble burst at the start of 2000.
"I still think people should look to take profits," he said.
Meanwhile European shares reached new five-year peaks yesterday, supported by strength in the autos and travel 
sector, where budget airline Ryanair's stock hit a record high on the back of strong earnings.
Travel and leisure stocks gained 1.1 per cent, led by a 6.9 per cent jump in Ryanair after it reported 
expectationbeating earnings for the past year. The pan-European FTSEUROFIRST 300 closed 0.3 per cent higher 
at 1,252.09, its highest close since June 2008. Trading was quiet because stock markets in Switzerland, Austria, 
Denmark and Norway were shut for a holiday.
Car makers were the biggest sectoral gainers. They rose 2.3 per cent to take gains since Friday to 5.3 per cent, 
when the European car market snapped an 18-month streak of contraction. Car makers such as Volkswagen BMW 
and Daimler joined airline Lufthansa as the strongest gainers on the DAX.

European shares moved higher, aided by strong results from Ryanair .
More income from optional charges such as checked baggage lifted the Irish budget carrier's net profit 13 per cent 
to EUR569m, beating forecasts.
The shares rose 6.9 per cent to EUR6.77 for the second biggest rise on the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index.
The results saw the sector gain as well - Lufthansa added 3.6 per cent to EUR16.07 and Air France-KLM rose 4

BUDGET carrier Ryanair's expansion throughout Europe has delivered a 13 per cent rise in annual profits.
Ryanair yesterday posted record post-tax profits of (EURO)569m (£480.7m), on revenues up 13 per cent to 
(EURO)4.88bn.
The rise in earnings outstripped a five per cent lift in passenger numbers to 79.3m. Ryanair's ancillary revenues 
from baggage charges and reserved seating soared 20 per cent to (EURO)1.06bn in the year, now making up 22 
per cent of revenue.
Ryanair, which has historically underestimated its performance in forecasts, gave a "cautious" prediction of three 
per cent traffic growth and a five per cent rise in profits in the coming year.
The company aims to increase its traffic to 100m passengers a year by 2019, as it puts new planes into circulation.
Deputy chief executive Howard Miller said Ryanair will bid for regional carrier Flybe's 25 take-off and landing slots 
at Gatwick, but that Stansted remains its priority. "We would prefer, if there's going to be another runway built, [for 
it] to be at Stansted," he said.
But he said Ryanair is "not particularly" keen on Stansted becoming Britain's hub airport, as it "doesn't actively seek 
connecting traffic".

The appeal of contracting flightcrew has prompted tax controversy and fears that jobs will go to low-wage 
economies in the same way as the merchant marine
Leasing flightcrew, or employing them on short contracts, is not a new phenomenon, but it is growing globally. In 
Europe, there has been recent controversy over the practice for a variety of reasons, just one being the unresolved 
question as to whether this is simply a smart way to avoid paying taxes or social security levies, especially for low-
cost, short-haul carriers such as EasyJet or Ryanair, which have bases and employees in many different European 
states.
The variety of applicable national laws and competing jurisdictions has led to claims by states such as Italy and 
Germany of tax avoidance by airlines and individual pilots. It has also raised the risk that some pilots may be 
targeted for income tax both by the state in which their airline is headquartered and the state in which their 
operational base is situated.
In the recent Ryanair tax controversy, Italian authorities did not like the fact that contracted pilots at the airline's 
Italian bases were paying no tax or social security in the country, and demanded they pay up. This prompted a 
characteristically defiant reaction from Ryanair, which claimed the airline and its employees comply completely with 
their obligations: "All Ryanair pilots and cabin crew operate on Irish-registered aircraft and fully comply with EU tax 
payments and rules. They are paid in Ireland, and pay their taxes and social taxes in Ireland."
HOME IS WHERE THE TAX IS PAID
Ryanair claims the crew's place of work is not Italy but on Irish-registered aircraft which come under Irish territory. 
However, the airline concedes: "Under new [EU] rules introduced in June 2012, new Ryanair recruits will pay their 
social taxes in the country where they start and end their working day, and accordingly will no longer pay their 
social taxes in Ireland. Existing employees will continue, under grandfather rules, to correctly pay their taxes and 
social taxes in Ireland, which fully complies with EU legislation."
No Headline In Original
Those grandfather rules will continue for 10 years. Ryanair adds: "Similar actions against Ryanair in Belgium, 
Germany and Spain have all been unsuccessful, with the courts ruling that Irish jurisdiction applied to Ryanair and 
its crews." Meanwhile, around the world as a whole, different airlines lease crews for different reasons. For 
example, new Asian airlines growing fast from a low base have no choice but to hire expatriates because of their 
instant need for large numbers of experienced pilots - mainly captains, trainers and examiners - while the airline 
usually chooses to train its own nationals as first officers to develop its crew base for the future.
The task of finding expatriate pilots, screening them to determine suitability, and helping successful applicants to 
cope with the multifarious problems associated with moving their families to an unfamiliar country, would take 
considerable airline resources, so using specialist recruitment agencies for this task makes sense.
Dallas, Texas-based Flight Crew International (FCI) says this situation is likely to continue in Asia for the 
foreseeable future, and is expected to increase markedly in Africa during the next decade. FCI managing director 
Aasiya Shaikh says her company can provide recruitment alone or recruitment plus resettlement - after which the 
pilot becomes an airline employee - or the agency can become the pilot's permanent employer while he/she works 
for the contracting airline.
Finally, as they always have been, crew leasing agents are the custodians of a pool of pilots who can provide 
airlines with the flexibility to lease in extra crew at peak times and send them back when traffic drops.
Montreal, Canada-based AeroPersonnel Global offers this advice to pilots considering a contract position: "The life 
of the contract pilot is certainly different than the one led by pilots on permanent employment with the same 
employer for many years. It can be a life of adventure, visiting new parts of the world, discovering new cultures, 
making new friends while being well remunerated to do so. But, it is also a life of being away from family and friends 
for months at a time, of adapting to different socio-cultural environments, of working under different rules. There is 
also a certain degree of uncertainty when a contract has been completed. Where will the next one take you?"
So much for the description of the contract job from the pilot's point of view. But in addition to the much-vaunted 
seasonal flexibility, what are the advantages for the airline? If a company does not see its human resources (HR) 
department as a core business activity, why not contract it out? Or at least contract out the part of HR that deals 
with pilots and cabin crew. This is particularly true if an airline has many crew bases in different countries, which 
entails dealing with different employment laws, pension issues, taxes and social security requirements in many 
jurisdictions.
GROWING TREND
The fact more and more airlines are looking into pilot leasing - rather than putting them on payroll - obviously 
interests pilot associations, which are suspicious of it. It is no coincidence that the subject of contracting pilots from 
third-party organisations was a major theme at this year's International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations 
(IFALPA) conference in late April in Dublin. Meanwhile, a recruiting announcement by EasyJet in early 2013, and a 
change in recruiting practice by Norwegian Air Shuttle during the past couple of years, have also sparked a sudden 
wave of anxiety among pilot associations that these carriers might be going down the contracting route - one which 
Ryanair has followed for many years.
Ryanair employs only about 28% of its pilots directly, the rest are on contract, most of them via UK-based agency 
Brookfield. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary tells Flight International's sister magazine Airline Business that 
50% of its captains are on the airline's direct payroll, but about 80% of its "effos" (first officers) are on contracts, 
although the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association puts those respective figures nearer to 60% of captains (on Ryanair 
payroll) and about 95% of co-pilots (on contract).
The Ryanair contract model has also developed over the past few years. Before 2009, Brookfield would carry out 
the recruiting and contract pilots to the airline. Since then, Brookfield has developed a model that requires the pilots 
to be self-employed and then, with the agency acting as a management go-between, sign a contract bonding them 
to fly exclusively for Ryanair.
No Headline In Original
The airline pays for scheduled block duty at a rate of E140 ($180) per hour. But these pilots have to pay for all their 
own expenses, including uniforms, identity cards, transport and hotel accommodation, and claim these against tax. 
If they are told to move base, they have to pay for the relocation, although positioning seats can be allocated on 
Ryanair flights if there are any available.
The contracted pilots have no pension scheme or insurance unless they set one up themselves. Their income tax is 
paid in Ireland, but if they are based overseas, O'Leary says they are entitled to claim back the Irish tax and then 
pay tax in their base country, but that, he says, is up to them to arrange.
This relieves Ryanair of certain HR responsibilities, which are dealt with by Brookfield and the pilots themselves as 
directors of their own companies. However, when asked what really appeals to him about the arrangement, O'Leary 
says first that it makes it impossible for the pilot unions to have any influence over the Ryanair contract pilots, and 
second, that it gives Ryanair far more workforce flexibility than a settled, unionised labour force would ever allow in 
practice. The contract the pilots sign with Ryanair via Brookfield is non-negotiable and binds them exclusively to fly 
for Ryanair unless they get advance permission to do otherwise, and it requires that they will, if requested, relocate 
to another base for part of each year to cope with seasonal variations in demand, or adjust to changed or new 
market decisions by the airline.
CREW FLEXIBILITY
An example of quick-reaction market flexibility emerged in a conversation about contracting with O'Leary. Ryanair's 
biggest single base, London Stansted airport, had just announced a 6% rise in its user charges. The airline argued 
this was unjustifiable, so it is withdrawing three aircraft and redeploying them and appropriate numbers of crew to 
other bases in Spain, Germany and Italy.
That level of crew flexibility is available under the contract arrangements, O'Leary says, adding the proviso that he 
"does not mess them around too much or they leave". Rosters are published 30 days in advance and adhere to 
European flight-time limitations, and O'Leary claims that those required to shift base seasonally for part of the year 
are normally notified well in advance, so there is at least a degree of predictability about the contract pilots' working 
lives. IFALPA claims that in reality, life for some pilots entails rather more sudden requirements to move, which the 
Brookfield contract permits.
Meanwhile, choosing to leave or being dismissed requires three months' notice by the appropriate party, but there 
is an interesting factor built into the contracts which could make the arrangement rather one-sided if it were to be 
exercised. If the airline wanted to get rid of a contract pilot, Brookfield could issue the three-month notice of 
termination. But when the pilot checked his roster, he could theoretically find he had been allocated no hours, 
because there is no stipulation in the contract that specifies a guaranteed minimum number of hours. This is a 
powerful incentive for pilots to stay in line. Brookfield was approached repeatedly to talk about the contract pilot 
industry, but continually failed to respond to requests for an interview.
ROAD'S END
There are particular groups of pilots, says O'Leary, for whom the high-hours, highly-paid life of the Ryanair contract 
pilot is attractive. Many of these are Americans, he notes, and if they fly high hours, they can chalk up the 900h 
annual maximum allowable under European rules within nine months, earning E126,000 before tax and expenses, 
then take three months off to do something else.
O'Leary does not deny that he expects most of his pilots to fly the maximum allowable flight time under European 
regulations, which is 900h in a calendar year. Ryanair's calendar year for rostering purposes starts on 1 April, on 
which date accumulated flight hours for all pilots are administratively zeroed.
The Irish Airline Pilots Association says it knows of specific cases, however, when pilots have exceeded the 900h 
limit as calculated on a rolling 12-month basis in up to nine of the months in both of the past two years. Asked about 
this, the Irish Aviation Authority says this is permitted providing the 1 April-31 March period records a 900h 
No Headline In Original
maximum, and the 12-month total assessed on a rolling basis at any point in the year remains within 1,000h. 
Ryanair says it complies with this.
EasyJet and Norwegian recently appeared to be preparing to go down a similar road, upsetting pilot unions and 
unsettling some already confused government labour departments and tax authorities. And now Norwegian has 
thrown a hand grenade into the middle of this discussion by examining the possibility of contracting Asian cabin 
crew and possibly pilots for new long-haul routes.
Unions and governments are both viewing this askance on the grounds that aviation could go the way of the 
merchant marine world, where seamans' jobs are parcelled out to low-wage economies.
Jack Netskar, of the Norwegian Air Line Pilots Association (NALPA), thinks this possibility has been advanced by 
the airline, and it is currently being reviewed by the country's ministry of labour, which is not pleased about it.
When Norwegian was started up it hired its pilots directly, but two or three years ago, says NALPA, it started 
recruiting pilots exclusively through the self-employed Brookfield model.
Pilot union worries over EasyJet were prompted by a recent announcement the airline was recruiting 330 pilots 
through its ab initio crew supply agreement with CTC and Parc, the partner flightcrew training organisation and crew 
leasing agency.
EasyJet says that for two years after graduating from training, its candidate pilots are employed by CTC/Parc on a 
salary, and contracted to EasyJet as junior first officers. This confers some seasonal flexibility on the airline, says 
EasyJet communications chief Paul Moore. However, Moore says the young pilots are guaranteed some off-season 
work, even if it is a reduced amount compared with the summer. Following two years gaining experience on the 
line, Moore explains that "the vast majority" of the pilots will become senior first officers and move on to the airline's 
payroll, with the prospect, he says, of a salary as high as £146,000 ($226,500) for a training captain.
However, the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) describes the situation differently: "In truth, 330 pilots 
currently flying on a casual basis for EasyJet are to be offered a permanent contract which, after debt repayments, 
will leave them bringing home less than they might earn by working in a bar."
EVOLVING TRENDS
This is an arrangement the company has operated on for some time, says Moore, and the only reason for the 
announcement of a sudden intake of 330 pilots under the scheme, was that negotiations with BALPA over 
employment arrangements had taken such a long time a backlog of recruitment demand had built up.
BALPA sent a letter to EasyJet chairman Sir Michael Rake warning him - though pleading with him might be a 
better description - not to go down the Ryanair contract path. EasyJet has always recognised pilot unions, and 
Moore says the airline does not intend to change that.
"We are not like Ryanair towards our pilots, and we never will be," he says. The EasyJet policy, he explains, is that 
it employs the majority of its pilots directly, with a total of about 10% from leasing agencies. And their pilots pay 
income and social taxes in the country in which they are based.
The global airline marketplace is evolving so fast it is not easy to predict what the new employment trends will be, 
but the investigation sparked by Norwegian's move to hire crew from low-wage economies may be worth keeping 
an eye on.

If READERS were worried that City bosses occasionally took themselves too seriously, for reassurance that they 
don't, look no further than the official statement from blogging site Tumblr yesterday.
After announcing it had been acquired by internet company Yahoo! - Tumblr boss David Karp wrote: "Before 
touching on how awesome this is, let me try to allay any concerns. We're not turning purple. Our headquarters isn't 
moving."
He added: "Marissa and her team share our dream to make the internet the ultimate creative canvas. Plus both our 
logos end with punctuation!" The corporate missive was then neatly signed off: "F**k yeah, David."
Karp is not the only one to use such a punchy corporate sign-off. At the end of last year Irish airline Ryanair 
announced that the firm's head of communications Stephen McNamara was to resign and in an official press 
release Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said that the firm would look forward to "grooming the next candidate to take 
over the high profile and incredibly overpaid position." Good to know that a healthy dose of irony is still alive and 
kicking in the City.

Ryanair reported record profits Monday as Europe's largest budget airline expanded its route network across the 
continent and into North Africa.
Ryanair's share price also surged to an all-time high after the Dublin-based carrier predicted it would enjoy similar, if 
not better, earnings in the coming year.
The company's net profit in the 12 months through March rose 13 percent to 569.3 million euros ($729 million), 
eclipsing last year's record. The airline, famous for its extra charges on everything from boarding cards to assigned 
seats, has thrived against higher-cost rivals amid recession and the eurozone debt crisis.
Sales rose 13 percent to 4.9 billion euros for the fiscal year ending in March. This reflects a 6 percent rise in 
average ticket prices and 217 new routes, taking Ryanair's network to more than 1,600. During the year, Ryanair 
opened up new bases in Croatia, Greece, Morocco, the Netherlands and Poland.
Ryanair carried 79.3 million passengers, up 5 percent, and continued to sell on average 82 percent of its seats. It 
expects to carry 81.5 million customers in the 2013-14 fiscal year.
Shares in Ryanair surged nearly 10 percent on the better-than-expected profits, and closed the day up 7 percent at 
6.77 euros. Ryanair shares a year ago were trading near 4 euros.
Analysts welcomed confirmation that Ryanair has secured 90 percent of its 2013-14 fuel needs at an average cost 
of $98 per barrel, close to the current market price.
Fuel represents Ryanair's biggest expense and, if not hedged against, is its most unpredictable threat to future 
profitability. Ryanair said its fuel costs rose 18 percent in 2012-13 to 1.89 billion euros, or 45 percent of total 
company expenses.
Ryanair offered an upbeat outlook, predicting a further increase in its net profits over the next 12 months despite 
recession across much of Europe. It forecast a profit in the range of 570 million euros to 600 million euros for the 
year ending in March 2014, making it far and away the best-performing airline in Europe.
Ryanair keeps growing, reports record profits
Its network is expected to keep growing as quickly as its fleet of Boeing 737-800s expands. Ryanair already 
operates 305 aircraft, and in March ordered 175 more 737-800s to be delivered from 2014 to 2018.
"Our new-route teams continue to handle more growth opportunities than our current fleet expansion allows.  
Significant opportunities are opening up in Germany, Scandinavia and central Europe in particular, where Air Berlin, 
SAS and LOT continue to restructure," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.

It has been quite a morning for the ISEQ which is currently at 4,055, up 51 points as European markets are solid 
and Ryanair soars into the sky.
AIB Treasury brings us back to earth with a summary of how they see things:
The dollar defied conventional market logic last week by making
further gains, despite a lot of poor US data releases. Comments by a number of Fed officials indicating that its asset 
purchase programme may soon start to be scaled back, saw the dollar continue to make ground. It hit a three year 
high on a trade weighted basis on Friday. The markets took particular note of comments by John Williams, 
President of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, and a strong supporter of asset purchases. He indicated that the 
Fed could start scaling back the programme this summer and exit it completely by the end of the year. The future 
direction of US monetary policy is now the key driver of forex markets. Thus, all eyes will be on the Fed Chairman, 
Ben Bernanke, and his testimony to Congress on Wednesday to see what guidance he gives on the Fed's asset 
buying programme. The markets are seeking clarity in this regard. Thus, they will also focus on the minutes of the 
last FOMC meeting, which are also out on Wednesday. Attention will also focus on the minutes of the May MPC 
meeting in the UK, which are also due Wednesday, to see if support for further QE has waned. The BoJ meets 
tomorrow but no policy change is expected. Weekend comments by the Japanese Economy Minister that the yen's 
excessive strength had largely been corrected saw the currency rise off four and a half year lows against the dollar 
after it hit 103.32 on Friday according to AIB Treasury.

Ryanair posted forecast-beating full-year earnings today, buoyed by strong growth in fares and a sharp rise in 
charges for items such as baggage and in-flight refreshments.
Shares in Europe's largest budget airline jumped more than 6 percent to a record high of 6.764 euros.
The company warned profit growth may slow sharply in the coming 12 months as it waits for new plane deliveries 
and margins are squeezed by higher fuel costs and cash-strapped consumers.
Yet its cautious outlook was offset by a strong performance in the past year, buoyed by a 6 percent increase in 
average fares as capacity growth in Europe stalled, while non-ticket income from extras such as baggage and 
reserved seating, which account for around one-fifth of revenue, was up by 20 percent. Net profit reached 569 
million euros (dollar 730 million) in the 12 months to the end of March, up 13 percent and ahead of an average 
analyst forecast of 558 million in a company poll. Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar said the company 
was making a cautious forecast for the current year due to poor visibility on bookings in the second half of the year. 
"We are extraordinarily modest at the start of the year," he said. The group warned that profit growth could stall in 
the year ahead, seeing profit at between 570 million euros and 600 million, an increase of between zero and 5 
percent. A year ago Ryanair had forecast profit of between 400 million euros and 440 million for the year to March 
2013. "It's not unusual that the guidance is quite cautious, but they are still forecasting higher profits," said Davy 
stockbrokers analyst Stephen Furlong. "Their cash generation remains spectacular." The company had net cash of 
61 million euros at year end despite having returned almost 500 million to shareholders in November. ( C) Reuters

Ryanair posted record full-year earnings but warned profit growth would slow sharply in the coming 12 months on 
demand weakness in the European Union and high fuel and airport costs.
Europe's largest budget airline reported net profit of 569 million euros (dollar 730 million) for the 12 months to the 
end of March, up 13 percent and ahead of an average analyst forecast of 558 million in a company poll.
But the company said it expected profit for the coming financial year to be at most 600 million euros, an increase of 
5 percent, and could come in flat at 570 million.
"We expect modest yield (revenue per passenger mile) and traffic growth for the full year to be partly offset by 
higher oil and Eurocontrol costs," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement, referring to the pan-
European air traffic control body. "With almost zero yield visibility into (the second half) and the EU wide recession, 
we expect that there will continue to be downward pressure on yields which will dampen full-year profit growth," 
O'Leary said. Ryanair, which will not begin to receive any of the 175 Boeing jets it ordered in March until the 
following year, said it expects passenger numbers to grow 3 percent in coming year, compared with growth of 5 
percent in 12 months to March. He said bookings on new routes and bases in the coming summer were ahead of 
expectations, but warned that average fares were modest. Ryanair shares closed on Friday at 6.33 euros, up 35 
percent since the start of the year, compared with a rise of 55 percent at rival easyJet and 18 percent in the broader 
Irish stock market index. ( C) Reuters

The ISEQ soared by over 60 points this morning as Ryanair shares took off following their record profits and 
revenues for the year to the end of March last.
The index rose 63.04 points to 4,067.61.
Ryanair shares jumped 55c to E6.88 after it reported after tax profits of E569m for the year to the end of March, up 
13pc on the previous year. Revenues for the year rose 13pc to E4.88 billion as passenger numbers grew by 5pc to 
79.3 million despite the airline grounding up to 80 winter aircraft. During the year, the airline opened seven new 
bases - at Chania in Greece, Eindhoven and Maastricht in the Netherlands, Fez and Marrakech in Morocco, Krakow 
in Poland, and Zadar in Croatia.
It also started flying on 217 new routes to give a total of over 1,600. The airline said that fuel costs rose by over 
E290m during the year and now represent 45pc of total costs. Its ancillary revenues outpaced its traffic growth, 
rising by 20pc to E1.064 billion, or 22pc of total revenue. "On the back of these results and the guidance we will not 
be reducing our FY14 PAT forecast of E640m although we are likely to rebalance our Q1 and Q2 estimates to 
reflect the prevailing yield and fuel dynamics. Indeed, given the fuel guidance, we could see an increase in our 
FY15 estimates," said Goodbody Stockbrokers. Elan's stocks rose 8c to E8.96 after its chief executive Kelly Martin 
said today that the group will still have dollar 1.2 billion of cash left to spend if shareholders approve its first 
package of acquisitions. It plans to announce more deals in the second half of the year, he added. Elan earlier 
agreed to buy Austrian rare drug specialist AOP Orphan for E263.5m and pay dollar 40m for a 48pc stake in Dubai-
based sales and marketing firm Newbridge pharmaceuticals. That followed a dollar 1 billion royalties deal just a 
week ago as the company looks to fend off a takeover bid from US investment firm Royalty Pharma and reshape its 
business following a multi-billion dollar drug sale in February.

The ISEQ soared by over 60 points this morning as Ryanair shares took off following their record profits and 
revenues for the year to the end of March last.
The index rose 63.04 points to 4,067.61.
Ryanair shares jumped 55c to E6.88 after it reported after tax profits of E569m for the year to the end of March, up 
13pc on the previous year. Revenues for the year rose 13pc to E4.88 billion as passenger numbers grew by 5pc to 
79.3 million despite the airline grounding up to 80 winter aircraft. During the year, the airline opened seven new 
bases - at Chania in Greece, Eindhoven and Maastricht in the Netherlands, Fez and Marrakech in Morocco, Krakow 
in Poland, and Zadar in Croatia.
It also started flying on 217 new routes to give a total of over 1,600. The airline said that fuel costs rose by over 
E290m during the year and now represent 45pc of total costs. Its ancillary revenues outpaced its traffic growth, 
rising by 20pc to E1.064 billion, or 22pc of total revenue. "On the back of these results and the guidance we will not 
be reducing our FY14 PAT forecast of E640m although we are likely to rebalance our Q1 and Q2 estimates to 
reflect the prevailing yield and fuel dynamics. Indeed, given the fuel guidance, we could see an increase in our 
FY15 estimates," said Goodbody Stockbrokers. Elan's stocks rose 8c to E8.96 after its chief executive Kelly Martin

A sharp rise in earnings from add-on charges for items such as baggage and pre-assigned seating helped boost 
Ryanair's earnings above expectations in the past year, lifting its shares to a record high.
Ryanair, which helped pioneer a business model in which low ticket prices are supplemented with charges for 
extras like printing boarding passes and carrying luggage, flew 5 percent more passengers last year, but earned 20 
percent more on extras.
That helped lift net profit 13 percent to a record 569 million euros in the year through March, ahead of an average 
analyst forecast of 558 million in a company poll.
Its shares rose more than 9 percent to a 6.90 euros peak. Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the result was a 
"testimony to the strength of Ryanair's ultra-low cost model." Key to the increase in so called "ancillary" charges 
was the roll-out of a scheme to allow the advance booking of specific seats across the network, allowing 
passengers to bypass the sometimes unruly rush to secure good seats on Ryanair flights. Ryanair said the service 
had proved particularly popular with businesspeople trading down from Europe's older national carriers, many of 
which are struggling to deal with high fuel prices and more cost-conscious travellers. Ryanair regularly raises the ire 
of customers and consumer groups by introducing charges for everything from printing boarding cards to booking 
flights on its web site. But O'Leary, its outspoken boss, insists the fact Ryanair flies more international passengers 
than any other airline makes Ryanair the "world's favourite airline", a slogan previously used by British Airways. It 
remains to be seen if Ryanair can sustain the same level of growth in add-ons. Chief Operating Officer Michael 
Cawley said in an interview last week it was difficult to predict ancillary revenues in the medium term, saying 
management had been surprised by the success of reserved seating. He said ancillaries would likely grow a little 
ahead of passenger growth. Total revenue increased 13 percent to 4.9 billion euros as average fares increased by 
6 percent. Costs, measured per passenger mile, increased 8 percent, mainly due to an 18 percent increase in the

price of fuel. In a relatively downbeat outlook, O'Leary forecast profit would grow by 5 percent at most in the coming 
year, with prices for fuel and air traffic control eating into profits. Capacity growth will slow to 3 percent from 5 last 
year as it waits for deliveries to begin on 175 Boeing jets it ordered in March and most of that will come from 
grounding fewer planes in the traditionally weaker winter months. But Ryanair typically underestimates its 
performance at the start of the year and Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar described the outlook as 
"cautious." A year ago Ryanair had forecast net profit of between 400 million euros and 440 million for the year to 
March 2013. Analyst Stephen Furlong at Davy Stockbrokers said: "It's not unusual that the guidance is quite 
cautious, but they are still forecasting higher profits ... Their cash generation remains spectacular." The company 
had net cash of 61 million euros at year end despite having returned almost 500 million to shareholders in 
November. O'Leary added that profit in the first quarter to the end of June will be lower as the busy Easter period 
fell in the fourth quarter. But bookings on new routes, which include Morocco, the Netherlands and Greece, in the 
coming summer were ahead of expectations, albeit with fares at modest levels. Profit growth of 5 percent would still 
be impressive compared with some of Ryanair's peers. Airlines like British Airways-owner IAG, Lufthansa and Air 
France-KLM have been slashing jobs and shelving growth plans as they grapple with soaring fuel prices and a 
weak economy. IAG for instance last week posted an operating loss of 278 million euros in the first quarter, 
traditionally a weak period for airlines. Ryanair's largest low-cost rival easyJet last week said it expected 4 percent 
growth in revenue per seat in the next six months and improved profitability for the full-year. (Reuters)

Body
Revenues rose by 13 per cent to E 4.88 billion at low cost airline Ryanair, whilepre-tax profits increased by 3 per 
cent to E 650.9 million, on the back of strong passenger growth, according to the airline's full-year results for the 
year to March 31st 2013.
Growth was dampened by rising unit costs, which increased by 8 per cent on the back of an 18 per cent (E 292 
million) increase in fuel. Fuel costs now represent 45 per cent of total costs for the airline.
However, despite grounding up to 80 winter aircraft, passenger traffic grew by 5 per cent, with some 79.3 million 
passengers in the year to March 31st 2013, up from 75.8 million the previous year. The airline's balance sheet 
remains in a strong position, with gross cash of over E 3.5 billion and year-end net cash of E 61 million.
Although Ryanair has opened seven new bases this year - Chania (Greece), Eindhoven (Netherlands), Fez 
(Morocco), Krakow (Poland), Maastricht (Netherlands), Marrakech (Morocco) and Zadar (Croatia) - the airline 
expects that traffic growth will be more modest this summer, at about 2 per cent. However, the second half of the 
year may make up for this. The Irish Times XXXX ULSTER Bank is to re-enter the commercial property market with 
a limited appetite to advance new real estate loans and so-called vendor finance to bidders for the bank's own 
property-backed assets, the Irish Independent has learnt. Senior figures at the country's third-biggest bank have 
confirmed that its UK parent RBS has signed off on allowing Ulster to make new loans for commercial real estate 
deals. It is the latest sign that lenders are trying to revive the market, in part because banks themselves need an 
active market if they want to sell off their own boom era assets. The Irish Independent XXXX Homeowners who 
want to move house but are afraid of losing their low interest tracker mortgages will be offered a lifeline by two 
major banks. A tracker is a mortgage linked to the currently low rate set by the European Central Bank. Trackers 
are so cheap at the moment that the 375,000 homeowners who have them are reluctant to move house because 
they will lose the valuable mortgage rate. Now the Irish Independent has learned that Bank of Ireland is to let 
movers keep their trackers for five years if they move house. And Permanent TSB is close to signing off on a new 
Roundup- Ulster to re-enter Comm property News Roundup
deal that will see families moving keep their tracker rate for the rest of the loan period. The Irish Independent XXXX 
Ireland's tax rules for multinational corporations will be back in focus tomorrow when a powerful US Senate 
committee questions the head of technology giant Apple on its offshore assets. The deepening economic crisis is 
leading big countries such as the US and UK to question the relatively low amounts they take in from taxing large, 
profitable corporations. Apple has previously been criticised for using a tax avoidance structure dubbed the "double 
Irish" that involves using companies based here to reduce its overall tax bill. The Irish Independent

The ISEQ rose to its highest since August of 2008 today as Ryanair shares took off following their record profits and 
revenues for the year to the end of March last.
The index rose 58.82 points to 4,063.39.
Ryanair shares jumped 44c to E6.77 after it reported after tax profits of E569m for the year to the end of March, up 
13pc on the previous year. Revenues for the year rose 13pc to E4.88 billion as passenger numbers grew by 5pc to 
79.3 million despite the airline grounding up to 80 winter aircraft. During the year, the airline opened seven new 
bases - at Chania in Greece, Eindhoven and Maastricht in the Netherlands, Fez and Marrakech in Morocco, Krakow 
in Poland, and Zadar in Croatia.
It also started flying on 217 new routes to give a total of over 1,600. The airline said that fuel costs rose by over

rising by 20pc to E1.064 billion, or 22pc of total revenue. "On the back of these results and the guidance we will not

Body
(RTTNews) - Irish low cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Monday reported 13 percent increase in 
profit for fiscal 2013, including mainly 6 percent increase in average fares and strong ancillary revenues. 
Meanwhile, fuel costs, which represented 45 percent of total costs, grew 18 percent from last year.
Due to lower yields and higher fuel costs, the company expects first-quarter net profit to be lower than last year. 
The shares rose about 6 percent in the morning trade, on the London Stock Exchange.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, revenues rose 13 percent as traffic grew 5 percent to 79.3 million 
passengers. But unit costs increased 8 percent as a result of the rise in fuel costs. Excluding fuel, unit costs rose 3 
percent.
The company noted that its results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, reflecting airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Ryanair expects these 
variations to continue.
Ryanair also said its recent order for 175 firm B 737-800 aircraft represents an enormous opportunity for 
shareholders.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, profit attributable to equity holders of parent was 569.3 million euros or 
39.33 euro cent per share, higher than 560.4 million euros or 37.94 euro cent per share in the year ago.
Excluding exceptional items related to a one-off release of ticket sales revenue of 57.8 million euros net of tax, 
prior-year earnings totaled 34.03 euro cents per share. .
Total operating revenues from continuing operations grew 13 percent to 4.88 billion euros from 4.39 billion euros 
last year. Total revenue per passenger rose 8 percent, primarily due to a 6 percent increase in average fare and 
strong growth in ancillary revenues. Ancillary revenues were 1.06 billion euros, up from 886.2 million euros a year 
ago.
Total operating expenses advanced to 4.17 billion euros from 3.71 billion euros in the preceding year. Fuel and oil 
costs were 1.89 billion euros, compared to 1.59 billion euros in fiscal 2012.
Ryanair Full-year Net Up 13%, But Sees Lower Profit In Q1
For fiscal year 2014, the firm expects traffic to grow by 3 percent to 81.5 million. Modest yield and traffic growth is 
expected to be partly offset by higher oil and Eurocontrol costs, the company stated. Profit for fiscal 2014 is 
expected to increase to a range of between 570 million euros and 600 million euros.
In London, Ryanair shares are currently trading at 6.69 pence, up 0.36 pence or 5.7 percent, on a volume of 
671,165 shares.

(RTTNews) - Ryanair (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported fiscal-year pretax profit of 650.9 million euros, compared to 633.0 
million euros last year. Pre exceptional pretax profit for the prior year period was 567.7 million.
Profit for the year all attributable to equity holders of parent was 569.3 mllion euros or 39.33 euro cent per share, 
compared to 560.4 million euros or 37.94 euro cent per share last year. Pre exceptional Profit to equity holders for 
the prior year period was 502.6 million euros or 34.03 euro cent per share. Ryanair said profit after tax increased 
primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares and strong ancillary revenues offset by an 18% rise in fuel costs.
Total operating revenues from continuing operations increased to 4.88 billion euros, from 4.39 billion euros last 
year. Total operating revenues increased 13% primarily due to a 6% rise in average fares which was partially 
assisted by the strength of sterling to the euro, a 5% increase in passenger numbers and strong ancillary revenues, 
the Group said. Total revenue per passenger rose by 8%, primarily due to a 6% increase in average fare and strong 
growth in ancillary revenues.
The Group expects traffic in fiscal year 2014 to grow by 3%. Ryanair expects that there will continue to be 
downward pressure on yields which will dampen full year profit growth. Modest yield and traffic growth for the full 
year is expected to be partly offset by higher oil and Eurocontrol costs resulting in another year of profit growth in 
fiscal 2014 which - subject to winter yield outturns - should increase to a range of between 570 million euros to 600 
million euros, Ryanair said.

 Just weeks after Vodafone warned of a "lean" year for dividends from Verizon Wireless, the US wireless operator 
it jointly owns with Verizon, it was revealed last week that the UK-based mobile operator will receive a dividend 
worth £2.1bn from the venture, writes Robert Budden.
Shareholders in Vodafone will be looking for clarity on how the mobile operator plans to use this cash. Some 
analysts are predicting it will plough some of it back into a new share buyback scheme after the current buyback 
expires in July. Others expect it may hold on to the cash for future investment.
Analysts are forecasting group revenue declines of around 4 per cent for the year to the end of March amid tough 
markets in Europe. Consensus expectations for adjusted earnings per share are 15.39p, against 14.91p last time 
with pre-tax profit expected at £10.1bn, a rise of 1.7 per cent on the previous year.

  Two burning questions could be settled by FirstGroup when the rail and bus operator announces its full-year 
results, writes Mark Odell.
Investors are waiting for the company to clarify its dividend policy after management signalled at the time of the 
interims that it could abandon its pledge to increase its full-year payout by 7 per cent. Some analysts believe the 
group could cut the dividend sharply, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecasting a drop to 10p per share from 
23.7p a year earlier.
The possibility of a rights issue still hangs over the stock. Management has not ruled it out but insisted there is no 
urgency: the ongoing disposal programme and possible dividend cut could give the group headroom.
Investors will be hoping there are further signs of improvement at the two ailing bus businesses - its US school bus 
operations and the UK bus division.
Revenues are forecast to come in slightly higher at around £6.9bn with pre-tax profits reduced sharply by 
expectional charges to £96.8m, according to Investec.  The PC industry's worst start to the year on record does not

Global PC shipments fell 14 per cent in the first quarter, according to the IDC research firm, the worst drop since it 
began tracking them in 1994.
HP's own shipments were down 24 per cent year-on-year at 12m units, although it held on to the number one spot 
with a 15.7 per cent market share, ahead of Lenovo's 15.3 per cent.
There was equally bad news when the Gartner research firm came out with first-quarter figures for the high-margin 
servers HP sells, showing its rival Dell was eating into its leading market share. HP's share shrank from 29.2 per 
cent to 25 per cent, while Dell's increased from 21.5 to 22.2 per cent.
HP is predicting earnings will be essentially flat compared with the previous quarter, at 80 to 82 cents a share.

 Investors will be watching to see whether SABMiller's glass is half full or half empty when the world's second-
biggest brewer reports full-year results, writes Louise Lucas.
Consensus forecasts call for a 14 per cent rise in group earnings before interest, tax and amortisation to $6.4bn, 
boosted by the first full-year inclusion of Foster's of Australia.
Gloom reigns in Europe, where cash-strapped drinkers are trading down and sales are expected to dip; fortunes are 
only a tad better in North America where they are flatlining.
Even the brighter - and to be fair, bigger - stars in SABMiller's firmament have hiccups: foreign exchange is set to 
weigh on South Africa.
In Latin America, the biggest profit pool, the economic slowdown may temper growth. However, the group's ability 
to raise pricing in some of these markets and encourage drinkers to trade up to higher margin drinks is expected to 
help cushion some of this.   United Utilities starts the reporting round for the UK's listed water companies well

£592m.
But the real attention will be on whether there is any movement on a takeover approach for its peer Severn Trent

European shares edged to fresh five-year highs today, boosted by strength in German stocks and a travel sector 
lifted by a surge in Ryanair.
Travel and leisure stocks gained 1.1 percent, led by a 6.9 percent jump in Ryanair after it reported expectation-
beating earnings for the past year, lifting its shares to a record high.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 closed 0.3 percent higher at 1,251.53, on a quiet day of trade with Swiss, 
Austrian, Danish and Norwegian stock markets shut for a holiday.
The German blue-chip DAX index outperformed, rising 0.6 percent after it bounced off strong support at 8,400, 
while the Spanish IBEX suffered from profit taking after it breached but failed to hold above the March high. "The 
8,400 (level on the DAX) was previously resistance, and it has bounced off it today. If it breaks below there we 
could see more selling, but for today it was a good place to buy the dips," Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at

European shares edged to fresh five-year highs today, boosted by strength in German stocks and a travel sector 
lifted by a surge in Ryanair.
Travel and leisure stocks gained 1.1 percent, led by a 6.9 percent jump in Ryanair after it reported expectation-
beating earnings for the past year, lifting its shares to a record high.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 closed 0.3 percent higher at 1,251.53, on a quiet day of trade with Swiss, 
Austrian, Danish and Norwegian stock markets shut for a holiday.
The German blue-chip DAX index outperformed, rising 0.6 percent after it bounced off strong support at 8,400, 
while the Spanish IBEX suffered from profit taking after it breached but failed to hold above the March high. "The 
8,400 (level on the DAX) was previously resistance, and it has bounced off it today. If it breaks below there we 
could see more selling, but for today it was a good place to buy the dips," Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at

Wheeee . . . When a stock has more than trebled in 18 months solely on trading grounds, investors have to ask 
when the trajectory will flatten out. In easyJet's case, the answer was not on Wednesday. News of a near-halved 
loss , at £61m before tax, in the six months to the end of March and the promise of improved returns for the full 
year, lifted the low-cost carrier's shares 6 per cent.
EasyJet has not been alone in its stellar path. Over the same period, Ryanair's shares have almost doubled, while 
those of Norwegian Air Shuttle have outflown everyone. This reflects rare capacity discipline in the intra-European 
market as legacy carriers - Air France-KLM, Lufthansa - prune lossmaking short-haul operations, and weaker rivals 
- Malev, Spanair - fold. On easyJet routes, competitor capacity fell 3 per cent, year on year, in the six months just 
ended. That mirrored a similar drop in the second half of easyJet's 2011-12 financial year. The carrier, by contrast, 
increased its own capacity by 3.3 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively. The competitor decline may ease off to 
about 1 per cent this summer, but easyJet still expects a 3.5 per cent rise.
Can the trend continue? EasyJet route network development has been shrewd. Focusing on the likes of France and 
Switzerland, it avoids too much head-to-head competition with Ryanair. Executives also argue that non-low cost 
point-to-point traffic at its top 20 airports amounts to 86m seats - almost double easyJet's existing capacity there - 
and that these are up for grabs. That may over-egg matters somewhat: slot constraints and regulatory costs may 
not make all this traffic attractive. Still, with legacy retrenchment ongoing and certain new market prospects - 
Russia, Scandinavia - opportunities are not exhausted. Shares, on 15 times 2012-13 earnings, aren't a steal. But 
they may not be ready to level off just yet.

The problem
After Charles Ramsey helped free three women in Cleveland, Ohio, he told reporters he was "eating a 
McDonald's" when he had heard one of the hostages screaming. The company tweeted in support. How do 
brands get the balance right on a sensitive story?
The advice
The academic Paul A. Argenti I'm sure the last thing that McDonald's social media team expected last week was 
becoming embroiled in a kidnapping case in Cleveland. But the company did a great job of balancing what was a 
very sticky situation.
In the end, it gave the hero in this case - a customer - the equivalent of a social media "shout-out" with its "way to 
go" tweet. By saying it would "be in touch", the company showed that it, like everyone else, are both listening 
carefully and grateful for what he did. This was done with lots of thought and care by McDonald's, and it shows. The 
writer is a professor of corporate communication at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College
The executive Rita Clifton It's certainly a dilemma for brands whether and how to jump on topical bandwagons - 
particularly if they involve trauma or tragedy. And in an all-seeing digital world, mistakes never go away - they 
escalate at a scale and speed that can destroy reputations. You have to judge the connection and relevance finely, 
in line with your brand's values.
Low-cost Irish airline Ryanair is a particular stranger to the taste police, but the strength of that brand ironically lies 
in its cheapness all round. Opticians Specsavers and Lynx, the men's grooming products brand famous for its racy 
ads, manage to combine wit and topicality, even in risqué situations such as MP's expenses and Prince Harry's 
social life - again, in line with their respective brands. Assess before you press that send button. The writer is 
chairman of Populus and author of 'Brands & Branding'
The PR Mark Borkowski High-profile brands are damned if they do and damned if they don't. In an economy 
where events are driven by social media, brands try to create and exploit shareable stories.
Can you build your brand on the back of a news story
The rules of traditional public relations have been disrupted. Much-hyped techniques such as newsjacking, whereby 
you inject your angles into breaking news, in real time to generate media coverage, have become increasingly 
common.
McDonald's is comfortable with social media and its cryptic tweet suggests the company is relaxed about taking 
advantage of such an opportunity. It recognises the power of a mass audience and its social team grabbed the 
moment. It will be able to strategically switch if Mr Ramsey's exotic backstory is not fit for PR purpose. The writer is

Section: COMMENT
Length: 253 words
Body
EasyJet's move to develop volcanic ash tracking technology shows impressive lateral thinking. Not, in fact, the kind 
of thinking normally associated with the stereotype of a low-cost carrier.
Anyone who doubts that assertion should test it by trying to imagine Ryanair investing time and money developing a 
similar system. For all the raucous protests by Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary when his airline was 
grounded in April 2010 because of airborne ash, investing in a system that would not deliver specific advantage to 
Ryanair is not his style. But, to be fair, IAG boss Willie Walsh - then chief of British Airways - protested just as loudly 
at the time, but has not matched EasyJet's imagination either.
As with all experimental systems, there is a financial risk. After all, this aircraft-mounted ash detector - known as 
Avoid - is not guaranteed to be a total success. So, with airlines presently at their most risk-averse, why is EasyJet, 
with Airbus and Nicarnica Aviation, taking the risk? The answer is that an ash cloud will definitely affect European 
airspace in the future. With some of its aircraft fitted with Avoid, EasyJet may be airborne with loads of zero-
discount passengers when its competition is grounded.
But actually, and EasyJet knows this, aircraft-mounted Avoid will play its part with other sensor technologies in 
keeping the skies usable when ash threatens.

Europe as competitors exit short-haul flying.
Body
Michael O'Leary has pledged to stay another five years and render Ryanair's dominance complete in Europe as 
competitors exit short-haul flying.
Dublin-based Ryanair will seize on the likely failure of major carriers such as Air France-KLM Group to earn profits 
on short routes and the withering of networks at Alitalia SpA in Italy, Iberia in Spain and SAS AB (SAS) in 
Scandinavia, the 52-year-old chief executive officer said in an interview in London.
O'Leary, who has regularly promised to quit Ryanair "in a couple of years," will boost the fleet to more than 400 jets 
by 2018 and aims to double the company's 8.65 billion-euro (dollar 11 billion) market value over the same period. 
That could pave the way for a shift into low-cost trans-Atlantic flying as demand for wide-body planes eases, 
making them cheaper, he said.
"There's going to be a push for the legacy carriers to walk away from the loss-making, short-haul business, handing 
over more and more market share," O'Leary said. "The rate of change is going to speed up. The next five years 
look very interesting and exciting and therefore there is no reason for me to leave." Shares of Ryanair have posted 
a 110 percent price gain since May 2008 and traded at 6.04 euros as of 10:21 a.m. in Dublin. Air France-KLM (AF), 
Europe's biggest airline, has slumped 63 percent over the past five years and Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) of 
Germany, the No. 2, has declined 6.1 percent. Former national carriers including Air France, Lufthansa and British 
Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG) are part-way through the latest revamp of short-
haul flights that are unprofitable and becoming less sustainable as low-cost airlines expand operations. O'Leary 
said that the experiment -- which has seen IAG set up a discount unit, Iberia Express, in Spain and Lufthansa 
develop plans to transfer European flights outside its hubs to low-cost division Germanwings -- won't succeed. "The 
problem with all the flag-carrier airlines is they're ultimately doomed to failure," he said. "They are doomed to fail 
because they're not really committed to low fares." Only a handful of short-haul routes feeding profitable long-haul 
OLeary staying to win European skies OLeary to stay
services will survive even at the biggest operators, while the likes of SAS and LOT Polish Airlines SA may be forced 
into a deeper retrenchment or collapse, O'Leary said. Last year saw the failure of Barcelona-based Spanair SA and 
Hungary's Malev Zrt., plus takeovers including IAG's purchase of Lufthansa unit BMI, the second-biggest slot holder 
at London Heathrow. Lufthansa spokesman Thomas Jachnow said the Cologne-based company is "convinced" that 
the expansion of Germanwings puts it in a good position within Europe, while IAG declined to comment and Air 
France-KLM didn't respond to calls. Under O'Leary, Ryanair's strategy of offering bargain-basement fares rendered 
profitable through the use of secondary airports and a minimum level of customer service has propelled it from 1.7 
million passengers in 1994 to 79 million last year, with the company targeting 100 million by March 2019. "We've re-
invented the European airline industry away from this failed '50s and '60s model where you had to be rich to fly," he 
said in the interview. "And what we're going to do in the next five years is going to be even more revolutionary." 
Ryanair would have found itself with long-haul routes had its succeeded in its latest bid for control of Dublin-based 
Aer Lingus Group Plc (AERL), Ireland's second-biggest carrier and a competitor in the short-haul market. The offer, 
which valued Aer Lingus at 694 million euros, was blocked in February by European Union regulators who ruled it 
would increase fares and reduce choice. A separate inquiry by the U.K. Competition Commission is unlikely to drive 
Ryanair to sell its remaining 30 percent holding, O'Leary said. "If we were forced to sell down our stake in Aer 
Lingus who would we sell it to?" he asked, adding that while the Ryanair board would consider a "reasonable or 
profitable" offer for the 30 percent holding, "nobody wants to buy it." ( C) Bloomberg

Ryanair has also announced the opening of its three new bases by launching a 100,000-seat sale across its entire 
European network, with prices starting from just GBP15.99 for travel in May and June, which are available for 
booking until midnight (24:00hrs) Monday (29 Apr). Ryanair's Robin Kiely said: "Ryanair is delighted to open its

A go-around to remember
Our story about the world's most spectacular airport approaches (Flight International, 5 February) illustrated the 
winner using a familiar photograph of a widebody airliner descending low over sunbathers on St Maarten's beach.
Chris Barnes speculates as to what would happen if the landing pilot pressed the TOGA (take off go around) while 
over the shore. "The max power and high alpha climb out would do some considerable sandblasting and remove 
any remaining punters from the beach," he suggests.
Song for Eamon
Ryanair captain and singer-songwriter Sean Kelly has penned a tribute to fellow Ryanair captain and musician 
Eamon Wall, who died in January.
Kelly, a base captain at Prestwick, first performed the song at a gathering in Scotland for friends and colleagues 
who could not make it to Wall's funeral. "I played Drive Her On, a song I had written about Eamon that seemed to 
capture his spirit. It went down so well that we decided to release it as a charity single," he says.
Proceeds will be donated to the Carlow Kilkenny Home Care Team, the organisation that looked after Wall in his 
last weeks.
Drive Her On (The Ballad Of Eamon Wall) is available as a download from iTunes, Amazon, Spotify and other 
online stores.
Jetihad/Jatihad
When, during its lengthy courtship of India's Jet Airways, Etihad announced a codeshare agreement with JAT, it led 
HSBC analyst Andrew Lobbenberg to mischievously wonder if a typo on an email from James Hogan's office had 
caused confusion.
No Headline In Original
Had, he speculates, a minion gone west to cut a deal with the ailing flag carrier of lowly Serbia (population 7 million) 
rather than one of the emerging giants of aviation in India (population 1.2 million).
Flight fiction
Back when what we said really mattered. The storyline on a recent episode of Endeavour, a prequel to the long-
running TV series Inspector Morse, set in the 1960s, centred on murders at the British Imperial Electric Company, a 
(fictional) family-owned defence contractor building the Standfast surface-to-air missile.
One of the company's directors is seen reading your favourite aviation magazine and remarking: "I see we got a 
good write-up in Flight"
Saving Trident
Tony Jarrett updates us on the effort to restore the last example of a Hawker Siddeley Trident IC. The project needs 
£3,000 ($4,700) to carry out work earmarked for this year.
The aircraft - G-ARPO - the 16th Trident built and the last 1C variant to fly, was dismantled from its last resting 
place at Teesside airport and brought to the Sunderland aircraft museum in 2011.
The volunteers behind the project have already raised £1,100 and say the trijet has been "transformed quite a lot".
This year, they want to finish the flightdeck and fore galley as well as paint the fuselage.
If you want to see how G-ARPO was moved to its latest home, check progress or contribute to the project, go to

Highlight: The airline's order will have to be confirmed by its shareholders on June 18 at an EGM.
Body
Irish low cost carrier Ryanair's order for 175 737-800s will be voted on by the LCCs shareholders at an 
extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on June 18.
The EGM is being called due to the relative size of the order compared with Ryanair's size.
Ryanair asserts that it "reached acceptable pricing" with Boeing on the 175 737 order. A separate presentation 
made in March this year when the order was announced says the pricing was "not dissimilar to the last agreement."
One UK newspaper, The Evening Standard, has reported Ryanair as having agreed 2005 levels of pricing with 
Boeing.
The carrier also says that it has "taken advantage of current low interest rates to secure almost 70% of our fleet 
financing all in at under 3%" in its FY 2013 results.
The 175 jets are scheduled to begin delivery in Autumn 2014, with deliveries finishing in 2018.
The airline is set to dispose of, and return, 28 off lease aircraft from FY 2014 to 2016, with a further 77 being 
returned from 2017 until 2019.
The larger disposal rate coincides with the bulk of Ryanair's deliveries. The carrier will take 46 jets from 2014 until 
2016; and then a further 129 aircraft from 2017 until 2019.
At the end of 2019, Ryanair will operate a fleet of 375 737s.

Highlight: The UK Competition Commission may force Ryanair to dispose of its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus.
Body
Ryanair may be forced to reduce or sell its 29.8% stake in Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus.
The UK Competition Commission (UK CC) has provisionally decided that the stake could reduce competition on 
routes between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.
The UK CC said it was "particularly concerned about Ryanair's influence over Aer Lingus's ability to be acquired by, 
merge with, or acquire another airline".
"We recognize that there has been competition between Aer Lingus and Ryanair since 2006. However, without 
Ryanair's minority shareholding, competition might have been more intense and may be restricted in the future," the 
UK CC says.
The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) referred the case to the UK CC in June 2012, shortly after which Ryanair made its 
third bid for Aer Lingus. The European Commission blocked the bid in February 2013.
Ryanair says the decision is "in breach of EU law" and it will appeal it all the way to the Court of Appeal if 
necessary.
Ryanair referred to the European Commission's ruling from February 2013 that competition between the two 
carriers has "intensified" since 2007.
"Under EU law, the UK CC has a duty of "sincere cooperation" with the EU, and cannot contradict or reach different 
conclusions to the European Commission's findings," Ryanair says.
Aer Lingus says it welcomes the decision by the UK CC and looks forward to assisting in the investigation "into the 
anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding".
The UK CC is in the process of identifying how much of its shareholding Ryanair may have to sell. It expects to 
publish its final report by July 11 2013.

Highlight: An HSBC analyst note states that the fast expanding Asian low cost airline sector faces higher aircraft 
costs than European counterparts did over a decade ago.
Body
Asian low cost carriers (LCCs) are facing higher aircraft costs than Ryanair and Easyjet did over a decade ago 
when they expanded, according to an HSBC analyst note.
Ryanair and Easyjet&s growth was supported by &uniquely advantageous &aircraft costs after 9/11, the report 
states.
Though volume discounts on large orders remain, the report says that no such pricing situation exists for Asian 
LCCs today,
However the report notes: &But the strong aircraft demand across the developing world for fleet growth and 
continuing demand from the developed world for fleet renewal mean that aircraft prices and aircraft financing are 
increasingly expensive.&
The report still sees Asian LCCs as in a high growth phase despite these challenges.
High growth, high population
Year on year, the LCC market is expanding quickly in Asia. Asian LCC market share has grown from 19% in 2011 
to an estimated 25% in 2012.
&The scale of existing aircraft orders suggests that this growth rate will be sustained in the future, with Asian low-
cost carrier aircraft orders equivalent to three times the existing fleet,& the report states.
A lack of road and rail infrastructure, as well as a burgeoning middle class across the region is one factor 
underpinning potential growth, according to the report.
A fluid area
However the Asian market lacks a single market, which has seen carriers set up subsidiaries in different countries. 
This makes the competitive environment vary considerably market by market, the report notes.
Those subsidiaries often set up in populous Asian countries to take on the home markets of their competitors.
Analysis: Asset costs challenge Asian LCCs
Two regions that stand out are Indonesia and China.
Indonesia has a population of half of the EU, and as an archipelago its geography is seen as ideal for aviation.
The report says that the country is the biggest market by population in the ASEAN and offers great potential for 
airlines.
Indonesia&s flag carrier Garuda&s regional subsidiary Citilink has 75 aircraft on order; 25 A320 ceos, 25 A320 neos 
and 25 ATR72-600s. These high orders indicate that potential for high growth in the region has been spotted.
However, domestic rival Lion Air has more than a 40% domestic market share as well as access to key slots from 
the capacity-constrained Jakarta airport, according to the report.
Air Asia&s 49% owned Indonesia AirAsia is also suffering domestically in Indonesia, with only 5% market share the 
report says.
The appeal of China
China has a population double that of the EU.
But the HSBC report says the Chinese sector is underpenetrated relative to other Asian markets.
This is due to regulatory and infrastructure constraints, the report says, which will &shelter Chinese legacy carriers 
from low-cost competition for the foreseeable future.&
However, in the long term, the report does see strong potential for Chinese LCCs.
Spring Airlines is presently the only no frills Chinese carrier. The airline is launching a Japanese joint venture this 
year,

Ryanair deal to open Israel routes

Ryanair is poised to open new routes to Israel after its deputy chief executive, Michael Cawley, met Israeli foreign 
minister Israel Katz in Jerusalem this month and the government there approved the extension of the open skies 
agreement to the Jewish state.
According to Israeli officials, the way has been cleared for the budget airline to begin flying from its European bases 
to Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv starting next April, when the open skies agreement comes into effect for Israel.
The decision, which has not been formally announced, means that Ryanair can fulfil a long-held ambition to extend 
its range into Israel, a major tourist destination with 3.5 million visitors a year.
Last July, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary called on Katz to ratify open skies and signalled his intention to 
begin service to Tel Aviv. Next week, O'Leary is the guest at a business breakfast in London hosted by UK Israel 
Business, a networking organisation that connects British and Israeli firms.
The introduction of open skies has been controversial in Israel, where national carriers El Al, Arkia and Israir fear 
losing market share to new European competitors. Last week, airline workers shut down Ben Gurion Airport during 
strikes that left passengers stranded.
Israel's finance minister Yair Lapid said opening up Israel's airports would bring down costs through increased 
competition. Regularly scheduled flights from European airports to Israel are relatively expensive compared with 
those to competing tourist destinations in Turkey and Cyprus.
Ryanair has long been rumoured to be seeking a way into Israel, with some sources saying it could eventually open 
up to 40 routes from around Europe. Other budget carriers have had some success in Israel already, with Easyjet 
doing 10 weekly flights between London and Tel Aviv.

IAG poised to take controls at Vueling TRAVEL & LEISURE

International Airlines Group is poised to secure control of Vueling, the Spanish low-cost airline, in a move that 
should provide the group with an important source of growth.
IAG, parent of British Airways and Iberia, is paying EUR123.5m to increase its stake in Barcelona-based Vueling 
from 45.9 per cent to 90.5 per cent.
IAG said on Tuesday that Vueling would be a standalone company. "We plan to retain Vueling's current business 
model and management structure and its strong base in Barcelona," said Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive.
Some analysts believe IAG may use Vueling on some of Iberia's short-haul routes if a planned restructuring of the 
lossmaking Spanish flag carrier fails to restore it to profit.
People close to IAG said in January that Vueling could form part of IAG's efforts to compete more effectively 
against Ryanair and easyJet, Europe's largest low-cost carriers by revenue. IAG could seek cost savings by 
eventually using Vueling to provide some short-haul services currently done by British Airways and Iberia .
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Espirito Santo, said that IAG could transfer flying that is currently done elsewhere in the 
group to the low-cost carrier.
"It is likely to be point-to-point short-haul flying currently done by Iberia, where it is competing head to head with 
Ryanair or easyJet," he added.
IAG last November offered to pay EUR7 per share for the Vueling equity that it does not already own.
Vueling's board rejected this tender offer, but recommended improved terms of EUR9.25 per share.
Vueling would remain a listed company with a 9.5 per cent free float because, even though IAG is due to secure 
90.5 per cent of the carrier's equity, it does not gain the right to buy out the remaining shareholders.
IAG poised to take controls at Vueling TRAVEL & LEISURE
Iberia secured its 45.9 per cent stake in Vueling in 2009 when the Barcelona carrier merged with Clickair, which had 
been established by the Spanish flag carrier.
Vueling started flying in 2004, and ran up losses in its early years, but has been reporting operating profits since 
2009.
It was notable last year for strong growth in capacity and earnings. Vueling reported revenue of EUR1.1bn for 2012, 
up 28 per cent compared to 2011, as seating capacity rose by 17 per cent. Earnings before interest and tax almost 
tripled to EUR33.2m.
Vueling also has a robust balance sheet, recording net cash of EUR339.3m at December 31.
With Spain in recession, Vueling has been seeking growth elsewhere in Europe. It carried 14.8m passengers last 
year, an increase of 20 per cent, and is now the third-largest airline at Paris Orly and Rome Fiumicino airports.

The ISEQ powered ahead to surpass the 3,900 level again as investors looked towards Ireland's bailout exit.
The ISEQ rose 100.73 points to 3,930.60.
Finance Minister Michael Noonan has said if there is spare cash after next year's Budget, it will be used to grow the 
economy and create jobs. On his way into Cabinet this morning, Minister Noonan said there is the possibility of 
"spare capacity" next year. But he said the Government has to stick to the targets and can not go on a "spending 
spree".
European shares rose today, buoyed by strong earnings updates and fresh hopes for further monetary easing in the 
region following mixed macro economic data. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data also suggested that 
previously weak euro zone markets were improving, with a downturn in France easing following its worst month in 
March since 2009. However, the so-far resilient German economy saw a sharp drop in business activity in April. 
Back home, CRH was the big mover with shares up 74c to E16.10. Contracts awarded for US highway construction 
continue to improve. Figures released overnight by the American Road and Transportation Builders Association 
(ARTBA) show that contract awards for highway construction rose 11.7pc year-on-year (yoy) in March. This means 
that highway contract awards are up 15pc yoy in the last six months. "This improved awards data reflect the greater 
visibility state and local authorities have over funding following the passage of MAP-21 in July of last year. This

The European Commission has opened an in-depth antitrust investigation of the proposed takeover of Greece's 
Olympic Air by its domestic rival Aegean Airlines.
The Commission, which acts as the 27-country bloc's competition watchdog, said Tuesday it fears "the transaction 
may lead to price increases and poorer service on several domestic Greek routes out of Athens," where the merged 
entity would have a monopoly.
The Commission now has three months to decide on the 72 million euro ($94 million) takeover bid.
A first attempted merger was blocked by the Commission about two years ago on grounds that the combined carrier 
could have monopolized the national market.
The Commission in February also blocked a similar repeated takeover bid by Ryanair for its Irish rival Aer Lingus.

News analysis
Mergers in the EU have not delivered the same market concentration achieved in the US, writes Andrew Parker 
Body
After years of losses at US airlines caused by cut-throat competition in what was a fragmented market, the industry 
hopes it is entering an era of long-term profitability.
Over the past decade, consolidation has reduced the number of large carriers from eight to five, and with the 
merger proposed in February between American Airlines and US Airways , the market is set to cut it to four. Most of 
these carriers reported higher profits last year and some - such as Delta Air Lines - are planning to resume 
returning cash to shareholders via dividends or share buybacks.
But why is this trend struggling to take hold in Europe? Like the US, the EU market has been consolidating - 
through mergers such as that between Air France and KLM, and British Airways and Iberia - but there are still too 
many flag carriers, and profitable budget airlines led by Ryanair and easyJet are providing fierce competition on 
short-haul routes.
Even EU flag carriers that are profitable report falling underlying earnings amid the eurozone recession. Lufthansa, 
Europe's largest carrier by revenue and one of the few to pay a dividend, cancelled its 2012 payout.
Rigas Doganis, visiting professor at the UK's Cranfield University and a non-executive director at easyJet, says 
some of Europe's small and medium-sized flag carriers could be doomed unless they can find protection inside a 
larger group. "They are too small to compete effectively in the long-haul markets against the big players, and too 
high cost to compete effectively in the short-haul markets against the low-cost carriers."
His statement highlights how Europe is likely to have high-profile airline failures and mergers, because 
consolidation of the EU aviation market has not delivered the level of market concentration found in the US.
Consolidation in Europe slow to take off
The wave of US mergers resulted in the top five carriers - United, Delta, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and 
US Airways - holding 82 per cent of domestic seating capacity last year, compared with 68 per cent in 2008, 
according to estimates by Deutsche Bank analysts and Diio Mi, which collects aviation industry data.
These carriers' increasing dominance is providing them with the opportunity to end the irrational practices of the 
past, when airlines would try to usurp each other by increasing capacity and slashing fares.
The remaining big carriers in the US are wielding much greater market power - giving them the opportunity to cut 
capacity and raise ticket prices. This may be bad news for passengers, but investors are hoping US airlines are 
now an attractive proposition. Contrast this situation with Europe, where the top five carriers, Lufthansa, Air France-
KLM, International Airlines Group, Ryanair and easyJet, held only 52 per cent of capacity on flights in the EU last 
year.
The top five European carriers held 41 per cent of capacity in 2008, so market concentration has increased, but it is 
far behind the levels in the US. Profitability is also lower - European airlines had a combined net margin of 0.3 per 
cent in 2012, compared with 2.3 per cent at North American carriers, according to Iata, the industry's global trade 
body.
One important driver of consolidation in the US aviation market has been the country's bankruptcy regime. US 
carriers have used the Chapter 11 procedure to cut their high operating costs.
Brian Havel, director of the International Aviation Law Institute, says: "By using Chapter 11 to reject leases and 
renegotiate labour contracts, struggling airlines become more attractive targets for takeover." This assertion is 
borne out by how US Airways pursued a merger with AMR, American Airlines' parent, after it filed for bankruptcy 
protection in 2011 .
The EU does not have an equivalent to Chapter 11, and the airline mergers that have occurred - led by the 2004 
combination between Air France and KLM - are notable for how they subsequently failed to secure significant cost 
savings through rationalisation.
The three big flag carrier groups - Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG - are now belatedly engaged in 
restructurings, and therefore are unlikely to make large acquisitions soon.
But the biggest factor explaining why US airlines have consolidated far more than EU carriers is the simple truth 
that it is much easier to do mergers in a single country.
Cross-border airline mergers are difficult in the EU, not least because many governments prize having an 
independent flag carrier.
Mergers are also complicated because the industry is surrounded by antiquated ownership rules. Since the 1940s, 
carriers' rights to fly into other countries' airports have been based on bilateral agreements between governments 
that require airlines to be "substantially owned and effectively controlled" by nationals of their own state.
Last week, Siim Kallas, European transport commissioner, used a speech in Washington to make a fresh push for 
consolidation between European and American carriers , so that they can compete more effectively against fast-
growing Gulf and Asian airlines. He called for lawmakers to relax rules preventing foreign companies owning more 
than 25 per cent of US airlines.
But Ed Bastian, Delta's president, says such reform is unlikely, because workers fear mergers with EU carriers 
would mean job losses.
"The employees of the airlines are concerned about jobs in the weak economic setting, and I believe their voice will 
be - and is - heard loud and strong in Washington."

A Ryanair claim against one of Britain's biggest online travel companies for "screen scraping" will be heard in 
Ireland, the High Court has decided.
Ryanair sued On the Beach in September 2010, seeking a declaration that its website's terms of use were binding 
on the English company. The airline is also claiming damages for breach of contract, misrepresentation and 
infringement of Ryanair's trademarks.
Ryanair claimed that the Irish courts had jurisdiction to hear the claim under the 2001 Brussels 1 Regulation, but the 
English company contested the role of the Irish courts.
Juliusz Komorek, Ryanair's director of legal affairs, said the airline earned "significant revenue" through 
advertisements on its website, which took more than 99 cent of its bookings. He said Ryanair's terms of use 
governed the use of its website and were binding on everyone who used the site, irrespective of whether a booking 
was made or not.
The terms of use say that the website is the only site authorised to sell Ryanair flights, and prohibits "screen 
scraping" and links to the website without Ryanair's prior written consent. Anyone using the site must submit to the 
"sole and exclusive jurisdiction" of the Irish courts.
Gwendoline Parry, On the Beach's finance director, said the company was one of Britain's leading online travel 
agencies, with more than 500,000 customers annually. She said the company acted as a web search engine to 
facilitate consumer bookings with airlines, tour operators, airport car parks, hotels, car hire firms and insurance 
companies, primarily through its website, onthebeach.co.uk, and its automated call centre.
She said unnamed third party data suppliers, which were unconnected to On the Beach, provided the Ryanair flight 
data. Parry said her company was "not involved in any screen scraping activities" until February 2012. She said 
that, as agent for the customer, On the Beach ticked the box to accept Ryanair's terms and conditions of travel and 
website use, but she said the contract was still between the customer and Ryanair.
Ryanair case against travel firm will be heard in Ireland
But Ryanair said that, at no point during On the Beach's search and booking process were consumers transferred 
to the Ryanair website or made aware of the airline's terms of use.
Parry said Ryanair's on-line and booking services were hosted in Britain and Germany, and any data "allegedly" 
accessed by her company was hosted outside Ireland, so the Irish courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the 
dispute. But Ryanair claimed that it had three data centres in Dublin, London and Frankfurt, to avoid any centre 
crashing due to excess demand.
On the Beach also claimed that it was entitled to make the bookings under the E-commerce Directive, but Miss 
Justice Mary Laffoy said this was a "red herring", as the directive did not deal with the court's jurisdiction.
The judge said that, in the online airline and travel agency business, website users became contractually bound by 
ticking a box agreeing to terms shown on the website. "In reality, it is difficult to see how online trade could be 
carried on in the absence of those devices."
She said the evidence "clearly demonstrates" that On the Beach was aware of this practice, and whether the 
English company was acting as agent or principal was irrelevant to the issue of jurisdiction. If On the Beach went 
beyond its first encounter with the hypertext link, she said, "there are two active participants because, as the saying 
goes, it takes two to tango".

Project Phoenix sends Alitalia hurtling towards abyss

Body
Like post-election Italy, Alitalia is leaderless, short on cash and confused about its future. The sorry resemblance 
between nation and national airline is not coincidental. Alitalia's desperate condition arises from the same politically 
driven industrial decisions and misused public money that for decades have hobbled Italian economic performance.
At Alitalia these failings culminated in a rescue plan hatched five years ago by a cabal of Italian political, 
bureaucratic, banking and industrial interests. None of them knew much about the airline industry, but the 
ringleaders were hell-bent on preventing a foreign takeover of the stony broke flag-carrier. Their plan, codenamed 
"Project Phoenix", put Alitalia on a trajectory that increasingly looks like a boomerang to bankruptcy.
According to industry specialists at the Sydney-based Capa Centre for Aviation , Alitalia has made a cumulative net 
loss since its relaunch in 2009 of EUR843m. Other than low-cost carriers such as easyJet and Ryanair, few 
European airlines are these days in comfortable financial health. But the malaise of Alitalia stands out. Its cash 
reserves were so depleted two months ago that it required a EUR150m loan from its shareholders to stay in the air.
Now it is difficult to see where salvation will come from. If salvation means inspired leadership, then it will not come 
from Andrea Ragnetti, the hapless chief executive who resigned in February after a mere 12 months in office, 
pausing only to announce that Alitalia had made a EUR280m net loss in 2012. If salvation means a fresh injection 
of long-term capital, then it will not come from Air France-KLM, which bought a 25 per cent stake in Alitalia in 2009. 
The French-Dutch airline group is itself too financially squeezed to risk a second bet on one of Italy's most 
notoriously lossmaking companies.
As for the Italian investors who joined the 2008 rescue consortium organised by Silvio Berlusconi, the former 
premier, some are said to be losing patience with Alitalia's seemingly incurable addiction to other people's cash. A 
binding agreement to stay part of the consortium expired in January. Now investors such as Atlantia, a motorway 
operator, and Immsi, an industrial investment company, are free to sell their stakes.
An attempt at salvation may, of course, come from Italian politicians and state administrators of similar 
temperament to those who poured several billion euros into Alitalia between 1998 and 2008 in the name of 
Project Phoenix sends Alitalia hurtling towards abyss
maintaining the airline's Italian identity. The state still owns almost half of Alitalia, so the temptation to patch things 
up one more time, if only temporarily, will be strong.
Particularly in northern Italy, the nation's financial and industrial heartland, there are political forces that view the 
preservation of an airline with a strong Milan presence as essential to their influence.
But once Italy emerges from political paralysis and forms a stable government - a prospect still some months away - 
the reality will sink in that the nation is trapped in economic stagnation, ever at risk in the eurozone debt crisis and 
unable to throw money at dysfunctional public sector companies as liberally as it used to. It is also open to doubt 
that Europe's competition regulators would let Alitalia get away with yet another dollop of state aid.
In this context it is good that Italy's antitrust regulators have opened the all-important route between Rome 
Fiumicino and Milan Linate airports to more competition. It says everything about Alitalia and its monopolistic 
mindset that the airline's lawyers tried to block the regulators' order last October to hand over seven slots at Linate 
to easyJet. Before 2008, Alitalia enjoyed such control of this lucrative route that the airline allocated a number of 
seats every day to its own staff, who merrily shuttled at no cost to themselves between Milan and Rome. No wonder 
the losses piled up at Alitalia. No wonder that ruthlessly cost-conscious discount airlines have made such inroads 
into the Italian market .
In fairness to Alitalia's staff, some improvements have taken place over the past four years. The airline no longer 
has the reputation of being Europe's worst for taking off and landing on time. Alitalia's aircraft are more modern, and 
so is the attitude of its employees towards customers. In December, Alitalia won a "best airline cuisine" award from 
Global Traveler, a US magazine, for the third successive year. But delicious food and service with a smile will not 
be enough to keep Alitalia competitive. How Italy's politicians and business people settle the airline's future will be 
the measure of how serious they are about reforming the Italian economy.

BMW has been named the most reputable organisation in Ireland, according to the results of the annual Ireland 
RepTrak  2013 study, announced by Corporate Reputations today.
The study measured the reputations of 100 firms in Ireland between January and February 2013, based on more 
than 14,000 consumer ratings from members of the general public.
BMW ranked first among the firms studied, with Apple 2nd, Google 3rd, Volkswagen 4th and Toyota 5th.
The independent study ranked how highly organisations are held in esteem, how much they are admired and 
trusted, and how good the general public feels about them. It also studied how an organisation was rated across the 
key dimensions of reputation, which are leadership, innovation, governance, workplace, performance, citizenship 
and innovation. Michael Nugent, Director, Sales & Marketing, BMW Ireland at BMW Group Ireland, said, "BMW 
Group Ireland is delighted to be recognised by the RepTrak  2013 study as the company with the best corporate 
reputation in Ireland. This endorses the long term investment by us in the Irish market." Eamon Gilmore, T.D., 
Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs & Trade, presenting the awards to the best performing companies this 
morning, said, "Ireland's international reputation has improved dramatically over the past two years. Part of that is 
attributable to the calibre of the work being done here both by indigenous and multinational companies, including 
those highlighted in this study." Speaking at this morning's event, Niamh Boyle, Managing Director, Corporate 
Reputations, said, "The best companies in Ireland don't leave their reputation to chance. They ensure that 
reputation management is an integral part of their business strategy." Kerry Group retained its position as the 
highest ranked indigenous firm (7th overall) and was followed by Superquinn, An Post, Irish Distillers and Dairygold 
in the Top 5 indigenous category. Coming last of the top 100 was Allied Irish Banks, followed by Ryanair, Bank of

Iberia is planning deeper wage cuts for employees after failing to reach agreement with trade unions on productivity 
improvements at the lossmaking Spanish airline.
Iberia, part of International Airlines Group, said pilots and cabin crew would face wage cuts of 18 per cent, rather 
than a 14 per cent reduction. Ground staff face cuts of 11 per cent rather than 7 per cent. These deeper cuts are 
consistent with recommendations by a governmentappointed mediator asked to bring an end to strikes at the 
Spanish airline.
Iberia last November proposed cutting 4,500 jobs at Iberia - 22 per cent of the workforce - but last month it 
accepted the mediator's proposal that the figure should be reduced to 3,141.
Unions representing ground staff and cabin crew have accepted the mediator's recommendations.
Sepla, the pilots' union, has not accepted the recommendations, but Iberia said the proposed 18 per cent cut in 
wages would apply to this group of employees. Sepla could not be reached for comment.
The deeper wage cuts should provide Iberia with a quicker route to cost savings than productivity improvements, 
although changes to working practices are still likely to be needed if Iberia is to compete better against budget 
airlines led by Ryanair and long-haul carriers such as Latam Airline Group.
The losses at Iberia pushed IAG to a pre-tax loss of EUR997m last year. British Airways, IAG's UK subsidiary, 
recorded a EUR295m operating profit in 2012, while Iberia reported an EUR896m loss, partly because of a large 
impairment charge.

With 2013 well under way, the latest data from DTZ Sherry FitzGerald Research suggests that the gradual recovery 
of the Dublin office market is continuing.
Strong leasing activity, coupled with positive signs of demand for office space, saw a robust volume of transaction 
activity recorded in quarter one. The opening quarter of 2013 also witnessed renewed interest in demand for larger 
office floor-plates.
Despite a more challenging year than expected for the office market in 2012, the market did enjoy a surge in activity 
in the closing quarter. This trend has continued into 2013 with strong performance recorded during the opening 
three months of the year.
While the proportion of occupied space fell during the quarter to approximately 19,600 square metres, the quantity 
of space signed rose significantly during the three-month period. A total of 47,000 square metres was signed at the 
end of quarter one, and with a further 53,750 square metres reserved, office transaction activity for the first half of 
2013 is expected to surpass the level attained in 2012.
Having said that, the level of net take-up, which measures the change in occupied space, declined during the first 
quarter of the year to stand at -20,800 square metres. While there was a robust level of activity during the opening 
quarter, a significant proportion of this involved movement within the market. Furthermore, the proportion of space 
signed during quarter one outweighed the proportion of space occupied, thus not impacting the level of net take-up.
An analysis of the profile of space transacted during the opening quarter reveals a notable increase in the number 
of deals greater than 1,000 square metres. In relation to the space occupied, the largest deal taken-up during the 
quarter measured 2,500 square metres. This was the occupation by IBM at the Iona Building on Shelbourne Road 
in Ballsbridge.
Market slowly coming back
A further 1,850 square metres was occupied by Guidewire at the Nexus Building at Blanchardstown Corporate Park 
in Dublin 15. There were also a number of deals signed during the quarter, including approximately 4,700 square 
metres signed by Salesforce at Number One Central Park in Leopardstown, Dublin 18.
Investec has also signed an additional 2,300 square metres in the Harcourt Building, while SIG International has 
agreed terms on 5,100 square metres of office space at International House in the IFSC.
While demand remains driven primarily by lease events, quarter one of 2013 also saw an increased interest from 
occupiers in purchasing their own buildings. This is evidenced by Ryanair purchasing approximately 8,400 square 
metres of office space at the Concourse at Airside Business Park and approximately 7,760 square metres 
purchased by Airtricity at Red Oak South in Leopardstown. However, these buildings have not yet been occupied.
Active demand during the quarter remains focused on modern accommodation, in particular Grade A 
accommodation. This is evidenced by the fact that 77 per cent of space occupied in the central business district 
(CBD) during 2012 comprised Grade A space. Moreover, 52 per cent comprised newer Grade A1 space. We 
anticipate this trend to continue in 2013 and, as a result, the best space in the best buildings will continue to 
diminish.
The IT/telecommunications was the most active sector in 2012, and this trend continued into 2013 with the sector 
accounting for 32 per cent of all transactions during the three-month period. Active occupiers during the quarter 
include IBM and Guidewire.
The finance sector was also active during the quarter accounting for 29 per cent of occupied space, a continuation 
of a trend that was evident during the latter part of 2012. The professional sector accounted for 14 per cent of 
activity while the pharmaceutical/health sector was also active, absorbing 8 per cent of space during the three-
month period.
The total quantity of available office space declined in 2012. The opening quarter of 2013 saw 741,200 square 
metres of office space unoccupied, however there are a number of deals signed and awaiting occupation which in 
turn results in a net availability figure of 694,200 square metres.
Supply levels in the Dublin office market remain polarised. Grade A space in the CBD continues to decline; this is in 
contrast with a healthy level of secondhand accommodation outside the CBD boundaries. Furthermore, with new 
supply non-existent, the shortage of Grade A space has resulted in an improvement in sentiment for refurbishment 
opportunities.
Supply levels in the CBD stood at approximately 255,700 square metres, or 34 per cent of the total available space 
at the end of March. That said, there is approximately 17,200 square metres of office space signed resulting in net 
availability of 238,500 square metres. Moreover, net availability is notably lower, -11 per cent, when compared with 
the corresponding period in 2012.
Grade A space continues to be the most sought-after in the CBD and thus continues to fall at a faster rate. In 
particular, the quantity of Grade A space stands at 165,600 square metres, down 10 per cent on the level recorded 
12 months previously. With the majority of new lettings in quarter one focused on the CBD and no new stock 
delivered to replace this stock, 2013 could see the CBD potentially facing a looming shortage of stock.
Approximately 75 per cent of the volume of available Grade A1 office space is less than 5,000 square metres in 
size, therefore an occupier seeking over 5,000 square metres of prime space has limited choice, with just six floor 
plates available to satisfy this requirement.
That said, the overall level of supply remains stubbornly high by historical standards. This is further highlighted by 
an analysis of the vacancy rate, which stood at 22.1 per cent at the end of March. The corresponding vacancy rate 
in the CBD stood at 14.9 per cent, down from the 16 per cent recorded in the previous year. Approximately 51 per 
cent of the total office stock in the capital is located in the CBD.
Market slowly coming back
The volume of space under construction fell to zero during 2011, and there are still no new development starts 
scheduled. As such, development activity is expected to be limited during 2013, which will allow for a steady 
absorption of the excess space available in the market.
In the CBD, headline rents for third generation prime accommodation stood at approximately EUR 312 per square 
metre at the end of March, having remained static since the second quarter of 2011. Furthermore, the gap between 
prime and secondary stock continues to widen.
That said, as supply levels in the CBD recede, in particular Grade A space, prime rents are beginning to come 
under pressure. While headline rents for third generation accommodation stand at EUR 312, there have been some 
recent transactions within the CBD at headline rents of between EUR 334 and EUR 355 per square metre.
However, these are not an indicator of a wider trend in the market, but reflect the shortage of quality and pent-up 
demand for properties in the CBD. The incentives available on existing new Grade A space have started to tighten 
and lease flexibility is beginning to diminish.

Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, is
flying in to trade union, legal, tax and
political turbulence in Norway over the
way it manages staff.
Allegations are being made that it treats its staff like "slaves" having created hundreds of "shell" companies in 
Ireland and the UK to avoid tax across Europe and to force staff in to contracts that run roughshod over accepted 
norms. In Norway, Ryanair cabin crew and their Union, Parat, have taken the airline to court to clarify their 
employment status in Norway and their contract conditions. The union is backing two flight attendants who were 
sacked. 
The women, who were not employed directly by the airline but by Irish agencies, allege there is a "culture of fear" at 
Ryanair and say crews have no protection. "I live in a country that is the most expensive ever and I have the same 
payment as a southern country wage, and even they don't pay me for sickness," said one of the former crew 
members, named as Alessandra. The Ryanair Pilot Group (RPG) said that more than 70pc of pilots currently 
operating for Ryanair are engaged through a "disguised employment model". The model is operated in conjunction 
with Brookfield Aviation International Limited, a company based in the UK. Through hundreds of Limited Companies 
registered in Ireland, Ryanair have previously avoided direct employer taxes and social insurance payments. This 
issue is currently being investigated by the tax authorities in Germany, while Italian authorities have taken a legal 
case against Ryanair, which is due to be heard soon. The pilots say that one major effect of this model is to remove 
employment rights of its staff under the laws of the country in which they are based and live. They say that the "take 
it, or leave it" approach imposed by Ryanair through Brookfield on pilots and cabin crew is not acceptable. In

executives are currently in Norway and were unavailable for comment. The matter has been raised in the

Several Norwegian leaders are threatening to boycott Ryanair because of a labor dispute between the Ireland-
based budget airline and a former employee who lives in Norway.
The ex-employee, an Italian, is threatening to sue the airline over allegedly poor working conditions she says fail to 
meet Norway's standards.
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary denies any wrongdoing, saying its working conditions conform to the applicable Irish 
and European Union labor laws.
Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Bart Eide was quoted by the Klassekampen leftist daily Friday as saying that he 
won't fly on Ryanair again until the labor issues are resolved.
Other politicians, including the prime minister, have recently made similar comments.
Ryanair has a reputation as one of Europe's most litigation-prone companies, pursuing several cases and facing 
lawsuits from customers and employees.

SHARES in EasyJet flew to the top of the FTSE 100 risers yesterday after analysts raised hopes for a special 
dividend and further earnings growth.
Citigroup upgraded the blue-chip newcomer to a "buy" rating yesterday, flagging up its forecast of 30 per cent 
earnings per share growth this year and expansion of up to seven per cent in subsequent years.
EasyJet, which paid its maiden dividend in November 2011, is generating enough money to pay out nine per cent of 
free cash flow to shareholders through to 2019, raising the prospect of a special dividend, Citi analyst Andrew Light 
said.
"We would not expect a special dividend to be paid, however, before EasyJet has decided on its next aircraft order," 
he added.
The firm remains in talks about a possible plane order for delivery after 2018, a plan that has been aggressively 
opposed by founder and shareholder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou.
Analysts at Citi and Morgan Stanley have this week cheered the growth potential at European low cost leaders 
EasyJet and Ryanair.
Citi expects the market to grow one per cent a year, with the two biggest firms picking up between three and five 
per cent passenger growth each.
Shares in EasyJet, which have risen more than 30 per cent since the start of the year, closed up 6.65 per cent 
yesterday.

Turkish Airlines has followed its March order for 82 Airbus jets with a deal to buy 70 single-aisle aircraft from 
Boeing, the bulk of which will be the US manufacturer's new, more fuelefficient Max model.
The order, which has yet to be finalised, is worth $6.9bn at list prices, and includes options for a further 25 Boeing 
737 Max 8s.
The fast-growing airline, which flies to more countries than any rival - 219 cities in 98 countries - expects passenger 
numbers to grow nearly 20 per cent in 2013 to 46m, and to hit 90m by the end of the decade.
Turkish Airlines, which is half-owned by the government, has committed to buy 50 737 Max jets and 20 current-
generation aircraft over the next eight years.
It plans to leverage Istanbul's proximity to European destinations, as well as the Middle East, Africa and Asia, three 
regions where aviation growth is expected to outpace that in developed economies.
Boeing and Airbus have racked up a series of recent orders, including from IAG - the parent of British Airways and 
Iberia - and Indonesia's Lion Air. Low-cost carrier Ryanair last month agreed to purchase 175 current-generation 
jets with a book value of $16bn.
Investors in easyJet are also awaiting the outcome of the low-cost carrier's deliberations over placing a large order, 
probably with previous supplier Airbus.

To appear in Best of the Brokers, email your research to notes@cityam.com GREENCORE Peel Hunt has started 
covering the convenience food provider with a "hold" rating and target price of 105p. The broker thinks British sales 
of ready meals will be weighed down this year in the wake of the horsemeat scandal, meaning profits at Greencore 
will be driven by its US business. A high level of debt and a pension fund deficit have made Peel Hunt cautious 
about the stock.
EASYJET Morgan Stanley has raised its price target on the airline from 1,060p to 1,375p and maintained its 
"overweight" rating. The broker thinks both EasyJet and Ryanair can deliver at least 50 per cent of their current 
market cap by 2020, thanks to growth potential in the short-haul Europe market and structural cost advantages over 
the legacy airlines.
NESTLE Canaccord Genuity has cut its recommendation from "buy" to "hold" on the food and drinks conglomerate 
and keeps its target at SFr69. Nestle shares have outperformed the Swiss index by 11 per cent in the year to date, 
the broker notes, and the company is facing headwinds including currency fluctuations and softer emerging market

Luton, London Stansted and Manchester Airport." National Express UK Coach Manager Director, Tom Stables said: 
"We operate millions of passenger journeys to UK airports each year and are pleased our new partnership with 
Ryanair makes it that bit easier for people to get their trip off to a flying start. It's now even simpler for 
holidaymakers and business travelers to benefit from affordable airport travel."

Body
One of the recurring themes of this column has been how the internet can vastly improve the quality of your 
research process, notably by making once-expensive institutional-focused research tools available at low cost to 
investors.
The internet is also helping to chip away at the cost of investing, with online stockbrokers and fund platforms using 
the web to push dealing costs down. The new Club Finance share-dealing platform Frequent Trader pushes 
individual dealing ticket prices down to 50p a trade (although you'll still pay an admin fee: £25 per quarter plus 
VAT).
But important as costs may be, they aren't everything. To understand this point, consider the travel industry, where 
"disintermediation" has had a huge impact. Headline costs have tumbled but charges have appeared elsewhere - 
credit card fees, baggage charges and seat reservations. Consumers now understand that they have a choice: 
book it yourself, travel light, do without food and pay less; or pay more, have a travel agent sort it out and get the 
full air travel experience. That means Ryanair and easyJet exist alongside Swiss and Virgin Atlantic.
Consumers are helped through the travel maze by a burgeoning "reviews" industry. TripAdvisor in particular has 
become so ubiquitous that its reviews are often integrated into hotel or airline websites. Like many readers, I rarely 
travel anywhere without first checking the range of comments about my destination first.
Why hasn't this crowd-sourced wisdom spread to the world of investing, where the sums of money at stake are 
rather more material? There are some excellent parts of the MoneySavingExpert website, but if I want to compare, 
say, Barclays with TD, it's hard to find a site that allows me to browse users' views or share investment ideas.
The good news is that some players are making bold new moves on this front. Social investing is emerging fast via 
platforms such as Vidivici , which draws on the wisdom of the crowd to research an investment opportunity. 
VouchedFor allows users to rate independent financial advisers.
Welcome to TripAdvisor for Sipps Adventurous Investor
IFA online platform Investment Sense has just launched its first stab at this form of investment advice via its Sipp 
Chat offering - available at www.investmentsense.co.uk/sipp-chat/ from the beginning of April. In simple terms, this 
is TripAdvisor for Sipps, allowing users to submit reviews, rate their provider in a variety of categories and then 
leave comments. Potential Sipp investors can then use the information to help build up a picture of potential 
providers based on actual user experiences. This is important when you think that a pension plan can be a multi-
decade commitment and the costs of switching providers can be quite high.
The idea is that investors will use the internet not just to pick the cheapest product but the "best product at the best 
price". Again, this is important in the Sipp arena because the limitations of no-frills Sipps are becoming very 
apparent. I'm a case in point - I have a bog-standard wrapper with a major provider, which does just fine as an 
online share-dealing account. But I'd like to diversify my holdings and include less traditional investments such as 
commercial property or private company shares. Will my provider have a product (at the right charge) that will grow 
as my portfolio becomes more diversified? And when I retire, will I be forced down the annuity route, or can I opt for 
some form of drawdown?
Financial and regulatory stability is also increasingly important. "Following the publication of the FSA's consultation 
paper CP 12/33, it's clear that the capital adequacy requirements for almost all Sipp providers will rise considerably 
in the future," says Philip Bray, marketing manager of Investment Sense. Consolidation is highly likely. Could your 
provider be a sitting duck for a bigger group - and what would happen if it were taken over?
Hopefully, as Sipp Chat grows, there'll be a body of commentary that might help Sipp investors make better 
decisions. In the meantime it's worth noting that the top five providers currently are all smaller, more bespoke 
players, offering products that cost a great deal more than the likes of Hargreaves or Sippdeal. They are: Xafinity, 
InvestAcc Pension Administration, Dentons, Barnett Waddingham, and Liberty.

EasyJet narrows range of forecast losses after late Easter bookings
EasyJet narrows range of forecast losses after late Easter bookings

Cold weather in March fuels airline
Body
EasyJet has narrowed its range of forecast losses for the first half of its financial year - the typically quiet late 
autumn and winter months - to £60m-£65m.
The low-cost carrier, which previously forecast a £50m-£75m pre-tax loss, said revenues per seat rose at a slightly 
higher rate than expected in the six months to March 31, thanks in part to last-minute bookings ahead of Easter and 
its earlier timing compared with last year.
The 8.5 per cent growth in unit revenues was partly offset by a 3.5 per cent rise in costs per seat - though this was 
at the lower end of the company's expectations in January. Capacity growth was also held in check by poor weather 
that led to flight cancellations.
Carolyn McCall, chief executive , attributed the company's halving of pre-tax losses from 2011-12 figures to 
industry-wide capacity constraints, as well as the cold March weather across northern Europe, "which stimulated 
strong bookings in the last few weeks of the first half of the financial year".
Analysts were encouraged by the strong numbers, although Donal O'Neill at Goodbody in Dublin said: "I wouldn't 
extrapolate too much of that into the second half," pointing out that the lift to bookings was helped by the cold 
weather.
The weak pound has hurt the company's performance, reducing income by an expected £30m-£35m, the company 
said.
Ms McCall also said that easyJet, which is considering a big aircraft order , had decided to exercise options on 
three Airbus A320 jets while it continued its deliberations.
EasyJet narrows range of forecast losses after late Easter bookings
An order would follow deals by rival Ryanair for Boeing current-generation aircraft - as opposed to the newer, more 
fuel-efficient models that easyJet is after - and by Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa and Lion Air for A320 neos, the US 
aerospace manufacturer's greener model, which is expected to enter general service in two years.
Any significant order is likely to meet opposition from Sir Stelios HajiIoannou , easyJet's founder and still its biggest 
shareholder, who is concerned that new aircraft will undermine the company's strong financial performance of 
recent years.
But analysts warned that easyJet might need to act quickly if it wanted at least some of the new aircraft within the 
next four or five years.
Shares in the carrier declined 6.38 per cent by the close of trading in London to £10.27, partially offsetting a 5 per 
cent rise over the past two weeks in the run-up to yesterday's trading statement.

The ISEQ tumbled below the 3,900 mark this morning amid growing uncertainty about the pace of recovery in the 
economy and concern about the US labour market.
The index fell 75.23 points to 3,836.50.
European stock indices fell yesterday as ECB President Mario Draghi gave no clear hint of additional stimulus 
measures. Irish data showed unemployment falling to 14pc in March, down from 15pc in early 2012. Industrial 
production rose 0.4pc in February, down 0.2pc on the year but up 5.6pc three-month on three-month. But the 
Central Bank this morning dropped its GDP forecast for the Irish economy for 2013 slightly, citing global headwinds.
Ryanair stocks fell 19c to E5.85. In its pre-close trading update, easyJet narrowed the range of guidance for H1 
(PBT now -£60-65m; previous guidance -£50-75m). easyJet is now guiding revenue per seat growth at constant 
currency for the six months to the end of March up c.8.5pc, marginally ahead of the guidance issued in January 
2013 (previous guidance +6 to +8pc), driven in part by stronger-than-anticipated late bookings in the run-up to 
Easter. easyJet's first-half revenue per seat growth was approximately 1.5 pp higher due to the timing of Easter, 
which fell on March 31st, a week earlier than in 2012. Aer Lingus March traffic statistics revealed a short-haul traffic 
decrease of 1pc and a long-haul increase of 12.6pc. Group load factor rose 4.1pc, in keeping with recent months for 
the company. This consisted of long-haul load factor up 2.4 percentage points to 84.4pc and the short-haul load 
factor up 4.7 percentage points to 77.3pc. Shares in the airline dipped 2c to E1.37.

Ryanair is to launch its 13th destination from the airport to Malaga in Spain.
The launch of Ryanair's new weekly service to Malaga brings to six the number of sun destinations now available

airport in 2013.
Weekly flights to popular hotspots such as Alicante, Faro, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Tenerife are already 
proving hugely popular with holidaymakers from the region and the addition of a new weekly service to Malaga in 
the Costa Del Sol provides even more choice for those looking for some badly needed sunshine, the airport 
operators said.
Commenting on the launch of the Malaga service, Maria Macken, Sales and Marketing Manager, Ryanair, said 
"Ryanair is delighted to welcome passengers on board its new service from Ireland West Knock to Malaga. Ryanair 
will offer passengers in the West and North West a choice of 6 Spanish destinations this summer as well as Faro 
making it Ryanair's biggest ever summer sun schedule from the West of Ireland".

Ryanair is to launch its 13th destination from the airport to Malaga in Spain.
The launch of Ryanair's new weekly service to Malaga brings to six the number of sun destinations now available 
from Ireland West Airport Knock with the new service generating an additional 13,000 passengers through the 
airport in 2013.
Weekly flights to popular hotspots such as Alicante, Faro, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Tenerife are already 
proving hugely popular with holidaymakers from the region and the addition of a new weekly service to Malaga in 
the Costa Del Sol provides even more choice for those looking for some badly needed sunshine, the airport 
operators said.

IAG Orders 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners For British Airways
IAG Orders 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners For British Airways

(RTTNews) - International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A. (BAY.L, BAIRY.PK, IAG.L) Thursday said it has 
reached an agreement with Boeing Co. (BA) on new longhaul aircraft for the group's fleet, including conversion of 
some existing Boeing 787 Dreamliners options into firm orders.
IAG has decided to convert 18 existing Boeing 787s options into firm orders for British Airways. They will be used to 
replace some of the airline's Boeing 747-400 aircraft between 2017 and 2021. British Airways already has 24 
Boeing 787s on order.
IAG's decision comes at a critical time for Boeing, which is trying to resolve some battery issues related to its 787 
Dreamliner that have led to the grounding of those planes. In late March, the 787 Dreamliner did a test flight after 
installing a new battery system.
For Iberia, IAG has reached agreement with Boeing to secure commercial terms and delivery slots that could result 
in an order for Boeing 787s. Firm orders will be made when Iberia is read to go profitable and reduces costs.
British Airways' 787s will be powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. The engine order includes a 
comprehensive maintenance package with total care agreement, IAG noted.
Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive, said: "The aircraft offers a step change in fuel burn efficiency versus our existing 
aircraft with improvements in fuel cost per seat of more than 20 per cent. New technology engines and improved 
aerodynamics will lower fuel burn leading to reduced carbon and NOx emissions.''
British Airways has 118 wide-bodied longhaul aircraft in its fleet with 42 aircraft already ordered. These ordered 
aircraft include 12 A380s, 24 B787s, six B777-300ERs.
Iberia has 31 wide-bodied longhaul aircraft in its fleet with six A330 aircraft already ordered.
Last month, Boeing had received a commitment from Ireland-based low cost carrier Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, 
RYA.L) for 175 Next-Generation 737-800 aircraft. The deal, when finalized, will be worth $15.6 billion at list prices.
IAG.L fell 2.5 percent on Wednesday to close at 254.20 pence.

Highlight: Ryanair has entered into a new collective agreement with all its cabin crew, which will result in pay 
increases and favorable rostering arrangements across the airline, as well as new pilot agreements at the majority 
of those Ryanair bases whose long term pay deals were due to expire in April 2013.
Body
Following negotiations between Ryanair and cabin crew representatives, using its collective bargaining structures, 
cabin crew at all Ryanair bases have voted to accept a four-year agreement which, from April 1, 2013, will deliver: 
Average pay increases of 10% over four years; Pay increases for all cabin crew groups including supervisors and 
junior crew; Maintenance of a stable 'home every night' roster, practically unique in European aviation; and 
Increases in supervisory and other allowances. Ryanair has also negotiated new five-year agreements with pilots at 
its Alicante, Bristol, Cork, East Midlands, Luton and Shannon bases (replacing existing agreements which were due 
to expire in April 2013) which, from April 1, 2013, will deliver: Pay increases of up to 10% over five years; A five day 
on, four day off roster; and Allowance and pension increases. 
Ryanair pilots at its Manchester and Valencia bases have also negotiated a five day on, four day off roster prior to 
the conclusion of their existing five-year agreement. Ryanair looks forward to negotiating new agreements at its 
other bases as and when their existing five year agreements finish over the next three years. Head of 
communications at Ryanair, Robin Kiely said: "These agreements recognise the outstanding productivity delivered 
by Ryanair's people, whose hard work and dedication is key to Ryanair's ability to expand and grow by offering 
more competition, ultra-low prices and a greater choice of routes."

Length: 414 words
Highlight: Latam's prefunded bond.
Body
The US Ex-Im bond programme has been remarkably successful for Boeing encouraging many non-US airlines to 
access the capital markets.
In spring 2012 the North American export credit agency launched its prefunded bond product allowing airlines for 
the first time to issue a note before the delivery of the aircraft.
This helped airlines to ensure the availability of financing for future deliveries and lock in financing costs in advance.
JP Morgan had the distinction of arranging the first of these financings, which was part of a wider mandate the bank 
had with Latam Airlines. On July 11 the bank arranged a $299 million bond issuance on behalf of Latam that 
refinanced bank funding for the delivery of two 767s, as well as prefunding two additional 767s that were scheduled 
to deliver in July and August 2012.
The proceeds of the prefunded bond were placed in a pledged account until the delivery of the aircraft. The deal 
achieved an extremely competitive coupon of 1.9% &#162;&,¬&(EURO)oe at the time the lowest coupon rate for a 
US Ex-Im-backed 12-year deal.
This was a slick bond issuance that was oversubscribed by investors. On a spread basis the Latam deal priced at 
78.8 basis points, easily exceeding lending rates at the time offered by commercial banks. Most importantly, the 
deal execution went well, creating a healthy precedent in the market.
This award recognizes the innovation offered by the US Ex-Im team in creating the product but also the success of 
both Latam and JP Morgan is setting a healthy benchmark in the market with this crucial first deal. The prefunded 
bond product has subsequently been used by other airlines, including Ryanair and Emirates, and later again by 
Latam.
Michael Clare, managing director and head of government and transportation finance at JP Morgan, says: "When 
Latam approached JP Morgan to structure a $1.06 billion Ex-Im Bank-guaranteed transaction covering 12 Boeing 
aircraft, our solution included a revolving commitment with multiple capital market take outs, while keeping the 
structure simple and efficient. In structuring the first-ever prefunded transaction, Latam was able to access the 
capital markets and minimize reliance on the bank backstop.

Using the Charlie Brown rating system, which European shares were the heroes during the first quarter and which 
were the goats? It was certainly a tricky time to pick stocks. The Euro Stoxx index was up only 2 per cent and its 
laboured progress mirrored the zigzag across Charlie Brown's shirt. Sentiment, too, was all over the place, starting 
the year fairly buoyant, then suddenly being walloped by Cyprus at the end of the quarter.
Nor did the sectors that finished as heroes appear to have much in common. Healthcare (defensive) names rose 
alongside financial services (cyclical), as did consumer products (defensive) and media (defensive). Sure, there 
were the classic rebound stocks that had suffered previously such as 3i, Bank of Ireland, Telefónica and Repsol. 
But investors would be forgiven for asking why many of the other names topped the rankings. EADS, for example, 
up 30 per cent, has been shooting the lights out ever since its "transformational" deal with BAE crashed and burnt. 
And who would have thought that housebuilders in the UK would have been given such a gift from the 
government's 2013 Budget ?
Retailers such as Carrefour, up 13 per cent, also did pretty well, although conditions remain tough. Investors 
obviously found the French retailer's turnround efforts encouraging.
Most surprising of all, three airlines, IAG, easyJet and Ryanair make the top 20 performers despite being, well, 
airline stocks. Warren Buffett eat your heart out.
And what about the goats? Mining names such as Rio Tinto had a nightmare as investors worried about the outlook 
for commodity prices and China . Few will be feeling sorry for the likes of London-listed miner Kazakhmys, down 
almost 50 per cent, or the National Bank of Greece.
Still, TNT Express probably feels a tad hard done by after the European Commission blocked its acquisition by 
UPS. ArcelorMittal shares, meanwhile, cannot seem to stop falling. And if investors thought Volkswagen looked 
cheap at the start of the year on 6.3 times forward earnings, they are now in the unfortunate position of holding a 
stock worth a further 10 per cent less while at the same time being slightly more expensive.
The lesson for investors from all this is the same as it ever was. Pick and hold individual stocks on their merits 
relative to valuation. Or buy an index fund.

(RTTNews) - The UK market is modestly higher on Thursday, even as concerns about the debt crisis in Europe 
continue to weigh on investor sentiment, after Germany's unemployment unexpectedly increased.
Cypriot banks reopened for business after being closed since March 16. The Cypriot government has announced 
limits on withdrawals and credit card transactions in an attempt to prevent the nation's financial sector from 
collapsing.
Germany's unemployment increased 13,000 in March from the prior month, the Federal Labor Agency said. It was 
forecast to fall by 2,000. The jobless rate remained unchanged at seasonally adjusted 6.9 percent in March, data 
showed. The rate came in line with economists' expectations.
Efforts are on in Italy to form a government. Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani said Wednesday that he 
would not attempt to put together a coalition government, stating that only an "insane" person would want to govern 
the country in the current environment.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is losing 0.17 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, is adding 0.05 percent.
The FTSE 100 is advancing 0.2 percent.
InterContinental Hotels Group is gaining 3.2 percent. The firm agreed to sell its London Park Lane Hotel to 
Constellation Hotel UK S.A., for gross cash proceeds of 301.5 million pounds.
Johnson Matthey, which completed the purchase of Formox AB for 107 million pounds, is gaining 2.6 percent.
Sweeteners manufacturer Tate & Lyle said in a trading update that it continues to expect to deliver modest progress 
for full year ending March 31. The company said its performance has been solid and in line with its expectations. 
The stock is up 2 percent.
Ryanair is up 1.8 percent. Citigroup raised the stock to ''Buy'' from ''Neutral.''
Antofagasta is losing close to 3 percent. Eurasian Natural Resources is losing 2.8 percent and Vedanta Resources 
is falling 1.8 percent.
UK Market Modestly Higher
Elsewhere in Europe, the German DAX and the French CAC 40 are losing fractionally, while Switzerland's SMI is 
above the unchanged line.
Across Asia/Pacific, markets fell amid renewed worries about Europe's debt crisis as well as the global growth 
outlook. China's Shanghai Composite Index lost 2.8 percent and Japan's Nikkei 225 retreated 1.3 percent. 
Australia's All Ordinaries slid 0.5 percent while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.7 percent.
In the U.S., futures point to a lower open on Wall Street. In the previous session, stocks ended on a mixed note 
amid persistent concerns over Cyprus. The Dow slipped 0.2 percent and the S&P 500 edged down marginally, 
while the tech-heavy Nasdaq managed to climb into positive territory, inching up 0.1 percent.
In the commodity space, crude for May delivery is falling $0.05 to $96.53 per barrel and June gold is losing $1.8 to 
$1605.4 a troy ounce.

(RTTNews) - The majority of the European markets finished in the green on Thursday, ahead of the long Easter 
holiday weekend. Cypriot banks reopened for business Thursday, after being closed since March 16. The Cypriot 
government announced limits on withdrawals and credit card transactions in an attempt to prevent the nation's 
financial sector from collapsing. Investors were encouraged by the lack of panic in Cyprus and the relative calm of 
those waiting in line at the nation's banks.
Italian Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani said Wednesday that he would not attempt to put together a 
coalition government, stating that only an "insane" person would want to govern the country in the current 
environment.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks increased by 0.34 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, added 0.40 percent.
The DAX of Germany climbed by 0.08 percent and the CAC 40 of France advanced by 0.53 percent. The FTSE 100 
of the U.K. rose by 0.38 percent and the SMI of Switzerland gained 0.43 percent.
In Frankfurt, Commerzbank finished up by 0.79 percent, while Deutsche Bank lost 0.34 percent.

European Market Climbed After Banks Reopened In Cyprus
Ryanair dipped by 0.18 percent, after Citigroup upgraded the stock to ''Buy'' from ''Neutral.''
National Grid climbed by 1.86 percent, after it announced a new dividend policy.
Mining stocks were under pressure Thursday. Antofagasta dropped by 3.85 percent and Anglo American fell by 
1.97 percent. Vedanta Resources declined by 2.73 percent and BHP Billiton lost 1.36 percent.
Germany's retail sales increased at a notably slower pace in February, while economists expected sales to 
decrease modestly, latest data showed Thursday. Retail sales turnover, in real terms, increased a seasonally 
adjusted 0.4 percent month-on-month in February, notably slower than the 3 percent gain seen in January, the 
Federal Statistical Office said. Economists had forecast sales to decrease by 0.6 percent.
Germany's unemployment increased unexpectedly in March as companies failed to create more jobs, while retail 
sales increased in February for the second month reflecting the ongoing positive momentum in consumer spending.
The number of unemployed increased 13,000 from February to 2.94 million, the Federal Labor Agency said 
Thursday. It was forecast to fall by 2,000. The jobless figures for February were revised from a decline of 3,000 to 
show no change.
Nonetheless, the jobless rate remained near a post-unification low, at a seasonally adjusted 6.9 percent in March. It 
has been at 6.9 percent since October 2012 and matched economists' expectations.
British consumer confidence remained unchanged for a third consecutive month in March, suggesting that the 
sentiment is stabilizing above the very deep trough seen during most of 2012, a survey by GfK NOP revealed 
Thursday. The confidence index remained at -26 for a third straight month in March, but was five points higher than 
in the same month last year.
An indicator of British service sector output rose 0.3 percent month-on-month in January, the latest figures from the 
Office for National Statistics showed Thursday. The figure matched economists' forecast. In January, the services 
index rose 0.8 percent on an annual basis.
House prices in the U.K. rose for the first time in thirteen months in March, supported by strong buyer demand, but 
the market outlook remained uncertain, a survey by the Nationwide Building Society showed Thursday. Home 
prices rose 0.8 percent year-on-year in March after recording negative or zero movement in the past 12 months. 
Economists had forecast a 0.9 percent increase. The typical U.K. home is now worth GBP 164,630.
U.S. economic activity in the final three months of 2012 increased at a faster rate than previously estimated, 
according to a report released by the Commerce department on Thursday. The report showed that GDP increased 
at an annual rate of 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the previously reported 0.1 percent increase.
Despite the upward revision, the pace of GDP growth still came in below economist estimates for an increase of 0.6 
percent.
First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits increased by more than expected in the week ended March 23rd, 
according to a report released by the Labor Department on Thursday. The report showed that initial jobless claims 
rose to 357,000, an increase of 16,000 from the previous week's revised figure of 341,000.
Economists had expected jobless claims to edge up to 340,000 from the 336,000 originally reported for the previous 
week.
After a strong start to the year, growth in Chicago-area business activity saw a much bigger than expected 
slowdown in the month of March, according to a report released by the Institute for Supply Management - Chicago 
on Thursday.
European Market Climbed After Banks Reopened In Cyprus
The ISM Chicago said its business barometer fell to 52.4 in March from 56.8 in February, although a reading above 
50 indicates an increase in business activity. Economists had been expecting the business barometer to edge down 
to 56.1.

Body
Ryanair today said it has reached agreement with pilots and cabin crew on pay that will see an average pay rise of 
10pc over four years and a new work rostering arrangement.
The deal, the airline said, will result in pay increases and favourable rostering arrangements across the airline, as 
well as new pilot agreements at the majority of those Ryanair bases whose long term pay deals were due to expire 
in April this year.
Following negotiations between Ryanair and cabin crew representatives, using its long-established collective 
bargaining structures, cabin crew at all Ryanair bases have voted to accept a four-year agreement which, from 1st 
April 2013.
A Ryanair spokesman said this will deliver average pay increases of 10pc over four years for all cabin crew groups 
including supervisors and junior crew. He said it will see the maintenance of a stable 'home every night' roster, 
"practically unique in European aviation" and an increases in supervisory and other allowances. Ryanair has also 
negotiated new five-year agreements with pilots at its Alicante, Bristol, Cork, East Midlands, Luton and Shannon 
bases (replacing existing agreements which were due to expire in April this year) from 1st April. It said this will 
deliver pay increases of up to 10pc over five years, a five day on, four day off roster and allowance and pension 
increases. Ryanair pilots at its Manchester and Valencia bases have also negotiated a five day on, four day off 
roster prior to the conclusion of their existing five-year agreement. Ryanair said it will negotiate new agreements at 
its other bases as and when their existing five year agreements finish over the next three years. "These agreements 
recognise the outstanding productivity delivered by Ryanair's people, whose hard work and dedication is key to 
Ryanair's ability to expand and grow by offering more competition, ultra-low prices and a greater choice of routes," 
said Ryanair's Robin Kiely. "It is a considerable success for Ryanair's cabin crew and pilots to secure pay increases 
and favourable rosters at a time when unions in Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK are currently

negotiating job cuts, pay cuts and pension cuts. These contrasting circumstances demonstrate yet again the 
success of Ryanair's business model and of its policy of dealing directly with cabin crew and pilots through the long-

cutting jobs and slashing pay and benefits, Ryanair will continue to offer stability, job security and outstanding 
promotional opportunities as the airline grows to carry over 100 million passengers per annum by 2019, with the 
acquisition of 175 new Boeing 737-800s," said Robin Kiely.

ORDERS DOMINIC PERRY LONDON
Big month for the big two
Airbus extends lead over rival in fight for sales of re-engined single-aisles while Boeing nets crucial order from 
Ryanair
March has turned into a busy month for the big two airframers. Undeterred by a subdued economic outlook, four 
airlines have unveiled commitments for a whopping 591 narrowbody jetliners in the space of a week.
The plans revealed by Lufthansa and Ryanair to order 100 Airbus A320-family aircraft, including 70 Neos, and 175 
current-generation Boeing 737s respectively, come as little surprise, but the real interest in the flurry of deals during 
the past week came from fast-growing carriers Turkish Airlines and Indonesia's Lion Air.
Turkish has ordered 82 A320s, comprising 25 current-generation models and a further 57 of the re-engined 
A320neo family. Lion, already a 737 customer, added to its order portfolio with a commitment for 234 Airbus jets, 60 
A320s and a further 174 Neos in a deal worth $24 billion at list prices.
SECOND DEFEAT
The Turkish order represents a second defeat for Boeing in the country, with budget carrier and 737 operator 
Pegasus Airlines defecting in December 2012 to the A320neo over the rival 737 Max.
While Turkish Airlines is a large 737 operator, and still has several 737-800s and -900s on order, Airbus says the 
agreement is the largest contract placed by a Turkish carrier - eclipsing the deal for 75 firm aircraft signed by 
Pegasus.
ORDERS DOMINIC PERRY LONDON.
However, Chris Seymour, head of market analysis at Flightglobal's Ascend consultancy arm, believes there may yet 
be hope for Boeing in Turkey as the airline moves ahead with its rapid expansion plans: "Turkish Airlines already 
has products from both manufacturers. I wouldn't be surprised to see both types there in future."
Lion Air, meanwhile, has even more ambitious designs for its future. Its purchase of the A320s, on top of its 2012 
commitment for 201 of the 737 Max, will support the establishment of several new carriers in the Asia-Pacific 
region, including Malaysia's Malindo Airways and full-service Indonesian carrier Batik Air, both of which commence 
operations in the coming weeks.
But although Seymour again downplays the partial defection from Boeing to Airbus, saying Lion plans to build a big 
enough fleet to make operating two types "less of an issue", the deal does break Seattle's stranglehold on the 
Indonesian market.
More broadly, the recent flurry of activity has helped Airbus cement its lead over Boeing in the battle for re-engined 
narrowbody sales. Toulouse now lists 2,109 firm orders for A320neo-family aircraft, while Boeing's 737 Max - at 
least for the moment - languishes on 1,185 orders, representing a market share of a touch less than 36%.
Richard Aboulafia, vice-president analysis at Virginia consultancy Teal Group, says Boeing will be concerned if its 
market share continues to dip below the 40% threshold, "but it's just too early to know".
Airbus has a head-start on its rival, launching the Neo ahead of the 737 Max and with entry into service scheduled 
18 months in advance of Boeing's jet too. However, Aboulafia says Airbus also benefits from offering an engine 
choice on the Neo, with airlines able to opt for the CFM International Leap-1A or Pratt & Whitney's PW1100G 
geared turbofan. Boeing, though, has chosen to maintain CFM as the sole engine provider on the 737, offering the 
Leap-1B on the Max. "I think the industry is still processing this massive divergence in [engine] philosophy," says 
Aboulafia. "I wouldn't bet against Boeing and CFM, but on the other hand I understand the desire [of airlines] to 
hedge the risk." Crucially, none of the recent Neo orders features an engine selection, indicating the carriers' 
caution.
PRODUCTION RATES
Although attention has largely focused on the re-engined element of the recent orders, almost half - or 290 units - of 
the recent deals were for current-generation aircraft. Aboulafia thinks this is driven by the airframers deciding to 
keep production rates high to avoid a gap to the re-engined variants and "discounting the hell" out of those aircraft.
Evidence of that keen pricing, he says, is shown by the fact they are "shifting large numbers" of current-generation 
aircraft to the "lowest-cost carriers".
"These are fuel-sensitive carriers and they should be thinking about saving 10-12% by waiting for the Neo and Max 
unless, of course, they are getting an extremely good price on the current model."

Highlight: Ryanair has signed an agreement with the Boeing Company to purchase 175 new Next Generation 737-
800 airplanes.
Body
When finalised, the deal will be worth nearly $15.6 billion at current list prices, and will allow Ryanair to grow its 
airline to more than 400 airplanes, serving more than 100 million passengers per year across Europe by the end of 
the delivery stream in 2018. These Boeing airplanes will create more than 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and 
engineers at Ryanair's aircraft bases across Europe. Approximately 75 of these new aircraft will replace some of 
Ryanair's existing fleet of 305 Boeing 737s. These airplanes will allow Ryanair to grow its low-cost airline service by 
about 5 percent per annum over the next several years, taking Ryanair's traffic to over 100 million passengers by 
March 2019, the airline said. Announcing the order, Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary, said: "Ryanair is pleased to 
sign this agreement with Boeing to purchase 175 new 737-800 jets, which will expand our fleet to over 400 units, 
creating over 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers, while allowing us to grow our low-cost airline 
service by about 5 percent per annum over the next several years and take our traffic to 100 million passengers by 
March 2019." Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO, Ray Conner, said: "This purchase agreement is an 
amazing testament to the value that the Next Generation 737 brings to Ryanair. 
We are pleased that the Next-Generation 737, as the most efficient, most reliable large single-aisle airplane flying 
today, has been and will continue to be the cornerstone of the Ryanair fleet. Our partnership with this great 
European low-cost carrier is of the utmost importance to everyone at The Boeing Company and I could not be more 
proud to see it extended for years to come."

A320neo family. Lion, already a 737 customer, added to its order portfolio with a commitment for 234 Airbus jets, 60 
A320s and a further 174 Neos in a deal worth $24 billion at list prices.
SECOND DEFEAT
The Turkish order represents a second defeat for Boeing in the country, with budget carrier and 737 operator 
Pegasus Airlines defecting in December 2012 to the A320neo over the rival 737 Max.
While Turkish Airlines is a large 737 operator, and still has several 737-800s and -900s on order, Airbus says the 
agreement is the largest contract placed by a Turkish carrier - eclipsing the deal for 75 firm aircraft signed by 
Pegasus.
However, Chris Seymour, head of market analysis at Flightglobal's Ascend consultancy arm, believes there may yet 
be hope for Boeing in Turkey as the airline moves ahead with its rapid expansion plans: "Turkish Airlines already 
has products from both manufacturers. I wouldn't be surprised to see both types there in future."

Lion Air, meanwhile, has even more ambitious designs for its future. Its purchase of the A320s, on top of its 2012 
commitment for 201 of the 737 Max, will support the establishment of several new carriers in the Asia-Pacific 
region, including Malaysia's Malindo Airways and full-service Indonesian carrier Batik Air, both of which commence 
operations in the coming weeks.
But although Seymour again downplays the partial defection from Boeing to Airbus, saying Lion plans to build a big 
enough fleet to make operating two types "less of an issue", the deal does break Seattle's stranglehold on the 
Indonesian market.
More broadly, the recent flurry of activity has helped Airbus cement its lead over Boeing in the battle for re-engined 
narrowbody sales. Toulouse now lists 2,109 firm orders for A320neo-family aircraft, while Boeing's 737 Max - at 
least for the moment - languishes on 1,185 orders, representing a market share of a touch less than 36%.
Richard Aboulafia, vice-president analysis at Virginia consultancy Teal Group, says Boeing will be concerned if its 
market share continues to dip below the 40% threshold, "but it's just too early to know".
Airbus has a head-start on its rival, launching the Neo ahead of the 737 Max and with entry into service scheduled 
18 months in advance of Boeing's jet too. However, Aboulafia says Airbus also benefits from offering an engine 
choice on the Neo, with airlines able to opt for the CFM International Leap-1A or Pratt & Whitney's PW1100G 
geared turbofan. Boeing, though, has chosen to maintain CFM as the sole engine provider on the 737, offering the 
Leap-1B on the Max. "I think the industry is still processing this massive divergence in [engine] philosophy," says 
Aboulafia. "I wouldn't bet against Boeing and CFM, but on the other hand I understand the desire [of airlines] to 
hedge the risk." Crucially, none of the recent Neo orders features an engine selection, indicating the carriers' 
caution.
PRODUCTION RATES
Although attention has largely focused on the re-engined element of the recent orders, almost half - or 290 units - of 
the recent deals were for current-generation aircraft. Aboulafia thinks this is driven by the airframers deciding to 
keep production rates high to avoid a gap to the re-engined variants and "discounting the hell" out of those aircraft.
Evidence of that keen pricing, he says, is shown by the fact they are "shifting large numbers" of current-generation 
aircraft to the "lowest-cost carriers".
"These are fuel-sensitive carriers and they should be thinking about saving 10-12% by waiting for the Neo and Max 
unless, of course, they are getting an extremely good price on the current model."

Last Tuesday, Ryanair signed the largest industrial order of any Irish company in the history of the Republic. By 
agreeing a $15.6 billion deal with Boeing for 175 new jets, Europe's largest low-cost carrier made a statement of 
intent. Despite a severe economic recession, and in a European economy riven by a dysfunctional financial system, 
such a huge investment decision reflects a high degree of confidence and financial strength with this Irish airline.
The airline industry backdrop to this contract helps explain why Ryanair is spending such large amounts. After a 
period of rapid consolidation, the United States now has four airlines that account for more than 90 per cent of 
short-haul point-to-point traffic.
In Europe, with a liberalised air travel market similar in size to that of the US, just five carriers have a 50 per cent 
share, and the remainder is spread across a fragmented group of more than 30 airlines.
Ryanair competes in this single European air travel market with unit costs and air fares that are structurally below 
all of its competitors. Using industry measures, such as cost per passenger or cost per available seat kilometre, it is 
clear that Ryanair has an advantage (excluding fuel) as its competitors have unit costs of between 60 and 250 per 
cent higher.
This explains why passenger volumes have grown from 16 million in 2002 to 79 million in 2012 despite a period of 
record oil prices and bouts of economic weakness. At present, Ryanair's share of short-haul travel in Europe is 
between 12 and 15 per cent, depending on how the market is defined.
This traffic is spread over 1,500 routes that operate to 179 airports, of which 57 are bases where aircraft overnight. 
Alongside this backbone, a further 75-plus airports are in dialogue with Ryanair to open up new routes. This is the 
canvas on which Ryanair will now deploy these 175 new aircraft between 2014 and 2018, in an expansion phase 
that will add more than 3,000 jobs to the business.
Ryanair 's $15.6bn flight plan
The plan outlined last week is structured to deliver sustained but conservative growth rates that ensure profits 
increase as the airline expands. Although 175 new planes will be delivered, an estimated 70 older aircraft will be 
returned to lessors or sold on the open market which, in turn, will keep annual capacity growth at 3-5 per cent.
This compares with yearly growth rates of 10-20 per cent when Ryanair was a smaller business and it reflects 
prudent development from a much larger base.
However, extensive flexibility exists with this new order. The used aircraft sale plans can be accelerated or delayed 
and, in addition, Ryanair has aircraft which have been grounded in winter months over recent years. These can be 
used quickly if profitable market opportunities arise.
This aspect of the deal carries the greatest potency. Having strapped on an order for 175 planes, Ryanair can 
patiently carve out a growing market share while having the scope and aircraft to move quickly if significant short-
term opportunities appear.
In early 2012, the Spanish airline Spanair and the Hungarian state carrier Malev collapsed under severe financial 
stress. Ryanair moved quickly to deploy aircraft to Barcelona and Budapest, the respective home bases of those 
airlines. These are prime examples of the organic growth potential that exists for Ryanair as other troubled airlines 
struggle to survive in a hyper-competitive market.
Choosing the Boeing 737-800 as Ryanair's weapon of choice was also a carefully analysed decision. Alternative 
Airbus aircraft or different variants of the Boeing 737 were plausible options. However, the 737-800 had a number 
of key attributes that made this a no-brainer:
*the -800 has 189 seats, which compares with the 180-seat Airbus A320s that are typical in the fleets competing 
with Ryanair. This alone offers a 5 per cent per seat cost advantage;
*the existing fleet of 305 737-800s has a logistical, crew and maintenance infrastructure built around it which is 
efficient, safe and reliable. Adding another 175 identical aircraft to that base can be executed with very low risk;
*the 737-800 has evolved since a major Ryanair 2002 contract by adding winglets and a new aerodynamic package 
which has improved its fuel efficiency by over 5 per cent;
*the 737-800 is a lighter aircraft, bringing fuel efficiency and operating cost advantages.
The timing of this order is also noteworthy. It was widely known that Ryanair and Boeing failed in negotiations four 
years ago. This time, factors that helped close the gap between both sides included:
*further strengthening of Ryanair's balance sheet which gave it the financial muscle to contemplate conservatively a 
larger deal;
*Boeing's challenges with the 787 programme;
*the end-of-line status of existing generation 737s as a new Max version approaches service entry in 2017;
*a succession of Airbus narrow-body wins with traditional Boeing customers including Norwegian Air Shuttle, 
Pegasus Airlines and THY in Turkey and Lion Air in Indonesia.
These ingredients helped formulate a deal that delivered pricing "not dissimilar" to that achieved in Ryanair's last 
significant Boeing deal, in 2005.
Having secured a stream of competitively-priced aircraft that allows passenger volume to rise from 79 million to 
about 100 million by 2019, Ryanair has laid out a defined growth plan.
Beyond that, Ryanair has hinted at an interest in the Boeing 737 Max, an evolution of the existing generation 
equipment with all-new engines that promise fuel efficiency gains of more than 10 per cent. This aeroplane will not 
Ryanair 's $15.6bn flight plan
fly until 2017 and Ryanair is unlikely to be a launch customer, given the challenges related to bringing new aircraft 
into service.
However, if Max enters service in 2017, it will be a proven aircraft in 2019 by which time Ryanair will explore options 
for additional growth. If a Max deal can be done (and this is crucial) at prices that protect and enhance Ryanair's 
competitiveness, it raises the prospect of another step-down in unit costs (helped by fuel efficiency) that gives 
Ryanair an even greater competitive edge in the short-haul air travel market.
How big can Ryanair get? History shows that air travel demand grows at a multiple of GDP in developed 
economies. If we assume an anaemic 2 per cent annual euro GDP growth in the next decade, then the short-haul 
market will expand by over 30 per cent.
That implies the short-haul passenger market could reach almost 700 million. Ryanair's cost advantage and 
financial strength suggest that a 20 per cent share of that market is not implausible (its US peer, Southwest Airlines, 
has a 20 per cent market share) and this equates to a passenger volume of 140 million -- or 75 per cent larger than 
the airline's existing scale.
Growth of this magnitude will offer a business opportunity for airports throughout Europe. After a period of volume 
contraction, exacerbated by a deep recession, Irish airports can compete for part of this growth too.
Whether or not Ryanair traffic expands to and from Ireland will depend on how aggressively its airports compete for 
new business. Ultimately, that potential will hinge on delivering the cost competitiveness which lies at the root of 
Ryanair's success.
In finalising this order with Boeing, Ryanair has laid out a clear and sustainable growth strategy for its shareholders 
and employees. Its debt-free balance sheet and high-margin cashflows ensure that the order will be financed 
without recourse to shareholders.
Even after funding these aircraft, potential room exists to consider share buybacks, dividends and acquisitions as a 
means of creating equity value. But it is organic growth that has been put front and centre by this largest-ever deal 
in corporate Ireland.

Chutzpah, vision and Ireland 's biggest deal
Chutzpah, vision and Ireland's biggest deal
Sunday Business Post

Body
Last week saw the largest corporate transaction involving an Irish company ever. Yet it got precious little press 
coverage. Indeed, during the week, rather than going big on this huge business story, RTE twice carried a story 
about the company, Ryanair, being fined a modest EUR 375,000 by the Dutch consumer agency, rather than 
focusing on the $16 billion deal announced last Tuesday.
Quite why Ryanair's modest woes rather than its major triumphs tend to get more media coverage is a matter for 
another discussion, but what is clear is that the deal to buy 175 planes, at a list price of $16 billion, represents an 
enormous vote of confidence by Ryanair in its future.
It has been clear for a while that Ryanair's aggressive expansion could only be sustained by expanding its fleet -- 
but there is expansion and there is expansion. This constitutes a mega deal and it tells us as much about the state 
of the airline industry, and the state of the seller as it does about the chutzpah of the buyer. Details emerging 
suggest that Ryanair has got the deal of the century.
Its press statement said that it paid a price which is "not dissimilar" to the price it paid for jets in 2005. Back then, 
Ryanair paid only 53 per cent of the list price.
Ryanair won't tell us what the planes cost this time around, but if it is a similar deal, it implies that Ryanair has 
secured 175 planes for the price of about 85 or 90. The list price for a 737 is in the region of $85 -$95 million if a 
rich company wanted to buy a single one. The rumour is that O'Leary got his planes for half that.
This move would be yet another example of Warren Buffett's investment mantra which Ryanair follows of "buying 
when everyone is selling and selling when everyone is buying". This strategy was best evidenced by Michael 
O'Leary heading to Seattle to meet Boeing and place an order days after 9/11 in 2001.
He is at a similar game now, sensing Boeing's weakness and playing his hand.
Chutzpah, vision and Ireland 's biggest deal
This time around, Boeing is weak because of the problems you might have read about, with the launch of its new 
787 Dreamliner jet. This is supposed to be the new big thing in long-haul travel, but there have been all sorts of 
glitches. The selling point of this new jet is that it is built in one piece, so there is no need for rivets joining bits of the 
plane together.
This brings down its weight and, as a result, will save between 18 and 20 per cent on fuel costs. But the problem is 
the electronics on test flights haven't been up to scratch, delaying its launch. Therefore Boeing is in need of good 
news to counter this PR problem.
The second reason Boeing needs a good news story is that it is being hammered by Airbus in the short-haul 
market, the market in which Ryanair reigns supreme. This is because Airbus engines are designed with bigger fans, 
which are more fuel-efficient than Boeing's. As a result, Airbus is out-performing Boeing by as much as eight to one 
in the new order business. But, of course, Airbus planes are more expensive and, when you are dominating your 
rival, you don't discount your prices, which is why Ryanair is dealing with Boeing, which is now at its weakest.
The other reason Ryanair got a good price is that it is buying the last big batch of an old model of plane. This, as 
you can imagine, was hugely significant for Boeing. Boeing is upgrading its planes and is going to unveil a new, 
more fuel-efficient model by 2018. Ryanair knows this and so has come in and bought all the old stock. What 
manufacturer would not like a deal whereby a client came in and lifted most of the model the manufacturer itself 
was intent on phasing out?
So what's Ryanair's risk?
Well the risks are two-fold. The first is that the airline will be left in eight years time with an outdated fleet, which is 
less fuel-efficient than the new models of both Boeing and Airbus. The second is that the market will dip and it will 
be left with too many planes. On the first concern, Ryanair knows that it will have less fuel-efficient planes in the 
future, but its management is taking the view that it is better to have capacity today, take advantage now and worry 
about ten years' time in ten years' time. They have probably learned from Boeing's 787 experiences.
There is a huge difference between talking about a new model and actually delivering a new model. So Ryanair 
may be gambling that Boeing will slip up and it will be in pole position.
The second concern that the market may dip is something that Ryanair has obviously decided is a small risk. Unlike 
other airlines, it has the cash now and it is going for it. For example, Ryanair made EUR 750 million in cash last 
year. The difference between this cash take and the EUR 500 million of recorded profits is depreciation on planes.
Ryanair calculates that, after this deal, it will have the capacity to drive costs even lower and squeeze its 
competitors. According to its press release, Ryanair will end up -- after retiring planes and giving back leased 
planes -- with about 410 planes in total, up from the present fleet of 305 planes.
The company has said that it intends to increase passenger numbers by 3 per cent per annum for the next four 
years, bringing total passengers flown from today's 80 million to 105 million by adding four to five million 
passengers per year.
To put this expansion in context, adding four million passengers per year would mean that Ryanair would create an 
airline the total size of Aer Lingus every two years.
The model is the same, lower fares than the rest, based on lower costs. In the Ryanair view, there are people who 
want to travel and will pay EUR 70 to go to destinations that most of those people never contemplated in the past.
The price, rather than the destination, drives the decision. This is quite different from most tourist boards, which 
claim that there are people who, for example, have always wanted to come to Dublin. Ryanair's counterclaim is no, 
there are people who want to travel for EUR 70 and, if they happen to go to Dublin, fine, but they will go to Aarhus 
in Denmark or Girona in Spain for that price too.
Chutzpah, vision and Ireland 's biggest deal
Once the airline creates a route, the evidence is that people reinforce the demand for Ryanair by telling mates. The 
initial route decision is validated by word of mouth by people saying: "I went to a great place last year for EUR 70, 
you should go too." Given its growth rates, it is hard to argue with Ryanair.
O'Leary obviously thinks that Europe is full of opportunity, with countries where people are still used to paying EUR 
200 for a seat he can provide at EUR 70. A quick look at the figures suggests that he is not wrong. Ryanair is the 
second-biggest airline in Greece, the biggest in Poland; it is strong in Germany and, unexpectedly, the second-
biggest airline in Morocco. It is growing rapidly in Scandinavia. This is also happening because there are lots of 
under-used airports.
Given that the Ryanair nightmare is for these shiny new Boeings to be stuck on the ground because of congestion, 
making no money for the airline, it's not surprising that it avoids the big airports. For the passenger, this is never 
ideal, but, given the way 80 million of us have responded to the Ryanair view of things, it is clear that we get over 
such inconveniences.
The biggest deal in Irish corporate history has been done by arguably the country's most audacious company, 
driven by its most single-minded leader. Now this is truly a good news story worth reporting.
Like it or loathe it, Ryanair is doing the business and, after last week's deal, it is doing it with a seriousness and an 
intent rarely seen -- not only in this country, but in any country.

The aviation industry strongly criticised George Osborne after the chancellor once again rejected its call for the 
abolition of air passenger duty.
The Budget confirmed the duty would increase in line with the retail prices index next month, and would do so again 
in April 2014.
It means that from next month the duty could add £94 to the price of a long-haul economy flight of more than 6,000 
miles and £188 to business and first-class tickets.
EasyJet, International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic said in a joint statement 
they were "very disappointed" at the planned increases in the duty for medium and long-haul flights. "These rises in 
air passenger duty show the emptiness of rhetoric on boosting exports to emerging economies and building the 
most competitive tax system in the world."
The four carriers published a report in February by PwC, the consultant, that found UK air passenger duty to be the 
highest tax of its type in the world.
The report concluded that abolishing the duty would boost gross domestic product by 0.45 per cent in its first year 
by expanding investment and exports, including earnings from foreign tourism.
But the Treasury disputed the analysis and the Budget red book confirmed the duty was expected to raise £2.9bn in 
revenue in 2013-14 and £3bn in 2014-15.
The Budget also confirmed the extension of the duty to business jets from next month, which is expected to raise 
£5m each year from 2013-14.
Patrick Margetson-Rushmore, chief executive of London Executive Aviation, a business jet operator, said the move 
might be seen as a "fat cat's tax", but added people using such aircraft were creating employment.

Hopes of a return to growth led Ryanair to a six-year high in an otherwise flat London market.
Analysts welcomed news this week that Ryanair had provisionally signed an order for 175 Boeing jets , extending 
its fleet to at least 375 aircraft by 2019.
While Ryanair management has ruled out a dividend for the next two years, analysts saw the possibility of a one-off 
payment coming earlier.
Ryanair's London-listed shares rose 2.1 per cent to EUR6.2, giving it a market value of EUR9bn. The stock is up 32 
per cent this year.
A directionless wider market left the FTSE 100 down 0.1 per cent, or 8.62 points, at 6,432.70.
Housebuilders were the top performers after the government extended its new-build mortgage subsidy .
Barratt Developments jumped 6.6 per cent to 255.6p and Taylor Wimpey gained 6.1 per cent to 90.9p.
Royal Bank of Scotland  led the blue-chip risers, up 2.3 per cent to 300.2p. Liberum Capital saw upside potential

Prospects of return to growth help propel Ryanair even higher

Body
Hopes of a return to growth led Ryanair to a six-year high in an otherwise flat London market.
Analysts welcomed news this week that Ryanair had provisionally signed an order for 175 Boeing jets , extending 
its fleet to at least 375 aircraft by 2019.
"Deliveries through 2014-2018 suggest Ryanair is now firmly a growth stock again," said Deutsche Bank. "This may 
cause a step-change in perception as the market has been viewing Ryanair as purely cash flow-generative and so 
growth adds a new angle to the story."
While Ryanair management has ruled out a dividend for the next two years, analysts saw the possibility of a one-off 
payment coming earlier.
Goodbody forecast Ryanair to generate more than EUR480m of free cash a year after aircraft costs between 2014 
and 2019. "This kind of cash generation after the impact of a significant aircraft order is nothing short of staggering," 
it said.
Ryanair's London-listed shares rose 2.1 per cent to EUR6.2, giving it a market value of EUR9bn. The stock is up 32 
per cent this year.
A directionless wider market left the FTSE 100 down 0.1 per cent, or 8.62 points, at 6,432.70.
Housebuilders were the top performers after the government extended its new-build mortgage subsidy .
Barratt Developments jumped 6.6 per cent to 255.6p and Taylor Wimpey gained 6.1 per cent to 90.9p.
Royal Bank of Scotland led the blue-chip risers, up 2.3 per cent to 300.2p. Liberum Capital saw upside potential in 
RBS of 15 per cent, arguing that a Bank of England Financial Policy Committee report due next week was likely to 
be more dovish than feared.
Prospects of return to growth help propel Ryanair even higher
Miners exposed to the steel industry continued to slide, matching iron ore's 15 per cent fall from highs.
BHP Billiton lost 1 per cent to £19.62 and Ferrexpo was down 4 per cent to 174.3p.
Gold miner Centamin jumped more than 20 per cent in the moments before a company update on an Egyptian 
court case that has challenged the validity of its mining licence.
Centamin's news was that the court had suspended enforcement of a ruling made last year. But the decision was 
not based on the merits of Centamin's appeal, which was likely to be several months away, and had no practical 
effect on the group's day-to-day operations, analysts said. The shares closed down 3.8 per cent at 56.5p.
Lonmin lost 3.8 per cent to 300p with UBS adding the platinum miner to its "least preferred" list. There was a 
"material risk" of industry strikes in South Africa when settlement talks between Amplats, unions and government 
end on March 30.
Compromise by Amplats on its plans to cut production would also be negative for platinum producers, UBS said. 
Analysts also noted the threat to platinum production from power cuts caused by a strikes at South Africa's coal 
mines.
Against that, Société Générale highlighted that the weak South African rand would cut Lonmin's cost of production 
and help boost its "razor thin margins"; a 10 per cent decline in the rand against the dollar lifts Lonmin's 2013 
earnings by 72 per cent, it said.
Greggs , the bakery, lost 8.3 per cent to 480p after its full-year results showed sales and margins had weakened.
Marks and Spencer was down 1.4 per cent to 392.4p as recent bid speculation gave way to worries that its clothes

THE AVIATION industry yesterday slammed the chancellor for refusing to cut air passenger duty (APD).
George Osborne said APD will rise at the rate of the retail prices index rate of inflation from 1 April and again in 
2014, as planned. He spurned calls from travel groups to give passengers a reprieve on the levy, which will from 
next month cost between £26 and £188 per flight in or out of the country.
"These rises in APD show the emptiness of rhetoric on boosting exports to emerging economies and building the 
most competitive tax system in the world," said the bosses of IAG, Ryanair, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic in a joint 
statement.
The Office of Budget Responsibility expects APD to raise £2.8bn this year, rising to £3.8bn by 2017-18 - a drop of 
£100m per year compared to its earlier forecast.

The ISEQ index headed towards the 4,000 level this morning with steady gains in a rally that could see it reach its 
highest level in five years.
By 12:45, the ISEQ was up 49.48 points to 3,986.08.
European shares extended gains today, with traders citing Greek media reports that Cyprus had reached a deal 
with Russia on the sale of Cyprus Popular Bank to Russian investors as the reason for the rise. The pan-European 
FTSEurofirst 300 index rose as much as 0.6 percent to a new intraday high of 1,201.91 points, before edging back 
to trade up 0.5 percent at 1,201.42 points by 1217 GMT.
Shares in Ryanair rose 21c to E6.29. Ryanair's order of 175 aircraft allows for renewed, controlled growth at 3-5pc 
per annum, facilitating an increase in EU market share from c.15pc to c.20pc, according to Davy. Given that 
Ryanair's cost base (ex-fuel) is c.50pc below that of its competitors, this should provide ample growth opportunity 
across Europe, the broker said. Volume order pricing is described as "not dissimilar" to the last agreement. "As we 
indicated in our January research note on the narrow-body aircraft market, slot positions were clearly available to 
the right buyers where there was an opportunity for bulk discounts to keep the production line going on the existing 
B737-800 NGs aircraft ahead of the production of the new, so-called Boeing MAX. The controlled growth will be 
funded from internal resources, and capex requirements should allow share buybacks/special dividends to resume 
when appropriate. The controlled growth should, in our view, protect unit revenue while enhancing the growth 
multiple. We therefore increase our price target from E6 to E7 and retain our 'Outperform' rating," said Davy. 
Shares in Datalex rose 4c to E0.87 after it recorded a profit of dollar 1.1 million (E852,180) in 2012. The company, 
which provides ecommerce and retail software to airlines and other companies in the travel industry, also saw its 
revenues rise by 15pc to dollar 32 million. The Dublin-headquartered company includes Delta Airlines, Aer Lingus

The ISEQ index headed towards the 4,000 level this morning with steady gains in a rally that could see it reach its 
highest level in five years.
By 12:45, the ISEQ was up 49.48 points to 3,986.08.
European shares extended gains today, with traders citing Greek media reports that Cyprus had reached a deal 
with Russia on the sale of Cyprus Popular Bank to Russian investors as the reason for the rise. The pan-European 
FTSEurofirst 300 index rose as much as 0.6 percent to a new intraday high of 1,201.91 points, before edging back 
to trade up 0.5 percent at 1,201.42 points by 1217 GMT.
Shares in Ryanair rose 21c to E6.29. Ryanair's order of 175 aircraft allows for renewed, controlled growth at 3-5pc 
per annum, facilitating an increase in EU market share from c.15pc to c.20pc, according to Davy. Given that 
Ryanair's cost base (ex-fuel) is c.50pc below that of its competitors, this should provide ample growth opportunity 
across Europe, the broker said. Volume order pricing is described as "not dissimilar" to the last agreement. "As we 
indicated in our January research note on the narrow-body aircraft market, slot positions were clearly available to 
the right buyers where there was an opportunity for bulk discounts to keep the production line going on the existing 
B737-800 NGs aircraft ahead of the production of the new, so-called Boeing MAX. The controlled growth will be 
funded from internal resources, and capex requirements should allow share buybacks/special dividends to resume 
when appropriate. The controlled growth should, in our view, protect unit revenue while enhancing the growth 
multiple. We therefore increase our price target from E6 to E7 and retain our 'Outperform' rating," said Davy.

Shares in Iliad , the French telecoms operator owned by billionaire Xavier Niel, rallied yesterday even as it reported 
a significant fall in net profit in 2012.
The low-cost telecoms group said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 10.6 per cent to 
EUR921.4m, beating consensus expectations for EUR827.77m.
However, group net income fell 26 per cent from the previous year, as the company put nearly a third of its 
revenues towards building its network and expanding market share.
The shares gained 5.4 per cent to EUR157.85.
Ryanair signalled to the market that it was preparing to increase its capital expenditure with plans to buy 175 jets 
from Boeing in a $16bn deal.
The low-cost carrier also said it would not issue any special dividends but would begin a share buyback programme 
again in 2015.
Investors weighed in with a show of confidence, sending the shares climbing 4.3 per cent to EUR6.05.
More widely, European markets continued to be in risk-off mode for a second session as uncertainty over a bailout 
for Cyprus continued to loom.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.4 per cent to 1,194.91. Banking stocks endured a second day of heavy selling with 
the banking sub-index sliding 2 per cent.

Highlight: $16bn deal signals new growth phase
Carrier to consider buying 125 more
Body
Ryanair signalled a new phase of growth yesterday by unveiling plans to buy 175 narrow-body passenger jets from 
Boeing in a $16bn deal.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, told the Financial Times that Europe's largest low-cost carrier by 
revenue would consider purchasing at least a further 125 Boeing aircraft.
He also said that Ryanair would not issue any special dividends or embark on share buybacks this year or next 
because of its proposed fleet expansion.
Ryanair announced a commitment yesterday to buy 175 of Boeing's current generation 737-800 narrow-body 
aircraft.
But it will consider the case for also purchasing at least 125 of Boeing's planned next-generation 737 Max aircraft 
which will have more fuel-efficient engines.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair could continue to increase its market share at the expense of flag carriers and other 
airlines on European short-haul routes.
He cited growth opportunities created by capacity cuts or restructurings at Air Berlin, International Airlines Group's 
Iberia, Alitalia, SAS, LOT Polish Airlines and Lufthansa.
"We want to position ourselves with these new aircraft to take up these opportunities," said Mr O'Leary.
Shares in Ryanair closed up almost 4.5 per cent at EUR6.06 yesterday.
Ryanair orders 175 jets from Boeing TRAVEL & LEISURE
Ryanair has a fleet of 305 aircraft, comprised entirely of Boeing 737-800s, and it carried almost 76m passengers in 
the year to March 2012.
With the additional 175 aircraft, Ryanair expects to increase its fleet to 400 - because some new jets will replace 
older ones - and carry 100m passengers in the year to March 2019.
But Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had a team evaluating the case for buying Boeing's planned 737 Max, and that - taken 
together with the 175 737-800s - the airline could end up buying more than 300 narrow-body aircraft from the US 
manufacturer.
That meant Ryanair could increase its fleet to 500, and carry 120m passengers each year by the early 2020s.
Ray Conner, head of Boeing's commercial aircraft division, said of the company's latest deal with Ryanair: "We are 
pleased that the . . . 737 . . . has been and will continue to be the cornerstone of the Ryanair fleet."
The 175 737-800s that Ryanair is proposing to buy are worth $15.6bn at list prices, but Mr O'Leary said he had 
secured a "reasonable discount" with Boeing.
Ryanair paid a second special dividend last year worth EUR492m, but Mr O'Leary said he did not expect further 
payouts, or share buybacks, until 2015 or 2016, given the airline's increased capital expenditure on new aircraft.
He also insisted that Ryanair had not given up on its efforts to take over Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, in spite of 
the European Commission's prohibition of the deal last month.
Ryanair is appealing against the decision.

Body
RYANAIR announced a $15.6bn (£10.3bn) order for 175 passenger jets from Boeing yesterday in a boost to the 
struggling plane manufacturer that should help the Irish airline consolidate its position as Europe's dominant low-
cost carrier.
The order for the current generation 737NGs keeps Ryanair as one of the few remaining all-Boeing airlines, after 
Lion Air of Indonesia earlier this week dealt it a blow by switching to rival Airbus in a $24bn mega-order.
The deal, signed in New York yesterday, will see Ryanair increase its fleet to 400 planes from 300 at present, as old 
planes are retired. Capacity will grow by 25 per cent to 100m passengers per year by 2018, Ryanair said. CEO 
Michael O'Leary declined to say how much of a discount he secured for the order, but said Boeing's struggles with 
the 787 had created an opportunity for both sides.
"Hopefully it will help refocus people's minds on the fact that Boeing continues to deliver great aircraft and is 
growing strongly, rather than a minor issue on the 787," he said.
The industry benchmark 737-800 model is worth $89.1m at list prices, but large orders attract steep discounts and 
industry appraisers value the plane closer to $40m.
The order for 737s delivers a timely boost to Boeing, which last week won US approval for test flights for its new 
787 Dreamliner, which has been grounded for two months after batteries burned on two of the super jets in 
January.
The Federal Aviation Administration last week approved Boeing's plan for testing a revamped battery system for the 
plane.
Ryanair signs landmark deal with Boeing
Boeing predicted the plane would be back in service in weeks, not months, but its biggest 787 customer, All Nippon 
Airways, said that prediction was too uncertain for it to base its planning on.

Irish low-budget airline Ryanair has been fined E370,000 by the Netherlands Consumer Authority for hidden costs 
associated with tickets purchased online by Dutch travellers.
The watchdog said that European regulations had been violated because full costs were unclear, consumers were 
not given the option to correct mistakes before finalising a booking and the company was difficult to contact and 
provided information in English, not Dutch.
"Ryanair offered air fares on its website that did not include all foreseeable and unavoidable costs, such as fees 
and surcharges," it said. "Consumers thus paid considerably more than the air fares that were initially displayed."
Ryanair, which the authority said has since revised the booking process and now provides accurate prices in 
advertisements, said it will appeal against the ruling. "The decision of the Dutch consumer authority is littered with 
errors. Ryanair will appeal this unfounded decision and confirms that its website fully complies with all EU and 
Dutch consumer protection regulations," a Ryanair spokesman said in a statement.

Body
There's finally some good news for Boeing: European discount airline Ryanair announced Tuesday it will buy 175 of 
the company's popular 737 jets, the largest order ever placed by a European carrier.
Chicago-based Boeing Co. has struggled ever since its new 787 Dreamliner was grounded by regulators in January 
following problems with its electrical system. It also was dealt a major blow Monday in the race to win the single-
aisle plane market when Indonesia's Lion Air signed a deal with rival Airbus for 234 A320s.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the deal will allow his airline to expand in markets such as Germany, Spain, 
Italy, Poland and Scandinavia. Neither side disclosed the purchase price for the 737-800s, but O'Leary said it did 
negotiate a bulk discount off the total list price of $15.6 billion. Ryanair received a 53 percent discount on a prior 
737 order. This time, O'Leary said he was paying "slightly higher" prices.
"I'm paying higher prices, I'm just not allowed to say so," O'Leary said, joking that Boeing executives got him drunk 
on St. Patrick's Day.
He said Ryanair will cease dividends and share buybacks for the next two to three years to help pay for the jets.
The deal was timed to coincide with Tuesday's visit by Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny to Washington, D.C., to 
meet President Barack Obama and senior American legislators for St. Patrick's Day-related events. Kenny plans to 
visit the Seattle area, the base for Boeing manufacturing, later this week.
Kenny, appearing alongside Obama, called the Boeing-Ryanair deal a contract "of extraordinary proportions" and a 
sign of Ryanair's stunning run of success.
Ryanair already operates a fleet of 305 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, each with 189 seats, one of the tightest 
configurations in the industry. It is Boeing's biggest European customer for the model, which launched in 1997 and 
faces global competition from the Airbus A320.
Boeing's primary 737 assembly line in Renton, Wash., faces a transition to building a newer model called the 737 
MAX by 2017. Ryanair's order represents about a half-year of full-time work for the plant.
Boeing wins major 737 jet order from Ryanair
Ryanair has yet to sign on for the new MAX jet, but O'Leary said he has assembled a team to evaluate the new 
version of the 737.
"Today's order is a very much interim order and will hopefully be a forerunner to ordering the MAX later on," he said 
at a signing ceremony in New York.
Ray Conner, the head of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, said this deal fills most of his 737 assembly line 
capacity until MAX production begins.
Conner said the problems with the 787 had "no bearing on this (deal) at all."
Ryanair expects to get the first new planes at the end of 2014. O'Leary said about 75 of the new-order 737s would 
replace older airplanes, but the fleet would grow to 400 by 2019. He said Ryanair expected its passenger volume to 
grow around 20 percent to 100 million passengers by 2019, by which time its workforce would expand from 8,500 to 
around 11,500.
O'Leary has spent years playing hardball with Boeing to secure the best possible price for his next bulk order.
The purchase contract for much of Ryanair's current Boeing fleet was agreed in the months following the 9/11 
terrorist attacks, when airlines struggled to place new orders. Later Ryanair's regulatory filings in Dublin confirmed 
that it received a 53 percent discount off Boeing's list prices. In 2009, O'Leary noisily withdrew from talks to 
purchase more 737s and hinted that Ryanair might turn to Airbus.
But both sides sang each other's praises Tuesday.
Conner said Boeing's "partnership with this great European low-cost carrier is of the utmost importance to everyone 
at The Boeing Company, and I could not be more proud to see it extended for years to come."
Ryanair is one of the world's wealthiest airlines, with more than $4 billion in cash available. Its business model 
offering Internet-only sales of low-fare tickets accompanied by a panoply of extra charges for credit card payments, 
checked baggage, boarding cards and reserved seats is increasingly copied by the industry.
Ryanair's specifications on its Boeings do away with standard touches, with no business-class seating and no tray 
tables on the backs of seats, permitting tighter spacing of passengers.
O'Leary said one key advantage of the 737 was the ability to fit 189 passengers on board, but he'd love to add 10 
more seats something that would require removing the two rear toilets, a move regulators would be unlikely to 
permit.
O'Leary repeated his headline-seeking proposal, originally made three years ago, to charge for use of the one 
remaining front toilet. He quipped that Ryanair would donate those profits to "prostate cancer and incontinence 
research."
Mayerowitz reported from New York.

Ryanair has made the biggest-ever order of Boeing planes by a European airline, announcing Tuesday it will buy 
175 aircraft in a major boost for the U.S. aerospace giant.
Neither side disclosed the purchase price for the 737-800s, but budget carrier Ryanair said it did negotiate a bulk 
discount off the total list price of $15.6 billion. Industry analysts said Ryanair almost certainly was paying less than 
half price, meaning a total bill below $8 billion, or $45 million per aircraft.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary and the head of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, Ray Conner, 
signed the agreement Tuesday in New York.
The deal was timed to coincide with Tuesday's visit by Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny to Washington, D.C. to 
meet President Obama and senior American legislators for St. Patrick's Day-related events. Kenny plans to visit 
Seattle and Washington State, the base for Boeing operations in the Pacific Northwest, later this week.
The move also takes the sting away from Boeing's loss of a big order on Monday, when Indonesia's Lion Air gave 
Boeing rival Airbus an order for more than 200 single-aisle planes.
Ryanair already operates a fleet of 305 Boeing 737-800 Next Generation aircraft. It is Boeing's biggest European 
customer for the model, which launched in 1997 and faces global competition from the Airbus A320. Both are 
single-aisle aircraft with cabins that typically carry 150 to 200 passengers.
Boeing's primary 737 assembly line in Renton, Washington, faces a transition to building a newer model called the 
737 MAX by 2017. Ryanair's order represents about a half-year of full-time work for the plant.
O'Leary said about 75 of the new-order 737s would replace older airplanes, but the fleet would grow to 400 by 
2019. He said Ryanair expected its passenger volume to grow around 20 percent to 100 million passengers by 
2019, by which time its workforce would expand from 8,500 to around 11,500.
Ryanair gives Boeing a boost with big order
O'Leary has spent years playing hardball with Boeing to secure the best possible price for his next bulk order and 
even sowed the seeds Tuesday for his next marathon negotiation, noting that his airline was "continuing to evaluate 
the benefits of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft."
The purchase contract for much of Ryanair's current Boeing fleet was agreed in the months following the 9/11 
terrorist attacks, when airlines struggled to place new orders, and later Ryanair regulatory filings in Dublin confirmed 
that it received a 53 percent discount off Boeing's list prices. In 2009, O'Leary noisily withdrew from talks to 
purchase more 737s and hinted that Ryanair might turn to Airbus.
But both sides sang each other's praises Tuesday.
"Ryanair is proud to buy Boeing, who have always made great aircraft, and the 737-800 has been the cornerstone 
of Ryanair's success due to its great engineering and phenomenal reliability," O'Leary said in a statement. "These 
175 new airplanes will enable us to lower cost and air fares even further, thereby widening Ryanair's cost and price 
leadership over other airlines in Europe."
Conner said Boeing's "partnership with this great European low-cost carrier is of the utmost importance to everyone 
at The Boeing Company, and I could not be more proud to see it extended for years to come."
Ryanair is one of the world's wealthiest airlines, with more than (EURO)3 billion ($4 billion) in cash available. Its

The ISEQ made strong headway today, bucking the trend across Europe on fears over the Cyprus bailout 
conditions and as Ryanair shares shot up thanks to a deal with Boeing.
The ISEQ was up 30.57 points to 3,936.60.
European shares fell in choppy trade by midday today as investors tried to hold their nerve after Cyprus's bailout 
package stoked anxiety about the euro zone's debt crisis. The island's stock exchange suspended trade today and 
Wednesday and banks remained shut as its parliament looked ready to reject the unprecedented levy on bank 
accounts, heightening the risk of an eventual financial collapse.
At home, shares in Ryanair climbed 25c to E6.05 after it confirmed that it has signed a deal with Boeing to buy 175 
new Next Generation 737-800 aircraft. The airline said that when finalised, the deal will be worth nearly dollar 15.6 
billion at current list prices. However, it is believed that Ryanair will pay much less for the planes. Ryanair said the 
purchase will allow its airline to grow to more than 400 airplanes, serving more than 100 million passengers a year 
across Europe by the time all the planes are delivered in 2018. It added that the deal is the largest ever aircraft 
order from a European airline. The agreement was signed by Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary and Boeing 
Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner in New York today. About 75 of these new aircraft will 
replace some of Ryanair's existing fleet of 305 Boeing 737s, but Ryanair said the remainder will drive new growth of 
its fleet of ''young, highly efficient airplanes''. UTV reported its FY12 results this morning, in line with expectations. 
Group revenue of £120m and operating profit of £23.7m, compared to our forecasts of £121m and £23.6m

(RTTNews) - Aerospace and defense giant Boeing Co. (BA) said Tuesday that it has received a commitment from 
Ireland-based low cost carrier Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) for 175 Next-Generation 737-800 aircraft. The 
deal, when finalized, will be worth $15.6 billion at list prices.
Upon approval by Ryanair's shareholders, the purchase will become Boeing's largest deal to date in 2013 and will 
also be the largest ever aircraft order from a European airline. Boeing said that after finalization, the deal will be 
posted to the Boeing Orders & Deliveries website as a firm order. According to the company's website, the 737-800 
model is valued at $89.1 million at list prices.
The announcement confirms media reports last week that Ryanair was close to announcing a $15 billion order for 
about 170 aircraft from Boeing. The order for the 737-800 model aircraft, known as the Next-Generation or NG, will 
be the single-biggest aircraft purchase ever by Ryanair. The carrier has the largest fleet of Boeing airplanes in 
Europe.
Ray Conner, President and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes said, "This agreement is an amazing testament 
to the value that the Next-Generation 737 brings to Ryanair. We are pleased that the Next-Generation 737, as the 
most efficient, most reliable large single-aisle airplane flying today, has been and will continue to be the cornerstone 
of the Ryanair fleet."
Separately, Ryanair noted that the 175 new airplanes will enable it to further lower cost and airfares, thereby 
widening the company's cost and price leadership over other airlines in Europe.
Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair said, "Ryanair is pleased to sign this agreement with Boeing to purchase 175 new 
737-800 jets, which will expand our fleet to over 400 units, creating over 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and 
engineers, while allowing us to grow our low-cost airline service by about 5 percent per annum over the next 
several years and take our traffic to 100 million passengers by March 2019."
Ryanair said that about 75 of these new aircraft will replace some of its existing fleet of 305 Boeing 737s, while the 
remainder will drive new growth of Ryanair's fleet of young, highly efficient airplanes.
The order will deliver a boost to Boeing after the company won approval from the Federal Aviation Administration 
last week for plans to test and certify improvements to the battery system on its now grounded 787 Dreamliner fleet.
Ryanair To Buy 175 Boeing 737-800 Aircraft Worth $15.6 Bln
Ryanair's deal also comes after Airbus, the aircraft manufacturing subsidiary of European Aeronautic Defence and 
Space Co. or EADS NV (EADSY, EADSF), on Monday snared Indonesian low-cost airline Lion Air as a new 
customer from rival Boeing after pocketing an order for 234 eco-efficient A320 Family aircraft.
Lion Air's order includes 109 A320neo, 65 A321neo and 60 A320ceo, and is the largest ever order for Airbus in 
terms of the number of aircraft and the overall sum. The deal is valued at about 18.4 billion euros or $24 billion.
Meanwhile, Boeing plans to phase out the NG in favor of the new 737 Max version. The 737 Max builds on the 
strengths of the NG and incorporates the latest-technology CFM International LEAP-1B engines. The 737 Max is 
designed to compete with the Airbus' fuel efficient A320neo in the narrow-body aircraft segment.
In Tuesday's regular session, BA is trading at $85.53, up $0.35 or 0.41 percent on a volume of 320,632 shares. 
RYAAY is trading at $41.14, up $0.81 or 2.01 percent on a volume of 24,893 shares.

European budget airline Ryanair says it is buying 175 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, the biggest-ever order of Boeings by 
a European airline.
Boeing confirmed the sale agreement Tuesday.
Neither side disclosed the purchase price, but Ryanair said it negotiated a hefty discount off the aircraft's total list 
price of $15.6 billion. Industry analysts said Ryanair most likely has agreed to pay less than $8 billion.
Ryanair already operates a fleet of 305 Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary says the 
Dublin-based airline says it plans to replace some older aircraft but take its fleet over 400 by 2019, when it expects 
to be carrying more than 100 million passengers annually.
Ryanair said O'Leary and Boeing chief executive Ray Conner signed the agreement Tuesday in New York.

Airbus achieved a coup yesterday by winning a $24bn order for more than 200 passenger jets from Lion Air, the 
fast-growing Asian low-cost carrier.
Lion Air has bought aircraft from Boeing, Airbus's arch-rival, but plans to purchase 234 single-aisle jets from the 
French manufacturer owned by EADS, the European aerospace and defence group.
Boeing is tomorrow expected to unveil an order from Ryanair, the Irish carrier, for 175 single aisle aircraft, in a deal 
worth more than $15bn at list prices. Boeing and Ryanair declined to comment.
The Lion Air contract - one of the biggest in Airbus's history - was announced amid much fanfare at a ceremony in 
Paris hosted by François Hollande, French president.
Mr Hollande's government seized on the Airbus success. He said the success of the aerospace sector was an 
example to other French industries such as struggling carmakers.
"France is the only country along with the US that has an industry able to conceive, design and make an aircraft," 
he said.
Jakarta-based Lion Air, Indonesia's largest airline, has emerged as a key rival to AirAsia .
Last September, privately held Lion Air announced plans to establish operations in Malaysia, where AirAsia 
generates most of its profits.
AirAsia is Asia's largest budget airline and Airbus's biggest customer for its single-aisle aircraft. Lion Air last year 
placed an order for 230 narrow-body aircraft with Boeing in a deal worth $21.7bn at catalogue prices.

Ryanair expects to be able to start a programme of share buybacks and special dividends after 2015.
This is once most of the capital expenditure needed for its order of 175 Boeing 737-800s has ended, chief executive

Ryanair signed a commitment to buy the aircraft in New York today in a deal worth dollar 16 billion at list prices.

 Irish discount airline Ryanair Holdings PLC (Nasdaq:RYAAY) announced on Tuesday that it ordered 175 Boeing 
Co. (NYSE:BA) Next Generation 737-800 jets, nearly doubling the size of its fleet and marking Boeing's largest 
order in 2013.
 Once deliveries of the order, Boeing's largest ever from a European customer, are completed in 2018, Ryanair's 
aircraft will number 400, allowing it to increase its service by about 5 percent per annum over the next several 
years, the airline said. Passenger traffic is expected to exceed 100 million by March 2019.

(RTTNews) - Ireland-based low cost carrier Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) has reached a deal with the 
Boeing Co. (BA) to buy 175 new Next Generation 737-800 airplanes. Once the deal is finalized, the agreement 
would be worth about $15.6 billion at current list prices and would allow Ryanair to grow its airline to over 400 
airplanes, and traffic to more than 100 million passengers per annum across Europe by the end of the delivery 
stream in 2018, as well as creating over 3,000 new jobs across the airline.
The agreement was inked by Ryanair Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, and Boeing Commercial Airplanes 
President CEO, Ray Conner, in New York.
According to Ryanair, nearly 75 of these new aircraft would replace some of its existing fleet of 305 Boeing 737s, 
while the rest would drive new growth of Ryanair's fleet of young, highly efficient airplanes. These airplanes would 
allow Ryanair to grow its low-cost airline service by some 5 percent per year over the next several years, taking 
Ryanair's traffic to over 100 million passengers by March 2019.

Highlight: Ryanair, an operator of scheduled-passenger airline, has reported that total passenger traffic for the 
month of February 2013 was 4.2 million, a decrease of 6%, compared to 4.47 million for February 2012.
Body
Load factor for the month of February 2013 was 77%, an increase of 1 percentage point, compared to 76% for 
February 2012. For the year-to-date period of 2013, total passenger traffic was 79.3 million, an increase of 4%, 
compared to the corresponding period of 2012. Ryanair's Head of Communications, Robin Kiely said: "As 
previously guided, Ryanair's adjusted February 2013 traffic fell by 3% over February 2012 as we grounded up to 80 
aircraft. The leap year of February 2012 had 29 days and accounted for a further 3% drop. However, Ryanair's load 
factor increased by 1% and we delivered another record 12-month traffic as almost 80m passengers chose one of 
Ryanair's ultra-low fares since February 2012."

Thinking of buying shares in the Esure public offer? No less than 17 brokers have signed up to sell shares to retail 
investors . But before filling in the application form, consider the cautionary tale of a broken gnome.
The garden adornment in question was taken from a neighbour's property on Hallow'een a few years ago, no doubt 
as part of a drunken prank. Once the pilferer grew tired of it, he hurled it across the road, where it bounced off my 
car bonnet and came to rest on the pavement - minus its head, which I found by my front bumper, gazing forlornly 
at the sky.
I took my car to a local bodyshop to get an estimate for fixing the dent that the gnome's headbutt had left in the 
bonnet. The first question I was asked was: "Is the insurance paying, or are you?"
What difference would it make, I asked. "Well, if you're paying, we'll beat it out and respray it. If the insurance is 
paying, we'll just get a new bonnet." The difference in monetary terms was material and, as it turned out, 
uneconomic for an 11-year-old motor.
Does the industry know it's been taken for a ride in this way; that there are two prices for every job? Of course. It 
knows too that rates it is charged for providing hire cars to not-at-fault accident victims are inflated and many 
"whiplash" injury claims are spurious .
You might say that I'm too cynical by half. But look at what chief executive Clive Maxwell, chief executive of the 
Office of Fair Trading said about the industry when it launched a probe last year : "The insurers of at-fault drivers 
appear to have little control over the bills they must pay, and this may be leading to higher costs for them and 
higher premiums for motorists." The OFT said the average repair bill was inflated by £155 and car hire by more 
than £500.
I suspect the industry is unperturbed for two reasons. One is that such high costs deter entrants to a crowded 
market. Second, because insurers receive a cut on every referral , a few quid extra for every bit of "motor legal 
Calm down, dear - it's only an insurer Serious Money
protection" added to a policy. Such "ancillary revenues" are the equivalent of Ryanair's excess baggage charges. 
Insurers need them because underwriting motor cover - like running an airline - is competitive and barely profitable.
True, Esure is better than most in this respect. The key profit metric in insurance is the "combined ratio" of claims to 
premiums, where lower is better.
At group level, Esure's is lower than its quoted rivals (see table). Its dividend policy - it pledges to pay out half of 
post-tax reported profit to shareholders, with more as special dividends - looks good too. But not as good as its 
timing. The insurer is coming to market as the FTSE 250 - of which it would most likely become a constituent - has 
smashed through new highs, and low rates of return elsewhere have reinvigorated retail investors' interest in the 
stock market. Motor premiums may also be close to a cyclical peak, while the introduction of gender-neutral pricing 
has boosted its Sheilas' Wheels brand, which caters for women drivers.
Direct Line, an insurer with a big motor book, came to market last autumn. Its shares have risen about 10 per cent 
since. As with most recent flotations, it pays to look at who is selling and why. Esure was founded by Peter Wood, 
who led a management buyout a few years ago, along with Tosca Penta, a private equity firm. They are now selling 
parts of their stakes for over £400m and the £50m raised will refinance debt. In other words, the investor is a mere 
ballbearing in a piece of financial engineering, providing a capital gain, not capital.
Esure will probably be a reasonable dividend stock. But it's unlikely to be exciting, and there are risks: regulatory 
action might trim those ancillary revenues, premium rates may decline, and dividends may not be bombproof. So, if 
you do elect to buy the shares, don't be like my neighbour's gnome. Don't lose your head.

The ISEQ surged to a new high this morning as investors received a welcome boost in the form of a highly 
successful auction of long-term Irish debt.
The index rose 29.81 points to 3,888.44.
Despite being well flagged over recent weeks, the sale of a new 10-year benchmark bond yesterday, the first since 
2010, was greeted very favourably by markets. Goodbody flagged yesterday that a sale of between E2bn-E3bn 
would be a reasonable result, but, in the end, the sale of E5bn of the new bonds, out of total demand for E12bn, 
provides another fillip in Ireland's efforts to fully exit the IMF/EU programme.
"Whether Ireland can now claim to have returned to full market access and thus be eligible for the ECB's OMT 
programme is a debatable point. Given that Ireland's funding costs are now well below Italy and Spain and the 
E5bn raised by Ireland is not far off the E7bn that Italy managed to borrow yesterday, Ireland has a very good case 
to argue that it is meeting those conditions. Indeed, head of the NTMA John Corrigan stated yesterday that recent 
sales, including yesterday's, constituted "a resumption of normal access to the markets'," the broker said. CRH 
gained 45c to E17.52, Smurfit Kappa climbed 24c to E12.66 and Ryanair gained 3c to E7.00.

successful auction of long-term Irish debt.
Despite being well flagged over recent weeks, the sale of a new 10-year benchmark bond yesterday, the first since 
2010, was greeted very favourably by markets. Goodbody flagged yesterday that a sale of between E2bn-E3bn 
would be a reasonable result, but, in the end, the sale of E5bn of the new bonds, out of total demand for E12bn, 
provides another fillip in Ireland's efforts to fully exit the IMF/EU programme. "Whether Ireland can now claim to 
have returned to full market access and thus be eligible for the ECB's OMT programme is a debatable point. Given 
that Ireland's funding costs are now well below Italy and Spain and the E5bn raised by Ireland is not far off the E7bn 
that Italy managed to borrow yesterday, Ireland has a very good case to argue that it is meeting those conditions. 
Indeed, head of the NTMA John Corrigan stated yesterday that recent sales, including yesterday's, constituted "a 
resumption of normal access to the markets'," the broker said. CRH gained 62c to E17.69, Smurfit Kappa climbed 
16c to E12.58 and Ryanair gained 2c to E5.77.

Boeing investors are not narrow-minded, even if the aircraft manufacturer (mostly) is. Shareholders have shrugged 
off the much-publicised battery troubles of the wide-bodied Dreamliner and enjoyed the ride as Boeing's shares 
have risen 12 per cent this year.
There are 50 Boeing 787 Dreamliners in operation. Another 750 Dreamliners will be delivered in coming years, but 
only 200 in the next two, according to Credit Suisse. By contrast, of the 1,400 aircraft Boeing is set to deliver in the 
next two years, 900 will be the narrow-bodied 737's, which seat fewer than 150 passengers, to the Dreamliner's 
300, (and cost about half as much). The rumoured $18bn deal this week with Ryanair is for 200 of these narrow 
planes. Boeing's image is dominated by the Dreamliner; its business is dominated, for now, by the 737.
There are, however, rumblings of increased competition in the market for smaller jets, which Boeing and Airbus 
currently split 50-50. In the next two years Bombardier begins delivering its narrow-bodied CSeries. And there will 
be Chinese and Russian entrants as well. Airbus and Boeing, meanwhile, have their next generation versions 
coming on-stream in the next five years.
For now though, Boeing is well-positioned. Its backlog exceeds six years and from 2011 to 2014 shipments are 
expected to grow on average 15 per cent annually. Airlines have embraced efficient new models in an era of higher 
jet fuel costs and growing global demand.
Boeing's share price ascent in 2013 follows a bump of only 3 per cent in 2012. It trades at 16 times forward 
earnings, the same as early 2012 so earnings growth has powered the higher share price. With news that the US 
aviation regulator has approved Boeing's plan to resolve the Dreamliner battery issue , there could be room for 
multiple expansion too.

FOR the best part of three weeks I had been relishing the chance to headline tip First Lieutenant in this afternoon's 
Ryanair Chase after it became fundamentally clear connections were bypassing Friday's Gold Cup with him.
However, his price has collapsed over the last few days and the 11/2 available less than two weeks ago is now just 
5/2 in places. He's now simply too short.
First Lieutenant is owned by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and the only reason he is not lining up in the Gold Cup 
is that his owner is already represented by leading fancy Sir Des Champs. Trainer Mouse Morris has tried without 
success to convince O'Leary that the longer trip of Friday's race would suit better, but the lure of winning his own 
race has proved too much.
Don't get me wrong, I still think First Lieutenant is the one they all have to beat as he'll love the drying ground and 
has a magnificent Festival record. He has been trained the same way for the last few seasons, namely plenty of 
runs before Christmas before a decent break and an assault on Cheltenham.
Those two runs include a win in the Neptune Investment Hurdle over this trip two years ago and a gallant second to 
Bobs Worth in last year's RSA Chase. However, the fact that his price has shortened and that only eight have been 
declared makes me tempted by Blue Square Bet's 7/2 about CUE CARD.
Colin Tizzard has his stable in cracking form and must be confident of a bold showing from last year's Racing Post 
Arkle runner-up after saddling a winner here on Tuesday. The drying ground now places less emphasis on stamina 
and the small size of the field means he'll have a better view of the front - something that seems key to a bold 
showing.
It just has to be Cue BILL ESDAILE PREVIEWS THE RYANAIR , KIM MUIR AND CROSS COUNTRY CHASE
He would be a very confident selection without Champion Court in the field, but his presence means he's unlikely to 
get an uncontested lead and that's a slight worry. Yet, Cue Card has already performed with credit at three 
Cheltenham Festivals and I expect him to finally be led back to the winner's enclosure.
Last year's winner Riverside Theatre was given an unbelievable ride by Barry Geraghty 12 months ago and he is 
reportedly over his recent bout of ulcers. He runs very well fresh, but I still don't feel Cheltenham plays to his 
strengths and I anticipate Cue Card and First Lieutenant will be too good.
Finding the winner of the 24-runner Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Chase for amateur riders is a task more fitting for 
Sherlock Holmes than my good-self, but I'll give it my best shot anyhow. It often pays to side with the best pilots as 
the likes of Derek O'Connor, JT McNamara and Jamie Codd would have had the choice of five or six potential rides.
On that basis, my eye is immediately drawn to O'Connor's mount SUPER DUTY, who was talked about at one point 
as a potential outsider for yesterday's RSA Chase. The Donald McCaintrained seven-year-old hasn't been out of 
the first two in all nine of his completed starts and was only just touched off by David Pipe's Goulanes at Wetherby 
last time.
My selection was a winner over these fences back in December and looks just the battle-hardened type to put up a 
bold show in this contest. A slight worry would be the fact that only four of the last 33 winners were aged seven or 
younger, even though those of that generation have been favourite in three of the last five renewals (and second 
favourite on the other two). That negative aside, he looks a rock-solid proposition and should be backed at around 
5/1 with Blue Square Bet.
Jonjo O'Neill's Alfie Sherrin is interesting now that the ground is starting to dry out, while I've got a sneaky feeling 
that Frisco Depot will show up well for Charlie Longsdon if Sam Waley-Cohen can stay in the saddle.
The Glenfarclas Cross Country Chase (5.15pm) was originally scheduled to take place on Tuesday, but the frozen 
course was deemed un-raceable. The marathon contest over the banks has been rescheduled to be run as the last 
race on the card this afternoon and I'm switching from Arabella Boy, my selection of two days ago, now that the 
ground is drying out.
Instead, I'm siding with Jessica Harrington's BOSTONS ANGEL, at a whopping 9/1 with Coral. Regular readers of 
this column will remember that the nineyear-old landed us a nice touch when winning the RSA Chase at this 
meeting a couple of years ago.
Admittedly, things haven't gone that well since that wonderful afternoon back in 2011 and he hasn't won any of his 
10 starts since. However, the switch to cross country fencing seems to have rekindled his enthusiasm and he ran a 
corker over this course when second to another of today's mudlark rivals, Outlaw Pete, in November.
He now meets that rival on eight pounds better terms on his preferred decent surface and he looks sure to reverse 
that form.
One that could go well at a big price is A New Story, although I'm not sure he'll appreciate the drying ground. The 
15-year-old is making his sixth appearance in this contest having never finished out of the money (form figures of 3-
4-1-3-2). There is a suspicion that the years may have caught up with him, but he's not one to rule out.

The European Union is considering beefed up measures to help stranded passengers get compensation and find 
quicker ways to get home.
EU Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas said Wednesday that a new package with improved measures would also 
boost carriers from the 27 member nations in global competition since consumers would be drawn to companies 
offering the best conditions.
`'These rules only apply if you are on a European carrier. So my message is `'Fly European," Kallas told reporters.
Under the proposals, Kallas said that if carriers cannot reroute passengers themselves within 12 hours they must 
find another airline or other transportation.
Kallas' proposals now will be taken up by the European parliament and the 27 member nations.
The airline industry gave the proposals a muted welcome.
The Association of European Airlines said it was `'a step in the right direction" which should help clean up a 
complicated system currently in place that often leaves it unclear who is responsible for what.
`'There have been so many court cases," said Geert Sciot, spokesman for the AEA.
In January, the EU's top court ruled that Irish low-cost airline Ryanair has to pay out compensation to passengers 
who were stranded due to the 2010 volcano eruption in Iceland, arguing that airlines have an obligation to provide 
care, even in such "extraordinary circumstances."
With his proposal, Kallas said he wanted to clarify the rights of passengers and airlines on such issues as a natural 
disaster, rights to re-routing and connecting flights.
EU seeks better passenger rights
The European association of regional airlines ERA complained that making the first carrier in a multi-segment trip 
responsible for compensation if something went wrong would put too much pressure on their carriers, since they 
often are the first link.
The Geneva-based International Air Transport Association took issue with the 12-hour re-routing proposal, 
complaining it did not take into account the cost.
`'The ticket price paid and the cost of re-routing should be related.  If your Bic pen doesn't work, you don't expect to 
get a Mont Blanc as compensation," said IATA CEO Tony Tyler.

Highlight: Boeing Co won approval from U.S. transport regulators on Tuesday to start testing a redesigned battery 
for the 787 Dreamliner
Body
Boeing Co won approval from U.S. transport regulators on Tuesday to start testing a redesigned battery for the 787 
Dreamliner, putting it one step closer to getting the troubled airplane back into regular service.
Also on Tuesday, sources told Reuters the planemaker was close to signing a dollar 15 billion deal to sell about 170 
single-aisle 737 planes to budget Irish carrier Ryanair.
Boeing's shares closed up 1.5 percent, hitting an almost five-year high, and extended gains in after-hours trade, 
while shares in Japan's GS Yuasa Corp, the battery maker for Dreamliner, rose 0.9 percent in Tokyo on 
Wednesday, outpacing a 0.5 percent drop in the benchmark Nikkei.
Late on Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it approved Boeing's battery certification plan and 
will permit two aircraft limited flights to test the new design. Regulators grounded the 50 fuel-efficient Dreamliners in 
use by airlines on Jan. 16 after a battery fire on a Japan Airlines Co Ltd 787 at Boston airport and a second battery 
incident on an All Nippon Airways Co Ltd flight in Japan. Boeing halted deliveries of the lightweight aircraft, although 
its factories continue to make it. The firm is losing an estimated dollar 50 million a week while the planes are 
grounded. "We won't allow the plane to return to service unless we're satisfied that the new design ensures the 
safety of the aircraft and its passengers," U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. Boeing's 
new battery - which it presented to the FAA in late February - is designed to minimize the chances of a short circuit, 
better insulates the cells within the battery, and adds a new containment and venting system to prevent damage 
even if the battery catches fire. The FAA said the new design must pass a series of tests before it is approved and 
that the agency will be "closely involved" in the certification process. The FAA has been criticized for delegating too 
much responsibility to manufacturers in certifying equipment. The FAA's decision was welcomed by Boeing, while 
Kyoto-based GS Yuasa declined to comment. "Today's approval from the FAA is a critical and welcome milestone 
toward getting the fleet flying again and continuing to deliver on the promise of the 787," Boeing Chief Executive 
Boeing sorts problems, new Ryanair order Boeing up
Jim McNerney said in a statement. Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau, its FAA counterpart, reiterated that 787 flights can 
resume before Boeing finds the root cause of the battery problems as long as the fix demonstrates that the trouble 
experienced on the All Nippon Airways flight can be prevented. "There are various steps towards resuming flights 
and this is another step forward so this is a good development. And I may be repeating my earlier comments, but 
there are still steps required," said Shigeru Takano, senior safety official at the CAB. Airline customers cautiously 
agreed. All Nippon Airways, a Dreamliner launch customer which has 17 of the planes it wants to bring back into 
service, said the FAA approval represented "a major step towards the resumption of flights," while rival Japan 
Airlines said it was another step in the right direction, and would continue to work with related parties on the issue. 
Steven Udvar-Hazy, chairman and chief executive of Air Lease Corp, which has 12 787s on order, called the FAA 
approval a "good step forward" during a panel discussion at an aircraft trading conference in Orlando, Florida. "It is 
not flying yet. It is a first step," said Udvar-Hazy, considered one of the world's most influential airplane buyers. "I'm 
happy that the FAA has taken the constructive role in working with Boeing to address this problem." The FAA, 
under political pressure to ensure no further mishaps, has yet to approve Boeing's redesigned battery. The 
consensus among plane buyers and operators at the Orlando conference was that the 787 may be able to re-enter 
service in June, barring further surprises. Still, that would not be early enough for airlines to plan summer 
schedules. News of the big order from Ryanair further boosted investor enthusiasm for Boeing. Sources familiar 
with the deal, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the order was exclusively for the current generation 
737NG jet. If completed, it would mark a major win against rival Airbus, a unit of Europe's EADS. Boeing shares 
closed up dollar 1.22, or 1.5 percent, at dollar 84.16 on the New York Stock Exchange, their highest close since 
May 2008, and extended gains after hours to dollar 84.44. That is the highest since the end of May 2008. ( C)

and this is another step forward so this is a good development. And I may be repeating my earlier comments, but 
there are still steps required," said Shigeru Takano, senior safety official at the CAB. Airline customers cautiously 
agreed. All Nippon Airways, a Dreamliner launch customer which has 17 of the planes it wants to bring back into 
service, said the FAA approval represented "a major step towards the resumption of flights," while rival Japan 
Airlines said it was another step in the right direction, and would continue to work with related parties on the issue. 
Steven Udvar-Hazy, chairman and chief executive of Air Lease Corp, which has 12 787s on order, called the FAA 
approval a "good step forward" during a panel discussion at an aircraft trading conference in Orlando, Florida. "It is 
not flying yet. It is a first step," said Udvar-Hazy, considered one of the world's most influential airplane buyers. "I'm 
happy that the FAA has taken the constructive role in working with Boeing to address this problem." The FAA, 
under political pressure to ensure no further mishaps, has yet to approve Boeing's redesigned battery. The 
consensus among plane buyers and operators at the Orlando conference was that the 787 may be able to re-enter 
service in June, barring further surprises. Still, that would not be early enough for airlines to plan summer 
schedules. News of the big order from Ryanair further boosted investor enthusiasm for Boeing. Sources familiar 
with the deal, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the order was exclusively for the current generation 
737NG jet. If completed, it would mark a major win against rival Airbus, a unit of Europe's EADS. Boeing shares 
closed up dollar 1.22, or 1.5 percent, at dollar 84.16 on the New York Stock Exchange, their highest close since 
May 2008, and extended gains after hours to dollar 84.44. That is the highest since the end of May 2008. ( C)

(RTTNews) - Gainers:
Boeing Co. (BA) is up 0.64 percent to $84.70. The company announced that it has received FAA approval on its 
plan to test and certify improvements to the 787's battery system. Boeing also announced that it expects worldwide 
commercial aircraft production to surge past $100 billion in 2013. There were also reports that Ryanair Holdings 
(RYAAY) is planning to order about 200 Boeing 737s.
BG Medicine, Inc. (BGMD) is rising 4 percent to $1.89. The company's fourth quarter net loss narrowed from the 
prior year period, primarily due to an adjustment of accrued R&D expenses. Product revenue from the BGM 
Galectin-3 test surged from the year-ago quarter.
Decliners:
Velti Plc (VELT) is plunging 27 percent to $2.25. The company slipped to a loss in its fourth quarter and its adjusted 
earnings per share missed Wall Street view. Revenues grew 12 percent, but were below the consensus estimate. 
The company forecast first quarter and 2013 revenue sharply below analysts' expectations.
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SPPI) is slumping 35 percent to $8.01. The company warned on its FUSILEV 
sales in the first quarter as well as 2013, citing a change in ordering patterns of FUSILEV following the recent 
stabilization of the folate analog market. The company currently expects its 2013 total company revenues to decline 
sharply from prior year and well below the consensus estimate. Meanwhile, the company said it expects to be 
profitable in 2013 on a non-GAAP basis.

(RTTNews) - European stocks are seen opening lower on Wednesday before Italy holds three-year and 15-year 
bond auctions later in the global day, with plans to raise up to 7.25 billion euros. With Italy's debt costs rising around 
20 basis points at an auction yesterday, investors eagerly await the results of today's long-term auction for clues on 
the direction of the euro. Spain also plans to hold a special, off-calendar auction of long-term debt tomorrow.
Meanwhile, the U.K.'s unimpressive trade and industrial data for January indicate that the economy is still struggling 
to re-balance, and adds to fears that it is heading for a triple-dip recession, Capital Economics UK Economist 
Samuel Tombs said.
The European Parliament on Tuesday approved with overwhelming majority the "two pack" economic governance 
legislation that will do more to deliver growth and lays down clear procedure for countries seeking EU financial help.
Investors await industrial production data from Eurozone and inflation numbers from France for further clues on the 
growth outlook.
Asian stocks fell broadly for the second day running, as a lack of fresh triggers and concerns over a slowdown in 
China prompted investors to lock in some recent gains. Australia's All Ordinaries index lost half a percent, led by 
financial stocks after National Australia Bank announced a business restructuring.
Chinese stocks extended their recent declines for the fifth session, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite 
currently down a percent, dragged down by property developers amid reports Shenzhen has imposed price curbs 
on developers.
Japan's Nikkei index fell 0.6 percent, weighed down by a firmer yen after Japan's largest opposition party said it 
would vote against the government's nomination of Kikuo Iwata for the position of deputy governor at the Bank of 
Japan. Seoul shares rose modestly ahead of Bank of Korea's rate decision tomorrow.
Across the Atlantic, trading activity is likely to be impacted by the release of reports on retail sales, import and 
export prices, and business inventories.
In domestic corporate news, British lender Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc plans to sell a further 15.3 percent 
stake in Direct Line Insurance Group through a share placement to institutional investors. The sale will reduce 
RBS's stake in the insurance company to less than 50 percent.
European Stocks To Edge Lower Before Italian Bond Auction
Global miner BHP Billiton Plc said it believed its sponsoring of the 2008 Olympics held in Beijing complied with all 
applicable laws and that it was co-operating with a probe into possible violation of anti-corruption laws.
Ireland-based low cost carrier Ryanair Holdings Plc is close to announcing a $15 billion order for about 170 aircraft 
from Boeing Co., media reports suggest.
France's Technip SA announced the acquisition of Ingenium AS, an offshore engineering and services contractor 
located in Oslo, Norway.
Swiss human resources firm Adecco SA posted a plunge in fourth-quarter 2012 net income attributable to 
shareholders to 35 million euros from last year's 133 million euros.
Novartis AG said it will present new data on Multiple Sclerosis or MS treatment at the 65th annual meeting of the 
American Academy of Neurology.
European stocks ended Tuesday's session with mixed results, as investors digested weaker than expected British 
industrial production data and successful government debt auctions in Spain and Italy. The German DAX fell 0.2 
percent, but France's CAC 40 and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 inched up about 0.1 percent each.
U.S. stocks posted modest losses overnight, as investors paused for breath following a seven-session winning 
streak and amid another relatively light day on the economic front. The Dow managed to end just above the 
unchanged line, reaching another record closing high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 0.3 percent and the S&P 
500 slipped 0.2 percent.

US stocks retreated from multiyear highs with the leading US benchmark set to snap a seven-day winning streak as 
investors looked to take profits.
The S&P 500, which had been approaching all-time record levels during its multi-day run, fell 0.3 per cent to 
1,552.26 by 1pm in New York.
Shares in Yum! Brands were among the best performing stocks yesterday on the benchmark after the fast-food 
chain operator said its business in China picked up in February.
The company, which operates chains such as KFC and Taco Bell, gained as much as 5.4 per cent in early morning 
trading. By 1pm the shares had shaded back to trade 1.4 per cent higher to $68.71.
Jefferies' analyst Andy Barish said the stock, which trades at a multiple of 23 times its forward earnings forecast for 
2013, was fairly valued despite the better than expected sales results.
Meanwhile, Costco rose 2.4 per cent to $104.94 as the wholesale retailer said higher membership fees helped it 
beat analysts' forecasts for its latest quarterly profits.
The company also reported a pick-up in market share against its competitors, including Walmart. Shares in 
Walmart were 1.1 per cent higher at $73.79.
JC Penney , a US department store chain, climbed 4.9 per cent to $15.79 as it moved to deny market rumours that 
its chief executive was planning to step down amid the company's troubles.
Defensive sectors, led by telecoms and healthcare, were among the few rising industry groups on the benchmark, 
while those more closely tied to the global economy cooled.
"We've been up so many days in a row that we were due for some profit-taking," said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives 
strategist at TD Ameritrade.

Meanwhile, the CBOE Vix index, a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500 and a gauge for investor nerves, 
rose 8 per cent to 12 after touching a six-year low a day earlier.
"On a normal day, a jump in the Vix like this would definitely catch your attention, but considering where we are 
coming from it should be expected," Mr Kinahan added.
The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.4 per cent to 3,240.10, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent 
to 14,437.81.
Boeing , the US aircraft manufacturer and Dow component, rose 0.9 per cent to $83.70 on reports that it had 
received a 200 jet order from UK-based budget airline operator Ryanair Holdings.
Shares in computer product group Hewlett-Packard were 1.2 per cent higher to $21.28 even as the UK's Serious 
Fraud Office said it had launched an investigation into Autonomy, the UK-listed software maker, acquired by the 
company for $11bn in 2011.
The S&P 500 energy sector index was 0.2 per cent higher as benchmark crude prices rose. Refiners including 
Valero Energy , which gained 3.4 per cent to $45.22, pared some of their losses after a recent sell-off.
Analysts at Barclays said the 10 largest publicly traded independent refiners had lost a total market value of $5bn. 
They added that the declines may be due to investor concerns over the impact of an increase in biofuel prices.
Google shed 1 per cent to $826.78 as the internet search and advertising company agreed to pay $7m in a 
settlement with 38 US states for violating privacy rights.
VeriFone rose 5.6 per cent to $21.61, a day after the electronics payments services company said its longstanding 
chief executive would step down.
The company, which has lost 26.8 per cent from the start of the year, recently acknowledged that it had struggled in 
shifting from hardware-based business into software services.

Highlight: Dreamliner cleared for test flights
Proposed battery fix approved
Body
Boeing is seeking to return its troubled 787 Dreamliner to commercial service within weeks after the main US 
aviation regulator approved its proposals to upgrade the aircraft's lithium-ion batteries, giving the go-ahead for test 
flights.
The decision yesterday by the Federal Aviation Administration comes after Boeing last month proposed a solution 
to the problems that would improve insulation between battery cells, put the battery in a fireresistant box and let 
smoke from any overheating vent outside the aircraft.
One person familiar with the situation said the company was seeking a return to flight within three to four weeks.
However, Ray LaHood, US transportation secretary, said there would still be an extensive programme of testing of 
aircraft fitted with a prototype version of the proposed fix to see if it operated as designed.
"We won't allow the plane to return to service unless we're satisfied that the new design ensures the safety of the 
aircraft and its passengers," he said.
All 50 787s delivered to customers have been grounded since January 16 after the second of two severe 
overheating incidents within 10 days in the aircraft's unconventional batteries.
In the first, on January 7 in Boston, the battery on a Japan Airlines 787 caught fire shortly after the aircraft had 
arrived from Tokyo. In the second incident, on January 16, an All Nippon Airways 787 was forced to make an 
emergency landing in western Japan after a battery started emitting smoke.
Jim McNerney, Boeing chief executive, said staff had been working "around the clock" to understand the issues 
around the battery and develop a solution.
Boeing closer to solution for 787 Aerospace
"Today's approval from the FAA is a critical and welcome milestone towards getting the fleet flying again and 
continuing to deliver on the promise of the 787," he said.
Neither the FAA nor Boeing would say when the grounded aircraft might be able to return to normal commercial 
service. But Ray Conner, Boeing's head of commercial aircraft, last week said he expected a return to flight "really 
fast" after FAA approval of a fix.
The FAA's grounding of the 787 fleet was its first for an entire aircraft type since 1979. The regulator's step was the 
latest in a series of setbacks for the high-profile programme. The first aircraft - delivered in September 2011 - was 
four years late because of multiple design and production problems . The FAA's move on the 787 comes as Boeing 
prepares to announce an order for 200 of its narrow-body 737 for Ryanair, the no-frills airline.

The main Dublin shares index rose today
to its highest level since September
2008 as vitality and confidence returned
to the markets.
The index rose 18.07 points to 3,865.69. Sterling slipped to a 2-1/2 year low and European shares were flat today

The Irish Independent this morning carries a story suggesting that Ryanair has placed a long-awaited order with 
Boeing for 200 aircraft with a total value of dollar 18bn (E14bn) at list prices, with deliveries between 2015 and 
2017. According to the report, the deal will be announced by President Obama and Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny on 
St Patrick's Day (March 17th). There has been no confirmation or denial of this report from Ryanair and there was 
no source cited in the newspaper article. If true, the order would put Ryanair back on a growth trajectory in the latter 
part of the decade and put it on course to achieve its 120m passenger target, giving it a market share of c.18-20pc 
versus 12pc today. 
Ryanair shares fell 2c to E5.84. Zamano, the Irish provider of interactive applications and services to mobile

(RTTNews) - Ireland-based low cost carrier Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) is close to announcing a $15 
billion order for about 170 aircraft from Boeing Co. (BA), according to media reports on Tuesday.
The order for the 737 model aircraft, known as the Next-Generation or NG, will reportedly be the single-biggest 
aircraft purchase ever by Ryanair. The order is intended to replace Ryanair's existing 737 aircraft and will enable 
the carrier to expand its footprint beyond Europe. The 737-800 model is valued at $89.1 million at list prices, 
according to Boeing's website.
According to the Irish Independent newspaper, the order is set to be confirmed by U.S. President Barack Obama 
and Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny at the White House during an annual reception to mark St. Patrick's Day.
The potential order will deliver a boost to Boeing after the cvompany won approval from the Federal Aviation 
Administration earlier on Tuesday for plans to test and certify improvements to the battery system on its now 
grounded 787 Dreamliner fleet.
Boeing plans to phase out the NG in favor of the new 737 Max version. The 737 Max builds on the strengths of the 
NG and incorporates the latest-technology CFM International LEAP-1B engines.
Boeing decided in July 2011 to revamp the top-selling 737 instead of building an all-new aircraft. The company 
plans to introduce the Max version with its more efficient engines in 2017 after phasing out the current 737 model. 
The 737 Max is designed to compete with the Airbus' fuel efficient A320neo in the narrow-body aircraft segment.
Media news about the order by Ryanair comes even as the company plans to appeal a recent decision by the 
European Commission to block a third attempt by the airline to take over its Irish rival Aer Lingus Group plc 
(AERL.L) over competition concerns.
Ryanair said in late February that the history of the EU's treatment of its takeover offers for Aer Lingus conclusively 
proved that the prohibition was a "political" decision to pander to the vested interests of the Irish Government, a 
minority 25 percent shareholder in Aer Lingus, and was not one that was based on a fair and reasonable application 
of EU competition rules or precedent airline merger approvals in Europe.
RYAAY closed Tuesday's trading on the Nasdaq at $39.77. In after-hours, the stock declined $3.00 or 7.54 percent 
to $36.77.

Singular visionHeadline to come headline to come headline to; Airbus's star 
salesman John Leahy recalls how the airframer broke Boeing's narrowbody 
market dominance - and explains his problem with Ryanair

Airbus's super salesman John Leahy joined its North American division in 1985, just as the A320 narrowbody was 
transitioning from the drawing board to reality.
The fortunes of Airbus and Leahy have been entwined since the two first came together. Leahy would climb through 
the ranks to become commercial chief in 1994 and chief operating officer for customers in 2005, while the A320 
would spawn a family of siblings and its success would cement Airbus's position as the world's leading airliner 
producer.
Back in 1985, Airbus was a two-product manufacturer - the A300/A310 widebody twinjets - but had a secret 
weapon: an all-new single-aisle twinjet, the A320.
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas had the single-aisle market locked up. Airbus needed something revolutionary, so it 
developed the first fly-by-wire airliner (after Concorde), with a futuristic cockpit incorporating large screens replacing 
almost all the old clockwork dials, and side-stick controllers in place of conventional yokes (see Feature P38).
cracking America
Airbus Industrie, as it was known then, had an "ambitious" sales target of 600 units for the A320. When Leahy 
joined total sales stood at less than 50 aircraft as Airbus struggled to get traction beyond its European "home 
market".
"People were saying the A320 was a mistake: 'this is another European social programme - Concorde all over 
again. And the sidestick controller was like a video game. No pilot's ever going to fly that,'" he recalls.
Singular visionHeadline to come headline to come headline to Airbus 's star salesman John Leahy recalls how 
the airframer broke Boeing 's narrowbody market domi....
Leahy was tasked with getting big US orders. "We had a better mousetrap but we just had to convince people of it," 
he says. "Back then some airlines in the US still hadn't even heard of Airbus. In the mid-'80s it wasn't easy even 
getting in the door to talk to people."
One of the big turning points for the A320 - and Airbus - came in October 1986 when Northwest Airlines signed for 
100 orders and options. "That was my deal," says Leahy, lighting up as he recalls snatching a key US customer 
from under his ­rival's nose. "Boeing never believed Northwest would ever go with Airbus, which always gave us a 
chance. But Northwest studied the airplane and checked all the stories our competitors used to tell about support. 
You know, that 'Airbus works 35h weeks and you'll never get a part on weekends, etc'."
The A320 and its siblings have now racked 9,100 sales. Its success was central to Airbus's arrival, first as genuine 
threat to established players, then as world's top airliner producer.
A market that took Airbus time to crack was the low-cost sector. Once, any budget airline worth its salt only flew 
Boeings. But Airbus's reputation was changed a decade ago when EasyJet did a huge deal for A319s. Yet Leahy 
tells how Airbus dropped the ball when it had a chance to snare the UK LCC early on: "We screwed things up with 
[EasyJet founder] Stelios Haji-Ioannou when he had dinner with me and [Airbus boss] Jean Pierson back in the 
1990s, and I learned from that," he says. "Pierson was not impressed and I didn't have a good case to argue that 
this guy with his EasyJet concept was really going to make it and we let them drift off to Boeing, almost by default.
"Later on, it took us a lot of effort with [EasyJet chief executive] Ray Webster and the management team, because 
they'd started down the path with the 737 and we said we really need to get these low-cost guys on our side."
But Leahy - who loves being the last salesman to pitch, so that he can make the final impression - has not forgiven 
one of the world's biggest low-cost outfits, Ryanair, for what he views as time-wasting in a campaign a decade ago. 
As a result, it would appear that there is no likelihood of an A320 flying in Ryanair colours all the time that Leahy is 
running Airbus sales. "The trouble I have with [Ryanair boss] Michael O'Leary is that it became apparent that he 
really wanted to stay with Boeing. And I am not going to use Airbus resources to help an airline get a better deal out 
of my competitor," he says.
"We had a better mousetrap
[but] in the mid-'80s it wasn't
easy even getting in the door
to talk to people"

The mammoth order - due to be confirmed by US President Barack Obama and Taoiseach Enda Kenny at the

orders ever placed with Seattle-based manufacturer Boeing.
It means Ryanair has all but thrown in the towel in its seven-year battle to buy Aer Lingus, and will now focus once 
more on its own long-term expansions efforts. A spokesman for the airline declined to comment.
The order will be used to replace some existing aircraft in Ryanair's fleet, but it means the carrier will be in a 
position to extend its footprint to even more corners of Europe and outside the region.

Christine Moloney is chief executive of LeisureWorld, which was set up in 1996 to provide public leisure services to 
the people of Cork on behalf of Cork City Council.
**It is a private, not-for-profit company limited by guarantee with a voluntary board of directors, and employs 98 
staff. It runs five facilities across Cork: Bishopstown, Churchfield, Mahon Golf Course, Sam Allen Football Pitches 
and the GUS Healy Pool in Douglas.**
.....
**What are the main responsibilities of your job?**
To strategically lead, direct and manage the city council leisure services through LeisureWorld, ensuring the 
delivery of quality and value for money services including all associated aspects of income generation, business 
development, financial management and control and staff management.
**What motivates you in your job?**
Working with people motivates me in general. I love nothing more than listening to so many diverse opinions and 
points of view; I learn from this every day and once I'm learning, I'm motivated.
**How would you describe your work style?**
I feel that I am an inclusive type of manager. My team are my success. We agree things collectively which makes 
everything much easier. I can be firm when it's needed but above all I treat everyone fairly.
**What is the most valuable professional lesson you have learned so far?**
When life provides you with an opportunity to help people or to be part of something great, grab it with both hands 
and give it 110 per cent.
Working Week
**In Ireland, whose career do you most admire and why?**
Michael O'Leary. He is clear about his vision, and his messaging follows through with no ambiguity. Love him or 
hate him, he has to be admired. The financial success of Ryanair is a testament in itself, in today's economic 
climate.
**Based on your experience, what is the most valuable career advice you can offer others?**
Empower people to live their own dreams and fulfil their own goals. If the people around you are happy, everyone 
will benefit.
**In terms of doing business in Ireland, what do you think is the biggest challenge we face? What would you like to 
see change?**
I think in today's environment it's the negativity across all levels of society that is most challenging. For change, I 
believe our leaders need to be braver and take real meaningful action, particularly in government -- it's their 
fundamental role to care for *all*their people. We need fairness in society and a real drive to bring back the pride in 
who we really are as a culture and a country.
**What is your ultimate professional goal at this point?**
To drive the leisure and fitness industry forward to play a critical role in the implementation of making Ireland active 
and healthy. This needs to be done through accessible pathways for all in society. At a personal level, I would like 
to see that women in business play a far greater role and I strive for gender equality -- if not for myself, then 
certainly for my daughter's future.

There we were a few weeks back, a group of friends putting the world to rights, when suddenly someone half-
jokingly came out with it: "They should put Michael O'Leary in charge. That'd sort it." It has been a while since I 
heard that one.
There was a time when no pub conversation was complete without someone interjecting that the political system 
needed someone like the high-profile Ryanair boss, who has made a bit of a career out of being shockingly rude, 
unashamedly cheap and undeniably effective.
This got me thinking. Europe's brashest chief executive might in fact soon be looking out for a new challenge, given 
that Ryanair's latest bid to take over Aer Lingus appears to have run out of steam. (Brussels rejected it once again 
over competition concerns). It's not impossible to imagine him considering a new career. I wonder what would 
happen if his many fans finally got their wish, and O'Leary were -- somehow -- to take over.
What would an Ireland run by O'Leary be like? How would he deal with Brussels? With horsemeat? With debt? His 
role model could only be former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who is one of the few politicians he 
appears to actually admire. He is certainly on record as paying her tribute, in his own inimitable fashion. "Without 
her, we'd all be living in some French bloody unemployed republic," he once said.
And although he memorably called those who campaigned against the Lisbon Treaty "idiots and lunatics", O'Leary 
doesn't actually like Europe much. He's not keen on the French and he's been especially rude about Germans.
O'Leary also doesn't like handing over money unless absolutely necessary, and I doubt he could care less about 
being the best boy in the class. Thus I strongly suspect that the first thing he would do upon taking office would be 
to calmly cease all debt repayments to the European Union, the European Central Bank and the IMF, and then 
brazen out the inevitable global outcry.
Far-fetched? This is the man who has said to disgruntled Ryanair customers: "We don't want to hear your sob 
stories. What part of 'no refund' don't you understand?" He'd say the very same thing to Angela Merkel.
Off Message
With all debt dispatched, O'Leary would turn his attention to the public finances. His priority would be stripping out 
unnecessary expenditure. This would almost certainly include any state spending on the environment (O'Leary is on 
record as promising to increase Ryanair's carbon emissions), and possibly heritage and overseas aid. Oh and the 
entire social welfare system.
Any horrified response would be countered by O'Leary as follows: those lazy b*******s can get out and work for a 
living, like I had to.
Having stripped out most of the costs associated with running the country, O'Leary would then be free to proceed to 
cut corporate taxes to zero and personal taxes to never-before-seen lows, thereby instantly winning over the bulk of 
the electorate (though, obviously, not those on welfare).
A new Ryanair-reminiscent relationship would emerge between taoiseach and population under which everyone 
would complain incessantly about the regime, but use it anyway.
How he would love being in charge of transport . . . the decree allowing Ryanair to take over Aer Lingus -- take that, 
you eurocrats! -- would be signed on O'Leary's first day in office. Bye-bye booking seats. Bye-bye baggage 
allowance. Bye-bye aeroplane staff that make eye contact and smile.
Having sorted out the skies, O'Leary would proceed to other transport issues. In a surefire vote-winner, all 
government cars, for starters, would be fitted with taxi plates. Next on the agenda would be to 'Ryanair' the roads 
and train tracks.
On the plus side, I guess, public transport charges would be slashed. On the minus side, he'd need to increase 
capacity to compensate; we'd all do our daily commute on hanging straps, even on the upper deck of the number 9. 
Intercity trains would probably be allowed to retain half their seating but a premium rate would apply to anyone 
obliged to book a seat. A strict luggage allowance would be introduced. Buggies would be tolerated, but only just. 
Got a problem with that? "We're charging EUR 10 to get from Cork to Dublin," O'Leary would declare in the Dáil. "If 
you want comfort, pay for it."
Then there's health. He'd be horrified by the waste in the healthcare system, but he couldn't just privatise it all. 
Perhaps he'd devise a bare bones system of universal care. Under this system, all essential surgeries would be 
carried out immediately free of charge, but 'frills' -- like access to a general anaesthetic rather than a local during 
surgery or a bed in a room with fewer than eight people -- would command a surcharge in the public system.
This could also extend to after-care; patients could only be fed if they paid for the privilege (vending machines 
would be supplied for those who opted out); pain relief could be administered on a commercial basis. Obese people 
could pay a premium for any services, having been responsible for their own downfall.
This is Michael O'Leary after all, the man who only half jokily asked Ryanair customers if fat people should pay 
extra on flights and then remarked: "Nobody wants to sit beside a really fat ******on board. We have been frankly 
astonished at the number of customers who don't only want to tax fat people but torture them."
Hospital stays would not in any case be countenanced for anyone capable of being folded into a wheelchair and 
pushed out the door. Challenged about the questionable morality of the government's new healthcare approach, 
O'Leary could reasonably respond: "Did your granny have to wait to have her hip replaced? No she did not. Are we 
running a state deficit? We are not. What's your problem?" Indeed.
Perhaps Brussels should have given him Aer Lingus after all.

BRITAIN'S air transport network is rated eighth best on the planet, beating most of Europe and the United States, 
according to a report by the World Economic Forum.
But the UK is seen as the second most expensive country in the world for taxes on air travel.
Only Chad came below the UK in a poll published by the think tank. Swaziland came top, followed by Iran, 
Luxembourg and Puerto Rico.
Airline bosses said the figures showed that air passenger duty, which is set to rise to £188m on some long-haul 
flights next month, is denting the UK's global reputation.
"This isn't just a blow to our national pride but demonstrates the unjustified level of air passenger duty and… 
provides further evidence that the chancellor must take action in the Budget on this destructive tax," said the chief 
executives of EasyJet, Ryanair, Virgin and IAG in a statement.
In the WEF annual survey of travel and tourism, the UK came 22nd on quality of ground transport, 12th on ports 
and 16th on railways.

BRITISH Airways parent IAG yesterday blamed strike action in Spain for a 2.4 per cent fall in group traffic in 
February.
The firm, which is struggling to turn around Madrid-based sister carrier Iberia, said traffic at the Spanish airline was 
down 20.6 per cent as disgruntled staff conducted a series of strikes.
British Airways delivered 5.3 per cent growth on a revenue passenger kilometres basis.
Budget airline Ryanair said its February traffic dropped six per cent on a year ago to 4.2m, due to its decision to 
ground up to 80 planes over the winter and the loss of the leap year this year.
Ryanair's load factor rose a percentage point to 77 per cent.

Governance On 21 February, Finmeccanica continued its management shake-up in the wake of the arrests by 
Italian police of two top executives in a corruption probe. Daniele Romiti has been nominated as AgustaWestland 
chief executive to replace Bruno Spagnolini, who was placed under house arrest as part of the bribery investigation. 
Luigi Pasquali and Alessandro Franzoni become chief executives of space business Telespazio and defence

Losses at iberia drag on IAG's performance
Airlines Loss-making Iberia "must adapt to survive" if it is to have any future, parent company International Airlines 
Group has warned as full-year operating losses at the carrier hit [euro]351 million ($459 million). IAG is proceeding 
with a 15% capacity cut and will slash 3,807 posts at Iberia as it has been unable to reach agreement with unions. 
The Spanish flag carrier's performance was in stark contrast to that of its sister airline British Airways, which turned 
in an operating profit - including operating losses of [euro]98 million from BMI - of [euro]347 million. Overall, IAG 
recorded an operating loss for the period to 31 December of [euro]23 million before exceptional items, compared 
with an operating profit of [euro]485 million in 2011.
EC rejects latest aer lingus takeover bid
Merger The European Commission has rejected Ryanair's third attempted takeover of Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, 
insisting that the low-cost carrier's remedy packages failed to fully address its competition concerns. An earlier 
"statement of objections" by the Commission had outlined a series of problems with the proposed merger. Its 
doubts centred on 46 crossover routes for which a combined Aer Lingus-Ryanair would command monopolies or 
near-monopolies. Ryanair's remedies were "simply inadequate" to allay the EU's concerns, it says.

Group for £1.5 billion ($2.3 billion). The company, formerly BAA, now owns London Heathrow as well as Aberdeen, 
Glasgow and Southampton airports.
India signs for cheetal helicopters
Rotorcraft Hindustan Aeronautics has received a contract worth RS4.18 billion ($77 million) to produce 20 Cheetal 
multirole helicopters for the Indian army. The company will deliver the aircraft, associated equipment and personnel 
training over four years.
Shake-up continues at troubled finmeccanica
Governance On 21 February, Finmeccanica continued its management shake-up in the wake of the arrests by 
Italian police of two top executives in a corruption probe. Daniele Romiti has been nominated as AgustaWestland 
chief executive to replace Bruno Spagnolini, who was placed under house arrest as part of the bribery investigation. 
Luigi Pasquali and Alessandro Franzoni become chief executives of space business Telespazio and defence 
systems operation WASS respectively. Giuseppe Orsi, also arrested by Italian police, was removed as the 
company's chief executive earlier in February.
phantom eye uav makes comeback
modification Boeing's hydrogen-powered Phantom Eye testbed made a "picture-perfect landing" at the end of its 
second flight, the company says. The long-endurance unmanned air vehicle reached an altitude of 8,000ft (2,440m) 
in a 1h sortie on 25 February, having suffered a landing-gear mishap during its debut in June 2012.
Losses at iberia drag on IAG's performance
No Headline In Original
Airlines Loss-making Iberia "must adapt to survive" if it is to have any future, parent company International Airlines 
Group has warned as full-year operating losses at the carrier hit E351 million ($459 million). IAG is proceeding with 
a 15% capacity cut and will slash 3,807 posts at Iberia as it has been unable to reach agreement with unions. The 
Spanish flag carrier's performance was in stark contrast to that of its sister airline British Airways, which turned in an 
operating profit - including operating losses of E98 million from BMI - of E347 million. Overall, IAG recorded an 
operating loss for the period to 31 December of E23 million before exceptional items, compared with an operating 
profit of E485 million in 2011.
EC rejects latest aer lingus takeover bid
Merger The European Commission has rejected Ryanair's third attempted takeover of Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, 
insisting that the low-cost carrier's remedy packages failed to fully address its competition concerns. An earlier 
"statement of objections" by the Commission had outlined a series of problems with the proposed merger. Its 
doubts centred on 46 crossover routes for which a combined Aer Lingus-Ryanair would command monopolies or 
near-monopolies. Ryanair's remedies were "simply inadequate" to allay the EU's concerns, it says.
Hammerhead payload revised
Clarification Following our 26 February-4 March 2013 article about the unmanned Piaggio Aero/Selex ES P.1HH 
HammerHead, Piaggio says the P180 Avanti II derivative has an expected maximum mission payload of 909kg 
(2,000lb), and not 1,810kg as reported.

EU chief: Michael O'Leary 'not our enemy number one'

Length: 292 words
Body
EU transport commissioner Siim Kallas has heaped praise on Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary and denied 
that there was any political influence from the Irish government behind Europe's refusal to grant permission for the 
airline's bid to take over Aer Lingus.
Ryanair has accused the Commission of holding it to a "different and considerably higher standard" than any other 
EU flag carrier airline, saying it had no alternative and "very good grounds" to appeal the decision to the European 
courts.
However, Kallas dismissed the notion that Ryanair was disliked at the highest levels in Europe.
"I have met Michael O'Leary many times and I like him very much," Kallas told *The Sunday Business Post*. "I 
definitely do not accept that he is some kind of enemy number one of the European Union.
"We highly appreciate the achievements of Ryanair, which is one the most successful companies and a successful 
model as well.
"I personally admire him, and we have very good talks. I reject the notion that the Commission does not welcome 
him as an entrepreneur. On the contrary."
Kallas insisted his colleagues in the competition wing of the EU Commission undertook "very scrupulous legal work 
before making their decision".
Ryanair is currently at war with Europe on a range of other issues, including passenger rights.
The European Court of Justice recently ruled that Ryanair must compensate more passengers who couldn't reach 
their destinations on schedule because of the 2010 Icelandic volcano.
EU chief: Michael O'Leary 'not our enemy number one'
Correspondence from Ryanair, much of it berating EU policy, is understood to greatly exceed the amount that the 
Commission receives from any other airline in Europe.
One source said that the airline had sent more than 250 letters to the Commission in recent times.

Ireland 's digital dilemma
Ireland's digital dilemma

Over the past decade, social media platforms and online forums have become some of the most influential means 
of getting and communicating information. But with little regulation covering this continuously-changing area, many 
users think that their posts and comments are not subject to the same legal scrutiny as those of a newspaper 
reporter. However, the Irish courts are taking a different view.
Earlier this month, Ryanair secured a High Court order compelling Eircom to disclose the identities of two 
anonymous posters who have been posting comments about Ryanair on a pilots' website that the airline claims are 
"highly defamatory". Once the airline has the identities of the posters, it could potentially sue both parties.
The issue of the potential for libel on Twitter was highlighted earlier this year when telecoms executive and political 
campaigner Declan Ganley received an apology and an out-of-court settlement after defamatory comments were 
made about him on the social media platform.
And last November, Irish oil exploration firm US Oil and Gas secured court orders aimed at identifying people who 
posted allegedly defamatory material about it on internet message boards with a view to suing them following a 
"catastrophic" fall in its market value.
"On the ground we see a definite and sustained increase in these sorts of problems across a fairly wide cross-
section of Irish business life,"   said Jon Legorburu, head of dispute resolution at ByrneWallace.
"The overwhelming scope, power and instantaneous nature of online social interaction have left vistas of potential 
harm for businesses. What is significant in terms of US Oil and Gas are the ramifications of social media on share 
prices, and fortunately our client had a remedy and the means to effect it. Other cases can involve people's 
personal circumstances as opposed to their trading activities, and it is not alarmist to be concerned about this, 
particularly for those who may not have the means to litigate.  "

One of the issues that arises with defamation is the fact that information on a social network such as Twitter can 
spread across thousands of people within a short time, making litigation against individuals problematic and 
creating potential difficulties for plaintiffs, particularly those without deep pockets.
"If an item goes viral, then the traditional remedy of damages is rendered potentially fruitless against a multi-headed 
hydra of defendants. - One can imagine the ineffective nature of chasing after thousands of anonymous posters," 
said Legorburu. "Perhaps the law in relation to defamation, despite its recent statutory revision, is still not 
sufficiently evolved enough to deal with some of the graver implications of social media."
The decision by internet giants Facebook and Twitter to establish their European headquarters in Dublin has also 
opened them up to Irish defamation laws and EU laws on libel and privacy, although the fact that firms have Irish 
operations does not necessarily leave them open to the Irish courts.
Google has argued that any legal issues over content should be addressed to its California office as the company's 
search engine operations are based there. In a case brought by Ballymascanlon House hotel, which was settled in 
2011, Google Ireland sought to have the case discontinued on the grounds it was not responsible for providing the 
Google web search service. California-based Google Inc was added as a defendant.
"In some senses, the law goes both too far and not far enough," said TJ McIntyre, a lecturer in UCD School of Law, 
solicitor and chairman of Digital Rights Ireland. "Irish defamation laws are some of the most draconian in the world 
and there is an ability to identify users without their having a chance to oppose the application to identify. There is a 
risk that an application could be used improperly to identify someone for an ulterior purpose."
While firms such as Ryanair have the resources to pursue individuals through the courts, issues in the Irish legal 
system can arise for firms and people who don't have the means to take a defamation action.
"The law doesn't go far enough in another sense," said McIntyre. "The primary means to protect yourself online is 
either through a complaint to the gardaí in a case of online harassment or, for defamation online, you can seek to 
identify someone through a court application. In each case, the remedy is weak because of resource constraints. 
Gardaí are under-resourced to deal with internet issues, and the ability to protect your reputation through 
defamation is effectively confined to those who can afford to pay for it. We end up with a law that over-protects 
some people, but can fail others who don't have the same wealth."
In England, the courts have had to deal with a litany of cases with social media users, particularly those on Twitter. 
In one of the most serious legal issues to arise online, people who posted photos claiming to show James Bulger's 
killer Jon Venables face a possible jail sentence after Britain's chief legal adviser launched contempt
proceedings against them.
The case is not the first time Twitter users have found themselves in contempt of court, after more than 70,000 
people named Manchester United footballer Ryan Giggs as the person at the centre of an injunction row. Legal 
action was taken by Giggs to "obtain limited information concerning the unlawful use of Twitter" as he was identified 
online, although traditional media outlets were gagged from naming him.
The political class has also found itself embroiled in Twitter rows, with Conservative peer Lord McAlpine 
announcing his intention last November to seek libel damages against Twitter users over defamatory posts linking 
him to child abuse.
Legal action against most Twitter users has been dropped, with McAlpine instructing his lawyers to drop cases 
against users with fewer than 500 followers. The case is now focused on Sally Bercow, the wife of House of 
Commons speaker John Bercow, in what could be the country's first High Court Twitter libel trial.

Co-op managers will need to cash in more than a few divi stamps if they are to buy 600 branches from Lloyds 
Banking Group. This week, regulators identified a £1bn hole in The Co-operative Bank 's capital, making it likely 
that the mutual group will have to sell off some businesses to meet the initial £350m payment.
Swire , the Asian conglomerate that owns the Cathay Pacific airline, is looking to hop from one runway to another, 
with a bid for French fashion brands Sandro and Maje, which are being sold by LVMH's private equity unit. Quite a 
journey for a company founded as a Liverpool import-export business in 1816.
Record label  executives were dusting down their old Prince albums - and no doubt their glass coffee tables - this 
week as the latest recorded music revenue figures gave them licence to "party like it's 1999". Global sales last year 
rose for the first time since the millennium, according to industry association IFPI.
Rather like a passenger staring at a departure board in the vain hope that "delayed" will change to "boarding", 
Ryanair finally learnt this week that its Aer Lingus takeover had been "cancelled". The EU's competition 
commissioner formally grounded the proposal, citing "very serious competition problems".

Highlight: The new ASU has made ECA debt more expensive, and some carriers are already changing their 
funding habits.
Body
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines sent out a request for proposal recently seeking finance for one 777. The airline was 
originally open to all bids, including US Ex-Im-backed debt and Japanese operating lease with call option (Jolco).
However, the airline is reportedly considering only Jolco bids after deciding that US Ex-Im debt was too expensive 
under the new Aircraft Sector Understanding (ASU).
One financier with knowledge of the KLM request for proposal says: "It is interesting to see a live case of the new 
Aircraft Sector Understanding affecting decisions. They have gone with the Jolco because it is cheaper."
Increasing premiums
Under the new ASU, which was agreed in 2011 and came into effect in January, export credit agency financing 
effectively becomes twice as expensive because of an increase in premiums.
It had been hoped that the new ASU, by making export credit agency (ECA) support more expensive, would reduce 
airlines' reliance on it. ECA debt, of course, was always meant to be a last-resort financing. Instead, it became the 
preferred option for many carriers. Indeed, a sizeable proportion of the market has been financed under this last 
resort financing. According to research by Airfinance Deals Database, ECA guarantees backed about 20% of all 
global aircraft deliveries for the past two years.
The availability of cheap ECA debt has also undermined the secondary market, with carriers that used to be able to 
buy only older jets, now able to acquire newer aircraft under ECA support.
Under the 2007 Aircraft Sector Understanding the premiums ranged from 4% to 7.5% depending on the credit rating 
of the borrower, which increased the cost of the deal by 3.4% (4% of 85% of the value of the aircraft).

Analysis: Learning to live with the new ASU
Under the new ASU, the upfront payment, according to the latest premium rates, is about 2% more expensive in the 
case of the best credit rating.
Market versus government
The new ASU scheme has created a debate regarding the extent to which governments should support the export 
of jets. Some, such as Ray Sisson, Awas's chief executive officer, liken ECA debt to a government subsidy that 
skews the market, and that manufacturers should allow free market dynamics to dictate the price, and the 
production rate, of aircraft.
In contrast, Howard Millar, Ryanair's chief financial officer, was forthright about the new ASU at the 15th Global 
Airfinance Conference, stating that the carrier was no longer interested in the ECA structure because it had become 
too expensive. The Irish low-cost carrier has been an extensive user of export credit, financing more than 200 jets 
under government-backed debt.
However, it is questionable whether ECA programmes should be used to assist top-tier carriers in this way. Ryanair 
has funded 72% of its fleet through ECA-backed debt. However, the carrier has the financial muscle and enough 
pull among banks to finance itself using other structures. Evidently, some would prefer the status quo; others want 
free market forces to decide. This debate is likely to continue despite the new ASU premiums.
Good names only please
What other structures can airlines tap? As ever it depends on the names involved.
There is commercial debt and tax lease structures such as Jolcos. Yet these structures are only truly available to 
tier-one airlines. In today's climate, banks are unwilling to lend 12-year commercial debt to weaker credits.
Other structures, such as Jolcos, rely on tapping conservative investors, but they are unlikely to invest into tier-two 
airlines, especially when they can invest in known names such as KLM.
Carriers will still us ECA-backed bonds while they stay cheap. Again, though, only top names need apply because 
investor appetite is unlikely to be there for lesser name airlines.
Top-tier names are still likely to use ECA debt as well in order to diversify funding. So how much the industry's 
overall reliance on ECA debt drops is still an open question.
Secondary market, secondary thought
Tier-two carriers will still use ECA debt, despite the increase in costs, because other structures are largely 
unavailable to them. Of course, they could do sale/leasebacks, but certainly airlines will wish to own a certain 
proportion of their fleet, and for the weaker airlines ECA support will be the only way to do this.
But ultimately that still leaves the secondary market of older aircraft in a state of flux. Tier-two carriers and below 
using cheap ECA debt to acquire new jets has seen the market for used jets - particularly narrowbodies - fall off.
These carriers are used to operating new, more efficient aircraft and will still want them, especially with fuel costs 
rising. The secondary market has been undermined by a lack of financing opportunities because only a few banks 
are willing to fund older aircraft. In addition, it has been hit by the unnecessary introduction of age restrictions in 
jurisdictions that should be taking older aircraft.
The new ASU may drive some airlines away from using as much ECA debt as they did, but that will only apply to 
the top credits, which have alternative financing options available anyway. Second- or third-tier carriers will have to 
pay more in ECA premiums under the new Aircraft Sector Understanding but the cost increase is simply not enough 
to push them in any meaningful number towards the used jets market.

News analysis
The hope is to get passenger numbers back to levels seen before recession, writes Rose Jacobs
Body
Charlie Cornish is determined to return passenger numbers at Stansted to pre-recession levels over the next five 
years - or at least get close. Whether he eventually wants those travellers taking off from one runway or two is 
another question.
The chief executive of Manchester Airports Group yesterday completed his £1.5bn purchase of London's third 
biggest airport by passenger numbers - a ranking the facility still keeps despite an annual traffic fall of more than a 
quarter since 2007, to slightly more than 17m passengers a year.
Mr Cornish blames that fall as much on increased landing charges as the wider economy, and plans to "enter into 
commercial discussions with airlines" promptly. "Our strategy will be geared around incentivising growth," he says, 
laying out a 2018 passenger target of 22.5m.
In the near-term, the growth strategy will be based firmly on Stansted's historic customer base: the point-to-point 
leisure traveller with a budget airline ticket to a European destination. But MAG - which also owns Manchester, East 
Midlands and Bournemouth airports - hopes eventually to attract a wider variety of carriers and their customers, 
including those flying long-distance routes and offering first and business-class cabins.
Mr Cornish believes Stansted's catchment area, within a two-hour drive of the airport, will support that richer mix. 
But he is reluctant to push for a bigger catchment, via either investment in the train link to central London - to 
shorten journey times - or a pitch for Stansted becoming a hub airport rather than, or in addition to, Heathrow, 
whose parent company sold Stansted.
New owner sets out Stansted's growth plan
Those ideas, he says, would need instead to be backed by the Davies commission, the independent team asked by 
prime minister David Cameron to look into airport capacity in the south-east of England . And while MAG will be 
submitting material to the commission, its current position is the one formulated before it won Stansted: merely that 
regional airports can be part of the solution.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair and, thereby, Stansted's biggest customer, has stronger opinions. He 
argued last year that London needed three new runways, and predicted the first would be built at Stansted, the 
second at Heathrow and the third at Gatwick.
Of a second Stansted runway, Mr Cornish says: "At this stage, it would be difficult to rule it in or out."
His plans for the airport's retail space and parking are more concrete. At the moment the security barrier for 
departing passengers bisects the terminal lengthwise. MAG plans to move it closer to the entry doors - because 
check-in desks need less space in the era of print-at-home tickets - creating more space for shopping and dining 
after security.
That change will be part of £40m the company has devoted to improving retail over the next two years. Plans are 
also afoot to introduce first or business-class car parks, and to benefit from being part of a group of airports by 
coordinating the facilities' supply chains.
His lack of ambition for big-ticket projects will be a relief to airlines, which fund airport improvements through take-
off and landing fees. "Stansted is a well-invested airport," he says. "It's a fairly simple airport. It doesn't need a lot of 
capital expenditure in the next 10 to 20 years".
To fund the Stansted acquisition, MAG struck a deal with Industry Funds Management of Australia in which the 
Australian group will buy into MAG, taking a 35.5 per cent equity stake and 50 per cent of voting rights.
That dilutes the holdings and voting rights of Manchester City Council and nine other local councils, from 55 per 
cent to 35 per cent in the case of Manchester City Council's equity stake, and from 45 to 30 per cent for the other 
councils. Manchester will keep a 50 per cent voting share, while the other councils will give up their voting rights.
Mr Cornish says he expects IFM, which holds stakes in nine Australian airports, to be a supportive partner with a 
similar investment philosophy. It will have two representatives on the board, which will "in many respects . . . have a 
governance structure similar to a [publicly listed company], with a rich mix of executives".
Board support might be particularly useful when dealing with customers such as Ryanair. The airline said yesterday 
that it planned to shrink its traffic into and out of Stansted by 9 per cent this year, in retaliation for a fare rise that 
had been proposed by the airport's former owner.

Body
Just 13 months have passed since Malev went bankrupt , consigning the 66-year-old Hungarian flag carrier to 
history. Now the race is on to prevent the same fate befalling a bigger and even older name: Lot, the Polish national 
airline.
The state-owned carrier is due to present a restructuring plan this month, expected to include big lay-offs and a 
reshaping of the company and its routes. The plan follows Lot's plea last December for as much as 1bn zlotys 
($315m) in aid, with the government agreeing to an emergency 400m zlotys cash injection - and sacking the chief 
executive, Marcin Pirog.
But Malev's and Lot's problems are mirrored at lossmaking airlines across "emerging" Europe: the Czech 
government has since November renewed efforts to sell Czech Airlines (CSA), with Korean Air Lines and Qatar 
Airways showing interest; Latvia's Air Baltic advertised a 50 per cent stake for sale in the Financial Times last 
August; Estonia's government has said closing Estonian Air is an option; and Serbia has tried to tempt Abu Dhabi-
based Etihad to buy Jat Airways.
In western Europe, flag carriers have largely, though not all, been consolidated by a few large groups - notably 
Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, and British Airways and Iberia parent International Airlines Group. Further east, they 
remain almost entirely unconsolidated, and often state dominated.
Though state-owned airlines can be inefficient and poorly run at the best of times, those that came out of the 
communist world had a particularly awkward legacy. Often they have been kept alive since by bailouts awarded on 
political rather than commercial grounds. National airlines were, after all, an important badge of nationhood for 
sometimes newly independent countries.
That has made it all the more difficult to cope with the extended European slowdown coupled with continually rising 
fuel prices. And they are stranded in the aviation equivalent of no-man's-land.
Flag carriers head for hangar in emerging Europe
On one side, they face competition from agile and thrifty low-cost airlines - not just easyJet and Ryanair, but 
homegrown competition such as Hungary-based Wizz Air. Ryanair was swift to fill at least part of the gap at 
Budapest's Ferenc Liszt airport left by Malev's bankruptcy.
On the other, European mega-carriers suck central European passengers into their west European hubs for long-
haul flights. Emirates, Qatar and others are starting to do the same on Asian routes.
In the EU's "new" states, moreover, membership has been distinctly double-edged for airlines. Competition rules 
restrict governments' ability to hand out state aid. A European Commission demand last year to pay back 
EUR332m of aid finally brought Malev crashing to earth. Brussels in December began probing aid to Air Baltic and 
Slovenia's Adria Airways, and last month aid to Estonian Air - and must still approve aid to Lot.
Then there is the rule that non-EU airlines cannot own EU carriers. That scuppered a potential tie-up of Lot with 
Turkish Airlines last June. With west European carriers busy consolidating their previous acquisitions, that rule is a 
big hurdle for those potentially most interested in acquiring central European airlines: middle eastern or Asian 
airlines in search of European hubs.
Without a market upturn, or painful restructuring - or both - several more central and eastern European carriers risk 
following Malev into aviation history. And national airlines are more than symbols of statehood. Not having one, and 
hence losing direct flights to trading partners, can have real costs, as Hungary has found. But governments can no 
longer afford to subsidise them - even were Brussels to allow it. Poland's premier, Donald Tusk, has declared that 
the government is not prepared to save Lot "at any cost".
There are still strategic niches to be exploited; the company that owns Prague airport and CSA Czech Airlines has 
had some success turning Prague into a hub for the former Soviet Union and points east. But sweeping 
restructuring is needed, if only to get these airlines in shape to interest west European carriers once they return to 
buying. Sub-regional consolidation needs to happen, too. A single Baltic airline would make sense, as would 
merging carriers from former Yugoslav states.
Cutting jobs, capacity and routes is politically tricky - as is meaningful co-operation between states that two 
decades ago were at war. But Malev now stands as a cautionary tale. The political cost of getting national airlines 
into shape to survive, even as part of much bigger groups - so safeguarding national airports, too - is probably a lot 
less than the fallout from seeing them fail.

Body
Ryanair today said it will cut its services to and from Stansted Airport in England because the airport authority has 
increased its charges.
The Irish airline will cut its London Stansted traffic by 9pc over the coming year (from 12.5m to 11.4m) after the 
Ferrovial/BAA Stansted operator announced a further increase of Stansted's charges of 6pc from April 2013.
The charges increase comes despite the fact that Ferrovial/BAA has sold Stansted to Manchester Airport Group 
(MAG) who will take over the airport sometime before the end of March.
Ryanair has called on Stansted's regulator, the CAA, to investigate whether this 6pc price hike was a "sweetener" 
for Ferrovial/BAA's sale of Stansted, which raised £1.5bn in proceeds for Ferrovial, despite the fact that Stansted's 
traffic has declined from 24m p.a. to 17.5m p.a. over the last 6 years. Ryanair, which had planned to grow its 
Stansted traffic by 5pc from April 2013, will now cut frequencies on 43 of its routes and reduce its weekly operations 
by over 170 flights, with the loss of 1.1m passengers (-9pc) and over 1,100 jobs at Stansted. Ryanair's Robin Kiely 
said, "It's bad enough that Ferrovial/BAA has doubled prices over the past 6 years and presided over record traffic 
falls at Stansted, but it appears that the CAA now rewards this commercial failure by allowing Ferrovial/BAA to 
again raise fees in 2013 to compensate for its traffic declines in 2012. Given that Ferrovial/BAA has now agreed to 
sell the airport to MAG, it is impossible to understand why the BAA monopoly is again raising Stansted's prices from 
April 2013 when it clearly won't be running the airport from that date. Ryanair and other Stansted airlines now must 
ask was this surprise price increase part of a "sweetener" package to persuade MAG to pay £1.5bn for Stansted? 
Are passengers and airlines at Stansted again being hit in order to boost the sales proceeds for the Spanish giant, 
Ferrovial, from the sale of BAA Stansted?"

The charges increase comes despite the fact that Ferrovial/BAA has sold Stansted to Manchester Airport Group 
(MAG) who will take over the airport sometime before the end of March.
Ryanair has called on Stansted's regulator, the CAA, to investigate whether this 6pc price hike was a "sweetener" 
for Ferrovial/BAA's sale of Stansted, which raised £1.5bn in proceeds for Ferrovial, despite the fact that Stansted's 
traffic has declined from 24m p.a. to 17.5m p.a. over the last 6 years. Ryanair, which had planned to grow its 
Stansted traffic by 5pc from April 2013, will now cut frequencies on 43 of its routes and reduce its weekly operations 
by over 170 flights, with the loss of 1.1m passengers (-9pc) and over 1,100 jobs at Stansted. Ryanair's Robin Kiely 
said, "It's bad enough that Ferrovial/BAA has doubled prices over the past 6 years and presided over record traffic 
falls at Stansted, but it appears that the CAA now rewards this commercial failure by allowing Ferrovial/BAA to 
again raise fees in 2013 to compensate for its traffic declines in 2012. Given that Ferrovial/BAA has now agreed to 
sell the airport to MAG, it is impossible to understand why the BAA monopoly is again raising Stansted's prices from 
April 2013 when it clearly won't be running the airport from that date. Ryanair and other Stansted airlines now must 
ask was this surprise price increase part of a "sweetener" package to persuade MAG to pay £1.5bn for Stansted? 
Are passengers and airlines at Stansted again being hit in order to boost the sales proceeds for the Spanish giant, 
Ferrovial, from the sale of BAA Stansted?"

Brussels formally vetoed Ryanair's latest takeover attempt for Aer Lingus   , arguing it raised "very serious 
competition problems," in the first case to date of the EU blocking a proposed merger twice.
Joaquín Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner, said he had no choice but to block a deal that "would have 
directly harmed passengers who would have had to pay higher fares as a result".
Ryanair, which has mounted three failed bids for the Irish flag carrier in eight years, denounced the move as 
"manifestly unjust" and politically inspired "to pander to the vested interests of the Irish government".
It is appealing against the decision, which will set a new precedent in Brussels and leave Ryanair accounting for 
almost 10 per cent of all EU merger prohibitions. Ryanair was unsuccessful in challenging the EU's 2007 
prohibition, which was upheld by the courts.
In his latest bid to win over Brussels, Michael O'Leary put forward a "revolutionary" package of competition 
remedies, which involved the de facto break-up of Aer Lingus. While this went well beyond past offers to win EU 
clearance for an airline merger, the European Commission still concluded the tie-up raised fundamental competition 
problems that would probably short-change consumers on choice and price.

Body
EU antitrust regulators yesterday formally blocked a third attempt by Ryanair to buy Irish rival Aer Lingus, a ruling 
Europe's biggest low-cost airline called politically motivated and vowed to challenge in court.
The European Commission, which vetoed Ryanair's first takeover bid for Aer Lingus in 2007, said Ryanair had not 
offered sufficient concessions to allay concerns about the combined company's dominance or monopoly on 46 
routes.
It said the (EURO)694m (£601m) bid, which was opposed by the Irish government, could hurt competition and lead 
to over 11m passengers paying more.
Ryanair, which owns 30 per cent of Aer Lingus and has been battling to buy Ireland's 75-year-old former flag carrier 
to strengthen its market position, had promised to divest some of Aer Lingus's routes to Flybe and British Airways in 
an attempt to win over regulators.
Ryanair described its concessions as unprecedented and rejected the Commission's arguments.
"We believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition," it said.
Flybe said the concessions "would have afforded credible and robust competition, including new jobs and bases in 
Ireland".

Body
The European Union's antitrust authority on Wednesday blocked Ryanair's renewed bid to take over rival Irish 
carrier Aer Lingus, ruling that it would undermine competition and drive up ticket prices.
The merger of the two Dublin-based airlines would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant 
position on almost 50 routes where Aer Lingus and Ryanair currently compete, said the EU Commission, the bloc's 
executive arm.
"This would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers traveling on 
these routes," it said, rejecting the remedies offered by Ryanair in return for a green light to its takeover bid.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline and already the biggest shareholder in Aer Lingus, vowed to appeal what it 
called a "political decision" designed to meet the interests of the Irish government. Its offer valued Aer Lingus at 
about (EURO)700 million ($900 million).
"At a time when airlines in Europe and further afield are merging to form bigger competition champions ... the EU 
Commission has yet again set back competition and choice in Europe while delaying much-needed consolidation," 
said Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely.
The Irish government has opposed Ryanair ever since the airline surprised virtually everyone by launching its initial 
bid for Aer Lingus in 2006 just days after the government floated it on the British and Irish stock exchanges. Ireland 
retained a 25 percent stake that it refused to sell to Ryanair.
So did Aer Lingus employee-controlled trusts that own more than 10 percent of shares. The unionized Aer Lingus 
work force views Ryanair with particular hostility because it refuses to recognize unions, and has a reputation for 
combative treatment of customers and employees alike.
Irish Transport Minister Leo Varadkar said a Ryanair-run Aer Lingus "would have a significant detrimental effect on 
competition, connectivity and employment in the Irish market."
EU blocks Ryanair bid to buy Ireland's Aer Lingus
The EU said both airlines combined would have controlled 87 percent of all short-haul flights out of Dublin, creating 
a dominant position on 18 routes and an "outright monopoly" on 28 others.
"The acquisition raised very significant competition concerns since it would have eliminated Ryanair's strongest 
competitor," said EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia.  "In the end the most likely outcome of this transaction would 
have been quite simple: When flying to and from Ireland, passengers ... would have ended up paying higher 
prices."
When Ryanair relaunched its takeover bid last year, it expressed hopes that Ireland would agree to sell its stake 
this time, given the fact that the debt-burdened government is seeking to sell billions in state assets as part of its 
effort to exit its 2010 international bailout. And Ryanair's detailed pitch to EU authorities included a framework 
agreement to sell key Aer Lingus routes to two British competitors, British Airways and Flybe.
Ryanair, which has surged ahead of Aer Lingus in Ireland with a larger work force and lower average fares, also 
promised to trim Aer Lingus ticket prices and increase employment while keeping Aer Lingus as a distinctive higher-
service brand with trans-Atlantic routes. Ryanair operates only in Europe, Morocco and the Canary Islands.
"We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns 
and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically inspired prohibition," Kiely 
said.
The EU Commission has cleared other large airline mergers or takeovers, including the British Airways-Iberia and 
Lufthansa-Austrian Airlines deals. But Almunia told reporters that Ryanair's bid was different because the two 
airlines operate principally in the same market and are both based in Dublin. He compared the situation to a 
proposed merger between two Greece-based airlines, Olympic and Aegean, that the EU blocked in 2011.
Aer Lingus cheered the EU's decision.
"Aer Lingus' position from the outset has been that Ryanair's offer should never have been made," chief executive 
Christoph Mueller said in a statement.
The airline is suing Ryanair in an effort to force its rival to divest its 30 percent stake. Britain's competition watchdog 
also is investigating whether Ryanair's investment in Aer Lingus unfairly influences its competitor's decisions. 
Ryanair holds no seats on the Aer Lingus board.

Body
The European Union's antitrust authority on Wednesday blocked budget airline Ryanair's renewed bid to take over 
Irish carrier Aer Lingus on grounds that it would undermine competition and drive up ticket prices.
The merger of the two leading airlines operating from Ireland would have harmed consumers by creating a 
monopoly or a dominant position on almost 50 routes where Aer Lingus and Ryanair are currently competing, said 
the EU Commission, the bloc's executive arm.
"This would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers travelling on 
these routes," it said, rejecting the remedies offered by Ryanair in return for a green light to its takeover bid.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, immediately said it will appeal the ruling, decrying it as a "political 
decision" bowing to the interests of the Irish government. Its offer valued Aer Lingus at about (EURO)700 million 
($900 million).
"At a time when airlines in Europe and further afield are merging to form bigger competition champions (...) the EU 
Commission has yet again set back competition and choice in Europe while delaying much-needed consolidation," 
Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said in a statement.
The Irish government, which holds a 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus, has opposed the takeover bid. It feared job 
losses at the former state carrier and said the takeover would give Ryanair, among others, a dominant position for 
flights between Ireland and Britain.
The EU said both airlines combined would control 87 percent of all short-haul flights out of Dublin, creating a 
dominant position on 18 routes and an "outright monopoly" on 28 others.
"The acquisition raised very significant competition concerns since it would have eliminated Ryanair's strongest 
competitor," said EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia.  "In the end the most likely outcome of this transaction would 
have been quite simple: When flying to and from Ireland, passengers ... would have ended up paying higher 
prices," he added.
EU blocks Ryanair bid to take over Aer Lingus
Ryanair, Aer Lingus' biggest shareholder with a 30 percent stake, first tried to take over the Irish carrier in 2006 but 
was blocked by the EU Commission. The company has since resubmitted its bid, insisting Europe's airline 
landscape was changing rapidly with regional airlines failing and larger ones merging to remain profitable. The 
company also claimed that the takeover would drive down average ticket prices.
"We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns 
and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition," Kiely 
said.
The Commission has recently cleared large airline mergers or takeovers, such as those between British Airways 
and Iberia or Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines. But Almunia told reporters the Ryanair case was different because 
the two airlines are operating on the same market with Dublin as an important hub for both. The case therefore was 
similar to the proposed merger between the Greece-based airlines Olympic and Aegean, which the EU also blocked 
in 2011, he said.
Aer Lingus cheered the EU's decision.
"Aer Lingus' position from the outset has been that Ryanair's offer should never have been made," chief executive 
Christoph Mueller said in a statement.
The airline has also sued Ryanair in an effort to force its rival to divest its 30 percent stake. It says an investigation 
by Britain's competition watchdog examining the stake is still pending.
Aer Lingus has struggled in recent years to slash costs sufficiently to compete with Ryanair, which is Europe's 
fastest-growing airline. It has suffered regular battles with labor unions, whereas Ryanair doesn't recognize them.

Ryanair will appeal today's decision by Europe's anti-monopoly watchdog to block its third takeover bid for Aer 
Lingus, potentially leaving the fate of its Irish rival in limbo for years.
The rebuff was expected after Ryanair said earlier this month the EU Commission had told it of its intention to block 
the 694-million-euro bid to seize control of Ireland's 75-year-old former flag carrier.
The veto, which is the first time the Commission has twice rejected a proposed takeover, was expected to force 
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary to decide whether to finally set its smaller rival free by selling its 30 percent stake.
But by following through on a threat to try to be the first company in a decade to overturn an EU anti-monopoly 
decision, Ryanair could tie up the stake for years and stymie the Irish government's efforts to offload its own 25 
percent holding. "We believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired 
prohibition," a Ryanair spokesman said in a statement. "We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by 
narrow political interests rather than competition concerns ... Accordingly, Ryanair has instructed its legal advisers 
to prepare a comprehensive appeal." The bid, described by Ryanair as its third and final effort to takeover its rival, 
included ceding 43 routes to a newly created Irish subsidiary of British airline Flybe (FLYB.L) and handing to British 
Airways (ICAG.L) the routes Aer Lingus operates from London's Gatwick Airport. The Commission blocked 
Ryanair's first attempt to take over Aer Lingus in 2007 and Ryanair dropped its second in 2009.

earlier this month the EU Commission had told it of its intention to block the 694-million-euro bid to seize control of 
Ireland's 75-year-old former flag carrier. The veto, which is the first time the Commission has twice rejected a 
proposed takeover, was expected to force Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary to decide whether to finally set its smaller 
rival free by selling its 30 percent stake. But by following through on a threat to try to be the first company in a 
decade to overturn an EU anti-monopoly decision, Ryanair could tie up the stake for years and stymie the Irish 
government's efforts to offload its own 25 percent holding. Ryanair stocks fell nearly 1pc or 6c to E5.61 while Aer 
Lingus gained 1c to E1.25.
CRH shares fell 6c to E16.62. Holcim has reported adjusted fourth quarter EBITDA of CHF1,019m (+2pc yoy) 
versus Bloomberg consensus of CHF973m (4-5pc ahead). However, this is before restructuring costs of CHF181m 
(which look higher than expected) and is on the back of lfl sales growth of 2pc (versus 3pc Q3 and 6pc H1). For the 
FY EBITDA was up 6pc before restructuring costs (flat when included). "In terms of CRH there is no additional 
information at a regional level but it is another set of results that highlight the diverging trends between Europe and 
US. Underlying sales in Europe were down 5pc in both Q4 and FY, while North America was up 2pc in Q4 and 
+3pc FY. We expect these trends to continue in 2013 resulting in single-digit EBITDA growth for CRH," according to

Body
EU Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquin Almunia today said that the decision to 
reject Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus was done in the best interests of the travelling public.
The European Commission earlier today prohibited the proposed takeover of the Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus by the 
low-cost airline Ryanair.
It said that the acquisition would have combined the two leading airlines operating from Ireland.
"The Commission concluded that the merger would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant 
position on 46 routes where, currently, Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete vigorously against each other. This would 
have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers travelling on these routes. 
During the investigation, Ryanair offered remedies. The Commission assessed them thoroughly and carried out 
several market tests. However the remedies proposed fell short of addressing the competition concerns raised by 
the Commission," it found. Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquin Almunia said: "The 
Commission's decision protects more than 11 million Irish and European passengers who travel each year to and 
from Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon. For them, the acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have most likely 
led to higher fares. During the procedure, Ryanair had many opportunities to offer remedies and to improve them. 
However, those proposals were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this 
acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes." Ryanair and Aer Lingus are by far the most important 
carriers operating out of Ireland. They compete directly on 46 routes. In a statement, Aer Lingus welcomed the 
decision. "Aer Lingus Group plc welcomes the decision announced today by the European Commission (EC) 
prohibiting Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus. This is the first occasion on which the EC has needed to block the same 
deal twice. It is also Ryanair's third failed offer for Aer Lingus. The full text of the EC's announcement and frequently 
asked questions are linked below," it said. It was the third time that the proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus by 
Almunia: Ryanair bid bar protects public; Ryanair Reject
Ryanair was notified to the Commission. In 2007 the Commission prohibited Ryanair's first attempt to acquire Aer 
Lingus and this decision was upheld by the EU General Court. In 2009, the second notification by Ryanair was 
withdrawn. "The Commission took into account the changes in market circumstances since 2007, for example the 
fact that the market positions of Ryanair and Aer Lingus have become even stronger, with their combined market 
shares going up from 80pc in 2007 to 87pc in 2012 for short-haul flights out of Dublin. The number of routes to and 
from Ireland operated in competition by Ryanair and Aer Lingus has increased from 35 in 2007 to 46 in 2012."

Ryanair To Appeal EU Commission's Decision To Prohibit Offer For Aer Lingus

Body
(RTTNews) - Ireland-based Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) confirmed that it will appeal the EU 
Commission's announced decision to prohibit its latest offer for Aer Lingus Group Plc. (AERL.L), which was 
supported by remedies package that included not one, but two upfront buyers (BA/IAG & Flybe) to take over 
approximately half of Aer Lingus' short-haul business.
The company said that transfer to these upfront buyers of Aer Lingus' business on the 46 crossover routes 
identified by the EU Commission, together with the relevant slots, aircraft, personnel and branding, was ensured by 
binding, irrevocable commitments by those upfront buyers including Board approvals.
Ryanair Holdings said that the history of the EU's treatment of Ryanair's two offers for Aer Lingus conclusively 
proved that this prohibition is a "political" decision to pander to the vested interests of the Irish Government, a 
minority 25% shareholder in Aer Lingus, and was not one that was based on a fair and reasonable application of 
EU competition rules or precedent airline merger approvals in Europe.
In a separate press release, Aer Lingus Group said it welcomes the decision announced by the European 
Commission prohibiting Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus. This is the first occasion on which the EC has needed to 
block the same deal twice. It is also Ryanair's third failed offer for Aer Lingus.

 Ryanair Holdings PLC (Nasdaq:RYAAY) on Wednesday vowed to appeal the European Commission's decision to 
block Ryanair's third attempt to become the sole owner of Aer Lingus Group PLC (LON:AERA).
 The EC on Wednesday said Ryanair's third takeover attempt of Aer Lingus, worth $904 million, would be blocked 
because consolidation would harm air travelers by creating a monopoly of 46 regional routes. Ryanair currently 
holds almost 30 percent of Aer Lingus; the Irish government holds a 25 percent stake.

Boris's hub is short of billions
Some confusion over London Mayor Boris Johnson's planned tour of the Middle East to raise funds for a new 
super-hub airport in the Thames Estuary, with the London Evening Standard claiming he will attempt to raise up to 
£80 million ($145 million) from Gulf states to cover "the cost of terminals, runways, ancillary facilities and rail and 
road access".
Now £80 million might seem a number with a lot of noughts in it, but it is not going to get you very far when it comes 
to building an international airport: Heathrow's Terminal 5 alone cost over £4 billion.
We reckon £80 million might just about see Boris right if he had a landing strip with a few prefab hangars in mind for 
his global hub.
The Standard's online version makes a bit more sense, adding three noughts to the £80 million estimate, although 
by the time you get to paragraph three, it's back to seven figures again. Oh, well, Boris, there's always "London" 
Manston.
A fare bet
Ryanair's latest revenue wheeze? Giving passengers their money back. Just one hitch. For a chance of winning the 
price of your ticket, you have to stump up an extra E3, E4, or E5 when you make your booking...assuming - before 
taxes, baggage and booking fee - your original ticket cost more than that.
Ryanair is pretty cagey on what the odds are, although it says it guarantees three winners a week.
Having a flutter on one of Mr O'Leary's horses might be a better bet.
Count them in

The latest aircraft to arrive at the soon-to-open Classic Air Force collection at Newquay Cornwall airport is this 
former Swiss air force de Havilland Vampire twin-seat trainer, G-HELV (below).
The Vampire, with its distinctive twin boom, was the second jet fighter to enter service with the RAF, although it 
arrived too late to see combat during the Second World War.
Almost 3,300 were built, a quarter of them under licence overseas. The Classic Air Force opens at the end of

On the subject of museums, some good news from Brooklands in Weybridge near London, run by Allan Winn, 
formerly of this parish.
It has been awarded £4.85 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund for a project to relocate and restore the museum's 
listed Wellington Hangar as the Brooklands Aircraft Factory, with a new annexe to house more of its collection of 
historic aircraft.
As part of the plan, the original racetrack - on which the hangar currently stands - will also be restored.

Boris's hub is short of billions
Some confusion over London Mayor Boris Johnson's planned tour of the Middle East to raise funds for a new 
super-hub airport in the Thames Estuary, with the London Evening Standard claiming he will attempt to raise up to 
[pounds sterling]80 million ($145 million) from Gulf states to cover "the cost of terminals, runways, ancillary facilities 
and rail and road access".
Now [pounds sterling]80 million might seem a number with a lot of noughts in it, but it is not going to get you very far 
when it comes to building an international airport: Heathrow's Terminal 5 alone cost over [pounds sterling]4 billion.
We reckon [pounds sterling]80 million might just about see Boris right if he had a landing strip with a few prefab 
hangars in mind for his global hub.
The Standard's online version makes a bit more sense, adding three noughts to the [pounds sterling]80 million 
estimate, although by the time you get to paragraph three, it's back to seven figures again. Oh, well, Boris, there's 
always "London" Manston.
A fare bet
Ryanair's latest revenue wheeze? Giving passengers their money back. Just one hitch. For a chance of winning the 
price of your ticket, you have to stump up an extra [euro]3, [euro]4, or [euro]5 when you make your 
booking...assuming - before taxes, baggage and booking fee - your original ticket cost more than that.
Ryanair is pretty cagey on what the odds are, although it says it guarantees three winners a week.
Having a flutter on one of Mr O'Leary's horses might be a better bet.
Count them in
Boris's hub is short of billions.
The latest aircraft to arrive at the soon-to-open Classic Air Force collection at Newquay Cornwall airport is this 
former Swiss air force de Havilland Vampire twin-seat trainer, G-HELV (below).
The Vampire, with its distinctive twin boom, was the second jet fighter to enter service with the RAF, although it 
arrived too late to see combat during the Second World War.
Almost 3,300 were built, a quarter of them under licence overseas. The Classic Air Force opens at the end of 
March.

Sales of used commercial jets remain buoyant

Order backlog for Boeing and Airbus
Carriers seek to expand capacity
Body
The second-hand market for narrow-body commercial aircraft is forecast to remain buoyant over the coming 
decade, in spite of strong demand from airlines for new, more fuel efficient models due to enter service in three or 
four years' time.
This is in contrast to past shifts to new models, for example in the 2000s, when the value of second-hand Boeing 
narrow-body jets fell amid a transition by airlines to the US manufacturer's "next-generation" aircraft.
Airbus Neo and Boeing Max models, which both boast about a 15 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency, "are 
essentially re-engined aircraft. They have similar seat numbers and the same range as their predecessors, which 
makes the switchover much less disruptive," said Lucas Mollan, chief technical officer at Avolon, the aircraft leasing 
company, and author of a paper on the upcoming transition. "Airlines will be able to 'bleed' these models into their 
existing fleets."
The Avolon paper also found that the impact of the Neo and Max models on the value of their predecessors will be 
limited by the sheer number of current-generation craft in use today and the high portion of the global aircraft fleet 
approaching retirement. "A deep and renewable pool of ageing aircraft will be available to absorb the replacement 
element of new deliveries, expected to average 40 per cent of the total over the next decade."
Mr Mollan and Dick Forsberg, Avalon's head of strategy, argued that the greatest risk to an orderly transition was 
Airbus and Boeing ramping up production of the Neos and Maxes or failing to moderate production of older models 
at an appropriate rate - both because of the strain this could put on a supply chain already stretched at the moment 
and because of the possibility of it creating a glut in the market.
Sales of used commercial jets remain buoyant
Some airlines are already hoping to strike deals on current-generation aircraft, with many aviation experts expecting 
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, to put in an order soon for current generation Boeings rather than 
Maxes.
The Irish low-cost carrier and its UK-based rival easyJet are both looking this year at increasing their fleets to 
accommodate growth in passenger numbers, but are keen not to overspend in a period of moderating traffic growth 
in Europe.
The Avolon authors predict that sharper rises in passenger numbers in developing countries will fuel demand for 
both Neo and Max models, but also, importantly, current-generation aircraft as airlines seek to add capacity but find 
themselves at the end of long lines for the new models. Both Airbus and Boeing currently have record-high order 
backlogs, making the second-hand market an appealing option for fast-growing carriers.

International investors still have an appetite for investing in Irish listed companies through depository receipt (DR) 
programmes, according to figures from BNY Mellon released today.
A number of Irish-listed companies operate DR programmes, which allow investors to buy stocks in foreign 
companies through their local stock exchanges.
The Irish-listed companies that operate these programmes include CRH, Elan, Bank of Ireland, Kerry Group, 
Datalex, Greencore and Ryanair.
This means investors in the US and elsewhere can buy into these companies in dollars. BNY Mellon tracks the 
volume and value of dealings in American Depositary Receipts and has published figures for 2012 that show an 
increase in the volume of shares traded in Irish companies to dollar 16.6 billion. Elan remains one of the most 
actively traded US-listed DRs globally with 855 million shares traded with a value of dollar 10.5 billion - up from 
dollar 8.2 billion in 2011. One of the biggest movers year-on-year was drinks group C and C which saw international 
investors trading 1.8 million shares (compared to just 30,000 two years ago) to the value of dollar 24 million (dollar 
31,000 in 2010). This trend was replicated globally with the beverage sector outperforming all other sectors with an 
18pc increase in trading volume during 2012. According the Christopher M Kearns, deputy CEO of BNY Mellon's 
Depository Receipts business, "International portfolio diversification through Depository Receipts has offered a 
viable option to many investors, even as geopolitics led to periods of unsettled markets and made companies 
cautious about committing capital." A total of 157 billion DRs were traded on the world's markets and exchanges, 
10pc less than 2011, but higher than the previous two years, while the overall value of DRs traded shrank 26pc to 
dollar 2.79 trillion. The BNY Mellon Classic ADR index posted an 18pc return last year, beating the 16pc gain by 
Standard and Poor's 500 Index of US shares. The returns for Europe were up more than 20pc last year. Overall,

The Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) today welcomed the recommendation in the Government's Action Plan for Jobs to 
help Irish companies grow through the IPO route and become the successful publicly-quoted companies of the 
future.
ISE Chief Executive Deirdre Somers said the new initiative will be an essential step in identifying the challenges 
facing mid-size companies and creating the next generation of heavyweight Irish publicly-quoted companies.
"Ireland needs more success stories such as Ryanair, Kerry Group and Paddy Power - high-quality, scalable 
businesses that can create jobs and help Ireland recover. This new initiative will help Ireland to address the IPO 
challenge," said Ms Somers.
"Scale matters. Over 90pc of employment growth in companies takes place post-IPO. We rightly applaud 
successful indigenous companies when they conclude a trade sale to a foreign buyer - but there is much more to be 
gained for the Irish economy if some of these companies can become leading publicly-quoted companies in their 
own right". Ms Somers, who has been calling for Government action on this issue for some time, said she looked 
forward to making a positive contribution to support the initiative. "Until now, there has been a common view that 
almost every Irish high-potential company will be sold to a trade buyer - but that must change. There will be clear 
benefits to the Irish economy if we can implement specific measures that will support more Irish companies in their 
efforts to achieve scale. Markets go through cycles and they will rebound. We need to have Irish companies ready 
to benefit from this." Ms Somers said Enterprise Ireland has achieved great success in developing home-grown 
businesses and that its skills and expertise will be crucial in helping companies achieve scale in the years ahead.

EU regulators will decide next week on Ryanair's third attempt to take over Aer Lingus , the EU's antitrust chief said 
today, a decision that Europe's top no-frills airline has already said will be negative.
Ryanair said last week the European Commission, which oversees competition in the 27 EU member states, would 
block its latest takeover bid for Aer Lingus, criticising such a move as political and one it would challenge in court.
The Commission will announce its decision next week, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told 
Reuters.
"The decision is on Feb. 27," he told Reuters, without giving details of the outcome. A veto would be Almunia's 
fourth rejection of a proposed merger in three years. Last month he blocked plans by world leading package 
delivery company UPS to acquire Dutch rival TNT Express. Ryanair had offered to pay 100 million euros, transfer 
nine planes and cede 43 routes to strengthen British rival Flybe in a bid to secure EU regulatory approval. The 
proposal included Flybe setting up an Irish airline, with Ryanair providing forward sales cash and liabilities worth 
around 50 million euros. A source close to the deal said Ryanair was also willing to give up Aer Lingus' routes at 
London's Gatwick Airport to British Airways. The EU competition authority blocked Ryanair's first takeover bid in 
2007. The airline abandoned a second attempt in 2009. The Irish government, which holds a 25 percent stake in 
Aer Lingus, opposes Ryanair's bid.

Bulletin
**Michael O'Leary's dogged pursuit of Aer Lingus is looking more and more like an expensive mistake after the 
European Commission blocked the deal again last week.**
**The Ryanair chief executive was less interested in grabbing enhanced profit than in buying his way to a new 
strategic direction with a new brand and transatlantic routes.**
**The likely end of O'Leary's attention will come as a huge relief to Aer Lingus chief Christoph Mueller, who has 
spent a fortune defending his airline against the hostile bid.**
**Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus may now make it hard for the government to sell its share in the carrier, while 
O'Leary now needs a new plan in order to hit his ambitious targets.**
.....
Back in 2006, it looked like the smartest business coup ever. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary shocked the 
market and caught Aer Lingus management, staff and the government completely by surprise when he started 
buying up shares in the airline. After dismissing it for years, he suddenly owned 16 per cent of the former national 
carrier, and later increased that stake to 29.8 per cent -- just shy of the mandatory takeover threshold.
After nearly seven years, a EUR 300 million writedown and three unsuccessful takeover bids, it might not seem 
such a clever move anymore. But there was a genuine feeling in Ryanair and elsewhere in the aviation sector in 
recent weeks that O'Leary might just pull it off and get a green light from the European Commission for his third bid. 
Given that the government had already said it wouldn't sell its own 25 per cent stake, O'Leary was looking at a best-
case scenario of majority control.
O'Leary's pricey pursuit
The Ryanair chief executive's determination to acquire the former state airline is probably not shared by all senior 
management at Ryanair, and some in the boardroom may even be downright perplexed. Sources have suggested 
that some shareholders have questioned in recent months why the Aer Lingus bid was being pursued for a third 
time, especially when it would require such expensive and complex remedies even to stand a chance of going 
ahead.
Such views have been expressed at senior levels within Ryanair in recent months. But O'Leary's track record at 
Ryanair carries such sway around the boardroom, and in the market, that everybody was willing to indulge him in 
what he sees as a worthwhile financial pursuit.
It looks, once again, as if the deal won't happen. Ryanair will go ahead with its planned appeal of the EU decision, 
something which could take two to three years. Detractors of O'Leary's stance can point to the fact that the whole 
Aer Lingus saga has, so far, cost the company around EUR 400 million. The buyout price, plus the cost of the 
remedies proposed by Ryanair, could have brought the whole cost to close to EUR 1 billion.
For all that expenditure, Ryanair would have landed a slice of the Aer Lingus route network or a business that is 
generating an operating profit of just EUR 20 million to EUR 30 million per year.
So why did O'Leary want it so badly? Some argue that he clearly saw a genuine business opportunity, even when 
the proposed remedies are included. However, O'Leary has been the one driving this acquisition most strongly.
"He really wanted it," said one source. "Ireland is just one profit centre for Ryanair, of which there are many. But 
O'Leary is very plugged in to things here. He is very focused on it and would genuinely have seen an opportunity to 
build a very strong Irish airline."
O'Leary travels a lot around Europe practically every week with his job. But, on a personal level, he is not 
particularly interested in international travel. "He is not the kind of guy who wants to go and see the Grand Canyon 
or the Far East. He likes being in Ireland," the source added.
Some industry sources have said that, while the whole Aer Lingus bid has been a sizeable and fruitless distraction 
for the senior management team of a very large international business, O'Leary structured it so that it wouldn't draw 
too much attention away from day-to-day operations.
"The bid team was a very small group led by O'Leary," one source said. "The rest of senior management were not 
dragged into it, and so they have not been distracted from running the business."
Similarly, industry observers disagree with the analysis that the appeal, if it goes ahead, will distract management 
for another two or three years. "No. For the appeal, it will simply be handed over to the lawyers," the source added. 
"They are the ones who will be running the appeal."
In an Irish context, the Ryanair/Aer Lingus deal was highly significant. But from a Ryanair perspective, it wasn't 
really that big a deal at all. In 2006, when Ryanair made its first offer for Aer Lingus, the former state airline carried 
around 8.6 million passengers annually. Ryanair carried 35 million. Since then, Aer Lingus grew to carry 9.6 million 
passengers in 2012, while Ryanair carried around 79 million.
In the overall scheme of things, and in terms of strategic focus, an airline the size of Aer Lingus should not have 
warranted so much of Ryanair's corporate attention over the last few years. However, Ryanair's rapid growth has 
slowed more recently. The company needs a new trick, or even a new bag of tricks.
It has set a target for itself of growing from 80 million passengers to 120 million in the next seven years. "This is a 
really big challenge, and the company will have to figure out the different ways it is going to achieve that," one 
industry source said.
Ryanair plans to place a major order for new aircraft which will increase capacity by around 50 per cent. Its plan 
may include tie-ups with other airlines either through acquisition, the use of other brands or the launch of a 
transatlantic service.
O'Leary's pricey pursuit
The acquisition of Aer Lingus would have given Ryanair a foothold in all three of those future building strategies -- 
an acquisition, a different brand, and transatlantic routes. However, whether it would have been worth paying close 
to EUR 1 billion for that is another matter.
Assuming that the acquisition does not go ahead following an appeal, O'Leary has to sit down and figure out how 
he is going to meet these ambitious targets elsewhere and in other ways.
O'Leary knows that the airline industry is risky. Every time you put another plane on a route, you are taking a EUR 
50 million punt that it will work financially. However, there is something inherently conservative about how his airline 
goes about its business. All its planes are the same: there is no deviation from the core business or the core model.
If O'Leary is to grow the business by another 50 per cent in the next seven years, however, it may require several 
jumps into the unknown. At least, in trying to buy Aer Lingus, O'Leary knew what he would be getting. He knows the 
brand, the market, the customer and the company extremely well. Without Aer Lingus, he may have to do some 
things in a slightly less conservative way. Despite this, Aer Lingus would have been hard work.
"Many people in the company will have breathed a sigh of relief at the news that the European Commission said 
no," said a source.
"O'Leary would have had to roll up his sleeves with the challenges of Aer Lingus, implementing the complex 
remedies, dealing with the trade unions and the pension deficit. It was going to be a huge burden."
If the Ryanair bids have been a distraction for O'Leary, they have been an obsession for Aer Lingus management. 
Christoph Mueller and his top executives have had Ryanair sitting on their shoulder for six and a half years. The 
fact that the business is well-run and delivering profits helped to strengthen its case against a takeover. It recently 
had the biggest single day of revenue in its financial history.
There is a view that the future of Aer Lingus is now very much up in the air, so to speak. O'Leary might sell his 
stake and, when combined with the sale of the government's 25 per cent, the company is in play. The reality may 
be very different.
It is unlikely O'Leary will sell his stake while the appeal is running and while there is even a slight chance he could 
win. The only way he will sell is if he gets a really good price.
The government has committed, in discussions with the troika, to selling its 25 per cent. But don't hold your breath 
for a sale here. So far, it has done very little to pro-actively go about selling down the stake. It would have an ideal 
excuse, in the form of the Ryanair appeal, to tell the troika that it can't find a buyer. We may see very little change at 
Aer Lingus in the next two to three years, following this European Commission ruling.
Aer Lingus shares fell slightly after news broke of the "no" from Brussels. Ryanair shares have been little affected. 
Some punters bought into Aer Lingus on the back of good profits and a chance the deal might be allowed go 
ahead. They decided to take their profit last week. Ryanair investors have been less distracted by the bid than 
O'Leary has. They will not have lost faith in the chief executive, because the company has continued to deliver 
operationally while all of this has been going on.
But now that the long-mooted takeover has been virtually put to bed, they will be watching closely to see what the 
aviation mogul has up his sleeve to reach his new, hugely ambitious targets.

TPG Capital, the private equity firm run by Ryanair chairman David Bonderman, is one of four international 
investors preparing bids for a EUR 270 million portfolio of assets linked to Treasury Holdings.
Northwood Investors, Kennedy Wilson and Blackstone are also preparing bids for the Opera CMH portfolio, which 
includes major Irish assets such as the Stillorgan Shopping Centre and Bank of Ireland's headquarters on Mespil 
Road.
Northwood, the fund set up by former Blackstone real estate head John Kukral, is believed to have submitted its 
proposal already, according to Property Week magazine.
Northwood previously bought Nama's EUR 85 million of junior debt linked to the portfolio, and is viewed as a front 
runner for the deal.
However, Bonderman's TPG has been buying up debt linked to the Opera portfolio, which strengthens its hand in 
the process.
The deal is highly complex. Treasury borrowed EUR 375 million to fund investment deals through its related 
vehicle, Real Estates Opportunities (REO).
The German lender Eurohypo organised the bond, which was snapped up by various investors.
The portfolio behind the bond was once valued at EUR 575 million, but is now worth in the region of EUR 270 
million. The debt matured in January and, with Treasury in financial difficulty, it has now come to the market.
Treasury, owned by the developers Johnny Ronan and Richard Barrett, has debts of EUR 2.7 billion.
A liquidator was appointed to the property giant late last year. Nama has since taken possession of a string of 
Treasury sites.

A qualified engineer, Ailish Ryan is a director of Mocks.ie, an online resource for exam students that she co-
founded with her brother, Eoghain, in 2010. The Mocks website and app feature exam resources like revision notes 
and written, oral and aural exam testing. Also included is feedback from state examiners and practical tools like 
study timetables and past paper analysis. Ryan is also a director of Ryan & Associates, a Galway-based 
engineering consultancy in operation since 2006.
..........................
**What are the main responsibilities of your job?**
My brother and I run Mocks.ie, which allows students to take mock exams online and access revision notes and 
exam advice. We also have a chartered engineering consultancy. Business development is my main concern -- 
making sure the website works for students, is easily accessible and suits their lifestyle. Things like having the free 
app downloads and podcasts to complement the website are important. Managing staff and managing cashflow 
also absorb a lot of time. If you get either wrong, it can be a disaster.
**What motivates you in your job?**
Getting good results for Mocks.ie, which has close to 50,000 visitors every month and 150 app downloads daily. 
Advertisers are now coming to us to use Mocks.ie to reach a sought-after demographic. In our first year, it was a 
struggle getting any advertising at all. Hearing about kids who have done really well in exams having used Mocks.ie 
makes us proud too. Sitting exams is really stressful, no matter how bright a student is, so being able to practice 
exam questions over and over online, and rehearsing oral and aural exams, makes a major difference.
**How would you describe your work style?**
Methodical normally, but a little disorganised at the moment because there aren't enough hours in the day.
Working Week
**What is the most valuable professional lesson you have learned?**
Work hard and stick to your business plan. Don't celebrate anything until the cash is in the bank -- this is a lesson I 
learned the hard way.
**In Ireland, whose career do you most admire and why?**
It would have to be Michael O'Leary of Ryanair, because he is a shrewd operator and, although controversial, he 
tells it as it is. If we had more straight talkers like him, Ireland might not be in the mess it is.
**Based on your experience, what is the most valuable career advice you can offer others?**
Take risks. Embarrassment lasts a day, but regret lasts a lifetime.
**In terms of doing business in Ireland, what do you think is the biggest challenge we face? What would you like to 
see change?**
Negativity and short-sightedness. I would like to see people think more positively and embrace modern technology 
to move with the times. Less red tape would also be great and, if the politicians are listening, 23 per cent Vat on 
ebooks is crazy, particularly for educational texts. There is no Vat on paper books, and we are supposed to be 
moving forward with technology.
What is your ultimate professional goal at this point?
I would like to see every exam student in Ireland using Mocks.ie to waltz through their exams with support and 
confidence.

Forget "ring, ring" - here is a phone that goes "bling, bling". Vertu  released the Ti, its first new handset since it was 
spun out of Nokia  and sold to EQT  last year. The entry level model is priced at a cool £7,000, which buys a 
titanium frame and a ruby button that dials a concierge service. A crocodile skin version costs £3,000 extra.
Michael O'Leary, the outspoken boss of Ryanair , would have done well to remember the adage "once bitten, twice 
shy". The European Commission told the Irish airline it would again block its bid for Aer Lingus on competition 
grounds - the first time Brussels has ever vetoed a merger twice.
Spare a thought for poor G4S , virtually alone in having a bad Olympics after it failed to provide enough security 
guards for the event. Having initially expected to make a £10m profit on the £284m contract, it said this week this 
had turned into an £88m loss. No word yet on the cost of the damage to the company's reputation.
According to traditional Chinese medicine, a sore throat should be treated with a mixture of honeysuckle and the 
forsythia plant. Some westerners might question the efficacy of herbal remedies, but not Reckitt Benckiser , which 
bought the maker of a popular Chinese sore throat powder for an undisclosed sum.

The ISEQ is lower this morning at 3667, down 13 points as European markets mark time ahead of the G20 
meeting.
Where to Aer Lingus following the failed Ryanair bid, NCB discusses:
Aer Lingus has informed staff that it will halt all pay increases, including the payment of increments, until the 
pension dispute is resolved.
Analysis: The payment of increments and other pay increases has been on hold at the company for the past three 
years under a cost containment programme. Such increases were expected to resume in April this year. Aer Lingus 
has now proposed that for the next four years normal pay progression would be replaced by a stabilisation 
programme worth E16m. Aer Lingus argues that such a savings programme would enable it to invest in the pension 
scheme. Currently, the deficit of the IASS scheme stands at E789m. Changes to actuarial assumptions (discount 
rate, pensionable pay increases etc) could reduce the deficit signifcantly. This scheme includes both employees of 
Aer Lingus (two thirds) and the DAA (one third). Any final settlement is likey to see the burden shared some way 
between the company and the members of the scheme. It is reported that trade unions are seeking an investment 
of E130m by Aer Lingus into the scheme. Aer Lingus insists that it has no legal obligation to increase its 
contributions to the scheme, but to ensure better industrial relations some type of payment, most likely into a new 
scheme, is likely in our view. Conclusion & Action: Aer Lingus management has indicated that the pension deficit is 
a key issue that it is looking to resolve this year. While this latest move (halting pay increases) may prove 
provocative it is likely to concentrate minds, especially if it is followed up by direct discussions. We believe a 
reasonable settlement over the pension issue would be positive for the share price. The Irish Pensions Board 
requires also schemes in deficit to put in place a funding plan by this summer, so we would expect to see progress 
on this issue by then according to NCB Stockbrokers.

Ryanair today announced the purchase of a new office building in Airside Business Park in Swords, Co Dublin, 
which will become its new Dublin office.
The 100,000 sq ft building will house all of Ryanair's Irish operations, including its commercial, customer service, 
finance, IT, legal and marketing departments.
Ryanair will shortly begin the tendering process for the fit-out of the building and plans to move all of its Irish office 
operations and approximately 400 staff from its current offices at Dublin Airport to Airside before the end of 2013.
Ryanair will also be offering up to half (50,000 sq ft) of this building for rent to other high profile multi-national 
companies. The airline said it will continue to maintain some facilities at Dublin Airport for its pilots and cabin crew. 
"Ryanair is pleased to confirm the purchase of a new Dublin office building at Airside Business Park, Swords, Co 
Dublin. This brand new 100,000 sq ft state-of-the-art building will house all of Ryanair's Irish operations and some 
400 staff will be based there when we complete our move before the end of 2013," said Ryanair's Robin Kiely. "This 
is a significant investment by Ryanair, allowing us the space and facilities to further develop our Dublin 
organisation, at much lower costs than the high rents on the Dublin Airport campus and allowing other staff 
currently housed in satellite offices to be brought together under one roof, resulting in a large reduction in rental 
expenses and further cost savings. Ryanair's Airside Business Park relocation will also provide a welcome 
economic boost for the growing town of Swords, which continues to attract blue-chip corporations - including the 
world's largest airline."

Ryanair today announced the purchase of a new office building in Airside Business Park in Swords, Co Dublin, 
which will become its new Dublin office.
The 100,000 sq ft building will house all of Ryanair's Irish operations, including its commercial, customer service, 
finance, IT, legal and marketing departments.
Ryanair will shortly begin the tendering process for the fit-out of the building and plans to move all of its Irish office 
operations and approximately 400 staff from its current offices at Dublin Airport to Airside before the end of 2013.
Ryanair will also be offering up to half (50,000 sq ft) of this building for rent to other high profile multi-national 
companies. The airline said it will continue to maintain some facilities at Dublin Airport for its pilots and cabin crew. 
"Ryanair is pleased to confirm the purchase of a new Dublin office building at Airside Business Park, Swords, Co 
Dublin. This brand new 100,000 sq ft state-of-the-art building will house all of Ryanair's Irish operations and some 
400 staff will be based there when we complete our move before the end of 2013," said Ryanair's Robin Kiely. "This 
is a significant investment by Ryanair, allowing us the space and facilities to further develop our Dublin 
organisation, at much lower costs than the high rents on the Dublin Airport campus and allowing other staff 
currently housed in satellite offices to be brought together under one roof, resulting in a large reduction in rental 
expenses and further cost savings. Ryanair's Airside Business Park relocation will also provide a welcome 
economic boost for the growing town of Swords, which continues to attract blue-chip corporations - including the 
world's largest airline."

The High Court has confirmed an examiner to B and Q Ireland Ltd, which operates nine home improvement stores 
employing 690 people, of whom 500 are part-time workers.
As part of further cost-cutting proposals, the company's two stores in Athlone and Waterford would close with the 
"regrettable" loss of 92 jobs, Mr Justice Peter Kelly noted.
A key ingredient for the survival of some of the company's other stores includes renegotiation of what he described

rates, the court heard.

similar route taken by former Anglo Irish Bank chief executive David Drumm, who filed for bankruptcy in 
Massachusetts in 2010, avoiding proceedings taken by Anglo in this State, where the regime is more onerous than

Commission claims tie-up would lead to higher prices, say Alex Barker  and Andrew Parker
Body
Ryanair has lashed out at Brussels' "political" move to block its takeover of Aer Lingus, as the EU once again 
stymied chief executive Michael O'Leary's eight-year quest to buy the Irish flag carrier .
The European Commission yesterday told Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue, that it intends to 
veto a tie-up on the grounds that it would be likely to raise prices for consumers.
The final decision, which is issued next month, is largely a formality and will make history as the first time Brussels 
has vetoed a proposed merger twice.
Competition investigators found that the merger would leave the combined company dominating about 85 per cent 
of seats on short-haul flights in and out of Ireland - a share that fell to just under 70 per cent under Ryanair's 
proposed competition remedies.
Ryanair insisted it had met antitrust concerns raised by the commission, and has "instructed its lawyers to appeal 
any prohibition decision to the European courts".
Mr O'Leary failed in overturning the commission's 2007 decision to block his takeover bid for Aer Lingus; a second 
offer was withdrawn in 2009 after the Irish government opposed it. With Dublin also opposing the latest bid, Robin 
Kiely, a Ryanair spokesman, said: "This decision [by Brussels] is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested 
interests of the Irish government and is not based on competition law."
The commission declined to comment.
Brussels quashes Ryanair takeover ambitions for second time
Mr O'Leary put forward a "revolutionary" package of competition remedies - involving the de facto break-up of Aer 
Lingus - in an attempt to assuage Brussels' deep-set antitrust objections. While the concessions went well beyond 
anything offered in the past to win EU clearance for an airline merger, the commission still concluded the tie-up 
raised serious competition problems.
One central concern with Ryanair's remedies was the viability of its offer to hand Flybe, the lossmaking UK regional 
airline, the right to operate about 40 per cent of Aer Lingus's short-haul routes out of Ireland.
Even though Ryanair proposed giving Flybe's Irish business at least nine aircraft and EUR100m in cash, rivals 
questioned whether it would have the financial clout or assets to compete effectively with the low-cost carrier in its 
home market.
The Irish government was concerned about a second Ryanair remedy proposal that might have led to most of Aer 
Lingus' valuable take-off and landing slots at London's Heathrow airport being handed to British Airways.
Aer Lingus' shares closed down 4.3 per cent at EUR1.28. Flybe shares were down 11.8 per cent at 50.25p. Ryanair 
shares were up 0.8 per cent at EUR5.71.
Mr O'Leary's floundering pursuit of Aer Lingus is the one notable blemish on his record at Ryanair - although the 
attempted merger is consistent with his relentless search for profits.
Neil Glynn, analyst at Credit Suisse, estimated that merging Ryanair and Aer Lingus could generate synergies that 
would boost the combined company's net income by EUR50m per year - representing almost 10 per cent of the 
low-cost carrier's estimated profit after tax in the year to March 2013.
Mr O'Leary thought he had a better chance of securing the commission's clearance after Brussels last year 
approved British Airways' merger with BMI British Midland - which combined the two largest airlines at Heathrow.
But BMI was running up losses, and facing possible closure, whereas Aer Lingus is a profitable airline that rejected 
Ryanair's bid.
Moreover, Aer Lingus accused Ryanair of launching the bid to halt a UK regulatory investigation into its near 30 per 
cent stake in the Irish flag carrier.
The bid was made just days after the Competition Commission was handed the task of probing whether Ryanair's 
stake served to weaken Aer Lingus as a competitor.
The regulator has powers to potentially force Ryanair to sell its stake - although the company's willingness to litigate 
means it could take several years to reach this point.
Aer Lingus has already been a painful financial experience for Ryanair. It spent EUR407m to become Aer Lingus' 
largest shareholder, but has written down the value of that stake to EUR80m.
Still, Ryanair is one of the most profitable airlines in the world - and pays dividends, unlike many of its rivals.
Edward Stanford, analyst at Oriel Securities, said: "The pursuit of Aer Lingus is Mr O'Leary's Achilles' heel, his 
weakness, his blind spot, but shareholders are happy to indulge him because it has not broadly distracted from the 
main effort of creating value for shareholders."

RYANAIR'S latest attempt to take over Irish rival Aer Lingus has been scuppered by the European Commission.
The budget airline said it will appeal after the Commission indicated during a "state of play" meeting that it will 
prohibit the (EURO)694m (£597m) takeover.
Ryanair had argued that its offer to give 43 short-haul routes and (EURO)100m to regional carrier Flybe as part of 
the takeover would ease competition concerns. Shares in Aer Lingus fell 4.3 per cent.

An agreement between Ryanair and the UK's Flybe designed to allay the fears of European authorities concerned 
about competition should Ryanair successfully take over Aer Lingus doesn't go far enough, according to Transport 
minister Leo Varadkar today.
He said the Ryanair-Flybe proposal does not do enough to satisfy the Government that air passengers will be 
protected in terms of competition and connectivity.
On the revised Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus, Leo Varadkar said what is being put together with Flybe is only for three 
years.
He said the fact that Ryanair has to give Flybe ''a gift'' of E100m to make it a competitor raises questions. The 
Minister said the Government does not support the Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus because it thinks it would affect 
connectivity negatively. This is because IAG will be given the Heathrow slots. Regarding the Government's stake in 
Aer Lingus, he said the Government has decided that it will dispose of the Aer Lingus stake at the right time, the 
right price and in the right conditions. Jim French, chief executive of British airline, Flybe, is in Dublin to sell the deal 
announced last week with Ryanair to create a new carrier as part of a deal with Ryanair to satisfy regulatory 
concerns over Ryanair's last-ditch bid for Aer Lingus. He has pledged to develop more flights between Ireland and 
the UK if the European Commission gives the go-ahead. Under the deal with Ryanair, the new carrier, Flybe 
Ireland, would receive E100 million and nine aircraft from Ryanair and commit to operating 43 routes for at least 
three years if Ryanair's Aer Lingus bid succeeds, he said. Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost carrier, is making its 
third attempt to take over rival Aer Lingus and has been told by the European Commission it has one last chance to 
submit measures to prove the merger will not curb competition. Ryanair will also provide Flybe Ireland with forward 
sales cash and liabilities worth around E50 million. In return Flybe will pay Ryanair E1 million for the newly created

Body
Aer Lingus today said that there was never any realistic chance that Ryanair would have received permission from 
the EU to take over Aer Lingus.
It said it noted that Ryanair had said it has been told by the EU that its bid for Aer Lingus has been rejected but that 
the EU has not been in touch with it on any decision reached.
"As indicated in our statement of 20 June 2012 at the outset of the bid, there was significant uncertainty that the 
offer from Ryanair was ever capable of completion. Ryanair's first attempt to take over Aer Lingus was prohibited in 
2007 on competition grounds. Aer Lingus is a much stronger airline today than it was at the time of the previous 
Ryanair offers and is Ryanair's only significant competitor on the vast majority of Irish air routes. The number of 
routes into and out of Ireland on which Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete has sharply increased since 2007," the Aer 
Lingus statement said.
"The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger in this instance than with the previous offers. Therefore, it 
was and remains Aer Lingus' position that the offer should never have been made." "As indicated on 6 February 
2013, in our preliminary results announcement, Aer Lingus delivered an excellent overall performance in 2012. 
During 2012, the Company increased operating profit, total revenue, passenger numbers, average yields, load 
factors and market share. Aer Lingus is well positioned for future growth and continues to implement its successful 
'value carrier' business model. We look forward to continuing to serve our customers and to providing choice for 
consumers in the markets we serve." Following Ryanair's announcement regarding the EC investigation, Aer Lingus 
said it looks forward to continuing to assist the UK Competition Commission (UKCC) in its ongoing investigation into 
the anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding. On 15 June 2012, the Office of Fair Trading referred 
Ryanair's minority shareholding to the UKCC for review, concluding that "there is a realistic prospect that its stake 
has resulted or will result in a substantial lessening of competition." "Ryanair has on a number of occasions 
A Lingus: Ryanair had little hope anyway A Lingus On Bid
attempted to halt this separate UKCC investigation, including by means of its third hostile takeover offer. Aer Lingus 
now looks forward to the conclusion of the UKCC investigation. As indicated previously it is Aer Lingus' position that 
Ryanair, as our largest competitor should be required to divest its shareholding in Aer Lingus," Aer Lingus said.

2007 on competition grounds. Aer Lingus is a much stronger airline today than it was at the time of the previous 
Ryanair offers and is Ryanair's only significant competitor on the vast majority of Irish air routes. The number of 
routes into and out of Ireland on which Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete has sharply increased since 2007," the Aer 
Lingus statement said.
"The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger in this instance than with the previous offers. Therefore, it 
was and remains Aer Lingus' position that the offer should never have been made." "As indicated on 6 February 
2013, in our preliminary results announcement, Aer Lingus delivered an excellent overall performance in 2012. 
During 2012, the Company increased operating profit, total revenue, passenger numbers, average yields, load 
factors and market share. Aer Lingus is well positioned for future growth and continues to implement its successful 
'value carrier' business model. We look forward to continuing to serve our customers and to providing choice for 
consumers in the markets we serve." Following Ryanair's announcement regarding the EC investigation, Aer Lingus 
said it looks forward to continuing to assist the UK Competition Commission (UKCC) in its ongoing investigation into 
the anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding. On 15 June 2012, the Office of Fair Trading referred 
Ryanair's minority shareholding to the UKCC for review, concluding that "there is a realistic prospect that its stake 
has resulted or will result in a substantial lessening of competition." "Ryanair has on a number of occasions

attempted to halt this separate UKCC investigation, including by means of its third hostile takeover offer. Aer Lingus 
now looks forward to the conclusion of the UKCC investigation. As indicated previously it is Aer Lingus' position that 
Ryanair, as our largest competitor should be required to divest its shareholding in Aer Lingus," Aer Lingus said.
