Highlight: Gol
Body
If you pick 100 Brazilians at random, it is likely that only three of them will have flown before, and if you are flying on 
a Gol 737, it is likely that more than ten of your fellow passengers are flying for the first time. When you consider 
that the majority of Brazil's 180 million population sees air travel as beyond their budget, starting a low-cost airline 
seems like a straightforward idea.
Well, it has worked for Gol. Since its launch in 2001 it has been profitable. Basing itself on success fill low-cost 
models such as Southwest and Ryanair, Gol's strategy has been to have a low-cost business model with some of 
the lowest costs in the market.
It has 'also been helped by the poor state of its competitors. TAM and Varig have had well-publicized problems and 
Vasp's management admits that it is uncertain about the future.
"The consensus in Brazil is that Vasp is unlikely to survive into 2005. If tree, Gol should benefit. Longer term, how 
Varig restructures is far more likely to impact on Gol's future growth opportunities," said a Morgan Stanley research 
report in November.
Competitors' problems have allowed Gol to quickly gain a 24% share of the Brazilian airline market, but it wants 
more and aims to have a fleet of 70 aircraft by 2010.
However, Gol's growth is not just based on increasing its market share, but also by using the low-cost model to 
attract the 170 million-plus Brazilians that have never flown. Unlike most low-costs, about 70% of its passengers are 
business travellers.
"The key is to grow the market for air travel," says Richard Lark, CFO of Gol. "With our low fares we aim to attract 
customers to travelling by air."
Gol scores in Brazil: having started only three years ago, Brazil's first low-cost carrier has become one of the 
most profitable airlines in the world. Alexandr....
Lark estimates that just six million Brazilians have flown before. Some 10% of Gol's passengers have never flown, 
and he expects this to increase as the general population becomes more aware of low-cost airlines.
Gol is also competing with land travel and some of the fares on night flights are priced to compete with long-
distance bus tickets.
In addition to the domestic market, which has been its priority, Gol is starting to target international routes. Its first 
international flight, Sao Paulo to Bueno Aires, is due to start in December. "Part of our focus is adding routes with 
other Latin American capitals," says Lark.
Cost control
"Operationally we have the lowest costs in the market, and among the lowest in the world, per seat kilometre," says 
Lark. In the third-quarter 2004, Gol's operating cost per seat kilometre was R$0.15.
Gol achieves this by working its aircraft hard. "We have a high level of aircraft utilitization--about 14 hours a day," 
says Lark.
The airline also saves costs by selling fares through the internet--more than 70% of its fares are sold online. In 
September 2004 Merrill Lynch said that the airline's margin was one of the best among all the airlines it covers.
Gol is also focusing on yield management. "We have a very good yield management area," he says. "Every seat 
has pricing on demand." The carrier has past on most of the increasing fuel costs to passengers.
In 2001 the airline's net revenues were R$230 million ($97 million), in 2002 R$678million and in 2003 
R$1400million. In 2003 it made a net profit of R$175.5 million, with a 24% operating margin. Gol only gives 
guidance for operating margin for 2004 and 2005 and is hoping to get between 28% and 30% in 2004, and about 
28% in 2005.
Price control
Gol's market is regulated by the Departmento de Aviaco Civil (DAC), which has set a domestic load threshold of 
65%. The DAC will stop new routes being added if domestic flights tall below this.
"Expansion in Brazil is closely monitored," says Lark. "It has produced good supply and demand for us."
The load factor averaged about 65% in 2004, which is a positive for Gol because it means the airline can continue 
to add routes. This load factor, as well as Brazilian airline capacity, is expected to grow faster in 2005.
Close regulation, which on the surface could seem to be potentially limiting to Gol's growth, does help both legacy 
and low-cost carriers and avoids price wars. By controlling route growth the government can protect legacy carriers, 
without providing the direct subsidies that create problems for low-cost airlines in other parts of the world. It is also 
unlikely that a new low-cost airline will be 'allowed into Brazil soon, another plus for Gol.
"We see little risk that a new, low-cost entrant will start up and pose a threat to Gol. The reason is that there are 
very few remaining slots at the country's most important airports, even if Vasp exits the business," said November's 
Morgan Stanley report.
As long as the load factor and domestic travel market keeps rising, Gol should not have too many problems in 
increasing its operations. "With the domestic load factor now exceeding 65%, we expect DAC to be more liberal 
and flexible about supply additions in the future," said Morgan Stanley. "DAC's evolving approach to capacity 
growth suggests that Gol's capacity could grow faster than most analysts expect."
Gol scores in Brazil: having started only three years ago, Brazil's first low-cost carrier has become one of the 
most profitable airlines in the world. Alexandr....
The DAC also announced in 2004 that it would stop ticket discounting unless the airlines could prove their financial 
health. At the time Gol said it would apply for authorization, and Lark says that theDAC now rates it as good--and 
that it is the only airline in Brazil that achieves this.
Financing the new fleet
Gol's fleet consists of 27 737 aircraft, all of which are leased. However, it ordered 17 new 737-800s in May, worth 
$2.7 billion. Gol also has options on another 43.
Gol has made a strategic decision to have an all-Boeing fleet and is likely to use US Ex-Im support to finance the 
aircraft.
The airline will start receiving its new 737s in 2006, and will take delivery of a further four or five a year until 2010. It 
plans to finance 85% of these US Ex-Im Bank guaranteed loans.
"We have a big market for debt because of the large Ex-Im guarantee and are very comfortable about the 
financing," says Lark. "Capital costs are very expensive in Brazil. But on the financing side, we can keep our costs 
low."
He adds: "The Ex-Im loan means we will have lower debt borrowing costs than US airlines and a capital cost equal 
or lower than the best US airlines."
In terms of other types of financing, Lark says the carrier may consider a few sale/leasebacks. It is unlikely that Gol 
will use the debt capital markets for financing. "Brazilian companies find the debt capital markets more difficult," 
says Lark.
On the equity side, though, there is definitely potential. In 2003, US insurance company AIG, which also owns ILFC, 
invested a 20% stake in the airline.
In June 2004 the airline floated on the New York Stock Exchange and on the Brazilian Mercado Exchange, raising 
$280 million. Some $150 million of this was used to repay AIG capital shareholders. It priced at eight times Ebitda 
and 13 times earnings.
The IPO was about six times oversubscribed. About 72% was sold into the US, the rest locally. "We went to the US, 
where investors are used to low-cost airlines, and there is a big investor and analyst base for this type of stock," 
says Lark. "We have a following in Brazil but the local market still has a way to go."
Lark says it is possible that it could go back to the equity markets in 2005 or 2006, with AIG expected to sell its 
remaining 5% stake.
He is confident about the future. "We are combining our overall market knowledge with our understanding of Brazil," 
says Lark. "It has worked well for Gol so far."
If he is successful maybe one day every Brazilian will have flown.(c) Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC This

The Dublin market surged ahead after yesterday's losses, with AIB and Ryanair topping the leader board.
At the closing bell, the ISEQ index of leading Irish shares was up 47.32 points to 6,021.18.
Buyers returned to selected heavyweight stocks today, with AIB and Ryanair being singled out for particular 
attention among investors. Profit taking on several stocks, however, limited the extent of the day's gains.
 AIB shares surged ahead by 25c to 1487 with 1.34 million shares traded on the day. The stock benefited from 
media speculation that M&T Bank in the US, in which AIB has a significant stake, may become a bid target for New 
York-based, Independence Bank. Bank of Ireland headed in the opposite direction and dropped 5c to 1143 with 2.1 
million shares changing hands. Profit taking dominated the second level with Anglo Irish down 14c to 1691 and Irish 
Life & Permanent managed to edge up 2c to 1302. Construction sector leader, CRH, saw its shares rise 10c to 
1910 after earlier profit taking as the latest economic data from the US showed falling oil prices and increasing 
spending on construction. The US is a key market for the Irish firm.

European regional governments are being urged to lobby the European Commission over new guidelines governing 
the use of public funds to attract low-fare carriers to airports, due to be published before the end of the year.
Following February's decision-that the Walloon state government illegally used public funds to attract Irish budget 
carrier Ryanair to its publicly owned Brussels South Charleroi airport, the EC promised to publish a series of 
guidelines, laying out how state aid can be used to bring air traffic to the regions.
Speaking at the Airports Regions Conference last week in Brussels, Roy Griffins, director general of the European 
division of Airports Council International, called on the EC to deliver its interpretation of state-aid rules as they apply 
to low-fares airlines as soon as possible and include guidelines covering "exclusivity, duration and transparency" of 
all deals.
"The important thing is to dissolve the legal uncertainty so regions know what incentives they can provide to 
continue to attract no-frills airlines," says Griffin.
However, EC insiders who have seen the draft document say it mirrors the Charleroi ruling, prescribes a maximum 
of five years for any incentive deal and limits state aid to new routes and up to a maximum of 50% of all proven 
costs. Ryanair say this puts state-owned airports at a disadvantage compared with private airports.
Jim Callaghan, head of governmental affairs for Ryanair, says regions "should not accept this crap from the EC" 
and has urged them to lobby the Brussels-based executive on their behalf. Callaghan claims the EC has refused to 
involve representatives from the low-fares carriers in discussions over the new rules.

"The Commission was using Charleroi in order to regulate and it will come out with these guidelines that it will then 
enforce," he says.
Bernard Garandeau, secretary general of Ville et Aéroports, which represents French publicly owned airport 
operators, says its members are worried about the effect of the new guidelines, especially if they force regions to 
prove the economic necessity of the air link. "If you look at airports like Bergerac or Paris Beauvais, where there are 
other carriers operating on routes from nearby airports, then as we foresee the new rules, any assistance would be 
illegal," he says.

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair is expecting to be sued in a test case by the UK government for non-payment of 
passenger compensation. The carrier is appealing against the legality of any such action.
The controversial pan-European law granting compensation and assistance to offloaded, delayed or stranded 
passengers is to come into force in February, despite the victory by several airline associations in July in 
challenging its legality.
The UK High Court referred the case to the European Court of Justice and urged an expedited hearing before the 
ruling entered force (Flight International, 20-26 July). It is understood that the earliest the court will now hear the 
case is August.
Ryanair expects to receive its first application for compensation from a disgruntled passenger before that date, 
which it would refuse to pay if the delay or flight cancellation was due to factors outside the airline's control, such as 
weather or air traffic control. Under UK law, such refusal to pay would be a criminal act and the UK government 
could take the airline to court. A senior Ryanair source says: "We would welcome this opportunity to prove the 
unfeasibility of the law."Copyright 2004 Reed Business Information Limited188

Ryanair has picked Shannon Airport as its latest European base in a major USD240m investment that will generate 
2,000 new jobs.
Shannon Airport will become the low-fares airline's 12th major European base with up to four Boeing 737-800 
aircraft from May 2005.
Ryanair will operate a network of 14 routes to the UK and continental Europe and has guaranteed to deliver 1.3 
million passengers in the first year, rising to two million passengers by 2010.
 The firm says that flying 2 million passengers into Shannon every year will eventually generate 2,000 new jobs in 
the Shannon region, with the first 200 of these being direct Ryanair employees. The routes announced by Ryanair 
from Shannon include six UK destinations as well as eight European destinations.

The Government has been urged to exploit the boost to Irish tourism generated by Ryanair's new Shannon base.
The Irish Hotels Federation welcomed the timing of Ryanair's planned E180m investment in Shannon Airport, 
particularly as the Shannon and Mid West regions have seen a 15pc drop in holiday visitors over the past five 
years.
But it also urged the Government to renegotiate the US Ireland air bilateral agreement and to give an immediate go 
ahead to the development of a competing second terminal at Dublin Airport, so that a similar range of new routes 
can be developed for the capital.
 Fine Gael's deputy enterprise spokesman Pat Breen said the development is a significant boost to plans to develop 
a transatlantic hub at Shannon. He urged the Shannon Airport Authority to sit down with Aer Lingus and other 
American carriers to expand and develop their routes through Shannon by providing similar incentives to those 
offered to Ryanair.

Ryanair has agreed a new cut-price deal at Shannon Airport, according to a report this morning.
The low-cost airline will pay a landing charge of just 50 cent per passenger on new routes opened from the airport, 
the Irish Times reports.
It has also negotiated a fee of one euro per passenger, rising to under two euro, for extra volume on existing routes, 
the paper says.
 This is a substantial discount to the 7.50 euro average landing charge at Shannon. A spokesman for the Shannon 
Airport Authority has declined to comment on the matter. Ryanair has recently announced the addition of a new 
route from Shannon to Liverpool. It already flies from the airport to Frankfurt Hahn, Glasgow Prestwick, Beauvais 
and Charleroi. The paper says that Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has told the airport's board that the 
airline will almost double the number of passengers using the regional airport by adding 10 new routes to the UK 
and Europe. Rival low cost carrier EasyJet is to begin flying from Stansted to Shannon in January with four flights a 
day. Shannon chairman Patrick Shanahan has already said the airport intends to switch to a new low charge 
business model to attract new airlines.

Two Spanish companies have made a recommended cash takeover offer for TBI, the UK airports operator, valuing 
the group, which includes London Luton airport, at Pounds 551m.
The bid, unanimously recommended by the TBI board, has been made by Abertis Infraestructuras, the leading 
Spanish infrastructure and toll-road operator, and Aena, the Spanish state-owned airports group. They have formed 
a joint venture, Airport Concessions and Development, which will be 90 per cent owned and controlled by Abertis 
and 10 per cent owned by Aena.
The bidders are offering 92 1/2pa share, with a loan note alternative, representing a 21.7 per cent premium to TBI's 
76p share price on November 17 - the day before the offer period started.
The TBI share price closed 2p higher yesterday at 91 1/4p. It rose sharply last week, when TBI said it had received 
an unidentified preliminary takeover approach.
Keith Brooks, TBI chief executive, said the cash offer was "a full and fair value" and "highly attractive" for 
shareholders.
TBI controls Luton, Belfast International and Cardiff airports in the UK, Stockholm Skavsta in Sweden and Orlando 
Sanford in the US. It is keen to dispose of its airport interests in Bolivia.
After restructuring its airport holdings, it has started to grow by attracting traffic from fast-growing low-cost carriers 
led by EasyJet, Ryanair and BMIbaby.
The pace of airport deals in Europe is accelerating, helped by improving passenger volumes. The bid for TBI comes 
soon after Macquarie Airports, the Australian listed international airport fund, won a controlling stake in Brussels 
Zaventem airport in a Euros 735m (Pounds 514m) deal.
Directors and shareholders representing 29.16 per cent of TBI's shares have entered into legally binding 
agreements to accept the offer, while shareholders representing 10.23 per cent of the shares have confirmed their 
intention to accept the offer.
Spanish groups in joint bid for Luton airport owner TBI
The dominant shareholdings in TBI are held by members of the Thomas family, with a total of 19.48 per cent. 
Stanley Thomas, non-executive chairman, holds 9.4 per cent. A 5 per cent stake is held by Dermot Desmond, the 
Irish financier who controls London City airport.
Abertis is aiming to expand by adding airports to its existing operations, which include motorway tolls, broadcasting, 
car parks, logistics and warehousing.
The Spanish groups were advised by HSBC, while TBI was advised by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. Airport

Do the Spanish know they are paying up for an airport in Britain's worst town? Luton recently topped the list in a 
new book, Crap Towns II - The Nation Decides. Undeterred, Abertis, the Spanish infrastructure group, with minority 
support from Aena, the state-owned Spanish airport operator, has bid Pounds 551m for TBI, whose main asset is 
Luton airport.
Recently, TBI has been moving in the right direction. Interim profits increased. It is acquiring the outstanding 
minority stake in Luton and has unveiled plans for further investment there. It has disposed of its airport services 
business, with other non-core assets also earmarked for disposal. So why sell now?
The answer lies in the price. The Abertis bid reflects a multiple of enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation of 15.3 times based on the year to March 2004. This would be a generous valuation 
for a single airport - Brussels Zaventum was sold this month for less - and TBI has achieved it for a mixed bag of 
assets. The Spanish group was not the obvious buyer for TBI, but the full price may deter counter offers. For 
Abertis, mainly a toll-road operator, the deal is a strategic diversification. TBI's business is focused on the low-cost 
airline sector, where opportunities for traffic growth are high. With EasyJet and Ryanair as customers, Luton has 
exposure to two of the strongest discount carriers. Luton might not be a great place to live, but its airport is an 
attractive asset.

Irish low-cost carrier, Ryanair, may face a dispute with German authorities over its decision to close its Stansted to 
Erfurt route.
Thuringia state's Ministry of Transportation pointed out today that Ryanair's closure of the route violates the six 
month notice period included in the contract it had with the airline.
An exception is possible if there are "important reasons" for cancelling the contract, the Ministry said. A Ryanair 
spokeswoman said the airline cannot be forced to "service a route that is loss-making," but added the company is 
open to talks.
 Ryanair announced yesterday it plans to close its "under performing" route from Stansted to Erfurt on Jan 19 and 
its Barcelona to Turin route on March 1.

Ryanair has offered free tickets to customers of a bankrupt Italian airline. 
It says that thousands of intending passengers with Volare, which has ceased operations, can use a special code to 
get free flights.
The offer is available where Ryanair operates equivalent routes. 
 A Ryanair spokesman said: "We're doing something good for consumers who lost out through this collapse." 
Ryanair's deputy chief executive Michael Cawley announced the offer in Milan. Volare, which was Italy's third 
largest carrier, had its aviation licence revoked last week. It is now being investigated for possible false accounting. 
Many of its 1,200 staff are owed months of back pay.

Aviation history is littered with failures and the list of casualties continues to grow. The latest grounded airline is 
Volare, a small Italian operation competing in the cut-throat market for cheap European flights. 
Volare was small - it had 21 aircraft - but its demise tells part of a bigger story.
Capacity in Europe's deregulated aviation market has ballooned, from seven low-cost carriers three years ago to 
nearly 50. It is clear that the big budget airlines - Ryanair, EasyJet and the privately owned Air Berlin - are gaining 
on upstarts and charter carriers. EasyJet yesterday echoed the slightly more confident mood expressed by Ryanair. 
Load factors and total revenues per passenger between October and December are expected to be the same as 
last year. Air Berlin is also pumping out optimism, predicting a profit for 2004.
Consolidation in Europe is inevitable. High fuel costs sharpen the pain of falling fares. But limping airlines hoping 
that stronger rivals will buy them are likely to be disappointed. A focus on costs can easily be clouded by the 
difficulties of integrating a competitor. Bankruptcies are most likely. Then, once an airline closes for business, 
survivors will fill the gaps. Ryanair is already making plans to snatch Volare customers. EasyJet is right in saying 
that its business model is proving resilient. Only by keeping its strategy focused and simple - as US low-cost 
pioneers have done - will it ensure this remains the case.

EasyJet, the leading UK low-cost airline, said short-haul airfares in Europe had not yet declined as feared at the 
start of the winter season.
The airline, which reported a 21 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 62.2m (Pounds 51.5m) for the year to 
September 30, said it expected total revenues per passenger in the three months to the end of December to be 
"broadly the same as last year".
Its shares closed up 2 1/4p at 185 1/2p. The price has risen by about 45 per cent in the last four weeks since 
Icelandair emerged as a surprise investor.
In September EasyJet hit an all-time low of 118 1/4p in the wake of two profit warnings in the early summer.
The airline remains cautious about prospects for next year.
Ray Webster, chief executive, said: "We continue to have low visibility in regard to future fares . . . We expect the 
remaining months of winter to be challenging and that competition will be intense."
In recent weeks Ryanair, the rival Irish low-cost carrier, has also forecast that competition and the decline in fares in 
the current winter season could be somewhat less fierce than it warned previously.
Chris Avery, aviation analyst at JP Morgan, said EasyJet's yield outlook was "nothing like as bleak as the market 
thought".
He forecast flat profits this year because of excess capacity in the industry and high fuel prices.
EasyJet said that underlying annual profits - pre exceptionals and goodwill - had fallen by 11.3 per cent from 
Pounds 96.3m to Pounds 85.4m.
Yields, or average fares, declined by 2.3 per cent from Pounds 43.28 to Pounds 42.28 in the face of increasing 
levels of overall competition.
EasyJet stays on cautious course
The airline has already announced that it is slowing planned capacity growth in coming years.
Mr Webster said yesterday that capacity, measured by available seat kilometres, would rise by about 25 per cent in 
the current year, instead of the 31 per cent previously planned.
Capacity grew by 21 per cent in the year under review.
EasyJet said it was deferring the delivery of three Airbus A319 aircraft in its 2008 financial year at no penalty cost.
Passenger volumes rose 20 per cent to 24.3m in 2003-04, while turnover increased 17 per cent from Pounds 932m 
to Pounds 1.09bn. Earnings per share were up 25 per cent at 10.3p.

Body
Ryanair, the leading European low-cost airline, will today announce plans to expand in the Italian market to take 
advantage of the collapse of Volare, the Italian low-fare scheduled and charter operator.
EasyJet, the key rival to Ryanair, is also sensing blood and is hopeful of being able to pick up Volare take-off and 
landing slots at Paris Orly airport.
The sharks are circling amid signs that the long forecast shake-out in the short-haul airline sector in Europe has 
started.
Volare's collapse follows only weeks after V-Bird, a Dutch-owned carrier operating out of Dusseldorf-Niederrhein 
airport in Germany, also ceased operations.
Ray Webster, chief executive of EasyJet, said yesterday that there were now at least 47 low-cost airlines in Europe 
compared with only seven three years ago.
"This is clearly not sustainable in the longer term and we expect consolidations and liquidations - indeed these have 
started to appear in recent months."
However, the picture is complicated because, even as some carriers go out of business, others are still determined 
to enter the sector.
In Italy, a successor to Volare - myair.com - is seeking to launch next month with three Airbus A320s, rising to four 
in January and six by April. It is being started by several former Volare managers.
Ryanair, which has a sizeable operation in Italy with two bases, one at Rome-Ciampino and one at Milan-Bergamo, 
will be seeking to crush such aspirations.
Sharks smell a short-haul shake-up: The larger European low-cost airlines are awaiting a bloodbath, write 
Kevin Done and Adrian Michaels
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said recently that high oil prices and competition would force the pace of 
the shake-out.
"Many of our competitor airlines who were losing money heroically when fuel was Dollars 25 a barrel are doomed 
the longer it stays at Dollars 50. Our prediction of a bloodbath and airline casualties this winter may be accelerated 
by record high oil prices as well as by irrational competition.
"We anticipate that there will be further airline casualties as the 'perfect storm' of declining fares and record high oil 
prices force loss-making carriers out of the industry."
Volare declared itself insolvent in the early hours of yesterday morning after a board meeting gave up hope of 
finding more money for a recapitalisation plan.
The company, which is privately owned, says it is missing in the short term Euros 60m (Dollars 78m) but people 
with knowledge of its finances say at least double that amount is realistically needed.
In the meantime, the Italian government has said it is looking at solutions for saving the company.
It seems likely that a special administrator will be appointed to co-ordinate any plans with the bankruptcy court. This 
would be an attempted rescue involving an amendment to a new law enacted for the collapse of dairy company 
Parmalat.
Enrico Bondi, Parmalat's administrator, at least has a viable business on which to base his efforts. People who 
have analysed Volare's situation doubted it could easily be saved.
Its fleet of about 25 aircraft is leased and now out of the company's hands. It also has no insurance to fly. The 
withdrawal of insurance and supplier deliveries last week caused the company to suspend all flights last Friday.
If rivals start to take over its slots at certain airports, Volare's hopes of a relaunch will diminish further.
Even worse, the Italian financial police have raided the company's offices and are conducting an investigation into 
allegations of false accounting. KPMG completed a forensic audit recently and raised questions about the 
company's accounts.
Deloitte audited the company's books in 2002 and 2003. "In both cases," it said yesterday, "the audit showed that 
Volare was in financial difficulty and that the company's continuation, and hence the recovery in its asset values, 
depended on finding new financial means to implement the board's strategy," Deloitte said.
While rivals in the low-cost airline business have boomed, Volare's problems, regardless of allegations of bad 
accounting, stem from crucial management mis-steps and bad timing.
Volare was combined with charter company Air Europe in 2000, increasing its overall debt just as the airline 
industry was about to be plunged into global recession, the events of September 11 2001 and later the Sars 
epidemic.

Body
Irish low-cost carrier, Ryanair, today said it would expand its operations in Italy after the demise of Italian airline 
Volare.
Ryanair announced a new twice daily service from Paris (Beauvais) to Venice (Treviso) which is Ryanair's 65th 
international route to and from Italy and means that Ryanair now flies on nine of the eleven international routes 
previously flown by Volare from Italy to other EU destinations. 
Ryanair is operating most of these routes with greater frequency and lower fares than those sold by Volare.
Ryanair will take over the failed airline's routes from Italy that will include services from Rome, Milan and Venice to 
France, Spain and within Italy.
 The Irish carrier has offered to fly stranded Volare passengers to their booked destination free of charge. The 
airline has also invited all of the Italian airports affected by the collapse of Volare to meetings in Milan on 
Wednesday and Thursday of this week to discuss the possibility of Ryanair offering low fare domestic flights within 
Italy on those routes that were previously operated by Volare.

The boss of airports operator TBI defended the price being offered for the company and said he had no idea 
whether it would trigger a counter-bid.
Chief executive Keith Brooks and his board are backing a 92.5p a share cash offer worth £551 million by European 
infrastructure group Albertis, which runs a network of toll roads throughout Europe.
TBI (TBI) shares are 1.75p higher at 91p having crept up 4.5p yesterday on bid rumours.
TBI, which owns Luton, Belfast and Cardiff airports, has been the subject of frenzied takeover speculation over the 
years. Shareholders speaking for 39% have thrown their weight behind the bid.
Brooks told a conference call that the board was backing a good offer. Asked to comment on reports that analysts 
had said TBI was worth 100p plus he said I have never seen analysts say 100p plus but I have seen press 
speculation and I have asked journalists where they got that figure from.
Brooks, who plans to stay on after the bid, said the price represented 15.3 times ebitda ( earnings before interest 
tax, depreciation and amortisation) against 12.3 times recently paid for Brussels airport.
Miguel Abeniacar, representing Albertis, defended the companys expertise in airport management even though it 
appears to be limited to operating two runways in Bogota, Colombia.
He said its partner, Spanish based Aena, which owns 10% of the vehicle put together to mount the offer, is one of 
the worlds largest airport operators. We are very confident we can manage airports, he said.
There is unlikely to be any government opposition to a British airport falling into foreign hands. However, the 
change of ownership is likely to be viewed with concern by budget airlines such as Ryanair and Easyjet, which 
operate out of Luton, particularly if there are any moves to renegotiate landing rights.
Last year TBI handled 18 million passengers. In the first half to September there was a 12% increase compared 
with a year ago.

Liverpool's claim to be the UK's fastest-growing regional airport was given a big boost yesterday when Ryanair, 
Europe's biggest low-cost airline, announced a Dollars 240m (Pounds 143m) investment plan for the city's John 
Lennon airport.
Ryanair's decision to make Liverpool its 12th European base and expand the number of routes it offers from four to 
13 is likely to add an extra 1m passengers a year to an airport currently handling about 3.4m.
Ryanair will base up to four 189-seat Boeing 737-80 aircraft at Liverpool.
Liverpool has long been overshadowed by the much bigger Manchester airport, which handles 21m passengers a 
year. But over the past five years Liverpool has moved much more quickly than its bigger rival to attract low-cost 
operators.
Over that time it has ranked as the country's fastest-growing airport, due in large part to the rapid growth of 
EasyJet, another low-cost operator, which accounts for two-thirds of Liverpool's traffic.
However, the expansion of Ryanair means that by early next year Europe's three largest airlines will all have bases 
at Liverpool and operate a total of 38 low-cost routes.
The rapid growth of the privately-owned John Lennon airport is one the most visible symbols of the economic 
renaissance of the Merseyside region.
Liverpool is enjoying rapid growth in tourism in the run-up to being European Capital of Culture in 2008 and 
industrial investment is starting to flow back into a region that only 20 years ago was written off by many private 
sector investors because of its strike-prone workforce.
Mark Basnett, director of investment at the Mersey Partnership, said job creation and business growth were running 
at record levels and the Ryanair expansion was "further proof that we are on the way to establishing Liverpool as 
one of Europe's major cities".
Liverpool gets new lift from Ryanair
However, Ryanair's expansion into an airport dominated by arch-rival EasyJet will intensify their bitter competition.
Michael O'Leary, Ryan-air's outspoken chief executive, said yesterday that over the next 12 months Ryanair would 
carry 1.4m passengers to and from Liverpool.
He said this would save consumers "over Pounds 30m on the high fares charged by EasyJet". Ryanair would offer 
fares that would be "almost half the price of EasyJet's".
He added: "Our message to EasyJet is simple. You can't match Ryanair's low fares."

Easyjet is operationally stronger than ever before with £510 million of balance sheet cash, but the airline used too 
many C-words for comfort today.
In spite of the cash and the fact that preliminary figures are in line with reduced expectations, the statement 
accompanying the figures is peppered with too many C-words for our liking: creditable, competition and challenge.
There is also a lack of certainty over the Icelandic Air stake, fuel prices and falling revenues per passenger.
Anyone about to buy shares in a low-cost airline there are now 47 of them against seven three years ago - could do 
worse than take Panmure Gordons advice: buy Ryanair instead.
Profit before tax in the year to 30 September rose 21% to £62.2 million on 17% higher turnover of £1.09 billion 
against £932 million last time. Earnings per share rose 25% to 10.3p.
Easyjet carried 24.3 million passengers, the increase of 20% improving its load factor from 84.1% to 84.5%, on 92 
aircraft working 153 routes from 44 airports.
These are creditable results in challenging market conditions which have affected all airlines says chief executive 
Ray Webster.
They have strengthened our position in the European airline market. Both financially and operationally we are 
stronger than we have ever been and, despite the high fuel price and degree of competition, we are well placed for 
the coming year.
Chairman Sir Colin Chandler says: Returns will be adversely affected if there is not some abatement of the price of 
oil.
There are no further details beyond the fact that surcharges will be avoided, fuel charges account for 14% of total 
costs and the company is 30% hedged until the end of June 2005.
Lower fares brought about by increased competition meant that revenue per passenger fell 2% to £44.82p.
With all but £62 million of Easyjet's revenue coming from ticket sales, Ryanair is further ahead on raising passenger 
revenue with its in-flight entertainment system being the latest initiative.
A less than comfortable ride at Easyjet
Easyjet is working hard to get costs down, but again Ryanair seems better. In the coming year Easyjet is getting rid 
of its less-efficient 737-300s and using Airbus A319s.
It is looking for more revenue streams, plans to make greater use of its aircraft and their crews and will cut out 
expensive airports.
Zurich has already been axed and the use of Copenhagen and Amsterdam reduced. More routes will be added 
along with one or two new bases. Webster says he cannot give figures on potential savings.
He has no idea what Icelandic Air plans to do with its shareholding.
Webster expects consolidations and liquidations in the industry and says the key to success to will be the lowest 
cost base between any two airports.
The latest news on this front is the suspension of all flights by Volare. This helps Ryanair as a large proportion of its 
routes are to Italy.
Easyjet shares added 7.75p to 191.5p.

Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, today signalled a major expansion in its Italian operations following the collapse of 
Volare Airlines.
Volare, the Italian low-cost airline employing 1,400 workers, declared insolvency today after suspending flights last 
weekend.
Ryanair this morning said it would hold a press conference in Milan to unveil the airline's expansion plans in the 
wake of Volare's collapse. Last month, V-Bird, a Dutch carrier flying to Germany, also collapsed.
 The Italian airline's fall highlights Ryanair's comments on competition and price squeezing in the sector in the past. 
Ryanair's main European competitor, Britain's EasyJet, this morning announced a 20.8pc rise in profits, as it 
followed its rival Ryanair in warning that tough competition would force airline closures. Ray Webster, EasyJet's 
chief executive, warned that the growth to at least 47 in the number of European low-cost airlines, compared with 
seven three years ago, was "clearly not sustainable".

Singapore Airlines' regional subsidiary SilkAir has become the first Asia-Pacific airline to sign a deal for US 
company Aircraft Protective Systems' (APS) portable DigEplayer video-on-demand in-flight entertainment (IFE) 
systems. SilkAir says it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Washington-based APS under which it 
will introduce the DigEplayer 5500 system on its longer-range flights.
The portable, self-contained video-on-demand units will be customised for SilkAir to include 11 full-length movies, 
four television programmes, 80 audio tracks, six music videos and content for children. The system has already 
been ordered by several carriers in the USA, as well as European low-cost operator Ryanair (Flight International  28 
September–4 October).
The DigEplayer systems will be introduced on selected flights in January. They will be offered on a complimentary 
basis to business-class passengers, while economy-class passengers will be charged an unspecified rental fee. 
The airline has been exploring in-flight entertainment offerings for some time.

Handheld entertainment devices, on which airline passengers can watch films and television shows or play games, 
continue to catch on. The latest to introduce them is American Airlines, which is trying them out on some US 
domestic flights.
Content will include digital newspapers, which will be updated daily. The carrier will offer them free to first-class 
passengers and charge up to Dollars 12 in economy.
The devices, which have 8.9 inch LCD screens, are available on services from Chicago to Los Angeles and Seattle, 
from Dallas-Fort Worth to Seattle and from Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles. The trial will run until early February.
Ryanair has also introduced portable devices and KLM is offering them in a trial on flights from Amsterdam to 
Damascus, Amman, Beirut and Tel Aviv.

Jim French, managing director of FlyBE, the UK regional low fares airline, has not had to call in any fresh funds 
from his shareholders for quite some time.
He believes the group has finally found its niche in the fiercely competitive European airline industry, after ripping 
up a series of earlier business models that had only served to plunge the group deeper into loss in its previous 
guises as Jersey European and then British European.
If he is right, the turnround will come as a huge relief to the trustees of Jersey-incorporated Rosedale (JW) 
Investments, one of the Walker family trusts established to oversee the estate of the late Jack Walker, the former 
steel stockholding millionaire and owner of Blackburn Rovers.
The administrators of the Walker legacy have found themselves in the uncomfortable position of having among their 
main assets two of the business world's most notorious black holes for consuming cash - an airline and a football 
club.
There seems little prospect in the near future of the trusts offloading Blackburn Rovers, which is currently struggling 
close to the foot of the Premiership.
But they are hoping that an exit can be engineered for the reinvented FlyBE, the latest trading name of Walker 
Aviation.
If the strategy painstakingly put in place during the past two-and-a-half years can be shown to work, the trusts are 
hoping an initial public offering, a trade sale or a financial placement could beckon for FlyBE within two to three 
years.
 FlyBE sets a course for clearer skies: After the failure of earlier business models, the reinvented airline 
believes it has found its niche in the fiercely com....
It is early days but there are promising signs. In the first six months of the current year, the airline achieved a 
turnround from a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.1m last time to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 14m, in spite of a surging oil 
price.
The group expects to follow the seasonal airline pattern of falling into loss in the winter half-year. But Mr French told 
financial analysts last week that he was confident the airline would achieve "a solid operating profit" for the full year 
to the end of March - its first operating profit for five years.
The Walker trusts have shown great patience. In the two years to March 2002 they pumped in Pounds 22.5m of 
fresh equity to rescue the airline and keep it trading. In the past two years, FlyBE has depended on further windfalls 
to keep it afloat from the sale of lucrative take-off and landing slots, chiefly at London Heathrow airport, which 
brought in another Pounds 22.9m.
Now the airline must start generating money from its own operations if it is to survive.
Mr French has sought to transform FlyBE by taking on the practices of the most successful low-cost carriers - 
Ryanair and EasyJet in Europe and Southwest Airlines and JetBlue in the US.
But he has also sought a niche, which could save him from being crushed by such bigger rivals.
The evolving formula has been to create a national regional airline, with low fares and an aggressive national brand 
supported by heavy national advertising and a much reduced cost base.
It is developing a "backbone of Britain" strategy aimed at linking the UK regions, but largely avoiding flying into the 
highly competitive London market.
It has built its main bases at Birmingham, where it is the biggest single carrier; at Belfast City, where it has the 
largest domestic network from Northern Ireland; in the Channel Islands, from where it is the largest carrier to the 
UK; at Southampton, where it has grown from zero to 1m passengers in 12 months; and in the south-west of 
England, where it is quickly developing its presence at Exeter, its headquarters city, and at Bristol.
It is also growing from Glasgow and Edinburgh and in north-west England from Liverpool and Manchester.
The UK and Ireland domestic routes are expected to account for more than 80 per cent of FlyBE operations.
It is also developing some routes to the French regions and to European sun and ski destinations.
Like the successful low-cost carriers, it is driving booking traffic on to its website to cut distribution costs with 78 per 
cent of tickets now sold online and travel agent commissions cut from 7-9 per cent to 1 per cent. It is expanding 
revenues from online booking of hotels, insurance and car rentals, where it takes a commission.
Its aircraft are single class, onboard food and drinks must be purchased, tickets are non-refundable, and it charges 
fees for credit card bookings and ticket changes.
It is also radically cutting costs by simplifying its fleet to concentrate on the 78-seat Bombardier Q400 turboprop 
aircraft, one of the most efficient in its class, and the 110-seat BAe 146/RJ100.
Mr French believes FlyBE can charge a 10-15 per cent premium to other low-cost carriers for the use of convenient 
local airports.
If the model works, Mr French is hoping that the formula of the "national regional airline" could be introduced into 
other European markets.
First however, he must demonstrate it can deliver sustainable profits in the UK.

The twin effects of a sliding dollar and higher oil prices keep markets firmly in the red, but budget-airline EasyJet 
bucks the downward trend.
Fears that there is not enough fuel for the key winter period pushed oil prices higher today. US light crude rose 
above the $49 a barrel mark and London Brent gained 55 cents to $45.44 a barrel.
The dollar continued to test record lows against the euro following Fridays warning from Federal Reserve chairman 
Alan Greenspan that foreign investors may sell dollar-denominated assets if the US record current-account deficit is 
not reduced.
US futures point to sharp losses across the three major indices, with a bigger-than-expected drop in third-quarter 
earnings for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts adding to the gloom on Wall Street.
At 1pm the FTSE 100 had slumped 33 points to 4,728. The FTSE 250 tumbled 49 points to 6,551 and the 
techMARK was 11 points lighter at 1,191.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was off eight points at 1,020.
Higher oil prices failed to upset fuel-depended EasyJet (EZJ), which advanced 4.25p to 184p ahead of tomorrows 
results. The groups accompanying statement will be closely watched for news on the future ownership of the 
company after rival Icelandair bought a 10.1% stake in the group recently.
Other airlines were hit in the absence of bid speculation. British Airways (BAY) dived 5.75p to 218p, while Ryanair 
(RYA) slipped 0.5% to 5.03 on news that it will spend about £130 million to make Liverpools John Lennon Airport a 
hub for its operations.
Dollar weakness hit companies with significant US operations. Reuters was the weakest blue chip, shedding 14p to 
395p, with fading hopes for the sale of its 62% stake in Instinet, the US-listed financial data business, also 
contributing to its downfall. Analysts had estimated the sale could have raised up to $2 billion (£1.1 billion).
Other big US earners to fall out of favour included Pearson (PSON), down 12p to 623p, Amvescap (AVZ), down 
6.25p to 329.75p, and Sage (SGE), down 3.25p to 185.25p. Advertising giant WPP (WPP), down 9.75p to 580.25p, 
was also weighed by a downgrade from Cazenove.
Monday Lunchtime Market: EasyJet buoyed by takeover rumours
Xstrata, down 19.5p to 908.5p, was at the forefront of a weak mining sector on fears that it may be forced to 
increase its A$7.4 billion (£3.1 billion) hostile offer for Australian mining group WMC Resources.
BHP Billiton at 580p, Anglo American £12.61, Antofagasta £11,02 and Rio Tinto £15.16, were also among the 
biggest losers on the Footsie with losses of between 15p and 26p.
Land Securities, up 13p to £12.30, and a mmO2 (OOM), up 0.5p to 115p, were among a handful of blue chips in 
positive territory.
On the second line car retailer Pendragon (PDG) edged up a penny to 276p on news that it will be the sole 
distributor of Cadillac and Corvettes in the UK.
Evolution Group (EVG) slumped to 137p, its lowest level since June, before recovering to 143.5p, a loss of 3p. The 
stockbroker is under pressure following a report in the Sunday Times suggesting that some fund managers may 
boycott future fundraisings after profits warnings from two Evolution-backed firms, Medical Solutions and Plant 
Healthcare.
Among the minnows IP Live (IPV), which puts on stage shows, improved 1.5p to 56p after placing 1,375 million 
shares at 55p a share. The placing will raise over £750,000 for the company and will be used to expand its activities 
in the live entertainment market.
Kuju (KUJ), the game developer, jumped 2p to 12.9% after winning a fresh contract with a major publisher for its 
Brighten studio.

* TheEasyJet share price has risen by about 45 per cent in the last four weeks since Icelandair emerged as a 
surprise investor. The Icelandic flag carrier now holds about 10.1 per cent of Europe's second largest low-cost 
airline and has declared that it could continue buying. The Icelandair raid took advantage of this year's precipitous 
fall in the UK airline's share price, which had previously tumbled from a 12-month peak of 380p in January to a 
September all-time low of 118 1/4p. Despite its troubled share price performance, EasyJet will announce pre-tax 
profits of more than Pounds 60m for the year to the end of September, at least 16 per cent up from the previous 
year. In recent weeks, Ryanair, the rival Irish low-cost carrier, has forecast that competition and the decline in fares 
in the current winter season could be somewhat less fierce than it had previously indicated, so attention will focus 
this week on EasyJet's market forecasts for the coming year.
WEDNESDAY
* British Landis this week expected to announce a jump in net asset value - the key measure of a property 
company's performance. Consensus predictions from analysts suggest NAV of 1027p per share compared with 
870p a year ago. These interim results will be the first for Stephen Hester, who formally started as chief executive 
ten days ago. Mr Hester was formerly chief operating officer for Abbey National. Investors will be keen to hear 
British Land's views on the tentative rental recovery in London, where the company owns the Broadgate office 
complex. The group may also comment on the impact of proposals for tax-efficient real estate investment trusts that 
the Treasury could introduce shortly. There is likely to be a call on ministers not to ban upward-only rent reviews. 
Underlying profit forecasts for the halfway stage range fromPounds 73.6m to Pounds 82m, compared with Pounds 
65m a year ago.
* Icap, the interdealer broker, has seen its shares rise 25 per cent since the end of September when it said trading 
was rallying after a weak summer. At the time, it promised full-year pre-tax profits would be in line with market 
expectations, helped by reductions in costs. Icap said its own survey of analysts showed they expected pre-tax 
profits for the full year of Pounds 172m-Pounds 178m, compared with Pounds 170.2m last time. Financial traders 
have had a more sluggish summer than last year because of low volatility. Uncertainty over the direction of interest 
rates has kept speculators out of the markets and led to depressed trading levels and smaller price swings. Icap 
recently announced its share of the crucial US Treasury market had grown to 58 per cent. But US revenue growth 
Advertising pick-up set to boost Capital Radio : COMPANIES DIARY: TOMORROW
has been eroded as the dollar has fallen 10 per cent against sterling in the last six months. Icap, the world's biggest 
interdealer broker, has recently seen rival Collins Stewart Tullett acquire Prebon Yamane to create a rival hard on 
its heels in terms of market share.
THURSDAY
* Capital Radiois expected to unveil a strong advance in pre-tax profits, on the back of signs of returned buoyancy 
in radio advertising and a turnround in the ratings performance of the group's flagship station, Capital FM. 
Consensus forecasts suggest the company will achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 13.3m) for the 
year to September 30. The results come less than two months after the company announced a Pounds 771m 
merger with GWR, its fellow commercial radio company, which it argued would help lure listeners away from BBC 
radio, and advertisers away from television. Last month, the company revealed that it had managed to cement its 
lead over commercial rival Heart FM in the key London market, despite continued audience losses from its 
breakfast show, now hosted by Johnny Vaughan, who took over from Chris Tarrant in April. Investors will be looking 
for more guidance on the state of the advertising market during the current key period in the run up to Christmas 
and the New Year, along with any further details of how the company intends to leverage the potential cost savings 
and marketing benefits resulting from its planned merger.
* The weaker dollar is expected to take some of the shine of Johnson Matthey's expected first-half advance. The 
chemicals and precious metals company indicated in its September trading update that all four divisions, which 
include pharmaceuticals and coatings, were up in constant exchange rate terms. The company is expected to book 
a few exceptional items in the first half - it announced in September the planned closure of its UK gold refinery. A 
loss of about Pounds 12m before costs is also earmarked from the July sale of its pigments and dispersions unit. 
Merrill Lynch forecasts pre-tax profits for JM of Pounds 104m (Pounds 97.5m) for the six months to September 30, 
and earnings per share up 6 per cent to 33.8p.
* Halfords, the car parts and cycle retailer, is set for a bumper set of maiden interim results after reporting a 13 per 
cent jump in sales for the first 24 weeks. Sales are 11 per cent up on a comparable store basis. The results will be 
the first since the company floated in June. Merrill Lynch, company broker, believes sales over the full 26-week 
period have kept pace with the trend and is looking for Pounds 323m, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 
20.7m). It acknowledges this makes its Pounds 75m full-year forecast look conservative, but points to "strong 
underlying inflation" in Halfords' cost base and calls for detailed information on underlying sales and how the newly 
refitted stores are performing.
FRIDAY
* Fuller, Smith & Turner, the London-based real ale brewer and pub company, is expected to announce interim pre-
tax profits increased from Pounds 8.1m to about Pounds 8.3m, on sales ahead from Pounds 71.3m to Pounds 74m. 
The figures for the six months to September 25 are expected to reflect an uplift in sales from refurbished managed 
pubs and bars, and recovery from the trading downturn in the City of London. Analysts also expect the results to 
reflect an improved performance in the hotels division. On the other hand, forecasts have been restrained to factor 
in pubs being closed longer than usual for repairs and upgrades.

Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, is expected to announce on Monday that it is establishing its next 
European operating base at John Lennon airport in Liverpool.
This will take it to one of the longest established bases of EasyJet, the Irish carrier's key UK rival, as part of the 
increasingly bitter competition between the two pioneers of low-cost air travel in Europe.
Ryanair has also responded to EasyJet's recent decision to move for the first time into the Republic of Ireland, 
Ryanair's home turf. Two months ago, EasyJet announced that it was launching three routes from London Gatwick 
to Cork, Shannon and Knock in late January.
Ryanair took up the gauntlet yesterday, saying it would launch its own Gatwick to Knock route on January 19. It will 
raise the number of its flights from London Stansted to Cork and Shannon to four a day.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said: "EasyJet can never match Ryanair's low fares, our high frequencies 
and our punctuality or customer service for consumers travelling between Ireland and the UK."
Separately, Tony Ryan, founder of Ryanair and a non-executive director, yesterday said he had sold 5m shares in 
the company at Euros 5 a share, raising Euros 25m (Pounds 17.5m) and nearly halving his previous stake of 1.4 
per cent.
Ryanair has moved on to two of EasyJet's newest routes from London Stansted to Valencia and Almeria in Spain - 
a move described by EasyJet as "deliberate provocation" - and has expanded aggressively its presence at London 
Luton, EasyJet's headquarters airport.
Liverpool EasyJet already operates 13 routes from Liverpool while Ryanair has had only a limited presence.

Irish low-cost carrier, Ryanair, today said it would operate a new daily service to Gatwick from Knock and three

The Stansted routes will fly to Brno in the Czech Republic, Wroclow in Poland and Granada in Spain.
In addition, Ryanair also announced increased frequency on its existing routes from London Stansted to Cork, from 
three to four times daily, Shannon, from two to four times daily plus a second daily summer service to Nimes 
(France) from London.
 "Today's announcement of increased frequency on our routes from Stansted to Cork & Shannon (together with our 
new route from London Gatwick to Knock ) will continue to provide even more Ryanair low fares, better frequency 
and unbeatable punctuality for Irish and British consumers. Easyjet can never match Ryanair's low fares, our high

The Government was told weeks ago that Willie Walsh and his team would quit if new finance for the airline wasn't 
put in place, a report from the Irish Times said this morning.
A confidential report on the future of the airline prepared by merchant bank Goldman Sachs - and delivered to the 
Government in the autumn - predicted that "the retention of the incumbent management is likely to be put at risk 
without access to new capital for the company", the report said.
Chief executive of Aer Lingus, Willie Walsh, announced on Tuesday his intention to leave the airline next May along 
with the chief financial officer, Brian Dunne and the chief operations officer, Seamus Kearney. The three men gave 
no reason for their departure, but Walsh subsequently said the funding of the airline was one of the issues involved.
 According to Goldman Sachs, the management did not believe borrowing money to fund the expansion of the fleet 
in the absence of fresh capital was a viable strategy. Loading the balance sheet with debt to buy new planes would 
undermine the low-cost base that has allowed the airline to compete with Ryanair and other low-cost carriers, 
according to Goldman Sachs.

Ryanair today called on the government to make a rapid decision on awarding the contract to develop the second 
terminal at Dublin Airport.
Speaking at the first annual forum of the Irish tourist industry, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary noted that 
over two years have passed since the government received 13 separate expressions of interest to develop a 
second terminal.
"Two and a half years should be long enough for even Bertie Ahern to make a decision," he said.
 "Irish tourism is struggling simply because this Government prefers fudge and dither over decision. It prefers 
'consultants' and 'facilitators' instead of action. It is always just one consultant's report short of a decision," he said. 
O'Leary went on to say that, for over five years, Ryanair has offered to invest almost E1bn in new aircraft, based 
here in Ireland and to deliver up to 20 new low fare European routes bringing over five million new visitors a year 
and creating 5,000 direct new Irish jobs and over 25,000 indirect jobs.

A big jump in profits has not been enough to lift shares in airports operator TBI, but this performance calls for closer 
inspection.
Shares in the Mid 250 airports group (TBI) operating Luton, Belfast and Cardiff among others are unchanged at 77p 
after interims to end-September showed a big increase in profits. However this likely reflects a prospective price-
earnings ratio in an early 20p range, with investors wisely cautious about bidding the stock higher in the short term.
But despite TBI's fair rating and the ongoing risk of terrorism giving air travel stocks a temporary hit, TBI's 
performance merits attention. Regional airports are an interesting special situation theme, underlined by J O 
Hambro Capital Management, TBI's principal shareholder, recently buying more shares to own 7.53%. It also 
reflects bid potential.
Headline turnover, normally a focus for growth investors, edged up just 4% to £107.6 million. But operating profit 
rose 64% to £24.1 million and pre-tax profit soared 167% to £19.2 million in the absence of exceptional costs. 
However the proposed interim dividend is unchanged at 0.7p.
Passenger growth was nevertheless encouraging, up 12% to £10.8 million. The majority of this reflects expansion 
by easyJet and Ryanair at Luton, but growth was also seen across charter, full service and low cost - at almost 
every airport. This is an interesting reflection of growth credentials in regional airports generally due to more air 
travel and congestion at principal hubs.
TBI explains the mismatch with headline turnover on the basis that the impact on real growth 'is almost always 
muted initially because of reductions in average aeronautical revenues in the early years of new services coming on 
stream.'
A key management objective is proclaimed as succeeded: acquiring the remaining 28.6% of Luton airport it did not 
own. This was announced on 27 October but management is still enthusing about the benefits of full ownership. 
Some £30 million is being spent on expansion at Luton, expected to complete next July, providing capacity for up to 
12 million passengers a year and doubling retailing/catering space.
Luton saw like for like passenger numbers up 9% to 4.1 million, Belfast 12.5% growth to 2.5 million, although Cardiff 
slipped 4% to 1.2 million. Stockholm Skavsta saw 22% growth albeit off a small base, to 0.7 million as a result of 
Ryanair services. However management seems excited about progress at Skavsta given simultaneous growth in 
Edmond Jackson: regional airports in a special situation
commercial and aeronautical revenues per passenger. Lastly Orlando in Florida increased passengers by 50% to 
1.2 million despite the recent hurricanes.
With airlines announcing substantial capacity increases at Luton, Belfast and Skavsta, the effect should come on 
stream over the next 6 to 8 months. Trading in the initial weeks of the second half has been 'encouraging' with 
overall passenger numbers up 14% to 1.4 million across the group's four European airports. The main aspect of this 
growth is low cost traffic at Luton.
Meanwhile, over at airports group PlaneStation (PTG) the shares yesterday jumped nearly 20% to a mid-50p range 
by mid-afternoon; then settled up about 15% at 54p-mid price after some chunky sales. I felt the shares offered 
upside at 44/47p after a sharp fall linked with a consolidation (see CFD dealer, 5 November).
This may have reflected bear closing but a report last night said that advanced passenger sales for the group's 
Eujet are looking good. This rumour was circulating late last week. Be careful with PlaneStation in this respect, for 
on the downside there was no public admittance of the loss of MK Airlines' freight business, which coincided with 
the shares plunging. I continue to hold.
Both shares are interesting in context of the regional airports growth theme, with TBI offering one model of 
development while PlaneStation opts for vertical integration via moving to acquire EUjet.

More airlines face closure if oil prices remain at their current high levels, according to Ryanair's chief executive, 
Michael O'Leary.
"There are many companies which said they were already losing money when a barrel of oil cost USD25. 
In the meantime they have gone under," O'Leary told daily Publico paper, giving Swissair and Belgian national 
carrier Sabena as examples.
"Now a barrel costs USD50," he said. "I have no doubts that there will be more losses, more bankruptcies."
 Earlier this month Ryanair, which has promised not to introduce any of the fuel surcharges many of its rivals are 
imposing to offset high oil prices, posted a forecast-beating 15pc rise in first-half profits to E201.3m. O'Leary said 
Ryanair, unlike many other airlines, could still post a profit even if oil reaches USD75 a barrel because fuel makes 
up just 15pc of its costs.

Body
Tiger Airways, the Singapore-based low-cost airline, yesterday appointed Tony Davis of BMIbaby, the UK no-frills 
carrier, as chief executive.
Mr Davis, currently BMIbaby managing director, replaces Patrick Gan, whose departure from Tiger was announced 
last month - less then 10 months after he was appointed chief executive to prepare the launch of the carrier.
Tiger began flying in September from Singapore to Bangkok, Phuket and Hat Yai in Thailand. It is one of three start-
up low-cost carriers that are being launched from Singapore in less than a year to compete with AirAsia, which has 
pioneered the low-cost sector in Asia from its base in Malaysia.
Tiger is backed by Singapore Airlines, which holds a 49 per cent stake; Temasek, the Singapore state investment 
company with 11 per cent; Irelandia Investments, the investment vehicle of the Ryan family, which founded Ryanair, 
Europe's leading low-cost carrier, with 16 per cent; and Indigo Partners, the US aviation investment fund, with 24 
per cent.
Mr Davis has been managing director of BMIbaby since January 2002, when it was launched as the start-up low-
cost brand of BMI British Midland, the UK full-service carrier.
He was formerly BMI director of industry and government relations and previously worked for both British Airways 
and Gulf Air.
He developed BMIbaby as a smaller UK rival to Ryanair and EasyJet in the fiercely competitive European low-cost 
airline sector.
Tiger Airways is planning to service destinations within a four-hour flying radius of Singapore.
It has started operations with two Airbus A320s and plans to add at least four more aircraft each year and to fly to 
up to 15 destinations within the next two years.
Tiger hires BMIbaby man AIR TRAVEL:
The start-up airline had a difficult beginning to its operations in September, when its online booking system was 
overloaded, prompting a mass of complaints from customers.
It is also facing tough local competition from Valuair, which began flying in May, while Jetstar Asia, which is being 
backed by Australia's Qantas, is expected to start operations next month.

The three British travellers taking a late summer break in southern Greece were feeling smug. A tour operator that 
included their chosen hotel in its brochure had told them it had no availability. So they had booked accommodation 
with the hotel directly and bought their return flights on Britannia, the charter airline. As one said proudly, they 
saved a lot of money.
For half a century, millions of European leisure travellers have been content to let tour companies organise their 
holidays, bundling flights, airport transfers and accommodation into packages. But as the leaders of the 
international travel industry meet in London this week for one of its biggest trade exhibitions - the World Travel 
Market - there is evidence that the market is changing fundamentally.
The ease of booking cheap flights online with low-cost airlines and combining them with hotel rooms is enabling 
consumers, in some instances, to cut costs and create more flexible travel arrangements by avoiding the need to 
buy packages of one or two weeks.
The trend presents Europe's tour operators with a daunting set of questions. How many customers do they stand to 
lose? How should they respond? Have consumers developed enough confidence in their ability to organise foreign 
travel that they no longer need the guiding hand of a package operator?
Will that confidence extend beyond simple beach holidays or city breaks to more complicated trips involving multiple 
destinations? Will it survive if a major airline collapses, leaving thousands stranded or out of pocket because they 
have booked outside the current system of financial protection that covers inclusive tours sold in the European 
Union?
Total turnover of EU tour operators is estimated to be at least Euros 60bn (Pounds 42bn). Germany and the UK, the 
two biggest markets, account for perhaps Euros 25bn-Euros 30bn, followed by the Netherlands and Sweden. The 
Tour operators feel the pinch from DIY: PACKAGE HOLIDAYS: As more Europeans make their own travel 
arrangements online, holiday groups are rethinking their role,....
threat to the future of those operators has been apparent since the rise of no-frills airlines such as Ryanair and 
EasyJet. Yet surprisingly little research has been done on the extent to which those carriers have created a new 
market - in weekend breaks, for example - compared with the extent to which they have bitten into the existing 
package business.
Annual surveys by the UK's Office for National Statistics have begun to suggest a small shift in the balance 
between the proportion of British travellers taking inclusive holidays and those making independent arrangements. 
In 1998, package trips represented 53.9 per cent of the total. Last year that figure fell to 49 per cent. Until then, 
however, the total number of packages sold had continued to rise.
It is too early to say whether the fall in inclusive holiday sales in 2003 was more than a blip. But it is worth noting 
that, in the year to last June, capacity licensed to the eight major conventional UK package operators fell by 1.4m, 
while that authorised for Expedia, which allows customers to tailor holidays online, rocketed by 147 per cent.
The buzz phrase for such tailoring - putting together holidays from separate elements as opposed to buying a 
packaged deal - is "dynamic packaging". New software has simplified the booking process and retail travel agents 
as well as individual holidaymakers are increasingly taking advantage of this.
Mainstream tour operators inevitably will have to respond with their own offerings. Peter Rothwell, managing 
director of TUI UK, the travel operator, says: "If I looked ahead seven years, I'd say we would be selling about one-
third conventional packages based on bulk buying and value for money, one-third very cheap seats such as one-
way or long weekend flights and one-third holidays dynamically packaged by people wanting tailor-made holidays.
"Germany will probably go the same way, though travel sales via the internet have been slower to take off there 
than in Scandinavia or the UK." The key will be to provide flexibility, he says. "We have to recognise that not 
everybody wants the same level of service."
Peter Long, chief executive of First Choice, the travel operator, believes that no more than 20 per cent of today's 
conventional package holidaymakers will convert to independence.
"I would break the market down into two segments. First are customers who want to assemble travel arrangements 
themselves. A lot of that (business) is city breaks as opposed to longer holidays - though that will also come. 
Second, there are those interested in dynamic packaging. Is that having an impact on the mainstream business 
yet? I don't think so. Will it? Probably."
The two operators suspect that unless legislation forces low-cost airlines to provide financial protection similar to 
that demanded of tour operators, the collapse of such a carrier would drive customers back into their sheltering 
arms.
There are differences in their responses to the threat. TUI UK is building up its own low-cost airline, but First Choice 
has rejected that route. Mr Long says the future for mainstream operators lies in medium-haul and long-haul travel, 
specialist or activity packages and exclusive holidays.
Both agree that reports of the demise of package holidays are premature. Mr Long says: "If we were just in the 
traditional Spanish and Portuguese market, I think we would be wasting our breath because it's oversupplied, 
commoditised and whatever advantages we offer customers are prepared to wait for last-minute deals and take a 
risk.
"Their view is it is only two hours away and it's no big deal. When they travel further afield it's different. They want 
an organisation which is going to deal with any difficulties which arise."
WAGING THE BATTLE FOR INDEPENDENTS To combat the threat of do-it-yourself holiday bookings, tour 
operators will need to:
* Provide software that enables consumers to mix and match flights, hotels and holiday durations
Tour operators feel the pinch from DIY: PACKAGE HOLIDAYS: As more Europeans make their own travel 
arrangements online, holiday groups are rethinking their role,....
* Aggressively market consumer protection, much of it required by law, which pushes up operators' costs and is 
reflected in prices
* Concentrate on selling holidays that are relatively complicated to organise, to destinations that consumers are 
wary of visiting without knowledge and expert back-up
* Differentiate themselves by marketing exclusive packages such as all-inclusive arrangements incorporating sports 
or children's activities
* Rigorously control quality, partly by owning or leasing hotels

"When there are lots of alligators in the swamp, the fact that one is more friendly than others is of scant 
consolation." That is the view of Rod Eddington, British Airways' chief executive, who thinks a weaker dollar is the 
one friendly reptile that US airlines face. 
In BA's case, it has wrestled with cost and debt reduction, but still must deal with plenty of full-sized man-eaters.
BA's debt is now half the December 2001 peak of Pounds 6.6bn. Costs have been cut and profitability improved. 
But the outlook remains tough. BA broadly agrees with rival Ryanair's prognosis that the short-haul market may be 
a bloodbath. In long-haul, US carriers, some trading from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, have increased 
capacity on North Atlantic routes. BA, however, questions how much capacity they will be able to divert from 
domestic routes. Through hedging and surcharges BA is keeping on top of the fuel cost problem. But it expects little 
respite. At home it faces the challenge of improving the productivity of a unionised labour force, with which it has 
agreed a three-year pay deal.
Yesterday's results should dispel some of the bears' worst fears. But for BA's charms as a geared cyclical play to 
emerge, higher traffic volumes need to be accompanied by pricing power. Right now, the yield pressure alligator is 
still lurking in the swamp.

A bout of profit taking after yesterday's sharp gains send the Dublin market lower this morning, though AIB helped

By 10:30, the ISEQ index of leading Irish shares was down 10.27 points to 5,914.93.
Yesterday's rise in the index was led by a surge in Elan and Ryanair's stock on the back of positive corporate news, 
helping to lift heavyweight peers to fresh highs. Early trading this morning saw investors cash in and consolidate 
gains.
 Banks were lower with the exception of AIB, which saw its shares climb 19c to 1410 with 315,000 shares traded so 
far. The upward movement in the stock came after the bank's UK operations were voted top business bank in a

Ryanair, the no-frills airline, insisted it did not discriminate against a disabled man who was charged for the use of a 
wheelchair at Stansted airport as it began an appeal against a landmark ruling yesterday. However, the start of the 
hearing was delayed because no wheelchair was immediately available at the Royal Courts of Justice in London.
Robert Ross, who has cerebral palsy and arthritis, was awarded more than Pounds 1,000 compensation in January 
after he was charged Pounds 18 for use of a wheelchair through the airport as he travelled to Perpignan, France, 
on a Pounds 10 ticket.
Romie Tager QC, representing Ryanair, said it was not the airline that was discriminating against Mr Ross but the 
owner of the airport, Stansted Airport Ltd, a subsidiary of BAA, the airports group, which charged for the wheelchair. 
The airline claims it is appealing not because it has a dispute with Mr Ross but because it wants to force BAA 
Stansted to accept its responsibility to disabled passengers. Bob Sherwood

Leading London shares closed in negative territory after BA and Kingfisher reversed earlier gains and as Wall St 
got off to a poor start.
At the closing bell, the FTSE 100 index was down 23.20 points to 4,716.60.
London bluechips weakened as Wall Street shares fell to a bout of profit taking, prompted by the spiralling fall of the 
US dollar against the euro on the back of concerns over the world's largest economy's burgeoning current account 
deficit.
 Shares in UK flag carrier, British Airways, led the retreat as the company expressed caution about its outlook, 
saying tougher competition, especially from the likes of Ireland's Ryanair, would continue to squeeze average 
revenue per passenger and that high oil prices remained a threat. The airline published second quarter results with 
a 23.1pc increase in operating profits to £240m in the three months to September 30 compared to £195m in the 
same period a year ago. Shares dipped 5.25p to 219.25.

Ryanair today denied in the British Appeal Court discriminating against a disabled traveller by refusing to provide 
him with a free wheelchair at Stansted Airport.
The Irish no-frills airline told the court it prides itself on giving priority treatment to wheelchair passengers and even 
makes a loss on some tickets sold to them.
It is asking Lords Justices Brooke, Parker and Keene to overturn the ruling of Judge Crawford Lindsay QC at 
Central London County Court in January when he found the airline had discriminated against 55-year old father of 
three Robert Ross.
 The community worker from Islington, North London, was born with cerebral palsy and suffers from arthritis. He 
regularly travels from Stansted to Perpignan in France and after getting a cheap £10 flight objected to being 
charged £18 for the use of a wheelchair because he was unable to walk. Ross, backed by the Disability Rights 
Commission, won a total of £1,336 compensation comprising £36 to cover the costs of the wheelchairs he hired, 
£300 to pay for a new wheelchair and £1,000 for injury to his feelings.

It has also told them that they will have to repay the 15,000 euro cost of training them on the new 737-800 planes if 
they leave the airline before the five years are up.
The new planes are being brought in next year, and more than 90 pilots in Dublin need to be trained on them.
 The hardline approach by the airline was outlined at meetings last Thursday, according to the Sunday Times. The 
paper says pilots are set to resist the airline's terms. They claim that it is part of a wider and longer term effort by 
the airline to reduce their benefits and conditions. The pilots have, however, ruled out industrial action to oppose the

Making money out of airlines is a tough proposition. Just ask Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Atlantic. Asked 
once how to become a millionaire, he said: "Start as a billionaire and then buy an airline." Warren Buffett, the 
renowned US investor, is just as sceptical. The airline business has been a serial wealth destroyer since the 
maiden flight of the Kitty Hawk in 1903, he says.
Looking at how airlines have performed in the past few years, investors will understand these sentiments only too 
well. Intense competition, the World Trade Centre attacks, the Iraq war, cost-cutting by business customers, Sars 
and high oil prices have brought losses running into hundreds of millions of dollars for traditional carriers. The 
industry as a whole will make a loss for a fourth consecutive year this year. Even low-cost airlines have struggled 
because of increasing competition.
But the airline business is also one where you can make a great deal of money if your timing is right, partly because 
it is such a cyclical business. If you had bought the budget airlines, Ryanair and EasyJet, three weeks ago, for 
example, you would now be sitting on tidy profits.
Ryanair shares received a significant boost on Tuesday when the London-listed Irish airline indicated that this 
winter's price war would be less fierce than expected. It now predicts yields will fall 5-10 per cent from October to 
March instead of 10-20 per cent and says it is winning passengers because rivals are imposing fuel surcharges. 
This helped the airline report record first-half volumes and earnings, despite higher fuel costs and lower average 
fares.
The good news was enough to send Ryanair shares 21.4 per cent higher over the week to Euros 4.87. They may 
still have fallen 26.2 per cent since the start of the year - the company's January profit warning, its first, caused 
most of the damage - but the company's value has still more than tripled since its flotation.
EasyJet, one of Ryanair's biggest rivals, has also had a good week. It announced yesterday that its October 
passenger traffic was 25 per cent higher than a year ago and it was filling more seats - 87 per cent compared with 
85.5 per cent. EasyJet shares have also had a good run. Although still well below their 12-month peak of 389p, they 
 Things can only look up for some budget airlines CHRIS BROWN-HUMES ON LONDON
have climbed sharply in the past six weeks from a closing low of 118p in September. Yesterday they closed at 176 
1/2p. The recent purchase by Icelandair of more than 10 per cent of EasyJet's shares has boosted the shares 
although it seems to be a trade investment rather than the prelude to a takeover.
So has sentiment towards the low-cost carriers turned? High oil prices continue to be one of their challenges. It 
puzzles many that Ryanair can become Europe's most profitable airline when it gives so many of its seats away for 
virtually nothing. But it is ruthlessly efficient. Turnround times are fast, it cuts costs by using secondary airports and 
it even charges its pilots for their uniforms.
Squeezing costs further may be a challenge. But it is easy to make out a more positive case for long-term investing 
in this sector. First, penetration of low-cost air carriers is lower in Europe than in the US. According to the 
Association of European Airlines, budget airlines have 15-20 per cent of the European air traffic market. The figure 
in the US is nearer 30-35 per cent. So there is room for growth and the budget airlines seem to have the structure 
and flexibility to take advantage of it.
The European Low Fares Airline Association, which puts the share of low-fares airlines in Europe at 24 per cent, 
expects the figure to rise to more than 40 per cent by 2010. Second, there would appear to be scope for the no-frills 
carriers to increase revenue.
The latest plans involve cabin entertainment such as in-flight films and DVDs and on-board gambling.
A final point is consolidation. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, has long talked of a bloodbath in the budget 
sector this winter as intense competition has forced smaller rivals out of business.
He repeated the comments this week, saying higher fuel costs would only add to the squeeze. Some accuse him of 
exaggeration - it could well be that some of his earlier gloomy comments were designed to deter venture capitalists 
from funding rivals.
But there is no doubt that smaller airlines are going out of business. One recent casualty was V-Bird, a Dutch-
owned carrier flying out of Dusseldorf-Niederrhein airport in Germany. If the attrition rate accelerates, it can only 
make life easier for the likes of Ryanair and EasyJet in the long run. chris.brown-humes@ft.com

The FTSE 100 hit a 28-month high this week as investors on both sides of the Atlantic cheered president Bushs 
victory in the US election.
Uncertainty about the election outcome had weighed on the market, with little to choose between Bush and Kerry in 
the polls leading up to the election. The close contest raised fears that the legal dispute that marred the 2000 
election would be repeated.
Shortly after 2pm today the FTSE 100 was up 23 points to 4,751. Earlier in the session the benchmark had raced to 
4,761, its highest intraday level since June 2002.
The FTSE 250 was up 42 points at 6,508 and the techMARK was up 11 points at 1,166.
On Thursday the Bank of England kept interest rates at 4.75% for the third consecutive month.
The decision was widely expected but some strong economic data over the week raised slight doubts over the 
decision.
The Confederation of British Industrys monthly retail sales report showed a sharper-than-expected increase in retail 
sales in October to their fastest pace in three months.
Meanwhile Octobers Purchasing Manager Index of activity in the manufacturing sector rose from 52.2 in September 
to 53 in October.
However, today's data from the Office of National Statistics showing that industrial production fell by more than was 
forecast for the third quarter underlined the BoE's decision.
The Halifaxs latest survey on house prices showed a decline of 1.1% in October on September.
The data heightened fears that the housing bubble is on the verge of bursting, with a 27% jump in interim profits at 
McCarthy & Stone (MCTY) failing to alleviate the tension. The group also unveiled Howard Philips as its new chief 
executive.
Airlines had a bumpy ride over the week reflecting volatility in oil prices. Crude prices jumped following Bushs 
victory in the election before sliding after the US governments weekly inventory report revealed that crude supplies 
swelled by 6.3 million barrels last week. Oil prices touched a five-week low today.
Bush euphoria lifts FTSE to fresh highs over week
Turbulence in oil prices had minimal impact on fuel-dependent budget airline Ryanair (RYA), which soared after 
posting better than expected numbers. 
Elsewhere medical equipment supplier Smith & Nephew (SN.) was in demand after its third-quarter results came in 
ahead of forecasts. The group also impressed with a bullish outlook.
Investors pulled out of defence giant BAE Systems (BA.) after the Serious Fraud Office said it was investigating the 
group for suspected false accounting in some of its defence contracts with the Saudi Arabian government.
Venture capital firm 3i (III) delivered a robust set of interim results and offered an optimistic outlook. The group also 
agreed to pay Barclays' private equity arm £111 million for Hobbs.
Among the smaller caps motor and services vehicle group RAC (RAC) went into reverse after brokers acted 
negatively to the groups decision to transfer its Leyland part contract to Paccard for £18 million.
Pilkington (PILK), First Group (FGP), and Carphone Warehouse (CPW) all served up some strong earnings news 
but photo booth operator Photo-Me International (PHTM) was crossed off shopping lists after a solid first-half 
update was clouded by ambiguity over its potential for growth in the second-half.
Among the smaller caps AIM-listed investment company Melrose (MRO) said it was mulling a 140-150p per share 
offer for manufacturing group Novar (NVR), valuing the company at £640 million. The group said the offer would be 
structured as a mix of cash and shares and would involve a placing to help fund the deal. 
Shares in furniture retailer Courts (CRTO) crashed to an 18-month low of 37.5p. The group added to its catalogue 
of woes with a fresh profits warning, with business so grim that it has been forced to hold preliminary talks with its 
principle lenders.
Over the week the FTSE 100 has jumped 2.8% and the FTSE 250 has improved 3%. The techMARK celebrated its 
fifth anniversary this week with a rise of 2.7%.
In the same period the Dow Jones has added 2.8%, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 has firmed 2.9% and the Nikkei has 
gained 2.7%.

Ryanair already operates flights to eight airports in Spain.
El Pais cited O'Leary as saying that the low cost carrier is eyeing around 80 new aiports in total in Europe, as part 
of its expansion programme.
 "There is in fact a long queue of airports which are after our flights," O'Leary said. Ryanair is due to begin flights to 
Zaragoza from Dec 1, to Almeria from Jan 19 and to Seville in February, the newspaper said.

Half-term hols boost for Easyjet
Half-term hols boost for Easyjet

Half-term holidays and 18 new routes made for a good October at Easyjet and increased speculation that predators 
are sniffing round Stelios Haji-Ioannou's pioneering airline.
Easyjet carried 2.4 million passengers in October, 25% more than the same month a year ago. This takes the 
year's rolling passenger total to 24.8 million, 20% higher than the 20.6 million recorded in 2003 and goes some way 
to proving that there is more to European airline success than Michael OLeary's Ryanair.
These are the last passenger-carrying details before Easyjet releases its profit figures for the year on 23 November. 
News is expected on how Easyjet sees its short-term future in the light of the current high oil price.
The October figures show a 1.5% increase in the load factor to 87%, more impressive than the previous month's 
1% increase.
It said at the end of September that pre-tax profits for the year were likely to exceed £60 million, at least 16% higher 
than 2003. Unaudited revenue for the year is now £1.1 billion against £945 million a year ago.
Takeover speculation started bubbling two weeks ago when Flugleidir Fjarfestingarfelag, translated as Icelandair 
Investments, spent around £50 million acquiring nearly 33.6 million shares, approximately 8.4% of Easyjet's issued 
share capital.
Icelandair chairman Hannes Smarason was quoted at the time as saying the Easyjet stake was a long-term 
investment.
Easyjet said there had been no discussions with the Icelanders. The company would be treated the same as any 
other shareholder, it said in a blandly worded statement. It was glad that Icelandair Investments had seen the value 
of its business model.
A company called Teawood Nominees also raised its stake by buying an additional 6.7 million shares taking its 
stake 40.3 million shares or 10.1%.
Back in January Easyjet shares (EZJ) peaked at 380p. They have since drifted down with two sharp drops, at the 
end of April and the beginning of June, bottoming last month at 118.5p. After an early rally caused by an overnight 
fall in the crude oil price, the shares are now 2p better at 173.8p.
Half-term hols boost for Easyjet
Merrill Lynch reiterated its 'neutral' stance pointing out the numbers benefited from the half-term holidays. Panmure 
Gordon repeated 'sell' and 120p price target believing there will be no takeover and that competition and pressure 
on fares will remain strong.

Alpha Airports, the airline caterer and airport retailer, has secured Pounds 200m worth of contracts along with a 
Euros 7m (Pounds 4.9m) acquisition in Turkey.
The deals, announced yesterday, are expected to boost turnover - which was Pounds 441m last year - by almost 
Pounds 50m a year while Alpha's share price rose 3 1/2p to a record 93 1/2p.
The biggest deal is a five-year contract to run all the catering at Heathrow, Gatwick and Glasgow for American 
Airlines, thought to be worth nearly Pounds 20m a year. The deal replaces the capacity created by the recent loss 
of a contract with Air Canada.
The company has found a way into Turkey, which is seen as one of the fastest expanding UK holiday destinations. 
Alpha is buying a 60 per cent stake in Istanbul Duty Free, which runs shops at Ankara and Dalaman airports as well 
as shops at ports in Istanbul, Bodrum, Kusadasi and Antalya. IDF also provides in-flight retailing for three Turkish 
airlines.
"The acquisition in Turkey is a further stage in the development of our business in Europe," said Kevin Abbott, chief 
executive.
Alpha will pay an initial Euros 6m, with another two Euros 500,000 golden-handcuff payments by September 2009 if 
the remaining shareholders stay with the business. The deal is subject to anti-trust approval in Turkey that is 
expected to take about four weeks.
The Turkish move marks a significant geographic expansion for Alpha whose profits are divided between duty-free 
shops in 62 airports and in-flight meals for more than 100 airlines.
The company has benefited from intense competition within the low-cost airlines, which has led them to look for 
new ways of making money. EasyJet and Ryanair are two of Alpha's biggest customers, and the bulk of the 
revenue is from regional airports in the UK not run by BAA.

Body
Ryanair was a focus of attention for three international investment houses today after it delivered strong H1 
earnings this week.
New York investment house, Raymond James today maintained its "outperform" rating on Ryanair and raised its 
price target.
Credit Suisse First Boston upped its Ryanair target to E5 a share from E4.05 and kept a neutral rating on its stock 
on an improved earnings outlook.
 Meanwhile, Smith Barney, the research arm of investment bank Citigroup, said it was cutting its rating on Ryanair 
to "hold" from "buy" on valuation grounds and raised the target price to E5 per share from E4.4. Ryanair has a 
competitive edge over its peers due to its industry-leading low non-fuel expenses and healthy balance sheet, a 
Raymond James analyst said today. Analyst James D Parker said he believes that the company would not be 
significantly impacted in the near term by the rising fuel prices due to its strategic hedging policies and an increase 
in its average airfare. The talk had no discernible effect on the shares price in Dublin this morning with the stock 
trading flat at E4.69.

After shocking investors last January with its firstprofit warning, Ryanair has provided some comfort by saying it no 
longer expects the winter price war to be as fierce as it had forecast.
But while investor nerves were calmed yesterday - and both Ryanair and EasyJet share prices climbed sharply - 
Ryanair could ruffle more feathers in the industry with some of its latest cost-cutting moves.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, disclosed that the airline was employing up to 30 per cent of its pilots 
on contracts rather on the staff and that the share of contract pilots was likely to rise to 50 per cent.
About 30 per cent of the cabin crew were also employed on contracts through outside agencies, said Mr O'Leary.
In a filing at the end of September with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Ryanair disclosed that it had 
121 pilots under contract from "certain employment agencies that represent experienced flight personnel".
At the end of March it had 702 cockpit crew on the Ryanair payroll out of a total workforce of 2,302.
Mr O'Leary said that the contract pilots cost about the same as the staff pilots. They were paid 5 to 10 per cent less 
than the salaried pilots, but they flew 5 to 10 per cent more hours.
Ryanair was also increasingly recruiting pilots and cabin crew in central and east Europe, said Mr O'Leary. The 
share was currently less than 10 per cent but that was expected to increase, he said.
The hiring of large numbers of contract rather than staff pilots is unusual at established airlines, except where there 
is a need to fill short-term gaps in the workforce.
EasyJet, the rival UK low-cost carrier, said that it had nine contract pilots out of 1,100 and by the end of this month 
it would not have any.

have led to more non-staff air crew
"We only ever employ contract pilots on a short-term basis," it said.
"We have our own pilot recruitment team in house, and we think that is the best way to run our business."
Chris Avery, aviation analyst at JP Morgan, said that Ryanair was certainly "the market leader in contract pilots. It is 
not usually a recipe for harmony, but it does keep a lid on mainline pilot costs."
Jim McAuslan, general secretary of Balpa, the British pilots union, said that Ryanair was "the exception. But this is 
something that could grow, given that it is Ryanair".
Ryanair has its safety regulator, the Irish Aviation Authority, on its side, however.
A representative for the IAA said: "Contract pilots are routine in the industry. Once they are properly trained and 
properly licensed, the terms of employment are not a cause of concern for us. Whether they are employed on staff 
or under contract is not really an issue for us."
Separately, Mr O'Leary said Ryanair was making no provision for the unpaid airport charges at Stansted airport that 
are being claimed through a legal action by BAA, the UK airports group.
BAA said that it had established a provision of Pounds 7m against unpaid airport charges levied in the second 
quarter on Ryanair, which has its main base at Stansted.
BAA considers that Ryanair has "repudiated" its existing agreements as a result of the non-payment of the airport 
charges, and this has resulted in Ryanair being invoiced an additional Pounds 7m of airport charges during the 
three months to the end of September, which could rise to Pounds 25m in a full year.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair was making no provision, because it believed it would win the legal action. "They don't 
stand a chance," he said of the BAA action.
Equally, the airline was making no provision for the Euros 4m (Pounds 2.78m) claimed by the European 
Commission in repayment of illegal state aid subsidies received by Ryanair at Belgium's Charleroi airport, because 
it believed it would win the appeal.

Shares in Europe's leading low-cost airlines rose sharply yesterday as Ryanair signalled that the winter price war 
may be less fierce than forecast.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said that based on "current financial booking trends", the airline had 
revised its guidance, although he warned that high oil prices could still force some carriers into bankruptcy. Ryanair 
forecast a fall in yields, or average fare levels, of 5-10 per cent instead of the 10-20 per cent previously predicted for 
October to March.
Ryanair said its yields had declined by 5 per cent in the first half to the end of September, again less than originally 
feared.
Ryanair shares closed 64 cents, or 15.9 per cent, higher at Euros 4.67, while EasyJet ended 11p, or 6.9 per cent, 
higher at 170 1/2p.
Investors were encouraged that Ryanair had record first-half traffic volumes and earnings, with net profits rising 
18.5 per cent to a record Euros 200m (Pounds 138m), in spite of surging fuel costs and lower fares. The Irish airline 
had a 27.8 per cent net margin in the first half from April to September, seasonally the strongest months when it 
earns the bulk of its profits. Mr O'Leary warned that the airline would earn only a "tiny profit" in both the third and 
fourth quarters.
Ryanair has none of its fuel requirements hedged as of this month. Mr O'Leary said that, if the benchmark Brent 
crude oil price remained at Dollars 50 a barrel for the rest of the financial year to the end of March, it would add 
Euros 55m to the airline's total budgeted costs. Even with this, he said the airline would still achieve a net margin of 
about 20 per cent for the full year with a net profit of Euros 200m-Euros 215m, little changed from last year's Euros 
206.6m.
Chris Avery, aviation analyst at JPMorgan, said yesterday's reaction was "in response to the realisation that the 
low-fare model is in no way damaged". Even with oil at Dollars 50 a barrel, the company was still "guiding to Euros 
200m net income . . . The winter yield environment is nothing like as bad as they have been saying".
Ryanair plays down prospect of a price war
Ryanair has eased its drive to reduce fares and intensify competition to compensate, in part, for the added costs it 
faces from the surge in the oil price.
The group remained "by some distance" the most profitable airline in Europe and could absorb much higher oil 
prices and still offer the lowest air fares.
But Mr O'Leary warned: "Many of our competitor airlines who were losing money heroically when fuel was Dollars 
25 a barrel are doomed the longer it stays at Dollars 50.
Our prediction of a bloodbath and airline casualties this winter may be accelerated by record high oil prices as well 
as by irrational competition."
A recent casualty has been V-Bird, a small Dutch-owned carrier flying out of Dusseldorf-Niederrhein airport in 
Germany. Lex, Page 22 Contractors in the cockpit, Page 24 BAA deal to end Star row, Page 26 SAS cost

Ryanair had forecast that this winter European airlines would face a "perfect storm" of expensive fuel and falling 
prices. Given the euphoric reaction to the Irish carrier's first-half results, does the predicted tempest belong in a tea 
cup? Falls of 5-10 per cent in passenger yields were expected. 
Actual first half declines were 5 per cent, and only 3 per cent in the second quarter. For the rest of the year Ryanair 
now expects yields to decline by 5-10 per cent - half its previous forecast. The reason is, perversely, high oil prices.
Rival airlines have imposed surcharges on passengers to recoup higher fuel costs. Ryanair has been able to 
improve its relative price advantage without big price cuts. If expensive oil has a positive impact on revenue 
expectations, its negative impact on Ryanair's costs, relative to its peers, is overstated. Ryanair is now completely 
unhedged. But the derivative strategies of other airlines are only moderately value-enhancing, since most expire 
within two years. A Dollars 50 a barrel oil price, maintained for ever, would see British Airways save only a 
cumulative incremental Pounds 200m-Pounds 300m from its hedging positions. Yesterday's results confirm 
Ryanair's resilience, but do not refute its prognosis for the industry. Yield declines may be less fierce than expected, 
but at current fuel prices most European airlines are not viable businesses. Without significant capacity 
rationalisation, all they can do is pray for cheaper oil.

Leading European shares hit their best levels for more than three weeks yesterday as oil prices continued to ease, 
although equity volumes remained low as investors kept an eye on the US polls.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended 0.9 per cent higher at 1,016.13.
Banking stocks remained in the spotlight as the sector's third-quarter reporting season continued.
UBS unveiled a set of generally well-received numbers and the Swiss bank's shares rose 2.8 per cent to SFr89.95 
in response.
"These are in-line results in investment banking and - importantly - private banking, where UBS had very strong 
inflows and a good margin, demonstrating the difference versus Baer or ABN earlier this reporting season," said 
Matt Spick at Deutsche Bank. "UBS remains one of our top picks in the European banking sector."
Deutsche rates the stock a "buy" with a price target of SFr115.2.
ABN Amro staged a modest rally after falling back on Monday as its results disappointed investors. Dresdner 
Kleinwort Wasserstein downgraded the stock from "buy" to "hold" and lowered its target price from Euros 22 to 
Euros 19.60. The shares recovered from an early fall to finish 0.4 per cent higher at Euros 18.74.
But Erste Bank had a strong session as the stock continued to benefit from last week's bullish note from Credit 
Suisse First Boston.
CSFB initiated coverage of the Austrian bank with an "outperform" rating, saying it should be a core holding in any 
European bank portfolio as it has a comparable risk profile with the sector while offering superior growth. The stock 
climbed 4.6 per cent to Euros 36.50. Rival Bank Austria rose 3.5 per cent to Euros 60.01 ahead of its quarterly 
results tomorrow.
Falling oil fuels continental gains EUROPE:
Airlines had another strong session as the retreat in crude oil prices fuelled hopes of an upturn in profits in the 
industry. Air France-KLM rose 3.7 per cent to Euros 14.10, Lufthansa of Germany added 1.6 per cent to Euros 
10.51 and Spain's Iberia jumped 3.6 per cent to Euros 2.30.
Irish-based budget airline Ryanair climbed 15.6 per cent to Euros 4.66 after reporting an 18 per cent rise in half-
year profits and delivering an upbeat outlook.
But SAS, the Scandinavian carrier, slipped 1.5 per cent to SKr51 after it said pretax profits in the third quarter had 
plunged because of high fuel costs and slowing passenger growth.
Assa Abloy, the world's biggest lock maker, delighted the market by reporting strong third-quarter profits, raising the 
dividend and forecasting higher profitability next year.
But Credit Suisse First Boston said: "With the share price now trading near our SKr98 target price, we struggle to 
see much upside in the shares. We retain our 'neutral' recommendation."
The Swedish company ended the day at SKr104, up 8.3 per cent.
Volkswagen saw its shares advance 2 per cent to Euros 36.14 on optimism that the company may soon reach a 
wage deal with unions. A negotiator for the IG Metall union said signs of compromise had been found but they were 
still a long way from averting a full-blown strike in Germany.
Engineering group and truckmaker MAN rose 2.1 per cent to Euros 27.95 after it struck a cost-savings deal with 
staff at its struggling printing machine unit.
Thales, the French defence group, firmed another 3.6 per cent to Euros 29.43 amid continued speculation of a tie-
up between the company and DCF, the state-owned shipyard company.
Publicis, the French advertising group, rose 3.1 per cent to Euros 24.28 as investors waited for its quarterly figures, 
due after the close.

Geest, the food company, rose 3.7 per cent to 570p yesterday after Citigroup reiterated its "buy" recommendation 
and highlighted the increased probability of a takeover bid for the company.
Citigroup noted that Bakkavor, the Icelandic company that has built up a 20 per cent stake in Geest, had obtained 
authorisation from its board to increase its share capital. The investment bank also pencilled in a 650p bid price and 
pointed out that the six-month period during which Bakkavor was proscribed from making a full takeover offer ends 
on November 28.
J Sainsbury slipped 2.1 per cent to 261 3/4p after Jessica Sainsbury, whose father Sir Tim Sainsbury owns about 6 
per cent of the supermarket chain, expressed support for Justin King, chief executive, and his new strategy for 
recovery.
As the crude price eased, British Airways rose 1.3 per cent to 218 3/4p and ICI, the speciality chemicals group, put 
on 1.1 per cent to 215 1/2p.
Ryanair, the budget airline, added 16.7 per cent to Euros 4.68 after it reported record net profits in better-than-
expected interim results. Analysts highlighted that Ryanair expected average ticket prices to fall by 5-10 per cent 
over the winter, compared with earlier guidance of a 10-20 per cent decline. This could mean a less negative pricing 
environment for the sector through the winter, which could support Easyjet earnings estimates. Shares in the rival 
budget airline rose 6.9 per cent to 170 1/2p on heavy volume, which suggested Icelandair may have added to its 
10.1 per cent stake.
Vodafone put on 0.5 per cent to 140 1/2p after Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston recommended shares in 
the mobile phone group. Merrill said Vodafone would probably increase its interim dividend to a top-of-the-range 
1.9p, while CSFB highlighted a likely improvement in Vodafone Japan's competitive position against DoCoMo over 
the next six months. UK rival MMO added 0.9 per cent to 106 3/4p.
Geest upswing as Citigroup flags probable takeover bid LONDON:
SABMiller, this year's star performer in the beverages sector, rose 1.1 per cent to 800p after CSFB reiterated its 
"outperform" recommendation and raised its price target from 785p to 875p. The broker said recent strong share 
performance reflected investors' increasing appetite for the brewer's presence in emerging markets.
Buoyed by tracker-fund buying, HBOS put on 0.7 per cent to 744p, Barclays was up 2.1 per cent at 553 1/2p, 
Lloyds TSB rose 0.8 per cent to 438 3/4p and Royal Bank of Scotland added 0.5 per cent to Pounds 16.47.
A glimmer of bid hope remained in Matalan, limiting the fall in the shares to 1.1 per cent at 225 1/2p after the 
discount retailer announced a 1.2 per cent fall in interim pretax profits, in line with expectations.
Nick Bubb of Evolution Securities said: "We still don't know what will happen in the short-term on the much-mooted 
bid from Asda, but we still think the shares are a decent each-way bet as the recovery unfolds, and that John 
Hargreaves' hopes for a 300p share price are not out of order."
Kingfisher rose 2 per cent to 312 3/4p after Dresdner upgraded the DIY retailer from "hold" to "buy" and 
recommended switching out of Dixons, 0.6 per cent better at 174p.
RAC, the motoring organisation, fell 3.9 per cent to 640p after it warned restructuring costs from the acquisition of 
Axa's stake in their financial services joint venture would fall in 2004 rather than in 2005.
McBride lost 3.6 per cent to 148p after the maker of supermarkets' own-label household products suffered a small 
decline in UK first- quarter sales. But Ingrid Boon of Investec said: "In the long term the company is well positioned 
to benefit from retailer consolidation in Europe."

BAA, the UK airports operator, has reached agreement in principle with a group of the world's leading airlines 
including Germany's Lufthansa, United Airlines of the US, Air Canada and BMI British Midland on their future 
accommodation at London Heathrow, the world's busiest international airport.
Mike Clasper, BAA chief executive, said a memorandum of understanding would be signed with the Star airline 
alliance in the coming weeks for the carriers to move into Heathrow's Terminal 1, currently occupied mainly by 
British Airways.
The deal with the Star airlines ends a damaging dispute that became public in the summer when the Star chief 
executives launched a fierce attack against BAA over what they regarded as their unequal treatment by the airport 
group in its development of new facilities at Heathrow.
Star believed BAA had unfairly favoured BA, which holds about 41 per cent of the total take-off and landing slots at 
Heathrow.
BA, a leader of the Oneworld airline alliance, which is a big rival to Star, is due to move into the Pounds 4.2bn 
(Dollars 7.7bn) Terminal 5 at Heathrow at the end of March 2008.
The Star airlines demanded a guarantee of parity and the provision of competitive facilities to BA at Heathrow. After 
several months of negotiations they have accepted BAA's latest proposals for them to move into a modernised and 
expanded Terminal 1.
Mr Clasper said that BAA was also making good progress on other individual airline and alliance agreements at 
Heathrow. The SkyTeam alliance led by Air France-KLM is expected to occupy Terminal 3.
BAA yesterday said it had increased its pre-tax profits by 16.3 per cent from Pounds 312m to Pounds 363m in the 
first half of its financial year, and said it was on target to achieve passenger growth of more than 6 per cent in the 
full year.
Star airlines in Heathrow deal AIR TRANSPORT:
First-half passenger volumes at its seven UK airports rose by 7.5 per cent to 77.5m.
Turnover rose by 9.6 per cent from Pounds 1.03bn to Pounds 1.13bn, as the group recovered from its weak 
performance a year earlier, when the aviation sector was hit by the impact of the Iraq war and Sars.
BAA said it had established a provision of Pounds 7m against unpaid airport charges levied in the second quarter 
on Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, which has its main base at BAA's London Stansted airport.
BAA has also taken a Pounds 6m write-off on its Heathrow Express check-in facilities at Paddington railway station, 
to be closed next month.

Q2  profits rise by 14.9 pc at Ryanair
Q2  profits rise by 14.9 pc at Ryanair

Highlight: Low fares airline Ryanair has reported an 14.9pc rise in second quarter profit, better than expected.
Body
Low fares airline Ryanair today reported a 14.9pc rise in second quarter profit, better than expected.
It has also raised its second half forecast for yields.
For the second quarter period to Sept 30, the group's most profitable, the Dublin-based airline made a net profit of 
E147.6m - significantly ahead of analysts' consensus forecast of E130m and versus E128.4m last time.
 Ryanair said it currently has no plans to change its policy of remaining unhedged against fuel prices and estimated 
that if Brent crude remained at USD50 a barrel for the balance of the year its costs would increase by some E55m. 
It revised its guidance on yields (or average fare levels) upwards. It now expects a fall of 5-10pc in the second half 
versus previous guidance of a decline of 10-20pc. This will help offset the impact of higher fuel prices. The airline 
also claimed to be benefiting from the fuel surcharges imposed by other carriers. Chief executive Michael O'Leary 
said the board remains cautious on the full year outlook but he still forecast "significant increases in passenger 
volume growth... and increased load factors." For the six months to end-September net income was 200.1 m euro, 
up from E168.9m a year earlier. First half yields were down 5pc, at the lower end of the airline's guidance of a fall of 
5-10pc. Operating sales on continuing ops - E418.34m vs E351.22m. Results in summary: Net profit - 147.55m 
euro vs 128.42m Pretax profit - 162.74 m euro vs 142.47m Operating profit before exceptionals and goodwill - 
170.73 m euro vs 150.21 m Operating profit - 170.14 m euro vs 146.91 m EPS before exceptionals and goodwill -

Boeing has delivered the 1,050th and final 757 twinjet, to Shanghai Airlines. More than 1,030 757s remain in 
service. The first example of the type was handed over to the now defunct Eastern Airlines in December 1982. 
Boeing says the programme is ending as a result of "the capabilities of the Next-Generation 737 family and launch 
of the all-new 7E7 Dreamliner".

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair has paid back €4 million ($5.1 million) to Belgium's Walloon regional government, as

development cost of $2 billion. It wants government financial participation of $700 million, another $700 million from 
risk-sharing suppliers and the balance from the company. Bombardier says if it cannot get financing from Canada it 
will build the aircraft elsewhere.

Body
German low-cost airline Air Berlin and its Austrian partner airline Niki are in advanced negotiations with Boeing and 
Airbus over an order for up to 70 aircraft.
The privately-owned Air Berlin has become the second-largest German airline thanks to its rapid transformation 
from a charter airline into a predominantly low-cost scheduled carrier.
The firm order for 70 aircraft could be worth about Dollars 4.2bn at list prices, before heavy discounts. It is being 
fiercely contested by Airbus and Boeing, as it is likely to be one of the biggest orders for single-aisle aircraft to be 
placed this year.
The order, which will include options on a further 40 aircraft, is pitting the Boeing 737-800 against the Airbus A320.
Boeing has the advantage that Air Berlin currently operates an all-Boeing fleet, including 34 184-seat 737-800s, five 
737-400s and three 737-700s.
However, Joachim Hunold, Air Berlin managing director, said the airline had achieved sufficient scale profitably to 
pursue a dual fleet strategy. This approach has already been taken by easyJet of the UK in order to ensure 
competition in ordering new aircraft.
Mr Hunold said Air Berlin had become the third-biggest low-cost carrier in Europe after the two leaders Ryanair and 
easyJet, and it was also the third-largest operator at London Stansted.
Air Berlin bought a 24 per cent stake early this year in Niki, the start-up low-cost carrier launched by Niki Lauda, the 
former world champion Formula One racing driver, and is using it to establish a base in Vienna. Niki is launching a 
Vienna-London Stansted service, becoming the only low-cost carrier to serve the route.

There is little to stir much interest in UK markets as investors hang fire awaiting the outcome of the US election. The 
lower crude oil price lends some support to sentiment helping the FTSE 100 index to open 12 points better at 4,686. 
The FTSE 250 was up four points at 5,365 and the techMARK steady at 1,147. In Europe the CAC-40 in France 
and the DAX in Germany rose nine points and five points respectively. Leading shares recorded a majority of 
modest improvements, although BAA was little changed at 573p after revealing a 16% increased in first-half profits 
and a 7.5% rise in passenger traffic. Positive broker comment lifted Kingfisher 2p to 309p, Shire Pharmaceuticals 
3p to 529p, Reliance Security 4p to 498p and SABMiller 5p to 796p, but Hanson eased a penny to 410p in respect 
of the death of Lord Hanson. Profit-taking trimmed 3p from Sainsbury at 407p as a member of the family poured 
cold water on takeover speculation and Smith & Nephew gave back 8p of yesterday's broker-recommended 
inspired rise to 468p. Revived takeover speculation excited Geest at 568p, up 18.5p and Fenner attracted 
speculative interest at 129.5p, up 4p. A comforting trading update failed to help McBride at 147.5p, down 6p, and 
NETeller gave up 8.5p to 344p in spite of an upbeat article in the Financial Times. QA hardened 0.5p to 2.88p 
following an improving trend in revenue and operating performance and Tarsus Group jumped 6p to 121p on the 
appointment of Roger Pellow as executive director. 
Ryanair flew up 0.33p to 4.34p after announcing better-than-expected profits and Big Yellow was a good market at 
179.5p, up 8.5p. Matalan slipped 3p to 225p and Morse Holdings slipped 2p to 115p despite satisfactory trading 
updates and RAC dipped 9p to 657 on its decision to transfer its Leyland parts contract to Paccard for £18 million. 
Great Portland Estates softened 2p to 303p on the sale of its Bond Street property for £50 million, making a profit 
on book value of £6.5 million. iTrain shed a penny to 8.5p on confirming acquisition talks which may result in 
fundraising.

Leading London shares made gains again today as oil prices on the international market fell to around the USD50 a 
barrel mark.
At the closing bell, the FTSE 100 index was up 19.4 points to 4,693.20.
Oil prices on the main exchanges continued lower today to touch below the USD50 a barrel mark on the NYMEX 
exchange, easing investor fears that high fuel prices would impact on corporate earnings and feed into inflationary 
pressure. London bluechips were also given a boost from a positive start to Wall Street trading ahead of a final 
result on the news US President.
 The fall in oil prices lifted airline shares with UK flag carrier British Airways up 3.25p to 219.25 as pressure to 
increase ticket prices eased. Irish FTSE 250-listed budget airline, Ryanair, jumped 12pc after it reported a rise in 
first half profits that beat forecasts and was more upbeat than previously over prospects for the full year. Shares in 
Ryanair's main rival, EasyJet, gained 6pc.

Ryanair flies on with no-hedge bet
Ryanair flies on with no-hedge bet

Ryanair and chief executive Michael O'Leary have done it again; better than expected second quarter results 
persuade investors to overlook the lack of a hedge against fuel prices and shares in the no-frills airline fly.
Shares in Ryanair (RYA) surged 9% to 4.37 as new record traffic and profit figures for the three months to 30 
September gave the no-frills airline the 30th consecutive quarter of unbroken profitability since floating in 1997.
Although OLeary says Ryanair will remain by some distance Europes most profitable airline, with increases in 
passenger volume and higher load factors helping offset high fuel charges, he is cautious about the rest of the year.
Despite increases in route charges and fuel prices, we continue to generate better margins than all our competitors 
he says.
Ryanairs world record margins enables us to absorb higher fuel prices - without resorting to surcharges. We will 
continue to grow profitably and remain Europes fastest growing airline.'
With 14 million passengers, 24% more in the first half of the year than in 2003, Ryanair revenue rose from 596.4 
million to 721.1 million, up 21%. Adjusted profits after tax rose 15% to 201.3 million against 175.5 million.
OLeary has continued to keep costs down and if he has a secret this is it. If route and fuel charges are excluded, 
costs fell 4%. Put the two together and costs are flat, squeezing margins 1% to 28%.
Along with the introduction of new aircraft, continued route growth has been crucial and 41 were added during the 
summer. Instead of one Boeing 737-200 at Luton there will be four of the more cost-efficient 737-800s. New low-
fare flights will start to Riga in Latvia, Santander, Seville, Valencia and Porto.
Ryanair benefited from the decision of its competitors to impose fuel surcharges which made its fares more 
attractive. The lowest fell 5%, it lost less bags than anyone else and has the best punctuality with fewer 
cancellations, adds OLeary.
We continue to aggressively attack costs and have recently agreed the forward sale of our remaining 737-200 fleet 
for $10 million as well as a new ten-year engine maintenance contract with General Electric which locks away 
significant cost reductions.
Ryanair flies on with no-hedge bet
When a year ago, during the run up to the Iraq War, the cost per barrel of oil surged, Ryanair stopped its forward 
hedging policy.
OLeary says that from this month Ryanair is unhedged and will remain so until forward rates return towards their 
previous normal levels.
$50 a barrel for Brent crude for the remainder of this fiscal year will add some 55 million to our total budgeted costs. 
However, the multiple fuel surcharging policy of our competitors has seen our rate of yield decline ease. These 
stronger than expected yields will partially offset our higher fuel costs.
Furthermore, many of our competitor airlines, who were losing money heroically when fuel was $25 per barrel, are 
doomed the longer it stays at $50. Our prediction of a bloodbath and airline casualties this winter may be 
accelerated by record high oil prices as well as irrational competition.
Citywire Verdict:Tough talking OLeary has upset many people over the years, but he has never failed to deliver as 
today's interim figures demonstrate. However, the whole edifice is underpinned by a high risk bet on oil prices. 
However, lean and mean Ryanair may be compared to its rivals, should oil prices continue to remain high it is hard 
to see how the company can continue to cut costs and prosper. Note, O'Leary says the better than expected yields 
it is enjoying only partially offset higher fuel costs. He may pull off this bet, then again he may not.

Body
The Dublin market closed higher for the second straight day today as corporate news boosted both Ryanair and 
Elan shares.
At the closing bell, the ISEQ index of leading Irish shares was up 54.64 points to 5,778.50.
Ryanair dominated trading on the ISEQ today as investors hailed its half-year trading figures. The airline reported a 
14.9pc rise in second quarter profit, and raised its second half forecast for yields. For the second quarter period to 
Sept 30, the group's most profitable, the Dublin-based airline made a net profit of E147.6m significantly ahead of 
analysts' consensus forecast of E130m and versus E128.4m last time. Shares shot up almost 16pc or 63c to 466 
on the news. On the FTSE 250 in London, the stock rocketed 12pc higher.
 Elan was the next main focus of investors' attention after the Standard & Poor's agency gave it a ratings boost. The 
Irish drug company's B-corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings and its CCC senior unsecured 
convertible note and subordinated debt ratings, have been placed on CreditWatch with positive implications. Shares 
climbed 35c to 2072.

Claims of 'strong progress' from FTSE 100 companies almost always deserve scepticism; by contrast BAA speaks 
modestly of 'robust' performance in its interim results - but boy, is the claim substantiated.
I also note how operating profit in the six months to the end of September is not presented on a 'normalised' basis, 
so you have to scour the statement for exceptional charges. BAA is up-front about an 11.4% rise in operating profit 
to £391 million, after a £6 million asset write-off. Otherwise the profit rise was 13.1%.
Targets were met for passenger traffic, up 7.5% to 77.5 million. Both pre-tax profit and earnings rose over 16%, to 
£363 million and 23.6p respectively, although the interim dividend rose more modestly by 4.5% to 6.9p. 
Encouragingly, group revenue rose 8.9% to £1.1 billion, which is respectable indeed for a large company.
With fears of global terrorism receding, BAA (BAA) currently comes across as a stable company and one that is 
potentially entering a new phase of growth. Its share price has traded sideways in recent years, and at 575.75p, up 
2.25p, it is midway in a 400p to near 700p range. Pre-tax profit has been stuck stubbornly at about £530 million a 
year, but the consensus forecast now anticipates £611 million in the year to end-March 2005 and £688 million in 
2005/06. This just amounts to double-digit earnings growth, but for a FTSE 100 company capitalised over £6 billion 
that is very respectable and more professional investors could warm to BAA.
At about 14.5 times, the shares' price-earnings ratio appears to reflect this already, although it is not unusual for 
respected FTSE 100 shares to sustain a premium. Personally I can't go along with this kind of investing, I prefer to 
be able to quantify a margin of safety in the numbers. But I recognise that fund managers may buy according to the 
story and respect for management. Things could well be looking better for BAA shares.
Gearing has risen from 49% to 62% though that makes sense in context of investing for growth. BAA says it has 
improved security, safety and services, and delivered new airport facilities on time and to budget. Although net retail 
income per passenger appears static and there is a caution about 'the continuing challenge of difficult industrial 
relations across much of the aviation industry'. Yet today's statement is positive about the second half.
A £7 million provision has been established in relation to litigation with Ryanair, and there was a £6 charge for 
Heathrow Express check-in facilities at Paddington after two airlines ceased to use them.
Obviously an aspect of relative growth is a weak first quarter comparison (due to war in Iraq and the SARS virus). 
Heathrow's passenger growth of 7.6% was in line with overall numbers at BAA's UK airports, and benefited from 
10.1% growth in North Atlantic traffic and a 15.1% rise in other long haul passengers.
Edmond Jackson: watch out for BAA
Total airport revenue rose 9.2% implying some airports are doing less well in context of Heathrow up 13.1% and 
Stansted up 14.9%. Gatwick appears to have been adversely affected by a decrease in the European charter 
market although it is also said to be benefiting from low cost carriers.
Abroad, there was genuinely strong growth at Naples and Melbourne, where passenger growth was 17.9%. Yet 
performance was mixed on the basis of total revenue growing only £1 million to £34 million.
First half capital expenditure rose 17.6% to £709 million, with over half relating to Heathrow's Terminal 5. This is 
approaching the halfway stage and remains on budget and ahead of schedule.
This is indeed a robust outcome that should please fund managers, with BAA getting on more of their lists. A 'hold' 
rating appears justified if you already do. For enterprising private investors, however, there will be more exciting 
opportunities.

Body
A surge in buying of Ryanair shares send the Dublin market higher this morning after better-than-expected profit 
figures from the airline.
By 10:30, the ISEQ index of leading Irish shares was up 22.66 points to 5,746.52.
Ryanair dominated trading on the ISEQ this morning as investors hailed its half-year trading figures. The airline 
reported a 14.9pc rise in second quarter profit, and raised its second half forecast for yields. For the second quarter 
period to Sept 30, the group's most profitable, the Dublin-based airline made a net profit of E147.6m significantly 
ahead of analysts' consensus forecast of E130m and versus E128.4m last time. Shares shot up 9pc or 36c to 439 
on the news.
Profit taking dominated elsewhere on the index after yesterday's rebound with banks bearing the brunt of the sell-
off. AIB shares inched down 1c to 1379 with 71,000 shares traded so far. Bank of Ireland shares dropped 5c to 
1082 after Bank of Ireland Asset Management was reported to have lost a second big client in a month, in the wake 
of several of its investment managers jumping ship.

Interest rate fears return as data shows a sharper-than-expected rise in retail sales and the FTSE 100 remains 
buoyed as investors hold their breath ahead of todays US election.
According the Confederation of British Industry, retail sales rose at their fastest pace in three months in October, 
with 37% of firms seeing a rise in sales in the month and 26% reporting a fall, giving an overall balance of +11, well 
above Septembers 18-month low of 9.
The data could encourage the Bank of England to make further hikes in interest rates.
However, John Longworth, chairman of the CBI, urged the BoE to resist raising rates again, pointing out that sales 
growth was still below normal levels last month and that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the economic 
cycle.
Trading has been subdued ahead of the US election result, expected in the early hours of tomorrow morning.
At 12.50pm the FTSE 100 was up seven points at 4,681, the FTSE 250 was 26 points higher at 6,387 and the 
techMARK was up two points at 1,149.
The FTSE Eurotop 300 was up four points at 1,011.
Right up to the last minute polls have shown that President Bush and senator John Kerry are deadlocked, raising 
concerns that there will be no clear winner once the voting ends.
With little economic or corporate data coming out of the US, investors are expected to draw some encouragement 
from the latest dip in oil prices. US futures point to gains across the three major indices on open.
Speculators foreseeing a Kerry victory encouraged some selling of oil after the Democrat candidate said he would 
halt plans to fill the US strategic petroleum reserve at high prices to keep more crude on the market if he becomes 
president.
However, news of the sabotage of three pipelines in Northern Iraq provided prices with some support.
US light crude fell further back from yesterdays one-month low with a drop of 18 cents to $49.95 a barrel. London 
Brent was down 39 cents at $46.67 a barrel.
Tuesday Lunchtime Market: retail sales revive
Shell, down 4p to 426p, was the biggest loser among the oils, with the sale to Mitsui of a 25% stake in the Mexican 
LNG terminal, worth about $100 million, having little impact.
BP (BP.) at 530.75p, BG (BG.) 357.75p, and Cairn Energy (CNE) £14.73, were down between 1.25p and 5.5p.
However, investors jumped on board airlines as lighter oil prices increased sentiment in the fuel-dependent sector.
British Airways rose 2.75p to 218.75p ahead of next Mondays numbers, shrugging off rumours of a possible rights 
issue.
Low-cost rival Ryanair surged by more than 11%, or 45 cents, to 4.46, after posting better than expected numbers 
and rival EasyJet, which has been the subject of bid speculation recently, fronted the mid-cap leaderboard with a 
rise of 8.25p to 167.75p. Airport operator BAA trimmed 1.5p to 572p in response to a 16% interim profits increase 
and 7.5% rise in passenger figures.
Elsewhere Kingfisher put on 3.25p to 310p on the back of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein's upgrade from hold to 
buy. The broker advised clients to switch out of Dixons (DXNS), up 1.25p to 174.25p, and into B&Q owner 
Kingfisher, feeling that Kingfisher has better retail and supply positioning than Dixons.
Profit-taking cut 5.25p from Sainsbury at 262pp as a member of the family poured cold water on takeover 
speculation and Smith & Nephew was the weakest blue chip, giving back 11p of yesterday's broker-recommended 
inspired rise to 476p.
On the second line RAC dipped 18p to 648p on its decision to transfer its Leyland parts contract to Paccard for £18 
million but revived takeover speculation excited Geest, up 19.5p to 569p.
Among the smaller caps real estate play A&J Mucklow (MKLW) held steady at 322.5p after unveiling the acquisition 
of a building in Worcestershire for £2.3 million.
Multi-media training and recruitment firm iTrain sank 10.5%, or 1p, to 8.5p on confirming acquisition talks which 
may result in a fundraising.
Computer services firm QA hardened 0.5p to 2.88p following an improving trend in revenue and operating 
performance.

(Update) British Airways gains 5p to 221p, shrugging off rumours of a possible rights issue with next Monday's 
figures and encouraged by a relapse in the crude price. Better-than-expected profits from low-cost rival Ryanair, 38 
cents firmer at 4.39, also help. BAA improved 3p to 577p in response to a 16% interim profits increase and 7.5% 
rise in passenger figures. Overall markets remain firm, but subdued ahead of the US election result expected in the 
early hours of tomorrow morning. By 10.30am the FTSE 100 index was up eight points at 4,681 and the Mid-250 
index 22 points higher at 6,383. In Europe both the CAC-40 in France and the DAX in German were trading around 
eight points firmer. An upbeat statement from Portugal Telecom lent some support to telecoms where Vodafone 
(VOD) was attempting to break through the 140p resistance level at 140.25p and mmO2 (OOM) hardened a penny 
to 106.75p. Shell eased 3p to 427p, news of the sabotage of three northern Iraqi oil pipelines and the sale of a 25% 
stake in the Mexican LNG terminal to Mitsui making little impression for now. Imperial Tobacco gave up 11p to 
£12.85 and fading bid hopes left Sainsbury (SBRY) trailing 5p lower at 262p, but Kingfisher hardened 3p to 309p 
and SABMiller rose 8p to 800p after positive broker comment. Good figures yesterday lifted Matrix Communications 
7.5p to 133p and Cheerful Scout 0.05p to 0.80p, but possible fundraising moves to finance an acquisition 
overshadowed iTrain at 8.5p, down a penny. 
Razorback Vehicles softened another penny to 14.5p as it warned yesterday of more funding required for its 
distribution roll-out, while profit-taking knocked 10.5p from Chelford Group at 167.5p and 31p from Falkland Islands 
Holdings at 605p. Matalan held steady at 228p, recovering an early post-results fall after receiving positive 
recommendations from several brokers. Scottish Radio dipped 15 to 925p on the absence of firm bid news from 
rumoured predator Emap, 804p, up 8p.

 The three most senior managers at Aer Lingus have resigned after disagreeing with the Irish government over the 
future strategy of the airline. Brian Dunne, the Irish flag carrier's chief financial officer, will be leaving in May along 
with Willie Walsh, the airline's chief executive, and Seamus Kearny, the chief operating officer. "Our overriding 
feeling was that we felt that we have taken the business as far as we could in the current environment and over the 
last few months we have met with growing resistance to the changes in our business model," says Dunne. 
"Our vision required clarity on funding and, as this was not forthcoming, we decided that it was in our best interests 
to leave." Walsh and Dunne have denied they are leaving Aer Lingus in order to mount a takeover of the airline 
after the Irish government rejected the idea of a management buy-out earlier this year. "We have given six months' 
notice and it is our intention to stay the full six months," says Dunne. "I have no plans for the future at the moment 
but I still have six months to decide." Martin Cullen, the Irish transport minister, will meet with John Sharman, the 
chairman of Aer Lingus and a managing director of Spectrum Capital, to discuss possible replacements. Sharman 
praised the contribution made by the three men in shaping Aer Lingus' fortunes. "It is with regret that I accept these 
resignations as all three have played an important role in the turnaround of Aer Lingus thereby placing the airline on 
a strong competitive footing," said Sharman in an official statement. "On behalf of the board of Aer Lingus, I would 
like to thank each one of them for their significant contribution. The board of Aer Lingus will ensure a smooth and 
orderly transition over the coming months, consolidating the progress made by the airline and building upon it." 
Dunne worked at Arthur Andersen for 14 years before joining Aer Lingus in October 2001. Since then he has played 
a key role in stabilizing the business and transforming it into a viable competitor to Ryanair and with US airlines on 
transatlantic routes. In particular, he concentrated on cost cutting, which had resulted in a reduction in costs of 30% 
by the end of 2003. He also transformed the airline's cash and liquidity position by focusing on asset sales and new 
aircraft financings. Dunne has also been in control of the airline's fleet-replacement programme and, in November 
2004, he successfully closed Japanese operating leases on four of the seven new A320s ordered from Airbus in 
2003. Dunne leaves Aer Lingus on a strong financial footing. The carrier posted a 30% rise in full-year profits in 
2003 and is introducing four new European routes in 2005. n

Highlight: No one can doubt the success of low-cost airlines such as JetBlue, Southwest, Ryanair and Air Asia - 
but are they running out of ideas. By Alexandra Lennane.
Body
 Low-cost carriers operated 28,000 flights a week in the year 2000; three years later, they flew 43,000 a week. In 
Australasia this increase was from 136 to 1,360 flights each week, in Europe flight numbers were up 140% and in 
the US 27%. Budget carrier capacity grew by 69%, compared with an 8% fall in total global airline capacity. Now 
one in five 737s is operated by a low-cost carrier. Expansion by established low-cost carriers is responsible for 
much of this growth, and much of it can be put down to the creation of a bigger market. But as more airlines launch 
and networks grow, low-cost carriers are starting to compete head to head. 
Analysts looking at the spider's web-like route network in Europe, in particular, are beginning to ask whether the 
low-cost market is saturated. Meanwhile, full-service carriers have lifted their game and begun to compete where it 
matters, through price. In this increasingly difficult operating environment, all airlines are looking at what competitive 
differentiators they can offer, and when received knowledge rules that the business model for a low-cost carrier is 
inflexible, how can low-costers get the edge over one another? The challenge is on for airlines either to increase 
ancillary or core revenues, or to cut costs. Many costs, of course, are relatively inflexible - fuel, maintenance, 
insurance, lease charges. But low-cost airlines are starting to ask all over again whether cost savings can be made 
elsewhere - or whether increasing some costs could lead to greater revenues, if passengers opt for a few frills. 
Andrew Cowen, former finance director of go, the UK low-cost carrier, and now managing partner of consultancy 
firm Mango Aviation, believes that price remains the first differentiator, and one that passengers value the most. 
"Overall, it is clear from the evidence that price remains by far and away the primary consideration in passenger 
selection decisions, particularly among the leisure and visiting friends and relatives market. Ryanair's robust 
approach to customer service, flying to airports some way from city centres, underlines this. So it remains the case 
in my view that airlines cannot stray too far from the basic low-cost carrier model." Peter Harbison, managing 
director of the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, believes that being a low-cost carrier is a "state of mind", and that 
the basic model can be adapted, so long as airlines believe that "nothing conventional is acceptable. Airlines must 
constantly challenge accepted truths about costs". 
 Running out of ideas? The main proponent of this philosophy is Ryanair. The airline has announced plans to 
remove window blinds to save costs. "They are clearly starting to scratch the bottom of the barrel with ideas such 
as this," says Cowen. "Yet at the same time, this is an example of how they will leave no stone unturned and are 
willing to challenge the status quo in every conceivable way and then some." Ryanair will also, from next year, try to 
How low can they go? 
discourage passengers from bringing luggage on to the aircraft, in a move designed both to reduce aircraft weight 
and cut out the need for check-in queues, as passengers print their own boarding cards. Ryanair, which will charge 
passengers about £50 ($93) per bag, says the change is not about raising ancillary revenue, but about cutting 
costs. Chief executive Michael O'Leary told a press conference that the move was "not to make money from 
checked-in luggage - the purpose is to get rid of it altogether". Ryanair believes the change could cut E50 million 
from its E150 million annual airport costs. Malaysia's Air Asia is thinking along the same lines. Bernard Francis, 
senior manager revenue, route and distribution, admits: "Our biggest competitor is our own cost." Air Asia's cost is 
2.5 cents per ASK, but it is constantly looking to reduce this. For example, pilots do their own load sheets which, 
Francis claims, brings in a 10% to 15% saving on fuel. As airlines dig deeper to reassess all their costs, there can 
be the happy coincidence of a cost cut that brings added value to the customer. Francis explains: "We realized that 
by having leather seats on our aircraft, we could increase turnaround time as they are much easier to clean." 
Leather seats also have a lower lifetime cost than cloth seats, and carriers such as Air Arabia and Ryanair are 
introducing them on their aircraft. While reducing costs is part of a low-cost carrier's daily work, Cowen adds: "In the 
main, I think it is clear that ancillary revenues offer some of the biggest areas for profit improvement." Many low-
cost airlines are also using this revenue stream as a way to characterize their airline, and differentiate it from others. 
Australia's Virgin Blue stands by this philosophy. It claims to offer a "business class" at negligible extra cost to itself. 
It charges more for exit row seats, which have a bigger seat pitch, and offers valet parking and a lounge area at the 
airport - in fact everything a business-class traveller would expect apart from a frequent-flyer programme, all for 
about $35 more per ticket. Certain services can create value for the customer and ancillary revenues for the carrier 
- a win-win situation. On-board catering has become one of the most important sources of extra revenue, and 
passenger satisfaction. "Low-cost carriers have specific needs for on-board catering," says Stephan Egli, senior 
vice-president global marketing at LSG Sky Chefs. "They want no extra crew, complexity, overheads, turnaround 
time, space or capital expenses. They don't like handling cash, and they don't want to do the forecasting." 
Lufthansa Sky Chefs has set up a service to help airlines maximize the available galley space, which for most 
carriers is pretty small, give the crew incentives to sell products and then they split the profits with the airlines. 
"Products and merchandise must be small. The best item for low-costs is Pringles [potato chips]. They are small, 
with a long shelf life and high profit margins." He adds that marketing has made a big difference to revenues in the 
US, explaining that people will pay $10 for a pre-packaged meal branded, through a licensing agreement, by a 
famous chain such as the Hard Rock Café or TGI Fridays. Outside of creating greater ancillary revenues, other 
airlines are trying to increase value-added services for the passenger. ATA has announced an "Elite" Travel 
Programme. Song is introducing individual touchscreeen monitors for flights to the Bahamas. Advances in inflight 
entertainment technology have led several carriers to look at this, as systems get lighter and therefore less 
expensive. jetBlue already has backseat TVs, and others are planning to follow suit. But the key to success, says 
Cowen, must always be what the passenger wants. Some add-ons, such as allocated seating, cost airlines very 
little to implement; others, such as entertainment, must be key to a customer's preferences if the carrier is to justify 
the extra costs. Cowen says some airlines are risking their bottom line on an expense that will not bring them more 
passengers. "Beyond price, it is key to identify what else actively impacts a passenger in making their airline choice 
- not what is nice to have." He points to the fact that full-service carriers have lost market share to low-costs as 
proving that value-added services "are increasingly not valued by consumers, or at least not enough to justify the 
significant fare premiums that come with them". He adds that professionalism, service and friendliness of the crew 
are usually a very important factor in passenger satisfaction. "This does not cost more to engender but relies on 
selecting and training the right people in the first place." In other words, a well-run and well-managed airline will find 
it easy to attract customers without threatening low prices or low costs. As passengers become more aware of the 
competition on routes, they are likely to begin to calculate the cost of the entire trip, rather than just the ticket price. 
"This will certainly start to constrain Ryanair's ability to boost profits with ancillary charges," says Cowen. He also 
believes that Ryanair, which is one of the few low-costs to have stuck rigidly to its secondary airports policy, could 
start to lose passengers over this too. "Flying to city centre airports, whilst incurring higher airport charges, can be 
offset by a higher yield, particularly once the passenger factors in transfer charges, and additional time, from a more 
remote airport," says Cowen. 
 Airports get tired of discounts Airports - whether secondary or primary - are coming under intense scrutiny. As part 
of the trend to find competitive differentiators that boost profit, some low-costs and airports are starting to re-
examine ways of reducing airport costs. Several airports are working on developing low-cost terminals, which will 
How low can they go? 
cut out value-added services typically offered by airports and allow them to lower their costs, passing on the saving 
to the airline. This is particularly true at primary airports, which service both low-cost and full-service airlines. Dato 
Bashir Ahmad bin Abdul Majid, managing director of Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad, which operates Kuala 
Lumpur International Airport and houses Air Asia, explains: "We must decide as an airport if we want low-costs. The 
whole operation is completely different from traditional airlines, and airports were developed to meet the 
requirements of traditional airlines. "We made it very clear when Air Asia appeared that we would give no discounts, 
but that we would try to accommodate them. But we have to keep an eye on them all the time - they put up banners 
all over the place, and make the airport look like a supermarket. They also send me a letter every day arguing for 
discounts. They come up with a lot of compelling arguments, but as yet we have no compelling reasons why we 
should offer them discounts. Really, it is more convenient to get a separate terminal for them, and I think they would 
prefer it. It has been a very difficult experience, as we have had to change our mindset." The Civil Aviation Authority 
of Singapore is working on developing a specially designed low-cost terminal at Changi airport that will meet 
specific budget carrier requirements. Tan Sek Yong, assistant director of the proposed terminal, sees the low-costs 
as a boost for the airport - so long as they are kept apart from full-service airlines. But he adds that the CAA feels it 
is crucial that the terminal is available to all carriers which want it, and is not cross-subsidized. He also says that the 
airport is keen to cash in. It will not be putting seats by the departure gate, for example, but instead encouraging 
passengers to spend more time in the airport's retail areas, where there will be seats. Perhaps the most interesting 
development is at New York's JFK, where jetBlue has contracted Arup to design its own terminal. Elliot Wishlade, 
head of airport planning for Arup, says: "Airline investment has been directed at maximizing aircraft and crew 
usage, and minimizing passenger services. There has been a short planning horizon, with a minimum investment in 
fixed assets. Capital investment is focused, rather than on a lifecycle cost approach." The jetBlue terminal is 
designed to accommodate 20 million passengers a year. Its facilities, which are about one-third of the size of an 
average airline's airport space, include a single-class check in, which is smaller than usual, but with a longer 
queuing space. In fact there is just one queue, so the staff can easily mark the cut-off point for late passengers, and 
check on cabin baggage. jetBlue has low IT requirements, a small retail area focused on food, which does not 
interfere with the core business of getting passengers on aircraft, modest public space, and minimum sales and 
service provisions. Wishlade adds that air side has been an important factor too. "Low-costs will invest in air side, to 
get high turnarounds. The target at JFK is an average of 20 minutes. jetBlue wants high gate utilization, good 
ground servicing circulation and efficient taxi way circulation." In general, low-cost airlines want offices on or near 
the apron that, according to Air Asia, maximizes staff efficiency. They also want no aerobridges, escalators or 
travellators, and single storey buildings. However, not every airport can afford - or wants - to accommodate low-cost 
carriers. Ansgar Sickert, senior manager marketing and sales for Fraport, says that Frankfurt Airport could not 
consider setting up a low-cost terminal because of space restraints, among other reasons. He adds: "We are trying 
to attract those who bring most value, which are not low-cost carriers, who are extremely demanding and who don't 
want to pay for anything." Frankfurt Hahn, however, a secondary airport used primarily by Ryanair, and with low-
cost infrastructure in place, has been a success. "Aside from infrastructure, which we can change at Hahn but not 
at Frankfurt, the only things we can do is look at our services such as ground-handling charges and bussing, and 
reduce that to a minimum. We could also streamline our processes. The problem is that legacy carriers are under 
immense pressure and will also put the screws on airports and demand cheaper services too." Despite all these 
efforts to offer the best service at the lowest cost to see off rivals, Cowen believes the situation is not yet tough 
enough to see increased consolidation among low-cost carriers. "Growth rates will continue," he states, "especially 
in less-saturated markets. Recently I had to travel from Frankfurt to Gatwick one way, and the only way I could do 
this was by paying £380 on BA - between two of the biggest airports in Europe. There are still lots of opportunities 
in the main markets."

* Ryanair is expected to report a small increase in net profits for its second quarter, seasonally the most important 
three months of the year for generating earnings. The focus of attention, however, will be on the airline's updated 
forecasts for yields in the coming difficult winter season and on the impact of the surging oil price. Ryanair's fuel 
requirements are now unhedged, and Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive, has so far insisted that it makes 
little sense to be taking out any insurance policy with the oil price at current levels, on the basis that he expects the 
price to fall next year. The airline has refused to impose any fuel surcharges, but given the opaque nature of airline 
fare structures, it would be difficult to see whether the group has taken any action to raise fares to try to claw back 
any of the jump in its fuel bill. Overall, Ryanair has been pointing to a further likely decline in yields or average fare 
levels of between 10 and 20 per cent during the two winter quarters in the face of a continuing fierce price war on 
European short-haul routes. The consensus among analysts is for a small rise in second-quarter profits from 
Pounds 128m a year ago to between Pounds 130m and Pounds 140m, but the main issue could be how far this 
cushion will be eroded in the second half.
* Matalan, which last month revealed it was talking to a possible buyer for its lossmaking Lee Cooper jeans 
business, is expected to report half-year pre-tax profits of between Pounds 41m and Pounds 44.5m. The pre-close 
statement gave much of the important information about the period to August 28 - underlying sales up 4.5 per cent 
and gross margin down 20 basis points - so the focus will be on how the second half has begun. Trading across the 
sector has been very volatile, with huge swings in performance almost on a day-by-day basis. But anecdotal 
evidence suggests October was marginally better than September and analysts expect Matalan to have kept 
underlying sales at the same level as or slightly lower than the first half - between 3 and 4 per cent. But even if that 
is the case, the real crunch will be November, a month that has proved difficult for Matalan in the past.
WEDNESDAY
* Carphone Warehouse, Europe's largest mobile phone retailer, will update the market on its performance as it 
unveils results for the six months to the end of September. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 
27m on total sales of Pounds 1bn. The retailer is benefiting from tough competition between operators to win new 
subscribers and continued demand for the latest handsets with colour screens. But investors will also be looking for 
guidance on Carphone's likely performance over Christmas, its busiest sales period, as rival retailers have been

building up their stocks of phones. Investors will also be looking for an update on TalkTalk, Carphone's residential 
fixed-line business, which is taking on BT Group in the UK.
THURSDAY
* 3i Group's pre-close statement last month contained few surprises apart from the move by Michael Queen, 
finance director, to head the growth capital division. At this week's interims, investors will look at how management 
changes are bedding down, particularly progress made by Philip Yea, 3i's new chief executive. Another area of 
focus will be the possible impact of new and proposed accounting conventions. It follows an 18p downward 
restatement in 3i's net asset value for the period to March 2004 as a result of FRS 17, which deals with pensions. 
Some analysts believe such changes could lead to increased volatility in 3i's earnings to book value. One analyst 
forecasts NAV of 557p for the period to September, rising to 592p by the financial year-end. Attention will also focus 
on 3i's run rate of investment, and its level of divestments. However, it has already provided the market with figures 
for the first five months of the first half so few surprises are expected.
* Interim figures from Man Group, the world's largest listed hedge fund manager, have already been well flagged in 
a trading update in September. But in the meantime, bid rumours helped push the stock higher in October, and last 
week the net asset value of its AHL fund unexpectedly rose 4.2 per cent to its highest level since April. AHL had 
struggled for much of this year because of directionless equity and other markets. Man will report interim figures for 
the first time in dollars. Analysts expect profits before exceptionals of Dollars 311m (Pounds 170m) in the first six 
months, compared with Dollars 272m in the same period last year. Fully diluted earnings per share are seen at 85 
cents (76.1 cents), and the interim dividend at 23.1 cents (18.5 cents).

Irish low-cost carrier, Ryanair, today said it will offer in-flight entertainment packages to customers.
From today, the system will be available initially on five Stansted based aircraft and will be rolled out across the 
entire route network over the winter period.
The airline said it had acquired an APS inflight entertainment system, which will be trialled initially on five Stansted 
based aircraft from November and, if successful, will gradually be rolled out across the fleet by next March.
 The inflight entertainment will include a portable video player showing the latest movies and cartoons, sitcoms and 
audio CDs and will cost E7 or UK£5 for an initial trial period. APS portable video technology is one of the most 
advanced and easy to use entertainment systems in the world, Ryanair said in a statement today.

Diverting news for those in the travelling Brussels political circus who had been hoping to head to Rome on the 
cheap Ryanair flight to Ciampino airport, just south of the Italian capital.
The airport was closed ahead of the summit as a security measure, forcing Ryanair to detour to Pescara on the 
eastern coast.
From there, eurocrats and hangers-on were offered a scenic coach trip all the way across Italy - at their own 
expense. Curiously, some of them made other arrangements.

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's mercurial chief executive, yesterday said the airline had offered to pay Euros 4m 
(Pounds 2.8m) sought by the Belgian authorities in a state-aid case into an independently managed escrow 
account.
After swearing five months ago that Ryanair would never hand over a single euro, Mr O'Leary has kept up a 
barrage of abuse against the decision by the European Commission, announced in February, that various benefits 
Ryanair received at Charleroi airport, south of Brussels, had constituted illegal state aid.
But in the first sign of a concession, Mr O'Leary said the payment would be made pending the outcome of Ryanair's 
appeal against the Commission's decision to the European Court of First Instance.
Ryanair was still insisting yesterday that the Commission's decision was "flawed".
The airline said it was confident that the decision would be overturned as "it perverts fair and open competition, is 
highly damaging to the competitiveness of public regional and secondary airports, and will force consumers to pay 
higher fares at Charleroi to protect the high-cost (Brussels) Zaventem airport."
While Ryanair's battle is with the Commission, it is the Walloon regional government - with which Ryanair made its 
original deal at the state-owned Charleroi airport - that is having to pursue the repayment.
In recent weeks, the Walloon authorities have indicated they might take legal action against Ryanair in Dublin, if the 
airline continued to refuse to pay.
Yesterday, the airline said it had no desire to place the Walloon region "in a difficult position because of a legally 
flawed decision by the Commission".
Ryanair offer on state-aid fine: Low-cost airline chief offered to put Euros 4m demanded by Belgian authorities 
into escrow account pending appea
It had therefore agreed "under protest and without prejudice to the outcome of the appeal" to place the Euros 4m in 
an agreed interest-bearing escrow account until the European courts made a definitive decision.
"If Ryanair is successful in its appeal, these funds along with interest will be returned to Ryanair," said the airline. "If 
the appeal fails, Ryanair will agree that these funds will be transferred in their entirety to the region."
The airline has challenged one of the Commission's main conclusions, namely that no private airport operator 
would have granted the same advantages as Charleroi did, as "factually untrue and legally untenable".
But even if were to lose the appeal, it maintains there should be no repayment, as its Euros 40m costs of 
establishing and operating its Charleroi base "vastly exceeded" any discounts it had received, and the Commission 
decision allowed it to net off its costs against those of the regional government. Delta pilots deal, Page 28

Progress there remains ephemeral. * ExxonMobil - its integration of petrochemical and refining plants means it can 
capture even more of the upside. When times are good, they seem even better at ExxonMobil. * France Telecom -

TBI, the UK regional airports group, is acquiring the outstanding 28.6 per cent of London Luton airport for Pounds 
78m in cash and shares.
It is buying out the minority stake held by Alterra, a joint venture formed by Bechtel, the US engineering group, and 
Singapore Changi airport to invest in international airport ventures.
Keith Brooks, TBI chief executive, said the acquisition of 100 per cent control of Luton airport would allow the group 
for the first time to realise its potential as London's fourth airport and also to gain full access to its cash flows.
In addition to Luton, TBI owns Cardiff and Belfast International airports and Stockholm/Skavsta in Sweden. All four 
airports are highly dependent on the continued growth of the low-cost airline sector.
EasyJet has its headquarters at Luton while Ryanair, its Irish rival, has also announced plans recently to develop its 
presence at the airport with the launch of several new routes.
The airport handled 6.9m passengers in the year to the end of March.
TBI said that it was acquiring the Alterra stake in Luton for approximately Pounds 67m in cash and the issue of 
14.9m shares, representing 2.6 per cent of the enlarged capital, valued at Pounds 10.7m. The deal is conditional on 
approval by shareholders and certain financing conditions. The purchase will be financed from TBI's existing 
resources and new bank facilities.
The move would finally conclude TBI's efforts to acquire full control of Luton, which began in 1999 when it 
purchased an initial 25 per cent as part of its takeover of AGI. It is hoping that the airport can be developed to take 
advantage of the shortage of capacity in the south- east of England.
TBI said it expected the acquisition to dilute earnings "in the near term".
TBI was advised by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.

A late spurt takes the FTSE into the black, with Amvescap and Shell driving gains, but mining groups tumble on the 
shock hike in Chinese interest rates.
The Chinese central bank opted to raise rates by 0.27% taking the key rate to 5.58%. The much-feared measure 
raised concern in the mining sector that demand for commodities in China, which has underpinned the surge in 
demand for metals, could wane.
Xstrata (XTA) was the weakest blue chip with a dive of 59p to 839p. Antofagasta (ANTO) at 999p, BHP Billiton 
(BLT) 558p, Anglo American (AAL) £12.03 and Rio Tinto (RIO) £14.23p occupied the following four places on the 
Footsie loserboard with losses of between 21.5p and 45p.
The rate rise triggered fresh falls in oil prices in anticipation of lower demand for fuel from China.
US light crude for December delivery followed yesterdays 5% tumble with a fall of 74 cents at $51.74 a barrel, its 
lowest price in two weeks. London Brent crude shed 95 cents to $48.50 a barrel.
The FTSE 100 closed 13 points higher at 4,643, the FTSE 250 gained four points at 6,327 and the techMARK 
added five points at 1,139.
The FTSE Eurotop 300 rose six points to 1,001.
Meanwhile the Dow Jones was down three points at 9,999, recovering from an early low of 9,952. The S&P 500 
was flat at 1,126 and the Nasdaq was down a point at 1,969.
In London a survey from research company GFK Martin showed that consumer confidence during October 
remained relatively weak in comparison to recent years.
Amvescap was the top blue chip with a jump of 23.25p, or 8.4%, to 298.75p as the likes of Citigroup Smith Barney 
breathed a sigh of relief as the Anglo American investment groups dip in third-quarter profits and assets was no 
worse than expected.
Shell powered up 11.75p to 435.5p as analysts applauded its proposed unification plans and a promise of reforms

Deutsche Bank upgraded its rating on Shell from hold to buy while Finlay Macdonald, a fund manager at Britannic 
Asset Management, believes that the implications of the unified groups 100% inclusion in FTSE indices should 
create significant market demand for the shares.
Other oil groups were pegged back by a dip in oil prices, with BP at 529.5p and BG Group (BG.) 352.75p, down 6p 
and 3.5p respectively but fuel-dependent UK flag carrier British Airways (BAY) climbed 8p to 214.5p.
Budget airline Ryanair (RYA) gained 12 cents to 3.98 after confirming it will pay 4 million into an escrow account for 
the Walloon authorities in Belgium to boost services at Charleroi airport, ahead of the companys appeal against a 
European Commission ruling that it received illegal aid.
If Ryanairs appeal is successful, the funds along with interest will be returned to the company. Ryanair is due to 
unveil its second quarter results next Tuesday. Elsewhere Whitbread lost 20.5p to 810.5p as analysts expressed 
disappointment in its strategic review, which was accompanied with news of a 9.4% jump in first-half profit. Boots 
declined 8p to 663p as its numbers fell at the bottom end of expectations.
Among the mid-cap, iSoft trimmed 19p to 380p after a disappointing trading statement revealed that it is counting 
on a strong second half to the year after business in the first half met expectations.
Meanwhile Halma fell 7p to 159p after saying it was on course to meet full-year targets despite the fall in the dollar. 
Arbuthnot reiterated its hold advice in response to the news but highlighted the decline in growth at the group's core 
water and resistors operations.
Among the micro caps Formation Group (FRM), the integrated sports management and marketing business, surged 
by more than 23%, or 1.38p, to 7.25p after posting a widening in full-year profit. Retail Decisions (RTD), the card 
fraud prevention group, rocketed by nearly 18%, or 2.75p, to 18.25p on a forecast-beating trading update.
Shares in AIM-listed computer services group Glow Communications were suspended at 1pm today after rocketing 
by 68%, or 0.22p, to 0.535p.
The shares were suspended pending clarification of its financial position and contractual issues. Yesterday the 
group said it had abandoned plans to take the company private after failing to get sufficient support at its 
extraordinary general meeting. The group will make a further announcement on 4 November.

Body
Irish low-cost carrier, Ryanair, has agreed to repay E4m to the Walloon authorities over alleged subsidies for 
Charleroi Airport.
However, the monies will be placed in an escrow account until such time as an appeal is heard and the European 
Courts make a definitive decision on this matter, Ryanair said today.
If Ryanair is successful in its appeal, these funds along with interest will be returned to Ryanair. If the appeal fails, 
these funds will be transferred to the Belgian Region.
 In a detailed written response to the Walloon region, Ryanair said that costs of establishing and operating its base 
at Charleroi at E40M vastly exceeded any discounts received from the Walloon region, and the European 
Commission's decision entitles Ryanair to net our costs off against those of the Region. There is, therefore, no 
requirement for any repayment, the airline maintains.

It is strange how some parts of an industry can be mauled by market events while others sail serenely on. This is 
the case with air travel.
Most of the opportunities available to investors who want to take advantage of the boom in air travel are in the 
airlines themselves, struggling as always with vast excess capacity and predatory pricing.
Their highly volatile share prices show great sensitivity to small movements in fuel prices, ticket discounting and 
external events such as terrorism. British Airways, Easyjet and Ryanair, among others, are for that reason great 
stocks for short-term traders who can pit their wits against market expectations.
On the other hand there are just a few stocks in airport operators. The biggest of them, by far, is the UK's biggest 
airport operator, BAA, in which I bought shares for 526p on April 22 this year.
Even though they operate in the same industry, the differences between BAA and the airlines that use its facilities 
could hardly be greater.
The airline market seems to have few barriers to entry. I am always amazed that the glamour of the airline industry 
has attracted into it so many businessmen who made money elsewhere.
This long trail began with Freddy Laker and his Skytrain in the 1970s, continued with Sir Richard Branson (who 
made his first money in music) and his Virgin group and the steel stockholding fortune of the Blackburn-based 
Walker family that went into FlyBe.
While some of these ventures have done better than others, it is not a good sign for investors in any industry to see 
outside capital pouring into the creation of new competitors.
By contrast, setting up an airport from scratch is virtually impossible. Those like BAA that were in at the start have 
an unfair advantage. With Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted among its seven UK airports, BAA hardly has to worry 
about competition.
 It's no flight of fancy NICK LOUTH MY PORTFOLIO
This of course is recognised in its regulatory regime, which controls not only the charges it makes to airlines, but the 
return on its vast retail property empire, too.
Although BAA is a capital-hungry business, it gets a comfortable ride on the back of the low-cost airlines that have 
helped to fuel the growth of travel from airports such as Stansted and Luton.
This is reflected in the charges it is able to make. It has not gone unnoticed by travellers that it costs as much to 
travel on BAA's Heathrow Express rail link from London Paddington to Heathrow as it does to get from Stansted to 
France or Italy on a budget airline.
Since my April 22 purchase, the airline industry has suffered one of its perennial bouts of turbulence. Fuel prices 
have soared, and share prices have plummeted. British Airways and Ryanair are each down about 30 per cent 
while Easyjet is down 60 per cent.
Yet BAA is trading around 565p, 7 per cent higher than when I bought it six months ago.

Banks were among the heaviest fallers yesterday after a surprise rise in September retail sales sparked talk of the 
Bank of England being forced to raise interest rates higher than expected to curtail consumer spending.
John Butler, an economist at HSBC, said: "These retail sales figures should help to remind the Bank of England of 
the danger of signalling that rates have peaked."
HBOS fell 0.5 per cent to 734p, Northern Rock was off 0.3 per cent at 727p, Alliance & Leicester lost 0.6 per cent to 
870 1/2p, Barclays shed 0.9 per cent to 544p and Lloyds TSB was 0.3 per cent lower at 429p.
HSBC was also hit by Citigroup, which advised investors to switch into Standard Chartered because it is better 
placed to benefit from increasing business in Asia. Shares in HSBC fell 0.4 per cent to 885p, while Standard 
Chartered rose 0.2 per cent at 976p.
William Morrison Supermarkets led the FTSE 100 with a gain of 14.7 per cent to 222 3/4p on relief that it did not 
warn about full-year profits along with its interim results. Group trading performance was mixed, with strong like-for-
like sales growth in the core Morrisons business offset by a decline in sales at unconverted Safeway stores.
Analysts at CSFB said: "On the positive side, this statement did not contain any kind of profits warning, disposal 
proceeds have comfortably surpassed the company's expectation and the store conversion programme has been 
accelerated from three per week to four per week, which means it will now be complete by the end of 2005."
Mid-cap oil stocks were pushed higher by a combination of rising oil prices and reports in The Times of India that 
the state-owned Indian Oil Corporation was in the final stages of talks to buy a western European oil exploration 
and production company valued at Dollars 1bn that has operations in Africa.
Dealers said Burren Energy, up 5.7 per cent at 460 1/4p, was the most likely target since it has drilling operations in 
the Congo, Turkmenistan and Egypt, but Tullow Oil, 5.4 per cent better at 142 3/4p, also fitted the bill. Also in the 
sector, Paladin Resources added 5 per cent to 173p, Premier Oil put on 3.1 per cent at 637p and Dana Petroleum 
gained 3.1 per cent to close at 434 1/2p.
 Prospect of higher rates weighs on banking sector LONDON:
Other takeover speculation involved Easyjet. The budget airline rose 3.8 per cent to 131p on talk that rival Ryanair 
was planning a bid. Ryanair denied the rumour. A spokesman said: "It'll be a cold day in hell . . . it's not true." 
Shares in Ryanair were up 1.4 per cent at Euros 3.70.
JJB Sports also had a speculative spurt, rising 4.1 per cent to 211p on talk the sportswear retailer was back in play 
after bid talks with a private equity group, probably Cinven, collapsed earlier this month.
Kidde, the fire protection company, rose 17.4 per cent to 145p after it said it had rejected a bid offer that dealers 
said could be from Siemens or United Technologies. Gerrard, the broker, said that movements in the shares before 
the announcement should be investigated.
Royal Doulton, the china maker, was up 31.3 per cent at 11p on confirmation it was in bid talks with Waterford 
Wedgwood, down 29.8 per cent at Euros 6.25, on worries the company may have another rights issue to finance 
the deal.
AstraZeneca added 2 per cent to Pounds 22.18 after third-quarter earnings rose a better-than-expected 17 per 
cent. The pharmaceuticals company said it would take an Dollars 80m provision to write off excess inventories of 
Exanta, the anti-blood clotting drug that may now never get to market in the US following rejection by the Food and 
Drug Administration.

Highlight: Rumours Ryanair might bid to takeover rival easyJet took off this morning as shares in easyJet jumped.
Body
Rumours that Irish low-cost airline Ryanair might bid to take over rival easyJet took off this morning as shares in 
easyJet jumped.
The rumours appear to have started due to a putative fund raising at Ryanair, a possible signal that it is seeking to 
make an acquisition.
However, commenting on the rumours, a Ryanair spokeswoman said, "Hell will freeze over first."
 Shares in the British low-cost carrier rose 8.8pc on the news, climbing 11.5 pence to 142.5. The volume of shares 
traded rose to 28m, compared to daily average of 7m. Shares in Ryanair remained steady, edging 3 cent higher to 
377. Whether the regulator would allow any deal between the low-cost rivals is uncertain. A merger of the two 
companies would create a company worth uk£3bn, more than one-third bigger than British Airways. Last month 
Ryaniar chief executive Michael O'Leary announced a fares "bloodbath", as he aimed to knock up to 20pc of the 
airline's fares during the winter months.

Body
Since the turn of the century there has only been one reliable aspect of the air transport industry -- its 
unpredictability. But in airline terms, the sector seemingly oblivious to the turbulence created by terrorism, war, 
epidemics and economic malaise has been the low-fare carrier.
For many, at least in the short-haul arena, the low-cost model is dominating the agenda. Network carriers are 
radically restructuring their shorter-range offerings by slashing costs and simplifying the product in a bid to remain 
competitive and generate feed for higher yielding long-haul services. The aircraft manufacturers also are 
increasingly finding it is the low-fare carriers that are shopping for the mega-orders. An analysis of order backlogs 
conducted by AvSoft, a newly acquired aviation data provider within The Flight Group, shows there has been a 
significant swing towards large-scale sales to low-fare carriers over the past few years at the expense of orders 
previously placed by mainline airlines.
 
Modest presence
The presence of low-fare carriers in the latest Top 50 financial ranking of the world's airlines is modest, however. 
Produced by sister magazine Airline Business in conjunction with sister online information service Air Transport 
Intelligence, the ranking shows that, among carriers originally conceived as low-cost, only Southwest Airlines and 
EasyJet make the grade, although America West, which has transformed itself into a low-cost operator, can be 
added to this group.
New Order; The one constant in a turbulent air transport industry has been the growth of low-fare carriers. But 
can they continue to flourish? And can the major....
The passenger traffic ranking demonstrates more vividly the rise of low-fare carriers. Southwest is in the Top 10, 
while JetBlue Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair are comfortably among the Top 50.
EasyJet's performance is remarkable because it is the first start-up carrier in years to break into the Top 50 in 
revenue terms. Others will doubtless follow when the 2004 ranking is compiled next year. Ryanair, Air Berlin, 
JetBlue and Virgin Blue are all bubbling under the Top 50 and, with revenue growth between them averaging easily 
above 30%, all could enter next time.
But the low-fare carriers have not outperformed all others. The relentless march of Dubai's hub-building Emirates 
among network carriers matches the efforts of the low-fare players. Its performance since being created in 1985 is 
equally remarkable, and it is the first new player to break into the Top 25 listing for decades.
With revenue growth exceeding 35% last year, Emirates is the major mover up the ranking at the top end. The Top 
10 remained largely static, although Lufthansa leapfrogged FedEx Express, AMR/American Airlines and Japan 
Airlines to become the world's largest airline group in dollar terms. This picture will change again next year, with a 
combined Air France and KLM outpacing even the German flag carrier.
But financial analysts will point to profitability as something worth chasing, rather than revenue growth. While the 
latter encouragingly rose again last year, approaching the peak year of 2000, profits remain stubbornly low. The 
Top 50 carriers reported a miserly $1 billion in operating profit last year, a margin of just 0.4%. Although an 
improvement over a huge $10 billion loss in 2002, the combined net loss of $7.4 billion is still a grim result.
For many North American carriers, the struggle to improve these results will continue, according to a recent report 
by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO). Its blunt headline conclusion is that "legacy airlines must 
further reduce costs to restore profitability".
The GAO observes that "despite significant cost-saving initiatives and industry-wide traffic volumes approaching 
pre-11 September levels, legacy airlines continue to lose money". This group has failed to reduce costs sufficiently 
to be competitive with low-cost carriers. "Unit cost competitiveness is key to profitability," the GAO says.
 
Fallen revenue
"Carriers have cut costs, but the reduction is far short of what was needed after 9/11," says Chris Tarry of aviation 
consultancy CTAIRA. "The problem is that revenue has fallen as well, and there is a view that 40% of the US 
industry could be operating under Chapter 11 next year." Today, United is still under bankruptcy court protection, 
while US Airways returned there on 12 September.
This is US Airways' second entry into Chapter 11 this century -- it first filed for bankruptcy in August 2002. It 
emerged in record time in March 2003, but this time around, the shape of the carrier after restructuring could be 
radically different. Analysts talk of a possible asset sale by US Airways, or even liquidation. If that transpires, the 
ranking would lose a Top 15 player, easily making it the most significant loss since the demises of TWA, Ansett 
Australia, Swissair and Sabena.
Delta Air Lines is thought most at risk of joining US Airways in Chapter 11. The carrier's chief executive, Gerald 
Grinstein, has warned of a possible bankruptcy filing if substantial labour savings are not achieved. This is on top of 
a wide-ranging $1 billion cost-cutting initiative in early September, including up to 7,000 job losses.
Across the border, Air Canada left the Canadian equivalent of Chapter 11 on 30 September after 18 months' 
reorganisation.
For Tarry, the response of the European legacy carriers to the low-cost carrier threat has been faster than their 
American counterparts'. "The competitive response came very quickly. The challenge will be to continue to reduce 
costs," he says. In Europe, some legacy carriers are beginning to match and even exceed the financial 
performance of their low-fare rivals. Analysts forecast that British Airways, for instance, will produce a greater

operating margin than EasyJet in the current financial year, says Tarry. Aer Lingus is another that has turned its 
fortunes around, while others like Scandinavian Airlines are just beginning the transformation.
 
Pricing transparency
It is a transformation carriers have little choice but to make as the nature and expectations of travel changes. 
"There is a fundamental shift in what business and leisure passengers are prepared to pay," says Tarry. Increased 
pricing transparency, brought about by the rapid uptake of the internet allowing travellers to easily compare prices 
and schedules, has been a significant factor in driving fares down, believes the GAO.
Asia-Pacific carriers have not been immune to this effect, and the advance of internet ticket sales, in tandem with a 
boom in low-cost start-ups, is throwing down a major challenge to the region's legacy players. With significantly 
lower operating costs than their Western counterparts, however, coupled with them operating in faster growing 
economies, the profitability of this group has mostly been sustained.
This result has been achieved against the backdrop of a year that started with the SARS virus, which damaged 
traffic figures for the year overall, despite a snapback in travel as 2003 wore on. Traffic levels are recovering. The 
International Air Transport Association's latest figures put global international traffic growth for the January--August 
period this year at 8.4% over the 2000 mark. But the organisation warns that this recovery is "no excuse to relax".
"The increase in traffic is well beyond our expectations," says Giovanni Bisignani, IATA director general. "It will not 
mitigate the high cost of fuel, but it is certainly a much-needed shot in the arm for a beleaguered industry." The high 
fuel price is eating at the industry's cost gains, says Bisignani. IATA says the industry achieved a 2.5% cut in non-
fuel unit costs last year, and indications are for a further 3% cut for 2004, which is above expectations.
But this is unlikely to be enough this year to avoid the industry diving into the red, especially with oil prices 
continuing to spike above $50 a barrel. "Overall, we expect that the airline industry [domestic and international] will 
lose between $3 billion and $4 billion," says Bisignani. Tarry warns that there is a danger the loss could even 
continue next year.
For the aerospace manufacturing sector, the question is what the financial health or otherwise of their customers 
means for aircraft orders. As Tarry points out, rising traffic and increasing load factors are usually regarded as an 
indication that more capacity is required.
 
Profit=orders
"Plotting the operating result of the industry against order intake has until recently tended to support the contention 
that when airlines begin to make some money, the first thing that they do is to order new aircraft," says Tarry. Kent 
Fisher, vice-president future customer and market at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, agrees. "Once carriers become 
profitable, this translates into an order and delivery cycle," he says. Over the past year, it has been carriers in the 
Asia-Pacific, where there is robust economic and traffic growth -- in addition to low-cost operators -- that have been 
the most active in placing orders, he adds.
However, there are new factors at play. "Of late, this relationship appears to have broken down as ordering has 
been sustained while the industry overall has remained in loss," says Tarry. For Fisher, the dismal performance of 
the US majors may explain the discrepancy. "It's ironic, for at the aggregate level the industry lost over $6 billion in 
2003, but if you take out the four large North American carriers the industry was profitable. There were a lot of 
profitable carriers last year, as well as significant traffic growth, so the model is holding.
"We keep focused on the likelihood that over 75% of Boeing and Airbus deliveries in the next couple of years will be 
outside North America, where the industry is generally doing better," says Fisher.
 
New Order; The one constant in a turbulent air transport industry has been the growth of low-fare carriers. But 
can they continue to flourish? And can the major....
Rising backlogs
Looking at the largest carriers across the globe over the past two years, an analysis by AvSoft of aircraft numbers 
shows a slightly declining fleet size, while backlogs have risen. Network carriers have contributed to the increase in 
the backlog, as some begin renewing and expanding their fleets.
However, it is low-fare carriers that have been the main factor in changing the conventional relationship between 
the industry's financial health and order intake. "The distortion has arisen as a result of the orders placed by such 
carriers when they were the only customers likely to order and were able to exploit their position with particularly 
attractive prices," says Tarry.
In recent years, huge Airbus A320 family and Boeing 737 orders from EasyJet, JetBlue and Ryanair swamped 
virtually all other industry sectors for these types. Further large orders are soon to come from AirAsia and Air Berlin. 
"Low-cost carriers are now a significant portion of the backlog," says Fisher. So much so that the manufacturers 
take into account such carriers' requirements more than ever. "You just cannot ignore that kind of shift," says 
Fisher.
A look at order backlogs back to 2000 shows how significant low-fare carriers have become to the manufacturers. 
At the turn of the century, of the low-fare players only Southwest was in the top 10, with 87 aircraft on order. Delta 
topped the group with 163 units yet to be delivered. There were also significant outstanding orders from North 
American and European regionals.
By 2004, the picture could hardly be more different. Half of the carriers with the largest order backlogs are low-fare 
carriers, with JetBlue topping the list with 221 aircraft on order. By mid-year, another airline could be added to this 
number, with Independence Air being transformed from its former role as a United Express feeder to be an 
independent low-fare carrier operating from Washington Dulles.
Of the 2004 backlog list, only All Nippon Airways, Delta and Emirates among established carriers represented the 
legacy fraternity with a US Airways regional -- MidAtlantic Airways -- making up the balance. Since 2000, only Delta 
and Southwest have consistently been among the 10 carriers worldwide with the largest order backlogs.
But how will today's backlogs be financed? After the 2001 attacks, the mainstream banks pulled back from 
financing aircraft, with many suffering huge losses on aircraft that seem destined never to return from the desert. 
For the carriers that have wanted them, however, the ability to acquire new narrowbodies has generally not been 
hampered even during the depths of the crisis.
This is partly explained by the keenness of operating lessors, desperate to find customers as legacy carrier 
business dried up, to place aircraft wherever they could, says Bert van Leeuwen, senior vice-president, aviation 
industry research at Germany's DVB Bank, which specialises in transport finance. In addition, the popularity of 
sale/leaseback transactions has meant carriers can order an aircraft confident that they would secure a buyer when 
it was ready to be delivered.
"In reality even the weakest carrier can afford to fly brand-new A319s or Next Generation 737s," says van Leeuwen. 
"These are carriers that would not have the real financial strength to take new aircraft in a more balanced industry."
Moreover, the stronger low-fare carriers are in a powerful position to negotiate financing at attractive terms, says 
van Leeuwen. "As they see the legacy carriers suffer, banks eager to do business have jumped on the bandwagon 
and are willing to provide finance for the low-cost carriers."
Another factor in their favour is that low-cost carriers order popular aircraft types that have good liquidity, says van 
Leeuwen. That means they can be easily switched to another operator if the original one fails.
 
Liquidity matters
New Order; The one constant in a turbulent air transport industry has been the growth of low-fare carriers. But 
can they continue to flourish? And can the major....
"There have been so many aircraft parked in the desert for so long it has really opened financier's eyes to the 
importance of liquidity," says Fisher. Another important factor that improves liquidity is to have a standard aircraft, 
with as few special options as possible. This makes transferring it to another operator cheaper, says Tarry.
The key to an airline's ability to finance aircraft will always remain its profitability, says Fisher. As the industry 
recovers, financing will be available for carriers in the black. He is convinced that despite a reluctance of some 
banks to return to the market, there is "a tight correlation between demand for travel and the ability to obtain 
finance".
As this year's production-rate increases from Airbus and Boeing demonstrate, both are optimistic that order rates 
will pick up. Apart from North American carriers, which will trail the rest of the world, over the coming years the 
order outlook for orders is brightening. Boeing expects to see airlines in almost every region taking advantage of 
market growth and expanding capacity, says Fisher.

European pilots' unionsare joining forces to challenge the management of Ryanair, the Irish low-cost airline, and 
Michael O'Leary, its fiercely anti-union chief executive.
The airline's response to previous attempts by the unions to achieve recognition was summed up in a letter sent to 
staff this year by Warwick Brady, its director of flight operations at Stansted. "We have no objection to any Ryanair 
pilot joining Balpa (the British Airline Pilots Association), the Taliban, the Monster Raving Loonies or indeed the 
Moonies," he said. "Each individual is perfectly free to join whatever organisation he/she chooses.
"Balpa, in return for your membership, will charge you 1 per cent of your total salary, a sum that will amount to up to 
Pounds 1,000 - yes Pounds 1,000 - each year. If you want to waste Pounds 1,000 we recommend fast women, 
slow horses or even greyhound racing, at least you'll have a few minutes of fun, which is more than you'll have with 
Balpa."
The Ryanair European Pilots Association has been formed by the British and Irish pilots' unions to give "a united 
voice and representation" in their dealings with the company.
The Ryanair chief executive has consistently resisted recognising any unions for the airline's 2,500 workforce, 
which includes about 600 pilots.
The pilots' union remains cautious about any early move to mount another ballot for recognition, after failing by a 
wide margin in 2001 to win bargaining rights for the airline's UK-based pilots at its Stansted, Prestwick and Luton 
airport bases.
Jim McAuslan, Balpa general secretary, ruled out making such a move this year. "We hope that Ryanair 
management will recognise the value to the business of having a means to provide an outlet for the view of the 
employees."

Ryanair, the airline with the highest profit margin in Europe, is the only significant carrier operating out of the UK 
where Balpa does not have negotiating rights. The union has won recognition deals at both EasyJet and at Virgin 
Atlantic in recent years.

Aer Lingus to seek E2-300m from govt?

Body
Aer Lingus is to ask the government for a cash injection of 200-300m euro to fund new planes, according to a report 
this morning.
It will need the money to make initial payments on a fleet of long haul jets whose acquisition it is currently 
negotiating.
The request for money will be made "shortly", the Irish Times reports without quoting sources.
 The airline's management recently withdrew a request to develop an investment mechanism to fund the new 
purchases , at the same time ruling out a management buyout for the company. Taoiseach Bertie Ahern also said 
that a management buyout would not accord with the airline's mandate. Apparently based on a confidential briefing, 
this morning's report says Aer Lingus is currently in advanced negotiations with both Boeing or Airbus for new 
planes and a deal "could be completed within four to eight weeks". It says formal offers have been submitted by 
both companies and the funding question will soon become an urgent matter for the Cabinet. The airline needs 
about 10 or 11 new aircraft to renew its long-haul fleet. It believes it can secure a good deal in the current 
environment with Boeing and Airbus locked in fierce competition to build up their order books, especially in Europe. 
The paper says the airline expects to lease half the new aircraft and purchase the others outright. Based on list 
prices, the total cost would be about USD1.2 billion. However, with half the planes leased and the bought aircraft 
coming on stream on a phased basis, the airline does not require that scale of funding. Boeing is offering its 
planned 7E7 airliner, while Airbus is offering a mix of A330s, A340s and the new A350, it says. The new planes 
would allow Aer Lingus for the first time to fly to destinations like South-East Asia, the Middle East and South Africa. 
In a related development, Aer Lingus received 1,629 expressions of interest from staff for the 1,325 redundancies it 
wants. Within this, however, there were only 58 expressions of interest from the catering section, where it wants to 
shed 223 jobs. In other airline news, Ryanair pilots are expected this week to formally launch a new trade union to

represent it with the airline. The Ryanair European Pilots' Association has been formed with the held of the British 
and Irish unions BALPA and IAPLA.

Highlight: Ryanair pilots have formed a single association, Ryanair European Pilots Association, to represent

Body
Ryanair pilots across Europe have formed a single association, Ryanair European Pilots Association (REPA), to 
represent them.
The new body was launched today in Dublin and London by the two largest pilot organisations in Ryanair, the 
British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA) and the Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA).
The association said it plans give pilots a united voice and representation in their dealings with Ryanair and in 
particular with the airline's CEO Michael O'Leary.
 Captain Mervyn Granshaw, Chairman of BALPA said the new association will help pilots on a number of levels. 
"For the individual pilot it will be a place to bring issues and concerns and get feedback. For the Ryanair pilot 
community it will be a place to share experiences and develop views on how the company can be a more 
successful and rewarding place to work," he said. IALPA President Evan Cullen said Members from Ireland, the 
UK, Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, and Germany will decide what points they want raised with management, with 
the regulators, and with politicians.

the Spanish flag- carrier, to take it to court over what it alleges are unfair deals with regional authorities in Spain.
"Iberia is just another high-fares airline which has been ripping off Spanish consumers for years," said Jim 
Callaghan, head of regulatory affairs at the Dublin-based airline.
His comments came in response to those of Angel Mullor, chief executive of Iberia, who said the company was 
"compiling information" about Ryanair's activities at several airports around Spain.
The Dublin-based budget carrier flies to 11 destinations in the country, and uses Girona, north of Barcelona, as a 
hub for 18 further routes across Europe.
Ryanair has used subsidies from local authorities with under-utilised airports to keep fares down for its 24m 
passengers. It cut-price, no- frills strategy has brought it into conflict with numerous European carriers.
The company is currently appealing a recent ruling by the European Commission that it pay back an estimated 
Euros 3m (Dollars 3.7m) in subsidies from the Walloon region in Belgium. Last year a French court ruled that the 
airline had received illegal subsidies from a local chamber of commerce for setting up a route between Strasbourg 
and London.
It is understood Iberia is focusing its investigation on incentives used by the regional Catalan government to 
generate tourist traffic at Girona. It also hopes to build a case against other, locally-based cut-price operators in 
northern Spain. "As soon as we have the minimum information needed for the case (against Iberia) to be admitted, 
we will present it," Mr Mullor said during a visit to Central America.
Ryanair countered it "pays the standard published charges at all Spanish airports served by the company". "The 
marketing agreements that Ryanair has with Spanish authorities are non-exclusive and available to any airline, 
Iberia probes 'unfair' Ryanair deals SPAIN :
including Iberia, who wish to develop and deliver the same international routes and passenger numbers as Ryanair 
is delivering," Mr Callaghan said.
* Iberia confirmed it was willing to sell its 18 per cent stake in Amadeus, an IT and distribution company for the 
travel industry, "as long as the price is right". At least six private equity groups are known to be looking at the 
company, in which Air France has a 23 per cent holding and Lufthansa, 5 per cent.

Eircom's chairman has indicated that the company may be willing to buy Meteor as a way of entering the mobile 
phone market.
Sir Anthony O'Reilly said such a purchase was one option, but that his company was also examining alternatives.
Speaking after Eircom's agm in Dublin yesterday, he said the company would have a clear strategy by early next 
year on how it will enter the mobile market.
 "This ain't the long-finger exercise," he said.. If Meteor's owners were realistic and prepared to see that a joint 
investment could increase its current market share from 3 pc towards 20 pc, he said, then a deal could be done 
which would benefit everyone, including consumers. He added that Eircom's balance sheet could afford to make an 
acquisition in mobile, while still remaining a "solid stock with a decent dividend". Referring to the alternative option 
of Eircom becoming a virtual mobile operator by using another company's network, Sir Anthony said the current 
regulatory regime was "very unfair". While Eircom was obliged to open its landline network to competitors at cost, it 
did not get access to other company's networks on similar terms. Eircom chief executive Mr Phil Nolan said he 
believed that the telecoms regulator had the power to introduce changes to the market which would be "extremely 
helpful to Eircom," in its desire to re-enter the mobile market. A consultation process with the regulator is due to 
come to fruition in November, he said, and the company felt this would help clarify its options. Eircom would not 
decide on the best way back to mobile until after the regulatory review, he said. Sir Anthony O'Reilly added that if 
Eircom could get access to a mobile network at a reasonable price "we will give you the Ryanair of mobiles".

Tui, the German travel group, is expanding Thomsonfly.com, its UK low-cost scheduled airline, with the launch of a 
third operating base at Bournemouth on the south coast of England.
The plan is the latest move by Europe's biggest travel concern in a restructuring drive that is aimed to cope with 
fierce competition and changes in the way consumers plan and buy holidays.
Holidaymakers have been deserting traditional package holidays in favour of greater independence in making travel 
arrangements.
The inclusive tour operators have been losing market share in particular to the fast-growing low-cost airlines led by 
Ryanair and EasyJet and to online travel agencies.
In response, Tui has launched two low-cost scheduled airline operations in its main markets: Hapag-Lloyd Express 
in Germany with bases at Cologne/Bonn, Hanover and Stuttgart; and Thomsonfly.com in the UK, which started 
flying from Coventry airport in March.
Thomsonfly.com is opening two more UK bases next spring, at Bournemouth and at Doncaster Sheffield, the former 
Finningley RAF base near Doncaster, Yorkshire.
Alex Hunter, chief commercial officer of Thomson-fly.com, said yesterday that the group would start services from 
Bournemouth in mid-March 2005 to a number of European beach, leisure and city destinations.
The airport is already used by Ryanair for three services to Dublin, Barcelona/Gerona and Glasgow Prestwick, with 
the Irish carrier accounting for about 60 per cent of this year's forecast passenger volumes of 500,000.
Bournemouth, part of the Manchester Airport Group, originally attracted its first low-cost airline in late 2002 when 
Buzz decided to open a second UK base there. But the move was abandoned a few months later when Buzz was 
taken over by Ryanair.

Mr Hunter said that Thomsonfly.com would base two 148-seat Boeing 737-300s at Bournemouth in addition to three 
737-300s it would operate from Doncaster.

Budget carrier Ryanair today said the proposed building of a new runway at Dublin Airport was a waste of money.
The comments come after Dublin Airport this morning said it had lodged a planning application for a new runway 
with an estimated cost of around E130m to cope with an expected growth in passenger traffic of 20m passengers 
per year in five year's time.
Ryanair's deputy chief executive, Michael Cawley today said that the airport doesn't need another "Cartier" runway 
when the UK's Stansted, which copes with 19m passengers a year and Gatwick, with 30m passengers, each have 
just one main runway.
 "What Dublin airport urgently needs, and what customer airlines and the entire tourism and hospitality sector are 
calling for, is the Government to immediately proceed with developing independent competing terminals, so that 
Irish consumers and visitors don't have to endure the third world third rate facilities that currently exist at Dublin 
Airport," he said.

Irish budget carrier, Ryanair, today said it will operate nine new international routes from its London, Luton hub.
The airline said the first flight from Luton to Dinard in France began today and plans to phase-in the remaining eight

It said the occasion was also marked with the arrival of the first of four brand new Boeing 737-800's, which has

Ryanair will be competing directly with its main European rival, EasyJet, from Luton.
 "For consumers, our expansion at Luton means four brand new Boeing aircraft and a total of eleven low fare

Patrick Barwise is Professor of Management and Marketing at London Business School. Sean Meehan is Martin 
Hilti Professor of Marketing and Change Management at IMD.
For many companies, innovation has veered off track as managers obsess over clever branding, unique product 
features and "thinking out of the box". Instead, business should focus on giving customers what they really want 
Genuine customer-focused innovation is more rare than one might expect. In the words of business historian 
Morgen Witzel: "I grow very tired of people not only reinventing the wheel, but making it square because this is a 
new and exciting feature. The 'new' business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce model was usually just Montgomery 
Ward's mail order catalogue reinvented and badly executed." In many companies, innovation is off track because 
executives are obsessed with unique product features, overly complex market segmentation, clever branding and 
"thinking outside the box". Innovation becomes the pursuit of novelty and excitement instead of what it should be - 
relentless improvement in giving customers what they want. What customers really want, and are still not getting, is 
steadfast delivery of the basics - that is, products that actually work and reliable services that take place on time. 
Thus, businesses have a huge opportunity: they should focus their innovation at being "simply better" than their 
competitors at providing the basics or the generic category benefits that really matter to customers.
The category benefits are what most customers want from any provider in a market. By dismissing them as mere 
"table stakes", most companies wrongly assume that they have no role in brand choice, except as simple zero-one 
qualifiers - a set of boxes to be ticked. The evidence, however, is that the basics matter far more than any unique 
brand differentiators, and that successful companies such as Tesco, Toyota, Orange and Progressive Insurance 
prioritise them and seek to improve their performance on them continuously. This approach then provides a solid 
platform for an established brand to introduce new lines, new forms and even extensions into new categories, so 
long as they meet and reinforce positive consumer expectations. Consider the remarkable success of Tesco, the 
UK grocer, in a ferociously competitive market where imitation might appear to be both quick and easy. As recently 
as the early 1990s, J. Sainsbury was the clear market leader, far ahead on customer service, quality and 
innovation. Tesco, meanwhile, was losing volume from its core price-conscious customer base, reinforcing its 
image as a cheap, slightly tacky and failing store. By the end of the decade, the positions were reversed. Tesco had 
increased sales by 250 per cent to œ18.8bn, and grown its market share to 16 per cent, beating Sainsbury into 
second place. Since then, the gap has widened even further. What happened in the intervening years? Tesco 
learned to be "simply better" than the competition. It reviewed its position, realised some home truths and made a 
The benefits of getting the basics right
monumental effort to find out and then provide what customers really wanted, using the slogan: "Every little helps". 
In other words, it rediscovered the category benefits - the basics shoppers expected and demanded of all grocery 
stores - and delivered those benefits more effectively than anyone else. It was not rocket science but it was 
innovative. More importantly, it was innovation focused on providing extra customer benefits, however small.
The realisation that being simply better is the key driver of business success and a platform for customer-focused 
innovation also helps to explain the outcome of the contest between Orange and One2One, the UK mobile 
telephone operators, in the early 1990s. The government had awarded two identical digital licences to each 
company. Both were backed by large, well- capitalised public companies. Both had access to the same technology. 
This was a level playing field. As it happens, each operator was sold within six months of one another about ten 
years after being created: Orange for Pounds 20bn and One2One for Pounds 6.9bn. Why the huge difference in 
shareholder value creation? A closer look at the choices made by the two management teams is revealing.
Orange asked: "What do most mobile phone customers want but do not get most of the time?" It found that they 
had negative opinions about many basic aspects of their service providers including cost and network reliability. 
Orange differentiated with a promise to provide a reliable service but also per second billing, a simpler tariff, caller 
ID, a money-back guarantee if the service failed and free itemised billing - unique features but, more importantly, 
highly relevant generic category benefits. All would be copied within months, but by then Orange had established 
itself as a company that cared about customers. But Orange was not static, either. Year after year it came to the 
market with more simple common sense features (see table 1). These post-launch innovations all represented 
market firsts. They would ensure that Orange would continue to lead the category in providing the generic category 
benefits - that is, deliver the most reliable and high-quality overall customer experience with fair value for money. 
Continuously innovating on dimensions that really matter contributed to the company carving out its position in the 
UK market as "the most personable telecommunications company in the world". Most of these features were not 
high-tech; they were simple, utilitarian augmentations of the wireless offering and they all left Orange open to 
competitive retaliation.
The lesson is that customer-focused innovation should aim primarily at relentless improvement in the quality and 
reliability of the generic category benefits. New lines, new features and new methods are judged mainly on whether 
they really address the benefits wanted by most prospective customers. As Theodore Levitt, the management 
writer, succinctly put it: "Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things." Consider Tesco's 
renaissance. It was the result of a combination of expanding into non- food items, introducing new formats, making 
successful acquisitions and pricing competitively. With the saturation of superstores, Tesco realised that new 
growth had to come from more innovative concepts. Hence, it introduced new formats of smaller and mid-size city 
centre stores - Tesco Metro and Tesco Express respectively. The company positioned itself as a good-value retailer 
for all shoppers, avoiding a market segmentation route which can often be another marketing blind alley. In the 
1990s, Tesco studied what Sainsbury was doing well and, using that as a benchmark, innovated relentlessly to beat 
it at its own game. Even when Tesco developed its online offer, it always saw it as just another way to provide the 
category benefits to its customers. In just three years, Tesco.com and its home delivery service has grown to cover 
95 per cent of the UK and with 70,000 orders per week, it has annual sales of over œ300m, about 10 per cent of all 
online retail commerce in the UK. It is the largest online grocer in the world and it makes money.
Focusing innovation on what really matters If business fortunes lie in delivering generic category benefits better 
than the competition then, as business managers, can we identify the right benefits demanded by customers? 
Above all, we must spend a lot of time directly with customers. Many companies have customer contact 
programmes. Our research reveals how and why some are ineffective. In one study, we compared the time 
allocation of CEOs of 100 high-performing companies and 100 low-performing companies. The results showed that 
the high fliers spent 18 per cent of their time with customers, while the stragglers spent 15 per cent of their time on 
interaction - hardly a significant difference. What was different, however, was the way these CEOs spent their 
customer time. The poor performers focused on socialising at cultural or sporting events - not an ideal context for 
generating meaningful discussions. The high performers preferred to get down to business at the customer's office 
and focus on whether their companies were living up to the promise and expectations. They were persistently 
The benefits of getting the basics right
curious about how they could improve their product or service offering relative to the competition, in ways that 
mattered to customers.
A related approach is to explore ways in which the whole industry - your own company and its competitors - could 
improve. Cemex, the Mexican cement giant, grew from a regional player to a world leader by concentrating on basic 
category needs, not on nice-to-have extras. The company looked at where other ready-mix suppliers were failing. 
Since 1995, it has guaranteed its customers same-day delivery within 20 minutes of schedule in designated 
geographic markets, regardless of weather conditions - including in traffic- jammed Mexico City. Cemex can make 
these deliveries by using satellite and web-based vehicle dispatch technology. Not only did this system increase 
truck productivity by 35 per cent, it wedded customers firmly to the brand. Similarly, when Daewoo Motors achieved 
an unprecedented 1 per cent UK market share in three years, it did so by first asking customers what they really 
hated, not about a particular brand or even about cars in general, but about the experience of buying and owning a 
car. They heard thousands of horror stories, which not only enabled them to develop a great service package but 
also helped them to generate positive publicity and a database of qualified prospects.
One of the lessons from these and other companies is that innovators should focus on those needs that customers 
know they have but that are still unmet, either because they have not been identified by the companies in the 
market or because the companies have failed to address them satisfactorily. Too much focus on how a brand or 
business is performing against the competition at delivering the benefits already identified by the industry is a 
common mistake. It results in missing the opportunity to steal a march on the competition by broadening the basics 
- that is, by providing (better than the competition) an important previously unidentified or insufficiently met category 
benefit. Experimentation and clarity Innovation, experimentation and pushing the frontiers of product or service 
delivery is always a seductive idea. The simply better organisation avoids experimentation for experimentation's 
sake and knows that when an experiment fails, it is usually time to can the project before too much money is 
wasted. Progressive Insurance is an avid innovator and a ruthless killer of dud projects. The company designed a 
business system that enabled it to make money from insuring "high-risk" (in their terminology "non- standard") 
drivers: people who typically had a poor safety record; did not speak English as a first language; drove high-
performance vehicles; or were either over 65 years or young, first-time drivers. The system turned out to deliver a 
value proposition with mass-market appeal. Consequently, Progressive became the fourth largest auto insurer in 
the US.
Progressive's innovative thinking goes back to 1956 and the realisation that 20 per cent of drivers fell into the non-
standard category. But this group was difficult to service profitably. By investing heavily in data-capture technology 
and analytical tools, the company developed a highly accurate underwriting system and so was able to assess risk 
and set prices more keenly. By increasing claims handling efficiency, making loss adjusters available 24 hours a 
day and revising managers' incentives, Progressive created an offering that appealed to customers and was 
lucrative for the company. Progressive's founder Peter Lewis was obsessed with allowing executives "the freedom 
to experiment, to figure out how we could become better". Additionally, anything Progressive did had to be good for 
customers, otherwise there was no point. This approach paved the way for new technologies and a highly 
responsive culture. In 2000, the company introduced Autograph, an adaptation of GPS technology, which allowed 
premiums to be based on the amount, location and timing of car use. Innovative though this was in terms of pricing 
accuracy, the project was dropped when the technology and resulting systems proved too complex and the reliance 
on a third-party technology provider was deemed too risky. In March of that year, Progressive also discontinued its 
home insurance project. It concluded that becoming involved in the sector might compromise its competitive 
advantage, namely the smooth interaction with agents who would have had to spend far more time visiting home 
policy customers than auto customers.
First in... losing out Executives should also beware the buzz around "latent needs". Ever since Ralph Waldo 
Emerson's infamous "Better Mousetrap", and doubtless long before, we have had no shortage of business ideas 
that cropped up "before their time". They fail mainly because the alleged latent needs turn out to be so trivial, or to 
apply to so few customers, that the resulting market opportunity is minimal or non-existent - there is no potential 
new category. At the same time, executives should not be spooked by the fear of losing the opportunity to be the 
first mover. As Gerard J. Tellis and Peter N. Golder have pointed out, sustainable advantage typically accrues to 
The benefits of getting the basics right
the second or third entrant with the vision, courage and capital to create or redefine a category. Thus, JVC, the 
electronics maker, did not pioneer the market in VCRs but it did create the mass-market category by focusing on 
innovation to meet and exceed real needs and expectations at an affordable price. Large organisations should 
scrutinise the smaller and more innovative competitors who are generally unburdened by decades of narrow legacy 
thinking. It is the alert, well-capitalised, simply better second movers, not the original pioneers, that usually gain 
most from radical innovation. The internet provides many examples of companies who fell in love with the 
technology and forgot about customers' real needs. As John Browett, CEO of Tesco.com, commented: "First mover 
advantage has two parts to it: being first and getting it right. There are loads of examples where people forgot the 
second bit." With hindsight, we can see that so many defunct dotcoms were doomed because they failed to develop 
value propositions relevant to customers. In contrast, a handful that used technology well survived to become major 
brands by delivering what customers wanted - Amazon, Yahoo, Google and eBay spring to mind. All of these are 
simply better companies with outstanding attention to detail in execution. Meanwhile, most of the success stories of 
the internet boom have been companies such as Dell, Ryanair, easyJet and Tesco who were already selling direct 
through traditional channels. Create customer value proposition Understanding what customers want cannot be 
stressed too strongly. Equally important is the need to articulate the value proposition in a way that allows 
innovation to focus on improving customer value.
Take the case of low-cost airlines. It would be easy to think of them as radical rule breakers but they were not. 
Rather, they developed a business model that delivered a lot of customer value. Cheaper fares with no frills but 
industry-standard safety and reliability were a category benefit that allowed leisure travellers much more scope and 
business travellers a cost-effective alternative to the national carriers. Low-cost airlines continue to drive the 
market, although they are currently suffering from the overcapacity created by recent imitators. At one point in 2003, 
Ryanair was the most valuable airline in Europe, with a market capitalisation of Dollars 6.7bn. The carrier attracts 
customer complaints to the point of derision - hence its Irish nickname "Eireoflot". If a delay occurs, the company 
does not provide food or accommodation. Despite this apparent lack of customer focus, however, the airline 
remains highly popular. As CEO Michael O'Leary explains: "Our customer service proposition is about the most 
well-defined in the world. We guarantee to give you the lowest airfare. You get a safe flight. You get a normally on-
time flight. That's the package. We don't and won't give you anything more on top of that.... We care for our 
customers in the most fundamental way possible: we don't screw them every time they fly." The key point here is 
that Ryanair may be one of the most complained about airlines but the complaints are not about a failure to deliver 
on its value proposition. Ryanair is courageous, not reckless.

adding to morning gains and closing up 5c at 595. Rival Abbey was also one of the session's few good performers, 
rising 14c to 870. Heiton rose 2c to 672. Elsewhere, profit takers hit Elan hard after investors initially pushed the 
stock up. Shares slid 101c to 1766. Budget carrier Ryanair remained out of favour, with shares down 10c at 371.

Shares in Ryanair have been hit hard as investors grow nervous about the fact that the low-cost airline isheading 
into the winter with its fuel requirements unhedged beyond the end of this month.
Europe's leading low-cost carrier is in a more exposed position on fuel than any of the leading European airlines.
Ryanair's share price has declined by 5.4 per cent in the past two days, the biggest faller among European aviation 
stocks.
Last night its shares closed 11 cents, or 2.8 per cent lower, at Euros 3.87. Brent crude oil futures have risen sharply 
in the past two days, hitting a record Dollars 48.02 a barrel yesterday.
Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein downgraded its forecast for Ryanair earnings by 4 per cent for the next financial 
year to March 2006, even after factoring in renewed cost-cutting efforts by the airline.
Goldman Sachs issued a warning across the whole of the European airline sector and said "get out quick to avoid 
the oil slick . . .oil remains stubbornly high, meaning 2005 is likely to be another lost year".
"The recent share price strength cannot be reconciled with the still high oil forward curve. If the curve is right, the 
sector could nosedive again," said Goldman.
It said the industry "is not built for Dollars 30 oil let alone Dollars 50". It cut its 2005-06 earnings estimates for 
European airlines by between 25 and 64 per cent with Ryanair at the lower end.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, has remained relatively sanguine, believing that whatever blows hit Ryanair, they 
will be softened by its as yet still very healthy profit margins.
"It is in our interests for oil prices to go higher - it will take out our competitors," he said recently. "If it doubles, we 
are going to see the end of a lot of lossmaking airlines. If it doubles, we will still be squeaking a profit."
Ryanair hit by fears over fuel hedging TRANSPORT:
Mr O'Leary said he believed that oil prices would fall in the medium term and that it would be "unwise" to hedge at 
the current high rates. Higher oil prices could largely be offset by cost savings in other areas in the current financial 
year, he said.
Ryanair's position of being completely unhedged compares with British Airways being hedged 72 per cent for the 
year to March and 30 per cent for the first nine months of the next financial year, rather below the levels chosen by 
Lufthansa and Air France.
If oil prices stay high, hedging only delays the impact, however, and Goldman estimates that most carriers will see a 
35 to 40 per cent rise in fuel costs per available seat kilometre from 2003 to 2005. Fuel costs account for about 15 
per cent of total operating costs for airlines.

Body
Irish budget carrier, Ryanair, today said it plans to triple the size of its Boeing 737-800 fleet within ten years.
Ryanair chief, Michael O'Leary, today said the company would, "only compete in those markets where we can fill 
737-800s and the smaller markets we will leave to somebody else, and the bigger markets we will leave to 
somebody else".
O'Leary said he "welcomes" the subsidies row between Airbus and Boeing, after the US decided to file a formal 
case with the WTO alleging that the EU gives unfair state aid to the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co 
NV unit.
 "The more they're fighting the more they're competing against each other. The more there's competition between 
Airbus and Boeing, the better it is for airlines and the better for passengers," he said. Last year more than 10pc of 
Ryanair's total costs went towards air traffic control, he said. "It's an enormous figure. The equivalent number in the 
US is zero, they don't pay for the service in the US," he said.

Body
A group of European low-cost airlines yesterday wrote to the European Commission arguing that the terms of the 
debt restructuring offered to Alitalia, Italy's troubled flagship airline, amount to illegal state aid.
The European low fares airlines association (ELFAA), which groups 11 airlines including Ryanair, Air Berlin, Wizz 
Air and Volareweb, threatened to challenge the deal, complaining that "the shift of Alitalia's existing Euros 1.6bn 
(Dollars 1.97bn) debt to the AZ Service unit is unambiguous. Asymmetrical distribution of the original company's 
liabilities would be tantamount to illegal state aid."
Their letter, sent to Loyola de Palacio, the EU's transport commissioner, and Mario Monti, competition 
commissioner, also warned that "any form of state aid to Alitalia will be subject to an official challenge".
A person close to the group said this would probably mean court action if the EU executive failed to endorse their 
concerns.
Italy's centre-right government was due to meet Alitalia management and trade unions last night in what one 
minister suggested could be the decisive round of talks for giving the go-ahead to the airline's rescue plan.
The unions have accepted that about 3,700 workers, or about one-sixth of Alitalia's staff, will lose their jobs, but 
want firm guarantees from the government and management of financial support for the laid-off workers.
The unions succeeded last month in securing a promise from Giancarlo Cimoli, Alitalia chief executive, that, once 
the airline is split in two, the Italian state will retain a strong presence in AZ Service - the maintenance and ground 
service unit. Mr Cimoli wants AZ Fly - the flight operations arm - to benefit from a recapitalisation early next year of 
up to Euros 2bn, but has not specified what will happen to Alitalia's debt, which amounted to Euros 1.63bn at the 
end of August.
Rivals attack Alitalia revamp AVIATION:
Alitalia must repay an emergency Euros 400m loan, which has been guaranteed by the Italian government, within 
six months at the earliest. Its financial condition is also affected by losses that it says will amount to Euros 400m 
this year.
British Airways and a number of other airlines have also raised concerns about the plan agreed to save Alitalia, but 
the European Commission has so far refrained from commenting until it receives official notification of the Alitalia 
plan from the Italian government, expected by the end of the week.

Record oil prices continued to concern jittery European markets, while an improved profit forecast at Volkswagen 
saw the German motoring giant leap more than 5%.
US light crude prices initially rose to $51.48 a barrel but eventually fell back to $50.95, down 19 cents on the day.
Anticipated oil price rises were also fuelled by the threat of a strike by Nigerian oil workers, which could start as 
early as next Sunday.
Oil price fears hit both British Airways and German airline, Lufthansa, as the prospects of increased fuel costs 
continued. Europe's largest low-fare carrier, Ryanair was also hit by oil fears dropping nearly 2% to 3.91 a share.
However, Alitalia, Italy's largest airline bucked the trend climbing nearly 4% on the back of news that it had 
brokered an agreement with its labour unions to cut 3,700 jobs.
Energy giants BP and France's Total, both enjoyed strong starts to the day, both up around 1%.
At 3.30pm Germany's DAX was unchanged on the day at 4,048.90, while France's CAC 40 slipped by more than 8 
points at 3,762.17. The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 Index fell 0.1 percent to 244.04 as of 3:10 pm in London.
Volkswagen was a rare bright spot on an otherwise uninspiring day, rising on the back of comments from CFO, 
Hans Dieter Poetsch, that next year's operating profit was likely to be 'clearly better' than in 2004 and Wolfgang 
Bernhard, former chief operating officer at Chrysler, was joining the board at VW.
Broker WestLB, upgraded the stock from 'neutral' to 'buy' on the back of the news.
In France, the worlds' sixth largest advertising company, Havas, slipped on concerns that it could soon lose its 
third-largest client, Intel, while Europe's top two carmakers, Peugeot and Renault, fell amid further fuel fears.
Sodexho, the French catering group, dropped 4.6% after it revealed full year sales figures were down by 1.6%.
Cosmetics giant L'Oreal fell back to less than 53 on the back of sales concerns highlighted by JP Morgan, which cut 
its recommendation on the firm from 'overweight' to 'neutral'.
In Switzerland, employment group, Adecco fell nearly 2% on the back of a downward re-rating from US broker, 
Morgan Stanley, from 'overweight' to 'equal weight'.
Oil concerns hamper European bourses
Drug giant Novartis ticked down to 59 on the back of Tuesday's decision by the UK government to suspend the 
manufacturing license for the flu vaccine, Chiron, in which Novartis has a 42% stake.

A deal has been reached by unions and management at Alitalia for 3,700 redundancies at the debt laden airline.
Meetings with government ministers paved the way for agreement late last night after weeks oc acrimonious talks.
The deal is now likely to open the way for restructuring aimed to pull the airline back from bankruptcy.
 The workers losing their jobs will stay on the airline's books for two years but will get social welfare payments from 
the Italian state. Yesterday, ahead of the agreement, Ryanair and other low cost European airlines claimed that the 
restructuring of Alitalia involves illegal state aid. The airlines, though their European Low Fares Airlines Association, 
delivered a letter to the European Commission protesting aabout the package and demanding to know what 
Brussels thinks of it. It is the third such letter from the association, which claims the Commission has broken its own 
code of practice by failing to state its views so far.

Body
US based aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing has predicted that Irish airlines will spend around E18bn on 300 
planes over the next 20 years.
Boeing, which is supplying Ryanair's new 737-800 fleet, said that the global aviation business had recovered from 
the fall in business caused by the September 11 attack on New York's World Trade Centre three years ago.
According to Drew Magill, director of market analysis with the multinational, this recovery will lead to significant 
demand from Irish carriers for new Boeing craft over the next two decades.
 Magill calculated that on a rough analysis, Irish-based carriers would probably need 300 new craft over the next 20 
years at a total projected cost of E18bn. He forecast that the majority of craft would be single-aisled Boeing 737 
type models. Currently, four out of five of the total Irish fleet are 737s. Boeing expects that European airlines will 
need a total of 7,000 craft, costing around E431bn, over the same period. The bulk of these will be the single-aisle 
type models.

Body
At a television studio in Washington DC in June, Kerry Skeen stood in front of a jazzed up pick-up truck with aircraft 
fins, and heralded the launch of Independence Air. A senator joined the chief executive for a two-minute 
endorsement of the new low-cost carrier. Employees, in T-shirts in the new corporate colours, offered boisterous 
applause.
The June launch was the most ambitious attempt yet by a US carrier to reinvent itself as a low cost airline. It 
marked the first time a regional airline - which typically offer contract services to larger carriers, using smaller 
regional jets - had reinvented itself as a standalone airline, wooing passengers directly.
Not only was the strategy unusual, so was the scale of its launch. The airline expects to offer 300 weekday 
departures, travelling to 39 cities by November 3, making Washington Dulles "the largest low fare hub in America in 
terms of total departures."
To stimulate demand, it offered fares up to 70 per cent lower than those charged in the past by rivals such as 
United. In mid-September it announced new low fares to Orlando and Tampa, with prices as low at Dollars 64 for 
one-way tickets.
Independence Air's reinvention is just one of the efforts to get on the low-cost bandwagon. Delta and United have 
launched their own faux low-cost offshoots, Song and Ted. Others are seeking a more extreme makeover: US 
Airways, which filed for its second bankruptcy in September, is explicitly using JetBlue and America West as a 
blueprint for its entire transformation.
New low-cost entrants are also poised to enter the market, such as Virgin America, the proposed new airline from 
Richard Branson, the British entrepreneur.
The airline is yet to finalise funding and its plan but Fred Reid, chief executive, in a speech verbally ticked off his 
checklist. "Management team in place. Done. Headquarters and operation base identified. Done. Aircraft fleet type 
selected. Done. Launch the Web site. Done. And, finally, name the baby. Done."
New carriers poised to enter US market LOW-COST AIRLINES: Caroline Daniel on the revolution in the skies 
above Washington
Mr Branson's arrival will reinforce a peculiarity about US low-cost carriers that marks them out from their European 
equivalents. Companies such as Ryanair have a reputation for cheap flights, cattle class seating and no service 
frills.
In the US, however, low cost carriers often offer a better full service product than their mainline rivals, which have 
instead been cutting back service to save money.
Virgin, for example, is expected to launch an upmarket product using Airbus A319s and A320s aimed at business 
travellers, targeting transcontinental routes.
JetBlue has leather seats, live satellite TV and online booking for corporate travel departments. ATA is introducing a 
new business class service, with more leg room on its flights, as is Spirit. AirTran has offered a business section for 
the last seven years.
The success of the low-cost carriers in grabbing market share is evident. They have grown from 5 per cent of the 
market in 1987 to about a quarter of it, according to Airline Monitor.
A study from Accenture, the management consultancy, showed that nearly one quarter of business travellers 
primarily used low-cost carriers.
Moreover, the low-cost carriers have unleashed a brutal fare war. Mainline carriers have been trying to match them 
on pricing where they compete. They have also tried to pre-empt the incursion of low-cost carriers by lowering 
fares, such as Delta's initiative at its Cincinatti hub where it controls 90 per cent of the market.
American has just announced round trip fares from New York to Orlando, for Dollars 118.
The fare wars, especially on transcontinental routes, which until the arrival of JetBlue three years ago, had 
previously been largely insulated from low-cost carriers, have helped drive down yields.
In July, the Air Transport Association said domestic yields were down 2.5 per cent, compared with rises on 
international routes.
However, not all the low-cost carriers will survive. They are being hit hard by high fuel prices, which will force 
airlines such as America West, to report losses this year. Frontier, based in Denver, is struggling from the fightback 
by United, and will also be loss-making this year, according to Merrill Lynch forecasts.
Independence Air's reinvention, while cheap for its customers, has come with a big price tag. In the second quarter 
it swung from a profit of Dollars 45.7m a year ago to losses of Dollars 27m.
Trying to create a brand from scratch has sent its sales and marketing costs soaring 240 per cent, or 9.3 per cent of 
revenues.
Merrill Lynch is forecasting its operating margins in the September quarter will be the lowest of the industry, at 
negative 36.8 per cent.
Although ATA has low costs it is not immune to industry pressures. Its margins have been hit by its low fares, and it 
confronts "substantial additional liquidity concerns" as it faces operating lease payments in the first quarter of 2005.
Unless it can renegotiate its debts it could yet emerge as the first bankruptcy of a low cost carrier of the current 
aviation downturn.

Low cost Irish airline, Ryanair, today said it had sold its remaining 20 Boeing aircraft to Autodirect Aviation LLC for 
USD10m.
The 20 Boeing 737-200 aircraft were manufactured between 1980 and 1983 and 6 of the 20 aircraft have already 
been retired by Ryanair from operation. 
The remaining 14 will be delivered to Autodirect post their scheduled retirement between November 2004 and 
December 2005. The aircraft, spare parts and engines will be fully depreciated at their date of disposal and 
accordingly, there is no gain or loss arising on their disposal.
Autodirect is a US based corporation, which supplies used aircraft and spare parts to the airline industry.
 Speaking on today's announcement, Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive, Howard Millar said: "We are pleased to 
have reached an agreement deal with Autodirect to sell our Boeing 737-200 aircraft on their retirement from the 
Ryanair fleet. By the end of next year, Ryanair will have one of the youngest aircraft fleets in Europe and be the 
largest operator of Boeing Next Generation 737 aircraft".

Body
Low-cost airline Ryanair, which today started flights to the Latvian capital Riga, said it is looking at introducing 
flights to Lithuania next year. 
"We are looking at two airports in Lithuania, which have potential and are evaluating and analysing the situation," 
said Berner Berger, head of new flights development department at Ryanair. 
"But it is very important that the Lithuanian government ensures that costs are low because economic development 
could go faster if the country is accessible," Berger added.
 Today Berger met Vilnius Mayor Arturas Zuokas, the vice mayor of the second-largest city Kaunas and Deputy 
Transport Minister Valdemaras Salauskas to discuss Ryanair's future in Lithuania. Salauskas said, after meeting 
with Berger, that Ryanair intended to begin services to Lithuania from September 2005 and planned to carry 
200,000 passengers a year. The airline plans to offer flights from Kaunas to seven European cities, including 
London, Frankfurt and Rome, he added.

The Dublin market fell sharply today as investors sold off banking stocks and Ryanair shares tumbled.
At the closing bell, the ISEQ index of leading Irish shares fell by 51.13 points to 5,610.33.
Banks bore the brunt of a general sell-off of heavyweight stocks. Bank of Ireland led the day's faller with shares

gain of 6c to 596. Shares in low cost carrier Ryanair fell by 14c to 400 as investors continued to be wary of 
committing to the stock amid repeated warnings from the airline that increasing competition would impact on its 
bottom line in the near future.

Ryanair has signalled a major departure in its no-frills policy by deciding to offer in-flight entertainment (IFE) on its 
low-cost services.
The airline expects the move to have an immediate impact on its bottom line, with at least [euro]14 million ($17 
million) in first-year earnings predicted from its new portable IFE system, which will be tested on selected London 
Stansted services from 1 November.
Known as the DigEplayer 5500, the system has been developed by Tacoma-based Aircraft Protective Systems 
(APS) and comprises a hand-held unit weighing about 1.5kg (3.3lb) with a screen the size of a small paperback 
book.
It has simple menu-selection and visual/audio controls, much like a portable digital versatile disc (DVD) player, 
except that the entertainment programme is stored on a 40Gb hard drive. It operates on a 10h battery.
Ryanair is committing to 6,000 units initially and will offer the system on five Stansted-based aircraft to begin with, 
providing 24 units on each flight.
If the trial is successful, the carrier will make the system available across its entire Boeing 737-800 fleet by March.
KLM has also signed a contract for an unspecified number of DigEplayers which it will initially offer in the first-class 
cabins of its Boeing 737s.
APS founder and chairman Bill Boyer says that the system will provide a range of entertainment, including films, 
pre-recorded television programmes, music and games.
Ryanair shoots to frill with video; Budget carrier to test IFE system on five Stansted aircraft
Boyer, a former baggage-handler for Alaska Airlines, developed the DigEplayer idea after Alaska cancelled plans to 
install a dedicated IFE system on more than 80 of its aircraft.
Alaska Airlines now uses the APS equipment -- it has reserved 5,000 units -- while Canadian low-cost carrier 
Jetsgo offers the system on flights lasting for 3h or longer.
 
O'Leary's latest revolution
 
David Kaminski-Morrow
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary says he is "amazingly excited" about the introduction of in-flight entertainment: "We 
think this is the next revolution in the low-fare airline industry." He adds that the carrier's income estimate from the 
system is based on a 3% market penetration. But he believes the actual take-up will be much higher.
The consoles will be handed out at the beginning of the flight for a flat fee "on a first-come, first-served basis". 
O'Leary says the charge will be about £5 ($9) but adds: "We don't know where the pricing will end up -- it will 
probably be a dynamic scale depending on the flight."
O'Leary says that, given the high cost of the units, the primary concern is theft. The carrier plans to ask passengers 
who want to use a console to hand over their passport or other means of identification as security.
Ryanair will update the content every two months, although O'Leary says this could be reduced to a month. The 
carrier will also review demand for the system on its services and adjust the number of consoles available 
accordingly.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he would double the number of passengers using Shannon airport if 
the incoming board slashes charges.
O'Leary told the board that if it cut its levies, Ryanair would add 10 new routes from the airport, serving the UK and 
Europe, the Sunday Times reports.
According to the Ryanair boss, these new routes would increase the passenger throughput at Shannon by 2m and 
create 2,000 jobs. Last year 2.3m used the regional airport.
 However, in return, O'Leary has demanded a dramatic reduction in landing charges per passenger from their 
current level of E7.50 to just E1. Pat Shanahan, the incoming chairman of the Shannon Airport Authority, has 
already said his priorities will include cutting costs and doubling passenger numbers.

EasyJet has still not mastered the art of communicating with the markets. Expectations had mounted that a strategy 
review would be announced. 
Instead, there was a review of capacity, but even that was hardly radical. Its fleet is expected to total 108 aircraft by 
next September instead of the initially expected 115. The low-cost airline also plans new routes to Ireland, currently 
served by arch-rival Ryanair and Aer Lingus. EasyJet has been eyeing the substantial margins on the UK-Ireland 
hop. Ryanair could well shy way from a price war, which might just eat into margins, rather than knock out its 
competitor. The Irish expansion may yet provide a much-needed stream of non-seasonal travel for EasyJet.
It is hard for Ray Webster, EasyJet's chief executive, not to be vague on the short-term outlook, but investors 
continue to penalise him for failing to warn them of dangers earlier this year. Mr Webster reiterated that the winter 
will be tough for Europe's low-cost airlines. But with that as a given, Ryanair still looks in better shape to withstand 
the headwinds of slashed fares and higher fuel costs. CSFB estimates that, for every 1 per cent fall in yields, 
Ryanair's net earnings will decline by 6 per cent and EasyJet's by 18 per cent. Similarly, Ryanair has more margin 
room to absorb higher fuel costs. EasyJet shares will stay grounded, at least until after this winter's storms.

EasyJet flies into rival Ryanair 's patch of the sky

EasyJet, the low-cost airline, fired a warning shot yesterday at Ryanair, its Irish rival, by moving into the Republic of 
Ireland market for the first time.
It has decided to tread directly on Ryanair's home turf through the launch of three routes from London Gatwick to 
Cork, Knock and Shannon.
The two carriers, Europe's two biggest low-cost airlines, have largely avoided head-to-head rivalry on the same 
routes to date but, as their networks grow rapidly around Europe, so does the threat of direct competition.
EasyJet's foray into Ryanair territory comes in spite of a cut in planned capacity growth for next year and a warning 
of continuing downward pressure on fares in 2005, which combined to prompt a sharp fall in its share price 
yesterday.
The airline's move into the Republic of Ireland - it has a significant presence in Belfast, where Ryanair is absent - 
has been provoked in part by recent moves by its Irish rival.
Ryanair has announced plans to go head-to-head with its rival on two of EasyJet's newest routes from London 
Stansted to Valencia and Almeria in Spain. It has also moved to expand its presence at London Luton, EasyJet's 
headquarters airport.
"There is a big enough playground out there," said an EasyJet spokesman. But the Ryanair moves to enter the two 
Spanish destinations "seemed like a deliberate provocation".
EasyJet believes that Ryanair's routes from the three Irish points to Stansted are among its most profitable because 
they have faced little competition.
Ray Webster, EasyJet chief executive, took aim directly at Ryanair's image of always having the lowest fares. 
"These are our first services to the Republic of Ireland, where air fares, in many cases, have remained stubbornly 
high," he said.
EasyJet flies into rival Ryanair 's patch of the sky
In a further turn of the competitive screw, EasyJet said yesterday that it was also adding daily services to Valencia 
and Almeria from Gatwick.
But EasyJet said yesterday it would cut its planned capacity growth next year from 24 to 16 per cent as it raised its 
profits forecast for the financial year ending September 30 from more than Pounds 52m to more than Pounds 60m.
In spite of that, its share price fell by 11p or 8 per cent to close at an all-time low of 128p as worries over high fuel 
prices persisted. The share price has failed to recover from two profit warnings earlier this year and EasyJet has 
been the worst performing stock in the FTSE 350 index since the start of the year, falling by about 56 per cent. Lex,

Booming air travel - particularly on short-haul European flights with cut-price operators - gave a lift to Alpha Airports, 
the airline caterer.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 were up almost 23 per cent from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 9.7m. 
Turnover rose from Pounds 214m to Pounds 239m, and earnings per share rose from 2.46p to 3.14p.
Alpha's profits are divided between duty-free shops in 62 airports and in-flight meals for more than 100 airlines. 
EasyJet and Ryanair are two of the biggest customers, and the bulk of the revenue is from regional airports in the 
UK not run by BAA.
Kevin Abbott, chief executive, said: "The scale and profitability of our business has become increasingly important 
to airlines such as EasyJet. As their yield comes under pressure, they are looking at all ancillary ways of making 
money."
He added: "Despite the growth of new bases used by the low-cost airlines, we have increased spend per passenger 
by 12 per cent."
He was also confident that the growth would continue. "All the forecasts are for annual growth of 10-15 per cent in 
Europe over the next few years," he said.
Alpha said that as well as growth from short-haul, it had seen increases in long-haul flights from Heathrow and 
Amman, which had both recovered from the conflict in Iraq.
It was confident it could fill the capacity at Heathrow created by the recent loss of a contract with Air Canada. The 
company expects to replace the contract with a new airline early next year.
Meanwhile, old-fashioned tray meals are being phased out in favour of trendier packaging and "high street menus".
Airline caterer confident of continued growth
The weak dollar reduced profits by Pounds 600,000 and Alpha incurred Pounds 900,000 in costs associated with 
new contract start-ups. The group also warned that one-off investments would hit second-half profits, but said 
underlying trading remained in line with expectations.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 1p but Mr Abbott said the company expected to continue its policy of raising 
the final pay-out. Analysts are forecasting 4p against 3.8p for the previous full year. The shares firmed 1/2p to 86 
1/2p.

A number of international institutional investors are understood to have shown interest in taking equity in State 
airline Aer Lingus if it is made available.
Although the airline sector has been out of favour for some time now due to rising oil prices, the Irish Times reports 
that several investors have made private inquiries about the airline in recent months.
According to senior market sources, cited by the newspaper, among the institutions who may come forward in any 
placement are Fidelity Group, the Capital Group and Barclays.
 All three have been long-standing shareholdings in the aviation industry. Fidelity is a large shareholder in Ryanair, 
EasyJet and British Airways, while Barclays and Capital Group are also shareholders in British Airways. A Cabinet 
sub-committee, chaired by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, is studying the future of the airline, although nothing is 
expected to happen on the issue until after the Government reshuffle next week.

A group of Ryanair pilots are set to break with the company's policy and set up their own association through which

According to the Irish Times, the new association, to be called the Ryanair European Pilots Association, will have

The association, which will be supported by the European Cockpit Association, is preparing to launch a website for

 Sources cited by the newspaper said that the move to set up a Europe-wide association is an attempt to create a 
wide forum that will span various EU states and represent pilots from Ryanair's 11 bases. Last month, the 
European Transport Workers' Federation, which has been studying Ryanair's work practices, launched a Europe-

Ryanair hopes to tap a fresh source of revenue by becoming the first low-cost airline in Europe to offer in-flight 
entertainment.
"We expect to make enormous sums of money," said Michael O'Leary, chief executive, yesterday. "We wouldn't do 
it if we didn't think it had huge revenue potential."
Passengers, who will be charged about Pounds 5 or Euros 7 a flight for the service, will have to hand over their 
passport or driving licence to encourage them not to stroll off with the handheld Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,120) 
devices.
The so-called digEboxes have been developed by an American former baggage-handler, Bill Boyer, through his 
company APS, based in Washington State.
They will show a range of entertainment from the latest movies to cartoons, sports and music videos and classic 
comedy shows.
Mr Boyer worked as a baggage handler for Seattle-based Alaska Airlines when he was a student nearly 20 years

Ryanair, Europe's leading no-frills carrier, is introducing inflight entertainment for the first time to low-cost airlines in 
Europe, intensifying competition in the sector that is already being buffeted by a fierce price war and severe 
overcapacity.
It will use a handheld device, the size of a portable DVD player, showing a range of entertainment from the latest 
movies to cartoons, sports and music videos.
It plans to charge about Euros 7 a flight for the service. Passengers will be obliged to hand over their passport or 
driving licence as a deposit, to encourage them not to walk off with the Dollars 2,000 devices.
The airline hopes inflight entertainment will create a significant new stream of revenues in the face of further 
declines in fare levels. "We expect to make enormous sums of money," Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said 
yesterday.
Ryanair will begin trials on five aircraft flying out of its main base at London Stansted airport from November 1 and

It was first introduced on Seattle-based Alaska Airlines last year and in recent months has also been launched by 
Hawaiian Airlines and Jetsgo, the Canadian low-cost carrier.
The so-called digEboxes have been developed by a US designer and inventor Bill Boyer through his company APS, 
based in Tacoma, Washington State.

Low-cost airlines are expected to carry as many as 80m passengers in Europe in 2004, up from 47m last year, 
Wolfgang Kurth, president of the European Low Fares Airlines Association, said yesterday.
The no-frills operators were forecast to capture around 18 per cent of the market on intra-European routes this year, 
as they both opened new routes and took market share from the traditional network airlines.
Mr Kurth, chief executive of Hapag Lloyd-Express (HLX), the German low-cost carrier and a subsidiary of Tui, 
Europe's largest tour operator, said the recent growth rate of about 40 per cent a year in passenger volumes was 
expected to continue for at least another two years.
He played down recent warnings from Ryanair and EasyJet, the leading European low-cost airlines, of a looming 
"bloodbath" in the sector in the face of a fierce price war and serious overcapacity.
There are currently 67 low-cost carriers operating in Europe, said Mr Kurth, and while a process of consolidation 
was eventually inevitable, for the moment new carriers were still entering the market to replace those that 
collapsed.
In Germany alone the number of routes operated by low-cost carriers had grown from four in 2002 to 300 today, 
while the number of no-frills airlines had jumped from two to 15.
Mr Kurth said the number of seats offered by the low-cost carrier sector had jumped from 700,000 in a sample week 
in July 2000 to 7.5m in the same week this year.
HLX was planning to raise its own capacity by 35 per cent by next summer with its fleet growing from 11 to 15 
aircraft.
Mr Kurth said that average fares were expected to fall further in coming years, which would lead to additional cost-
cutting measures by the no-frills operators.
Pressure would be increased on both aircraft makers and airports to cut charges.
 Low-cost flights soar in Europe
At the same time airports would need to provide more basic facilities designed for low cost airlines.

Body
Sir Richard Branson, majority owner of Virgin Express, the Brussels-based low-cost airline, and the Belgian 
shareholders of SN Brussels Airlines, are close to agreeing a merger of the two carriers.
The deal was backed yesterday by the board of SN Airholding II, which holds 92 per cent of the equity in SN 
Brussels. It is due to be considered next week by the board of Virgin Express Holdings.
The merger would bring together the two leading carriers at Brussels Zaventem airport as part of the growing 
consolidation of the European airline industry.
SN Brussels emerged in 2002 from the collapse in late 2001 of Sabena, the former Belgian flag carrier. It was 
backed by a large group of Belgian financial institutions and industrial groups in a rescue led by Etienne Davignon, 
vice-chairman of Suez-Tractebel and a former vice-president of the European Commission. Its main shareholders 
include Tractebel, the utility company, the financial institutions KBC, Dexia, Fortis and ING, Brussels airport and the 
Walloon regional government.
If the merger goes ahead, it is expected SN Airholding will control 100 per cent of Virgin Express and 92 per cent of 
SN Brussels.
Sir Richard's airline investment vehicle, Virgin Sky Investments, holds an 89 per cent stake in Virgin Express 
Holdings, which is expected to take a stake of about 29.9 per cent in SN Airholding.
Talks between the two groups have been under way for 12 months.
The airlines are seeking a way to rationalise capacity at Brussels airport in the face of tough competition in the 
Belgian market from European flag carriers and Ryanair, the rival low-cost airline operating from nearby Charleroi 
airport.
SN Brussels and Virgin close to deal AIRLINES:
It is expected that the two airlines will be maintained as separate brands offering different products with Virgin 
Express continuing as a low-cost carrier and SN Brussels operating as a full-service airline including its long-haul 
network to Africa.
The two airlines fly in direct competition on several European short-haul routes, however, and these are expected to 
be rationalised.
SN Brussels has improved its financial performance this year and achieved a Euros 1.9m (Dollars 2.3m) net profit in 
the first half compared with a net loss of Euros 23.4m in the same period a year ago.
Virgin Express, which has been restructured and rationalised in the past two years, is struggling to return to profit in 
the face of the fierce fare war and overcapacity.

Ryanair has demanded that the Walloon Regional Government's letter demanding the return of illegal airport

The region, and Charleroi Airport, are seeking the return of E4m following a decision by the European Commission 
which ruled that incentives which Ryanair received for setting up a hub at the airport constituted illegal state aid.
Ryanair, which is appealing the ruling, said in May that a request for the return of money by the Walloon Regional 
Government had been met with a "curt" response.
 The authorities at Wallonia were recently given until September 15 to begin recovering the funds. A letter was sent 
out on Monday of last week and Ryanair responded to reports that this had occurred by saying it would dismiss any 
such request, the Irish Times reports. Yesterday Ryanair said that it had received an 18-page letter from the 
Walloon Regional Government late on Friday evening.

Body
Michael O'Leary, the ebullient chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair, warned rivals that fares would continue to 
fall in the coming year, according to reports in the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian newspapers.
O'Leary told a UBS transport conference yesterday that the price war currently engulfing the no-frills airline industry 
would drive fares even lower in 2005, said the report. 
Airlines around the world are recovering from a prolonged economic downturn exacerbated by the war in Iraq and 
the outbreak of the Sars virus last year. 
 However, soaring oil prices and a price war on short-haul routes are holding back profits and O'Leary said he 
expected conditions to remain tough. O'Leary said falls in average fares in the second half would be at the worse 
end of its 10-20pc forecast range. He said he could not tell how low fares would be cut. The company said it 
continued to expect a 20pc rise in full-year profits after tax.

Transport Minister Seamus Brennan has referred the idea of a privately owned second terminal to the new Dublin

The controversial idea of a private terminal, which has been strongly advocated by Ryanair, has for a long time 
been fiercely opposed by Aer Rianta unions. 
The company's chairman, Noel Hanlon, has made no secret of his preference for a single airport operator at Dublin.
 However, Brennan said extra terminal capacity at the airport was needed and he hinted that, based on the 
continued strong growth of passengers using the airport, more than one terminal may be required. He has asked 
the airport authority for its "very urgent" views on the proposals and said that a final decision on the structure of a 
second terminal could be taken over the next few months.

Irish budget carrier, Ryanair, said it still expects profits to grow 20pc this year but warned that its fare war with

"Yield (average fare) declines in H1 now look like they are at the lower end of our 5-10pc range, but we are still very 
cautious on the second half," chief executive Michael O'Leary told a conference in London.
O'Leary said he expected conditions to remain difficult. "It is going to be awful out there. There are going to be 
continuing fare wars in 2005," he said.
 However, he expected fuel prices would go down, with oil returning to about USD30 a barrel by next summer. He 
also said that Ryanair had no short term plans to change its hedging strategy, despite a recent decline in fuel 
prices. "Fuel has improved a little bit. But it is fluctuating around so wildly there is no point in worrying about it," he 
said. Ryanair's exposure to oil is currently hedged at USD26 a barrel until the end of October. The firm has said

A Belgian minister has called on budget airline Ryanair to repay some of the aid it received for the use of Charleroi

The minister in charge of airports for the Walloon region, Andre Antoine, said he would write to the airline's

"When the policeman tells you to pay a fine, then that's what you have to do," Antoine said on RTL-TVI television. 
 Charleroi airport chief Laurent Jossart said the airline would be asked to pay back E4m following a ruling by the 
European Commission that some of the aid paid to Ryanair by the publicly-owned airport south of Brussels 
amounted to illegal state aid. Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary hinted in the British media Thursday that he might not 
repay the aid. The airline unsuccessfully appealed the ruling in May at the European Court of Justice. Its sales 
director David Gering said at a press conference in Brussels Wednesday that he saw "enormous potential" in the 
Charleroi airport if Ryanair could reach an agreement with the Walloon authorities and the airport on a new

EUjet, a new no frills airline which will begin flying from Shannon Airport next week, is expected to announce the

According to the Irish Times, EUjet, which was established by former Ryanair chief executive PJ McGoldrick, is 
expected to blame Aer Lingus's continued operation on that route for its decision.
Aer Lingus carries passengers between the two airports on its transatlantic flights which results in the availability of 
early flights from Shannon but no return flight. 
 Shannon Airport has been keen to develop a regular service between the two airports mainly to cater for business 
travellers and had encouraged the adoption of this new route. In June, Transport Minister Seamus Brennan 
announced the opening of EUjet in Shannon and welcomed the launch of scheduled flights between the airport and

 (ANSA) - Rome, September 9 - Irish no-frills air carrier Ryanair is willing to hire the pilots of troubled Italian flag 
carrier Alitalia, who are threatened by lay-offs, if they are ready to fly more hours yearly, CEO Michael O'Leary said.
 Ryanair has already employed laid off specialists from other air carriers including SAS, Lufthansa, British Airways 
and Maersk Air in the last two years.
The company has hired also employees from other Italian air companies such as Volare and Maridiana.
 The expansion plans of the Irish carrier, concerning the flights at the Rome's airport Ciampino, envisages the 
creation of 200 new jobs for pilots, engineers and flight attendants in the next two years.
 The newly-hired pilots could receive higher wages at Ryanair, but they must fly at least 815 hours annually as all 
the pilots of the company compared to the near 400 hours per year reached by their Italian colleagues at Alitalia, 
which is the lowest level in Europe, O'Leary said.
 The average salary in Ryanair stands at 52, 000 euro ($ 63, 404) against the average 38, 000 euro ($ 46, 333) paid 
to the pilots in Alitalia. The salary of Ryenair's chief pilots reaches 130, 000 euro ($ 158, 509).
 O'Leary announced that the company planned investments for $ 120 mln (98. 4 mln euro) and the launching of five 
European routes flying from Ciampino to Germany, Spain and Britain

Alitalia plans to cut 5, 000 jobs in the period 2005 to 2006, including 450 pilots.

based low-cost airline controlled by Sir Richard Branson, said "positive discussions" about a merger were 
continuing with SN Brussels Airlines, writes Kevin Done.
David Hoare, executive chairman, said at the interim results that the "harsh market conditions confirm our view that 
consolidation is essential in the European short-haul market". 
Ticket prices had fallen for most airlines. Virgin Express has suffered problems on its Rome and Milan routes, 
where it faces competition from Alitalia, Ryanair and SNBrussels, the carrier that emerged from the collapse in 2001 
of Sabena, the former Belgian flag carrier. Under the terms of a non-binding letter of intent signed in March, Virgin 
would end up with 29.9 per cent of a new holding company SN Airholding. It would have a put option to sell its stake 
for Euros 64m (Pounds 43.6m) in 2005-06 and it could grant a call option allowing SN Brussels to buy the stake for 
Euros 100m.

At first sight, the row between Ryanair and the European Commission has little to do with the business traveller. 
The war of words is an entertaining read on the business flight to Munich, but it is all about transporting tourists and 
stag parties rather than serious executives - or is it?
Some observers believe the colourful exchanges between Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief, and Brussels 
authorities are part of a battle for control of the pace of change in European air transport, a change that would affect 
all air travellers.
It is ironic that the trouble came over flights in and out of Strasbourg, one of the homes of the European parliament, 
and Brussels, the heart of what Mr O'Leary has called the "evil empire" of regulators.
Europe has over-capacity in airports and many regional airports, developed with high hopes for business 
stimulation, have remained quiet backwaters. Many are in the public sector, including all those in France.
Hans Huber, assistant professor of strategic management at the Audencia Nantes School of Management, says 
these airports are waking up to the opportunities presented by low-cost carriers and are adapting their business 
models to attract them.
The first deal to cause controversy involved the little airport at Strasbourg.
The local chamber of commerce agreed to pay Ryanair's publicity costs, prompting a protest from rival Brit Air, an 
Air France subsidiary. A French tribunal ruled that this constituted illegal state aid, and Ryanair switched its flights 
to Baden-Baden, about 40 miles away.
That was merely a skirmish. The real battle is over flights in and out of Brussels - or at least in and out of Charleroi, 
optimistically described on airport departure boards as Brussels South.
The Walloon government, which owns Charleroi, offered Ryanair big discounts on landing and ground handling 
charges, help with marketing, pilot training and hotel accommodation and grants towards opening new routes.
Airline wars can have tough consequences LOW-COST AIRLINES IN THE UK: Tom Lynch on how carriers are 
adapting to corporate travellers
The main Brussels airport, at Zaventem, objected and the commission ordered the airline to repay some of the 
money, a sum estimated by Mr O'Leary at Euros 3m.
He told the media, using typically colourful language, that he had refused to pay.
More conventionally, the Irish airline also launched an appeal to the European Court. It also struck a new deal with 
Charleroi, which it says keeps its costs the same and complies with the commission's rules.
It dropped its link between Charleroi and London Stansted, but is still far and away the airport's main customer, 
operating 11 routes.
The outcome of the appeal is awaited with some interest. What the European Commission sees as subsidies, 
Ryanair and the smaller airports see as investment in economic development.
The reaction to the commission decision demonstrated that lumping low-cost airlines together can be misleading. 
UK-based EasyJet, Ryanair's main European rival, welcomed the ruling as "supportive of the low-cost airline 
industry". Ryanair in turn dismissed EasyJet as "just another high-fares airline" and devotes a page in its website to 
an attack on EasyJet.
Mr Huber identifies EasyJet and Ryanair as typifying two different models of the low-cost airline.
EasyJet tends to use bigger, more central airports and run more frequent flights. These factors make it more 
attractive to business travellers, even though its unit costs are higher than Ryanair's. It already serves Eastern 
Europe, where there is high potential for growth. However, growth is constrained by the stranglehold the national 
carriers have on slots at the main airports.
Ryanair still has the lowest costs in the industry, but it is less well suited for the business traveller, says Mr Huber. 
Many of the airports it serves lack business facilities and are a long way from city centres.
For example, Ryanair uses Hahn for Frankfurt, even though it is 100km away.
"A passenger does not want to pay for a low-cost fight, only to be charged Euros 100 for a taxi to actually reach 
their destination," said Joachim Hunold, chief executive of the German airline Air Berlin, Europe's third largest low-
cost operator.
Ryanair's seating is densely packed and uncomfortable, says Mr Huber, and it has also announced that it is to 
discourage hold baggage, arguing that tourists can buy their clothes on arrival. That is all very well for a T-shirt and 
shorts, but less practical for a business suit.
Another difference is that some low-cost airlines are looking for alliances: Mr Hunold said Air Berlin is seeking tie-
ups with other airlines such as NIKI, Germania Express and TUI.
Mr Huber says Ryanair has good grounds for its appeal, and argues that its business model presents more of a 
threat to the airline status quo than that of EasyJet.
"The integration of the EU, especially the expansion to the east will further open growth potential to low-cost 
carriers that can set up hubs across Europe, something that is not as easily possible for the 'national' carriers," he 
says.
"Ryanair is very helpful in this transformation process. The new airlines are more efficient, and it's in the interest of 
the EU to have a more efficient business model. But the EU might be afraid that the restructuring is going too fast."
There is one way that business travellers could benefit from the shakeup. Mr Huber suggests that a new type of 
airline could emerge, replicating Ryanair's model of serving smaller airports efficiently and linking with Eastern

Europe from secondary hubs inside Western Europe. It could use smaller jets, targeting business passengers with 
fares much lower than offered by the national carriers.
Such an airline was started in the Vendee region of France in the 1980s. It was called Air Regionale and was so 
successful that it was sold to Air France for a large profit.

Body
Charleroi Airport in Belgium has asked for an E4m reimbursement for some of the aid it gave Ryanair that was later 
declared illegal by the European Commission, airport chief Laurent Jossart said today.
"A letter is going to be sent shortly to Ryanair to ask it to repay an amount of about E4m," Jossart said in an 
interview published in the daily La Libre Belgique.
At a news conference in Brussels, David Gering, Ryanair sales director for the Benelux countries refused to confirm 
the amount sought by the airport.
 However, he noted that it must be defined by September 15 and that Ryanair "would respect the law," signalling 
that it would reimburse the airport while awaiting the outcome of its appeal of the decision. The European 
Commission ruled in February that around E4m out of E15m of incentives paid to Ryanair by Charleroi Airport 
Authority amounted to illegal state aid. Ryanair appealed the ruling in May at the European Court of Justice. 
Ryanair's Gering said he saw "enormous potential" in the airport if Ryanair reaches an agreement with the Walloon 
state owners and the airport on a new schedule of airport services fees.

The airline launched with scheduled flights to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Dublin, Girona and Nice and will later 
serve Barcelona, Edinburgh, Faro, Glasgow, Jersey, Madrid, Malaga, Manchester, Milan, Murcia, Palma, Prague 
and Shannon from Kent. It will add the winter ski destinations of Geneva, Salzburg, Toulouse, Turin and Zurich from 
December. A Shannon operation will be launched on 15 September, serving Dublin, Faro, Geneva, Kent, Malaga 
and Murcia. EUjet hopes to carry at least 500,000 passengers in its first year of operation. Kent airport owner and

Bulgaria Air is to be privatised in two stages and a foreign airline is likely to be chosen to acquire a strategic holding 
in the state-owned carrier under plans drawn up by the Bulgarian government, writes Igor Salinger.
The strategic partner will be selected on the basis of price, proposed investment programme, reputation and 
experience.
Consortia wishing to bid must be at least 51% controlled by an aviation company with more than [euro]100 million 
($123 million) of annual revenue during the past three years. Financial investors can bid if they manage over 
[euro]200 million of assets.
The proposed sale "will hopefully be approved by parliament by the end of September", says Yordan Mirchev, chair 
of the Bulgarian parliamentary transport commission.
The new plan aims to prevent a repeat of the disastrous attempt to privatise former flag carrier Balkan Bulgarian 
Airlines, which was declared bankrupt at the end of 2002 following its sale to the Israeli Zeevi group three years 
before for $150,000, says Mirchev.
Bulgaria Air was established as the successor to Balkan in December 2002 and operates seven Boeing 737-300s 
and one 737-500 on scheduled and charter services within Europe and to the Middle East. The airline reported an 
after-tax profit of 1.5 million levs ($940,000) in 2003.
Meanwhile, European low-cost carriers are expected to enter the Bulgarian market next year. Hungary's low-cost 
airline Wizz Air may launch flights to Bulgaria and Romania after the two countries sign an "open skies" agreement. 
Sky Europe and Ryanair intend to serve Varna and Burgas on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast, says Bulgarian civil 
aviation administration head Kalin Barzov.

Body
British Airways shrugged off the impact of the recent spate of flight cancellations and yesterday held to its previous 
forecasts for revenue growth this year.
BA said 140 flights were cancelled in the last nine days of August as a result of the serious disruptions at its 
Heathrow operations last week.
BA estimated that the disruptions had cut one percentage point off the growth in passenger traffic volumes in 
August.
But the airline said it still expected its revenues to increase by between 2 per cent and 3 per cent in the current year 
to the end of March, ending three successive years of declining sales.
The BA share price closed yesterday 7p, or 3.1 per cent, higher at 232 3/4p.
The airline, which issued its monthly traffic update yesterday, said operations were largely back on track during the 
bank holiday weekend, BA's busiest days in the year, thanks to emergency measures and the use of volunteers to 
overcome staff shortages.
But it added that it had continued to cancel a handful of flights on a daily basis this week to ensure that it could 
carry out "a robust and reliable operation".
The airline was shaken by the scale of the disruption on Monday last week at its Heathrow operations, when 48 
flights were cancelled.
The problems arose only days after it had averted the threat of a strike by baggage handlers, ground staff and 
check-in staff by reaching a last-minute pay deal.
Rod Eddington, chief executive, has ordered an urgent review into the operations problems and is due to report to 
the BA board on September 17.
BA keeps to forecasts despite cancellations
BA said premium traffic rose by 5 per cent last month but this was due in part of heavy promotions to leisure 
travellers in a month with low levels of business traffic.
Meanwhile Ryanair, the Irish low-cost airline, said its passenger volumes rose by 20 per cent year-on-year in 
August to 2.57m.
It filled 92 per cent of its available seats, up from 90 per cent a year ago.
The leading European low-cost carrier has moved well ahead of British Airways in European short-haul markets, 
where BA carried 2.17m passengers last month.

EUjet, a start-up Irish airline founded by PJ McGoldrick, a former chief executive of Ryanair, has became the latest 
low-cost carrier to begin European operations despite warnings - by Ryanair and EasyJet, the leading no-frills 
carriers - of a looming "bloodbath" in the sector.
A fierce price war is being waged among low cost airlines across Europe in the face of serious overcapacity and the 
launch of a host of new entrant carriers eager to imitate the success of Ryanair and EasyJet.
EUjet is launching a planned network of 22 European routes from Manston airport in Kent, the first passenger 
services from the airport. Kevin Done

BNP Paribas is to set up a team in Tokyo to arrange Japanese operating leases. The team will be headed by 
Nicolas Parrot, head of the Asian team of BNP's Aviation Finance Group in Singapore. While the French bank has 
arranged the debt portion for a large number of JOLs in the past few years, it has not had the ability to arrange the 
equity portion. 
Eric Eugène, global head of the bank's Aviation Finance Group, says the new capability will be a natural fit for BNP 
Paribas, and Capstar Partners, its boutique leveraged leasing subsidiary, which will jointly manage the JOL 
business. "BNP and Capstar have a long history of arranging cross-border leases on aircraft and other assets, 
including French tax leases and our own proprietary lease products. It makes a lot of sense to also have the ability 
to arrange JOLs, as the Japanese lease market has proved to be the most resilient and it provides us with a full 
compliment of lease products," says Eugène. BNP has no doubt been encouraged by the success of other non-
Japanese banks, including Credit Agricole Indosuez, West LB and Citigroup, in arranging JOL equity. "We certainly 
believe we can be successful as we are actively lending into JOL deals and have very established contacts with 
airlines around the world," says the banker. Eugène suggests that consolidation in the Japanese bank market may 
provide greater opportunities for the French institution to work with players in the JOL market as well as Japanese 
investors. BNP Paribas is also setting up the Tokyo team in response to feedback from the airline community. 
"Many airlines have traditionally sought JOL equity and debt offers separately, but have responded very positively 
to our initiative," says Eugène. The new lease team will concentrate for the most part on aircraft assets, reflecting 
that the great majority of JOL deals are for the air transport industry. However, the department will also pursue 
transactions for other types of assets. Most other JOLs have been arranged for ships but buses and rolling stock 
are also feasible asset classes, according to market sources. Parrot will join the newly founded structured finance 
department of BNP Paribas Tokyo in mid-October. Arnaud Fiscel will replace Parrot as head of the Asian aviation 
finance group. Fiscel is based in Paris in charge of European accounts including Aeroflot, British Airways and 
Ryanair and . BNP, will also consider hiring experienced JOL professionals to join its Tokyo team as the business 
develops. In addition, Clémence de Beaucé will join the team in Singapore.

Alitalia has 'one month'

Alitalia's share price yesterday fell to an all-time low after the lossmaking Italian airline said it had enough liquidity to 
survive one month.
As Alitalia management convened a fresh round of talks with trade unions to discuss a rescue plan, its shares 
dropped 6 per cent to Euros 0.187. The stock has lost almost 30 per cent of its value this year.
The latest fall came amid heavy trading in Alitalia shares after a statement on Monday night from the board 
disclosed that the group had only Euros 72m (Dollars 60m) in cash at the end of July.
Although this represented an increase over the Euros 57m in cash held at the end of June, Alitalia said it was not 
enough to continue operations beyond the end of September.
The airline also said it had net debt of Euros 1.72bn at the end of July and expected its full-year loss in 2004 to be 
about as high as last year's loss of Euros 519m.
Alitalia's pilots' union complained yesterday that the company was issuing "irresponsible declarations" about 
potential insolvency.
"Apart from spreading concern among employees, passengers and public opinion, they are causing customers not 
to choose the Italian airline for their flights and are weighing heavily on the share price," the pilots' union said.
Some of the nine unions representing Alitalia's 22,000 employees say they suspected management was playing up 
the airline's difficulties to make them sign tougher contracts.
The airline, in which the Italian government holds a 62 per cent stake, says the unions must accept a recovery plan 
by September 15, or Alitalia will not take up a Euros 400m state-guaranteed loan approved by the European 
Commission.
Alitalia has 'one month'
The unions would like to see Italy's centre-right government intervene in the crisis, which they fear will otherwise 
result in the loss of thousands of jobs and the transformation of Alitalia into a "network carrier" - bigger than low-
cost airlines such as Ryanair but smaller than British Airways and Lufthansa.

EUJet, a new airline founded by a former Ryanair executive, said it had made its first flight from Dublin to the new 
Kent International in England.
The company said the route is the first of a number of destinations that will be introduced by the new low-cost 
airline over the coming weeks. 
The majority of these destinations will be serviced from EUJet's base in Shannon Airport and its UK hub in Kent. 
The airline today also began scheduled flights from Kent to Amsterdam, Girona, Nice and Copenhagen.
The owners of the Kent airport, Planestation, are 30pc shareholders in EUJet. Planestation is investing UK£6m in 
developing the airport and plans to build a new terminal and parking facilities.
 Speaking as he boarded the first flight P.J. McGoldrick, CEO of EUjet and former Ryanair execdutive said: "This is 
a very significant day for our fledgling airline. When establishing Eujet, we set out to create an offering that would 
meet consumer demands and I am pleased to say that initial interest in the airline has surpassed our expectations".

Leading London shares dipped into negative territory for the first time in seven sessions today as BA shares fell.
At the closing bell, the FTSE 100 index was down 30.80 points to 4,459.30.
The day's falling bluechip share prices were also inspired by a poor start to Wall Street trading after a pair of 
disappointing economic indicators.
 British Airways was the day's main faller after reports of disrupted flights over the UK's holiday weekend owing to 
staff shortages. Today saw further cancellations, including flights on its important London-New York route. Shares 
dropped 5p to 223.5. Among the mid-caps, Ryanair's main rival EasyJet fell 1.4pc after Panmure Gordon 
downgraded the stock to "sell" from "hold", setting a price target of 120p. The broker felt the competitive nature of 
the short haul market meant things were likely to get worse for EasyJet before they got better, with profits hit by 
average fare declines and higher fuel costs.

The International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) today launched an Internet campaign to "protect Ryanair 
workers' rights".
In what it called a "new kind of campaigning" the ITF has set up ryan-be-fair.org, a website that it says will give 
Ryanair staff the freedom to discuss their work, conditions and any problems they have as well as invite complaints 
and comments from the public.
The ITF said it acted after being told by some Ryanair workers that they were afraid that they might jeopardise their 
jobs if they were seen to be trying to assert their rights. "Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary is famously 
hostile to unions - the company refuses to recognise a trade union for its staff," the statement said.
 Ryanair responded this morning by saying that Ryanair staff are better paid than ITF members in other airlines. It 
said an average salary in Ryanair was E50,582 while ITF members in EasyJet are paid E41,384 and E34,386 in 
Virgin Express.

European stock markets gained yesterday after data showed an uptick in German business confidence, the price of 
oil dipped and the latest company results were seen as encouraging.
The FTSE Eurotop 300 index rose a further 0.9 per cent to 974.20.
Although encouraged by the market's resilience, traders cautioned that gains across most European markets were 
not accompanied by any great weight of buying interest and that sentiment could easily turn.
Airline stocks increased on the fall in oil prices, providing two of the best three performers in the FTSE Eurotop 300.
Germany's Lufthansa took second place, its shares gaining 4 per cent to Euros 9.91, followed by Ryanair, up 3.5 
per cent at Euros 4.40.
The automotive sector was among the top five sectors in the index with a gain of 1.4 per cent.
DaimlerChrysler shares advanced 1.9 per cent to Euros 34.76 on news that Japan's Mitsubishi Motors was 
loosening its ties with the company.
BMW was another winner, its stock adding 0.8 per cent to Euros 34.47 as Nomura, the stockbroker, commenced 
coverage with a "buy" recommendation and a fair value estimate of Euros 38-Euros 41.
Nomura said: "BMW's major product and market push, the largest in the history of the company, is beginning to 
deliver results.
"The outlook for volumes, revenues and earnings growth appears rosy on the back of new versions of the old 
staples and the addition of new model ranges.
"We believe BMW's earnings quality and sales growth prospects for the next three years deserve a premium to the 
sector."
German confidence sets the tone EUROPE:
Switzerland's Roche was the standard bearer for a buoyant pharmaceuticals arena, its shares climbing 2.2 per cent 
to SFr122.75 as the market responded to news that the group had filed for EU marketing approval for its lung 
cancer drug.
Drugs analysts estimate that the drug, one of Roche's blockbusters, could achieve sales of around Dollars 1.6bn by 
2009. Roche has already applied for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration.
Shares in French biotechnology stock NicOx soared 24.5 per cent to Euros 3.20 following a deal with US drugs 
colossus Pfizer, which grants the US company an option to acquire an exclusive worldwide licence for its specialist 
formulations of drug compounds.
The food retailing sector was one of only four sectors to lose ground, dragged lower by a dismal showing from 
Ahold. The Dutch retailer's shares plunged 6.8 per cent to Euros 5.31 in the wake of poorly received second quarter 
figures and the surprise resignation of its chairman, Karl Vuursteen, for personal reasons.
Barclays Private Clients said Ahold remained a company in transition, adding that the shares were likely to remain 
volatile over the next 12 months.
Deutsche Bank said: "The results suggest that our concerns over the sustainability of the food retail profits in the 
US were justified."
Fortis, the Benelux bancassurer, was among the star turns in the financial arena, its shares settling 1.3 per cent up 
at Euros 18.15 after the group unveiled consensus beating half year earnings and said it was more optimistic than 
at the start of the first quarter.
But results from two reinsurers, Swiss Re and Scor, failed to inspire the market. The former's shares settled 
unaltered at SFr72.10 while those of the latter dropped 0.9 per cent to Euros 1.17.
Swiss Re warned it might not be able to repeat the doubling of first half net income, while Scor's profits, although 
higher, failed to match market expectations.

The Dublin market powered ahead this morning as buyers returned to snap up banking, Elan and Ryanair stocks.
By 10:45, the ISEQ index of leading Irish shares was up 42.76 points to 5,440.24.
Muted trading with very low volumes was a feature of much of this and last week's trading. This morning, however, 
saw buyers return to the market in search of bargains with key heavyweights the focus of attention.
 Banks led the way with AIB shares up 5c to 1285 with a healthy 600,000 shares traded so far. Bank of Ireland 
gained 6c to 1086 with 129,000 shares changing hands. Anglo Irish rose by 7c to 1357 and Irish life & Permanent 
climbed 12c to 1237. Elan gave the rise much of its momentum with shares up almost 5pc or 79c to 1861 after a 
bout of profit taking in the last few sessions following the stock's meteoric rise last week. Construction stocks put in 
a poor performance and limited the index's rise. Sector leader, CRH was flat at 1865, Grafton fell by 5c to 700 and 
housebuilder McInerney inched up 3c to 563.

Eventually there comes a time whena company's core market can grow no further. The market has become 
saturated. Demand is still there, but it is flat or shrinking, and a number of companies are competing for a share of a 
market that is no longer expanding.
The share price begins to slip as investors seek better opportunities elsewhere. Senior managers grow worried as 
they seek ways out of the dilemma, and that concern channels itself down through the organisation and ultimately 
to customers. Eventually the company goes into decline.
There are three common methods for getting out of the saturation trap. The aggressive method is to compete 
intensively with rivals, maintaining growth by taking market share away from them. The acquisitive method is to buy 
up other companies or merge with them, thereby increasing growth via more peaceful means. The innovative 
method is to discover a way to break out of the market and create, in effect, a new market using a superior 
technology, product or service.
The aggressive method is seen in fast-moving consumer goods such as soap powder. Here, the overall market is 
growing slowly. There is a limit to the amount of soap powder that consumers in the US and Europe want to buy, 
which was reached some time ago (although there has been overall growth in other markets, notably China).
In fact, despite intense competition, overall market share has not changed much over the past two decades; some 
brands have risen while others have fallen, but the positions of the competitors remain more or less the same. In 
this case, the activity generated by competition has kept the companies lively and staved off their collapse.
The steady stream of acquisitions and mergers in the car industry over the past decade represents that sector's 
attempts to deal with saturation.
The ruthless have the edge: THE CORPORATE LIFE CYCLE SATURATION: Creative thinking combined with 
aggression can help ensure survival, says Morgen Witzel:
Again, although the world market has life left in it, market growth is not sufficient to achieve most companies' growth 
targets. Some industry experts believe that in 10 years' time there will only be three major carmakers in the world. 
Daimler's acquisition of Chrysler and Renault's merger with Nissan were moves towards this end; meanwhile, other 
companies such as Volvo and Jaguar have been swallowed up.
Innovating one's way out of the saturation trap is difficult, but the budget airlines have shown it can be done. A few 
years ago, few held any prospects for overall growth in the airline market. Then came Ryanair, EasyJet and so on, 
which suddenly pushed the market in a new direction. Unfortunately for the incumbent companies, they had 
difficulty in following the lead of the new entrants. Many large airlines founded budget subsidiaries, but not all of 
these were successful.
Some companies use a combination of two methods, or even all three. The mobile phone wars of the 1990s saw 
companies competing aggressively for market share, and even more aggressively on the stock market as each 
sought to buy out its rivals before it was itself bought. At the same time, they tried to develop new technologies, 
hoping that by offering a superior product they would both win customers and gain independence.
The lesson would seem to be that avoiding the saturation trap requires not only creativity and flexible thinking, but 
also a degree of ruthlessness. Those companies that survive are those that are prepared to move against their 
rivals - in one way or another. Tomorrow: Exits

Aer Lingus is thinking of leaving the eight-member international airline Oneworld alliance, according to a report this 
morning.
It is likely to announce the move as early as the next meeting of the alliance in three months time, the Irish Times 
says this morning, in an apparent leak.
The Irish flag carrier has been reinventing itself as a low fares carrier.
 The paper says that the state-owned airline feels its new strategy of targeting the budget market so lucratively 
mined by Ryanair is not compatible with the full service model offered by Oneworld's other members. It says that 
Aer Lingus chief executive Willie Walsh explained the airline's position to the rest of the alliance at a meeting four 
months ago. Oneworld is scheduled to meet again in November, and according to sources cited in this morning's 
report, Aer Lingus is likely to signal its intention to pull out of the group at that time. Membership of Oneworld would 
require Aer Lingus to maintain full service on all its routes. But the Irish flag carrier intends to eliminate business 
class seats from all flights to the UK and Europe by next April, but maintain them on transatlantic routes.

The British Air Line Pilots Association (BALPA) and their counterparts at the Irish Airline Pilots Association (IALPA) 
have reached a "ground-breaking" agreement in principle to work together to cover the organisation of pilots at Irish 
budget carrier Ryanair.
"I am delighted that IALPA and BALPA have recognised that the changing face of European aviation demands 
novel solutions such as this," says IALPA president Capt Evan Cullen.
The unions say the agreement is the culmination of eight months' work evolving a strategy to "effectively address 
the issue of representation across the new breed of pan-European airlines".
BALPA chairman Mervyn Granshaw says: "Over the next few weeks the detail will be communicated to existing and 
prospective members who we know from our research will be delighted to at last have their own voice."
The UK pilots' union has long battled to gain union recognition at the low-cost carrier, which is headquartered in 
Dublin but has operating bases across Europe, including its largest at London Stansted.

Body
The British Air Line Pilots Association (BALPA) and their counterparts at the Irish Airline Pilots Association (IALPA) 
have reached a "ground-breaking" agreement in principle to work together to cover the organisation of pilots at Irish 
budget carrier Ryanair.
"I am delighted that IALPA and BALPA have recognised that the changing face of European aviation demands 
novel solutions such as this," says IALPA president Capt Evan Cullen.
The unions say the agreement is the culmination of eight months' work evolving a strategy to "effectively address 
the issue of representation across the new breed of pan-European airlines".
BALPA chairman Mervyn Granshaw says: "Over the next few weeks the detail will be communicated to existing and 
prospective members who we know from our research will be delighted to at last have their own voice."
The UK pilots' union has long battled to gain union recognition at the low-cost carrier, which is headquartered in 
Dublin but has operating bases across Europe, including its largest at London Stansted.

As Michael O'Leary watched the tortured pay negotiations between British Airways and its unions this week, he was 
reminded why he has no truck with unions at Ryanair, the low-cost airline.
"How stupid do you have to be?" he asks, rhetorically.
To him, union demands for higher wages when airline profits are so fragile explains the sorry state of the airline 
industry.
When asked about the chances of success when Balpa, the British Air Line Pilots Association, gets its first chance 
in three years to canvass Ryanair pilots for recognition this autumn, he is characteristically succinct. "They'll lose."
It will be an interesting battle, however. Far from being the union haters epitomised by Mr O'Leary, many low-cost 
airlines are unionised, and have had relationships with organised labour that bear no resemblance to BA's bitter 
wrangling.
Chris Avery of JP Morgan says this is often because of loyalty bred by charismatic entrepreneurs, such as Stelios 
Haji-Ioannou of EasyJet and Richard Branson at Virgin Atlantic.
Even Southwest Airlines, the pioneer and role model of low-cost airlines, has let the unions in. As the US airline's 
success has grown over the past five years, it has conceded large pay settlements to pilots and flight attendants - 
traditionally the most productive workers in the industry.
Some say this has given it the trappings of its high-cost rivals.
In the UK, EasyJet, Ryanair's chief rival, has recognised unions for its 2,330 pilots and cabin crews, and some 
union representation arrived when it took over Go, BA's former no-frills arm.
Toby Nicol, spokesman for EasyJet, says the relationship has helped it borrow successful rostering practices that 
have worked for unions in other airlines. But he sees little likelihood of unions making outrageous demands. "The 
Low-cost airlines depend on loyalty
reality of operating a short-haul, low-cost airline is that if we make Pounds 2.50 a passenger, we're not giving you 
50p of that, and any reasonable group of pilots would agree," he says.
It took 73-year-old Herb Kelleher, the beloved founder of Southwest, to help resolve a flight attendants' pay dispute 
at Southwest this year. He had to be called in from retirement.
Whether O'Leary, famous for his sharp tongue, has the charm to keep his pilots on his side may well determine 
whether Ryanair remains union-free.

Highlight: Hundreds of  Ryanair pilots have boycotted meetings with the airline's  chief executive Michael O'Leary.
Body
Hundreds of Ryanair pilots have put themselves on a collision course with chief executive Michael O'Leary by 
boycotting meetings with him yesterday.
O'Leary called the meetings in London to urge the British-based pilots not to join the British Airline Pilots' 
Association.
The airline has sent letters to each of the absent pilots warning them of the consequences of their failure to attend 
the meetings.
 The letters, according to the Irish Times, say that their absence demonstrated "a lack of interest in developing their 
careers and securing promotion in Ryanair". Many of the airline's 600 pilots are known to have joined either BALPA 
or its Irish equivalent the Irish Airline Pilots' Association. The paper also reports that Ryanair's head of personnel in 
Dublin, David O'Brien, reacted angrily to the distribution of an information flyer compiled by IALPA and BALPA and 
had them removed from the pilot's pigeon holes. It says he subsequently wrote to all of its Irish pilots to warn them 
that this campaign "has already put your careers at risk yet again". The letter, it says, went on to threaten that the 
airline would refuse to train Dublin-based pilots, many of whom are senior captains, to fly its new Boeing 737-800 
fleet of aircraft and would bring in crews from Stansted to fly them. "This is not a rumour, it is now a fact," Mr 
O'Brien stated in the letter quoted by the paper.

The number of complaints about cancelled flights rose significantly over the past two years, driven by the growth of 
low-cost airlines, according to the latest annual report by the air travel watchdog.
The Air Transport Users Council said the number of written and telephone complaints it had received about flight 
cancellations rose by a third to 740 in the year to March 2004 and had more than doubled from two years ago.
Several of the larger no-frills carriers, which were not named in the report, had generated above average levels of 
complaints, according to the council.
"It appears likely that the rise in no-frills traffic is fuelling the surge in these complaints," the report said.
The council said the rise was a worrying trend and it would discuss the issue with the airlines.
Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, dismissed the findings as a "Noddy" report. It said the complaints 
equated to one for every 144,000 of its passengers and were not representative of its service.
EasyJet, Ryanair's low-cost rival, said it took the issue of flight cancellations "exceptionally seriously" and it was 
unfortunate that the council had not named the worst offenders in the list.
"To avoid being 'tarred with the same brush' as some of our competitors, it is worth noting that the EasyJet 
cancellation rate in the 12 months to March 2004 was 5.75 flights in every thousand," the airline said.
"British Airways by comparison in the same period cancelled 14.8 flights in every 1,000."
British Airways was again the most complained about airline. While the number of complaints against the British 
flag carrier, which has been beset by industrial disputes and is facing another strike, dipped from 257 to 252, it was 
still ahead of low-cost airlines EasyJet and Ryanair, which received 173 and 160 complaints respectively.
British Airways apologised to its customers who had complained but said the statistics had to be put into context.
Complaints about cancelled flights increase
The airline flew 36m passengers a year and also flew into some of the world's most congested airports.

Union officials and British Airways executives said progress was being made in talks to avert a damaging strike 
over pay by check-in staff and baggage handlers during the August bank holiday weekend.
But attempts by BA to link pay increases to better staff attendance were being resisted by the union negotiators 
when the talks were adjourned last night.
More than 11,000 BA members of the GMB and Transport and General Workers Union have voted to walk out 
during the busy weekend at airports across the UK.
Last night it was announced that baggage handlers and check-in staff at United Airlines based at Heathrow are also 
to stage a 24-hour strike over pay on August 27.
BA, Europe's second-largest airline, is under pressure to cut labour costs to stave off competition from low-cost 
carriers, such as Ryanair and EasyJet. Union officials have warned that the strike could cost BA Pounds 10m.
The airline improved its pay offer to workers earlier this week, adding a bonus of up to Pounds 1,000 for good 
attendance and an element of the wage increase backdated.
Ed Blisset, GMB spokesman for the aviation industry, speaking during a break in negotiations, said he was hopeful 
that both sides could reach an agreement.
"We are going to continue this evening to try to reach a resolution," he added.
The T&G said its negotiators were a lot more positive about a resolution but it was "a complete no-go" to link pay 
rises to absenteeism.
Rod Eddington, BA chief executive, warned in a memo to staff that low-cost rivals would "run us out of town" if the 
airline did not continue to enhance margins and reduce costs.
BA and unions see progress in pay row STRIKE THREAT:
"If we ease up now, we will lose ground to our competitors, and in the tough times that continue to confront us, that 
is something we simply cannot afford to do," he said.
The T&G has ordered its 8,325 BA members at six UK airports to strike for 24 hours from 4.30am on Friday August 
27. The GMB, which has 3,000 BA members, has promised a similar walkout.
BA has offered a bonus of up to Pounds 1,000 to workers absent for no more than 16 days in a two-year period. 
This is on top of an 8.5 per cent pay increase over three years.
BA fears a repeat of last summer's wildcat strike, which forced it to scrap 500 flights, disrupted travel for 100,000 
people and cost the airline Pounds 40m in lost sales.
BA's share price closed down 1.3 per cent at 213.75p.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said yesterday that the carrier would face an additional Euros 40m 
(Pounds 27m) in fuel costs over the next year if oil prices remained at current levels. 
Europe's biggest low-cost airline's fuel supply is currently hedged at about Dollars 28 a barrel to the end of October, 
Mr O'Leary said, but it would be forced to purchase fuel on the open market once the hedge expires.
In spite of the warning, Ryanair shares edged higher yesterday, rising about 1 per cent in London to Euros 4.30.

Body
Air France became the latest airline to pass the burden of soaring fuel costs on to customers, as it revealed plans to 
increase fuel surcharges by as much as Euros 12 (Dollars 15) for some flights.
The move follows a string of increases to air fares by carriers across the globe, as they battle with rising oil prices.
Air France, which introduced a Euros 3 fuel surcharge on all flights in May, yesterday said it would charge an 
additional Euros 2 per flight leg on domestic services and Euros 3 per leg on medium-haul services - to Europe and 
North Africa - as of August 24.
It said the surcharge on long-haul routes would increase by Euros 12 per flight leg, excluding routes to French 
Overseas Departments such as Cayenne and Reunion, which would be Euros 10 higher.
Air France's Dutch subsidiary, KLM, is also introducing a surcharge of an average Euros 3 as of September 1. This 
follows the airline's earlier decision to raise fares by up to 3 per cent, following a strong recovery in long-haul traffic.
Last week British Airways sparked a wave of increases as it more than doubled its fuel surcharge on 
intercontinental services.
Virgin Atlantic, BA's rival UK long-haul carrier, quickly followed suit with an identical increase and Lufthansa, the 
German national airline, said it would charge an extra Euros 2 for domestic and European routes and Euros 7 for 
long-haul travel.
Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific has also increased its fuel surcharge and Singapore Airlines is considering its 
position. However, low-cost airlines, Ryanair and EasyJet, have ruled out the introduction of surcharges as they 
expect further cuts to fares in the competitive European market.
Oil prices have risen by about 35 per cent since the start of the year, causing jet fuel prices to soar and threatening 
to leave the aviation industry in loss for a fourth successive year.
Air France is latest to to levy oil surcharge
Oil prices rose to a fresh high of Dollars 47 a barrel yesterday on heightened Middle East tensions.
Air France said the higher surcharges would be dropped as soon as the crude price returned to below Dollars 35 for 
more than 30 consecutive days.
The group's shares closed up 1.3 per cent yesterday at Euros 12.42.

Budget airline Ryanair today said if oil prices stay around their current high levels it could wipe up to E40m from 
annual profits. 
However, the group, which is hedged on oil price rises until October this year, reiterated there were no plans to 
introduce passenger fuel surcharges, unlike the recent moves by rival European operators.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary told reporters at a press conference that while the group was currently hedged 
against oil price increases, once this expired profits could be hit by around E40m a year. 
 However, he was adamant that the group would not impose fuel surcharges on its customers.

State owned transport company CIE has warned that its fuel costs will rise significantly in 2005 because of soaring 
world oil prices.
The company is currently forming a new panel to provide it with fuel hedging contracts. 
It is already completely hedged for 2004, but only has a small amount of its requirement hedged for 2005.
A spokesman told the Irish Times that there would be a "significant increase" in the price paid for oil in 2005 
compared to 2004.
 The company expects to spend about USD20m on fuel in 2004. Approximately 50pc of this is used by Irish Rail 
and the balance is shared by Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann. Aer Lingus recently decided to hedge its entire 2004 fuel 
requirements. Ryanair is also waiting for prices to fall so it can fully hedge itself for 2004.

Russian airlines are facing a pilot-shortage crisis because the number applying for jobs and training has plunged to 
a tenth of what it used to be and the industry is growing in size, according to a detailed study published in the 
Moscow Times. As a result, the average pilot age and the number of flying hours per crewmember are both rising 
rapidly, with low aircrew pay cited as the principal reason.
The average annual pay of a commercial pilot in Russia is $9,500. Oleg Prikhodko, the head of the Bashkirian 
Airlines pilot union, says: "Pilots are leaving airlines, and those who stay are treated like slaves." An airline captain 
identified only by the Moscow Times as Sergei says he moonlights as a taxi driver at the end of his rostered flying 
day for a domestic airline.
Miroslav Boichuk, president of the Cockpit Personnel Association, says: "If [industry growth] continues at such a 
pace, in two to three years we will not have enough pilots to meet demand."
Professional training in Russia, including for airline pilots, is still free to the trainees, but there are no longer queues 
outside the flying training school gates, the newspaper reports Valery Zaorov, head of the Sasovo flight school in 
Ryasan, 170km (105 miles) south east of Moscow, as saying. He adds that the number of trainees has fallen to a 
tenth of what it was in Soviet times, and that his school is training 25 pilots a year when it used to be training up to 
500. Pilots are leaving for foreign airlines including Ryanair, Korean Air and Vietnam Airlines, which all pay more -- 
some many times more. Despite this, says Zaorov, the airlines are reluctant to hire flying school graduates. 
Pridhoko alleges that, although Bashkirian does not demand its pilots work more than the statutory maximum 80 
flying hours a month, some airlines require them to fly up to 150h a month.

Meanwhile, another change may be looming. The government has proposed that the ministry of education should 
take over responsibility for professional as well as academic training, which has frightened the airlines and other 
industries. They fear this could bode the end of state-provided professional training because of budget priority 
changes the education department may bring, leaving industry or individuals facing the training costs directly.
 
Aeroflot studies school option

Aeroflot, which has had its pilot working practices recently checked and approved by transportation department 
inspectors, according to chief pilot Anatoly Yakimchuk, is now thinking of setting up its own pilot training school, 
because it always has to give training school graduates months of additional training anyway.
Russia's second largest airline Sibir has just hired 14 new pilots from regional carriers to replace the 19 it lost to 
airlines that pay better, the Moscow Times quotes its pilot union head Vladislav Bayev saying.

The frustration of flight delays has eased for travellers on many routes within Europe, new figures show. Members 
of the Association of European Airlines reported that the 18 per cent of departures delayed in June was the lowest 
proportion for the month in 10 years. 
For the second quarter the overall figure was 16 per cent, down from 16.6 per cent last year.
But the overall quarterly improvement conceals wide variations between airports. Delays increased at nine of 27 
airports covered by the statistics. Among those where punctuality decreased were Dublin, Vienna, Heathrow and 
Amsterdam. Those where things improved included Zurich, Rome, Madrid and Paris Charles de Gaulle. Dublin saw 
the highest proportion of departures held up at 24.7 per cent. The highest proportion of late arrivals was at 
Heathrow (22.8 per cent).
The AEA represents the region's mainstream carriers such as British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France. The low-
cost airlines, notably Ryanair and Easyjet, are not members. Hold-ups of less than 15 minutes are not counted as 
delays.
Including that buffer period, the longest average hold-up on departure during the quarter was the 50 minutes 
reported by carriers flying from Athens.

German Wings, the budget airline offshoot of Lufthansa, plans to run twice-daily flights from Dublin to Germany by 
next summer as a direct rival to Ryanair.
German Wings, which was established in 2002, recently overtook the controversial Irish carrier as the top low-cost 
airline in Germany.
The German operation has carried 30,000 passengers on its daily Dublin-Cologne route since February and will 
maintain up to four flights a week for the winter season.
 Deputy managing director Andreas Bierwirth told a Dublin press conference today that it plans to expand to two 
flights a day next summer as part of its growth strategy. "We will continue to fly into Cologne but will also open up a 
new route into Stuttgart. Ryanair is spending a lot on advertising in Germany but we are now carrying more 
passengers," he said. The firm employs 80 of its 400 employees at a call centre in Dublin. Ryanair already flies into 
its Frankfurt-Hahn hub from Shannon and Farranfore Airport in Co Kerry.

Recommendation follows Ryanair Stansted incident, when passengers left

Airport fire and rescue teams attending an incident should advise the flightcrew which aircraft exits are best for a 
passenger emergency evacuation, the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has recommended to the Civil 
Aviation Authority.
The AAIB's report on an emergency evacuation from a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 (EI-CSA) at London Stansted 
airport on 27 February 2002 reveals that some passengers began escaping via all the right-hand exits when the 
hazard was the engine on the same side emitting smoke.
The seven crew and 117 passengers all evacuated safely within 90s, but the pilots had turned the aircraft to a 
position that put the damaged engine upwind of the fuselage (see diagram).
In its report, the AAIB referred to the fatal 1985 British Airtours 737-200 accident during a take-off run at 
Manchester. In that incident, a left engine mechanical failure had caused a fierce wing fire, and although air traffic 
control had told the crew there was a fire in the left wing, they made a right exit from the runway before stopping, 
putting the fire upwind of the fuselage, which was rapidly engulfed in flames, killing 55 people.
In the Ryanair case, however, the crew had detected vibration in the right engine during the approach -- but it was 
indicated to be within limits -- and were not told about smoke from the engine until they had already made their 
runway exit.
Following airline standard operating procedures, the captain ordered the evacuation, but left it to the cabin crew to 
decide which exits to use, and they used them all. About 40 people left the aircraft on the side of the smouldering 
engine, and six began evacuation via the right overwing exits, but were told by the fire crews to re-enter the aircraft 
Fire crews 'should advise on exits'; Recommendation follows Ryanair Stansted incident, when passengers left 
737 on same side as smoking engine
and make their exits elsewhere. The cabin crew found some exits difficult to open because they were "armed" to 
deploy escape slides, which they found unfamiliar.
The technical problem causing the vibration and smoke -- but not actual fire -- was found to be failure of the 
engine's No 4 bearing, which the AAIB says is the unit most often subject to failure in CFM International CFM56 
engines.
 
Making evacuation safer
 
David Learmount
Air Accidents Investigation Branch recommendations say the UK Civil Aviation Authority should modify its guidance 
to air traffic controllers to require them to advise flightcrews of the surface wind whenever they tell the crew of an 
aircraft on the ground that it is showing signs of fire; require fire officers to advise the flightdeck crew of the need to 
evacuate the aircraft, and provide advice on the best exits to use; and "encourage" airports to deploy video 
equipment "to preserve best evidence in the event of an accident or incident". In addition, the Irish Aviation 
Authority and the European Joint Aviation Authorities should review initial and refresher training requirements for 
cabin crews.

Body
British Airways yesterday reported a near-quadrupling of operating profits for its first quarter, but warned that its fuel 
bill could jump by Pounds 225m to more than Pounds 1.1bn this year as a result of the surging oil price.
It confirmed that it would more than double its fuel surcharge on fares for long-haul flights from Pounds 2.50 to 
Pounds 6 per flight leg with effect from tomorrow to pass on some of the extra fuel costs to passengers.
BA's move as the first European airline to trigger higher fuel surcharges was quickly followed yesterday by Virgin 
Atlantic, the rival UK long-haul carrier, which announced an identical increase.
BA was forced to leave the fuel surcharge on its short-haul services unchanged, however, in the face of what Rod 
Eddington, BA chief executive, described as the "ferociously competitive" market in Europe.
Ryanair and EasyJet, the leading European low-cost carriers, ruled out the imposition of surcharges. Both have 
warned they expect fare levels to fall further in the coming months as a result of the price war in the European 
market.
Mr Eddington said he expected BA to remain lossmaking on its short-haul operations this year.
The airline disclosed it had greatly increased the hedging of its fuel requirements reflecting the belief that the oil 
price would remain high for some time. Mr Eddington said BA had hedged 72 per cent of its fuel requirements to 
March 2005 at Dollars 32 a barrel. It had hedged just over 30 per cent for the following nine months to the end of 
December 2005 and five per cent for 2006.
BA warns of surge in oil prices: Carrier reports near-quadrupling of operating profits: * Long-haul flight 
surcharge to be doubled: * Virgin Atlantic follows su....
The surcharge, introduced in May, would recoup about Pounds 70m of its Pounds 225m extra fuel costs in the 
financial year to March 2005.
In the first quarter, from April to June, BA exceeded market expectations by increasing its operating profits from 
Pounds 40m to Pounds 150m. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 115m compared with a loss of Pounds 45m a year 
ago. But its share price fell 3.5 per cent to 205 1/2p on investor concerns over the impact of the high oil price.
BA said it would hold a further meeting with European Commission officials later this week to press its case for 
intervention by Brussels in its dispute with the Italian government over long-haul fare levels in Italy.
The commission yesterday criticised the Italian move to force foreign airlines to raise many of their long-haul fares 
in the Italian market to the level charged by Alitalia, the state-owned Italian flag-carrier.
Brussels said the decision was "against the spirit of the internal market." Editorial Comment, Page 18 Lex, Page 20

Ikea's decision to charge customers 70p if they pay with credit cards will be an interesting test of consumer 
behaviour. Mudlark suspects it will be a watershed, not because other retailers will follow suit - competition will 
deter even those who contemplate it - but because it may be a tipping point in the shopper's love-hate relationship 
with Ikea.
A consumer's view of a brand is a bundle of perceptions, prejudices and loyalties, often conflicting. The mix is 
particularly ambivalent in relation to Ikea. Think of the range of emotions during a visit to one of its stores. "How can 
they afford to do something that looks so nice at that price?" Not by paying the producers Scandinavian wages and 
conditions, that is for certain. This, not an offshore call centre, is globalisation's shop window.
Leaving aside political thoughts, let us return to the Ikea experience. The long and winding path through the store - 
many sponsored walks for charity are shorter. The need to hump heavy flatpacks on to the trolley. Bollards 
positioned so that it's impossible to take the trolley to the car, meaning a solitary customer has to ask a stranger to 
watch his or her purchases while the car is fetched. Queueing in the car to find a place in the loading area. Making 
it all fit into the car. That is all before the delights of self-assembly.
The credit card surcharge might be the catalyst that mobilises these latent thoughts. Result? Fewer marginal visits, 
with former customers tempted to check out competing stores that they hadn't considered before. They also may 
resent having to pay 70p for the statutory protection that a credit card gives and other payment methods do not. 
Customers do not like feeling that a company holds them in contempt - which is why Mudlark wouldn't fly Ryanair at 
any fare - and Ikea may regret its step.

Aer Lingus has joined Ryanair in guaranteeing to customers that it will not introduce fuel surcharges as crude oil 
prices reach record levels.
The move comes after Ryanair yesterday said that it would not pass on the extra charge to customers and as 
British Airways and Virgin Atlantic in the UK said it would double its fuel surcharge rate charged on every ticket 
issued to UK£12 per journey.
Aer Lingus said the "vast majority" of its fuel was already hedged, but it decided in recent weeks to hedge 100pc of 
its requirement. The price it paid has not been disclosed.
 The airline said that half of its 2005 fuel costs are also hedged, with a small amount hedged in 2006. The airline 
said the rising prices would have an impact, but it would be limited as much as possible. Ryanair also pledged not 
to impose any fuel surcharges. "Our pledge to consumers is clear and unambiguous - the fare you pay is the fare 
you pay. Every Ryanair passenger can rest assured that Ryanair guarantees no fuel surcharges - not today, not 
tomorrow, not ever," said Mr Paul Fitzimmons, the airline's head of communications.

The fight for survival between Europe's national carriers and discount airlines took a new turn last week when the 
chief executive of Scandinavian Airlines System made an unprecedented foray into cyberspace to deflect the 
increasingly harsh criticism aimed at his company.
Jorgen Lindegaard, the feisty Dane who took the reins of SAS in 2001 and has yet to report a full-year profit, has a 
background in telecommunications and is no stranger to the gadgetry of the internet age.
Still, it was a surprise when he burst into the online chatroom of the Swedish business newspaper Dagens Industri 
with a spirited defence of his performance and personnel.
The trigger for his move was dozens of complaints from travellers, who, disgruntled by flight cancellations and 
SAS's decision to raise prices, vowed never again to fly with the airline.
Mr Lindegaard pulled no punches: "I've moved to Sweden and now use Ericsson mobile phones but that doesn't 
make me say 'never again Nokia'," he wrote.
"We have more than 35m customers travelling every year with the SAS group and don't tell me they do so because 
they have no other choice," Mr Lindegaard said.
Although the chief executive displayed an admirable ability to communicate with the chatroom complainers on their 
own colloquial level, his intervention will hardly quell the unease surrounding the airline.
SAS has had a difficult summer on several fronts and the interim results, to be released on Wednesday, are unlikely 
to brighten the picture. In late June, just a few weeks after declaring an optimistic aim to report a profit for 2004, 
price pressure from discount carriers, overcapacity and spiralling fuel costs forced SAS to downgrade its full-year 
outlook to negative.
SAS chief's online tirade does little to quell unease: And airline's interim results this week are unlikely offer any 
cheer, writes Clare MacCarthy
This shock was followed swiftly by another when SAS announced it would increase ticket prices out of Copenhagen 
by up to DKr400 (Dollars 66) each. Norwegian fares were also raised and the moves drew a caustic comment from 
SAS's bete noir - Ryanair.
"This just confirms our belief that one should never accept advice from SAS on how to run an airline," said Ryanair 
spokesman Paul Fitzsimmons. SAS, he added, "must be living in a dream world" to think fare increases were the 
way of the future.
Ryanair, which prides itself on a record of reliability, also grabbed the chance for a sideswipe at another of SAS's 
summertime woes - cancellations.
During July - high-season for Danish tourists - SAS announced an unprecedented level of flight cancellations. In 
one weekend in early July, upwards of 3,000 travellers arrived at the airport to find their flights had been cancelled.
SAS's excuse - that the cancellations were because of staff holidays - came as cold comfort for the thousands 
trapped in airport lounges for hours on end. Those staff present took the brunt of remonstrations from unhappy 
travellers.
And when the going got too rough to handle, the airline trade unions took out full-page advertisements in the Danish 
press appealing for public understanding.
"We're working as hard as we can" went the refrain, "but there's not enough of us". This plaintive appeal provided 
rare evidence that SAS's cutbacks and staff culls were starting to affect service.
The flight cancellations also raised questions about the airline's ability to plan: SAS's excuse - that the upset was 
caused by staff holidays and an extremely high number of travellers escaping an unusually wet Danish summer - 
rang hollow when it emerged that the company was aware of the shortfall in April.
But perhaps the greatest humiliation came when the Swedish government - which owns a 21.4 per cent stake in the 
airline - decreed that SAS should no longer be the airline of choice for state employees.
From now on, it said, civil servants flying between Stockholm and Gothenburg must opt for the discount airline Fly 
Me. Should tickets be unavailable, they should try Malmo Aviation, another low-cost carrier. SAS should be the last 
choice.
There was some relief last week, however, in the shape of new monthly traffic figures that showed a 9.2 per cent 
pick-up in passenger numbers in July, year-on-year.
But although general demand increased, analysts point out this could just as easily evaporate should high oil prices 
trigger another wave of fare increases.

Body
The European travel industry was lifted on two fronts yesterday when Ryanair reported increased first-quarter 
profits and Tui gave a positive assessment of trading in Germany, Europe's largest market.
There was also an upbeat message coming from Amadeus, the Madrid-based travel distribution company, which 
noted a strengthening in holiday and airline bookings.
The return of positive sentiment to the travel industry after three fallow years blighted by the September 11 2001 
attacks, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome and the war in Iraq, has been matched by similarly 
upbeat noises from the international hotel industry.
But while passenger volumes are up across Europe and travellers are returning to the skies and beaches, there are 
signs the travel industry is set for a period of fragmentation with package operators seen as the most likely to lose 
out.
Tui said summer holiday bookings from Germany had risen 2 per cent but analysts describe the increase as modest 
because the previous year had been exceptionally poor.
The depressed trading conditions were reflected in Tui's shares, which have declined since the beginning of the 
year. Europe's largest tour operator is now facing the ignominy of dropping out of the Dax, Frankfurt's main stock 
market index.
However, Tui will tomorrow release its half-year results a week early and has promised an improvement in profits. 
Like its rivals, Tui is under pressure because of the rise of of low-cost airlines and internet travel sites.
Ryanair is adding routes and increasing capacity, which is forcing Easyjet, its main rival, to expand in leisure 
markets traditionally dominated by package holiday operators.
Ryanair forecasts a rise of about 20 per cent in passenger volumes in the full year to March 2005, a slower rate 
than seen in the past two years, as it reins in its expansion to respond to overcapacity in the low-cost sector.
Ryanair and Tui boost Europe travel sector
"One way for Ryanair's competitors to ease the pain of price weakness in the low-cost market is to shift their

The tour operating sector struggles with even greater overcapacity. MyTravel recently said it would shed a third of 
its aircraft fleet and cut 500 jobs to bring it in line with demand. The solution for tour operators appears to lie in 
diversifying.

and offer holidaymakers an alternative to mass-market packages.
First Choice, the UK-based operator, is branching out into niche holiday markets and recently acquired Student-

Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, increased its pre-tax profit by 28.4 per cent in its first quarter from April to 
June.
It repeated its previous warnings, however, that its yields, or average fare levels, would fall sharply during the 
coming winter months and said more airlines would collapse in the face of overcapacity and price dumping.
The group's pre-tax profit for the quarter rose from Euros 45.1m to Euros 57.8m (Pounds 38.1m) on a turnover that 
increased by 23.5 per cent from Euros 245.2m to Euros 302.7m.
The airline, the most profitable in Europe, raised its net margin for the three months, normally its second strongest 
quarter, from 16.5 per cent to 17.4 per cent.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said yields had fallen by 6 per cent in the quarter.
He said yields were expected to show a fall of 5 to 10 per cent in the summer months from July to September, the 
group's most profitable quarter, followed by a much sharper fall of 10 to 20 per cent in the winter months.
The group makes up to 70 per cent of its profit between April and September.
Mr O'Leary said: "Chronically lossmaking competitors will continue to dump prices, resulting in even more airline 
casualties in the winter."
The airline said it had hedged almost all its fuel requirements until the end of September but was largely unhedged 
thereafter.
It said it believed that oil prices would fall in the medium term and that it would be "unwise" to hedge at the current 
high rates.
Mr O'Leary said: "It is in our interests for oil prices to go higher - it will take out our competitors. If it doubles, we are 
going to see the end of a lot of lossmaking airlines. If it doubles, we will be still squeaking a profit."
Ryanair lands a 28% advance TRANSPORT:
Ryanair renewed its attack on BAA, the UK airports group that controls the airline's most important base at London 
Stansted.
The two groups have recently started legal actions against each other with BAA seeking payment of about Pounds 
1m in alleged unpaid bills and Ryanair is seeking to recover an alleged overcharging of fuel levies.
Ryanair's share price fell by 8 cents, or 1.8 per cent, to close at Euros 4.32 yesterday.
The shares suffered a 31 per cent one-day collapse in January in response to the airline's first profit warning since 
flotation in 1997 and has struggled since to make up lost ground. Lex, Page 18

Airline executives are obsessive oil price watchers. This is hardly surprising; the oil price could make or break this 
year's industry profitability. 
The International Air Transport Association expects Dollars 3bn of industry profits this year based on an average oil 
price of Dollars 30 a barrel. An average of Dollars 33 would allow airlines to break even; Dollars 36 would translate 
into losses of Dollars 3bn.
Uncomfortable as the big picture is, some airlines are so far not too stressed. Ryanair, for example, remains almost 
fully hedged against the oil price rises, but only until the end of September. Michael O'Leary, chief executive, 
believes prices will fall over the next six to 12 months. His fuel bill could rise by Euros 25m, but Ryanair plans to 
compensate with cost cuts.
Many European airlines are in a similar position, with hedges in place for the next three to six months. The perilous 
state of US airline finances made hedging tricky, as a reasonable credit standing is needed to enter into derivative 
transactions. They are already feeling the oil price bite.
Mr O'Leary's oil price assumptions reflect the wider view on oil. But it is not crazy to imagine that the oil price could 
stick above Dollars 40. Supply is tight and the security picture remains risky. A demand shock is not yet on the 
cards. Airlines have underperformed the rest of the stock market due to oil cost worries and, if oil shows no signs of 
slipping in the next quarter, they may yet be in for a hairy ride.

City traffic is thinning, many offices are half-empty, but Europe's travel industry bosses cannot head for the beach. 
Others may be out enjoying themselves but, for the travel industry, still at its desk, almost every day brings another 
heat-induced headache.
Last week, MyTravel, the UK holiday company, said it would cut its 30- aircraft fleet by a third in an attempt to 
reduce its debt. Tui, Europe's largest travel group, said recent volatility in its share price was the result of hedge 
funds betting on its ejection from the Dax index this year.
As we report today, Club Med is attempting to stem years of decline by going up-market. In December, it will open 
the Riad in Marrakesh, the first of a new line of super-deluxe hotels, replacing its more basic resorts.
The same forces lie behind all these stories: the growth of low-cost airlines, the rise of the internet and travellers' 
increasing independence have damaged many traditional tour operators and travel agents. Travellers are arranging 
their own holidays, booking their flights with low-cost airlines and arranging their hotels on the internet - and often 
doing it more cheaply than they could if they booked through package tour companies.
Yesterday, Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-fares airline, announced it had increased its net profits by 29.7 per cent in 
the April to June quarter. However, the no-frills airlines face their own upheavals: Ryanair repeated warnings that its 
average fare levels would fall sharply during the winter as rival airlines cut prices. Few of the dozens of cut-price 
airlines that have sprung up in Europe are expected to survive.
What, in the midst of this turmoil, can travel companies do? They can adopt several strategies. First, like Club Med, 
they can attempt to go upmarket. For hotel operators, this is risky. Fixed costs in the luxury hotel business are high; 
the sector is vulnerable to a travel downturn of the sort that occurred after September 11.
The best-organised and most service-conscious travel agents could provide a service to the affluent. Travellers with 
plenty of money and little time will pay others to arrange their holidays. But, clearly, this sector will be big enough to 
accommodate only a few agencies.
Companies that want to remain in the middle market will have to offer something different. First Choice Holidays, 
the UK company, has already moved away from standard packages, concentrating on adventure breaks and exotic 
Summertime blues: The travel industry needs to rethink its role
destinations. Companies such as Mark Warner are trying to stay a step ahead by offering holidays where travellers 
need some help, such as snow-mobiling and dog-sledding. The problem is that today's exotic holiday is tomorrow's 
mass destination - one that tourists can book online.
For the rest of the industry, the future looks bleak. They may still be able to offer some beach holidays at prices 
cheaper than travellers can find themselves, but the profit margins will be desperately thin.

Budget carrier Ryanair today said it achieved passenger growth of 22pc last month, as it carried 2.48m passengers, 
up from 2.04m in the same month last year. 
In the rolling 12-month period to end-July, the low-cost airline carried 25.03m passengers. 
The load factor rose to 90pc in July this year from 85pc in the same month of 2003. 
The group sold 97pc of its tickets via the internet, up from 94pc last year.
 Yesterday, Ryanair reported pre-tax profit of E57.75m for the first quarter, an increase of 28pc on the 
corresponding period last year. Profit after tax came in at a record E53.1m, up 21pc on the year. This excluded the 
non-recurring costs of the re-organisation of Buzz in April 2003 of E2.7m and goodwill charges arising of E0.6m in 
both the quarters ended 30 June 2003 and 2004. Passenger volumes grew by a record 28pc to 6.6m passengers

Ryanair and UK airport operator BAA are locked in a wrangle over airport charging at London Stansted airport that 
has seen the two file law suits against each other.
Ryanair filed a suit against BAA alleging monopoly abuse of a dominant position over fuel levies.
BAA quickly responded with its own lawsuit to recover around [pounds sterling]1 million ($1.8 million) in 
aeronautical charges. The dispute centres on a fuel hydrant built in 1991 at a cost of [pounds sterling]12.5 million. 
BAA introduced a levy on carriers using London Stansted to pay for this.
Ryanair claims that BAA has recovered around [pounds sterling]34 million from this scheme, a fact that BAA hotly 
disputes. "The hydrant system has been paid for three times over and accordingly the fuel levy is a rip-off 
overcharge," says Ryanair. "Arising from this legal action, we anticipate a substantial reduction in the fuel levy in the 
order of [pounds sterling]4 million a year."
BAA is adding further pressure by informing Ryanair that it considers the airline to have reneged on its present 
discounted deal with the airport by not paying the full bill. The airline's current contract with BAA runs until

Body
Management at Aer Lingus have signalled their interest in participating in a privatisation of the airline, putting 
pressure on Dublin to move the Irish flag carrier out of the state sector.
The Aer Lingus management team has sought permission from the Irish government to "develop an investment 
proposal" for the carrier. Led by chief executive Willie Walsh, this team has turned the carrier around from near 
bankruptcy to profitability over the past three years.
The move has prompted Dublin to establish a cabinet-level subcommittee to consider the options facing Aer Lingus, 
with a decision expected by autumn. Dublin-based airline analysts point out that this does not necessarily mean a 
management buy-out. A key factor behind the management's proposal to take a lead on the sale, appears to be the 
desire to avoid a protracted, politicised privatisation process. Efforts to privatise national airport operator Aer Rianta, 
for example, have become bogged down, partly due to union and political issues.
"They may be taking the view that the right time for this will be sooner, rather than later," says one, adding that all 
options, from initial public offering to trade sale, are on the table.
The management proposal has prompted speculation about who else might be interested in the carrier. Rod 
Eddington, chief executive of oneworld alliance partner British Airways, has said that the UK carrier is not planning 
to bid as it is focusing on reducing debt levels.
In its European airline review, Citigroup Smith Barney speculates whether Lufthansa may be tempted to use some 
of the cash from its recent rights issue to buy into Aer Lingus. Even Ryanair cheekily suggested it might be 
interested.
However, Dublin analysts point out that political and strategic concerns will be high on the Irish government agenda. 
"They will want to ensure that the valuable London Heathrow slots are used for Irish services, and that direct 
transatlantic and European services remain," says one analyst. Ireland has benefited hugely from US investment in 
recent years. There is also the significant hurdle of bilateral restrictions to be overcome if the carrier is sold to non-
Irish interests.
Aer Lingus privatisation moves ahead.
At the end of July, the Aer Lingus board approved a three-year business plan for the company. Despite claims that 
the airline plans to cut over 1,000 more jobs from its 4,600-strong workforce, Aer Lingus has refused to comment on 
the plan. It statesonly that it is designed to provide:"the strategic, commercial and financial actions essential to 
ensure the continuing viability and growth of the business in the highly competitive, low-fares environment."

Ryanair, the leading European low-cost airline, is making its first tentative foray into eastern Europe and is 
broadening its attack on the Spanish market.
The group is launching three routes to Riga, the Latvian capital, from London Stansted, Frankfurt-Hahn and 
Tampere in Finland.
It is also opening routes between Stansted and Santander and Zaragoza in northern Spain and will fly to Santander 
from Rome Ciampino and Frankfurt-Hahn.
Low-cost airlines are moving rapidly to exploit the opportunities that have opened up in central and eastern Europe 
following the entry into the European Union of 10 new member states, mainly from the region, on May 1 but Ryanair 
had previously left the running to its rivals.
EasyJet, the UK low-cost carrier, announced recently that it was expanding its presence in eastern Europe with the 
addition of its first two destinations in Poland and further growth in Hungary.
It had previously limited its operations in the region to Prague until it opened routes in May from London Stansted to 
Ljubljana, Slovenia, and from London Luton to Budapest.
From the end of October, it will operate seven routes to Budapest and six to Prague.
From the end of October, it is opening routes linking Warsaw and Krakow in Poland to London Luton.
It is also opening a route between its latest German base at Dortmund to Krakow and is adding services between 
Budapest and Newcastle, Bristol and its Swiss base at Geneva.
The eight Ryanair routes announced yesterday will be launched from September 20 to December 1 and will bring 
its network to 161 routes across 17 countries, including 68 routes out of London Stansted, its main base.

Body
The board of Aer Lingus, the Irish state-owned airline, has approved a three-year business plan that is understood 
to call for the elimination of up to 1,300 more jobs by 2007.
The airline has staged a dramatic financial turnround in the last two years and has achieved the second-best 
operating profit margin in the European airline industry after its domestic rival, Ryanair.
However, Aer Lingus said yesterday that further strategic, commercial and financial actions were "essential to 
ensure the continuing viability and growth of the business in the highly competitive low-fares environment".
The Irish government is considering whether to privatise Aer Lingus following a recent approach by three leading 
executives of the airline led by Willie Walsh, chief executive, who have sought permission to prepare a proposal for 
a management buy-out.
The airline is owned 85.1 per cent by the Irish government and 14.9 per cent by staff.
The group refused yesterday to confirm the target for further job cuts but the Aer Lingus business plan immediately 
ran into opposition from trade unions.
"Our line is that we will resist job cuts, either compulsory or voluntary," a spokeswoman for SIPTU (Services, 
Industrial, Professional, Technical Union), Ireland's largest union, said yesterday. "There would be a huge range of 
options that we would be looking at before we would say yea or nay to 1,300 jobs going down the tubes."
Aer Lingus has already made big staff reductions since late 2001, when its survival was in doubt in the face of 
mounting losses triggered by the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US.
The number of employees has already fallen from 6,108 in 2001 to 4,281 in 2003.
The group has undergone one of the most radical restructuring efforts yet attempted by a European flag carrier, 
successfully cutting costs and lowering fares to compete with the no-frills operators, most importantly Ryanair, 
which operates in direct competition to Aer Lingus from Dublin.
Aer Lingus seeks further 1,300 job cuts
Aer Lingus has recovered from falling into a Euros 52.1m (Pounds 34.4m) operating loss in 2001 to making an 
operating profit of Euros 63.8m in 2002 and Euros 83m last year with a 9.3 per cent operating margin.
The board said that the group was "performing well" and was "on course to achieve its operating profit target of 
Euros 95m for 2004".
The cuts are expected to be made across the airline and will include pilots and cabin crew as Aer Lingus simplifies 
its operations and moves to a single aircraft type, the Airbus A320 family, on its short-haul network.

From Mr John Murphy.
Sir, As a resident of north-west Essex, can I just say how delighted I am to see Ryanair and BAA squabbling over 
landing and pipeline charges. 
We are being told that these two companies are going to be partners in a capital investment of up to Pounds 3bn 
building a second runway at Stansted airport. It seems they cannot even agree how to split a round of drinks.
Of course when it comes to the billions of pounds in supporting infrastructure, such as surface access, housing and 
social infrastructure for those who will work at the airport they are both remarkably silent at the moment. Like most 
civil engineering projects, if the final cost were known at the beginning of the exercise they would never have 
bothered. And the taxpayer can always be relied upon to chip in a few billion to help companies the government 
likes.
The fact is that aviation is an expensive business. They always say that the only way to make a small fortune from 
aviation is to start with a large fortune.
The recent boom in low-fare airlines is simply a bubble exploiting underused assets, mostly - like Stansted airport - 
built at taxpayer expense.
The government casually brushes aside the environmental damage that this explosion in aviation will cause, but 
one day someone will have to pick up the tab.
Is Gordon Brown going to tax the rest of us to subsidise a few people so they can visit their holiday homes in the 
sun more often? I hope not. But then it looks as if BAA is going to have problems getting its airline "partners" to 
stump up.

Ryanair may be searching for new ways of cutting costs and increasing revenues, but it moved swiftly to flush away 
rumours flying around the aviation industry that its latest wheeze was to have passengers seated in the aircraft 
toilets to add capacity.
It issued a statement yesterday confirming that two passengers - off-duty cabin crew returning to Ireland from a 
week's leave - travelled back on its flight FR7039 from Barcelona-Girona to Dublin last weekend in the rear toilets, 
because the flight was full.
The airline said the employees did so - in breach of the carrier's boarding and operating procedures - with the 
approval of the captain, a senior pilot with more than 30 years' flying experience.
The captain had tendered his resignation with immediate effect and the two cabin crew, who had refused to resign, 
had been dismissed for gross misconduct.
The Irish Aviation Authority, which regulates all Irish-registered aircraft, said it was conducting its own investigation 
after being alerted to the incident by a member of the public.
"We take this very seriously because of the safety implications," it said.
Ryanair said that it had conducted its own investigation for the past five days, and had co-operated fully with the 
IAA.
It said it operated "to the highest international standards" and any breaches would "be dealt with with the utmost 
speed and gravity".
As news of the incident spread in the airline community including across pprune.org, the website of the Professional 
Pilots Rumour Network, opinions varied among contributors on the gravity of the incident.
One suggested that the normal stampede to board a Ryanair flight would take on a new urgency with the command: 
"Quick with the boarding now, else you'll be sitting in the bog."
Off-duty crew sacked after sitting in toilet on packed flight
However, another contributor said: "Ryanair should be hammered for this. It is a gross breach of all international 
safety regulations and something akin to behaviour that existed in remote parts of Africa 20 years ago."
Ryanair's own recent ideas for cutting costs include aiming within a couple of years to ban passengers from 
checking in hold baggage with travellers to be restricted tocarry-on baggage only - it recently raised the maximum 
cabin baggage allowance - as a way of reducing costs at airports.
One contributor to the pprune.org website suggested that it could also provide a solution for excess passengers. 
"There will be plenty of room in the holds of Ryanair aircraft soon . . ."

Another day, another enemy. Michael O'Leary's latest foe is BAA, which operates British airports including 
Heathrow and Stansted. Ryanair is suing BAA over monopoly abuse of fuel levies, which cost the airline Pounds 
5m per year. 
BAA has countered by threatening to sue over Pounds 1.1m of charge increases it says Ryanair has refused to 
pay. BAA says contracts that give Ryanair a 50 per cent discount to published charges per passenger are now no 
longer valid. This is, of course, countered by Mr O'Leary. He says contracts are watertight until 2007, with charges 
fixed according to how long Ryanair has been operating a particular route.
The spats are a proxy for a broader battle. Mr O'Leary does not want to pay for an expensive expansion of 
Stansted. Ryanair is BAA's biggest customer at the airport, bringing it over 60 per cent of its passengers. But 
Stansted is also Ryanair's most important base - 40 per cent of Ryanair's passengers travel through it, although the 
Irish carrier is working to cut this to 20 per cent by 2007.
Whatever the legal outcome of these first rounds, a mudslinging match will do more damage to Ryanair than BAA in 
the short term. A tough year is forecast in the European low-cost sector as price wars precede consolidation, and 
investors are already worried about Ryanair's ability to keep cuttings costs. Mr O'Leary's case against expensive 
expansion is a compelling one. But by taking a characteristically aggressive stance, he risks not being heard in the 
din.

Michael O'Leary is going to war again.
With the mud of the campaigns against the "communist" officials of the European Commission and the iniquitous 
"high-fare" Air France at Strasbourg airport barely dried - the actions are currently locked in appeals - he is moving 
back into the field against a new target.
And this time it is BAA, the UK airports group and operator of his main base at London Stansted airport.
Fresh from filing a writ at the High Court in London yesterday against BAA for alleged "monopoly abuse" at 
Stansted, he warned that the action was only the first skirmish in what would become "the mother and father of a 
war".
His record in the courts of Europe to date is patchy at best - although he can justifiably argue that few of the most 
notable actions have yet run their course, and that he has only suffered defeats along the way towards the hoped-
for glorious victories in the final appeals.
The fight against the European Commission over alleged illegal subsidies at Charleroi airport is currently waiting a 
hearing before the European Court of First Instance.
The battle over illegal subsidies at Strasbourg airport, started by Brit Air, a subsidiary of Air France, is being 
contested in France, with a later move to the European courts not ruled out.
The latest locking of horns with BAA is focused on the apparently innocuous issue of fuel levies, imposed years ago 
by BAA at Stansted to pay for aircraft fuelling systems, and neither removed nor reduced since.
O'Leary locks horns with BAA in fight to end: Ryanair 's latest battle is focused on the apparently innocuous 
issue of fuel levies, reports Kevin Done
Ryanair's unpaid bills are running to nearly Pounds 1m. The airline is withholding some payments to try to force 
BAA to honour what it claims were undertakings to reduce the levies.
Ryanair alleged yesterday that BAA had already recovered Pounds 34m through the levies during 14 years for a 
facility that cost Pounds 12.5m.
BAA also yesterday filed a debt claim against Ryanair for Pounds 988,283 and Pounds 19,014.83 of interest - with 
the meter still ticking on the interest total. Ryanair issued its own claim against BAA, "alleging monopoly abuse of 
fuel levies".
Mr O'Leary made clear yesterday, however, that there is much more at stake. "This is just the start of it, get used to 
it. There is going to be lots more."
At stake later in the campaign are two big-ticket items for both companies. First is the renegotiation of Ryanair's 
deal on landing and passenger charges at Stansted, which is due to run out at the end of March 2007. And second 
is the huge issue of the expansion of Stansted airport, the building of a second runway and all the associated 
facilities.
The question is how much the bill will be for Stansted Generation 2 - and who will pay?
Ryanair is BAA's most important customer at Stansted. It accounts for 63 per cent or 12.5m of the airport's total of 
20m passengers a year.
It has a share of 52 per cent of all the used take-off and landing slots at Stansted. This is more than double its 
closest rival EasyJet, which accounts for 25 per cent of the passengers and 20 per cent of the slots.
By the same token, Stansted is by far the most important base in Ryanair's European network. It is its main access 
to the south-east of England, the richest aviation market in Europe.
Ryanair will fight to the end to keep its airport costs at Stansted to the lowest possible level. But as its routes and 
operations mature, the early wins from highly discounted deals are going to be more and more difficult to find.
At Stansted, Ryanair is believed to be paying about half the full tariff of Pounds 4.89 per passenger. But this is 
already rising in steps as part of its present six-year deal. And BAA has made clear that it intends to be charging 
airlines up to the full regulatory cap when the present low-cost deals unwind.
Mr O'Leary was on top form yesterday as he railed against BAA, describing them as "a bunch of overcharging 
rapists", and accusing them of building "marble palaces" at their airports and of installing an expensive "Noddy train 
set" at Stansted to move people instead of letting the passengers walk to the aircraft.
In the first fog of battle, investors took fright yesterday, with the Ryanair share price dropping by 5.1 per cent, or 25 
cents, to close at Euros 4.70. They are going to face many testing months ahead. Lex, Page 20
IRISH AIRLINE'S EXPANSION AT HOME OF EASYJET INCREASES COMPETITION WITH LOW-COST RIVAL
Ryanair took the first step yesterday towards reducing its dependence on BAA's London Stansted airport by 
announcing the expansion of operations at London Luton airport, the headquarters of EasyJet, its arch-rival, writes 
Kevin Done.
It has reached an agreement with TBI, the UK regional airports group that operates Luton, to locate another three 
aircraft and open nine more routes from Luton in addition to its existing services to Dublin and Milan/Bergamo. The 
Irish airline said the expansion at Luton would "create and sustain" more than 1,000 jobs in the area as it opened 
routes to Barcelona/Gerona and Barcelona/Reus and Murcia in Spain, Dinard and Nimes in France, Rome and 
Venice/Treviso in Italy, Esbjerg in Denmark, and Stockholm/Skavsta in Sweden. On some of the routes, it will be in 
head-to-head competition with EasyJet or will be operating to airports outside the main city. Mr O'Leary denied that 
O'Leary locks horns with BAA in fight to end: Ryanair 's latest battle is focused on the apparently innocuous 
issue of fuel levies, reports Kevin Done
Ryanair had any intention of pulling out of Stansted, its main London base, but said that its business there was 
"fully-grown" and that Stansted was already approaching capacity at peak hours. Confirmation that the low-cost 
airline expansion in Europe still has a long way to run came yesterday with BMIBaby's announcement that it would 
open a base at Birmingham airport with the launch of up to 20 routes, initially with three aircraft, starting from 
January. Investors are still backing the sector. SkyEurope Airlines, a recent entrant based in eastern Europe, said it 
had raised a further Euros 10m (Pounds 8.2m) in a placing with institutional investors in the UK and continental 
Europe. EasyJet is also adding more aircraft to its Luton and Berlin bases this winter.

Highlight: Ryanair is being probed over reports that staff had to sit on toilets on a flight from Spain to London.
Body
Budget carrier Ryanair is to be investigated after flying from Girona in Spain to London's Stansted airport earlier this 
week with people seated in the aircraft's toilets.
The incident was reported to the regulator following the flight. 
The airline has acknowledged that the flight was overcrowded and that it should not have happened.
A spokesman told the Irish Times that Ryanair did not overbook its flights and that it was taking the incident very 
seriously.
 It is understood that the passengers seated on the toilets for the duration of the flight were Ryanair staff. Other staff 
not on duty on the particular flight were sitting in jump-seats in the passenger cabin. The Irish Aviation Authority, 
which regulates the behaviour of all Irish-registered aircraft, confirmed last night that it had received a complaint 
from a passenger on the flight and had initiated an investigation.

BAA, the UK airports group, is today expected to sue Ryanair - Europe's leading low-cost airline and one of its most 
important customers - over the alleged non-payment of part of its aeronautical charges at London Stansted airport.
BAA is expected to issue a writ today in the High Court in London suing for the repayment of Pounds 1.1m that it 
alleges Ryanair has refused to pay, with some of the debt outstanding since the first half of last year.
Ryanair said last night that it was issuing its own proceedings against BAA for overcharging on fuel levies at 
Stansted over the past 12 years.
BAA's recourse to legal action follows Ryanair's failure to settle the debt by 4 pm yesterday, a deadline that had 
been set by the airports group.
BAA has further raised the stakes by informing Ryanair that it regards the airline's failure to settle the debt as a 
repudiation of its present contract with Stansted. As a result it maintains that Ryanair will still be able to use the 
airport but will forfeit its discount of about 50 per cent and will have to pay the airport's full tariff rate, in effect 
doubling its charges at the most important base in its European network.
Ryanair is by far the most important operator at Stansted, accounting for about 63 per cent or 12.5m of the 20m 
passengers who use the airport each year. It has about 52 per cent of all the used take-off and landing slots at 
Stansted - more than double its closest rival EasyJet.
The Irish carrier countered the threat of losing its discounts by declaring last night: "BAA is already aware our 
agreement is very specific and expires in 2007."
BAA to sue Ryanair over debt: Airports group claims carrier owes Pounds 1.1m for charges at Stansted: * Writ 
expected today: * Airline counter-suing over fuel l....
The row with BAA is the latest in a spate of legal actions involving Ryanair, including its dispute with the European 
Commission over illegal subsidies received at Charleroi airport in Belgium, and a disability discrimination suit over 
the level of wheelchair charges at Stansted.
The seriousness of the dispute underlines the scale of the problems that could lie ahead for BAA in dealing with its 
main customer at Stansted, where it has ambitious plans for expansion. This includes the controversial building of a 
second runway.
BAA has already made clear that landing and passenger charges will have to rise sharply to pay for the new 
infrastructure which has been estimated to cost about Pounds 2bn. BAA said Ryanair had been refusing to pay the 
increase of 50p per departing passenger that fell due from April 1 this year under the terms of its six-year 
agreement, which was due to run until March 2008.
BAA said Ryanair was refusing to pay the debts until the airports group reduced the levy on fuel that it charged the 
oil companies at Stansted, which they passed on to airlines.

A report by the Inspectorate of Constabulary suggests making it easier for business figures to parachute into senior 
ranks of the police force to improve its management and efficiency. However, secret pilot schemes with prominent 
business leaders have shown mixed results.
* Former Royal Dutch/Shell chiefs Philip Watts and Walter van de Vijver took charge of an established force. Early 
results proved extremely exciting but there is now concern the clear-up rate might have been exaggerated.
* Local opinion turned against Sir Peter Davis, late of J Sainsbury, when it emerged that he was being paid a huge 
bonus even though the murder rate had soared.
* By contrast, Tesco's Sir Terry Leahy proved popular with Londoners who admired his no-nonsense approach to 
policing and nicknamed him "Robocop". However, his cheese-paring hit morale within the force. The sale of New 
Scotland Yard and relocation to a business park angered senior officers while beat cops raged at new rules 
requiring officers killed in the line of duty to produce a coroner's certificate before they were given time off.
* Former BA chairman Lord Marshall looked like being the success story of the scheme but after a number of good 
months he alienated the public by replacing the traditional uniforms with new multicultural designs.
* Ryanair's Michael O'Leary ran a very tidy operation impressing many with his no-frills approach. But there was 
irritation with his insistence on charging extra for crimes committed at weekends. Some complained the service was 
fine if you were mugged in a rural district on a Monday morning, but of little value to those robbed on Friday evening 
after the pubs closed.
* Sir Richard Branson proved highly innovative, breaking up his force into a variety of squads, rebranding them 
Virgin Murder, Virgin Robbery and so on. He also diversified, offering police cola and financial services. Many were 
impressed by the hands-on approach which ensured he was always present with photographers at major arrests.
* There was great unease about the squads given to the split capital investment trusts. These initially showed 
spectacular results, but it turned out that they were simply sending each other their criminals at annual report time.
Doing the business for the police NOTEBOOK - ROBERT SHRIMSLEY
* Sir Clive Thompson, late of Rentokil, delivered dramatic cost savings. Then it emerged that there was no 
investment in new equipment and the armed response unit was still using truncheons.
* Philip Green and Stuart Rose ran neighbouring forces very well but fell out when Mr Green demanded control of 
both constabularies.

Body
Ryanair today announced a major expansion of its London Luton base with an investment of USD240m in four new 
Boeing 737-800 series aircraft and nine new European routes from London Luton.
The new routes will be to Barcelona (Girona), Esjberg, Rome, Barcelona (Reus), Murcia, Stockholm, Dinard, Nimes 
and Venice.
Ryanair, which began services at London Luton in 1986, already operates 14 daily international flights from Luton to 
Dublin and Milan, and this year will carry 1.6m passengers to/from Luton.
 Announcing this expansion of its Luton base today, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said, "Consumers 
using London Luton airport now have a real low fares airline offering fares that are half the price of Easyjet, serving 
11 destinations throughout Europe and delivering unbeatable punctuality, and that's Ryanair."

Highlight: Ryanair has a suit against BAA alleging abuse of monopoly at Stansted airport.
Body
Ryanair today announced that it filed documents this morning at the High Court in London alleging monopoly abuse 
of fuel levies by BAA, dominant operators of London airports and owners of London Stansted airport. 
BAA at Stansted built a fuel hydrant system in 1991 at a cost of UK£12.5m. BAA introduced a fuel levy charge, 
which was designed to recoup this cost. 
Since then, BAA has given repeated undertakings in writing that this levy will be eliminated when the capital costs 
were recovered, Ryanair claimed. 
According to the budget carrier, BAA has broken these agreements and to date BAA Stansted has, in a 14 year 
period, recovered over £34m in fuel levies, three times the original cost. "Ryanair has a long history of opposing anti 
consumer charges by dominant or monopoly airports. If there was competition between the three BAA owned 
London airports, this fuel levy scam would not exist," Ryanair said. "We look forward to the courts ending this price 
gouging by a dominant airport operator on both low fare airlines and their passengers," it added.

Body
UK airports operator BAA today said it is suing no-frills airline Ryanair over UK£1m of allegedly unpaid aeronautical 
charges at Stansted airport. A writ will be issued in the high court on Thursday morning.
"It's a matter we've been trying to settle amicably for a number of weeks and we gave Ryanair a deadline of today 
to pay the unpaid bills. That has passed," a spokeswoman for BAA said. 
BAA has also written to Ryanair to inform the airline it regards it as having "repudiated their contract with Stansted 
airport". 
 The spokeswoman said this means that although Ryanair can continue to operate from Stansted as normal, it will 
no longer enjoy any of its current discounts on aeronautical fees. She noted that BAA's current yield across all the 
airlines it serves at Stansted is about £2.80 per passenger, while the regulatory cap of charges is £4.89. "So when 
we say that Ryanair will no longer enjoy current discounts that gives a picture of what we are doing." Ryanair has 
about 12.5m passengers a year travelling through Stansted.

The growing low-cost airline sector is expected to spark a fight for survival among carriers in Europe this winter that 
is widely expected to result in a bloodbath.
This dire prediction is not new: Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline based 
on passenger numbers, predicted the fall-out as early as January, after the Irish-based carrier issued its first profits 
warning since flotation in 1997.
November, January and February in particular are when the airline industry experiences its slowest trading period 
and is the prime time for carriers to go under.
A shake-out is looming in Europe with the most likely victims among the rapidly growing band of new low-cost 
entrants - although some traditional airlines, such as Alitalia and Swiss, may be vulnerable.
The first signs of how harsh the price war is going to be this winter in the northern hemisphere came in early July 
when Ryanair announced its biggest sales promotion for winter in its main market, the UK, offering 1m seats for 99p 
before charges and taxes.
Mr O'Leary repeated his forecast that Ryanair's average fare will drop by up to 20 per cent in the low season as 
competition bites.
Investors knocked the shine off Ryanair's shares before they sank their teeth into arch rival EasyJet in June. The 
Luton-based airline has had a rough time of late, after management mis-read the impact of the fare war and was 
forced to issue two profits warnings in a month.
But Europe's big two have deep enough pockets to survive the winter bloodletting. It is the pretenders that are 
expected to falter. It is estimated that more than 50 low-cost carriers are flying around the skies of Europe. A few 
have already faded to be replaced by another potential new entrant looking for backers.
Winter lull could see fight for survival LOW-COST AIRLINES: As more start-up airlines enter the market, too 
much capacity is chasing too little demand, reports ....
The low-cost airline trend is gathering pace in Asia-Pacific, in spite of remaining a largely regulated market. Sir 
Richard Branson may have struggled to make a go of it in Europe with his Virgin Express problem child, but the 
British entrepreneur has earned around ADollars 800m from Virgin Blue, the highly successful Australian venture 
set up four years ago.
Sir Richard's success with Virgin Blue - the secret was in large part in the timing, catching Ansett, the only domestic 
competitor to flag carrier Qantas, at its weakest and accelerating its collapse - has encouraged other ventures 
elsewhere.
Air Asia, run by Tony Fernandes, a former music industry executive from Malaysia, was the first to pick up the baton 
but other start-ups are waiting in the wings. Singapore is busy spawning wannabee low-fare startups with at least 
three ventures in the pipeline, including Tiger Airways, backed by Ireland's Ryan family, who founded Ryanair, 
David Bonderman, the US airline financier and the Singapore government.
Qantas started its own domestic low-cost operation at the end of May to counter the threat of Virgin Blue in 
Australia.
In the US - birthplace of the low-cost carrier in the form of Southwest Airlines in the 1970s - a second wave of start-
ups is threatening to undermine the recovery of the traditional hub and spoke carriers, such as United Airlines and 
US Airways, from the worst industry recession in history.
Market penetration of the low-cost airlines domestically in the US has accelerated rapidly. Data from Airline Monitor, 
a US magazine that compiles airline industry statistics, show that low-cost airlines accounted for just 5 per cent of 
the US market in 1987.
Market share rose to 12 per cent by 1992, during the last airline industry downturn, but has now more than doubled 
to 25 per cent.
Three developments have allowed start-ups, such as the highly successful JetBlue, to hammer mainline opponents. 
First, the internet has vastly increased pricing transparency for consumers and provided start-ups with a ready-
made distribution vehicle. Distribution was previously controlled by the industry.
Second, legacy carriers, such as United, became complacent during the boom years of the late 1990s and early 
2000s and allowed costs to spiral out of control. Third, the scale of the recession, after the September 11 attacks in 
2001, was so severe that those same airlines could only focus on internal firefighting or risk complete collapse.
This rapid spread around the globe of the low-cost carrier trend should benefit consumers, but it is not all good 
news for travellers.
The experience in Europe, where too much capacity is chasing too little demand, has already resulted in the 
collapse of a number of start-ups, leaving thousands of passengers clutching useless tickets.
With warnings of worse to come, those travellers looking to snap up the inevitable bargain fares would do well to 
choose their airline carefully.

 (ANSA) - Falconara Marittima, July 19 - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will launch winter-schedule flights between 
Ancona, the capital city of the central Italian region of the Marches, and London, at a price of 0. 99 euro ($ 1. 2), 
airport tariffs excluded, said Peter Sherrard, a marketing and sales director of Ryanair for Italy.
A total 500, 000 passengers were registered on the Ancona-London route in five years. Ryanair has been operating 
in the Marches since July 1999. The average number of passengers to London stands at 100, 000 annually. A 38 
pct year-on-year rise was witnessed in passengers to London in June 2004. (Alternative/Original name: Marche) 
(ANSA).
Ryanair plans to increase the number of passengers transported from and to Italy to 15 million by 2008. The carrier 
expects to serve 7. 5 million passengers from and to Italy in 2004.

EasyJet shares fell to an all-time low yesterday as investors digested news that Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder 
and former chairman, had "no current plan" to take the leading UK low-cost airline private.
However, analysts emphasised that Mr Haji-Ioannou's statement, made in a letter to Sir Colin Chandler, chairman, 
and released late on Friday, had left the door open to a bid at a later stage.
"He neatly leaves room for a change of mind if the share price moves materially," said Chris Avery, aviation analyst 
at JP Morgan. "I am not sure he is ruling much in or ruling much out."
EasyJet shares closed 6 1/2p, or 4 per cent lower, at 143 1/2p yesterday, the first opportunity investors have had to 
trade since the statement was made.
The EasyJet management has been under heavy pressure since early June, when it triggered a second profit 
downgrade in a month in the face of an unrelenting price war in short-haul markets in Europe. The share price 
plunge has prompted speculation that Mr Haji-Ioannou could intervene.
But, in his letter to Sir Colin, Mr Haji-Ioannou's successor as EasyJet chairman, the entrepreneur said "taking 
EasyJet private at this stage would, in my view, be something of an extreme measure. There are many other steps 
that could be considered before going private." He warned, however, that if there were a further deterioration in the 
share price he would "be free to a take a different line".
The airline was floated in November 2000 at 310p and reached a peak of 503p in March 2002. The market 
capitalisation peaked at Pounds 1.66bn, but has since lost two-thirds of its value and stood last night at Pounds 
573m.
EasyJet's market value has fallen to a quarter of Ryanair, its Irish rival, even though the two airlines are similar in 
size measured by the number of passengers they carry. In the 12 months to the end of June, EasyJet carried 22.9m 
passengers compared with Ryanair's 24.6m. On current financial year forecasts EasyJet is trading on an underlying 
p/e of 11.6, compared with 17 at Ryanair.

EasyJet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou says he has no current plan to take the company private, but has left the door 
open for this eventuality if the firm's share price continues to fall. 
The major shareholder said today that buying out EasyJet would be an extreme measure at this stage, but he kept 
his investment in the company under review, with all sensible options considered from time to time. 
"While we will continue to support the board at this time, if there were a further deterioration in the share price, 
deviations from what we understand to be the board's plans to improve shareholder value or other material changes 
in circumstances, we would obviously be free to take a different line," he said in a statement. 
 Last week, EasyGroup confirmed that Haji-Ioannou was considering taking the airline private but said no final 
decision had been reached. EasyJet shares fell sharply in June after it warned that 2004 pre-tax profits were likely 
to be below earlier forecasts, due to high oil prices and the price war with fellow budget airline Ryanair. The stock 
has halved in value since the beginning of the year.

BAA, the operator of the UK's largest airports, reported brisk trade at most of its terminals as passenger numbers in 
June rose by 7 per cent to 12.8m compared with last year's figures.
The group also revealed that the important north Atlantic market, which had been hit by the war in Iraq and the 
global economic downturn, seemed to be showing signs of recovery as passengers increased by 8.2 per cent.
The results echoed improved trading from British Airways and Ryanair, which this week both reported higher 
passenger numbers during June. Other long-haul destinations saw traffic rise by 17.8 per cent while European 
scheduled passengers increased by 9.6 per cent. This and the growth in domestic traffic offset a 6 per cent decline 
from short-haul charters.
Air cargo activity showed strong signs of recovery, shadowing the upturn in sea cargo, as tonnage rose by 7.4 per 
cent.
Stansted, the home of the low-cost operators, continued to be the fastest growing London airport, increasing 
passenger numbers by 10.7 per cent.
More than 20m passengers now pass through the airport annually.
But the longer term growth of Stansted might stall following a potential challenge in the High Court to the Pounds 
2bn construction of a second runway and terminal building.
Heathrow, which is also having its expansion plans challenged, reported a7 per cent rise in passenger numbers. 
Gatwick was up by 5.1 per cent.
In total, BAA's seven UK airports handled 36m passengers in the first quarter of the financial year, a 9.7 per cent

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, is aiming to ban passengers from checking baggage into the hold 
within a couple of years in the next stage of his campaign to cut costs at Europe's largest no-frills airline.
Mr O'Leary is also pressing ahead with plans to introduce paid-for, seat-back in-flight entertainment for next year's 
summer season ranging from cartoons to sitcoms, sports footage and films in order to develop a new stream of 
revenues.
Mr O'Leary admitted yesterday that the less difficult moves to cuts costs - which range from taking bookings over 
the internet to operating to and from secondary and regional airports - had already been exploited.
"Now we must be cleverer," he said.
The need to reduce costs further to support lower fares has been highlighted in recent months by the intensifying 
fare war being waged on European short-haul routes. Mr O'Leary turned up the heat again yesterday by 
announcing the airline's biggest discounted seat promotion with a million seats selling at 99p, excluding taxes and 
charges, for the coming winter season.
Mr O'Leary said the latest discounted fare offer was not an act of desperation. He argued that it was "better to 
reduce profits and sell at lower prices for a couple of years" to consolidate market share.
Ryanair has been punished by investors, since it issued its first profits warning in January. Its share price has fallen 
sharply from a January peak of Euros 7.59 and closed last night two cents higher at Euros 4.67.
The Ryanair vision of the next wave of cost-cutting is centred on simplifying its airport operations.
"The objective is to get rid of hold baggage altogether," said Mr O'Leary, with passengers being restricted to 
travelling with carry-on baggage only.
Within two to three years, the airline could cut its airport costs by a third or Euros 75m (Pounds 50m).
 Ryanair announces plan to ban checked-in baggage TRANSPORT:
"We could take Pounds 5 per passenger out of costs," he said, and design much more efficient, low-cost airports.
Mr O'Leary acknowledged that it would take time to persuade passengers to reduce their luggage requirements but 
said the airline had already taken a step in this direction by raising the maximum cabin baggage allowance from 
seven to 10kgs and by raising excess baggage charges.
Mr O'Leary said the next step in the campaign could be afurther increase in excess baggage charges and the offer 
of a Pounds 5 incentive refund to passengers checking in with only hand baggage.
In theory, Ryanair could charge Pounds 50 for the first suitcase, Pounds 100 for the second and Pounds 5,000 for 
the third, he said.
Already fewer than 50 per cent of Ryanair passengers had check-in baggage, he said, and the average stay was a 
little more than two days.

EasyJet passenger volumes in June rose by 28 per cent year-on-year in line with the low-cost airline's increase in 
capacity.
The group, whose share price has fallen sharply in recent weeks in the wake of two profit warnings, said it had sold 
84 per cent of its seats, a level unchanged on a year ago.
Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst at ABN Amro, said that the "actual traffic data are fine, but the unit revenue 
situation is deteriorating, fully consistent with the most recent profit warning".
He said positive developments in ancillary revenues, such as commissions earned on hotel, insurance or car 
rentals, probably masked a weaker trend in fares.
Ryanair, the rival Irish carrier whose share price has also plunged after a profit warning, previously reported a 24

Planestation Group is looking for a partner to help develop Kent International Airport at Manston.
Martin May, who took over as chief executive of the airport and property group in March, believes the airport can be 
developed as a small hub in south-east England. "It will never have 22m passengers a year but we will make 
money at 2m passengers a year and increase the value of our surrounding land."
He is planning to generate passenger traffic between Kent and the group's airports near Orlando in Florida and in 
Germany's Black Forest. Its other German airport, near Schwerin, is one of only two in the country with a runway 
wide enough for the new Airbus 380.
In May, the group paid Pounds 2m for 30 per cent of EU-JetOps, the Irish airline run by PJ McGoldrick, former 
Ryanair chief executive.
Planestation also reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 17m on turnover of Pounds 12.3m in the year to March 31. That 
compares with a Pounds 12.8m loss on turnover of Pounds 39.8m in the year to March 2003 under the previous 
management.
Michael Iny, Mr May's ousted predecessor, and Geoffrey Lansbury, the property director, have been asked to 
resign and formal steps are under way to remove them from the board, probably at an extraordinary meeting before 
the annual meeting next month. The cost of the board is expected to be 49 per cent lower this year.
Mr May has reviewed the group's main assets. He said anything non-core would be sold or be subject to revised 
negotiations. For example, plans to build a racecourse on its 345-acre site in the London borough of Redbridge, 
turned down by planning authorities on the grounds of scale, had been revised and resubmitted.
The group is virtually debt free after a Pounds 27m rescue rights issue at the start of the year at 4p and a further 
placing at 5.4p to raise Pounds 5.6m in May. The shares closed at 6.07p, down 0.48p. The loss per share was 
1.34p (1.3p loss). There is no dividend.

Tired of fatigue myths
Any excitement at the title or introduction to your editorial on fatigue ("Tired of fatigue", Flight International, 15-21 
June) soon dissipated when we realised that you, too, had been taken in by the operator-led myth that there is not 
much scientific data and little consensus where it does exist. In the UK and elsewhere we have been conducting 
trials and collating data since the Bader report of 1973. In addition, there is enormous consensus not only between 
the various scientific organisations within the European Committee on Aircrew Scheduling and Safety and the 
European Transport Safety Council, but from similar bodies as far afield as New Zealand. In 2001, the Defence 
Evaluation and Research Agency (now Qinetiq) and the UK Civil Aviation Authority produced fatigue avoidance 
software, SAFE, which drew upon much of this science.
Such guidance is of no interest to a minority of airlines. These are the same airlines that are least likely to recognise 
pilot unions, or to follow the inconvenient minutiae of industrial agreements. When dealing with their national 
authorities they are also the most likely to assert any literal reading of regulations that suits their commercial 
purposes.
In the same issue, Michael O'Leary of Ryanair, above the report of an accident in which fatigue is cited as an 
important factor, tells us that rules designed to minimise the impact of fatigue will serve to "limit flexibility" for the 
"most cosseted group of employees in the world". Is Mr O'Leary not persuasively making the case for caution and 
reflection when we ponder upon the matter of flight duty time regulations?

Cheaper than an accident
Letter
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, says the new European Union flightcrew duty time limitations (FCDT) 
will further limit flexibility of the "most cosseted group of employees in the world" (Flight International, 15-21 June).
Mr O'Leary's intemperate comments no doubt reflect, to a large degree, his frustration in presiding over a company 
where commercial fortune is presently on the wane.
Ironically, it is also a quintessential example of the need for the regulator to prescribe FCDT limitations. These 
minimum standards are necessary to protect the safety of crew, passengers and company assets in organisations 
with inadequate safety management systems and an immature corporate safety culture. Without regulatory 
intervention, corporate impatience for short-term commercial success and shareholder approval would almost 
certainly lead to flightcrew roster abuse.
It is not that pilots are cosseted; the question that the industry, shareholders and the public should be askingis why 
other safety-critical employees are not also protected by duty time limitations.
Safety may be expensive, but what the accountants appear not to have told Mr O'Leary is that it will always be 
cheaper than having an accident.

Flawed flight display?
In your report (Flight International, 15-21 June) of the Airbus A340 incident at Johannesburg, you say that "the 
sidestick position indicator has two functions -- for preflight control checks and to monitor sidestick input during 
take-off roll".
You later report that in its flight operations telex, Airbus reminds operators that the [sidestick controller] symbol "was 
not designed to be used during take-off rotation".
Before blaming the pilot or training, isn't this a basic flaw in the display philosophy of the primary flight display? If 
the pilot is required to monitor sidestick position indicator during take off roll only, shouldn't the indicator be 
automatically inhibited closer to rotation, say at V1? This is the time when the pilot must not use it for rotation and 
may very well be confused by its mere presence.
The pilot should not be distracted by unnecessary information at a critical phase of flight.
Omar Husseini, Alsalam Aircraft, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
 
Blunder or bad design?
The Emirates Airbus A340-300 take-off incident (Flight International, 15-21 June) looks like a human error -- or so 
the Airbus statement would have us believe.
But what if this is another example of a design problem? Ambiguously designed instruments have featured in 
accidents before. Anecdotal evidence suggests such errors are only known about when they have to be reported 
via an event -- until then the problem is invisible -- as it was with computer mode settings when the Airbus A320 
entered service.
The Emirates incident may be an ergonomic interface error -- the design of the A340 primary flight display sees the 
brightly coloured, centrally focused sidestick position indicator dominate the instrument -- until it disappears on 
leaving the ground: the crucial aircraft pitch indicator symbol is a neutral colour that is the same colour as the 
background display (black), and is only marked at the periphery of the user's visual assimilation field.
In flight, the aircraft indicator is obvious by default, but throw in the more visually dominant ground activated 
sidestick marker and the picture clouds. I suggest Airbus change the display -- make the aircraft attitude marker a 
Letter
brighter colour. As for its statement that pilots should use external visual references -- what do you do in fog, and 
what are instruments for?

Past pointers
Your analysis of the US National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) recommendation on the American Airlines 
AA587 Airbus A300-600 accident is a case of looking to the past to point to the future (Flight International, 8-14 
June).
The separation of an American Airlines A300-600 incident over Florida in 1997 and the 2001 AA587 crash is one of 
luck. The rudder travel limiter or "variable stop" is a "fixed-ratio system", meaning that the travel of the rudder and 
its pedal are chopped by fixed amounts as the speed increases up to Vmo. This has been used on Boeing and 
McDonnell Douglas aircraft.
But the difference between those aircraft and Airbus types is that they have a much larger "breakout force" -- the 
amount of pedal force required to move the rudder and subsequent incremental force for full deflection. This 
equates, for AA587, to a 10kg (22lb) breakout, with 4.4kg incremental force for full travel. Each force is sensitive 
enough in isolation, but when combined with reduced pedal travel it is tailor-made for "stop to stop" overcontrol.
On the similarly sized fixed-ratio DC-10/MD-11, 50mm (2in) of travel and 30kg of muscle is required to achieve full 
deflection at the AA587 accident speed. The "ratio changer" system as used on all new-design Boeing transports 
since the 747 classic takes the pilot and unorthodox technique out of the equation. The ratio changer has full pedal 
travel throughout all flight segments, limiting rudder travel at the rudder and allowing full pedal travel to get full 
available deflection.
David Connolly, Brussels, Belgium
 
Human errors
I have followed with great interest the various letters and articles that have appeared in the magazine over the 
years about single-engine flight in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). What I have not seen mentioned 
from either those who promote it or from those who are against, is the human-error risk.
Many readers will no doubt recall the hurried forced landing/ diversion that the crew of one of the UK royal flight 
aircraft had to carry out some years ago because all four engines were leaking oil after a maintenance check.
Maintenance on these aircraft is at least double normal scheduled requirements. Components are changed at half 
life. Only one engine is worked on at a time. Even so, because of the human factor, the near disaster occurred. 
Murphy had struck yet again.
With a multi-engined aircraft, provided maintenance on each engine is staggered, you have the luxury of power 
available on the remaining engine to stay airborne. The remaining engine is then available to provide electrical 
power for flight instruments, navaids, flight management system, autopilot and pressurisation to keep us alive at 
cruise altitude.
I do not totally agree with a past British Airways chairman, who, when questioned why he always crossed the 
Atlantic in four- engined aircraft, replied that there were no five-engined aircraft available. I am happy with three, but 
never one in IMC.
Peter Gray, Redhill, Surrey, UK
 
VTOL snag
Letter
John Hartley's "mad idea" (Flight International, 29 June--5 July) has at least one drawback. Certification ofthe single 
Pegasus-powered Harrier for military very short take-off and landing (VTOL) operations was possible because in 
the event of an engine failure in the hover, the aircraft fell at constant attitude and ejection was likely to be 
successful. To put it mildly, this would not be the case with multiple lift engines spread across the wings of an Avro 
RJ70 -- or any other airframe.

Europe's low-cost airline sector is like First World War trenches before a battle. Only a handful of the 50-plus 
carriers expects eventually to be left standing, but each is desperately working out how to survive.
Air Berlin, a German operator, yesterday announced a deal with Tui's Hapag-Lloyd Flug charter airline to carry 
passengers on each other's services. Meanwhile, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of easyJet, which alongside 
Ireland's Ryanair dominates the European market, said taking his company private was "an option".
Ryanair announced a better-than-expected 24 per cent rise in June passenger traffic, leading some analysts to 
raise earnings forecasts and wonder whether its warnings of a bloodbath this winter have been overdone.
Sooner or later, though, there must be casualties. Germany is an important battleground. Air Berlin, HLX, DBA, 
Germania Express and Germanwings face a challenge from easyJet, adding services at Berlin, Cologne-Bonn and 
Dortmund this year, and Ryanair. The quest for convincing strategies is on.
Mr Haji-Ioannou's family owns 41 per cent of easyJet, the shares of which have traded at less than half this year's 
peak after two profit warnings in a month. Taking it private has attractions: sit out the period of high fuel prices and 
sell later when cut-throat competition has eased.
It would, though, be an about-face for the entrepreneur, who has been reducing his stake to fund other projects 
since stepping down as chairman in 2002.
EasyJet and Ryanair will almost certainly be among the eventual winners, as they are able to cut fares to win 
market share at the expense of short-term profits. Long term, the low-cost market is likely to be as profitable in the 
US. But until the shake-out is past, it will be more comfortable to be a passenger than an investor.

Three leading executives of Aer Lingus have approached the Irish government for permission to prepare a proposal 
for a management buy-out of the state-owned flag carrier.
Willie Walsh, chief executive and leader of the team, said they were "confident that an attractive proposal could be 
developed and financed if the consent is granted".
Approval by the Irish government could trigger competing bids for the airline. It has staged a dramatic financial 
turnround over the past two years and has achieved the second-best operating profit margin in the European airline 
industry after its domestic rival Ryanair.
British Airways, the group's partner in the Oneworld airline alliance, has previously indicated that it could consider 
taking a minority equity stake.
A successful privatisation of Aer Lingus would be a further sign of the diverging fortunes among European carriers, 
with some leading no-frills operators and network carriers in profit, while several smaller flag carriers including 
Alitalia, Swiss International Air Lines and SAS have recently warned that they will suffer further losses this year.
Aer Lingus, which is owned 85.1 per cent by the Irish government and 14.9 per cent by staff, has been a candidate 
for privatisation for several years.
Previous plans had to be abandoned when the airline collapsed into heavy losses in the wake of the September 11. 
attacks The group has since undergone one of the most radical restructuring efforts yet attempted by a European 
flag carrier, successfully cutting costs and lowering fares to compete with the no-frills operators.
Aer Lingus has become the showcase for the European Commission's policy of seeking to block state aid to the 
airline sector and of forcing carriers instead to reorganise and restructure, after having refused an application for aid 
from Dublin in the wake of September 11.
Aer Lingus team proposes buy-out AVIATION:
Aer Lingus has recovered from a Euros 52.1m (Dollars 64.2m) operating loss in 2001 to an operating profit of Euros 
63.8m in 2002 and Euros 83m last year with a 9.3 per cent operating margin.
It has also transformed its network, launching 32 new short-haul routes in Europe since December 2001 and has 
increased the share of online bookings from 8 to 50 per cent in two years.
It is simplifying its fleet and will be an all-Airbus A320 family operator on its short-haul routes by October 2005. It is 
also in negotiations with Airbus and Boeing on a renewal of its long-haul fleet and is a leading potential buyer of the 
US company's new 7E7.

While some of their more illustrious compatriots, including Queen Victoria, were heading for the Riviera, a steady 
stream of 19th century British and Irish travellers forged a path to Pau, in the foothills of the Pyrenees in search of 
healthy air.
The trail was blazed in 1819 by Lord Selkirk, a Scottish nobleman who arrived with his family, servants and a 
doctor. He had intended to continue to Spain for treatment for his advanced tuberculosis. Instead, won over by the 
attractions of Pau, with its medieval chateau and wonderful views of snow-capped peaks, he decided to rent a local 
house and seek a cure on the spot.
In spite of a temporary improvement, Selkirk only survived for seven months. But his doctor, who also suffered from 
the illness, was cured and, on his return to Britain, wrote a book lauding the charms of Pau. Twenty years later, 
another British TB sufferer, a vicar called Ellis, followed in Selkirk's footsteps and, with his writer wife Sarah, 
popularised the area for British visitors with a book entitled Summer and Winter in the Pyrenees.
A stream of visitors headed across the Channel and down into this one- time bastion of Protestantism in the far 
south-west of France. A French-Irish globe-trotting explorer named Henry Russell settled in Pau after expeditions to 
New Zealand and, twice, across the Gobi Desert on foot - his travels were the inspiration for Jules Verne's Round 
the World in 80 Days.
Edward VIII came across from Biarritz. And Napoleon III completed the restoration of the 14th century chateau, 
birthplace of the great local hero, Henri IV, who resolved France's wars of religion by converting to Catholicism and 
whose statue is the town's recurring motif.
Smart new hotels were built on the promenade looking out towards the Pyrenees. The most luxurious, the Gassion, 
was opened in 1872 on the site of the former town prison by an entrepreneur who had made a fortune exporting 
A mountain antidote to modern ills: Jonathan Fenby is revived by Pau, whose Pyrenean charms have provided 
a rest cure to British travellers for 200 years:
French wine to Brazil and importing coffee in return. He had cut his teeth in the hotel business with an 
establishment on the Copacabana. With its lavish salons, multi-lingual staff, hot and cold running water, hydraulic 
lift and Cuban mahogany furniture, the Gassion became one of Europe's smartest holiday destinations.
Pau also boasted a racecourse, a rugby pitch, a cycling stadium and one of the first golf courses on the continent. 
There was salmon fishing and bear hunting in the mountains. In 1887, the New York Herald Tribune declared Pau 
"the hub of the sporting world". A motor race is still run through the town's streets each summer.
After a period of decline in the 20th century, the capital of the Bearn region is enjoying something of a revival, again 
thanks largely to travellers from Britain and Ireland. The opening of a Ryanair route has brought British people who 
have begun to investigate the green and pleasant plain that stretches beneath the Pyrenees in search of a second 
home.
Not far away is the vivid countryside of deepest Gascony. To the south and east, mountain roads run through deep 
valleys to isolated villages, some housing hotels with spectacular views. To the west, it is an easy drive to the 
Basque country, and then on to the Atlantic coastal resorts of Saint Jean de Luz and Biarritz. For the religious, the 
shrine of Lourdes is only 30 miles away.
Just outside Pau, the vineyards of the Jurancon produce excellent wine - Henri IV's grandfather rubbed a few drops 
on the baby's lips along with some garlic to give him a kick-start in life. Chilled, the sweet white is ideal as an 
aperitif.
Local cuisine is hearty rather than refined - thick garbure stew-like soups, tripe andouille sausage and the poule au 
pot (boiled chicken with vegetables) that Henri IV promised to put on each French family's table each Sunday. The 
region also gave its name to one of the best accompaniments to steak or grilled kidneys - sauce bearnaise, mixing 
tarragon, shallots, butter and eggs.
Pau, itself, boasts elegant squares, outdoor restaurants and green parks with huge cedar trees. The spacious Parc 
Beaumont spreads out below the casino. The excellent municipal art gallery has works by El Greco, Degas, Berthe 
Morisot and van Dongen.
Some of the villas built by the foreigners in the town's heyday can be visited, others shelter privately in walled 
gardens. Off the Rue O'Quin, named for a mayor with Irish ancestors, stands an Anglican church, St Andrew's. One 
of the town's most celebrated sons, the Napoleonic marshal, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, who became King of 
Sweden, has his own museum in his birthplace. In quieter mode, there are charming narrow streets in the old town 
beside the castle. The main eyesore is the railway station at the bottom of a funicular running up to the high ridge 
where a local count built the first wooden castle in the 12th century.
The later chateau mixes military architecture, complete with seven-foot thick walls, with some of the Renaissance 
style of the Loire Valley, though much of the interior is the result of 19th century restoration. Gobelins tapestries 
hang on many walls. The table in the huge dining room can seat 100 people.
The tour includes the bedrooms of Napoleon III and his wife, the Empress Eugenie. There is also a collection of 
Ancien Regime chamber pots in elegant porcelain, some designed for ladies to slip under their skirts during long 
church services.
Towards the end of the visit comes a replica of the large sea turtle shell used as a cradle for the infant Henri IV.
Along from the castle, the Boulevard des Pyrenees, with its sweeping, uninterrupted view of the mountains, is a 
high point, as it was when the Victorians came here. There are, inevitably, some unimpressive modern apartment 
blocks taking advantage of the outlook, but you can ignore them as you sit under the palm trees of the esplanade at 
the Best & British cafe - soon to change its name to Royal Saint-Andre in a bid, one of its managers says, to bring 
"the West Coast spirit" to Pau. Further along the boulevard, Pau lays a claim to globalisation with Australian and 
Irish pubs and a Cafe Russe where most of the customers appear to be students from the town's university.
A mountain antidote to modern ills: Jonathan Fenby is revived by Pau, whose Pyrenean charms have provided 
a rest cure to British travellers for 200 years:
As you would expect, there is no shortage of restaurants. Le Dauphin in the Place des Etats has a pleasant terrace, 
and specialises in fish. The Majestic, in the stately Place Royale in the middle of town, offers duck breast with 
spices, grilled Bearn black pudding with apples and sultanas, plus local ham cured for 12 months. A local institution, 
Chez Pierre, boasts mussels with peppers and bacon, skate terrine with herbs, and a cassoulet using thin-skinned 
and richly flavoured beans grown in local maize fields.
Off the Place Clemenceau in the Place Gachet is one of those havens of straightforward quality food at more than 
reasonable prices that you still come across in French provincial towns. Le Berry does not accept reservations, and, 
given the queue outside the entrance, does not need to.
In the bustling main rooms and on the terrace across the pavement, the long menu offers classic, uncomplicated 
dishes, precisely cooked, plus 33 deserts and a good range of regional wines. The food is served in such 
abundance that half portions of some dishes are on offer. A half chateaubriand I ordered for lunch was bigger than 
a full steak you would get in a London restaurant, and cost just Euros 7.50 complete with crisp chips and a bowl of 
superb home-made Bearnaise sauce.
Pau may be quiet compared with more thrusting French towns. But what could be more pleasant than taking an 
aperitif on the Boulevard des Pyrenees, working one's way through the menu at Le Berry, sampling the maize bean 
cassoulet at Chez Pierre - and then heading off for an afternoon on the plain or up in the mountains?

In the five years that I reported on Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, its chief executive, never swore at me. According to 
the Financial Times's Lex column, which recently examined his use of language, Mr O'Leary has sworn at so many 
people that anyone who has escaped must be a nobody.
Among those Mr O'Leary has told to "fuck off" are customers who ask for refunds, staff at Buzz (an airline he 
acquired), and the Belgian authorities who asked him to repay sub-sidies that had been ruled illegal by the 
European Commission.
Some of Europe's politicians are "loonies" and "communists". The Commission is "an evil empire". The people who 
run the Air Transport Users' Council, a UK consumer watchdog, are a "bunch of halfwits".
When Jane O'Keeffe, Ryanair's millionth customer, telephoned to complain that the airline had stopped honouring 
its award to her of free travel for life, Mr O'Leary shouted at her: "Who do you think you are, ringing up demanding 
flights?" David Bonderman, chairman of Ryanair, said of Mr O'Leary: "His strong point is not public relations."
Not in the conventional sense, perhaps. But if you live in Europe, you have almost certainly heard of Ryanair. Want 
to fly from London's Stansted to Frankfurt or Stockholm? Ryanair will take you there for less than it will cost you to 
eat when you arrive (which may be some time later, as the airports Ryanair flies to are often some distance from 
the cities they serve).
Just as Nokia has turned little Finland into a mobile phone success story, so Ryanair has made Ireland the home of 
European aviation innovation - except that Mr O'Leary constantly threatens to move elsewhere in protest at the high 
charges levied by Aer Rianta, the airports authority that Mr O'Leary lovingly calls "a national disgrace".
High pressures of running a low-cost airline: BOOK REVIEW RYANAIR : This incisive work chronicles the 
turbulent history of the carrier and its charismatic head ....
There are about 50 airlines offering cheap flights in Europe, but Ryanair was the first and is still the most 
successful. After the roughest couple of years the airline industry has seen, and after Ryanair's first fall in annual 
profits since 1989, the airline still had net profit margins of 19 per cent in the year to the end of March.
Ryanair did not get where it is because of Mr O'Leary's language, but because of the ruthlessness with costs that 
goes with it. It is by constantly looking for savings that he has been able to offer such low fares. And while he does 
not need to be so rude (good manners, after all, cost nothing), when Mr O'Leary argues that he treats his customers 
well simply by not ripping them off, he has a point.
Siobhan Creaton's account is an unauthorised history of Ryanair. (I would love to be at the meeting at which a 
journalist attempted to persuade Mr O'Leary of the virtues of an authorised history.)
Mr O'Leary does not appear to have co-operated, although it is not easy to tell, because the book, for all its virtues, 
has no footnotes, which means it is difficult to know whether all Mr O'Leary's quotes come from other people's 
published interviews or whether some are from Creaton's own. (Note to the publishers: if you want to provide no-
frills books, you should sell them for 99p, not Pounds 9.99.)
Whatever Mr O'Leary's attitude, Creaton, finance correspondent of The Irish Times, has sensibly not allowed it to 
get in her way.
This savvy, hugely readable book is measured and fair-minded, regaling us with Mr O'Leary's many verbal 
indiscretions without detracting from his achievements - not the least of which is allowing far-flung Irish families to 
get together more often.
One of the episodes in the book provides a particularly sharp insight into the way Ryanair operates. When Go, the 
low-fares airline set up by British Airways and since acquired by EasyJet, decided to fly from Dublin to Edinburgh, 
Mr O'Leary announced that Ryanair would offer flights from Dublin to Edinburgh. Its fares would be lower and its 
flights would be at more convenient times. (Go's flight schedule, he ventured, was "crap".)
Four months later, Go gave up flying from Dublin to Scotland. Barbara Cassani, Go's head, said of this scrap with 
Ryanair: "You can't take on someone with lower costs because they dig deeper than you to lower their prices and 
still make money while you're bleeding."
Ryanair's costs may be low, but has it grown too fast? The original impetus for Europe's low-cost airlines was what 
the travel business calls VFR - visiting friends and relatives. That was why flights between Ireland and England and 
between England and Scotland proved so popular. But are all those other destinations viable?
Creaton notes that by the spring of 2004, Ryanair was offering flights to 125 European airports. Yet flights between 
the UK and Ireland accounted for 44 per cent of revenues in 2002 and 36 per cent in 2003.
However happy families are to see each other, there are only so many flights they can take. Ryanair is now a large 
airline and new opportunities will be harder to find.
Mr O'Leary recently conceded to the FT that Ryanair's "mythical aura of infallibility" had gone. The next chapter will 
be as interesting as the last.

Highlight: They may need cash, but private equity is wary of airlines.
Body
 Private equity companies found a role in the aviation industry during the downturn, investing in the companies that 
the market will not touch. But many airlines remain a little too dangerous. 
 By Jo Murray and Alexander Campbell. 
 GOING PRIVATE 
 At the moment there are thousands of business plans for new start-up carriers circulating the market. Hundreds of 
low-cost airlines are being pitched, with would-be entrepreneurs adapting Southwest's model to different countries 
and markets. There are also others suggesting new freight and regional carriers. Some are from people with no 
experience in the market, others, including Richard Branson's Virgin USA, have already been successful. 
 But there is one thing that all the planned startups have in common: they need cash. This means that they need 
private equity. "The public markets are actually quite difficult to access - you need a track record. If you are 
considered low-risk, you could use them, but very few airlines are low-risk," says Patrick Blaney, CEO of 
Blackstream Aviation in Dublin, which advises Blackstone Group, one of the largest private equity funds, on aviation 
investments. 
 Private equity houses will go for investments that the markets will shun, he says, because they have longer 
planning horizons. "We understand the markets and can take a medium-term view.We're not concerned only about 
the next quarter's results," says Blaney. 
 This is all good news for people planning airlines - but there is a catch. Blaney adds: "However, there is actually 
very little private equity in the airlines at the moment." 
 In good times private equity firms have been moderately active: an investment from Texas Pacific Group helped 
Ryanair through to flotation in the 1990s, and 3i bought out Go from its parent British Airways before selling it on to 
Ryanair in 2002. 
 In the milder downturn of the early 1990s there were a few private equity investments in recovering airlines, but 
there are virtually none now. The most prominent possibility was represented by Texas Pacific Group's interest last 
Going Private
year in US Airways. However, the group did not follow through, and the airline eventually left Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection with the aid of a massive investment from US pensions giant Retirement Systems of Alabama (RSA). 
 Blaney says: "RSA was prepared to do a deal with US Airways on more favourable terms. They may regret it. US 
Airways is still looking uncertain. I can't see that deal as a home run for RSA." 
 In March Oaktree Capital Management invested $125 million in US carrier Spirit Airlines in exchange for a 51% 
stake. 
 Another industry specialist says: "There has been more than you think. In some cases there were efforts, but the 
airline's business plan wasn't viable." He adds that there are exceptions. "Delta Air Lines is on the horizon and may 
need private equity capital soon." 
 There are other reasons why private equity will steer clear of the airline sector: for one thing, overcapacity is still a 
serious problem, not helped by government intervention on both sides of the Atlantic aimed at keeping loss-making 
airlines operating for as long as possible. 
 Blaney explains: "Airline deals are very different, because the business is not only highly cyclical, but brutally 
competitive and going through permanent changes.We are geared up to dealing with difficult areas, but it is very 
difficult to get acceptable levels ofreturn in the airline business. It's difficult to justify any investment in the sector. 
Putting in our money to maintain an artificially high level of airline activity is a bad idea, and there are not the returns 
to justify the levels of investment they need." 
 Not all agree.Neil MacFadyean of Aberdeen Murray is more optimistic. "We took the view two years ago that there 
were attractive opportunities, if we had the right team, and we haven't changed our view," he says. 
 He adds: "Clearly there are uncertainties - there are geopolitical issues, the tourist industry hasn't really recovered 
since 2001 and 2002, the price of fuel, the instability of the dollar - but there is a return to be made." 
 The latest downturn has also seen the US introduce state support in the form of Air Transportation Stabilization 
Board loans and grants to carriers, supposedly to redress the damage done by the September 11, 2001 terrorist 
attacks on the US. This may have reduced the need for private equity cash, by presenting the airlines with a more 
accessible source of funding. 
 Private equity investment comes at a price, and one industry specialist says: "Private equity is typically more 
expensive and has more strings attached.When the industry recovers, there will be less demand for private equity: 
in healthier times they can raise cheaper capital." 
 The sheer size of some of the troubled airlines also makes private equity investment difficult: even Carlyle, with 
billions under management, has limits. In the generally promising aerospace sector, Peter Clare, managing director 
of Carlyle's aerospace and defence practice says that the company will steer clear of very large investments. 
"There are two things that I would point to: being a prime or original equipment manufacturer [OEM] for aircraft 
engines or airframes," says Clare. He adds: "These require such a high level of capital and investment which goes 
beyond our capability to supply the financial backing that is necessary to be successful.We are focusing on tierone 
and tier-two suppliers to both the engine and the airframe primes or OEMs." 
 The size of the investment required would make private equity companies wary of the major airlines even during a 
normal downturn. But this has been far from normal - closer to a revolution, says one industry insider - and for all 
their size and power player status, even private equity investors are staying well clear of the turmoil. 
 Nor are they likely to re-enter soon; even with traffic beginning to pick up, the future of several of the major carriers 
is still uncertain, and when the airlines return to profitability, there will be other, easier sources of cash than the 
private equity houses. 
 FORGET AIRLINES - THINK AEROSPACE 
Going Private
 The airline industry crisis has hit the aerospace manufacturing sector hard, with deliveries of airliners falling by half 
from the more prosperous late 1990s. As the aerospace industry pulls back up from the bottom of the cycle, private 
equity companies are interested, with KKR buying German engine manufacturer MTU and Carlyle Group buying 
Fiat's aero engine subsidiary Fiat Avio (now Avio). Carlyle, in particular, has long been a defence and aerospace 
specialist, using its enviable contacts list - former US defence secretary Frank Carlucci was previously the group's 
chairman, and its payroll has included former US president, George Bush, Northrop Grumman's ex-chairman Kent 
Kresa and former UK prime minister John Major - to turn round the companies it buys, often producing impressive 
profits. 
 Since 1987, Carlyle has invested about $2 billion in 29 aerospace and defence companies, focusing on defence 
electronics, commercial aerospace manufacturing and services, government contracting and services, and 
information technology. Its latest takeover, early in July, of engine overhaul specialist Standard Aero, part of Dunlop 
Standard Aerospace, cost $670 million. 
 An investment made by Carlyle would typically be held for a period of four to six years before that investment is 
realized and investors receive their share of the gains. However, the aerospace and defence sector is a special 
case. "Within aerospace, the holding period would tend to be longer. Aerospace cycles are long - six to 12 years - 
and the period it takes to invest in new aircraft or engine programmes and the payback on those programmes is 
very long, 15 or more years," says Peter Clare, managing director of Carlyle's aerospace and defence practice. 
"You just can't be an investor in the aerospace industry and expect to be flipping companies in just two to three 
years. You have to have a much longer-term perspective." 
 Despite enduring two serious aerospace downturns, in the early 1990s and after the September 11, 2001 terrorist 
attacks on the US, Carlyle has managed impressive returns. In the commercial aerospace arena, for example, 
realized investments include casting specialist Howmet, in which Carlyle invested $104 million in private equity in 
1995 and achieved 7.6 times that sum when it sold out in 1999. Similarly, the first Vought Aircraft private equity 
investment took place in 1992, eventually yielding 3.6 times the original $38 million outlay. 
 The aerospace sector suffers from its own industry cycles, as well as wider economic downturns and the dips 
caused by terrorism, war and the Sars virus. Why is it that Carlyle has not stayed clear of this industry and the 
baggage that comes with it? Clare cites two reasons. "It is fundamental to Carlyle's whole investment strategy that 
by having deep industry expertise we are able to make better investment decisions for our customers - the 
investors," he says. "In many ways, the more complex an industry is, the greater advantage we have by having 
industry expertise." 
 Patrick Blaney, CEO of Blackstream Aviation in Dublin, agrees. "Our skill set enables private equity to operate 
where other sources won't. We have very bright, perceptive people, can operate quickly and have substantial 
amounts of cash," he says. 
 The other key to success is timing. Clare says: "You really have to understand where the bottom of the cycle will 
be, given the age and size of the existing fleet, the expected growth in available seat-miles and the macroeconomic 
view. You put those three things together and you have to make a decision as to where you think the bottom of the 
cycle will be." He adds that, finally, the industry has passed this point - for manufacturers and suppliers around the 
world, the recovery is under way. 
 Another industry specialist agrees. "It's all about where we are in the cycle. We have had a downturn over the past 
two years with now an expectation of growth: private equity loves that profile. The best time for private equity is 
early in the upturn." 
 Because their investments are long-term and risky, private equity houses place great stress on a good 
management team. "We look for a combination of three factors," says Clare. "First and foremost we are looking for 
companies that are technology leaders. These are companies that are the best at what they do. The second 
criterion is a strong management team, which has proved its ability both to develop and execute a business plan. 
Going Private
The third, and equally important, factor is that we get to buy the company at a fair and reasonable price. If we can 
get the three criteria together, we often find we have a good deal of success." 
 He adds: "We are not managers of businesses. We take a proactive role at the board of directors' level and we will

Irish no-frills carrier Ryanair today celebrated 15 years on the Dublin to Stansted route after carrying 10m 
passengers.
Ryanair today said it hopes to carry 1.3 million passengers on the route this year alone. The route began in 1989 
with two daily flights and recorded 15,000 passengers.
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said the growth of the route has been phenomenal. "Over 
the last 15 years, Ryanair's passengers on the London Stansted to Dublin route have saved over a billion euro on 
high fares, and Ryanair will continue to offer Irish and British consumers Europe's lowest air fares between the two

Price war and fuel costs to drive SAS to a loss

SAS, the Nordic region's largest airline, yesterday warned that it would suffer a full-year loss in 2004, the latest 
victim of savage price competition and high fuel prices.
The carrier said passenger yields slid 22.5 per cent year-on-year in May at its main Scandinavian Airlines unit. SAS 
cited the competitive pressures on domestic routes in Sweden and on its international network out of Copenhagen, 
though intra-Nordic routes are also suffering.
"Many of the competitors we have are loss-making and heavily loss-making. It is an unsustainable situation," said a 
company executive.
The SAS warning underlines the continuing serious problems facing the airline industry both in Europe and in the 
US, despite the recovery in traffic volumes so far this year.
Alitalia, the majority state-owned Italian flag carrier, is still teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. The Italian 
government was forced this week to agree an emergency Euros 400m (Dollars 484m) bridging loan to keep it 
afloat, as management works on another restructuring package.
Swiss International Air Lines warned earlier this week that it would fail to meet its financial targets and would suffer 
another operating loss this year because of rising fuel costs and unsuccessful attempts to reduce maintenance 
costs.
The low-cost airlines led by Ryanair and EasyJet are adding many new aircraft and both are active in Scandinavia. 
On top of this, several small new entrants have entered the Nordic market attacking SAS's most profitable routes.
Similar issues are confronting the network airlines in the US, which are expected to run up further heavy losses in 
2004 for the fourth year in succession. Although passenger numbers have increased, reductions in business class 
prices and more economy class travel has meant SAS has not been able to profit by the upturn.
Price war and fuel costs to drive SAS to a loss
SAS has launched a wide-ranging savings programme aimed at cutting unit costs by 30 per cent. So far 4,000 jobs 
have been lost with another 2,000 to go - in total about 17 per cent of the workforce.
The full effects of the savings package will not be felt until next year.
* Lufthansa is seeking a new labour agreement which would cut its call centre costs by 40 per cent, writes Jenny 
Genger in Hamburg. Employee representatives fear the move could undermine the German airline's current single 
pay tariff deal across all of its 90,000 employees.

Irish no-frills carrier Ryanair today said it had flown 85 million passengers since the firm's launch in 1985.
The carrier said that, this year alone, it will carry 28 million passengers on its 149 routes in 16 countries.
Paul Fitzsimmons, Ryanair's head of communications, said the firm had hit a significant milestone in passenger 
numbers.
 "Ryanair is achieving record-breaking figures again and again with our winning formula of low-fares, unbeatable 
punctuality and great choice of destinations such as Barcelona, Sardinia, Rome and Stockholm. Europeans may 
not speak the same language but when it comes to air-travel we are all singing from the same hymn sheet - 
consumers want low-fares and on-time flights and Ryanair delivers both consistently," he said. Ryanair said that its 
customers have saved around E8.5bn since the firm started trading. More than 45 million Irish passengers have 
saved more than E4bn by flying Ryanair, the airline said.

Tony Fernandes appears to be taking his biggest gamble since he launchedAirAsia, south-east Asia's leading low-
cost airline, in late 2001.
Plans by the Malaysia-based carrier to increase its jet fleet four-fold and talks with the Malaysian government to 
take over some domestic routes from state-owned Malaysian Airline System (MAS) threaten to stretch the 
resources of the start-up carrier.
The purchase of 80 aircraft, with an estimated list price of USDollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn, from either Boeing or Airbus 
would burden debt-free AirAsia with new financial obligations. Taking over part of the MAS domestic network might 
seem risky, since the national carrier has lost an estimated USDollars 350m annually on local routes.
But Mr Fernandes rejects suggestions that AirAsia could be repeating the mistake of European budget carriers, 
such as RyanAir, by over-expanding.
"We don't want to do anything that would jeopardise our business model. We're a very conservative company, with 
a focus on positive cashflow," said the AirAsia chief executive.
Instead, analysts believe that AirAsia is making a shrewd move to secure its dominant position in south-east Asia 
before new rivals are able to gain a significant foothold.
"AirAsia has first-mover advantage. It's the only game in town," said Timothy Ross, an aviation analyst with UBS in 
Hong Kong.
AirAsia's success in tapping demand among the region's 500m population has spawned several competitors that 
have recently launched services or plan to do so by the end of the year. They include Valuair and Tiger Airways in 
Singapore, One-Two-Go and Nok Air in Thailand and Lion Air in Indonesia.
Start-up carrier with big ambitions: First-mover advantage could be enough to see airline through risky 
expansion strategy that will stretch resources, writes J....
The purchase of new aircraft would make AirAsia far larger than any of its potential low-cost rivals. With more than 
100 aircraft, AirAsia's fleet size would numerically be close to that of Singapore Airlines, although its seating 
capacity would only be about a third since AirAsia's fleet would consist of smaller Boeing 737s or Airbus 320s or 
A319s.
Mr Ross believes that AirAsia will have the financial resources to bear the cost of new aircraft purchases since it is 
likely to get a steep discount of at least 30-40 per cent by placing a bulk order when demand is still weak. Moreover, 
an aircraft delivery schedule of four or five years would stretch out the payment burden.
AirAsia is expected to raise about USDollars 200m through an initial public offering in the fourth quarter this year to 
help pay for the aircraft expansion.
"Given AirAsia's potential, I don't expect they will have any difficulties raising additional funding from the banks," 
said Mr Ross.
AirAsia's original intent was to use the new aircraft to increase flight frequency along existing routes and fill in gaps 
in its network, which includes Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia.
But AirAsia was also recently approached by the Malaysian government to take over part of the MAS domestic 
network, according to industry officials.
AirAsia's involvement is part of a wider government plan to revive the struggling national carrier by forcing it to 
focus on more profitable international routes.
MAS has lost money on its domestic operations because it "has the wrong structure for domestic service, with the 
wrong aircraft and an overstaffed organisation", said Mr Ross.
In contrast, AirAsia has been able to achieve profits on domestic routes in spite of charging prices that are lower 
than the state regulated fares that MAS partly blames for its losses.
Industry officials believe that AirAsia will agree to take over more flights from MAS on its existing routes, while MAS 
will continue to operate feeder routes that require smaller aircraft than AirAsia possesses. AirAsia now flies 2.7m 
passengers annually in Malaysia against 10m for MAS.
"Based on their past record, I don't think (AirAsia) would do anything rash," said Richard Stirland, director-general 
of the Kuala Lumpur-based Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, which represents the region's full-service carriers, 
including MAS.
"AirAsia is not biting off too much since it just expands some of their existing domestic operations, which could 
prove to be more profitable than some of their international routes."

Low-cost carrier Ryanair today said it would increase its cabin baggage allowance but would increase its excess 
baggage charges.
The airline said it would increase its maximum allowance for cabin baggage from seven to ten kilos from the end of

The current hold-baggage maximum allowance of 15 kilos per passenger will remain unchanged.
However, Ryanair said it was increasing its excess baggage charges from E6 per kilo to E7 a kilo.
 Ryanair's head of customer services, Caroline Green said the changes are part of the carrier's efforts to encourage 
hand baggage only. "These positive changes to our baggage allowances will benefit Ryanair's 28 million 
passengers this year, and at the same time encourage passengers not to exceed baggage limits," she said.

The matter was raised by the Labour leader, Pat Rabbitte, who said that Senator O'Rourke told the Seanad

 The Senator accepted that a donation of E63,000 from Michael O'Leary to the Progressive Democrats three years

STOVL F-35 hit by propulsion hitch
 
Staff
Pratt & Whitney has halted tests on the Lockheed Martin F-35B short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) engine 
variant for at least one month after detecting an erosion problem. Unexpected wear and tear appeared on a second 
stage low-pressure turbine vane in the F135 STOVL powerplant after less than two months of performance checks 
on a test stand in West Palm Beach, Florida, P&W says. The Joint Strike Fighter engine entered testing in mid-
April, and the anomaly was detected in early June. Testing may resume in July, but engineers are still searching for 
potential causes of the erosion in the low-pressure turbine section, which drives the STOVL variant's unique lift fan. 
P&W says the engine tests were running ahead of the original schedule, so a possible four-week delay now should 
not affect the overall development schedule. First flight for the F-35B is scheduled for mid-2007 under a revised 
schedule presented to the Defense Acquisition Board on 17 June (Flight International, 8-15 June).
Regions demonstrate airline boost

A lobbying group for poorer European areas is attempting to block expected curbs on state aid to regional airports, 
arguing that the growth of no-frills carriers at Europe's secondary airports is vital to regions' economies. The

low-fares airlines as a "catalyst for economic development and job creation" in drafting new guidelines on state aid. 
The commission has been revising existing rules on state aid, after Charleroi Brussels South airport was judged to 
have breached anti-subsidy rules in its deals with Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair in February.

Ryanair today welcomed the publication of the Airports Bill, which will lead to the break up of the Aer Rianta into 
three separate bodies.
Ireland and Europe's largest low-cost carrier said the break-up of the, "airport monopoly" would allow some limited 
competition between Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said the current Aer Rianta board had proved to be, "an abject failure".
 "No one in Irish tourism should feel any regret at getting rid of the Aer Rianta monopoly or the Board that has run it 
so badly for the last 10 years. Despite their doubling of airport charges, profits have collapsed from almost E40m in 
1994 to just E20m in 2003. They have missed out on the tourism explosion delivered by low fares airlines in 
Europe," he said. With his customary straight-talking, O'Leary said Aer Rianta was, "responsible for third rate, third 
world airport facilities, ridiculous queues and car parks that are miles away from the terminal building". "They have 
delivered a regime at Dublin Airport, which the Aviation Regulator previously confirmed was, '50pc more inefficient

CAE is to provide Airbus A319 training for European low-fare carrier EasyJet under a seven-year agreement 
expected to be worth around C$40-60 million ($29-44 million). The deal includes the establishment of CAE's first 
commercial aviation training centre in the UK.
The Canadian company will produce two A320-family full-flight simulators and two maintenance/ flight training 
devices for installation in its Burgess Hill plant in the UK. Mainly working on marine and military training 
programmes, the existing facility has room for four simulator bays, says CAE.
The first simulator will be ready for training in October, with the second to be in service by the end of the year. 
Airbus and CAE will deliver the training under their existing co-operation agreement. EasyJet will take delivery of 
three-to-four A319s a month over the next three years, and has to train 200 crews a year from 2005 to 2007, says 
Airbus.
CAE has previously supplied a Boeing 737-800 simulator to rival European low-cost carrier Ryanair. The simulator, 
installed in Ryanair's own training centre at the UK's Nottingham East Midlands airport, received Level D approval 
in March.

Since September last year when fuselage fatigue cracks caused by an incorrect maintenance procedure came to 
light on some Ryanair Boeing 737-200s and Qantas 747-400s, Boeing has found the same type of damage in 53 
aircraft, the US Federal Aviation Administration reveals. The Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has 
warned that the FAA, which has already added its advice to Boeing bulletins on the subject, may produce an 
airworthiness directive making aircraft inspections and repairs mandatory.
Two Qantas 747-400s were grounded temporarily in September after serious cracks, originating from damage 
caused by workers using metal instead of wood implements to scrape old sealant and paint out of lap joints during 
repainting, were found in the fuselages during D checks. The aircraft were acquired from Malaysia Airlines in 1998. 
At about the same time Ryanair claimed that it had to retire its six 737-200s early because of "scribing" damage, 
which is the term given to the marks made in the metal by scraping (Flight International, 10-16 February). Boeing 
has revealed that scribing can lead to cracks 130-250mm (5-10in) long, 22,000 cycles after the damage was 
caused.
Boeing says that now 32 737s, four 747s and and seven 757s have been found with scribing-related cracking, and 
it is working with the FAA to determine whether more inspection and repair solutions are required, according to 
CASA.

European pilots demonstrated outside a European Union transport ministers' meeting to approve controversial new 
flightcrew duty time (FCDT) limitations last week, as on the other side of the Atlantic a report blamed a freighter 
crash on fatigue-related pilot misjudgement.
The EU meeting, held in Luxembourg on 10-11 June, was expected to approve a new pan-EU FCDT limitation law 
that, according to the demonstrating pilots -- led by the European Cockpit Association (ECA) -- will have the overall 
effect of increasing maximum allowable duty hours, reducing rest time between sectors, and removing limits on 
consecutive night duties.
The British Air Line Pilots Association (BALPA) says the UK is one of a small number of few European countries to 
have comprehensive FCDT regulations, and the ECA wanted the new rules to be based on them. However, the EU 
law will extend the maximum permissible long-haul crew duty from 12h to 14h without the need to augment the 
crew, says BALPA. It will also reduce the break time between sectors from 45min to one period of 45min between 
every three sectors, and remove the limits on the number of consecutive night duties, says the pilot union.
The UK's two main long-haul airlines, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, both say the new rules will make no 
difference to their practices because they are bound by industrial agreements as well as safety considerations. Both 
say they will continue to augment crews on long-haul flights to enable the crew to take in-flight rest. Michael 
O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, says if the new rules affect pilot rostering at all it will be to limit flexibility further 
"for the most cossetted group of employees in the world".
BALPA says a study of more than 50 serious crew-error related accidents shows that the risk of pilot- misjudgement 
crashes increases sixfold when crew duty time is more than 13h, compared with 10h or less on duty.
EU pilots protest at duty hike; US crash probe cites fatigue; Crews demonstrate over move to cut rest time as 
report blames accident on tiredness
In its report on the July 2002 FedEx Express Boeing 727-200 crash, the US National Transportation Safety Board 
(NTSB) says the captain had insufficient sleep before duty, the co-pilot had suffered frequently changing sleep 
cycles due to his roster, and "it is possible" that the flight engineer was also fatigued.
The misjudgements that led the aircraft to crash on a night approach by flying too low were probably fatigue-related, 
says NTSB member Carol Carmody who says: "The cockpit was inattentive, sloppy, no-one noticed the red 
[precision approach path indicator] lights...it is not a good thing when accidents involve inattention to duty."
 
Equipment not to blame, NTSB report says
 
David Learmount
The FedEx Express Boeing 727-200F went well below the proper glideslope path during a night visual approach 
flown by the first officer, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) says in its report on the 26 July 2002 
accident.
The aircraft was approaching runway 09 at Tallahassee regional airport when it hit trees on short final approach and 
crashed. Both pilots and the flight engineer were seriously injured and the aircraft was destroyed. The summary 
rules out weather, aircraft or load problems and airport lighting as factors, giving the probable cause as "the 
captain's and first officer's failure to establish and maintain a proper glidepath during the night visual approach to 
landing".
Contributing to the crash, says the summary, "was a combination of the captain's and the first officer's 
fatigue...[their] failure to adhere to company flight procedures, the captain's and the flight engineer's failure to 
monitor the approach, and the first officer's colour vision deficiency". The first officer had a licence waiver for colour 
vision deficiency, and the report argues that this affected his ability to react to the runway precision approach path 
indicator lights (white and red) which would have clearly shown that the approach was too low.

CAE is to provide Airbus A319 training for European low-fare carrier EasyJet under a seven-year agreement 
expected to be worth around C$40-60 million ($29-44 million). The deal includes the establishment of CAE's first 
commercial aviation training centre in the UK.
The Canadian company will produce two A320-family full-flight simulators and two maintenance/ flight training 
devices for installation in its Burgess Hill plant in the UK. Mainly working on marine and military training 
programmes, the existing facility has room for four simulator bays, says CAE.
The first simulator will be ready for training in October, with the second to be in service by the end of the year. 
Airbus and CAE will deliver the training under their existing co-operation agreement. EasyJet will take delivery of 
three-to-four A319s a month over the next three years, and has to train 200 crews a year from 2005 to 2007, says 
Airbus.
CAE has previously supplied a Boeing 737-800 simulator to rival European low-cost carrier Ryanair. The simulator, 
installed in Ryanair's own training centre at the UK's Nottingham East Midlands airport, received Level D approval 
in March.
In response to CAE's partnership with Airbus, Boeing subsidiary Alteon Training has teamed with United Airlines to 
offer Airbus training for third-party customers at the US carrier's Denver, Colorado simulator centre.Copyright 2004

Tom Dalrymple is a fairly slight man, so he admits his youthful passion for rugby taught him the virtues of ducking 
and diving. It is a skill the chairman of Flyglobespan, the Scottish low-cost airline, still finds handy when battling 
sector heavyweights such as Ryanair, for instance.
Last year, Mr Dalrymple shifted his fledgling airline's west coast operations from Prestwick, Ryanair's Scottish hub 
in Ayrshire, to Glasgow airport. There was no point, he says, in trying to wrestle with the industry's Jonah Lomu on 
its home patch. "Ryanair are Prestwick airport. There's no room for anyone else flying from Prestwick to 
destinations that they fly to - none," he says.
Flyglobespan is, instead, carving out its own patch. And despite recent growls from Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's 
punchy chief executive, of an impending "bloodbath" in the low-cost sector - one he suggested would also engulf 
Flyglobespan - Mr Dalrymple insists the three-year-old airline will be both alive, this time next year, and growing.
One reason is that Flyglobespan has hedged against the currently punitive rise in oil prices. "We're hedged for the 
summer and halfway into next winter," he says.
Another is that Flyglobespan has deeper pockets than some of its ill-fated peers, such as Duo, the Birmingham-
based operator which went bust in April. Flyglobespan was hatched two years ago from Globespan, a successful 
Edinburgh-based charter and tours business that the 59-year-old Mr Dalrymple bought in the 1970s, and which has 
been in "unbroken" profit since. "Even if I don't sell another ticket all summer, there'll still be change in the bank next 
year," he says.
But it is just this travel business ancestry that Mr Dalrymple believes will ultimately underpin Flyglobespan's 
survival. By selling ticket-less, low-cost holidays and flights on the same website, Mr Dalrymple is attempting a 
Flyweight airline competes with big hitters: Despite talk of an impending bloodbath, Flyglobespan's chairman 
says his group will still be here next year, wr
distinct and, he argues, more durable, business model than Ryanair, EasyJet or other low-cost carriers. "In ten 
years' time, no-one will be doing it any other way," he says.
After dipping a toe in the airline business with a limited service from Edinburgh to Nice two years ago, Mr Dalrymple 
leased two more aircraft, last year, and launched routes to Spain, carrying about 170,000 customers. This summer - 
having, in the meantime, bought Cougar Airlines from the administrators, complete with two more leased aircraft 
and a CAA licence - the airline will fly from Glasgow and Edinburgh to nine destinations in Italy, France and Spain. 
Mr Dalrymple expects to fly 500,000 passengers this year.
Flyglobespan, which now runs a fleet of five Boeing 737-300s, sells 80 per cent of its tickets online, from a website 
listing flights and holiday packages that is updated for offers and availability every three hours. It specialises in 
offering short- notice, short-stay breaks to cities and sunspots.
Most of the accommodation is backed by arrangements with local hotel chains in Spain, France and Italy, though 
Globespan also owns and runs its own apartments and hotels in Nice and Majorca. It is this part of the business Mr 
Dalrymple is keen gradually to expand. Altogether, a third of Flyglobespan passengers buy accommodation along 
with a flight - transactions, which, like the flights alone, are paperless and electronic.
The cost savings of "breaking the cycle of paper" in traditional package tour transactions was immense, he says. 
But selling paperless holidays required winning customer faith. "The test was whether you could take package 
holiday customers and give them nothing but an e-mail confirmation - no other paper, nothing when they land or 
when they take the bus to the airport. Just what they printed before they left."
The answer, so far, appears that the model works. Globespan's overall profits, last year, dipped slightly from 
Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 2m on turnover of Pounds 70m, but that was chiefly attributable to the depressing effect of 
severe acute respiratory syndrome on Flyglobespan's parent company's charter business to Canada.
The airline, meanwhile, was profitable in only its second year of operation. Mr Dalrymple expects the airline this 
year to contribute Pounds 40m to a total Globespan turnover of Pounds 100m.
Analysts suggest Mr Dalrymple has been acute in seeking to distinguish Flyglobespan's offering. "He's right 
absolutely that you have to differentiate," says Chris Avery of JP Morgan. "You have to do something different, 
because otherwise, if you're not in the top three of Ryanair, EasyJet or BA, people are just not going to hit your 
site."
But so far this year, Flyglobespan is enjoying a decent hit-rate. Mr Dalrymple says the airline's five 148-seater 
aircraft are flying 90 per cent full and he has ordered two bigger 189-seater 737-800s to boost capacity further next 
summer.

The FTSE 100 gained 0.8 per cent on the week at 4,484, taking in its stride the decision on Thursday to raise 
interest rates and focusing more on weaker oil prices.
BP and Shell weathered the decline, with the former holding steady at 484 1/2p and Shell rising 1.3 per cent to 
400p.
The mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 1.1 per cent on the week to 6,159.1. Trading volume yesterday was a subdued 1.6bn, 
with US markets closed for the national day of mourning for former president Ronald Reagan.
The biggest surprise of the week came from EasyJet, which on Monday issued its second profit-warning in just over 
a month.
The shares fell 19.4 per cent to finish the week at 161 3/4p after the low-cost airline warned that fuel prices and 
aggressive competition would hurt profits this year.
The airline's latest woes came a month after it warned of a price war, with rival Ryanair also warning of an industry 
"bloodbath" if price cutting continued in the industry.
Brokers rushed to downgrade EasyJet. UBS lowered its price target to 165p from 350p. Goldman Sachs reduced its 
pretax profit estimate for the year by 27 per cent to Pounds 60.5m and JP Morgan cut its operating profit forecast by 
51.2 per cent.
Bid speculation in the banking sector sent shares in Abbey National 4.2 per cent higher on the week to 483p.
Maarten van den Bergh, chairman of Lloyds TSB, set the ball rolling when he called on the government to relax the 
rules on mergers between UK banks.
The Competition Commission in effect ruled out mergers among the top six banks in 2001 when it rejected Lloyds 
TSB's hostile bid for Abbey National.
Higher rates taken in stride as oil declines LONDON:
Shares in Lloyds TSB initially fell on suggestions that it may want to bid again for Abbey National. But they finished 
the week up 2.2 per cent at 440 1/4p after Lloyds reiterated that its primary focus was on organic growth rather than 
big acquisitions.
Barclays, 1.3 per cent ahead on the week at 489p, took up the bid baton, with strong support within the UK's third-
biggest high street bank for a bid for Cazenove, the 181-year-old City stockbroker. The investment bank Barclays 
Capital is especially keen.
Marks and Spencer was 2.4 per cent better at 366p, but dealers sense it is becoming increasingly difficult for Philip 
Green to make an improved bid for the retailer.
GUS continued to be one of the stars of the retail sector, rising 0.8 per cent on the week to 844p. With few obvious 
synergies between its three core businesses - Argos, Burberry and Experian - investors are calling for a break up of 
the company.
In anticipation Deutsche Bank raised its recommendation on the stock to "buy" and increased its price target to 
Pounds 10. Deutsche also expects the buyback programme to grow as the company's strategic review progresses. 
The bank estimates about Pounds 900m will eventually be returned to shareholders.
In the latest FTSE quarterly reshuffle, Capita returned to the benchmark index of 100 blue-chip stocks. The support 
services group is replacing GKN, the engineer that last month sold its stake in the AgustaWestland helicopter 
venture to Italy's Finmeccanica for Pounds 1bn. Shares in Capita rose 0.3 per cent through the week to 313 1/2p 
and GKN was up 3.8 per cent at 241p.
Entering the mid-cap FTSE 250 were Catlin, the insurer, Cambridge Silicon Resources, the chip manufacturer, 
Burren Energy, the oil and gas explorer, and Alvis, the tank maker that is set to be taken over by BAE Systems. 
Shares in Catlin fell 0.1 per cent to 363p during the week, CSR rose 10 per cent to 374p, Burren added 6.1 per cent 
at 286 1/2p and Alvis was up 0.2 per cent at 316 1/2p.
The quartet will replace RPS, the environmental consultancy, up 3.1 per cent at 123 3/4p; Autonomy, the software 
company, 0.7 per cent ahead at 222p; Filtronic, the hardware technology company, which fell 4.8 per cent to 304 
1/2p; and peer Wolfson Microelectronics, which rose 12.2 per cent to 266 3/4p. All the changes will be implemented 
after the close of trade on Friday.
BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, added 4.7 per cent to 625 1/2p through the week after James Murdoch, chief 
executive, announced a drive to increase subscriber numbers and revenue.
Morgan Stanley was impressed and repeated its "overweight" rating, saying that the prospects for higher revenues 
outweighed concerns that margins would decline.
Imperial Tobacco, the world's fourth-biggest cigarette maker, dropped 2.3 per cent on the week to Pounds 11.95 
because of a slowdown in Germany, which accounts for about 20 per cent of the company's profits. German 
smokers are reportedly cutting back following a tax rise in March.
And William Hill lost 1.8 per cent to 537p after David Harding, chief executive, sold almost all his 1m shares in the 
UK's second-biggest betting chain. The company stressed that Mr Harding had sold for personal reasons. But 
broker Seymour Pierce advised investors to sell because of stiff competition in the gaming sector.
* The FTSE 100 fell less than 1 per cent yesterday, as did the FTSE 250. The day's action centred on Geest, the 
fresh food group, which added 2 per cent to 575p, on bid speculation after Iceland's Bakkovor increased its stake to 
16.5 per cent.
Royal & Sun Alliance, the insurer, rose 1.6 per cent to 80 1/4p after Sweden's Folksam, the mutual insurer, said it 
had joined the bidding for Trygg Hansa, the Swedish business that Codan, the Danish financial services firm that 
RSA controls, has put up for sale.
Higher rates taken in stride as oil declines LONDON:
Shares in Close Brothers, the independent City bank, fell 3.3 per cent to 775p after Caledonia Investments sold 
7.4m shares, or a 5.1 per cent stake, at 775p each. However Caledonia, up 0.4 per cent at Pounds 10.91, retains a 
12.5 per cent stake and said it was "a long-term core investment".
Cable and Wireless lost 1.2 per cent to 128 1/2p after Morgan Stanley cut its price target on the telecoms company 
by 5p per share and repeated its "underweight" stance, saying improvements in the UK business were offset by 
costs elsewhere.
Next dropped 1 per cent to Pounds 14.15 after Merrill Lynch downgraded the clothing retailer to "neutral" from "buy" 
and cut its price target by 5 per cent. The bank argued it would be difficult for Next to sustain recent rates of growth.
FirstGroup, the UK's second-biggest bus and rail company, gained 1.8 per cent to 279 1/2p after it was named as 
the preferred bidder for the seven-year Scottish Passenger Rail franchise. National Express which currently holds 
the franchise, slipped 0.3 per cent to 714 1/2p.

TBI, the regional airport operator, was cautious yesterday about how the price war in the low-cost airline sector is 
likely to affect its business.
Caroline Price, finance director, said the aviation sector over the past few years had faced "challenge after 
challenge - and this is another of them, which obviously causes us to be cautious".
TBI's low-cost traffic grew 31 per cent in the year to March 31, of which 82 per cent was generated by three airlines: 
Ryanair out of Stockholm Skavsta and London Luton airports; EasyJet out of Luton and Belfast; and BMIbaby out of 
Cardiff and Belfast.
Ms Price said TBI was sensitive to the number of passengers carried by the low-cost airlines - which now 
accounted for 62 per cent of the group's traffic - rather than their profitability or their rate of capacity growth.
But she acknowledged: "There is a supply chain here. We are not in the front line but we are in the back room."
She said the "gorillas" of Ryanair and EasyJet should be able to withstand the price war while BMIbaby was 
somewhat protected by its parent.
Smaller operators were more vulnerable but these accounted for a smaller proportion of TBI's business.
The comments came as TBI reported a 45 per cent fall in pre-tax profit in the year to March 31, from Pounds 11.2m 
to Pounds 6.2m, after a Pounds 5.9m goodwill write-down in relation to its US-based airport services business. It is 
now selling this operation. Before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, profit slipped from Pounds 23.6m to 
Pounds 23m.
Passenger numbers at TBI's UK airports rose 15 per cent. However, it had experienced some cost increases as 
well as pressure on earnings per passenger from a decline in full-service customers and early discounts to low-cost 
carriers. Turnover rose from Pounds 177.6m to Pounds 186.2m.
TBI cautions on 'challenge' of fare war in low-cost airline sector TRANSPORT:
Ms Price said TBI had not had any further contact with Hochtief since January when the German group decided to 
abandon a possible takeover. There were no plans to take the group private, she said.
A maintained final dividend of 1.6p gives an unchanged total of 2.3p.
Losses per share were 0.17p against earnings per share of 0.94p last time.
FT Comment
* Just as some stabilityis emerging in the global aviation sector, a new cloud has appeared: the fare war.TBI 
reckons it is sensitive to its low-cost customers' volumes, not profitability. But pressure on fares could prompt low-
cost carriers to drive harder bargains while some might not be around at all. Oriel Securities, joint broker to the 
company, forecasts 2005 profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items but including the FRS 17 
pension charge, of Pounds 27m. On yesterday's fall of 1p to 63p, the shares trade on a demanding forward p/e of

Low-cost airlines gang up on Alitalia

Body
Alitalia yesterday came under attack from low-cost airlines urging the European Commission to stand firm against a 
government bail-out of the troubled state-owned group.
Virgin Express, the Brussels-based no-frills carrier, accused Alitalia of using predatory pricing tactics on routes 
between Italy and Brussels. It argued that Alitalia "will never be able to make any money if it uses such tactics" and 
that the Commission should therefore ensure that it receives no further state aid.
Allegations of predatory prices are often hard for Brussels to pursue, since it needs to establish that a dominant 
company is pricing below cost with the intention of chasing its rivals out of the market.
However, the letter, and a separate complaint spearheaded by Ireland's Ryanair, add to the pressure on the 
Commission to crack down on Alitalia, which has already received billions of euros of state money over the past 
decade.
The company is hoping to secure a bridging loan to shore up its position, although the Italian government has 
sought to postpone any decision on its involvement until after the European and local elections this weekend. Some 
Italian ministers resolutely oppose a state bail-out.
Compounding Alitalia's troubles, a coalition of other low-cost airlines led by Ryanair sent a letter to the Commission 
this week demanding that Brussels "prevent any attempt by the Italian government to yet again bail out Alitalia 
through state funds". A number of European airlines, including Lufthansa and British Airways, have issued similar 
calls.
The letter refers to recent reports suggesting Alitalia could benefit from measures such as a bridging loan, industry-
wide support, or a capital increase. It states: "Each of these measures, as well as any other form of government 
support for a factually bankrupt airline, constitutes unlawful state aid and should be prohibited under (European) 
state aid rules. Alitalia has utterly failed to restructure and become competitive. Instead, the Italian flag-carrier 
keeps flying at the expense of the Italian taxpayers and to the detriment of competition."
Low-cost airlines gang up on Alitalia
Alitalia said it had seen neither document and was therefore unable to comment. However, it said it was seeking a 
loan from a consortium of banks and that it would abide by European state aid rules.
The carrier was hit by heavy losses last year and in the first quarter of this, and its cash reserves are running low.

Passengers on European budget airlines are looking forward to lower fares this summer. But investors may feel 
less comfortable with the turbulence that lies ahead after low cost carriers (LCCs) such as Ryanair and EasyJet 
opted to cut their fares in a bid to drive out competitors and win market share.
EasyJet has said it will defend its market position vigorously in the current, exceptionally competitive pricing 
environment. "This is a nice way of saying that fares are going through the floor," said Gert Zonneveld at Panmure 
Gordon.
Ryanair and EasyJet have both painted a bleak outlook for the industry. However, their rhetoric is aimed at 
persuading competitors that their losses will grow in the medium term. If other LCCs are unable to build cash 
surpluses over the high-demand summer months, they are more likely to run out of money during the winter.
"Both Ryanair and EasyJet have decided to sacrifice short-term earnings growth in the interest of long-term 
shareholder value by delivering a larger market share of a growing market," said Chris Avery of JP Morgan.
In the longer term, analysts believe the European low cost carrier market will be as large and as profitable as that in 
the US, rewarding long-term shareholders.
US domestic liberalisation of the airline industry began in 1978 and new entrants are still joining the market, as 
plans for a new Virgin-brand airline have shown. European liberalisation began in 1997 and there has been a 
substantial increase in capacity through new entrants, existing LCCs and traditional carriers.
However, many of the new entrants are loss-making and saddled with debt while both Ryanair and EasyJet are 
generating operating profits and have positive net cash on their balance sheet.
Having fewer competitors would allow the survivors to win a bigger slice of a growing pie. LCCs currently account 
for about 20 per cent of the entire short-haul European market and this could rise to about 40 per cent over the next 
five years. In the UK, LCCs currently account for about 40 per cent of the market, with Germany, Italy and Spain 
catching up.
All's fare in war between Europe's budget airlines MARKET INSIGHT:
Potential casualties from a Europe-wide price war could include regional air carriers that were previously insulated 
from competition but now find LCCs flying small jets against their turbo-prop planes. Charter airlines such as 
Britannia and Monarch, which have used some of their charter capacity as part of a low-fare schedule, could find 
themselves exposed. So too could MyTravelLite.com, Deutsche BA, Norwegian, Snowflake and Haapag Lloyd 
Express - part of Tui - the biggest charter airline in Europe.
Clearly, profitability for Ryanair and EasyJet will also suffer in the short term. For the current financial year JP 
Morgan reduced its operating profits forecast for Ryanair by more than a quarter and for EasyJet by more than half. 
The share price declines this year have been equally dramatic, with Dublin's Ryanair down by 31.3 per cent while 
EasyJet shares have dived by 45.4 per cent.
Analysts have taken pains to point out that their forecasts are even less certain than normal. Factors that make 
forecasting problematic are assumptions about fuel costs, changes in the sterling/dollar exchange rate and changes 
in revenues.
Normally, if fares are declining faster than expected, this should lead to increased volumes, but how these two 
counterbalance is uncertain. In such an operationally geared industry, even a 1 per cent change in costs can have a 
significant impact on the bottom line.

Airlines are reacting to the expected rise in the cost of fuel by increasing ticket prices by up to 5% as the 
International Air Transport Association (IATA) warns that hopes for the promised return to profitability could be 
dashed if the trend continues.
IATA director general and chief executive Giovanni Bisignani says that, although passenger traffic for the first four 
months of this year is 15% up on the same period in 2003, the projected hike in fuel costs could add $8-12 billion to 
annual airline fuel costs, "which could strangle our modest projected return to profitability".
He adds that fuel, which accounts for about 16% of airline costs, is 55% more expensive than a year ago. "The 
current crisis resulting from sky-high fuel prices once again highlights the industry's vulnerability to external shocks," 
he says.
Bisignani says the cost-cutting, restructuring and re-engineering carried out by airlines in recent years is not 
enough. "We need to change the whole structure of the industry," he says. IATA will discuss the crisis at its annual 
general meeting in Singapore this week. A spokesman says talks will centre on moves to reduce costs by 
eliminating the monopolies held by many air navigation service providers and airports as well as looking at 
simplifying the business.
Meanwhile, Ryanair president Michael O' Leary dismisses worries over fuel costs as "hysteria", adding: "We believe 
the growth of low-fare air travel will not be damaged or slowed by higher oil prices, which will only hasten the 
demise of some of the current wave of loss-making start-ups and high-fare flag carriers." He says the major airlines' 
decision to impose fuel surcharges "is typical of the anti-consumer mindset of high-fares airlines".

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair is to cut capacity growth this year by not replacing seven aircraft damaged in 
maintenance, as competition in the sector hits the airline's profits.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary says Irish maintenance provider FLS Aerospace has agreed to pay around 
$10 million in compensation to the carrier for the retirement 18 months early of seven Boeing 737-200s, which 
allegedly sustained potentially damaging scribe marks on their fuselages during paint stripping (Flight International, 
10-17 February). O'Leary says the aircraft will not be replaced, taking the carrier's capacity growth from 20% 
forecast to 16% this year. Traffic growth will also slow to 20% over the next 12 months. The airline is receiving 
deliveries of new Boeing 737-800s as part of an 80-firm, 80-option order placed in 2001, with 27 aircraft entering 
service this year.
"In the current competitive situation, it is quite good to have slightly fewer aircraft," says O'Leary. The airline is 
phasing out 13 remaining -200s, which will leave service by December next year, he adds.
Capacity growth could return to forecast levels, however, if International Lease Finance lowers its lease rates for six 
737-300s operated by Ryanair's UK subsidiary Buzz Stansted, he adds. Failure to halve the rates, negotiated by 
previous Buzz owner KLM UK, would result in closure of the unit, says O'Leary.
Ryanair suffered its first fall in profits last year, to [euro]227 million ($272 million) for the year to March compared 
with [euro]239 million for the same period last year. O'Leary says the decline is attributable to the euro/sterling 
exchange rate and a tougher market. "The level of competition we are facing from many new entrants is higher than 
we had thought, and the massive rise in overall capacity has led to a reduction in fare levels across the industry," 
he says.
Ryanair to slow capacity growth; With seven of its Boeing 737-200s due to be retired, the Irish airline has

O'Leary adds the next 12 months will be "a bloodbath" as several loss-making European low-cost carriers will 
cease operations. Joachim Hunold, chief executive of Europe's third largest no-frills carrier Air Berlin, says 
Ryanair's profit declineshows that "increasing passenger numbers by using every technique possible does not lead 
to profits".
O'Leary says the forthcoming crisis in the no-frills sector vindicates Ryanair's decision to opt for a fleet of all-189 
seat 737-800s, rather than a mixed fleet. "Higher seat density reduces the unit cost and lowers our break-even load 
factor, and thus increases our profit margin."

It is little wonder that EasyJet has been punished so hard for over-confidence. Barely a month after its full-year 
results, the low-cost carrier has warned on profits. That hardly inspires trust in the quality of its forecasting. The 
latest downgrade must be particularly galling to the shareholders EasyJet met on a post-results roadshow.
It clearly dents the credibility of the management, led by Ray Webster, chief executive. The management's 
operational expertise is highly regarded but the warning suggests a cultural flaw of over-optimism and a lack of 
understanding of the stockmarket. EasyJet has appeared the Pollyanna of the sector this year in contrast to the 
plain-speaking Ryanair.
Visibility on earnings for low-cost carriers is seldom high but the clouds over the sector, such as mounting 
competition and the spike in oil prices, have been clear for some time. When Ryanair issued a profit warning in 
January, its rival was quick to declare cautious optimism. But EasyJet has been playing catch-up ever since. This 
has been a large factor in EasyJet's 28.5 per cent underperformance against Ryanair in sterling terms since 
January 27, the day before the Irish airline's profit warning.
EasyJet says its latest caution was triggered by the wide spread of profit forecasts after its results. But that only 
serves to underline that it should have been clearer beforehand. Its misunderstanding of the market was also 
highlighted by the fact that management did not initially plan a conference call to investors and analysts about the 
warning. It should be a golden rule that chief executives must be immediately on hand to explain bad news of this 
magnitude.
The extent of EasyJet's underperformance may have been overdone. But given the loss of confidence in its ability 
to manage expectations, the large valuation discount to Ryanair may take time to narrow. Mr Webster last month 
blamed hedge funds for falls in EasyJet's stock. He should look closer to home.

Renewed confidence in sustainable economic growth yesterday helped the London equity market shrug off a profit-
warning from Easyjet that again raised the spectre of high oil prices.
Shares in the budget airline fell 18.6 per cent to 163 1/2p, a whisker above the low of 163p recorded last June. 
Easyjet warned that fuel prices and aggressive competition could affect profitability this year, with high fuel prices 
potentially cutting profits by Pounds 4m.
The airline's latest woes come a month after it warned of a price war and follow rival Ryanair's warning last week of 
an industry "bloodbath" if price cutting continued.
Easyjet yesterday said it would defend vigorously its market position. "This is a nice way of saying that fares are 
going through the floor," said Gert Zonneveld, analyst at Panmure Gordon.
The FTSE 100 closed up 0.8 per cent at 4,491.6, its highest level in a month, with financial stocks the main 
contributors.
The mid-cap FTSE 250 finished 0.5 per cent higher at 6,128.4. Share trading volume was 2.2bn.
Attention focused on a rosier US economic picture following May's non-farm payrolls released on Friday. The data 
show the US economy growing quickly but not fast enough to derail expectations that the Federal Reserve would 
raise rates by only 25 basis points this month.
It is assumed the Bank of England on Thursday will raise rates by the same amount in an effort to stem house 
prices and consumer borrowing without posing a threat to economic recovery.
Prudential, the insurer, was lifted 2.3 per cent to 460 1/2p by persistent talk that it had found buyers for its 79 per 
cent stake in Egg, the internet bank. Egg fell 0.5 per cent to 156p.
Good figures from Aegon, the Dutch insurer, also helped the Pru, as did investors' appetite for cyclical stocks that 
could outperform the market.
EasyJet profit warning fails to damp optimism LONDON:
Barclays rose 1.2 per cent to 488 1/2p as the bank seemed to deliver on its recent pledge to focus on its core retail 
bank. The UK's third- biggest bank is hiring 1,000 cashiers and cutting 800 management and support staff jobs.
Lloyds TSB added 1.6 per cent to 437 3/4p and Royal Bank of Scotland put on 0.6 per cent to Pounds 16.67 on the 
prospect of further consolidation in the European banking sector.
Banking stocks were lifted by Philip Isherwood, global equity strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, who 
highlighted HBOS, up 0.9 per cent at 724p, as well as RBS.
Marks and Spencer rose 1.1 per cent to 361 1/2p with Philip Green reported to be considering improving his 
Pounds 7bn-plus offer for the struggling retailer by making it all cash.
Other retailers continued to be buoyed by takeover speculation. Matalan rose 3.2 per cent to 199 1/2p with 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US buyout firm, supposedly considering a bid.
MFI Furniture added another 1.4 per cent to 161 1/2p on continued talk that it was being stalked by private equity 
groups.
Some scepticism was apparent, however. Richard Ratner, analyst at Seymour Pierce, said the sector could have 
risen too far on the back of M&S. He said now might be a good time to take profits.
Enterprise Inns dropped 3.3 per cent to 569p and Punch Taverns fell 1.9 per cent to 504p as worries resurfaced 
about the Commons trade and industry committee's investigation into beer prices and rents paid by the tenanted 
pub companies' landlords.
Belhaven, however, rose 3 per cent to 446 1/2p as the brewing and pubs company announced better-than-
expected full-year pretax profits. The brewing and pubs company's confident outlook also helped underpin the day's 
gains.
Paladin Resources, the oil exploration company, added 1.2 per cent to 122 1/4p following a North Sea find, which 
provoked an upgrade to "long-term buy" from Cazenove.
Smith & Nephew, the healthcare company, was down 0.2 per at 584p after ING Financial Markets cut its 
recommendation to "hold" from "buy".
Sanctuary, one of Europe's largest independent music companies, rose 1.5 per cent to 49 1/4p on the back of 
interim results that showed stronger-than-expected revenue growth.
Ark Therapeutics rose 6.1 per cent to 105p as its brain cancer treatment showed an 81 per cent increase in life 
expectancy.
Shares in Inter-Alliance were up 62.5 per cent at 1p after the financial services company said it was in merger talks 
with Millfield, steady at 59 1/2p.

The share tumble that greeted EasyJet's results last month left Ray Webster, the airline's chief executive, shell-
shocked. The furious reaction from investors and analysts following a second warning on profits yesterday may well 
leave him wondering how secure his job is.
The anger and dismay was palpable around the City yesterday after the airline disclosed it had misread the impact 
of the ongoing price war in the sector and the rising cost of fuel.
To make matters worse, investors and shareholders trying to get further clarification from the company about the 
trading update were told Mr Webster was in Singapore at an annual airline trade association event. Meanwhile, 
Chris Walton, the finance director, was in meetings.
The reaction was immediate, sending the shares down by about 20 per cent from 200 3/4p to 163 1/2p, leaving 
long-term holders of EasyJet shares with a stake whose value has halved in a month.
This reaction represented more than just a correction as analysts slashed their profits forecasts for this year and 
next in half. It was also a signal to management that they may have pushed the patience of the City too far.
"This announcement will cause further significant damage to EasyJet's management credibility," said one large 
shareholder, who listed among the other concerns an overpayment for Go, the low-cost airline bought from British 
Airways, and mismanagement of capacity.
"I see no positive news on the horizon so it is likely that for the next nine to 12 months the shares will trade below 
their net asset value, which I estimate is 200p, reflecting the significant damage to their credibility," he added.
Another analyst, who has been highly supportive of EasyJet in the past, was equally angry as he had to face clients 
demanding to know why he had not seen it coming after the airline had warned of pressure on yields.
EasyJet caught in a City headwind: A second profit warning left analysts and investors pondering the future of 
the low-cost airline's chief executive, writes Ma....
"Management actually laughed at us when we suggested second-half yields might be down by 5 per cent just four 
weeks ago. Now they are telling us it is 10 per cent and are not discounting a 15 per cent fall in the fourth quarter. I 
am very upset," he said.
He added Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder and single largest shareholder of EasyJet, should consider changes.
How the company steered analysts in the past few weeks - and questions over whether analysts should have 
reacted more robustly than downgrading their forecasts by just 15 per cent after the interims - is a valid concern 
among investors.
The belated reaction follows repeated warnings this year from Ryanair, the market leader in the low-cost sector with 
EasyJet.
Michael O'Leary, the Irish carrier's chief executive not known for mincing his words, repeated his warning at the 
time of its results last week.
He said the market should prepare for a bloodbath as the two dominant players take on the mounting competition 
from droves of upstarts across Europe.
"In contrast to the usual outspoken Mr O'Leary who has been warning us all for some time of the consequences of 
increased competition, all we got from EasyJet at the interims was of a modest decline in yield. Now all of a sudden 
it's much more than modest," the shareholder said.
In a sign of how far relations have deteriorated, one of the the most positive comments yesterday came from Chris 
Avery, airline analyst at JP Morgan.
In a research note, which saw him cut the forecast for this year from a pre-tax profit of Pounds 98.3m to Pounds 
52.1m, he wrote: "The stock has fallen a long way (as have earnings estimates), but we believe that the company is 
building long-term shareholder value at the expense of shorter-term profitability.
"We see few fresh catalysts, hence it might be better this summer to benefit from EasyJet's business model as a 
passenger." Investors may want more than a cheap flight to address their concerns.

Leading London shares made gains today, boosted by a surge in Abbey National stocks on bid speculation.
At the closing bell, the FTSE 100 was up 15.60 points to 4,507.20.
The financial sector drove London's main index into positive territory today with Abbey National leading the pack 
amid speculation that it will be the target of a takeover bid after Lloyds TSB urged the British government to relax its 
rules on domestic banking mergers. Both Lloyds and Spain's largest bank, Santander Central Hispano, whose offer 
Abbey National had previously rejected, are seen as possible bidders for the mortgage bank. Abbey's shares 
jumped 7.25p to 475. Lloyds TSB stocks dipped 0.5p to 437.25 while Royal Bank of Scotland shares rose by 20p to 
1,687.
 EasyJet, Ryanair's main European competitor, saw its shares slide a further 2.1 or 3.5p to 160 after yesterday's 
profit warning, which sent the shares tumbling down nearly 19pc. UBS downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "buy" 
and lowered its price target to 165p from 350p. Ryanair shares were down 2c to 452.

Telecoms firm Energis Ireland, which was formerly known as Nevada tele.com, has posted a pre-tax loss of E2.86m 
for the year to March 31, 2004.
The firm, which supplies telecoms services to a range of corporate customers in the Republic, made a loss of 
E32.8m in the previous year due to writing off the value of its telecoms assets.
Turnover at the firm, which employs about 50 staff in Dublin, increased to E33.2m, compared to E24.6m a year 
earlier.
 Accumulated losses at Energis stand at E60.6m and the firm's auditors, KPMG, noted that a situation existed that 
may require the convening of an extraordinary general meeting. However, the latest figures show that the company 
has recovered from a restructuring during 2003, when British firm Energis assumed full control after buying out a 
50pc share owned by the electricity company Viridian. At the end of March 2003 Energis employed 47 staff, 
compared to the 68 staff it employed a year earlier. This enabled the firm to cut staffing costs to E3.06m from 
E3.3m. Last week Energis Ireland appointed a new general manager, Conal Henry, the former commercial director 
of Ryanair, to help build the firm.

Gol Linhas Aereas, a Brazilian airline, is hoping to raise Dollars 300m in an initial public offering on the Sao Paulo 
and New York stock exchanges this month.
The deal will help finance Gol's expansion plan, which includes the acquisition of 47 new Boeing 737 aircraft to 
more than treble its fleet by the end of 2010.
It is the third Brazilian IPO announcement in less than two weeks after a two-year dearth, and could signal a new 
trend among mid-sized Brazilian companies, which have been previously shut out from Brazil's fledgling capital 
market.
"This is the reaction to an improved investment and growth outlook for Brazilian companies," said Fernando Iunes, 
head of capital markets at the Itau BBA, the investment bank.
Last week Natura, a cosmetics company, had a successful IPO, and ALL, Latin America's largest transport 
company, said it would soon follow suit.
Unlike corporate heavy weights such as Petrobras or Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the oil and iron ore companies 
respectively, numerous efficient mid-sized companies have seen their growth potential capped because of high 
capital costs. If the recent trend of IPOs continues, several Brazilian companies could be leveraged to fast-track 
growth, analysts argue.
Though moderate in size and number by international standards, the recent IPOs could trigger a snowball effect in 
Brazil, analysts said. "One successful deal often leads to another," said Sergio Zappa, executive director for capital 
markets with Unibanco, a local bank.
In the three years since its inception, Gol has grabbed more than 20 per cent of the domestic Brazilian airline 
market, defying sceptics who argued a no-frills airline would not work in Brazil. Last year it saw a profit margin of 37 
per cent, the second largest in the global airline industry, behind Ryanair, the Irish budget airline.
Gol plans IPO as part of expansion AIRLINES:
Gol, which will offer more than 33m preferential shares, refrained from offering ordinary shares, which carry a voting 
right. Under Brazilian law foreigners can own only limited stakes in airlines.
AIG, the US insurer, will be selling half of its 12.5 per cent stake in the airline. Morgan Stanley will be bookrunner 
and global co-ordinator for Gol's international share offer and Merrill Lynch will be co-ordinator.

It may only be spring but the foreboding over the coming winter in the low-cost airline sector has set in. The 
summer peak in travel is expected to give way to a brutal bout of discounting aimed at filling seats. 
Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, expects a bloodbath as loss-making, more marginal carriers are 
forced out of the industry. A fair bit of this warning may be aimed at deterring further additions to the plethora of new 
low-cost carriers around Europe. But the competitive pressures are real enough.
This will present opportunities for Ryanair in the long run. Its strong balance sheet, with Euros 1.2bn of cash, should 
see it ride out the turbulence and take advantage of rivals' weaknesses to snap up routes and, possibly, cheap 
aircraft. But it is vulnerable to a short-term blow to profitability. The airline is expecting a decline in average fares of 
about 7 to 8 per cent over this fiscal year although winter will be much more severe. That seems realistic and 
Ryanair has a record of erring on the side of blunt conservatism in forecasts.
But a concern is that the decline in average fares is coinciding with upward pressure on costs. Ryanair expects to 
cut unit costs by about 5 per cent this year. However, that is tough, given increases in fuel bills, depreciation on 
aircraft and airport charges. Such clouds over Ryanair's outlook may provide buying opportunities for long-term 
investors but add to the near-term uncertainties.

Ryanair, the largest European low-cost airline, suffered its first drop in profits in 15 years last year and fell into loss 
in the final quarter, including exceptional charges, for the first time since flotation in 1997.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, warned that average fares would again fall sharply this year and repeated his 
forecast of a looming "bloodbath" in the low-cost sector.
Many of the group's loss-making competitors across Europe would "dump prices to try to stay alive" next winter, he 
said. "There will be more airline casualties next winter, a process that has already started in recent months with the 
closure of four airlines in Ireland, the UK and Scandinavia."
Ryanair remains one of the world's most profitable airlines, however, in spite of the decline in its net profit margin 
from 28.4 to 19.2 per cent last year.
Net profits fell by 13.7 per cent in the year to March to Euros 206.6m (Pounds 137.3m) from Euros 239.4m, 
including total non-recurring costs and goodwill charges of Euros 19.9m. It made a net loss in the final quarter of 
Euros 3.3m (including exceptionals), down from a net profit of Euros 45.3m a year earlier.
Ryanair has been the worst performer in the FTSE Eurotop 300 index since the beginning of the year following its 
January profits warning. The share price closed 4 cents lower at Euros 4.34 compared with a 12-month peak of 
Euros 7.59 in late January.
Mr O'Leary forecast a further fall in yields or average fares of 5-10 per cent this summer and of 10-20 per cent next 
winter.
Ryanair's average fares fell by 14 per cent last year and by 22 per cent in the final quarter.
Some analysts lowered earnings estimates for the current year yesterday. Chris Avery, of JP Morgan, forecast a 
drop in net profits this year to Euros 162m, down from the previous forecast of Euros 222m. "Ryanair is piling on the 
low fare pressure on the European airline industry in pursuit of long-term market position at the expense of short-
term earnings growth," he said.
Ryanair suffers first net profit drop in 15 years
The airline is slowing its rate of growth sharply, however, with capacity forecast to grow by 16 per cent only this 
year compared with annual growth of about 50 per cent in each of the past two years.
Passenger volumes are forecast to grow by about 20 per cent in the year to March 2005.
Mr O'Leary said higher oil prices would not damage the growth of low-fare air travel but would hasten the demise of 
some "loss-making start-ups and high-fare flag carriers". Lex, Page 20 Ryanair warns of bloodbath, Page 26

A widely expected spike in oil prices put European equity markets under pressure yesterday although Wall Street's 
early resilience helped keep sentiment on a relatively even keel.
By the close, the FTSE Eurotop 300 index was down 0.8 per cent at 978.99.
The rise in crude prices initially boosted oil and gas stocks, with Norway's Statoil leading the way with a rise of 3 per 
cent to NKr87 following reports that Smith Barney, Citigroup's research arm, had upgraded the stock from "hold" to 
"buy".
Norsk Hydro rose 1.4 per cent to NKr422.50 but Repsol YPF ended 1 per cent lower at Euros 17.21 and Total 
edged back 0.3 per cent to Euros 154.60.
Energy-sensitive sectors such as airlines ran into some selling pressure. Spain's Iberia fell 2.1 per cent to Euros 
2.31 and Air France slipped 0.2 per cent to Euros 13.09 but Lufthansa recovered early losses to close unchanged 
at Euros 11.60.
The carrier said yesterday it had priced its new shares at the Euros 9.85 minimum it had set for a rights issue, 
indicating that the German stock market remains a tough place to raise funds.
Ryanair, the Irish budget airline, fell 1.8 per cent to Euros 4.30 in Dublin in spite of reporting slightly better-than-
forecast annual results.
The car sector was also weaker. Renault fell 2.9 per cent to Euros 59.15, while DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen 
each fell 1.5 per cent to Euros 36.10 and Euros 35.24, respectively.
However, Fiat ended higher following several days of turbulent trading as it confirmed the appointment of Sergio 
Marchionne as its new chief executive, replacing Giuseppe Morchio, who resigned suddenly at the weekend.
Mr Marchionne was formerly chief executive at Swiss goods inspection company SGS. Mr Morchio quit the 
company in protest after the chairmanship of Fiat was given to Ferrari chief Luca di Montezemolo following the 
Boardroom shake-up lifts Fiat EUROPE:
death of Umberto Agnelli last week. Fiat shares finished the day as the Eurotop 300's best performer with a gain of 
4.6 per cent to Euros 6.
Analysts said the stock price had reacted to the speed with which Fiat had acted to fill the power vacuum at the 
company, as well as hopes that Mr Marchionne would be able to keep the company's restructuring on track.
Meanwhile, SGS shares tumbled 8.3 per cent to SFr662. Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock from "buy" to "hold" 
and lowered its price target to SFr720 from SFr850. "The departure of Marchionne would, in our opinion, be taken 
negatively by the market," said Pascal Moura at Deutsche Bank.
Shares in Adecco bucked the market's weaker trend as investors breathed a sigh of relief that the group had finally 
released its long-delayed 2003 results and said no restatement of previous earnings would be required.
The company shocked investors in January when it revealed that it had discovered accounting problems centred on 
its north American operations. The news sent Adecco's share price tumbling and the group's reputation took a 
mauling.
Adecco still faces class action lawsuits from investors who claim they were misguided by the company and are 
looking to recover investment losses. Yesterday, the shares rose 3.9 per cent to SFr62.75, still well off a 2004 intra-
day high of SFr83.75 but above a low of SFr42.70.
Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone maker, shed 3 per cent to Euros 11.09. Worries about the company's market share 
prompted ratings agency Fitch to change its credit rating outlook on Nokia from "stable" to "negative".
The weak dollar hit Dutch retailer Ahold, which has huge US exposure. Shares fell 4.3 per cent to Euros 6.08.

Ryanair's capacity bingeof the past two years is over and Europe's largest low-cost carrier is seeking to fly out of 
the turbulence it has been encountering in recent months.
Michael O'Leary is still keen to talk about the bloodbath to come, as the low-cost airline sector in Europe 
consolidates and many of the recent crop of lossmaking start-up carriers go out of business.
The message is partly designed to deter yet more new entrants. But Ryanair is also pulling in its horns. Last year's 
55 per cent capacity increase was over-ambitious, ate into margins and left many seats unsold even at give-away 
prices.
Average fares last year fell by 14 per cent and in the worst of the winter months from January to March this year 
they were down by 22 per cent.
Hence the January profit warning, the first since flotation in May 1997, which led to a 31 per cent one-day fall in the 
share price.
In the event, the results announced yesterday were not quite as bad as some had feared.
Mr O'Leary had forecast in January a fall in yields in the final quarter of between 25 and 30 per cent, compared with 
the outcome of a 22 per cent decline.
But the airline still had to disclose its first fall in annual profits since 1989 and its first quarterly loss, including 
exceptional charges and goodwill, since flotation.
So Mr O'Leary is seeking calmer air. The rise in capacity for the current year to the end of March 2005 could be as 
little as 16 per cent, and Mr O'Leary said at such growth levels he was confident of filling the seats.
Ryanair warns of bloodbath as it heads for smoother air: Michael O'Leary sends a chilling message to start-up 
carriers, reports Kevin Done
The results are already becoming visible in the monthly traffic figures, with yesterday's statistics for May showing a 
much more modest rise of 19 per cent year-on-year in passenger volumes.
As a result the load factor, the share of seats filled, rose to 81 per cent from 77 per cent a year ago.
And in spite of the present rough ride the airline remains one of the most profitable carriers in the world with net 
margins last year of 19 per cent.
British Airways hopes one day to reach operating margins of 10 per cent. Last year it was just over 5 per cent.
But Mr O'Leary accepts that the years of consistently stellar profits growth are probably over. "We are now so big, 
we can no longer fly under the radar as a niche airline," he said yesterday. The airline's fortunes were much more 
likely to follow the track of the wider industry.
"We do not walk on water," he said and accepted that the "mythical aura of infallibility" surrounding the airline was 
no more.
Last year the group had faced "adverse" market conditions, he said, including sterling weakness, the war in Iraq, 
the threat of terrorist attacks, significantly higher oil prices and "intense price competition all over Europe from 
chronically lossmaking flag carriers and new entrant carriers, most of whom are losing money on an enormous 
scale."
Ryanair's net profits fell last year by 13.7 per cent from Euros 239.4m to Euros 206.6m (Pounds 137.6m), including 
total non-recurring costs and goodwill charges of Euros 19.9m. It made a net loss in the final quarter of Euros 3.3m, 
compared with a net quarterly profit of Euros 45.3m a year earlier.
Group turnover rose by 28 per cent in the year to the end of March from Euros 842.5m to Euros 1.1bn.
Mr O'Leary was cautious over forecasts for the current year, but his working assumption of a further 7-8 per cent fall 
in yields, and brutally tough competition next winter, could indicate a second year of declining net profits. He is also 
hoping that plans for paid-for, in-flight entertainment may offer new revenues.
Also, the growing number of new, fuel-efficient, larger-capacity aircraft in the fleet and cheaper airport deals may 
help to reduce costs.

Oil-sensitive stocks were hit by another spike in the crude price yesterday following the weekend attacks in Saudi 
Arabia.
British Airways was one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100. Its exposure to any increase in fuel costs saw the 
shares shed 2.4 per cent to 248p. The stock was also hit by a downbeat outlook from Ryanair, the Irish discount 
airline.
Rolls-Royce dropped 1.8 per cent to 221 3/4p on worries about weaker demand for its airline engines.
The FTSE 100 fell 0.2 per cent to 4,422.7 and the mid-cap FTSE 250 was off 0.4 per cent at 6,026.5, with trading 
volume 2.2bn.
The fall in the two indices was limited by the boost many oil stocks received from the higher crude price. BP added 
0.9 per cent to 482p and BG Group rose by 1 per cent to 335 1/4p. Shell held steady at 394 1/4p.
The mid-cap oil and gas exploration companies also made solid gains in the FTSE 250. Tullow Oil rose by 4.1 per 
cent to 107p, Cairn Energy was unchanged at Pounds 10.54 and First Calgary gained 14.1 per cent to 495p after 
striking oil in Algeria.
Marks and Spencer was up 1.7 per cent at 365 1/2p after the ailing retailer showed it was prepared to fight Philip 
Green's expected Pounds 4 a share formal offer. M&S bowed to shareholder pressure by hiring Stuart Rose as 
chief executive and Paul Myners as interim chairman.
The appointment of Mr Rose was well received. In the event of Mr Green's bid failing, the forecast for the level to 
which the shares would fall was raised to 320p, because the new chief executive was expected to turn M&S round.
Geest, the food company, was hit by profit-taking and fell 3.4 per cent to 565p. The shares rose 14 per cent on 
Friday when Bakkavor, an Icelandic food group, raised its stake to 10.27 per cent. But the Icelandic group said it 
had no intentions of making a formal bid.
British heavyweights bear the brunt of fuel costs LONDON:
ICI, the speciality chemicals group, gained 1.2 per cent to 221 1/2p after UBS upgraded the stock to "buy" from 
"neutral" and raised its price target to 260p, nearly 40p higher than its current price.
UBS said that ICI Paints faced a better demand environment that should allow it to implement price increases to 
make up for the rising cost of raw materials. The stock also trades on a cheap 2005 price/earnings ratio of 8.2, 
compared with the average of 13.1 for its European peers.
Cable & Wireless fell 1.6 per cent to 121 1/2p ahead of its full-year results today as Lehman Brothers cut its price 
target from 165p to 140p because of adverse currency movements and a challenging outlook for its Caribbean 
business.
Lehman, however, expected resilient domestic revenues, with the recent Bulldog acquisition signalling C&W's intent 
to improve its revenue mix.
Vodafone and MMO, the mobile phone operators, shed 1 per cent to 127p and 1.5 per cent to 96p, respectively, 
after Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, ordered the fees mobile phone companies impose on landline operators for 
connecting calls to their networks to be cut by a third.
SABMiller lost 1.4 per cent to 650p after its US rival Anheuser-Busch topped the UK brewer's hostile Dollars 550m 
offer for Harbin Brewery, the Chinese beer maker.
Anheuser-Busch bid Dollars 720m and SABMiller will have to increase its initial offer if it wants to win the bid battle.
HHG, the life insurance company, was among the mid-cap leaders, rising 4.1 per cent to 44 3/4p after receiving an 
upgrade from UBS to "buy" from "neutral". UBS said that it saw further scope to enhance value in HHG's life 
services division. It also forecast improvements at Henderson, HHG's fund manager, following recovery in equity 
markets and improved margins.
Provalis, the biotech company, added 14.4 per cent to 7p after it reported its G5 diabetes diagnostics test was 
nearing the end of clinical trials. The company was confident of launching the drug in the US and Europe this 
autumn and, as a consequence, said it had established its own US sales force to market the drug.
Estates & General, the property investment company, gained 18.8 per cent to 252 1/2p as it agreed to a bid from 
the property group Winten of 255p in cash, valuing Estates & General at Pounds 70.7m.
Carillion, the construction company, fell 0.7 per cent to 165 1/2p even though it will receive Pounds 17.6m for 
transferring its rail maintenance assets to Network Rail, owner of the railway network. The problem for Carillion is 
that lost track repair contracts will reduce operating profits by Pounds 7m this year and by Pounds 15m next year.

Europe's largest no-frills airline, Ryanair, has warned of a potential "bloodbath" in the low-cost airlines industry next 
winter.
Ryanair's deputy chief executive Michael Cawley predicted that the difficulties faced by the airline industry would 
continue for the rest of the year and that air fares would fall further.
"We think there's going to be an absolute bloodbath next winter. Fares are only going one way and only the airline 
with the lowest costs will win. Ryanair will be the last man standing," he said.
 The statement came as Ryanair posted profits for the year to the end of March that was in line but considerably 
down on the previous year. The airline reported a 14 fall in pre-tax profits to E228 million in the year and suggested 
that, at best, it would bring in profits of just over E200 million in 2005. After-tax profits fell 5pc to E226m, slightly 
ahead of market expectations. "We think there's going to be an absolute bloodbath next winter. Fares are only 
going one way and only the airline with the lowest costs will win. Ryanair will be the last man standing," he said.

Body
The latest attacks by Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary on Taoiseach Bertie Ahern are part of a blatant 
attempt to bully the Government into breaking up Aer Rianta and must be resisted, according to the TEEU.
The regional secretary of the union, Arthur Hall, said, "Full page adverts in national newspapers attacking Bertie 
Ahern are not only offensive and disingenuous but seek to undermine the democratic process and social 
partnership, which has brought so much prosperity to Ireland."
"He has produced absolutely no evidence to suggest that if Aer Rianta was broken up, and Ryanair allowed to 
develop a terminal at Dublin airport, he could create 5,000 new jobs. In fact O'Leary's plan would actually cost jobs 
because building his terminal would require the demolition of the FLS hangars and the airport garage, as well as the 
airport church," he added.
 Hall also claimed that any jobs Ryanair did create would be of the "race to the bottom" variety that would displace 
existing good quality employment at the airport.

Michael O'Leary is flying across uncharted terrain. The garrulous Ryanair boss has already had to issue a profits 
warning this year. Yesterday Observer's man in the cockpit detected a trace of humility from the great navigator.
O'Leary fielded the usual questions about whether he would sell any of his shares in Ryanair (he generally says no, 
then does).
He would not be selling just now "because the share price is too low", he said. And this time Observer believed him: 
the Irish low-cost airline is the worst performer in the FTSE Eurotop 300 index.
Still, O'Leary defended his strategy. He told "whingeing shareholders" that "if you are not happy, sell them yourself".
With a stake of just over five per cent he was "the biggest loser last year". But as O'Leary ruled out paying any 
dividends to compensate there was the merest hint of a mea culpa. "This is a capital growth stock. We have 
singularly failed to deliver this year," he admitted.
A big change for the man who once dressed up as the pope. Observer is ready to hear his confession any time.

Fact: there will be no more cheap fuel. Airlines will just have to get used to it, because betting that oil prices will go 
down any time soon could be the last mistake they ever make.
For the world's oil buyers, last year's fear - of possible supply disruption caused by the war in Iraq - has been 
replaced by this year's certainty. The attacks in Saudi Arabia in May are merely the latest in a series of terrorist 
actions in that country which will inevitably keep fuel prices high. Airlines must realize that the old remedies will no 
longer work - and that finding new ones must be their highest priority. The catalogue of threats is well known: the 
rapidly growing economies of China and east Asia are thirsty for oil, and the Chinese government's decision to 
create a strategic oil reserve has aggravated the situation. 
Political unrest in Nigeria and Venezuela has endangered supplies. Continual bombings and shootings in Iraq are 
slowing the post-war reconstruction of the country's oil infrastructure - and the Saudi authorities seem incapable of 
securing their oil industry, the world's largest, or the lives of the foreign workers on whom it depends. Airlines 
around the world followed each other last month in announcing price rises to pass on the increased cost - a tactic 
that would have worked 20 years ago. But with far more competition in the global airline market, the carriers were 
quickly forced back on their tracks to avoid being undercut by their better-prepared rivals. The fuel surcharges 
lasted mere days. If the problem were simply a brief spike in fuel prices, airlines could simply prepare to ride it out. 
But few have the financial strength, and few would be willing to bet that the problem will be short-lived. Even 
Ryanair admits that it will be forced to cut costs if fuel prices remain high in the second half of the year - a tall order 
for an airline whose unit costs are already among the lowest in the industry. It would also be dangerous to bet on an 
imminent fall in prices. Even with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) calling for a two million 
barrel per day increase in production, oil buyers are justified in asking whether the increase will be enough, given 
that cartel members already routinely exceed their quotas; the Saudi terrorist threat raises the question of the ability 
of even a willing Saudi Arabia to raise production. Opec ministers complained before the meeting that the fear of 
terrorism and interruptions in supply had "driven the market beyond the law of supply and demand", casting doubt 
on how effective an increase would be. Part of the problem for many carriers is that they entered the new year with 
the faulty belief that the fuel situation was set to improve, and were insufficiently hedged during the rise that 
followed. Many run the risk of repeating this mistake later this year by writing a fall in fuel prices into their business 
plans. There is little evidence to support such an upbeat view. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal 
Reserve, famously castigated investors in the late 1990s for indulging in "irrational optimism". Airlines risk falling 
into the same trap. In fuel purchasing, they must have a burst of rational pessimism. In the short term, this will mean 
increasing their hedge positions: there is no reason at all why further attacks should not drive fuel prices higher yet. 
Airlines may find that shortage of cash or credit quality will drive them to joint purchasing with their better-heeled

alliance partners. In the longer term, they should consider how they will cope with permanently high fuel costs: 
because neither denial, nor petulance, nor optimism will work.Alexander Campbell

Close shave for RAF transport
 
Staff
The UK Royal Air Force has launched an investigation into a mid-air collision involving one of its Lockheed Martin 
C-130J transports and an unidentified combat aircraft in Turkmenistan airspace on 22 May. En route from 
Afghanistan to Bucharest, Romania, the RAF aircraft diverted to Baku, Azerbaijan after sustaining damage to two 
propeller blades on its number four engine. It was still undergoing repair late last week. "The C-130J crew was in 
contact with Turkmen air traffic control and all aircraft systems were functioning at the time of the incident," says the 
RAF.
Pipers grounded over metal fears
 
Staff
New Piper has grounded 76 aircraft that may incorporate structural components made from a batch of sheet steel 
that was not heat-treated properly before delivery earlier this year. Of the aircraft potentially affected, 39 are with 
customers and the rest still at dealers and the factory. All models are affected. Piper is testing each aircraft and has 
already cleared some, but will have to repair those found to have the defective components.
 
Voting row threatens creation of EDA

Briefing
The creation of a European Union military procurement and project co-ordination body is threatened by a row over 
voting rights. Talks between national teams establishing the European Defence Agency (EDA) are understood to 
have stalled over the right to retain national vetoes. The agency's creation team, led by Nick Whitney, has been 
suspended and the matter referred to foreign ministers. It remains unclear how the voting process of the agency's 
steering board, comprising member states' defence ministers, Whitney and a European Commission 
representative, will work.
 
Cessna 400 series gains reprieve
 
Staff
Expensive proposed airworthiness directives (AD) that could have grounded Cessna 400-series twins have been 
withdrawn by the US Federal Aviation Administration under pressure from owner organisations. Inspection and 
installation of a Cessna wing-spar strap kit was estimated to cost $75,000.  The FAA plans to reissue the ADs after 
alternative solutions have been developed.
 
Ryanair fights back on Charleroi ruling
 
Staff
Ryanair is appealing against the European Commission ruling that the airline has to pay back illegal subsidies it 
received from Brussels Charleroi airport. Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary says the EC ruling puts 
government-run airports at a disadvantage becauseprivately owned airports can offer more interesting conditions. 
However, as it willtake another 20 months before the EC will be able to react, Ryanair will continue flying from 
Charleroi, although it has dropped its daily service from Charleroi to London Stansted. The airline has also 
discontinued its daily London Stansted-Ostend Bruges service.
 
SkyTeam Signs MoU With Aeroflot
 
Staff
Russian flag carrier Aeroflot moved a step closer to full alliance membership last week, when it signed a 
memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Air France/Delta Air Lines-led SkyTeam. The MoU is a preliminary step 
in the membership process and commits Aeroflot to exclusive discussions with SkyTeam, and guarantees eventual 
membership, subject to the carrier meeting Skyteam's joining conditions.
 
Aerolineas renews fleet

Aerolineas Argentinas has announced plans to replace its current fleet of 32 Boeing 737-200 aircraft with an equal 
number of 737-300 and 737-500 aircraft. The company is still discussing how many of each 737 derivative will be 
introduced to the fleet, but deliveries are due to start almost immediately. The carrier will also receive another three

Airbus and Boeing are the greatest of rivals, but the European manufacturer will face new opposition come August. 
Airbus UK, the works soccer team, has just won promotion to Wales' top division. Last season it was called the JT 
Hughes Mitsubishi Welsh Premier League, but it has just signed a £50,000 sponsorship deal and will be known this 
year as the, wait for it, Vauxhall Masterfit Retailers Welsh Premier League.
The Broughton-based side, half of which works for Airbus, with the remainder coming from outside, swept away all 
comers in the Cymru Alliance, losing just one of its 32 matches. Its 27 wins left the team 19 points ahead of the 
trailing pack. The club was formed in 1946 and it is no surprise that its nickname is the "Planemakers" or 
"Wingmakers" - it has at various times been named Vickers-Armstrong, de Havillands, Hawker Siddeley, British 
Aerospace and BAE Systems. The club receives financial support not only from the manufacturer but also from 
outside sponsors. You would imagine that a team named Airbus would be strong on the wings, although they 
appear literally so as this is part of the aircraft that many of their players, assemblers and fitters, work on. Their first 
few weeks in the top flight could be difficult as the club's games will be "away" at Conwy United because of 
renovations to its Broughton stadium. Mind you, this might not be too much of a hindrance as Airbus went the whole 
of last season without an away defeat. Part of the redevelopment includes putting in retractable floodlights so they 
can be raised and lowered for games because, ironically, its ground is close to a runway at Hawarden airport. It has 
won its first battle, though. Barry Town, the fallen giants of the Welsh leagues, had appealed against thes ground-
sharing plan in a hope to avoid relegation, but this was thrown out by the Football Association of Wales. Airbus 
UK's first league game will be at nearby Newtown AFC on August 14. 'We are looking at holding our own for the 
first season," the club's chairman, John Sutton, a site services coordinator at Airbus, told Airfinance Journal. He is 
confident of making an impact in the longer term, especially after seeing how well previous promoted teams had 
fared. Airbus UK will not be the only branded team in the league. Total Network Solutions, supported by the 
computer networking company, is already established. It finished runners-up to champions Rhyl and will be playing 
in Europe next season. But then, Airbus can claim to have been playing on the world stage for almost 40 
years.O'Leary versus French
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary is used to upsetting other airlines but few answer back. So top marks to Jim French, 
managing director of the small but increasingly profitable UK low-cost airline Flybe.O'Leary said: "It remains our 
medium-term view that [similar to Southwest in the US] there will only be one or possibly two large low-fare airlines 
in Europe and we are determined that the biggest and lowest cost of these carriers will be Ryanair." But French 
decided to fight back for all the small guys, replying: "If you want to know how to turn around your winter losses of 
£2.3 million, Mr O'Leary, give us a call. We stand ready and willing to help." In fact, O'Leary does not need to call. 
Both Ryanair and FlyBe are members of the European Low Fares Airline Association so can no doubt discuss the 
Airbus makes it into the top flight
matter over a drink at their next meeting. Let's hope Wolfgang Kurth, the association's chairman, can keep the two 
of them from each other's throats. O'Leary said last year that he was willing "to break the law if necessary" to get 
Ryanair operating in France. Heaven knows what he's getting ready to break now.Trouble in the US
ore delicate sarcasm this summer from the US Air Transportation Stabilisation Board, which turned down United's 
second bid for a loan guarantee (see "UAL gets another one-month extension," page 15). The reason it gave was 
that United had improved so much that it should have no problem raising the money without a guarantee. In fact, 
the board said (well, more or less) the lenders should be fighting for the chance to put money into such a promising 
business. United, like the rest of the residents of Planet Earth, disagreed. In fact, by the end of the day it had written 
back to ask the board to reconsider. No word from the board so far. Although the board may be being unhelpful, 
other arms of the US government are doing their bit for the airline industry. The Pentagon has just discovered that it 
has accidentally wasted $100 million on airline tickets it didn't use and for which it didn't bother to claim refunds. 
The airlines presumably appreciate the gesture, although the Pentagon will have to be a lot more careless to get 
United back on its feet. Elsewhere, Continental Airlines has suspended six employees who were accused of 
bringing hundreds of kilograms of cocaine into Newark International Airport, earning themselves millions of dollars 
in profit. However, it is keeping on the rest of its workforce, who have been bringing thousands of tonnes of (entirely 
legal) payload into Newark but not earning the airline a dime of profit in the process. It is this sort of lack of focus on 
the bottom line that is hurting the industry so badly.

Ryanair profits fell for the financial year to March 31, 2004 with the Irish low-cost carrier blaming higher fuel costs 
and the expense of expanding its fleet and route network. For the first time since its flotation in 1997, the airline 
made a net loss in the fourth quarter of the year, and full-year net profits were down to 227 million [euro] ($275 
million) compared with 239 million [euro] in financial 2003.
The airline's share price was largely unaffected, after falling sharply on a profit warning earlier this year.
Despite the steady rise in fuel prices over the first half of 2004, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary is confident that they 
will fall later in the year, and has decided not to hedge the airline's fuel purchasing beyond the end of September 
2004, saying that the high forward price makes it unattractive.
Ryanair will not hedge again until prices fall, which O'Leary expects to happen in late 2004 or early 2005. If not, he 
warns, the airline will be forced to cut costs to compensate. Given Ryanair's already low-cost base, this could 
involve delaying aircraft deliveries, which would hit the airline's expansion plans--it aims at 20% passenger growth 
and 16% capacity growth over the year to March 2005.
The airline also revealed the financial effect of the early retirement of six 737-200s last year, because of damage 
during repainting which reduced the hull life. The loss of residual value and the cost of leasing in temporary 
replacement capacity was, at 13.3 million [euro], more than double Ryanair's original estimate of 5 million [euro], 
but, says the airline, there are no more early retirements to come.(c) Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC This

Highlight: low cost airlines

alexander campbell / london
One part of Europe where low-cost carriers (LCC) have had a significant impact on traditional inclusive-tour 
operators as well as more business-oriented regional airlines is Germany. A powerful economy, 82 million citizens 
and a demand for air travel that rivals the UK have made it a fertile breeding ground for low-cost start-ups, some of 
them owned by the travel giants themselves.
The country latched onto the low-cost revolution later than the UK, with Ryanair establishing a foothold at Frankfurt 
Hahn airport in early 2002. Since then, at least five German operators have entered the market. So too has 
Ryanair's UK rival EasyJet, which set up a base at the former East Berlin airport, Schonefeld, late last year and has 
since added a second hub in Dortmund.
When Ryanair moved into Germany, its outspoken chief executive Michael O'Leary famously taunted the flag 
carrier with "Auf Wiedersehn Lufthansa" slogans on its aircraft and boasted it would shake up a cosy marketplace 
dominated by high-fare German airlines. Referring to Lufthansa then-chief executive Jurgen Weber's claim that 
Germans "do not like low fares", O'Leary retorted: "How does he know? He's never offered them any. The Germans 
will crawl naked over broken glass to get them." Lufthansa dismissed the threat, saying German consumers would 
be reluctant to compromise on full-service frills and to fly from Ryanair's remote airfields (Hahn is more than 100km 
(62 miles) from Frankfurt city centre).
Ryanair - which operates 19 routes from Hahn and flies to seven other German locations - may not have bid 
Lufthansa goodbye, but it appears German consumers have snatched at the low-cost opportunity, with the Irish 
airline's entrance paving the way for other no-frills carriers. Their emergence has hit Lufthansa hard, especially on 
its domestic routes. Earlier this year Lufthansa Regional senior vice-president Werner Knorr complained that the 
airline was "struggling to keep regional routes alive"in the face of low-cost rivals.
There are five major German-owned carriers now operating scheduled low-cost flights from the country - Air Berlin, 
DBA, Germania Express, Germanwings and Hapag-Lloyd Express. Some - such as DBA, the former British 
Airways-owned Deutsche BA - have reinvented themselves as LCCs under new owners. Others, like Germania and 
low cost The battle for Germany .
Germanwings, are all-new brands. Now, however, there are signs that the LCC travel market in Germany may be 
reaching overcapacity, a situation not helped by the country's continuing economic problems. Joachim Klein, 
managing director of Germanwings, which began operations in 2002, says the German market cannot support so 
many no-frills airlines in the long term. "No German low-cost carrier is earning money at the moment. There will be 
consolidation this year," he says.
DBA entered the low-cost market in March 2002, following EasyJet's decision to drop its g50 million ($62 million) 
takeover bid for the struggling airline, citing Lufthansa's strong competitive position and Germany's rigid labour 
laws. German investment company Intro stepped in, paying a token g1 for the company, which has a fleet of 16 
Boeing 737-300s. It used the threat of closure to force through steep cost cuts, and slim the airline back to a 
domestic carrier - although it has since reopened routes to Malaga in Spain and Nice in southern France. Being a 
BA subsidiary had made DBA uncompetitive, says chief executive Martin Gauss. "BA's processes are different it 
uses expensive flight planning systems which we don't need just to plan flights from Munich to Berlin, for example." 
The carrier's main competitor will remain Lufthansa, says Gauss. "We definitely have lower costs, the same aircraft, 
the same level of service, and sometimes more frequencies, but we don't see passengers switching from Lufthansa 
to DBA," he says. However, high costs are no longer a serious problem. Gauss says:"We only need a 64.9% load 
factor to break even at our current yield other low-cost carriers need 70-85%." Although load factors are only 55%, 
he insists a planned advertising campaign will push the airline into profit by the end of the 2004/5 financial year.
Hapag-Lloyd Express was launched in December 2002 by German travel group TUI using 737-700s wet-leased 
from Berlin-based carrier Germania. Chief executive Wolfgang Kurth also sees Lufthansa as the main threat, and 
says it has recently become far more dangerous. "We used to choose routes that were already operated by full-
service carriers. But now the full-service carriers are reacting to us immediately. For example, when we started 
operating from Cologne to Hamburg, Lufthansa immediately dropped the fare from more than g200 to g92," he 
says. "This is below our cost level, so Lufthansa must be putting money into the route."
Joachim Klein, managing director of Germanwings, a subsidiary of part-Lufthansa owned regional carrier 
Eurowings, thinks that his airline's "German-ness" stands it in good stead against its foreign rivals. "The brand 
awareness ofEasyJet in Germany is quite low - about 20%." says Klein. "At the moment German low-cost carriers 
have better awareness and loyalty in our own regions."
Klein believes the new LCCs are their own biggest competitors. "When we started looking at the low-cost market 
we thought we would be the only one," he says. "But a lot of others have come into the market after us. We are one 
of four main players - Germanwings, Germania Express, Hapag-Lloyd Express and Air Berlin." He says DBA, which 
has chosen a higher-price strategy aimed at business travellers, "is not direct competition". EasyJet, however, has 
proved a thorn in Germanwings' side.
The UK airline operates a dedicated terminal at Schonefeld, decked out in its distinctive orange colours. Six aircraft 
are based there and, by the end of June, it will operate 13 routes. It has a second mini-hub in Dortmund, with three 
aircraft serving six European cities, with Budapest and Prague to be added shortly. "We had intended to start a hub 
at Berlin Schonefeld, but now we are thinking it over. Because of EasyJet it makes no sense at the moment," says 
Klein.
As in the UK, the low-cost market in Germany appears to be dividing into two distinct customer segments. On the 
one hand, cost-conscious business travellers, happy or compelled by their companies' budgets to exchange frills for 
cheaper flights on the other, leisure travellers visiting family, taking short city or ski breaks or travelling to second 
homes in the sun. This second segment has taken share from the full-service carriers, the charter operators (with 
people keen to "unbundle" or arrange their own holidays) and trains, and include many passengers who - were it 
not for the low-cost carriers - would not fly at all. DBA and EasyJet have focused largely on the first group, with 
DBA's Gauss claiming the airline's strength at Germany's slot-restricted airports gives it an advantage. "We have 
high frequencies at peak times," he says. For business travellers "frequency is key, and EasyJet couldn't get near 
our frequencies". At the other extreme, Germanwings says up to 30% of its passengers last year would otherwise 
have used ground transport.
low cost The battle for Germany .
All the low-cost operators seem to agree that the German market alone cannot sustain them. While EasyJet and 
Ryanair have pursued aggressive expansion strategies, by establishing hubs in Germany, France, Switzerland and 
Belgium among others, most of the German LCCs appear to be banking on deals with existing LCCs abroad. Three 
have done so:Air Berlin with Niki in Austria Germanwings with Bmibaby in the UK and Hapag-Lloyd Express with 
Volareweb in Italy. Germanwings' Klein says the operator is looking for relationships with the Star Alliance partners 
of its part-owner Lufthansa, but this is proving tricky.
"We are limited, because Bmibaby and [SASlow-fare operation] Snowflake are the only European low-cost carriers 
in the Star Alliance. We are talking to Snowflake, and we are also talking about co-operation with LOTPolish 
Airlines - but these are in the early stages. The first phase of any agreement will be marketing, then we will see how 
we can work together. EasyJet and Ryanair have such large networks that they have enough market power on their 
own, and don't need alliances,"Klein says. Germanwings does, however, plan to make use of its links with 
Lufthansa. "It's possible to share slots between the members of our Lufthansa family," says Klein, adding that 
Germanwings could also grow by taking over routes from its parent Eurowings: "We are discussing taking routes 
from Eurowings...but this will be the last thing we do: first we want to develop new routes."
Air Berlin signed an agreement in February with Germania under which it wet-leases three Fokker 100s and 
operates alone on routes where the carriers previously competed. "Working against each other makes no 
sense,"Germania chief executive HinrichBischoff said earlier this year. In January Germania also took a 24% stake 
in Niki - which Air Berlin is partnering with - and is co-operating on services to Majorca, where Air Berlin plans to set 
up a hub.
Hapag-Lloyd Express also has high hopes for its tie-up with Volareweb. "It is not about connecting networks - we 
are just taking advantage of their marketing organisation, and it works," says Kurth. "We are seriously looking at 
some other options to expand this could be co-operation on representatives, on booking, or on computers."
But, he adds:"Linking networks loses one of our key business attributes:point-to-point travel."Like Germanwings, 
Hapag-Lloyd Express can also rely on the support of a powerful parent. "TUIwill have Hapag-Lloyd Express as its 
preferred carrier," says Kurth. "We are one of the only low-costcarriers with links with travel agents, and we have a 
hugedistribution network through our parent company."
However, a shake-up appears inevitable. "By the end of it," says Germanwings' Klein, "There will be three German 
low-cost carriers in Germany, plus EasyJet, all much stronger than in the past."Copyright 2004 Reed Business

Ryanair profits fell for the financial year to March 31, 2004 with the Irish low-cost carrier blaming higher fuel costs 
and the expense of expanding its fleet and route network. For the first time since its flotation in 1997, the airline 
made a net loss in the fourth quarter of the year, and full-year net profits were down to (EURO)227 million ($275

capacity was, at (EURO)13.3 million, more than double Ryanair's original estimate of (EURO)5 million, but, says the 
airline, there are no more early retirements to come.l Air India plans to launch a low-cost subsidiary to compete for 
the expatriate worker market. The state-owned flag carrier airline, provisionally named Air India Express, is planned 
to start flying in April 2005 using six leased 737-800s, growing to 10 by October and 14 by March 2006. Routes will 
be from Calicut, Chennai, Cochin, Delhi, Mumbai and Trivandrum to destinations in the Gulf states, the Middle East 
and South-East Asia.
The airline hopes to operate with fares 25% lower than Air India, but will face competition from recent Arab startups, 
such as Air Arabia, for the guest worker market. Air India plans to dry lease six 737-800s with CFM56 engines. All 
six are to be delivered in March 2005.l El Al, the Israeli flag carrier, moved a step closer to its likely merger with 
domestic and charter airline Arkia when it dropped out of government control for the first time in its 56-year history. 
The Israeli government's stake fell below 50% after Arkia parent company Knafaim-Arkia Holdings exercised 
options to increase its holding to 22%. The airline is to be privatized in stages: the government sold 15% of El Al 
outright last summer, and options for the remaining 85%, with varying exercise dates. All the options can be 
exercised by the end of this year, when the airline will become completely privately owned. Knafaim-Arkia holds 
enough options to give it 51.9% of El Al when the privatization is complete. In the meantime the Israeli government, 
still the single largest shareholder, will continue to make major strategic decisions such as aircraft purchases, but

will consult Knafaim-Arkia.l America West Airlines is to buy 22 A319s and A320s that will be used to help it grow in 
2005 and 2006. Five of the aircraft are will leased and the other 17 will be purchased directly from Airbus.
America West has renegotiated a previous order for 15 A318s. In exchange for increasing its order by seven 
aircraft, Airbus has given America West the option of converting its existing order into A319s or A320s or to cancel 
the order altogether under certain unspecified conditions. Having spent the past couple of years consolidating after 
its restructuring in 2002, America West is confident of its ability to grow as a low-cost airline. "Low costs are 
continuing to grow, and it is important for us to be one who is growing," says Derek Kerr, America West CFO. "We 
see 8% to 10% as a realistic target for the foreseeable future and we didn't have the aircraft positions to meet this 
demand." America West plans to use the aircraft to meet its 8% to 10% predicted growth in 2005 and 2006. It has 
already taken delivery of the four of the five leased aircraft, although they will not be in operation until 2005. CIT and 
ILFC will lease the aircraft to America West on operating leases. It intends to take the fifth when it is needed. The 
other 17 aircraft are to be purchased directly from Airbus in late 2005 and 2006. Kerr says the airline plans to raise 
funds either through the capital markets or through bank debt.l Boeing Capital has announced the sale of its 
commercial finance unit to GE Commercial Finance, saying that it intends to focus on financing for its own 
customers. 
"This further advances our strategic priority to support the sales of Boeing products and services by arranging, 
structuring or providing financing," says Walt Skowronski, president of Boeing Capital. The decision to move Boeing 
Capital away from its core business was part of ex-CEO Phil Condit's strategy to broaden Boeing's business. 
Boeing has already moved its headquarters to Chicago from its Seattle manufacturing base, and acquired defence 
contractor McDonnell Douglas and satellite manufacturer Hughes Space. Harry Stonecipher, Condit's successor, 
has reversed the trend. The transaction includes about $2 billion in assets and is expected to close by the end of 
June. Under the agreement, Boeing Capital will receive a premium above the net asset value at closing for the 
sale.l Frontier Airlines has reported a net income of $12.6 million for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. This 
compares with a net loss of $22.8 million the previous year. Passenger revenues were up by 33.7% for the year 
and operating costs were down from 8.33 cents per available seat-mile to 8.31 cents. 
While the full-year results look positive, the airline reported a net loss of $5.8 million for the fourth quarter. Although 
this is better than its 2003 fourth quarter loss of $13 million, high fuel costs and depressed fares have hit the airline. 
Despite the continued improvement in its operating costs and customer revenue, Frontier does not expect to turn a 
profit in the next quarter either. "Although our bookings are strong and we are seeing further reductions in our unit 
costs, excluding fuel, the fuel price increases we've just seen since the end of the March quarter, as well as a 
continued weak yield environment, have led us to believe that we will most likely report a loss on the upcoming 
June quarter," says Jeff Potter, Frontier president and CEO. The airline says that the chances of returning to 
profitability will depend on whether it can continue to compete with the market and find a way to combat high fuel 
prices.l Southwest Airlines has offered its employees a package of cash, healthcare and travel benefits in return for 
their resignations. 
The offer, which is open to all employees who have been with the airline for more than a year, is the airline's 
solution to reducing operating costs without resorting to layoffs. Although Southwest has been consistently 
profitable, including the last quarter, this move shows that it is still fighting costs hard. "This is our way of reducing 
operating costs without resorting to the dreaded layoffs," says a spokeswoman for Southwest. "We need to reduce 
the headcount and our overall operating costs, yet we're extremely loyal to our employees." Southwest says the 
offer came at the request of its employees, who wanted to forestall possible layoffs. Interest in these buyouts have 
occurred in the past for Southwest - in May a number of reservations staff accepted a similar offer, and there was 
another in 1988.l Thai Airways International has reported a net profit for the second quarter of the fiscal year 2004 
of Bt5.32 billion ($130 million), 11% up from last year. Revenue rose 7.2% to Bt39.9 billion, while operating costs 
rose only 4.7% to Bt30.7 billion. 
Average passenger load factor increased to 74% from 72.8%. Thai expects to meet a pretax profit target of Bt18.4 
billion for the full year, a 4% increase from last year. Thai posted a pretax profit of Bt17.7 billion in its 2003 financial 
year. Thai officials also say that the airline's study in its fleet requirements for the next 10 years will be concluded 
before the end of July. The study will determine the number of long-range mid-sized and large-sized aircraft the 
In Brief
airline will buy.l Singapore Airlines' (SIA) net profit for the year ended March 31, 2004 has fallen 20% to S$849 
million ($500 million). It made a first-quarter loss of S$312 million because of the Sars outbreak. Indeed, for the nine 
months between July 2003 to March 2004, the airline recorded a net profit of S$1.16 billion.
The earnings include positive contributions from the corporate tax cut rate due to take place in Singapore in the 
2005 tax year. This cut has allowed a write-back of S$205 million in previous years' deferred tax liabilities. The 
weaker Singapore dollar provided a net gain of S$268 million to the group's operating profit. SIA's passenger and 
capacity traffic were 12.8% and 11.4% lower, respectively, than the previous year because of the drop in demand 
for travel and a corresponding cutback in capacity during the Sars outbreak. l Hainan Airlines has received 
shareholder approval to buy 26 aircraft this year. It will purchase five 737-800s, seven other 737s (including 737-
300s, 737-400s and 737-700s), three 767-300ERs, five A319s and six Dornier 328s. The carrier has also 
announced a 56% growth in first-quarter earnings to Yuan 51.8 million ($6.3 million). l All Nippon Airways (ANA) is 
planning to set up a budget airline. The carrier will operate 737-700s, but a start date has not been announced. 
Market sources believe that the new airline will fly domestic Japanese routes rather than compete in the 
international market. Last year ANA placed an order worth up to $2.48 billion for 45 737-700 jets, some of which will 
be used by the low-cost start-up.l EasyJet, the low-cost operator, is the fastest-growing aviation brand in Britain. 
A survey, conducted by advertising firm Euro RSCG Worldwide, showed easyJet as the eighth fastest-growing 
brand overall. Top is eBay, the internet auction site, followed by internet search engine Google and mobile phone 
company Nokia. American Airlines, on the other hand, was fifth in the top 10 of brands with least momentum. British 
Airlines came seventh, with Boeing 10th.

Low-cost Irish airline Ryanair today said it carried 18.7pc more passengers in May this year compared with the 
same month last year.
The no-frills carrier said it had 2.17 million passengers in May, bringing the rolling 12-month total to 24.14m.
The company's load factor - the percentage of seats filled per flight - was 81pc, bringing the 12-month figure to 
81pc compared to a load factor of 77pc in May of last year.
 Internet sales in March totalled 97pc of all seats sold compared to 94pc last year. The airline this morning reported 
that, in the year to end-March 2004, the airline made a pretax profit of E228m, in line with analyst forecasts, which 
were slashed after a January profit warning but down from E265m in 2003. On the Dublin ISEQ stock market index 
at 12:30, Ryanair's shares were trading down 11c to 427 while on the London market the stock had declined by 6c 
to 428.

Fuel surcharges imposed
The early lead set by Continental Airlines, British Airways and Qantas in imposing a passenger fuel surcharge has 
so far been followed by Air New Zealand, KLM, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic. BAannounced in mid-May 
that it planned to charge an extra [pounds sterling]2.50 ($4.40) on each leg of a journey (see Market Outlook, page 
74).
However, in Europe, Ryanair and easyJet are resisting the move, arguing that the market will not sustain such a 
rise.
All Nippon launches 7E7
As predicted, All Nippon Airways has become the launch customer for the Boeing 7E7 mid-range cruiser with an 
order for an unspecified mixture of 50 short-range 7E7-3s and long-range 7E7-8s worth $5.7 billion at list prices. 
Deliveries are set for 2008, with an engine choice due in the third quarter.

EasyJet, the British airline, is aiming to replace check-in staff with automated kiosks in the latest cost-cutting drive 
in the no-frills airline industry.
EasyJet claimed an industry first last week with all 108 passengers on a flight from Nottingham East Midlands 
airport to Prague checking in using the self-service kiosks, including those with hold baggage.
Ray Webster, EasyJet chief executive, said: "In due course, this could revolutionise the airport process in the way 
that the internet revolutionised the booking process."
EasyJet said the system would be rolled out in other airports across its network which would "ultimately see kiosk-
only check-in".
Many other airlines offer self-service check-in but only as an alternative to staffed desks. EasyJet said that "keeping 
two channels open is an unnecessary duplication and increases, rather than decreases, costs."
EasyJet has already reduced the number of toilets on its new Boeing aircraft from three to two in order to squeeze 
in extra passengers.
It argued that, because there was no free drink and food on board, fewer toilets were needed.
The pressure to drive down costs will be underlined tomorrow when budget airline Ryanair reports its full-year 
results, expected to show a 10 per cent fall in net profits before exceptional items to Euros 215m (Pounds 143m).
The airline shocked investors in January by issuing its first profits warning since flotation in 1997, triggering a 31 per 
cent one-day fall in its share price.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, has warned of a looming shake-out in the low-cost sector with many of 
the recent start-up airlines suffering heavy losses.

* Ryanair, the worst performer in the FTSE Eurotop 300 index so far this year, will disclose how far its profits fell in 
the 12 months to the end of March. The rot set in at the end of January, when Europe's leading low-cost airline 
shocked investors by issuing its first profit warning since flotation in 1997, triggering a 31 per cent one-day fall in its 
share price. It has since declined further, trading at a 12- month low of Euros 4.34 last Friday against a peak of 
Euros 7.59 in late January. Michael O'Leary, chief executive, who is still battling the European Commission about 
alleged illegal state aid, has warned of a 10 per cent fall in net profits before exceptional items to about Euros 215m 
(Pounds 144m). Analysts have forecast a small quarterly loss, the first since flotation, or break-even for the final 
three months.
WEDNESDAY
* Investors will belooking for an update on Cable and Wireless's UK strategy when the group releases its annual 
results. With little evidence of growth in the UK market, some analysts believe that further cost-cutting is needed to 
take its UK division to profitability. For the year to the end of March, analysts expect the group to deliver profits 
before tax of Pounds 270m on group-wide revenues of Pounds 3.6bn. Earnings per share are expected to be 4p.
THURSDAY
* Daily Mail & General Trust, the newspaper publishing group controlled by the Rothermere family, will reveal 
financial results for the first six months of the year. The company, which has been touted as a possible buyer of 
Hollinger International's Telegraph group, is expected to report adjusted pre-tax profits of about Pounds 80m. The 
company held off on announcing a turn in the advertising market in March, when it said trading conditions at its 
regional division were ahead of last year's figures but warned that advertising sales at its national division were still 
volatile.
FRIDAY
* Hornby is expected to report pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 5.4m) for the year to March, after 
enjoying a good Christmas when sales were boosted by the launch of a train set featuring a steam-powered engine.

The airline long described by its backers as the most successful carrier never to have flown finally left the tarmac 
last week. Filled with celebrities and VIPs, Jetstar's inaugural flight took off at 6am last Tuesday and flew from 
Newcastle, the former steel town north of Sydney, to Melbourne.
Qantas, Australia's dominant carrier, is trying to do with Jetstar what no incumbent airline has achieved: set up a 
discount carrier with which its mainline operation can successfully co-exist in the long term.
"We know most legacy airlines haven't been able to do it but we happen to believe you can," says Geoff Dixon, 
chief executive of Qantas. "We felt strongly there was room opening up for another low-cost carrier in Australia."
The fledgling airline is being launched at a difficult time for the low-cost segment. The price of jet fuel, which 
typically accounts for 12 to 16 per cent of an airline's expenses, has soared. Along with other airlines, Qantas this 
month announced a surcharge on ticket prices to ease its cost burden.
Europe hosts some 50 low-cost carriers, but margins at EasyJet and Ryanair have been driven down by intense 
competition as newer entrants such as Flying Finn and Duo have gone to the wall.
While British Airways, Qantas's partner and largest shareholder, sold Go, its low-cost carrier, three years ago in 
part because it had become a management distraction, Mr Dixon says Jetstar is a "management necessity" for the 
Australian group.
Qantas has invested ADollars 100m (Pounds 39m) in the new carrier. Headed by Alan Joyce, a 38-year-old former 
Ryanair executive, it is set to fill several strategic holes.
First, it is Qantas's answer to Virgin Blue, the discount carrier set up by Sir Richard Branson in 2000 with seed 
capital of just ADollars 11m. Virgin Blue has since gobbled up a third of the domestic market.
High stakes for a low-cost debut: AIRLINES: With Jetstar, Qantas is attempting a risky manoeuvre: creating a 
no-frills sibling of a mainline carrier, writesVirg....
Second, it is an important element in the group's growth strategy. The leisure segment of Australian air travel is 
expanding. The emergence of low-cost carriers around the world has stimulated the market and Virgin Blue was no 
exception. Mr Thomas says the Australian aviation sector is expected to grow at an annual rate of up to 15 per cent 
over the next two years, with the leisure segment accounting for 60 to 65 per cent of the market.
Qantas itself has bucked the global downturn in aviation with a bold expansion strategy that has seen its revenues 
climb from ADollars 9bn in 1999-2000 to ADollars 11.4bn in the year to last June while maintaining profitability. It 
hopes the discount airline will help it sustain this performance.
Jetstar is also expected to help lower the group's overall costs in the longer term as some of its productivity 
initiatives migrate to the mainline service.
Finally, by entering the market at this stage, Qantas is likely to deter other new entrants and help prevent a vicious, 
European-style price war, say analysts.
The new airline's timing has been dictated largely by the rapid rise in Virgin Blue's market share - at 33 per cent, 
this is approaching danger point for Qantas. "About 65 per cent is the market share Qantas needs to be profitable," 
Mr Dixon says. "We have drawn a line in the sand and intend to defend it."
As a relative latecomer to the low-cost segment, Qantas has the advantage of seeing where others have gone 
wrong, from BA with Go to Air Canada with Tango.
"British Airways gave Go a very free rein," says Ian Thomas, a director at the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation in 
Sydney, adding that the low-cost carrier was allowed to compete head-on with its parent. "Qantas is not going to do 
that. With Jetstar, it is filling a niche in the market."
Mr Dixon says there were two main criteria when planning Jetstar. First, the new carrier had to work constructively 
within the group as a whole. While Jetstar will compete with the mainline carrier on some routes, it has also been 
allocated some of its own, mainly on leisure routes in Queensland and Tasmania.
"We're saying 'you run yourself as Jetstar but you run yourself as part of the Qantas group'," Mr Dixon says. "The 
bottom line on this is what are the profits of the Qantas group, not what are the profits of Qantas mainline or 
Jetstar."
The second criterion was that the carrier should be truly low-cost - a point on which other legacy airlines have 
compromised, analysts say. "We have a cost structure that is genuinely not polluted by any of the mainline airline's 
costs," says Mr Dixon.
To achieve this, Jetstar has introduced features that, though familiar to existing discount airlines, are new to the 
local market. It has free- choice seating - passengers sit where they choose - and, in a country where it is usually 
possible to turn up 20 minutes before take-off and still travel, check-in will close 30 minutes before departure, 
further cutting costs.
In a move resisted by many within Qantas, the group decided against connecting Jetstar flights with those of the 
mainline service - passengers will have to collect their bags and check in again when travelling with both airlines. 
Mr Dixon says this will save a hefty ADollars 50m a year.
Jetstar is also pioneering the use of a secondary airport in Australia, a strategy successfully employed by low-cost 
start-ups in Europe. For a third of its flights in and out of Melbourne, it is using Avalon, an airfield about 35 miles 
from the city centre, rather than the main hub at Tullamarine, 15 miles from the city.
Such measures mean that the carrier's cost per available seat kilometre (ASK) - a standard measure in the industry 
- is put at an initial 8.25 cents, though this will drop to about 7.8 cents in time once its more efficient fleet of 23 
Airbus A320s replaces its current fleet of Boeing 717s. This compares with 7.73 cents per ASK at Virgin Blue.
High stakes for a low-cost debut: AIRLINES: With Jetstar, Qantas is attempting a risky manoeuvre: creating a 
no-frills sibling of a mainline carrier, writesVirg....
While Qantas is to an extent quarantining its mainline operations by giving Jetstar exclusive routes and skewing its 
timetable to off-peak travel, analysts say the airline expects its offspring to steal business from the mainline carrier 
as well as from Virgin Blue.
With Jetstar, Qantas will make higher margins on some routes than with its heavily unionised mainline service 
because its costs are about 45 per cent lower.
"Jetstar is going to be a parasite to Qantas itself. That is one of its philosophies. They don't mind cannibalising 
themselves. It's a smart way of beating the unions," says Hugh Ritchie, a senior lecturer in aviation management at 
Griffith University in Brisbane. "The travelling public have moved away from brand loyalty to economic satisfaction."
Despite the poor precedents for legacy carriers in the discount segment globally and for new entrants in Australia's 
domestic market, analysts are relatively positive about Jetstar's prospects.
Citigroup Smith Barney predicts the new carrier will contribute ADollars 70m to group pre-tax profits in its first year, 
rising to ADollars 130m in the following year. It believes it will achieve a market share of 25 per cent by 2007.
Few predict another price war like the one that broke out after Virgin Blue's launch in 2000. "We expect both 
Qantas/Jetstar and Virgin Blue to compete rationally in what should ultimately become a cosy duopoly," says Jason 
Mabee, aviation analyst at ABN Amro in Sydney.
Back in 2000-01, there were four carriers competing on the main trunk routes, two of which subsequently folded or 
were taken over. In addition, Virgin Blue has now become a public company with a commitment to increase its 
profits, having listed on the Australian Stock Exchange late last year.
"(The doubters) tend not to have taken into account that no two markets are the same," says Mr Dixon. "We do 
believe you must grow. What we don't want to be doing is sitting here and saying we are a legacy airline, just taking 
out costs and running a traditional business."

When the Belgian authorities asked Michael O'Leary to repay Euros 3m of subsidies which had been ruled illegal, 
Ryanair's chief executive wrote back to say "fuck off". That puts the Belgian authorities in a not very exclusive club. 
Rival airlines, customers, wheelchair users - all have received the same message. In fact, you're nobody if the 
combative Irishman hasn't told you the same thing.
This may be all very well for a pub landlord, striving to build a reputation as a "character". But it has worn thin on a 
chief executive whose business is expected on Tuesday to report more than Euros 1bn of revenues in the year to 
March - and a fall into net loss for the March quarter, to boot.
Nor is it necessary. The budget airlines have often been piloted by colourful characters with a rebellious streak, 
such as Southwest Airlines' Herb Kelleher. Southwest, however, has for the last 13 years topped the US 
Department of Transportation tables for customer satisfaction, with just 0.14 complaints per 100,000 emplanements 
in 2003. Ryanair records 68 complaints per 100,000 passengers. But then, as Southwest president Colleen Barrett 
once said: "We use the word 'love' a lot at Southwest." Perhaps Mr O'Leary, too, might try a different kind of four-
letter word.

British cuisine has a lot to be proud of at the moment but, occasionally, it ought to be ashamed of itself: for many it 
is now just too expensive to eat out in the UK. This is especially the case in London, where you are lucky to get 
more than a couple of mints back from Pounds 100 on a dinner for two. And once you've shelled out for pre-dinner 
drinks, taxis and maybe a spot of dancing then, frankly, you have spent so much that you may as well have gone 
abroad for the weekend.
This is precisely the mentality that spawned the Flying Gourmet - why spend all your hard-earned cash on an 
expensive hangover in this country, when you can spend the same (or slightly more) on 48 hours eating in another?
Thanks to Ryanair, Easyjet and the like, Europe's top foodie destinations are now only pennies away and Flying 
Gourmets (FGs) are masters at winkling out the very cheapest airline deals - freeing up the rest of their cash for 
flavoured oils, spicy salamis and sugary delicacies. A true FG works his or her way nimbly around the back-pages 
of the internet and is ready to pounce when an airline posts one of its "latest deal" e-mails.
FG and film producer Oliver Wrigley, 31, explains: "If I hear that Ryanair is offering a period of free flights, it's like a 
red rag to a bull. Within seconds I'm avidly surfing the site to try and match the deal to a place that I know is 
renowned for good food." Wrigley admits that when he finds a golden ticket, he books there and then, even if 
there's a chance he won't be able to use it. "It's only a question of Pounds 20. But, once I've booked I usually do 
end up going - it's something to look forward to a few weeks along the line.
"I'm always keeping my eyes peeled for deals for certain places which I know have Michelin-starred restaurants, or 
recommended places tucked away off the map."
Once the tickets are booked, meticulous planning takes over. Every meal must be accounted for - no culinary 
resource is overlooked. Books, websites, newspaper travel pages - all are scanned or photocopied, and any 
colleagues or friends who have been to the chosen destination is given a thorough grilling. The eating out section of 
the phrasebook is studied, and tables are reserved.
Secrets of a flying gourmet Off-season prices plus in-season food is the perfect combination for a memorable 
trip, says Rebecca Rose
There are two phrases that particularly excite the Flying Gourmet. The first is "off-season". In the greyer months of 
the year, accommodation is cheaper, restaurants are emptier, and, as most of the time will be spent indoors 
lingering over the menu gourmande anyway, bad weather doesn't matter. Except that between each meal the FG 
will be marching around the city in a determined fashion - working off lunch in time for dinner.
Unworried by the weather, the FG should also be relaxed about the damage a weekend's troughing can do to one's 
girth. Contrary to what one might expect, Oliver Wrigley asserts: "I actually lose weight when I go on these breaks. 
You are just generally much more active than you would be at home. You may be eating a hearty breakfast, lunch 
and dinner - with ice-creams in between - but the rest of the time you are on the go."
The other key phrase is "in season". "There's nothing better than working out when to be somewhere for when wild 
mushrooms are at their best, or when seafood is abundant," Wrigley says excitedly.
Another FG hallmark is a willingness to try destinations that may not, on first consideration, sound like obvious 
foodie meccas. Brussels, yes; Genoa, of course. But Amsterdam? Graz? Dublin? The true FG will already be 
armed with insider foodie knowledge to make the most of even the most unlikely gourmet destination.
So how best to travel? Despite the glamorous ring of a "gastrobreak", there is little room for any sartorial elegance. 
The hand luggage-sized wheelie suitcase must leave the UK nearly empty, as it is to return bulging with local 
produce. Loading up on foreign foodstuffs is an essential element of such trips and acts as a small compensation 
for returning home. It is also an opportunity to make a saving on the equivalent costs in the UK - appealing to the 
penny-pinching nature of the FG. But as a result, FGs are known to get carried away. A typical haul might include 
wine, oils, cheese and any salami/meat products that are likely to make it through customs plus teas, coffees, 
liquors, chocolate, cakes and kitchen hardware (Gaggia coffeemakers, Parmesan graters, Le Creuset casseroles, 
novelty oven gloves, olive presses).
So the next time you open the overhead locker on a cheap flight from Europe and are met with an agreeable waft of 
continental cheese or poked in the eye by a crisp baguette, you will know straight away that you are in the presence 
of a flying gourmet.

Sir, Michael O'Leary has the right idea in his two-word comment to the European Commission ("Ryanair refuses to 
repay Euros 3m state aid", May 26). 
Bringing air passengers, investment and prosperity to destinations that would otherwise be underused can only be 
good for local businesses. I have not heard Charleroi complain at the agreement, only overpriced monopolising 
airlines.
It is just a shame Mr O'Leary is not British: at times we too could do with offering a few choice words to the 
bureaucrats that make senseless regressive rulings.
Richard Bailey, Business Development Manager, Dataton UK Ltd, Woking, Surrey GU21 5JY
From Mr Peter Goodall.
Sir, You quote Michael O'Leary (May 26) as saying "We have written back (to the Belgian authorities) to say 'fuck 
off' ". A lot of people probably think he is a straight-talking, in-your-face, competition-promoting role model for 
modern chief executives.
On the other hand, I hope a lot of people think he is just foul-mouthed and wonder whether he has chosen the right 
way to deal with the authorities concerned.

Sir, The vulgarity of Michael O'Leary that you reported ("Ryanair refuses to repay Euros 3m state aid", May 26) 
reminds me of Ken Dodd's diddy man, who would threaten to "marmalise" anyone who crossed his path.
While one might raise an amused eyebrow at his profanity and pugnacious pluck, the newsworthy element of the 
story is the sad fact that he has still not learnt the first lesson of communication. Did his mother never teach him to 
say the magic words "please" and "thank you"?
Government servants are decent people who respond better to common courtesy than abuse. I, for one, shall not 
hold my breath to wait for the next chapter in this classic cautionary saga.
It does not require genius to work out that when a bad-tempered child screams and curses, the result is discipline.

Ryanair is refusing to pay back alleged state subsidies arising from the low-cost carrier's operations at Belgium's 
Charleroi airport.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the Belgian authorities had written to the airline demanding the 
repayment of about Euros 3m (Pounds 2m).
"We have written back to say 'fuck off'," he said yesterday.
He said Ryanair had incurred costs eight times higher in setting up its base at Charleroi and that the airline had the 
right to offset these costs against the alleged subsidies.
Ryanair yesterday formally launched its appeal against the decision of the European Commission, announced in 
February, that various benefits it had received at Charleroi, south of Brussels, constituted illegal state aid.
Ryanair said it was asking the European Court of First Instance to annul the Commission's "flawed decision".
Under the state aid rules, a public airport must be able to compete on a level playing-field with private airports and 
offer the same conditions, said the airline. Charleroi airport, which became Ryanair's first base in continental 
Europe in April 2001, is owned by the regional government of Wallonia.
The airline claimed that the Commission had "completely ignored" the fact that the airline had lower cost deals at 
some private airports.
In addition, the group claimed that the Commission had ignored the fact that the deal was "specifically offered to 
other airlines willing to make the same investment in the airport as Ryanair".
Ryanair said last month it had struck a new deal with Charleroi, which would leave net charges on existing routes 
from the airport at the same level that first triggered the state aid investigation by the Commission more than two 
years ago.

Hand luggage is an important part of the business traveller's kit. Not only does it offer a safety net of spare clothing 
in case your main luggage goes astray but it allows you to work during a flight and protects valuables from the 
uncertainty of the hold.
Not all airlines are alike when it comes to the amount of carry-on baggage allowed. There are no industry guidelines 
or legislation, although the International Transport Workers Federation has called for a single, universal upper limit 
of carry-on baggage to prevent competitive pressure forcing the allowance higher.
It estimated that there are 20,000 passenger and employee injuries worldwide each year attributable to carry-on 
baggage. However, the Civil Aviation Authority simply recommends that luggage should fit in "the allocated space", 
which usually means overhead lockers.
Baggage allowances are set by each airline, and come with caveats. Airlines generally reserve the right to change 
the allowance. They can insist that a particular item is checked-in if it is too heavy or the wrong shape.
Watch out if luggage you had intended to take on board ends up in the hold. Thefts do occur, and it is best to 
remove any valuables, such as jewellery or expensive cameras, from checked luggage. Airline compensation is 
limited and travel insurance often restricts pay-outs to thefts from the person. It is also common to forget to remove 
travel documents such as passports.
You may also find you are charged excess baggage fees if you inadvertently breach the rules - the most commonly 
used guideline is 1.5 per cent of the full one-way economy fare for each additional kilo, according to the Air 
Transport Users Council.
It is up to the passenger to ensure luggage fits the carrier's requirements, and most airline websites list baggage 
regulations. You may also find allowances printed on your ticket, but be careful if you are taking a series of flights

But it's no laughing matter to travellers, says Clare G....
using different operators; there may be different policies. The good news for business and first-class travellers is 
that these seats are generally given a more generous allowance than economy.
Allowable hand baggage is usually described in two ways: weight and dimension. Smaller airlines, such as Ryanair 
or Alitalia, allow only one piece of hand baggage weighing not more than 7kg or 6kg respectively. Dimensions must 
be less than 50cm by 35cm by 23cm for Ryanair, and 55cm by 20cm by 40cm for Alitalia.
Dimensions are sometimes given as linear measurements, which is simply the sum of the length, width and height; 
so Ryanair's would be 108cm, and Alitalia's 115cm.
Larger airlines, operating longer flights, bump up the weight, but not necessarily the dimensions, usually allowing 
business and first- class passengers two pieces of hand luggage, one of which may be a garment bag or briefcase. 
Watch out for wheels, side pockets and handles, which are included in most dimensions.
In addition, you are generally allowed one further piece of personal luggage, such as a laptop or handbag, 
overcoat, and necessary equipment such as walking sticks, crutches or collapsible wheelchairs. Some, such as 
Emirates, also specify "reasonable quantities" of duty-free liquor, cigarettes and perfume.
If you are travelling with children, collapsible pushchairs may also be allowed. Children have their own baggage 
allowance, so you will usually have room to bring a second bag with food or toys.
Finally, beware luggage sold as "hand baggage". It may be suitable, but there are no guarantees - and carrying it 
will be at the airline's discretion.

Air France has become the latest airline to levy a fuel surcharge on its passengers, adding an extra [euro]3 ($3.60) 
for each leg of a journey since 19 May, and will continue to do so until the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil has 
remained at $30 or less for 30 days.
Air France hopes that the charge will offset rising fuel costs and allow the airline to reach its objective of cutting 
[euro]200 million in costs in the 2004-5 fiscal year, [euro]400 million the following year and [euro]600 million in 
2006-7.
Air France is one of many major carriers that have added fuel tariffs this month as crude oil reached record highs of 
over $41 a barrel. British Airways, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, KLM, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, United 
Airlines and Virgin Atlantic Airways have all announced fare increases of between $3 and $20. Among the low-cost 
carriers, Southwest says it is considering a surcharge, but JetBlue and Ryanair have ruled out the possibility. 
EasyJet, which took heavy losses from higher fuel costs, is now starting to hedge fuel purchasing for the first time.
Jet fuel is now more costly than at any time since the end of the Iraq war, and many carriers, including United, 
blame fuel costs for their continuing losses. United chief executive Glenn Tilton says: "If not for fuel prices, I'd be 
able to say we'd be profitable this quarter."
Meanwhile, Air France, despite the effects of the war in Iraq, SARS in Asia and an air traffic controllers' strike in 
France in 2003 that cost the airline about [euro]60 million, posted a net profit of [euro]93 million for the year to 31 
March 2004, although this was 22.5% down on [euro]120 million in 2002-3.
The Air France results announced last week were its last. Next year's results will be those of the new Air France-
KLM group, which is aiming for "strong profits" and an operating profit of [euro]250 million, assuming the average 
price of fuel over the year is under $33 a barrel.

From Mr Trevor Pateman.
Sir, Samuel Brittan wants to give housing prices a shock (Comment, May 21). But why does he want to do this 
through interest rate rises? Has this ever yielded more than temporary disruption? Why not tackle the underlying 
problem, that the supply of new accommodation has not been allowed to keep up with household formation - thanks 
to restrictive practices maintained by government, colluded in by builders, and smugly endorsed by middle England.
If people were hungry but governments stopped farmers growing or selling food we would be outraged. If farmers 
declined to use combine harvesters, insisting on hand threshing, we should also be outraged. And if middle 
England's response was "let them eat cake", it would be "Off with their heads!"
We have seen what the opening up of markets can do - and quickly - in the airline industry. John Prescott, the 
deputy prime minister, should invite Michael O'Leary of Ryanair and Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of EasyJet, to try 
their hands at low-cost housing.
Trevor Pateman, Red Skies Consulting, Brighton BN1 2NW
From Mr Ronald Eyres.
Sir, As a reader who recalls Samuel Brittan's prophetic warning during the Barber boom ("The boom that must go 
bust") in the early 1970s, one welcomes his comment that "It is time to give house prices a shock" (May 21).
It is certainly no part of the Bank of England's remit or that of its monetary policy committee to act as patron saint to 
borrowers, especially the new breed of buy-to-let investors, whom the property website Rightmove blames for 
sending the market into overdrive.
A rise in interest rates to 5 to 5 1/2 per cent would prevent property speculation overextending itself and end a 
period of savers effectively subsidising borrowers.

Jozsef Varadi does nottake issue with the warnings about the looming shake-out in Europe's overcrowded low-cost 
airline industry. But he still thinks there is room for one more start-up - his own, Wizz Air.
The former chief executive of Malev, Hungary's state-owned flag carrier, says that in 5 to 10 years there will only be 
three to five viable European low-cost carriers, from a cast of more than 50 today. Two have already qualified: 
Ryanair and EasyJet.
He believes that Wizz Air too can be a survivor, however, because it will be the first no-frills operator set up 
specifically to exploit the new market that has opened up in central and east Europe through the enlargement this 
month of the EU. And it is planning a rigorous implementation of the tried-and-tested low-cost airline business 
model.
Only 19 days after the entry of 10 new members into the EU, the first Wizz Air services were launched this week 
from Katowice in south-east Poland to London Luton, Milan Bergamo and Rome Ciampino.
Mr Varadi is in a hurry. He believes that, if Wizz Air is to have a chance to succeed, it must expand quickly to gain a 
critical mass in the region, before the inevitable arrival of Ryanair and EasyJet.
"We have to own central and east Europe as our natural home market and make them like Dublin and Stansted are 
to Ryanair or Luton to EasyJet," he says.
By the beginning of July the Katowice base - with a catchment of 20m people - will have added six more routes to 
Paris Beauvais, Stockholm Skavsta, Barcelona Gerona - all secondary airports pioneered by Ryanair - as well as 
Athens, Budapest and Dortmund.
In late June it will open its second base in the region in Budapest, its headquarters city, and within four weeks will 
have opened six routes to London, Paris, Rome, Barcelona, Athens and Prague.
East is east and west is where they want to fly to: Kevin Done on the ambitious new low-cost airline designed to 
exploit EU enlargement
From the one aircraft flying this week it will have a fleet of six 180-seat Airbus A320s in operation by the end of July, 
one of the most ambitious start-up schedules ever attempted.
Mr Varadi believes Wizz Air can grow to a fleet of 30 or so aircraft within three years, adding about 10 a year. With 
20 aircraft and 10m offered seats it would become the largest operator in the region in 2005.
One of the keys to success will be deep pockets and Mr Varadi is hopeful that financial backing will be assured by 
the end of July.
Wizz Air has brought in more than Euros 6m (Dollars 7.2m) of equity capital from about 20 private investors, but 
within weeks hopes to have signed up private equity fund support totalling Euros 40m.
This week it agreed terms with Indigo Partners, a US private equity fund, to invest Euros 20m, and Mr Varadi is 
confident he is close to gaining a further Euros 20m from European funds.
Indigo, led by its managing partner Bill Franke, a former chief executive of America West Airlines, has emerged as 
a leading investor in Tiger Airways, an Asian low-cost start-up due to start flying from Singapore in September.
"Investing in airlines at best is a pretty risky business," said Mr Franke yesterday. "We made a pretty careful scrub 
of the (Wizz Air) business plan, the management team and the location, and felt this was a unique opportunity."
Wizz Air has brought on board Debis AirFinance, Europe's leading aircraft lessor, to provide its first six aircraft. 
Lufthansa Technik will provide maintenance, repair and overhaul services, with the reservations system supplied by 
Navitaire of the US, which includes Ryanair, Virgin Blue and JetBlue among its customers.
Mr Varadi claims that Wizz Air has already sold 40,000 tickets in a few weeks. "Once you break the price barrier, 
people are going to fly and will give up their present form of transport, which is mainly bus at the moment."
Wizz Air says there are 3,000 coach seats a week just from the Katowice region of south-west Silesia to London, 
with about 18 coaches a day. "If you look at the travel experience it takes about 24 hours with the bus or two hours 
to fly. The return coach fare is Euros 80 and we are selling at an average of Euros 100 return. Many of the 
passengers on our flights are first-time flyers.
"Today only 3-4 per cent of people travel by plane in central and east Europe, compared with 35-40 per cent in the 
UK. It is not just about buying power but also access to services."

BAA brushes off "unfair advantage" charge

BAA, the airports group, is forecasting "robust" passenger traffic growth at its UK airports.
Mike Clasper, chief executive, predicted volumes would rise by more than 6 per cent despite the uncertain 
international political outlook.
The growth would be supported by strengthening economies in the UK, North America and Asia.
Passenger volumes in the year to the end of March rose 4.4 per cent to 133.4m. BAA said its operating profit for the 
period had risen 4.9 per cent to Pounds 616m on turnover up 4.7 per cent at Pounds 1.97bn. Pre-tax profit was 
virtually unchanged at Pounds 539m.
The group is raising its full-year dividend 5.3 per cent to 20p. Of BAA's three regulated London airports, Heathrow 
lifted operating profit 7.1 per cent to Pounds 364m while operating profit fell 2.2 per cent at Gatwick to Pounds 91m 
and 9.3 per cent at Stansted to Pounds 39m.
Heathrow accounts for 48 per cent of BAA's UK traffic and for 63 per cent of its UK airports' operating profit. The 
growth in profits and revenues at Heathrow last year was driven in particular by increased airport charges and 
stronger retail sales.
Mr Clasper rejected force fully proposals put forward by BMI British Midland, the second-largest Heathrow operator 
after British Airways, for differential charging at the airport to reflect different standards of facilities.
Sir Michael Bishop, BMI chairman, has said British Airways will gain an unfair advantage when it moves into 
Terminal Five in 2008. Landing charges at Heathrow are set to rise by more than 40 per cent between 2003 and 
2008 to finance the Pounds 4.2bn project and the increase, set by the Civil Aviation Authority, the economic 
regulator for the three London airports, has been bitterly criticised by Heath row airlines led by BA, BMI and Virgin 
Atlantic.
Mr Clasper said BAA was also investing Pounds 3bn at Heath row over the next 10 years on non-T5 projects, 
including the development of the central area terminals that were expected to be used by BMI and the Star alliance.
BAA brushes off "unfair advantage" charge
BAA group capital expenditure jumped from Pounds 774m to Pounds 1.3bn last year under the impact of the T5 
project. BAA is expected to face a similar battle with the lowcost carriers Ryanair and EasyJet over increasing 
landing charges at Stansted, where it is in the early stage of planning a second runway and a second terminal in a 
project estimated to cost Pounds 2bn to take capacity initially from 35m to 50m passengers a year.
The first low-cost longhaul flight out of Stansted, to Vancouver, is to be launched by Zoom Airlines, of Canada, at 
the end of the is month.

A gang of professional armed robbers was foiled in an attempt to commit one of Britain's biggest thefts yesterday 
when it tried to steal gold bullion worth more than Pounds 40m and cash totalling Pounds 30m to Pounds 40m from 
a warehouse at Heathrow Airport.
Seven men were captured after armed police pulled off a potentially risky reverse-sting operation by laying in wait 
and capturing the men after they had begun the raid.
A white van rammed through the doors of the Swissport cargo warehouse on the airport's outskirts at about 10am 
and gang members leapt out to threaten staff with at least one gun and knives and cudgels.
They had planned to force their way into a secure area containing the gold shipment and a "substantial" amount of 
banknotes.
But as the van reversed through the warehouse shutters, more than 100 officers from the Metropolitan Police's 
Flying Squad and the SO19 armed response team, who had received a tip-off and had been tracking the thieves for 
weeks, were waiting to ambush the gang.
The police disabled the van with Hatton rounds - bullets designed to deflate tyres with minimal surrounding damage 
- and arrested six men in their 30s.
In an attempt to escape, two other suspects hijacked another white van and forced the driver to take them out of the 
warehouse. The van driver was unhurt and one of the men was later captured by police while driving another 
hijacked vehicle. The other was still being sought yesterday. The suspects were taken to west London police 
stations for questioning.
None of the warehouse staff were injured in the police operation, codenamed "Cartwright", but one officer sustained 
minor injuries.
Police thwart gang in Pounds 70m Heathrow raid ARMED ROBBERY:
Detective Superintendent Barry Phillips, from the Flying Squad, said: "In preventing this attack, we have foiled what 
would have been one of the biggest robberies ever committed in the UK. We believe that these men were part of an 
organised criminal enterprise."
The gang was believed to be operating with inside information of the gold shipment and cash, which arrived at the 
warehouse earlier in the day.
Swissport, the cargo handling company which is majority owned by Candover, the buyout specialists, said the van 
had been stopped at the warehouse entrance by security staff, who had not been warned of the expected raid. 
However, the gang had legitimate papers to go in and collect a consignment, it added.
The company said: "Some members of higher management were aware this raid was going to take place but for 
operational reasons this information was not shared with the rest of the workforce." Counselling had been arranged 
for some members of staff who were upset and shocked, he added.
Swissport handles more than 3m tonnes of cargo a year for customers including British Airways, First Choice, 
Ryanair, Monarch, Britannia, Thomas Cook Airlines, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic.
Det Supt Phillips said the men were "career criminals" and some were already known to the police. He said: "They 
knew where the gold bullion was located inside the premises and went straight for it." But he insisted the gang had 
not been allowed to penetrate the company's secure area.

From Mr Matt Andersson.
Sir, With reference to your editorial "Bumpy flight" (May 7) and Lex (May 8), you may have unwittingly revealed the 
essence of the airline dilemma: excess "competition" (not excess capacity per se) to a degree that is now eroding 
the economics of even the most efficient carriers such as Ryanair. But what we are observing in the marketplace is 
not robust competition but robust entry and exit. Marx got it right in this case: competition only eliminates 
competitors.
The root cause of this industry's chronic dysfunction is a deregulation and liberalisation centred on nearly 
uncontrolled open entry, along with pricing freedom, that together are draining rents from the sector. However, like it 
or not, the airline industry, like telecommunications, is a natural monopoly because of its inherent total capital 
intensity, high operating leverage, and resulting network architecture requirements. Indeed, Southwest, EasyJet 
and Ryanair retained effective monopolies as the incumbent low-cost carriers in their respective markets, and this is 
precisely why they have been such strong performers for consumers and investors. You cite Southwest as a 
prodigy of deregulation. Southwest was actually started several years before the 1978 Deregulation Act. 
Deregulation in itself had nothing to do with its success. Limited competition did.
Is it possible that we got our economics wrong? Regulated capacity can allow superior supply economics to be 
realised: a lower long-run average cost curve, lower marginal cost, a lower cost of capital and the capture of rents 
necessary to support the reinvestment requirements of the larger industry, including airport modernisation and 
security. This provides total value to consumers and investors over the long term that no fleeting new entrant could 
deliver. In the meantime, it is the regulatory guiding of pricing and the reinvestment of rents achieved in a quasi-
monopoly that, perhaps ironically, is truly pro-consumer.

British Airways imposes fare surcharge as oil price rises AVIATION:

British Airways has become the first European airline to impose a surcharge on its passenger fares in response to 
the rapid rise in oil prices.
BA said yesterday it would increase its fares by Pounds 2.50 per flight sector or Pounds 5 per return flight on all 
services out of the UK market. It is adding a surcharge of Dollars 4 (Pounds 2.25) per flight sector in all markets 
outside the UK.
US airlines have been seeking to increase fares to reflect higher oil prices for many months but have encountered 
tough resistance from passengers and have often found it difficult to make the rises stick.
In Europe, carriers have until recently been protected from the surge in the price of oil, which is sold in dollars, by 
the weakness of the dollar exchange rate against the euro and sterling.
The dollar has begun to strengthen again, however, in recent weeks leaving European carriers very exposed to the 
jump in the price of jet kerosene.
Several airlines in the Asia Pacific region have taken similar action, including Qantas, the Australian carrier, which 
said it was imposing a surcharge of ADollars 6 (Pounds 2.34) per sector on domestic routes and ADollars 15 on 
international services.
While analysts suggested that other network carriers in Europe were likely to follow the BA example, the carrier met 
a barrage of criticism from Ryanair and EasyJet, the low-cost airlines.
Ray Webster, EasyJet chief executive, said the decision to raise fares would be "disastrously counter-productive for 
British Airways".
He said the higher fares would result in fewer people travelling, lower load factors and less revenue. "If they want to 
fill their aircraft, BA should get the prices right. If they can't make money they should reduce capacity."
British Airways imposes fare surcharge as oil price rises AVIATION:
BA itself has stated repeatedly in recent months that the non-premium market remained very sensitive to fare price 
levels on short-and long-haul routes.
EasyJet and Ryanair said they would not impose fuel surcharges on tickets. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief 
executive, said: "As usual the first instinct of BA and other high-fare airlines is to gouge passengers."
BA is expected to give more guidance on Monday about the financial impact of the rising oil price on its operations, 
when it reports its results for its latest financial year to the end of March.
The fuel and oil bill accounts for 12 to 14 per cent of BA's total costs. It has already warned that the bill would be 
about Pounds 100m higher last year on costs of Pounds 842m in the year to March 2003. It said in March that fuel 
costs could be Pounds 50m higher in the current year to March 2005, but that was before the latest surge in the 
price and the strengthening of the dollar.
The airline has hedged about 30 per cent of its fuel requirements for the first half from April to September and only 
15 per cent for the second half of the financial year.

Body
From Mr Joe R. Gill.
Sir, Your coverage of EasyJet's results (May 6) does not emphasise a critical point. There is only one metric that 
matters as a revolution sweeps through the European airline sector, and it is unit cost.
If a carrier can prove it can sustain the lowest costs in the industry while it builds a pan-European model, it will 
ultimately conquer a market while being profitable. Last January you interpreted revised guidance from Ryanair as a 
signal that its model (secondary airports, deep discount fares) was coming unstuck. That view was endorsed by 
comments from executives at certain European flag-carriers and low-cost airlines.
Since then the realisation has dawned that the price leader in the low-cost industry has chosen to deploy its rising 
capacity aggressively to attain certain goals:
* Key market positions on chosen intra-European routes;
* Send signals to the rest of the industry of an intent to leverage its industry-lowest cost platform. Virtually all 
carriers on short-haul European routes have had to admit over the past three months there is an increasingly 
difficult pricing environment.
While that scenario induces financial losses on most carriers (EasyJet and Alitalia being examples at extreme ends 
of the airline spectrum), Ryanair is maintaining industry-highest earnings before interest and tax margins. In four 
weeks we reckon it will report a net margin of about 20 per cent for the year ending March while adding more than 
40 per cent to its passenger volumes. Over the next year that pattern will be repeated as it adds another 20 per 
cent to capacity at fares on which only it can make money.
That will continue until several of the new entrants acknowledge the folly of their models and withdraw; until charter 
companies accept they cannot evolve profitably into scheduled short-haul operators and until flag-carriers cede 
market share in Europe where they are lossmaking.
 Lowest unit cost leads the way in no frills sector
For EasyJet the challenge is to match the capacity growth of Ryanair while keeping its unit costs under control. The 
experience from the US is that without unit costs that are the lowest in the industry, the scope to trade profitably is 
always under threat. That is why Southwest is still standing and thriving after 30 turbulent years.

The choice of low-cost airlines is becoming ever more exotic. And, whether you live in Bradford, Berlin or Bratislava, 
Newcastle, Nice or Nuremberg, they are coming to an airport near you.
EasyJet, the low-cost industry leader alongside Ryanair, estimates that there are more than 50 low-cost carriers 
flying the airways of Europe. And just as one dies, another start-up is being touted around to potential financial 
backers.
The new entrants are helping to intensify an already raging price war. It is a phenomenon that is proving a boon - 
however temporary - for passengers, who are being lured by discounts and special offers, but that is upsetting 
investors.
EasyJet's share price plunged by 25 per cent in one hectic day's trading this week amid investor fears about the 
impact of all the new competition.
Any self-respecting regional airport now has its resident low-cost carrier: Flyglobespan.com at Glasgow and 
Edinburgh, Jet2.com at Leeds-Bradford, Volareweb.com at Venice, Germanwings at Cologne-Bonn, SkyEurope at 
Bratislava, BMIbaby at Cardiff, to name but a few.
Later this month Wizz Air, a Hungarian start-up, will link London (read Luton) with Krakow (read Katowice) to create 
a service that will be among a host of new routes to be launched from bases in Poland and Hungary as the low-cost 
phenomenon moves east.
Wizz Air is hoping to secure backing from venture capital groups within weeks but it already has Debis AirFinance, 
the leading European aircraft lessor, on board to fund its first aircraft.
Crowding of the sky causes turbulence: TRANSPORT: Low-cost airlines seem to be starting up by the dozen 
but the industry leaders say many won't be around for lo....
The pattern is repeating itself around the globe. Sir Richard Branson has had little joy trying to make sense of Virgin 
Express in Brussels, but he has already pocketed a small fortune from Virgin Blue, his highly successful start-up in 
Australia. He is preparing to roll the dice again in North America with the planned launch of yet another low- cost 
airline into the already crowded US market.
And Asia, in spite of still being a highly regulated aviation market, has also caught the bug. The path has been 
pioneered by Air Asia, started by Tony Fernandes - a former music industry executive from Malaysia who had been 
taken with the glamour of flying since plane-spotting at Heathrow on trips to and from the UK, where he went to 
school. But new competitors are hard on his heels.
The focus is on Singapore with several start-ups on the tarmac, from Tiger Airways, backed by Ireland's Ryan 
family (founders of Ryanair), David Bonderman, the US aviation financier, and the Singapore government's 
Temasek Holdings; to Valuair, planned by former executives of Singapore Airlines; and a venture that is being 
backed by Qantas, the Australian flag carrier, alongside two prominent Singapore businessmen and, again, 
Temasek.
Qantas launches Jetstar, its own domestic low-cost operation, later this month to take up the battle with Virgin Blue 
in Australia.
In Europe, the competition has been intensified by charter airlines trying to rebrand part of their businesses as low-
cost scheduled carriers, and by the traditional network airlines fighting back with their own low-fare offerings.
The resulting turmoil is not, however, making for stress-free flying for travellers or investors.
More than 1,000 passengers of Duo, which was launched last autumn from bases in Birmingham and Edinburgh, 
were stranded last weekend around Europe as the cash ran out and the airline folded.
Passengers with Flying Finn and Ireland's Jetmagic have had similar chastening experiences in recent months as 
the carriers collapsed. Several charter operators have also failed.
Ray Webster, chief executive of EasyJet, warned this week that "there are some desperate airlines out there". He 
added: "Long-term I don't expect them to be flying . . . we are currently seeing unprofitable and unrealistic pricing by 
airlines across all sectors of the European industry, seeking to grow or maintain their market share."
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's mercurial chief executive, was the first to warn of the turmoil to come when earlier this 
year he issued the airline's first profit warning since flotation in 1997. He was rewarded with a 31 per cent one-day 
fall in the airline's share price, which wiped Euros 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) off its market value.
Mr O'Leary said last week the next winter season would be "awful" and forecast continuing fare wars and a shake-
out among the many recent start-ups.
"We will be helping to make it awful," he said cheerfully. "Some will not survive. There will be casualties this winter."
Even Jozsef Varadi, Wizz Air chief executive, agrees that the present situation is "not sustainable".
"We think that across Europe in five to 10 years time there will be three to five viable low-cost operations. Ryanair 
and EasyJet have already quali fied. There is room for two to three more. The market is already overcrowded, but 
there are big opportunities. As a start-up the only place to grow is from central and east Europe."
Both Ryanair and EasyJet, as the low-cost market leaders and the airlines that have gone furthest to establish a 
pan-European presence, are hanging tough. They have been quick to warn their upstart rivals that they have the 
deepest pockets and will not blink first in the fare war.
Crowding of the sky causes turbulence: TRANSPORT: Low-cost airlines seem to be starting up by the dozen 
but the industry leaders say many won't be around for lo....
Mr O'Leary said this week: "History has repeatedly shown that during price wars, the lowest-cost operator wins. In 
the European airline business lowest cost - by a distance - is Ryanair. We will continue to use this cost advantage 
to offer lower fares and take more share from both the high fare and not-so-high fare airlines of Europe."
Many new entrants, attracted by the mouth-watering profit margins achieved in recent years by Ryanair in 
particular, are "losing money on a heroic scale", says Mr O'Leary. "Most will not survive more than 18 to 24 
months."
The two market leaders insist that they will not be leading any more consolidation efforts, having already played 
their part with EasyJet's takeover of Go and Ryanair absorbing Buzz.
In any case, Ryanair and EasyJet will have their hands full for several years absorbing the enormous orders they 
have placed for new aircraft - respectively with Boeing and Airbus.
And, while blaming fare wars and new entrants for their declining yields, Ryanair and EasyJet have played the 
biggest part in undermining their own profitability. They embarked on an unrestrained capacity binge in the wake of 
the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks aimed at taking advantage of the financial woes of the traditional network 
airlines. Only now are they moderating the capacity growth from 50 per cent a year to 20-25 per cent.
The orders mean that there is a wall of new aircraft coming at the European market for the next four years. The 
EasyJet fleet is set to double from 74 at the end of 2003 to 165 at the end of 2007, with Ryanair committed to a 
similar expansion. Both groups are aiming to overtake Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and British Airways to become 
the biggest short-haul carriers in Europe in the second half of the decade.
European aviation has entered a turbulent new phase, and there will be no going back. "We believe the low-cost 
revolution will survive," Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst at ABN Amro, said recently.
"Stag parties will still be able to drink their way around Europe. Villa owners will still reach their places in the sun." 
But the name on the side of the aircraft may change from week to week.

EasyJet this week unsettled the stock market by warning of intense price pressure generated by more than 50 low-
cost airlines operating in Europe. EasyJet's announcement followed similar gloom from Michael O'Leary, chief 
executive of Ryanair, who said that many of the recent start-ups would fail but that, in the meantime, next winter 
would be "awful" for the airlines because of Europe's fare wars.
What is awful for the airlines is not, of course, awful for their passengers, many of whom are finally benefiting from 
the lower fares promised by the deregulation of Europe's aviation market in 1997. But travellers should enjoy the 
cheap flights while they can. While fares are unlikely to return to their pre-deregulation levels, the eye-catchingly 
low special offers cannot stay that way forever.
The low-cost airline shake-out promised by Mr O'Leary will almost certainly happen. Europe is set to follow the 
pattern set by the US when its airline market was deregulated in 1978. Asia, just beginning its own aviation 
deregulation, should observe closely.
In the US, many low-fares airlines set up shop, but few have survived. The most successful of them all, Southwest 
Airlines, the model for no-frills carriers everywhere, has been joined by a handful of others: JetBlue and AirTran, 
which was known as ValuJet until an aircraft crash in the Florida Everglades in 1996 almost destroyed its business 
and forced it into a change of name.
Europe's low-fares sector is less mature. Many would say the same of Mr O'Leary, who is much given to fruity 
language when talking about travel agents or customers who demand refunds. Nevertheless, Ryanair is expected 
by most analysts to be among the low-cost survivors, as is EasyJet. Most of the remaining 50 are expected to 
disappear. Duo, a UK-based operator, collapsed at the weekend.
Aviation is a difficult industry in which to survive. The low-cost airlines avoid many of the problems of the full-service 
carriers. They have less restrictive working practices and can demand greater productivity from their crews, with 
more flights each day and less time hanging around at airports. Fixed costs are high, margins are slim and price 
wars can easily force poorly capitalised airlines into bankruptcy. Nor, as ValuJet showed, can airlines compromise 
on safety.
 Seatbelts fastened for a bumpy flight: Few of Europe's low-cost airlines will survive
Not that life is much easier for the big carriers, as demonstrated by the Italian government's unveiling yesterday of 
yet another plan to stop Alitalia from going under. The US airlines have yet to emerge from their worst period since 
commercial flight began.
Why do people start new airlines? "Maybe it's sex appeal, but there's something about an airplane that drives 
investors crazy," Alfred Kahn, architect of American airline deregulation, once observed. Warren Buffett jokes that 
there is a counselling helpline he calls if he is ever tempted to buy airline shares. Potential investors should ask him 
for the number.

British Airways traffic volumes rose sharply in April from the low level of a year ago, when demand was depressed 
by the war in Iraq and the outbreak of Sars. Passenger traffic increased by 16.1 per cent and included a 28.1 per 
cent rise in premium traffic and a 14.5 per cent increase in non-premium volumes.
Ryanair, the leading European low-cost carrier, increased its passenger numbers by 45 per cent in April, but 
warned that it continued to see no change in the "very competitive market conditions" on short-haul routes in 
Europe. It managed to fill 82 per cent of its available seats compared with 79 per cent a year ago.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, who warned last week that Ryanair yields or average fare levels could fall 
by between 5 and 20 per cent this year, said he expected "the coming year to be tough and the winter to be 
particularly difficult". Kevin Done

Turbulence can disrupt the best-laid of flight plans. Intensifying competition in the low-cost airline market has finally 
forced EasyJet to downgrade its upbeat view of its outlook. 
Its belated move to sound a note of caution has understandably undermined confidence in both the airline and the 
low-cost sector. The change of mood will particularly disappoint investors who switched into EasyJet following 
Ryanair's shock warning in January.
But the market reaction to EasyJet's new outlook is overdone. The change is not on the scale of the Ryanair 
warning, where the impact of pressure on fares was heightened by indigestion resulting from its rapid capacity 
expansion. EasyJet did suffer disappointing fare levels in April but that seems a blip. The carrier only expects a 
slight easing of yields in the current year. The longer-term impact of rising competition is more uncertain. EasyJet 
estimates that there are more than 50 low-cost airlines in Europe, plus charter operations. It is right to forecast that 
these airlines cannot continue their "irrational" pricing indefinitely - there will inevitably be a messy consolidation.
In the meantime, downward pressure on pricing will persist. But with the competitive advantages of scale, strong 
branding and established networks, EasyJet and Ryanair are well placed to ride out the turbulence. And EasyJet is 
now trading on less than 9 times 2005 earnings. Despite the industry uncertainty, that seems an unwarranted 
discount to Ryanair and the UK market.

Ray Webster, EasyJet chief executive, appeared shell-shocked yesterday by the tumble in the airline's share price 
after he injected a new note of caution into the group's profits guidance for the second half of the year.
Investors, who had become used to stellar earnings from their low-cost airline stocks, have punished carriers when 
they have delivered nasty surprises.
The 25 per cent fall in EasyJet's shares yesterday followed a 31 per cent fall in the Ryanair share price in one day 
in late January when the rival Irish low-cost carrier issued its first profit warning since its flotation in 1997.
By the standards of the sector, EasyJet's statement yesterday scarcely qualified at face value as a "nasty".
In February, the company had said it was "cautiously optimistic" about the outlook for the full year but it was forced 
to backtrack yesterday.
"Given the increasingly competitive market place it is appropriate now to be cautious about the performance for the 
full financial year," Mr Webster said.
However, he said the airline still expected growth in earnings per share (before goodwill, amortisation and 
exceptional items) for the 12 months to the end of September. And, in contrast to Ryanair's dire warnings of a fall in 
yields or average fare levels of between 5 and 20 per cent for the coming year, Mr Webster forecast little change 
during the summer.
The market has been undermined by Ryanair's warnings of a continuing severe price war, mounting competition 
from new low-cost airlines across Europe and threat of a drastic shake-up to come with many casualties expected 
among the smaller operators.
Mr Webster's caution was enough to push the EasyJet share price over the cliff.
EasyJet tumble 'over-reaction': Investors punish airline for what analysts call 'small change in guidance', writes 
Kevin Done
Chris Avery, aviation analyst at JP Morgan, said the steep fall seemed "a bizarre reaction to what was meant to be 
a small change in guidance". He added: "We ...see today's weakness as a good opportunity to buy."
Mr Webster's warnings overshadowed the airline's improvement in the first half, with sharply reduced losses in the 
six months to the end of March. Traditionally, EasyJet generates its profits in its second half from April to 
September.
In the first half, EasyJet reduced its loss (before goodwill, exceptional items and tax) by 24.2 per cent from Pounds 
24.4m to Pounds 18.5m.
Its pre-tax loss fell from Pounds 48.1m to Pounds 27.3m, reflecting the absence of Pounds 5.6m of charges for 
integrating Go, the rival airline taken over in 2002, and the Pounds 7.9m charge a year ago for terminating the 
option to take over Deutsche BA.
Turnover in the first half increased by 18 per cent from Pounds 373m to Pounds 440m while passenger numbers 
rose by 15.9 per cent to 10.8m. The average fare rose by 1.6 per cent to Pounds 38.06.
Most importantly, it achieved a slightly higher average fare compared with Ryanair's forecast for a 25-30 per cent 
fall.

European airlines faced mounting turmoil yesterday as EasyJet shares fell by 25 per cent in response to 
intensifying fare wars and mounting competition from a host of new low-cost carriers, and Alitalia shares were 
suspended in Italy.
Ray Webster, chief executive of EasyJet, one of the two leading European low-cost airlines, said: "We are seeing 
unprofitable and unrealistic pricing by airlines across all sectors of the European industry, seeking to grow or 
maintain their market share." He said growing competitive pressure could undermine the group's performance in the 
second half of the year, when it traditionally generates all its profits.
In Italy shares in Alitalia, the Italian majority state-owned flag carrier, were suspended before an expected board 
meeting today as the group held talks with the government and trade unions to avert bankruptcy amid mounting 
losses.
Several small scheduled and charter carriers have collapsed in France, Germany and Belgium in recent months. 
Duo, launched last year at Birmingham and Edinburgh airports, became the latest casualty in the European aviation 
industry at the weekend when it collapsed, leaving more than 1,000 passengers stranded and with the immediate 
loss of 260 jobs.
Last week Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the next winter season would be "awful" in the European 
airline sector amid continuing fare wars and a shake-out among the many recent start-up low-cost airlines.
In spite of the failures, a spate of start-up airlines are continuing to enter the low-cost market, attracted by the high 
profit margins previously achieved by the market leaders, Ryanair and EasyJet, and contributing to widespread 
price dumping.
Yesterday Mr Webster said there were already more than 50 low-cost carriers operating in Europe. "There are 
some desperate airlines out there . . . . Long term I don't expect them to be flying."
 EasyJet takes brunt of airline sector woes
At least four German low-cost carriers, Germanwings, Hapag-Lloyd Express, Air Berlin and Germania Express, are 
fighting over the German market in addition to Ryanair and EasyJet.
The low-cost airline phenomenon is rapidly moving eastwards, helped by European Union enlargement. This month 
Wizz Air will be launched, led by Jozsef Varadi, a former chief executive of Malev, the Hungarian flag carrier, who is 
starting a network first from Katowice, Poland, to be followed by a second base in Budapest in June.
A rival start-up, SkyEurope Airlines, has added new bases in Budapest and Warsaw to its home base in Bratislava, 
the Slovak capital.
Mr Webster said EasyJet would still increase its underlying earnings per share in the year to the end of September. 
The airline reported significantly lower losses for the first half.
But investors were unnerved by the company's disclosure that demand in the second half of April had softened "due 
to competitive pressure and a weaker than expected Easter", while in May passenger numbers were "tracking 
slightly lower than our expectations". Numbers were "currently as anticipated" for June.
"Given the increasingly competitive marketplace, it is appropriate now to be cautious about the performance for the 
full financial year," Mr Webster said.
In April EasyJet's share of available seats filled dropped year-on-year from 85 to 82 per cent, one of the biggest 
declines for months. Its average fares fell in April by 5 per cent after rising by 1.6 per cent in the six months from 
October to March.
The EasyJet share price closed 73 1/4p, or 25.1 per cent lower at 219p, wiping Pounds 288m off its market 
capitalisation. Observer, Page 20 Lex, Page 22 Over-reaction, Page 24 Amadeus acquisitive, Page 30 Alitalia

Budget airlines challenge new EU regulations

Low-cost airlines, including Ryanair, yesterday launched a legal challenge to new European Union regulations that 
could force them to pay out hundreds of euros in compensation if a passenger's flight is delayed for reasons 
beyond their control.
The airlines, which filed their claim in the High Court in London yesterday, are asking for a judicial review of the 
regulations, which were published earlier this year and are set to come into force next February.
The claimants, represented by the European Low Fares Airline Association, say the regulations are unfairly 
punative and could put their "low-fares" model at risk.
"The legislation is particularly damaging to low-fares airlines as there is no linkage of the penalties imposed to the 
fares paid," said Wolfgang Kurth, association president and chief executive of the German carrier Hapag-Lloyd 
Express.
"It is also discriminatory as it does not apply to competing forms of transport, such as trains and ferries. The effect 
of the regulation will be to deny consumers the choice to travel at the lowest possible fares."
The new EU rules are designed, in part, to tackle the problem of passengers "bumped" from flights because of 
overbooking - an aspect which is not being challenged by the airlines. But the new regime also broadens the scope 
of the compensation regime and increases required payment levels for flights that are seriously delayed or 
cancelled.
The association claims this means that carriers could face penalties for delays and cancellations in situations over 
which they have no control, which it maintains "is in direct conflict with an already existing international agreement".
The low-cost carriers' challenge comes hot on the heels of a similar judicial review claim by the International Air 
Transport Association, representing carriers generally, which was filed last month. Like the association, Iata wants 
to block the introduction of the new regulations, although its arguments differ slightly from those put forward by the 
low-cost airlines.
Budget airlines challenge new EU regulations
Iata, for example, is concerned about the requirement that compensation options must include a return flight to the 
original point of departure. It points out that, on a multi-coupon ticket, a carrier experiencing delay on one portion of 
the trip could be held responsible for the entire ticket.
Giovanni Bisignani, Iata director-general, has described the EU regulations "misguided and poorly conceived", and 
warned that they jeopardise the future of short-haul connecting services to long-haul flights.

The effects of low fares and overcapacity in the Scandinavian airline market were underlined yesterday when SAS, 
the region's largest carrier, reported another heavy first-quarter loss.
Jorgen Lindegaard, chief executive, described the results as "very weak" and said that due to price-cutting, yield 
per passenger had fallen by 15 per cent in the region, a development that was "historically unique".
"New players have led to overcapacity, particularly in the Scandinavian market, which has resulted in very low 
fares. In some markets prices are at levels where no player is making money," he added.
SAS has been under intense competition from low-cost carriers such as Ryanair for several years but more recently 
it has been challenged by smaller start-ups flying domestic and inter-Nordic routes.
Although SAS increased the number of passengers it carried by 7.3 per cent in the first quarter, this was done 
largely through price reductions and special low-fare travel offers.
In the three months to March 31 the company made a pre-tax loss of SKr1.583bn (Dollars 208m) compared with a 
loss of SKr1.876bn in the same period a year earlier. Sales fell 8 per cent to SKr12.567bn.
Mr Lindegaard said that in February and March there was evidence that customers were returning to air travel.
In March alone, volumes were up 10 per cent.
However, due to overcapacity, average ticket revenues were rising slower than in previous, similar periods.
Revenues would continue to fall in 2004 compared with a year earlier, as passengers moved from business to 
economy seats and SAS continued to offer lower fares, he said.
The group reiterated its forecast of reaching a full-year pre-tax profit in 2004, excluding non-recurring items.
Competition and low fares depress SAS AIR TRAVEL:
In March, SAS, which is part-owned by the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian governments, embarked on a new 
cost-cutting drive that will involve the splitting of the SAS airlines into four units.
"We are now creating a foundation for sustainable, profitable development and later this year we should be able to 
see this positive trend," Mr Lindegaard said.
In Stockholm, shares in SAS gained 3 per cent to close at SKr69.

Duo, a low-cost airline operating from Birmingham and Edinburgh, has collapsed as the result of a failed 
refinancing, leaving about 1,200 passengers stranded overseas.
The failure of the business, which relied on the internet for bookings, reflects the ferocity of price competition among 
airlines and could presage a serious shake out.
Last week, Michael O'Leary, head of Ryanair, the no-frills market leader, predicted a "bloodbath" as falling fares 
forced uncompetitive carriers to fold.
EasyJet, which reports its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, said the collapse of Duo would bring "a severe 
dose of reality" to the UK airlines business. An official said: "The problem with Duo was that they didn't have 
particularly deep pockets. To compete, you do need an awful lot of cash."
Duo had been trading for less than a year, offering return flights to more than 12 European destinations including 
Berlin, Nice and Geneva for as little as Pounds 49.
Customers stranded in continental Europe are unlikely to get refunds as they had booked tickets on the internet, 
which are not protected in the Atol system.
Compensation from the administrators, Bill Dawson and Andrew Peters of Deloitte, is also unlikely as Duo is 
understood to have had significant debts.
Mr Dawson said Duo had failed because "revenues had not been as high as anticipated, and although bookings 
had been growing, additional funds were required to enable the airline to continue".
Mr Dawson said an investor had advanced these funds, but more money was needed after disappointing trading in 
March, which directors had been unable to secure in time to save Duo.
Passengers stranded as low-cost Duo collapses TRANSPORT:
Management bought the business, last June, from AP Moller, the Scandinavian industrial group. At that time, the 
airline was called Maersk and operated as a franchisee of British Airways. No financial institution backed the buy-
out, which is thought to have been for a nominal sum.
The buy-out team was led by Peter Spencer, former head of BA's Americas operation, and Rod Lynch, another 
one-time BA executive. As chief executive and chairman, they hatched a strategy to offer business class services at 
economy prices. They abandoned the BA franchise to rebrand under an independent identity, last November, partly 
as a way of cutting costs.
The airline employed more than 300 people, and operated seven aircraft.

* EasyJet, the low-cost airline, is expected to report, this week, a loss before tax, exceptional charges and goodwill 
for its first half from October to March, down from Pounds 24.4m in the same period last year, to about Pounds 18m 
this time. Traditionally, the group has generated the majority of its profits in the final quarter of its financial year 
September 30, and current trading is following the same seasonal pattern. Ryanair, EasyJet's big rival, has issued 
dire warnings falling average fare levels and a looming shake-up in the low-cost sector in the face of continuing fare 
wars and a host of new competitors. One of those, Birmingham-based Duo, collapsed at the weekend. Ray 
Webster, EasyJet chief executive, has told investors that the group's load factors (the share of available seats sold) 
and yields for its first half (October to March) were "anticipated to be above last year". The market will be eager to 
hear whether he has any reason to change the existing guidance of being "cautiously optimistic" about the group's 
performance for the full financial year to the end of September. He told the annual meeting, two months ago, that 
for the full year EasyJet expected slightly improved load factors and a similar yield compared with last year.
* Anglo Irish, which rode the "Celtic tiger" better than other Irish banks, is expected to report another 30 per cent 
increase in earnings in the six months to March 31. Part of the explanation is a change in provisioning policy. Until 
now, Anglo's general provision - the amount it puts aside to cover anticipated future bad debts - has been more 
conservative than Irish rivals and three times the European average. The change will result in a one-off gain. But 
underlying earnings are still running at an impressive 18 per cent, which is way ahead of both AIB and Bank of 
Ireland.
* Big Yellow, the storage group, is expected to announce its first full-year profit, continuing the trend that saw the 
group move into the black at the interim stage. Cazenove, broker to Big Yellow, forecasts profit before exceptional 
items for the year to March 31 of Pounds 1.2m, compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.8m in 2003. The market will 
also be interested in Big Yellow's future funding options, following its storage site roll-out programme.
* NTL will report first-quarter results and will hold an annual meeting for shareholders in New York the following day. 
Analysts expect the UK's largest cable company, which is listed on the Nasdaq exchange and incorporated in 
Delaware, to report revenue of Pounds 582m-Pounds 592m in the first quarter and earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation of Pounds 192m-Pounds 195m. The earnings report follows the successful

completion of the company's refinancing. Last month, the company, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
early last year, launched an Pounds 800m bond offering and negotiated a new Pounds 2.43bn credit facility. Last 
year, NTL narrowed its net loss by 63 per cent to Pounds 584m - investors will be keen to see whether the 
company will continue the trend.

* The regular news flow from Blacks, including an update in January, should mean that there are no big surprises 
from the outdoor and boardwear specialist. Today's full-year results should be in line with expectations with a more 
than 60 per cent rise in profits. But heading into the first few weeks of the new year, the group could suffer from the 
strong comparable like-for-like sales in the run-up to the end of April last year. Also given the recent unseasonable 
weather, likely to have deterred anyone thinking of spending any considerable time under canvas or outdoors, 
trading in the past eight weeks might be slightly softer. Analysts are predicting full-year profits of about Pounds 
17.4m as the group carries on showing is resilience on the increasingly tough high street. Like-for-like sales should 
be about 3 per cent higher, with total sales up 10 per cent. Earnings per share are forecast at of 28.6p with a 
dividend of 7.8p.

Highlight: In 2001, Aer Lingus knew it was in trouble. But rather than relying on its proud history, and going under, 
the airline was prepared to do anything to survive - even copying a young upstart called Ryanair. Willie Walsh, CEO 
of Aer Lingus, explains his strategy to Elizabeth Stephens.
Body
After the collapse of Sabena and Swissair the big question in Europe was which flag carrier would be next. The 
general consensus was that Greece's Olympic Airways would probably hold on (well, it had held on for so long 
already) and that the next to go would be Aer Lingus. 
As anyone at Ireland's flag carrier will tell you, bankruptcy was not that far away - and the only reason that Aer 
Lingus is still flying is that the management and staff realized they were in trouble too. "We drew up a detailed 
survival plan in autumn 2001 and aimed to reduce costs by 16%," says Willie Walsh, CEO of Aer Lingus. "It took us 
five or six months to achieve our goal and we realized there was still more we could do."
The airline cut labour costs, reducing the workforce by almost 30% between 2001 and 2003. It now employs 4,281 
people. "Only 20% of our savings came through staffing cuts," says Walsh. "We looked at every aspect of the 
business and found ways to derive better value for the money we spent."
To cut costs further the airline did something which would have been unthinkable a few years before - it decided to 
see what it could learn from its biggest competitors, including arch-rival, Ryanair. "You have to benchmark yourself 
against someone who can teach you about costs," says Walsh, "and the successful low-cost carriers can do that."
As well as cutting staff numbers the airline made it a priority to shift customers to its website. In 2001, just 8% of all 
bookings were online; by 2003 it was 50%. In total the airline cut its costs by 30%.
Rather than just using savings to boost its margins, it followed other low-costs again and decided to pass on some 
of the difference to its customers by cutting ticket prices. The average short-haul fare fell from (EURO)103.10 
($123) in 2001 to (EURO)82.52 in 2003.
Aer Lingus also examined its routes and changed its approach to deciding where it flew. Traditionally, the 
management team would spend months analysing the viability of a daily service to a new destination and the 
potential to move towards a double daily service as frequency of flights to each destination was viewed as key. This 
is no longer the rule. "We no longer require a daily service to launch a new route," says Walsh. "One flight a week is 
enough, although we ideally like three." As a result, the airline has experienced unprecedented route development 
Ireland 's other low-cost
in the past two years, with the launch of 28 new destinations served around Europe. This has doubled the number 
of destinations it serves. Passenger numbers have also increased to 6,594,650 in 2003 from 6,210,891 in 2002.
In the past the airline had planned new routes based on business-class demand, but they decided to change this 
approach. One example was the airline's route to Milan. Although the carrier had been confident that this would be 
a popular business-class route in November 2001, the airline discovered that it was not getting enough passengers.
Rather than trusting its analysis, the airline decided to act on instincts and launch a new route to Malaga in Spain. It 
regularly flies an A330 to Malaga with an 84% load factor. "This approach makes decision-making a hell of a lot 
easier and more flexible," says Walsh, "and we're not afraid to try things now. We used to work on the assumption 
that new routings would be loss making in the first year, whereas now we expect them to be profitable."
One key belief that the airline shares with its low-cost competitors is that there is little need for business-class travel 
on short-haul flights of less than four hours and that airlines can no longer rely on this business. 
Most Europeans expected to see an upturn in business-class travel in the fourth quarter of 2002 and when this did 
not occur, Walsh says the fundamental shift in the air travel market became more apparent. Aer Lingus suffered a 
drop in business-class travel from 13% in 2001 to 7% in 2003. 
In October 2002, the carrier altered the pricing for business-class travel and introduced fully flexible economy fares. 
Whereas in the past, certain clients bought business-class tickets purely to take advantage of their flexibility, a 
slightly higher-than-usual priced economy ticket provides them with the same benefits. 
As the underlying demand for business-class travel on short-haul routings is limited, Aer Lingus has terminated the 
option on many of its services. Business-class is now only available on flights to Heathrow, Amsterdam, Brussels 
and Frankfurt. 
Aer Lingus also decided it could save money by using newer, more efficient, single-type aircraft on its new short-
haul routes. 
Although Aer Lingus was operating A320s, Walsh had worked with 737-800s when he was CEO of Spanish charter 
airline Futura, a former Aer Lingus subsidiary.
He describes both aircraft as "excellent" and says the decision was a close call. Timing proved to be the decisive 
factor. Aer Lingus wanted to make the transition to a single fleet as swiftly as possible and Airbus could complete 
the transaction a year ahead of Boeing. So it ordered 17 A320s powered by CFM56 engines. 
It took delivery of the first A320 in April and it was in service at 7.30am the following morning. Another six aircraft 
will be delivered this year, with a further 10 scheduled for delivery in 2005.
A big benefit of the financial turnaround for Aer Lingus is that it is in the enviable position of being able to purchase 
seven of the aircraft outright through internal resources. At the end of 2003 the carrier had (EURO)384.8 million in 
free cash and (EURO)226.2 in cash and liquid resources on its balance sheet. 
The aircraft that are going out of service are being sold to ILFC through sale/leasebacks. Eight of the 737s will be 
returned, which will leave four remaining aircraft to be disposed of. 
Thinking global
Once Aer Lingus had completed its evaluation of its short-haul operations, attention turned to the long-haul market. 
It applied a similar strategy of cutting ticket prices to encourage demand. The average transatlantic fare in 2003 
was (EURO)250.97, compared with (EURO)327.77 in 2001. 
"People will fly at the right price," says Walsh. The number of passengers the airline carried rose 19% in 2003 and 
has proved him right. The airline's transatlantic flights are operating with a record 89% load factor.
Ireland 's other low-cost
Having stimulated demand, Walsh says, the airline is being restricted by regulation, particularly bilateral 
agreements. Ireland's agreement with the US restricts Aer Lingus flights to five destinations: New York, Boston, 
Chicago and Los Angeles, with an extra bilateral agreement enabling it to service Washington, Baltimore. These 
services operate from Dublin and Shannon and, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, 50% of flights must 
originate at Shannon. In contrast, there are no routing restrictions for the US carriers operating services to Ireland.
Aer Lingus has been campaigning against the anticompetitive nature of the agreement for the past 18 months. The 
management team is in favour of an open-skies policy that will provide additional access to other US destinations. 
"Our services are artificially repressed by the restrictive bilateral agreement and we could double our transatlantic 
traffic in three to five years if we were permitted to serve other destinations," says Walsh. 
San Francisco, Philadelphia, Dallas and either Miami or Orlando top the list of desired routings. Two-thirds of the 
airline's transatlantic travel originates in the US and is generated by inbound tourism. 
The carrier operates four A330-300s and three A330-200s on its transatlantic routes. Three of the aircraft are 
owned outright, while the leases on the other four expire in 2005 and 2006. This provides the ideal opportunity for 
Aer Lingus to move towards the standardization and expansion of its long-haul fleet. 
The management team is in the process of comparing the A330 with the 7E7. "The 7E7 is an attractive aircraft and 
could fit in with the requirements we have over a 15-year time horizon," says Walsh. The only negative is that the 
7E7 is not available until 2009, which would mean extending the leases on the existing aircraft and slowing the 
move towards standardization. 
The airline's financial results in 2002 and 2003 have left the carrier in a stronger position to face the future than 
before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In 2003, it had a record 9.3% margin. The medium-term target is 
15%. 
Despite this success, Walsh is far from complacent. He believes yields will continue to fall, dropping between 8% to 
10% per cent in 2005 as a result of low fares. His future strategy is simple and similar to other low-costs: "manage 
costs, deliver customer service and get more customers." 
Overall, Walsh is optimistic. He says: "With the right business model and reputation for good service, it is possible 
to be profitable through good times and bad. It is incredible what you can achieve."

BAA said yesterday that it would submit a planning application during the next 12 months to expand London 
Stansted Airport to handle 35m passengers annually, barely 12 months after receiving permission to move to 25m a 
year.
Stansted is Europe's fastest growing larger airport and BAA said yesterday that there was "now every prospect" 
that 25m passengers a year would be reached sometime during 2006 rather than the originally 2010 date.
In the latest 12 months to the end of March, Stansted increased its passenger traffic by 15.9 per cent to 19.4m led 
chiefly by the growth of Ryanair and EasyJet, the leading European low-cost airlines, and other no-frills carriers 
such as Germanwings and Air Berlin. Aircraft movements rose by 7 per cent to 173,234.
Stansted is also expected to double again in size by the middle of the next decade with the building of the first new 
runway in the south-east of England for half a century.
The Pounds 2bn project, Stansted Generation 2, has been backed by the government, and BAA said yesterday that 
it would submit a formal planning application in late 2005.
It said it had appointed Grimshaw, the firm of architects, to begin design work for the lay out of the airport, including 
the new terminal and other principal buildings.
Grimshaw's commissions include the Eden Project in Cornwall, the Eurostar terminal at London's Waterloo station, 
the new British Airways terminal at Manchester airport, and terminal facilities at Zurich airport.
BAA, which also operates Heathrow and Gatwick airports, is aiming to start operations from the second runway in 
2012, despite facing a series of legal challenges.
The expansion is aimed at taking the airport over time to a capacity to handle 80m passengers a year.

British companies are at risk of falling behind as the global centre of gravity shifts towards emerging economies, 
according to the head of the Institute of Directors.
"Everyone knows we live in a fast-changing world. 
Everyone knows that it is increasingly competitive," said George Cox, director-general of the employers' group. "But 
few really understand how it is changing or recognise how competitive it is becoming."
Emerging markets were increasingly "punching above their weight", he said. "The global centre of gravity is shifting. 
Within the next two decades, the dollar amount of annual GDP growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China combined 
will exceed that in the G7."
The IoD will hold its annual convention at the Royal Albert Hall, London, today. Speakers include Michael O'Leary, 
chief executive of Ryanair, the low-fare carrier, Barbara Cassani, who chairs London's 2012 Olympic Games bid, 
Michael Howard, the Conservative party leader, and Gordon Brown, the chancellor, who will vow to put economic 
stability "first, now and in the future".
Mr Cox will debate the future of UK business with Digby Jones, director- general of the CBI employers' group, David 
Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, and Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC.
One of the greatest threats to jobs, said Mr Cox, was the offshoring of work to countries such as India and China.
"We are not just talking about call centres, help lines or telesales. These are just the start," he said.

Ryanair may again consider acquiring second-hand narrowbodies as it expects increased availability of used 
Boeing 737s returned by anticipated casualties in the European low-cost carrier segment. The carrier also says it 
expects to have re-worded all of its contentious deals with public airports to bring them in line with European law by 
the end of April.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary says he expects there to be a surplus of 737s and Airbus A320s on the market 
before the end of the year as a series of no-frills new entrants leave the market "either by bankruptcy, merger or 
acquisition". The airline would consider taking secondhand 737-300s or -400s from any such retiring carrier, if the 
price were low enough. Ryanair took delivery of its 51st 189-seat 737-800 last month and to date has 155 
confirmed -800 orders with 123 options over the next six years.
Retirement of six of the carrier's remaining fleet of 15 737-200s will take place by the end of this year. There are 
believed to be certain routes that would benefit from the 149-seat -300 or 168-seat -400 and Ryanair operates six 
737-300s with its Buzz Stansted subsidiary. O'Leary says integration of further smaller Next Generation 737 models 
would be no problem.
Meanwhile, O'Leary also says the airline has amended around 14 of the 20 deals with publicly owned airports that 
might contravene European state-aid rules. He warns that if airport operators use this as a excuse to raise fees 
Ryanair will cancel the deals.

Body
It has been another tough year for Europe's aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) providers. The 
region's carriers have been continuing to retire or store the older aircraft that are the bedrock of the overhaul sector 
and in-flight entertainment upgrades and other outfitting work has not been coming along quickly enough to fill the 
gap. Too many companies chasing too little work has led to an overcapacity crisis. In January -- just before 
announcing a merger with Swiss maintenance provider SR Technics -- Danish-owned FLS announced it was 
shutting its UK-based heavy maintenance centres in Manchester and Stansted and concentrating its operations at 
its Dublin site. It is no big secret that other MRO companies have hangars that are at times worryingly empty. With 
lower-cost countries -- including, it has to be said, the European Union's new eastern entrants (see feature P40) -- 
competing hard for maintenance work, many within the sector believe that the way out of the mire rests with 
providing not just ever cheaper hourly rates and faster turnarounds, but offering value-added service packages and 
"maintenance solutions".
 
Survival strategy
Antoine Gelain, director of London-based aerospace analysts High Strategy, says: "MRO providers need to select 
the market segments they want to serve and which they will dedicate most of their investments and resources to. 
This is the only way they will get back into profitability in the medium-term. As for now, short-term prospects are still 
bleak."
Adding value; For Europe's MRO providers, winning the hearts of airline customers is no longer about providing 
cheapest labour rates, but genuine service and in....
Transition checks, interior work and in-flight entertainment installations are brighter spots amid the gloom. "There is 
transition work and there is Boeing's Connexion [onboard internet] conversions for some customers, such as SAS," 
says Declan Fitzpatrick, avionics and interior design manager for FLS Aerospace in Dublin. He splits the market 
into three distinct tiers -- low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, which are "simply not interested" in cabin 
refurbishments; regular "mid-market" flag carriers who often see it as a necessary investment in order to retain 
passengers; and long-haul, highly brand-conscious airlines such as Virgin who see distinct interiors and the whole 
in-flight experience as a positive selling point.
While adding value has been crucial to the survival of Europe's maintenance companies, the other driver has been 
the search for efficiencies. For Holger Dietsch, vice-president for maintenance for Airbus A310 and A300 and 
Boeing 747 and 777 at Europe's biggest MRO provider, Lufthansa Technik, the key has been "a more industrial 
approach". This has seen the company "using methods of lean production, examining paper information flow and 
work flow, to find substantial savings. We looked into it [lean production techniques] four or five years ago, and we 
have gained 10-18% savings."
Engine maker Rolls-Royce is taking a similar approach. David Hygate, Rolls-Royce director of marketing and 
business development for repair and overhaul, says the company is taking the automotive industry's lean 
production techniques a step further. The company's new Trent 800 overhaul shop in Derby, which opens next 
year, "applies new car production techniques such as 'just in time'to overhaul".
As well as automotive production techniques, Rolls-Royce is introducing new technologies including real-time X-ray 
inspection, water-jet cleaning, laser-aided coating deposition and cryogenic cleaning. Laser deposition is a method 
of reconditioning a blade, while cryogenic cleaning has engines blasted with very cold CO2. It is a way of cleaning 
fan blades without having to perform the time-intensive task of disassembling the engine.
Another logistics project is known as "40-day wing-to-wing"; it is a project with a five-year horizon, and is "a difficult 
challenge", according to Hygate. The project seeks to enable an engine, taken from an aircraft in the likes of 
Malaysia, to be transported to a facility possibly half way round the world and then returned within 40 days.
The increasing mobility of computing power has been a factor in allowing MRO companies to become more 
effective. Dietsch says mobile computers are enabling his engineers to draw on knowledge previously left on the 
design drawing board: "We are looking into palmtops or personal digital assistants (PDA). We made some tests 
with the reporting system, because they are very cheap to buy, just [euro]200 [$240] each. A PDA is small and you 
can really use it anywhere. The mechanics can use such technology to access documentation and reliability data."
In theory, a networked information system for data access could be used worldwide and Lufthansa Techink is not 
the only company interested. Air Canada and IBM have been jointly developing a wireless e-tool that gives airline 
mechanics access to electronic documents and an airline's maintenance system data. And component condition-
monitoring systems, still in development with several companies, could inform a maintenance crew of just what is 
needed before an aircraft reaches its overhaul hangar (Flight International, 14 Jan 2003).

Ryanair may again consider acquiring second-hand narrowbodies as it expects increased availability of used 
Boeing 737s returned by anticipated casualties in the European low-cost carrier segment. The carrier also says it 
expects to have re-worded all of its contentious deals with public airports to bring them in line with European law by 
the end of April.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary says he expects there to be a surplus of 737s and Airbus A320s on the market 
before the end of the year as a series of no-frills new entrants leave the market "either by bankruptcy, merger or 
acquisition". The airline would consider taking secondhand 737-300s or -400s from any such retiring carrier, if the 
price were low enough. Ryanair took delivery of its 51st 189-seat 737-800 last month and to date has 155 
confirmed -800 orders with 123 options over the next six years.
Retirement of six of the carrier's remaining fleet of 15 737-200s will take place by the end of this year. There are 
believed to be certain routes that would benefit from the 149-seat -300 or 168-seat -400 and Ryanair operates six 
737-300s with its Buzz Stansted subsidiary. O'Leary says integration of further smaller Next Generation 737 models 
would be no problem.
Meanwhile, O'Leary also says the airline has amended around 14 of the 20 deals with publicly owned airports that 
might contravene European state-aid rules. He warns that if airport operators use this as a excuse to raise fees 
Ryanair will cancel the deals.

 (ANSA) - Rome, April 27 - Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair will increase the number of transported passengers on 
its destinations from and to Italy to 15 million by 2008, the company's CEO, Michael O'Leary, forecast on April 27, 
2004.
 The low-cost carrier expects to serve 7. 5 million passengers from and to Italy in 2004.
The company served a total 13 million passengers from and to Italy since 1998, O'Leary said.
 Ryanair will launch five new routes in Italy in the autumn of 2004, of a total 20 in Europe. The company is currently 
in negotiations with six Italian airports, O'Leary said. The Irish air carrier launched two routes in Italy in the spring of 
2004. Ryanair sees its net profit to reach 200 mln euro ($ 236. 7 mln) in 2004 and the number of passengers to rise 
25 pct year-on-year to between 28 million and 29 million in Europe in 2004. (ANSA).

 (ANSA) - Rome, April 27 - The only way for Italian national carrier Alitalia SpA to recover its market position is to 
reduce prices, CEO of Irish low-cost airline Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, said on April 27, 2004.
 No government subsidies can protect Alitalia from the competition, O'Leary added.
According to him, if Ryanair sells 90 pct of the seats on one of its Rome-London flights, and Alitalia only sells 50 
pct, the only way for the Italian company to catch up on those 40 pct is to lower prices.
 O'Leary went on to say that Alitalia did not suffer from the entrance of Ryanair on the Italian market. Ryanair 
started flights from and to Italy in 1998, and the number of passengers transported by Alitalia on European 
destinations remained stable at 7. 5 million, he said. Alitalia is registering losses not because of the competition, but 
because of low efficiency and higher prices, he added.
 Asked if Ryanair is interested in buying Alitalia, O'Leary said that the Irish carrier was only interested in profitable 
airlines. (ANSA).

O'Leary forecasts an 'awful' winter for European airlines

Body
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, forecast an "awful" winter season for the European airline sector, amid 
continuing fare wars and a shake-out among the many low-cost airlines.
And he warned: "We will be helping to make it awful. Some will not survive. There will be casualties this winter."
Mr O'Leary, who surprised investors two months ago by issuing Ryanair's first profits warning since flotation in 
1997, said he was unable to give any profit guidance for the year to the end of March 2005 because the outlook 
remained so uncertain.
The most difficult markets were the UK regions and Germany, where many new carriers have entered the arena 
and EasyJet is expanding rapidly.
He said many new entrants were "losing money on a heroic scale. Most will not survive more than 18 to 24 
months." Ryanair would not be leading any consolidation efforts.
Ryanair's yields, or average fare levels, could fall by between 5 per cent and 20 per cent this year following a 15 per 
cent drop in the 12 months to the end of March, he said.
With a 20 per cent decline in yields, Ryanair, for long the most profitable airline in Europe, would only break even, 
warned Mr O'Leary. However, a 5 per cent decline in yields - which is built into the group's long-term business 
model - would see Ryanair's net profits rise this year by 15 per cent to 20 per cent.
The group is due to report its results for last year on June 1. Mr O'Leary said these would be in line with current 
guidance for a fall in net profits by 10 per cent, the first decline in 15 years, to about Euros 215m (Pounds 143m) 
from Euros 239.4m a year ago.
Until February, Ryanair had been forecasting a 10 per cent rise in net profits. It was caught out by the 25 per cent to 
30 per cent fall in yields in the last quarter from January to March, as it was forced to discount heavily to fill empty 
seats resulting from an over-ambitious expansion of capacity. It is now aiming to slow its growth from next month.
O'Leary forecasts an 'awful' winter for European airlines
The group could report a quarterly loss for the fourth quarter - its first since flotation - and yesterday it announced 
another 800,000 flights up to the end of June where passengers pay only airport charges and taxes.
The airline has been punished by investors for its fall from grace. It has been the second worst performer in the 
FTSE Eurotop 300 index this year. Ryanair's share price, which fell from a high of Euros 7.59 in January to a low of 
Euros 4.27 in March, dipped 13 cents yesterday to Euros 4.93. Observer, Page 20

More grandiose claims from garrulous Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary. The Irish low-budget airline is giving away 
80,000 tickets to celebrate carrying its 80 millionth passenger.
O'Leary claimed it had saved people Euros 80bn on prices charged by other airlines. When told that Euros 1,000 
per passenger seemed a little high, he corrected it to Euros 8bn. With such sloppy counting, no wonder Ryanair has 
just issued a profits warning. observer@ft.com

Michael O'Leary, the 42-year-old chief executive of Ryanair, has come to personify the brash new Irish business 
elite. An accountant by training, he has none of the grey attributes of that profession.
But his head for numbers, a shrewd marketing brain and a ruthless competitive streak has helped turn Ryanair into 
Europe's leading low-cost airline.
The sector has attracted its fair share of extroverts. But Mr O'Leary more than most has cultivated the image of a 
business rebel fighting the airline establishment.
Take his views on travel agents: "Screw the travel agent. Take the fuckers out and shoot them. What have they 
done for passengers over the years?"
Or his view on Ryanair customers who want their money back because a relative has fallen ill. "We don't fall over 
ourselves if they say: 'My granny fell ill'. What part of 'no refund' don't they understand? You are not getting a refund 
so fuck off."
His publicity-seeking sometimes seems ill-judged, as when the airline's millionth passenger sued the company after 
it reneged on a promise to give her free flights for life. He handled his recent dispute with the European 
Commission over illegal airport subsidies in the only way he knows how - attacking the members of the Commission 
as Soviet-era bureaucrats who are bad for business.
Mr O'Leary, who eschews suit and tie in favour of check shirts and jeans, projects himself as the common man's 
capitalist. He likes to play football with his pilots and has been known to help out baggage handlers at Dublin 
airport.
But for all this bonhomie, he has no time for unions - or government ministers - who get in his way. John Murray-

Ryanair, the Irish low-cost airline, is to launch its appeal against the European Commission early next month over 
the company's illegal state aid at Belgium's Charleroi airport.
Ryanair said that whatever the outcome of the appeal to the European Court of First Instance - which could take up 
two years - it might be able to avoid refunding any of the financial support received since it set up its first continental 
European base at Charleroi in 2001.
The suggestion, which would negate the effect of the Brussels ruling that part of the support was illegal state aid, 
emerged as the airline confirmed that it had struck a new deal with Charleroi.
This would leave net charges on existing routes at the level that first triggered the Commission's investigation more 
than two years ago. Ryanair said the agreement with Charleroi and its owner, the regional Walloon government, 
would allow it to continue to operate its 11 routes to and from Belgium at no extra cost.
Jim Callaghan, Ryanair regulatory affairs director, said the airline's existing net cost of Euros 5 (Pounds 3.30) per 
departing passenger would remain the same on the routes.
In effect, the new agreement will safeguard the Euros 4 per passenger marketing support on the 11 routes beyond 
the five-year limit imposed by the Commission. Ryanair's original deal with Charleroi, to which the Commission 
objected, stated that the support could last 15 years.
Under the new agreement, when the support ends after five years it will be compensated by an equivalent reduction 
in the service charge per departing passenger. The airport has agreed to reduce the previous Euros 7 per 
passenger charge to as little as Euros 1 to make up for the eventual removal of the marketing support when the 
five-year limit is reached and for a future rise in ground handling charges.
The Euros 1 per passenger charge will rise when the service is put to public tender, after the airport reaches the 
threshold of 2m passengers a year. The Walloon government will also legislate to make the discounted 
arrangements available to other airlines.
Ryanair set to appeal over illegal state aid in Belgium
Mr Callaghan said Ryanair was still waiting for the regional government to submit its calculations on the scale of 
any repayment.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the core of the group's appeal to the European Court would be that 
its original deal with Charleroi had passed the "private investor principle" because the airline had already negotiated 
even lower cost deals with privately owned airports. Lombard, Page 24

Passenger traffic through BAA's UK airports rose 4.4 per cent to a record 133.4m in the 12 months to March 31.
The pace of recovery from the impact of the Iraq war and severe acute respiratory syndrome in the early months of 
the financial year has accelerated and BAA said that March traffic had risen 10.4 per cent from the depressed level 
of a year ago to 10.8m passengers.
The recent improvement had been most marked on North Atlantic and other long-haul routes. During the year, the 
North Atlantic routes gradually recovered to show an increase of 0.3 per cent, while in March alone, North Atlantic 
travel was up 12.1 per cent, including a 16.6 per cent rise at London Heathrow.
The charter market remained weak as tour operators continued to lose ground to the low-cost carriers. European 
charter traffic for the last 12 months dropped 3.2 per cent and fell 9 per cent year-on-year in March. By contrast, 
European scheduled traffic rose 8.4 per cent for the year to March 31 and 12.6 per cent in March alone.
The performance of BAA's seven UK airports continued to be affected by their relative exposure to the low-cost 
airline sector, with London Stansted achieving a 15.9 per cent rise in the 12 months to 19.4m, led by the growth of 
Ryanair and EasyJet.
BAA expects to make a detailed planning application next year to build a second runway at Stansted, to be opened 
in 2012. The expansion is aimed at raising capacity to 80m passengers a year. The first phase is estimated to cost 
Pounds 2bn. Passenger volumes at Heathrow rose by 2.1 per cent in the last 12 months to 64.3m, while aircraft 
movements fell marginally to 461,000.
BAA's three Scottish airports - Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen - increased passenger volumes last year by 4 
per cent to 18.3m.

The deal announced yesterday by Ryanair with Brussels Charleroi airport seems to be a distinct positive for the 
budget airline, allowing it to continue for at least the near-term with its low existing airport and handling charges. 
The agreement has yet to be approved by the European Commission, which in February outlawed some of the 
subsidies Ryanair was receiving from the Walloon government. 
But the pact has presumably been drawn up with EU approval in mind.
The downside is that the same discounted arrangements will be offered to other airlines without Ryanair's 
negotiating muscle. Nor is it clear what will happen when Ryanair's passenger numbers through Charleroi grow 
from 1.8m to more than 2m, triggering a renegotiation of charges.
Still, this should restore some faith in the Ryanair model. It was a combination of problems at Charleroi and a profits 
warning that sent the shares tumbling in February. This should improve sentiment ahead of the impending full-year 
results.

 (ANSA) - Treviso, April 13 - Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair will operate from May 4 to 30, 2004 flights between 
Treviso, northern Italy, and London, Barcelona, Frankfurt or Brussels, at the cost of 2. 0 euro ($ 2. 4), sales 
manager Peter Sherrard said.
 Ryanair will launch the special low-cost flights in order to mark two million passengers transported in Treviso since 
1998, when the company launched the flight between Treviso and London.
Since 1998, the number of passengers transported annually in Treviso rose to 600, 000 from 80, 000. At present 
Ryanair operates 14 daily flights from and to Treviso.
 Ryanair served some 23 million passengers around the world in 2003, some five million of them were Italians, 
compared to two million passengers in 1995. The company, which currently operates 120 daily flights in Italy, 
expects the number of transported passengers on international airports to reach 7. 5 million by the end of 2004.
 Ryanair registered a turnover of over 1. 0 bln euro ($ 1. 207 bln) and a net profit of 210 mln euro ($ 253. 5 mln) for 
2003, according to preliminary results. (ANSA).

Brussels in new Ryanair probe

The European Commission is to investigate a deal struck between Ryanair and the Walloon government to keep 
the Irish low-cost carrier flying to South Brussels Charleroi airport.
The Walloon government said on Friday that it had reached an agreement with Ryanair over subsidies under which 
the fees levied on the carrier would remain unchanged.
By adjusting local taxes for all the carriers arriving at Charleroi, Ryanair will pay no more than the Euros 5 a 
passenger it is already charged for its 11 routes into the airport.
However, the deal will have to be renegotiated once Charleroi starts to handle more than 2m passengers a year, 
because the Commission has ruled that beyond that point existing subsidies must end. Last year, 1.8m passengers 
flew via Charleroi.
It also comes too late to reverse the decision to cut Ryanair's service from London's Stansted airport to Charleroi, 
which will happen at the end of this month. The route served 150,000 passengers last year. The Walloon 
government has suspended plans for a Dollars 100m (Pounds 54m) airport terminal capable of handling 4m 
passengers a year because of uncertainty over new rules on airport subsidies to be drafted by the Commission.
In February, the Commission outlawed some of the subsidies Ryanair was receiving from the Walloon government 
and ordered the airline to repay up to Euros 4.5m (Pounds 3m). Wallonia and Ryanair hope to meet the 
Commission's desire for fairness by cutting the passenger tax from Euros 7 to Euros 1 and raising the handling tax 
from Euros 1 to Euros 3 for each person arriving at Charleroi. The landing tax will be frozen at Euros 1 a passenger. 
Ryanair will lose a subsidy that had, in effect, reduced its cost to Euros 5 for each passenger.
A Commission spokesman said the Belgian government had yet to present a plan to implement the February ruling. 
"If Friday's discussions fall within that framework, it will have to be notified and investigated by the Commission," he 
said, emphasising the Commission had not seen a copy of the agreement.
Brussels in new Ryanair probe
Ryanair, which is due to make a statement about Friday's deal tomorrow, accounts for 90 per cent of the 
passengers at Charleroi, with the rest coming from French and Polish charter flights.
Later this year, the Commission will unveil new guidelines governing airport subsidies and all airline contracts.
Ryanair, which flies to more than 80 destinations in 14 European countries, has used subsidies from local 
authorities with under-utilised airports to keep down fares for its 24m passengers. The airline also reduces costs by 
minimising the time its aircraft spend on the ground. American owns up over data, Page 22

The going has been tough for the FTSE 100 lately, as London's leading index has found it hard to progress beyond 
the 4,500 mark.
There are many reasons for this. But the performance of the market during the first quarter does appear to bear out 
the active fund manager's mantra. In a market stuck in a narrow range, stock-picking skills can deliver superior 
returns.
A look at the top performers in the FTSE Eurotop 300 over the year so far shows nine British companies in the top 
25 and three in the bottom 25.
An investor who had bought Reuters - the top European performer - late last year would have seen a 72 per cent 
increase in the value of their holding. MMO, the third-best performer, has risen 31 per cent and Rolls Royce is up 
30 per cent.
At the bottom of the list is Ryanair, the Dublin-listed budget airline, which has lost 21 per cent. British Airways, on 
the other hand, is in the top 10 with a gain of 25 per cent.
Other poor performers include J Sainsbury and GlaxoSmithkline, which have both fallen about 12 per cent. Their 
respective rivals, Tesco and AstraZeneca, have not fared so badly, with the retailer down 3 per cent and 
pharmaceuticals company off nearly 2 per cent.
Shell Transport and Trading has dropped 11 per cent while BP has risen by more than 6 per cent.
There are, of course, many individual reasons for the performance of these companies.
Investors have also been looking for bargains and are buying shares that took a knock last year.
Fortune still favours the brave stock-picker DEBORAH HARGREAVES ON LONDON
A quarter's performance is not a good measure for longer term investors. But if financial markets are stuck in a 
narrow range, it is worth taking some time to spot companies that are undervalued.
Goldman Sachs has been extolling the virtues of stock-picking and suggests that some growth stocks are being 
overlooked.
The bank has picked several stocks based on criteria such as expected annual sales growth of 6 per cent or more 
for the next two years and an increase in earnings before interest and tax of more than 10 per cent.
The prospective price/earnings ratio must be 18 or below and return on equity must be greater than 10 per cent.
By this measure, Goldman has highlighted Aviva, the life insurer whose shares have risen this year, but the 
company remains on a p/e of 11. It also tips Kingfisher, the electrical retailer, which is on a p/e of 17, Royal Bank of 
Scotland on a p/e of 15.8 and Gus, the general retailer, with a p/e of 13.4.
Goldman has screened high-yielding stocks as well - those with a prospective yield of more than 3.5 per cent. As a 
way of checking the sustainability of the yield, the bank has picked shares with good dividend cover.
These include Lloyds TSB, which has an estimated yield of 8 per cent for this year, and Shell Transport and Trading 
with a forecast yield of 4 per cent.
Investors have long been wary of Lloyds' commitment to its dividend although the bank maintained its payout at the 
latest results announcement.
Shell has its own particular problems with an extensive internal review under way after dramatically downgrading its 
proved oil reserves and losing its chief executive. But I have mentioned before in this column that I think the 
company offers value at its current price.
Another company that appears to offer value, according to research from RSM International, the network of 
accountancy firms, is AWG, the UK water group. AWG is the highest rated British company in RSM's top 50 list of 
European "hidden gems."
The company has looked at cashflow growth per year since 2000 and included forecasts for this year and next.
It then calculates the price to cashflow ratio and combines the two measures to find companies that are not being 
rewarded for good cashflow growth. AWG has increased its cashflow by 23 per cent a year, but has a price to 
cashflow ratio of 2.6.
The utility has been buying back its shares, which has boosted cashflow per share, but it compares favourably with 
the European average (out of a total of 900 companies), which is a price to prospective cashflow of 9.4 and 
cashflow growth of 8.1 per cent a year.
Many of the companies that prove to be undervalued by RSM's screen are smaller operators.
For example, the other British companies in the 50 most undervalued, include Paladin Resources, the oil and gas 
group, Kingston Communications, the telecommunications services company, and Northgate, the van rental 
operator. deborah.hargreaves@ft.com

EasyJet fights for slots in Paris TRANSPORT:

EasyJet, the UK low-cost airline, is launching a campaign in France to counter the dominance of Air France and 
stimulate competition and lower air fares.
EasyJet is seeking to improve its access to take-off and landing slots in particular at Paris Orly airport and to lower 
landing and handling charges at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, the main Air France hub.
It has been building its presence in France, but has become frustrated by what it regards as the unfair advantages 
enjoyed by Air France within an aviation industry still dominated by state interests.
The Paris airports are state-owned and Air France is still 54 per cent state-owned, although next month's takeover 
of KLM, the Dutch flag carrier through an all-share offer, will lower the French state stake to 44 per cent.
Air France accounted for 53 per cent of slots at Orly and 74 per cent at Charles de Gaulle, the biggest share of any 
European airline at its capital city airports. British Airways holds just over 40 per cent of slots at London Heathrow.
EasyJet operates 55 French flights daily with four aircraft operating through Orly and three through Charles de 
Gaulle.
It has managed to expand its presence at Orly after winning a share of the additional take off and landing slots, 
which became available as a result of the bankruptcies of Aeris and Air Lib, the small French carriers, but at the 
same time it has seen Air France greatly increase its presence at Orly.
EasyJet said Air France was the only European flag carrier to have increased its domestic share from 1996 to 2003, 
and was considering legal action against the French government under European competition law.
EasyJet also said that the process for allocating take off and landing slots at Paris's airports had "only served to 
increase the dominance of Air France".
The UK airline also questioned the independence of Cohors, slot co-ordinator, one of whose founders was Air 
France.
EasyJet fights for slots in Paris TRANSPORT:
EasyJet is the second European low-cost airline to become embroiled in controversy in France, following Ryanair's 
battle over illegal state subsidies at Strasbourg airport in a case brought against it by Brit Air, a subsidiary of Air 
France.
Ray Webster, EasyJet chief executive, said French consumers were not getting a good deal and that France had 
fallen behind "almost every other country in terms of providing choice in the field of air travel".

 (ANSA) - Rome, April 8 - The decision of the European Commission (EC) to green light the alliance between Italy's 
flag carrier Alitalia and French carrier Air France on April 7, 2004 pushed the confidence in the alliance and the 
share prices up, it was reported on April 8, 2004.
 Alitalia is currently working on its new industrial plan that will enable the carrier to become part of the alliance 
between the French company and the Dutch flag carrier KLM and will lead to the creation of the largest European 
air carrier, Italy's EU Affairs Minister Rocco Buttiglione said.
The approval of the alliance must be considered as the beginning of Alitalia's revival, Infrastructure Deputy Minister 
Mario Tassone said. The decision of Brussels, however, will not lead to modifications of the agreement between the 
French and Italian carriers, which have already introduced their summer schedule.
 The green light by the EU will promote competition among the other carriers flying between Italy and France, 
including low-cost companies like the British EasyJet, Italian Volare and Meridiana, French Corsair and Irish 
Ryanair. In the same time Alitalia's and Air France's presence on the routes between the two countries will not be 
reduced. (ANSA).

EasyJet, the UK low-cost airline is expected to report a loss before exceptional charges and goodwill of Pounds 
25m for its first half to March.
The group generates the majority of its profit traditionally in its final quarter from July to September and current 
trading is following that pattern.
The first-half results, to be announced in early May, are expected to show little change from the loss before 
exceptionals and goodwill of Pounds 24.4m in the same period last year.
The growing pressures on the financial performance of the low-cost carriers in Europe will be underlined when Irish 
carrier, Ryanair, reports its results for the last quarter of its financial year from January to March at the end of May.
It is expected to report, at best, break-even for the three months, although some analysts are forecasting that the 
airline will report its first quarterly loss since it was floated seven years ago. Ryanair has been punished by 
investors since it shocked the market at the end of January by issuing its first profit warning since flotation.
The shares plunged from a 12-month high of Euros 7.59 in January to a recent low of Euros 4.27 two weeks ago. It 
closed last night 6 cents higher at Euros 4.64.
Davy, part of the Bank of Ireland group and stockbroker to Ryanair, is forecasting that it could announce a net loss 
of Euros 10m (Pounds 6.97m) for the latest three months.
The two leading European low-cost carriers are at different points in their efforts to moderate their rapid growth in 
capacity.
EasyJet is already reaping the benefits of steadier growth while Ryanair's capacity growth will only begin to slow 
from May.
EasyJet expects little change for first half
EasyJet has announced that its capacity grew by only 15 per cent year-on-year during the winter, resulting in first-
half fares that were slightly higher than last year's. By contrast, Ryanair has forecast a fall in yields or average fare 
levels of more than 25 per cent in its final quarter as it struggled to cope with a jump in capacity of 50 per cent.
JP Morgan is still forecasting a rise of more than 20 per cent in EasyJet earnings for the full year.
EasyJet capacity is set to expand by 25 per cent year-on-year in its second half from April to September.
EasyJet shares closed unchanged last night at 307p.

On May 1 the European Union (EU) will welcome 10 new member states in the largest enlargement in its more than 
50 year history. The accession of Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, 
the Slovak Republic and Slovenia have a profound impact on the European aviation industry.
While it may prove to be the industry's biggest challenge to date, the 10 mostly eastern European countries joining 
the EU will equally provide manufacturers, operators and lenders with unrivalled opportunities. With more than 130 
carriers and a network of over 450 airports, the enlarged EU will not only open up new markets for the operators, 
but also with many operators within the accession countries still flying outdated Soviet-era equipment, it should also 
boost demand for new aircraft.
When the new members join the EU, the law contained in the EU Treaties will become an integral part of the 
national laws of the new member states. For the aviation sector this will mean that the new member states will be 
governed by EU legislation and no longer by bilateral agreements dealing with the issues covered by that 
legislation. For the airlines of the new member states, this will also mean full exposure to the Third Package, 
unrestricted competition, limitations on state aid, air service agreements on a collective European basis and 
inclusion within The Single European Sky. While initially this may prove to be a testing period for some airlines, a 
larger market can only benefit carriers of both existing member states and accession countries in the longer term.
So what are the regulations and restrictions that the new operators will be subject to on joining the EU?
An end to state aid
Opening up Europe: as Ryanair has discovered, the European Union (EU) is watching airlines closely. So 
airlines in the 10 accession countries should pay close a....
Although not just restricted to the aviation industry, some of the most high-profile state-aid cases recently have 
concerned airlines, including Alitalia, Aer Lingus, Olympic Airways and Ryanair. Furthermore, the issue is likely to 
gain even greater prominence on enlargement. The European Commission (EC) officials anticipate a 40% increase 
in the state-aid workload as a result of EU enlargement.
The accession will bring into the EU many state-owned airlines which are accustomed to receiving support or 
subsidies from their governments. Once within the EU, these airlines will be subject to the general prohibition that is 
placed on member states on giving aid that would distort competition. In this regard, to avoid being classified as 
state aid, any support offered by member states will have to satisfy the "market economy investor principle"--in 
other words, the terms on which the aid was offered by the state to the airline would have been acceptable to a 
private investor operating under the constraints of the market.
Alternatively, the support measure would need to be notified to and approved by the EC. It is the role of the EC to 
investigate whether the measure has been made on bona fide commercial terms and is in its nature something that 
would be available in the open market. The whole amount is regarded as state aid if it transpires that the financial 
support would not have been available from a commercial entity. With such stringent restrictions, the need for flag 
carriers to go into the market to seek private funding is inevitable, which should provide valuable business for the 
banks.
However, it should be noted that while generally the prohibition is inflexible, there are some limited circumstances 
where aid is permitted, and it is to these exceptions that the new accession countries will no doubt look.
For example, in many cases an exemption to the prohibition on state aid has been granted where it has been 
shown that the aid would result in the promotion of certain economic activities. This has allowed several carriers to 
receive state aid as part of a restructuring programme. However, such exemptions are only permitted within strict 
guidelines for example, the restructuring programme must be capable of restoring the airline's health so that it can, 
within a reasonable period, be expected to operate viably, normally without further aid or the aid should not enable 
the airline to engage in anti-competitive activities, nor be detrimental to the implementation of the EU liberalization 
rules in the air transport sector. Under such circumstances, the EC is only likely to allow restructuring aid in 
exceptional cases and under very stringent conditions. The carriers which will therefore he able to rely on 
governmental help will be few and far between.
Another recent development which may have an impact on aviation within the EU is the ruling by the EC that certain 
incentives received by Ryanair at its Belgian hub of Charleroi from the regional authorities were illegal. Although 
some of the incentives were permissible as part of regional development support for the airport, the airline has still 
been ordered to repay about 3 million [pounds sterling] ($5.4 million) of the subsidies. As the ruling was issued as 
Airfinance Journal went to press, it is too early fully to digest its implications. Nevertheless, smaller airports--which 
are often government-owned--have in the past been able to use these incentives (such as reductions in landing 
fees) to their considerable advantage in generating extra traffic.
These incentives have undeniably been very successful in attracting a large number of passengers to what 
werepreviously underused airports, providing an economic boost not only to the airports but also to the surrounding 
regions. For example, the presence of Ryanair at Charleroi is estimated to have boosted the Walloon economy by 
about 30 million [pounds sterling] a year. If the low-cost carriers withdraw from these regions the implications for 
regional development within the EU may extend well beyond those of the specific case of Charleroi.
Increased competition
On May 1 the new competition law enforcement procedures will come into force. With the adoption of Regulation 
1/2003, replacing Regulation 17/62, the EU has sought to modernize the way in which Articles 81 and 82 are 
implemented. By doing so, the EU took a major step towards adapting the 40-year old antitrust procedural rules to 
the demands of a Union of 25 member states.
Opening up Europe: as Ryanair has discovered, the European Union (EU) is watching airlines closely. So 
airlines in the 10 accession countries should pay close a....
Although numerous articles could be written about the changes, the main difference will be that it will no longer be 
possible for parties to file restrictive agreements with the EC in view of obtaining an individual exemption. 
Consequently immunity from fines pending the EC decision will no longer be available. Instead, parties will have to 
make their own assessment of whether their intended agreement fulfills the conditions in Article 81(3) of the Treaty. 
This will prove to be a particularly tricky task in respect of cooperation agreements such as airline alliances. As 
such, a certain degree of legal uncertainty is inevitable.
A key aspect of the reforms is to intensify cooperation between the EC and national competition authorities. In the 
area of aviation, this will involve a specialized working group exclusively dedicated to the air transport sector, 
mirroring what is already done for railways. This should ensure that the competition rules are applied consistently 
by member states.
Third Package
The Third Package is founded on three pillars that liberalize the licensing of carriers, the routes they can fly and the 
prices they can impose. On accession, the new member states will benefit from the full effect of this in the same 
way as the existing 15 member states do.
Licensing of air carriers: Council Regulation 2407/92. This provides that member states shall permit any EU carrier 
holding an operating licence granted pursuant to the regulation to exercise traffic rights within the EU.
Market access: Council Regulation 2408/92 on access for community air carriers to intra-community air routes. 
Under this regulation, access to routes between member states is unrestricted. Most importantly any airline holding 
a valid air operators' certificate in the EU cannot be prevented from operating on any route within the EU, including 
flights wholly within another country. On accession, the new member states will therefore for the first time have all 
the "air freedoms", including unrestricted access to cabotage routes (but, most importantly, subject to the availability 
of slots).
Fares and rates for air services: Council Regulation 2409/92. The basic effect of this regulation is freedom for EU 
carriers to set fares for scheduled, charter and cargo services.
Indeed, fares and rates for charter services (passengers and cargo) are not subject to any controls under the 
regulation. They are simply to be agreed freely between the contracting parties.
Open skies and the Single European Sky
Following a ruling from the European Court of Justice and the mandates given by the European Council to the 
commission, the EC is to negotiate on behalf of all member states the full range of aviation trade rules including, 
capacity, fares, frequency, routes, slot allocation, and airline security. It will be the new accession countries that are 
likely to benefit the most from this outcome. Individual European states have fewer airports and lower volumes of air 
traffic than larger nations such as the US. As a consequence, it is usual for that country to have fewer airports and 
lower volumes of air traffic, which in turn means a weaker bargaining position compared to that of a larger country. 
It is only through banding together that European states can most effectively optimize their shared potentials and 
the larger the number of states, the stronger the bargaining position will be.
With 10 new member states joining the EU there has never been a greater need to reform the outdated architecture 
of European air traffic control. While there has been a constant increase in air traffic control capacity in Europe 
since 1990, it is trailing behind the growth in air traffic.
The technical improvements made by Eurocontrol, the international organization for the safety of air navigation, 
have not been sufficient to reverse the trend and delays continue, costing airlines between 1.3 billion [euro] ($1.5 
billion) and 1.9 billion [euro] a year. With many of these delays occurring in central European countries, the very 
recent package of regulations (February 2, 2004) aimed at introducing common rules on the use of airspace 
throughout the EU are to be greatly welcomed.
Opening up Europe: as Ryanair has discovered, the European Union (EU) is watching airlines closely. So 
airlines in the 10 accession countries should pay close a....
The four new regulations when fully implemented will provide a wide ranging package including: the establishment 
of the Single Sky Committee ensuring the interests of all categories of airspace users are considered rules 
establishing common requirements for the safe and efficient provision of air navigation services the organization 
and use of airspace and interoperability within the European air transport management network.
Undoubtedly it will be the interoperability regulation that is likely to impact heaviest on the new member states as it 
aims to achieve harmonization between the different systems and associated procedures of the European air traffic 
management network. While the initiative may prove to be very ambitious, its application to all the member states, 
old and new, should provide a sound basis from which the issue of air delays and airspace congestion can be 
tackled.
The accession of the new member states to the EU could not come at a better time for the aviation industry. Hit by 
recession and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US, enlargement is likely to help the industry emerge from its 
worst downturn in years, providing not only new markets for carriers but also a stimulus for the manufacturers.
The coming months and years will certainly be challenging and not all carriers are likely to survive the rigours of a 
competitive market. Yet for those who do, the rewards should be substantial.

Price war drags Virgin Express into red

Virgin Express, the Brussels-based airline controlled by Sir Richard Branson, moved sharply into loss last year as it 
fell victim to an aggressive price war in the Belgian market.
The airline reported a pre-tax loss of Euros 19m (Pounds 12.7m) in 2003 compared with a profit of Euros 45,000 
the previous year.
The announcement of the sharp reverse after two years of marginal profitability came after Virgin Express 
confirmed two weeks ago that it had tentatively agreed to be taken over by rival SN Brussels Airlines. The deal 
should be completed by September.
The airlines, which both operate from Brussels' main Zaventem airport, have been aggressively competing with 
each other as well as the full-service airlines from around Europe.
The price war has been further intensified by the presence of Ryanair, the low-cost airline whose main European 
hub is at nearby Charleroi airport. Europe's biggest no-frills carrier had been expanding its base in Belgium rapidly 
until a ruling this year that it had received illegal subsidies from the Walloon government, which owns Charleroi.
Virgin Express said yields fell by 21 per cent in 2003 while it managed to cut costs by only 11 per cent.
David Hoare, chairman, blamed the losses on the impact of the invasion of Iraq and a price war due to 
"unprecedented price discounting by network operators in order to fill excess capacity".
Along with Ryanair, he singled out Alitalia, the struggling state-owned Italian carrier, which he claimed had been 
pricing below Virgin Express's costs all year on routes to Milan and Rome.
He said Virgin Express's average unit cost was "significantly below" those of full service airlines such as Alitalia.
"We will be interested to hear the EC's view of this airline's activities," he said. There were signs of improvement in 
yields in March and in forward bookings for April.
Price war drags Virgin Express into red
Virgin Express also revealed that it would have to restate its accounts between 1999 and 2001 to reflect the loss of 
Euros 7.4m in revenue it had failed to collect because of a glitch in its reservation system software, which had now 
been upgraded.

Imagine you are in a supermarket and are just about to drop an item you have selected from the shelves into your 
shopping basket. Someone who looks like a store employee steps forward and asks you how how much the item 
costs. Would you know?
If you doubt that you would, you are not alone. A study led by Peter Dickson of Florida International University and 
Alan Sawyer of the University of Florida found that fewer than half of customers knew the price of the article they 
had just selected when they were asked by researchers posing as store stock-takers. Most shoppers under-
estimated the prices of their products. As many as 20 per cent did not even have the confidence to venture a guess.
Some commentators believe the increasing range of goods on offer, and the rise of cut-price retailers such as Wal-
Mart, have made consumers more price conscious than ever.
The internet, which has made quick price comparisons even easier, has added to the view that consumers these 
days will not overpay. But the Florida study, cited in an article in the September 2003 edition of the Harvard 
Business Review, indicates that consumer attitudes to price remain as complicated as ever.
Take the trade-off between price and quality. Some who were previously high spenders are no longer prepared to 
pay large sums for certain goods and services. This is true, for example, of short airline trips. The low-cost airlines, 
such as Southwest in the US and Ryanair and EasyJet in Europe, attract business travellers who would previously 
have flown on one of the more expensive carriers. Even when people continue to invest in top-of-the-range 
products, such as cars, they often shop around for the best price.
But what about luxury goods such as jewellery? The authors of the Harvard Business Review article Eric Anderson, 
a visiting assistant professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management and Duncan Simester, an 
associate professor at MIT Sloan School of Management found that jewellery buyers did not necessarily like low 
prices. "Customers often interpret discounts as a signal of weak demand, which may raise doubts about quality," 
they say.
The psychology of consumption PRICE AND QUALITY: The more people pay for something the more they use 
it. Michael Skapinker on customer loyalty
The researchers conducted a study with a company that sells high-quality gifts and jewellery. The company was 
considering allowing customers to pay for its products in instalments, without incurring financing charges. Evidence 
from other retailing sectors suggested this would increase sales.
To test whether the same would happen to its sales, the company sent 1,000 of its customers a catalogue 
containing the interest-free instalments offer. They sent another 1,000 customers catalogues without the instalment 
offer. Which customers ordered more jewellery? The ones who did not receive the instalment offer. The customers 
who were asked to pay cash, in full, ordered 13 per cent more jewellery. Why? One customer told the researchers 
that offering the instalment plan made the jewellery company look "tacky".
Where else would companies not be advised to cut prices? The Harvard Business Review writers cite laser eye 
surgery as an example of a service where it would be unwise to advertise discount sales. One eye surgeon said: 
"Good medicine never goes on sale."
They add that a speciality women's clothing store in Atlanta offered similar reasons for not using "sale" signs to 
promote new items. She feared customers would see clothes with "sale" signs on them either as leftovers from 
previous seasons or as new designs that other customers had decided were not for them.
So while some luxury products and services, such as air travel and cars, are susceptible to price competition, 
others are not. But persuading customers to part with their cash is not the end of the affair; companies should make 
sure they make use of their purchases too.
Why? Surely it is enough for sellers to get their hands on the money, preferably in full and upfront? Not always. 
Persuading customers to consume what they have bought is often the key to persuading them to make repeat 
purchases and to recommend the goods or services to their friends.
This was the central argument of an earlier Harvard Business Review article, "Pricing and the Psychology of 
Consumption", by John Gourville of Harvard Business School and Dilip Soman of the Hong Kong University of 
Science and Technology's business school. In the article, published in September 2002, the authors argue that 
people who fail to make use of their purchases are often short-term customers.
Most magazines, they say, achieve renewal rates of only 60 per cent, or less. Only half of health club members 
renew their subscriptions each year. It is not just that it is cheaper to hang on to existing customers than going 
hunting for new ones. Companies can also persuade existing customers to buy upgrades. "In the software 
business, for example, companies often make more money selling upgrades than selling the initial application," the 
writers say.
How can companies persuade existing customers to stay on? Experiments have repeatedly established that the 
more people pay for something, the more likely they are to use it. So, someone who has paid Dollars 500 for a 
skiing holiday is less likely to cancel it if they fall ill than someone who has paid Dollars 100.
When someone pays, say, Dollars 600 for a yearly health club membership, they will certainly go to the gym for the 
first few weeks. But after that, their attendance often tails off.
By the time their membership comes up for renewal, that Dollars 600 is a distant memory. In cases such as these, 
encouraging members to pay Dollars 50 a month may make them more likely to become long-term customers. 
Each month that they pay will make them more likely to keep coming in renewing their membership at the end of 
the year.
While instalment plans might not work for jewellery buyers, it can be a useful way of hanging on to purchasers of 
other relatively expensive services.

If any of Europe's regional airlines still thought that they could safely ignore the onslaught of low-cost carriers, then 
they had a rude awakening last week at the European Regions Airline Association (ERA) conference. The evidence 
presented by industry experts and senior executives made it clear that change was not an option, it was an 
imperative.
But in truth, they were being told what they already knew: the old regional airline model is broken and it is time for 
sweeping changes. As the attendees mused over the rise and rise of the low-cost carriers and what the regionals 
were doing, or had to do, to ensure survival, the question emerged: "What is a regional airline?"
Consultant Professor Rigas Doganis proffered that Ryanair was a "regional airline" as it was serving the same 
markets as many of Europe's regionals. With traditional regional airlines already having to adopt much of the low-
cost carrier format to remain competitive, the mountain is truly being dragged to Mohammed.
Some observers might suggest that it is the types of aircraft operated that define a regional. Where Ryanair has a 
189-seat Boeing 737-800, a regional airline will be operating a turboprop or regional jet. Case closed.
Don't tell Flybe. Its entire fleet comprises turboprops and regional jets, but it has spent the last two years morphing 
into what it calls a "regional low-fare carrier". As if to underline its reinvention, this long-standing ERA member has 
just left the association and joined the newly created European Low Fares Airlines Association (ELFAA).
ERA director general Mike Ambrose, who questions the need for the ELFAA in the first place, says he suspects 
Flybe made the switch because it wanted to be seen as more of a low-fare airline. But is Flybe the first of many to 
decide that a change of image is a vital part of the survival game?
Sink or swim; Europe's regional airlines must change the way they do business or risk losing out to the ever-
growing low-fare sector
Despite the Flybe blow, the ERA is confident that it still has a strong future, having recently added two new 
members, and with more expected to come from the 10 new European Union members. But it is yet to 
wholeheartedly commit to working with ELFAA. The depth and breadth of the ERA organisation's experience 
arguably makes it much better equipped to tackle ongoing issues such as the passenger rights bill than the new 
organisation. But it is vital for both sides to work together rather than in isolation if they are to maximise their 
effectiveness.
If conventional regional airlines have a future, then it is as feeders into the hubs of the network carriers. But, as 
already been seen in the USA, they will still have to reinvent themselves. As highlighted by Lufthansa Regional's 
efforts, the regional airlines will have to become efficient, seat-production machines offering considerably lower 
costs of production than the network carriers they are feeding. If they cannot achieve this, the network carriers will 
replace them with their own low-cost operation.
There is only so much cost reduction that can be achieved by synergies and economies of scale. The thorny issue 
of staff productivity will have to be tackled with all the union hullabaloo that accompanies it. But as last week's 
Scandinavian Airlines union deal proves, breakthroughs are now achievable as employees accept that short-term 
pain for long-term survival is the only viable option.
It is no coincidence that the low-fare revolution has come hand-in-hand with the mass availability of the internet. 
And the low-cost carriers' already simple fare structures transferred easily to the internet.
But it wasn't so straightforward for the rest. British Airways chief executive Rod Eddington famously once said that a 
"second degree in physics" was needed to use the old BA booking website, adding that he actually has such a 
degree and still couldn't use it. Since then the airline has radically redesigned its website, and simplified its fares 
structure.
To compete with the low-cost carriers and attract e-enabled passengers, everyone is having to follow suit, and must 
keep the fare simplification effort going.
The internet accounts for 90% of Flybe's ticket sales, compared with less than 10% two years ago, generating huge 
cost savings. But the benefit is not only to the airline; for the first time, travellers can access all the fares from all the 
airlines, ensuring they get the lowest possible price.
There is little prospect of the high-earning regional airlines of yesteryear existing in the future, and there are few 
hiding places left. The message is simple: change, or when search and rescue arrives it will be too late.

Ryanair is finalising its appeal against the European Commission's state aid ruling and will join fellow no-frills 
airlines to contest other passenger compensation laws.
The Dublin-based carrier last week received a copy of the full EC judgement on illegal local government subsidies 
given by Brussels Charleroi airport to attract air services and it plans to lodge its formal appeal by the end of May. 
Jim Callaghan, Ryanair head of regulatory affairs, says the cornerstone of its appeal will be the Commission's 
application of the market economy investor principle (MEIP) in declaring a quarter of the subsidies Charleroi gave to 
Ryanair to be illegal. The essence of the MEIP is that, under European Union competition rules, when a public 
authority invests in an enterprise under conditions that would be acceptable to a private investor, the investment is 
not a state aid. Callaghan says the EC failed to take this principle into account when looking at Charleroi, which 
reported a small operating profit last year. "The EC has to ensure that public airports be allowed to compete with 
their private counterparts on a level footing," says Callaghan.
The airline is simultaneously leading the European Low Fares Airlines Association (ELFAA) in lodging its 
complaints on the recently passed denied boarding rules to the Court of First Instance in April. ELFAA is basing its 
appeal on two points: the absence of any link in compensation levels to the fare paid; and the failure to take third- 
party delays into account. Callaghan says if this early appeal fails to reverse the legislation, Ryanair predicts law 
suits "from every disgruntled passenger", which would have to be challenged on a one-by-one basis until case law 
proves the regulations unworkable.
Meanwhile, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is considering a legal challenge to the denied 
boarding compensation rules. "This is not a piece of legislation we can live with...We are looking for the most 
appropriate venue for a challenge," says IATA.

Industry experts are warning that Europe's regional airlines face possible extinction unless they quickly restructure 
to counter the onslaught of low-cost carriers.
Addressing senior executives from regional airlines at last week's European Regions Airline Association (ERA) 
conference in Barcelona, highly regarded industry consultant Professor Rigas Doganis said that low-cost carriers 
have undermined conventional short-haul markets, and questioned whether they were in fact the new regional 
airlines. "Should Ryanair be a member of ERA? It's a 'new regional', effectively doing what you are doing," he said.
Doganis added that despite efforts by the full-service carriers to reduce fares to compete with low-cost carriers 
"they haven't cut costs so losses are going to continue on European routes". He questions why full-service carriers 
have not adopted more of the low-cost carrier strategies such as higher density seating, shorter turnarounds and 
higher aircraft utilisation.
Doganis believes it may already be too late to stop the low-cost carriers, and predicts that, in future, most of the 
intra-Europe short-haul market will be dominated by "two or three major, low-cost, no-frills operators who will 
squeeze out new, smaller entrants".
"Perhaps the regionals will be the losers," says Doganis, asking: "Are they an endangered species?"
Doganis does see a niche role in the future for traditional regional airlines providing feed for "three-to-five network 
dominators" focusing on longer-haul operations.
KLM Cityhopper managing director Elfrieke van Galen is confident that there will be a place for regional airlines in 
the future, but not without pain. "Regionals will continue to operate as hub-feeders, but have to lower costs both in 
flight and on the ground," she says.
Europe's regionals feel low-fare heat; Expert asks: "Are they an endangered species?"
Lufthansa's regional operations have had to bear the brunt of the recent onslaught of low-fare carriers in the 
German market. Although the majority of Lufthansa Regional's business is hub-feeding, around 35% of operations 
are point-to-point. "The regional concept cannot compete with no-frills carriers in this market," says Lufthansa 
Regional senior vice-president Werner Knorr.
Airline consultant and former Scandinavian Airlines chief operating officer Kjell Fredheim thinks Europe's 
established carriers already have the armoury to tackle the low-cost carriers, but need to deploy it. "They have an 
advantage with slots when they get their act together and start to compete," he says.

History Founded as Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) as the flag carrier for Norway, Sweden and Denmark. 
Ownership of the airline was divided between SAS Danmark (28.6%), SAS Norge (28.6%) and SAS Sweden 
(42.8%), all owned 50% by private investors and 50% by their respective governments. SAS gradually acquired 
control of the domestic markets in all three countries by acquiring partial or full control in several local airlines. In 
May 1997 SAS formed the global Star Alliance network with Air Canada, Lufthansa, Thai and United Airlines. The 
ownership structure of SAS was changed in June 2001, with a holding company (SAS AB) being created in which 
the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark hold 21.4%, 14.3% and 14.3% respectively, and the remaining 
50% is publicly held and traded on the stock exchange.

Ryanair is finalising its appeal against the European Commission's state aid ruling and will join fellow no-frills 
airlines to contest other passenger compensation laws.
The Dublin-based carrier last week received a copy of the full EC judgement on illegal local government subsidies 
given by Brussels Charleroi airport to attract air services and it plans to lodge its formal appeal by the end of May. 
Jim Callaghan, Ryanair head of regulatory affairs, says the cornerstone of its appeal will be the Commission's 
application of the market economy investor principle (MEIP) in declaring a quarter of the subsidies Charleroi gave to 
Ryanair to be illegal. The essence of the MEIP is that, under European Union competition rules, when a public 
authority invests in an enterprise under conditions that would be acceptable to a private investor, the investment is 
not a state aid. Callaghan says the EC failed to take this principle into account when looking at Charleroi, which 
reported a small operating profit last year. "The EC has to ensure that public airports be allowed to compete with 
their private counterparts on a level footing," says Callaghan.
The airline is simultaneously leading the European Low Fares Airlines Association (ELFAA) in lodging its 
complaints on the recently passed denied boarding rules to the Court of First Instance in April. ELFAA is basing its 
appeal on two points: the absence of any link in compensation levels to the fare paid and the failure to take third- 
party delays into account. Callaghan says if this early appeal fails to reverse the legislation, Ryanair predicts law 
suits "from every disgruntled passenger", which would have to be challenged on a one-by-one basis until case law 
proves the regulations unworkable.
Meanwhile, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is considering a legal challenge to the denied 
boarding compensation rules. "This is not a piece of legislation we can live with...We are looking for the most 
appropriate venue for a challenge,"says IATA.Copyright 2004 Reed Business Information LimitedCopyright 2004

2nd: Heinrich von Pierer
Defying the trend for single-focus companies, the head of Siemens since 1992 has kept the German electrical 
goods company a diverse conglomerate, with a broad portfolio that has insulated it from the technology downturn. 
He also broke with tradition by expanding aggressively into the US.
3rd: Michael O'Leary
The chief executive of Ryanair, pioneer of the new breed of no- frills airlines, has a simple, pile 'em high and sell 
'em cheap philosophy. He became chief executive in 1994, floated Ryanair on the stock market in 1997, and says 
he aims to make it the largest short-haul carrier in Europe by 2010.
4th: Christopher Gent
The head of Vodafone from 1997 to 2003 was the chief architect behind its transformation into one of the world's 
largest mobile phone operators. His innovative pricing and marketing, plus ambitious acquisitions, meant the 
company weathered the dotcom fall-out better than most.
5th: Hasso Plattner
Plattner, the supervisory board chairman, co-founder and, until last year, co-CEO of e-business software solutions 
company SAP, led a European charge on the US applications software market with his company's revolutionary R/3 
client/server-based enterprise software.
6th: Jorma Ollila
Since taking charge at Nokia 12 years ago, Ollila has transformed it from a struggling industrial conglomerate into 
the leading manufacturer of mobile phones. By dominating a fast-growing market, he has created one of the largest 
companies in Europe.
7th: Hans-Jorg Rudloff
Runners Up - Most Influential Business Figure
A key architect of the eurobond markets, Rudloff is the former chairman of investment bank Credit Suisse First 
Boston which, under his stewardship, dominated those markets. He spotted the potential of the former Communist 
states in the early 1990s and took CSFB into Russia.

Pope John Paul II is the winner of the Financial Times poll to find the most influential European of the past quarter 
of a century. The collapse of communism was undoubtedly the defining event of the period, and readers of the FT 
and FT.com reflected that in their votes. The online poll, launched at the start of January, seemed an appropriate 
way to mark the 25th anniversary of the FT's international expansion.
The Pope made arguably the biggest single contribution to the largely peaceful overthrow of communism. Mikhail 
Gorbachev, who came second, also has a powerful claim to recognition as the man who presided over the 
revolution that ended the cold war. Third was Margaret Thatcher, who embodied the rolling-back of socialism and 
communism after a century in which many assumed political change could only move towards collectivism.
There were strong showings for Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former Norwegian prime minister who chaired the 
World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987, and for former German chancellor Helmut Kohl, who 
drove through German reunification. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the world wide web, and former European 
Commission president Jacques Delors, who reinvigorated European integration in the late 1980s and early 1990s, 
also did well.
A separate poll to find the most influential European business leader of the past 25 years was won by Daniel 
Vasella, who has run pharmaceutical company Novartis since its foundation in 1996. Heinrich von Pierer, chief 
executive of Siemens, came second. Third was Michael O'Leary, who has spawned a revolution in air travel as 
chief executive of Ryanair.
Readers had 25 candidates to choose from in each category. But selecting the shortlist was by far the most 
controversial part of the exercise. FT editorial staff made nominations, with the final lists chosen at a meeting of 
senior editors.

More than 32,000 readers took part in FT.com's poll, relishing the opportunity to have their say on the people and 
events that have dominated the pages of the FT over the past quarter of a century.
Most votes came from the UK and the European Union, but there were responses from as far away as Togo and 
the Virgin Islands and one vote was logged from the Vatican City. 
Votes came in from 104 countries.
Some of the nominees proved contentious - engaging and sometimes enraging contributors to our online discussion 
forum. The inclusion of Silvio Berlusconi and Margaret Thatcher in the general poll provoked a flood of responses, 
while the absence of George Soros, Gianni Agnelli and Richard Branson from the business poll spurred advocates 
to argue their case.
For most readers, the end of the cold war and collapse of the Soviet Union were the defining events of the past 25 
years and this was reflected in the tussle between the Pope and Mikhail Gorbachev who went head to head in the 
latter stages of voting.
In the business poll there were several early leaders, with Ryanair's Michael O'Leary yielding to Siemens chief

In the past, getting to his favourite holiday destination in southern France was a tiring affair for Max Weissgerber, a 
20-year- old business student from Dusseldorf. "We used to go by car. It took 14 hours of hard driving to get to 
Biarritz."
Things were different last summer: Weissgerber and his two friends swapped the car for seats on Ryanair, the no-
frills airline. "The flight took 50 minutes, and cost E35 (Pounds 24) one way," he says.
Such compare-and-contrast experiences of the difference that cut- price airlines make are nothing new in Britain. 
But in Germany - where the cheap-flight boom is only now taking hold - they are a hot talking point. Up to 12m 
Germans were expected to fly with cut- price airlines last year, compared with only 2m in 2002, according to 
industry estimates.
In the pioneering spirit associated with such new discoveries, Weissgerber has become something of a guru on 
cheap flights. "My parents recently flew to Rome, and I booked them tickets for E40 one way, compared with E260 
with Lufthansa," he says proudly.
Besides Ryanair, lesser-known carriers such as Germanwings, Air- Berlin and Hapag-Lloyd Flug have sprung from 
nowhere. One-way prices start from a give-away E1, but E30-E70 is more standard. The airlines, operating from a 
dozen national airports, fly within Germany and to all points European - to London and Lisbon, Malmo and Milan.
The boom has reached all corners of society. Helmut Orlowski, a 68- year-old businessman based near Frankfurt, 
has flown to the French city of Perpignan for E1, although airport charges pushed the final cost up. He knows that 
Lufthansa and other established airlines offer free in-flight meals, more comfort and better service, but the ticket 
price is simply more important. "I don't need food on planes," he says.
Budget carriers are changing the way Germans get to work, as well as the way they go on holiday. More people in 
Germany do a weekly, cross-country commute to work than in Britain, and many of them now do it by plane. "I've

been going to work in Cologne on Mondays, and returning to Berlin on Thursdays with cheap airlines for a year," 
says Sigrun Kahl, a 27-year-old researcher who lives in central Berlin.
"I've booked dozens of one-way flights for around E30 each, through to next March," she says. "It took a whole 
afternoon in front of the computer." Without cheap flights, she would have to travel by train on Sunday evenings. 
"The same faces are always there on the 7am flight on Monday mornings," she adds.
However, in a country where the Greens are in government, the cheap-flights boom has sparked environmental 
worries for many Germans - including those who fly regularly. Birgitte Rabe, a 36- year-old Berlin civil servant, 
recently commuted cross-country for six months using Germanwings and Hapag-Lloyd. She worries that the 
increase in air travel - in particular the type of short, one-hour flights she used - are bad for the ozone layer, and for 
the profits of Germany's more environmentally friendly rail system. "I can hardly talk, but I think this whole trend 
towards cheap flights is terrible," she says.
Part of Berlin's political establishment agrees. In September, Hermann Scheer, a senior member of the Social 
Democratic Party, called on Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's government to force airlines to increase ticket prices at 
least to the level of rail fares. "It's ecologically perverted that a flight to New York can be cheaper than a train trip 
from Hamburg to Munich," he said.
The proposal got nowhere, but a groundswell of, somewhat ambiguous, opposition remains. Sigrun Kahl concludes: 
"I know it sounds odd, because I fly every week, but sometimes I wish they would push up the prices to stop these 
flights being so attractive to people like me."

SAS yesterday clinched a crucial pay deal with its unions as the Scandinavian airline confirmed plans to split into 
three and pledged to return to profitability next year.
The flag carrier for Sweden, Norway and Denmark had repeatedly failed to secure union deals as it sought to trim 
losses in the wake of the industry downturn and intensifying competition from no-frills carriers.
However, after warning that failure to reach an agreement could lead to mass redundancies and route closures, 
SAS said the changes would cut costs sufficiently to meet the challenge of rivals such as Ryanair.
"Thanks to the responsible actions of the unions we now have the conditions to become Europe's most competitive 
network company," said Jorgen Lindegaard, chief executive.
Mr Lindegaard said the group, which lost SKr2.2bn (Dollars 289.2m) in 2003, was forecasting net profits of about 
SKr5bn in 2005. He said this would reflect an improved mix of business and economy passengers and higher 
yields.
Mr Lindegaard, who has come under heavy criticism in Sweden for his handling of the restructuring, bolstered his 
own position yesterday by appointing three new presidents to head up the new independent SAS airlines in 
Denmark, Sweden and Norway.
Yesterday's agreements with the pilots and cabin crews ended several months of fraught negotiations in which SAS 
struggled to secure the SKr14bn in savings it said it needed to maintain its current scale.
Its plan to require staff to work longer for less pay met strong resistance, but unions finally caved in 11th-hour talks 
in the early hours of yesterday.
Pilots' pay will drop by 6 per cent, regular bonus entitlements will disappear and expenses levels for overnight stays 
will be reduced. For cabin attendants, the deal involves up to 30 per cent more time in the air as well as a two-year 
wage freeze. In return, SAS will hold off from making wide-ranging redundancies.
SAS lands pay deal ahead of split AVIATION:
SAS said the pay cuts across all employee groups would save it SKr1.5bn in 2005. Its share price closed up 8 per 
cent.
Analysts welcomed the deals in that they strengthened SAS's earnings potential and removed the risk of strikes. 
The unions were less enthusiastic. "This is the worst settlement we have ever made but it was necessary in order to 
save jobs," said Verner Lundtoft Jensen, leader of the Danish cabin crew union.

Air links between Birmingham and Scandinavia are set to be expanded as Skyways, a Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) 
partner carrier, launches a service there from Stockholm next week. 
From March 28 it will operate two round trips on weekdays and one on Sundays, using 48-seat Embraer 145 jets. 
The airline already flies between Stockholm and Manchester. The next day SAS itself will add a new early-morning 
departure for Copenhagen from Birmingham, leaving at 6.25am daily except Sundays. The new services take off as 
Ryanair, the low-cost carrier, is preparing to switch 70 per cent of its Birmingham flights to Nottingham in protest at 
an increase in airport charges. The changes will take effect from April 29.

Sir Richard Branson looks set to relinquish control of Virgin Express, his attempt at setting up a European low-cost 
airline, after he tentatively agreed to a takeover by SN Brussels Airlines.
The move will allow the airlines to stop competing with each other at Zaventem, Brussels' main airport, and focus 
on taking on Ryanair, Europe's largest low-fare airline, which operates out of nearby Charleroi airport.
The proposed deal is the second attempt by the two airlines to link up.
Talks to create a single airline out of the remnants of the defunct Sabena collapsed in February 2002 after investors 
in SN Brussels refused to cede control to Sir Richard.
Negotiations resumed last summer, prompted by a proposal drawn up by Credit Suisse First Boston, which has 
been advising both airlines.
Under the terms of their letter of intent signed yesterday, the two airlines are planning to form a holding company in 
which Sir Richard's Virgin would hold a 29.9 per cent stake, including a put option to sell that stake for Euros 64m 
(Dollars 78m).
The airlines said they would remain separate legal entities and that Virgin Express would keep its stock market 
listing.
Virgin Express has had a chequered history since it was set up in 1996. Hampered by Belgium's high social costs 
and politics it has failed to emulate the success of Ryanair or rival EasyJet.

Despite little industrial heritage and a tiny defence budget, the Republic of 
Ireland has become a European leader in aerospace, at least in two 
particular areas: maintaining and financing airliners. This special feature on 
the country's industry looks at how Ireland has built this expertise and plans 
to consolidate its success. We also look at how the Irish Air Corps is -- 
finally -- deploying new aircraft and at the very different aerospace economy

Body
The rip-roaring growth that secured its Celtic Tiger reputation in the 1990s may have slowed, but for a country of 
fewer than 4 million people on Europe's fringe, Ireland punches above its weight in aerospace, particularly in 
maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) and aircraft finance. It is home to two of Europe's biggest MRO shops -- 
Shannon Aerospace and FLS Aerospace -- and several of the industry's leading lease specialists, including 
Pembroke, RBS Aviation Capital and GE Capital Aviation Services. The continent's largest low-cost carrier, 
Ryanair, has its headquarters at Dublin airport, not far from state-run Aer Lingus, which Ryanair began life 
competing against over the Irish Sea.
So what is behind Ireland's success in aviation? In short: geography, history and government policies. Aer Lingus -- 
now coming back strongly after a near-death experience two years ago -- was built largely on links with the Irish 
emigre community in the USA; Shannon, on Ireland's west coast, was a transatlantic staging point before the 
advent of the jet and has developed -- thanks to generous tax breaks -- into the country's main aerospace hub.
The sector has benefited from Ireland's well-educated, relatively low-cost, English-speaking workforce and 
eurozone membership, and enterprise-encouraging schemes. "It's an easy country to do business in," says Declan 
O'Shea, chairman of the Federation of Aerospace Enterprises in Ireland (FAEI) and vice-president aircraft 
Aviation island; Despite little industrial heritage and a tiny defence budget, the Republic of Ireland has become 
a European leader in aerospace, at least in tw....
maintenance and engineering at FLS Aerospace. "We have a tax system that supports multinationals and state 
agencies that are enthusiastic for inward investment. Labour costs are exposed to the Irish economy, but revenues 
are tied to the European economy."
 
Ranking
The FAEI estimates that around 15,100 people are employed in the aviation and aerospace industry in Ireland. 
Around 7,000 of those work for airlines and a further 2,500 for airports and air traffic management and infrastructure 
providers. Of the remainder, MROs employ 4,000, with 800 each working in manufacturing and "internationally 
traded services" -- leasing and finance as well as software development and employment agencies. According to 
figures from European industry trade body AECMA, Ireland ranks fifth in Europe in size of aerospace manufacturing 
and MRO sector relative to population, employing 2.6 per 1,000 citizens, after the UK, France, Luxembourg and 
Sweden and ahead of countries with sizeable aerospace industries such as Germany, Italy and Spain.
The MRO sector has been the bedrock of Ireland's aerospace industry since the 1970s. This year has seen two 
hugely significant moves. Just over a year after selling its 50% stake in Shannon Aerospace to joint venture partner 
Lufthansa Technik, Swiss MRO company SR Technics burst back into the Irish aerospace scene with a $160 
million deal to buy FLS Aerospace from its Danish owners. At the same time, Icelandic leasing specialist Air Atlanta 
bought Shannon MRO from United Parcel Service (UPS), announcing plans to become a fully fledged third-party 
maintenance house and expanding into the full range of Boeing aircraft.
Ireland's MRO activity is clustered around Shannon airport. As well as Shannon Aerospace and Air Atlanta 
Engineering, there are Lufthansa Technik subsidiaries Lufthansa Turbine Technologies and Lufthansa Aircraft 
Painting. In Dublin, FLS dominates the scene: its six-hangar overhaul facility is next to the city's airport. Another 
Lufthansa Technik subsidiary, Airmotive Ireland, employs around 460 people and Pratt & Whitney also has a facility 
in the city.
The sector was jolted by the aftershocks of 11 September which left independent MROs competing for a shrinking 
pool of airlines and aircraft. However, so far, Ireland's maintenance operations, which grew steadily throughout the 
1990s, have escaped relatively unscathed. The FAEI estimates that around 320 MRO jobs disappeared between 
2000 and 2002, but the sector is still employing a fifth more people than it was in 1998. In fact, for FLS, it has been 
its UK operations which have borne the brunt. In January -- a month before being bought by SR Technics -- it 
announced it was shutting its UK heavy maintenance centres in Stansted and Manchester to concentrate activities 
in Dublin. Around half of its 1,500 UK jobs will go.
The company is continuing line maintenance at Stansted and a joint venture with charter airline MyTravel Airways in 
Manchester, MyTravel Aircraft Engineering, to carry out A checks across its fleet and C checks on its Airbus A320s. 
FLS, owned until 1998 by Aer Lingus, insists that its new ownership will not affect what it calls its "necessary 
restructuring".
 
Merger
For FLS, which has a 1,400-strong workforce in Dublin, it had become increasingly difficult to justify having two 
heavy maintenance centres in the UK and Ireland. Stansted was carrying out around 400,000h of overhaul a year, 
half of them for low-cost carrier EasyJet, but FLS says moving the work to Ireland will not be an issue for its 
customers. Last year, Dublin performed 900,000h of work, well under its capacity of 1.5 million hours. Although the 
merger will ease some of the cut-throat competition in the market, "overcapacity in hangar maintenance" will 
remain, warns Declan O'Shea.
FLS's strategy has been to avoid tussling with often lower-cost rivals for every "747 with tons of maintenance hours 
on them". Instead, he says, "service delivery is now the key. We are transitioning to a service operation. Going out 
in the spot market isn't where it's at. We see ourselves as service providers in the repair-cycle management market, 
Aviation island; Despite little industrial heritage and a tiny defence budget, the Republic of Ireland has become 
a European leader in aerospace, at least in tw....
selling a complete solution and taking all engineering tasks away from airlines so they can concentrate on what they 
do best." He adds: "Unlike some other MROs, we understand what airlines need. We understand what on-time 
departures mean for airlines."
The company has worked at developing specialist niches. It has shops overhauling landing gear and auxiliary 
power units, where O'Shea believes the market for "non-aligned businesses" will grow despite competition from 
original equipment manufacturers. It has also "spent four years specialising" in in-flight entertainment (IFE) and 
other cabin modifications. Recent contracts have included refurbishing eight South African Airways Boeing 747-
400s with IFE and installing Virgin Atlantic's new-style Upper Class cabin with flat bed seats on its 747-400 fleet.
 
Head to head
On the other side of the country, Shannon Aerospace has, with the purchase of FLS by SR Technics, found itself 
head to head with its former joint venture partner. However, while FLS's Dublin activities handle both widebodies 
and narrowbodies, Shannon Aerospace, established 12 years ago and employing around 850 staff in one of 
Europe's most modern MRO facilities, has focused on single-aisle airliners. Unlike FLS, it can depend on contracts 
from "shareholders'" aircraft -- in this case Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners including Scandinavian Airlines -
- for a substantial part of its business, although this proportion will fall from 50% to 40% this year, says head of 
marketing and sales Seven Domke.
The move to newer-generation aircraft and leaner airline operating margins is changing the marketplace for all 
maintenance providers, he says, with intervals between overhauls much less than for previous generation airliners 
and carriers demanding faster response and turnaround times. Domke sees the burgeoning low-cost airline sector 
as a huge opportunity for "two or three years' time" as heavy checks become due on dozens of new Airbus A320 
and Boeing 737 family aircraft.
But if Shannon Aerospace and FLS are cautious about market prospects, one maintenance house is nothing short 
of bullish. Until this year, Shannon MRO -- on the other side of the airport from Shannon Aerospace in a hangar 
opened in October 2002 -- was almost exclusively an in-house maintenance centre for UPS's Boeing 727s. A 
subsidiary of Aer Lingus until 1999, only 10% of its work latterly was for third party customers, mainly on 737s.
 
Expansion
Now, following its takeover in February by Air Atlanta, Shannon MRO will be renamed under the Air Atlanta brand 
and intends to expand its capabilities across the entire Air Atlanta range, by adding 757s, 767s and then 747s. "We 
are optimistic we can deliver two or three type approvals this year," says chief executive John O'Loughlin, who also 
plans to expand the 150-strong workforce by more than a third over the same period.
The tie-up represents a "tremendous opportunity to enhance the product" being offered to its lessees by the 
Reykjavic-based company, says O'Loughlin. "They are out there marketing their range and services and they can 
now add base maintenance and completion to that portfolio." The UPS business will be retained until the end of 
2005, "by which point we would hope to have increased third-party inputs significantly", says O'Loughlin.
In employment terms, the aviation finance sector's contribution to Ireland's aerospace industry may be dwarfed by 
that of the MROs, but its influence on the economy is probably as important, with several of the world's biggest 
players based there: RBS Aviation Capital and Pembroke are in Dublin, and GECAS and Debis Air Finance are in 
Shannon. Ireland's expertise in aircraft financing began in the 1970s when Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA) operated 
in Shannon, but much of the expansion has been recent. RBSAC -- a subsidiary of the Edinburgh-based banking 
giant -- set up in the teeth of the downturn in 2001 because it could "hand pick" skilled managers being let go by 
other finance houses. "The industry was in a downcycle so lots of incumbents ran for the door," says one source.
RBSAC -- which claims to be the number three lessor in the world today with 140 "new technology" aircraft on 
operating lease -- chose Ireland because of its regulatory environment and "critical mass of intellectual capital". 
Aviation island; Despite little industrial heritage and a tiny defence budget, the Republic of Ireland has become 
a European leader in aerospace, at least in tw....
GPA "spawned a lot of inherent expertise in asset management" and lessor-friendly tax treaties with many countries 
made doing business from Ireland attractive, says the source.
Pembroke Group -- a joint venture between Rolls-Royce and GATX Capital -- has been on the scene since 1993. It 
owns 30 aircraft -- mainly Boeing narrowbodies -- and manages a fleet of 120, with chief executive Garry Burke 
describing the company as "much more of a niche player" than some of its competitors. He puts Ireland's success 
in becoming a global centre of excellence in aviation financing down to the government's effort to build a financial 
services sector in the late 1980s, with international companies lured with zero tax rates. "The country became a 
very lessor-friendly environment and still is," he says.
An FAEI report published last month on the future of Ireland's aerospace industry, called Flight Path to the Future, 
argues that, while Ireland has developed a successful aviation sector in MRO and aircraft finance, it has not made 
the "technology leap" to "major player" status that it has in pharmaceuticals and information technology. The report 
says Ireland's aerospace industry has the potential to be similar to Singapore's, an island state with a similar-sized 
population to Ireland's, which has built a world-leading reputation in aerospace technology.
The report proposes linking the industry's two main sectors in a bid to make Ireland a "one-stop centre for 
aerospace excellence". It suggests Irish-based lessors agree package deals with power-by-the-hour MRO provided 
by Irish maintenance houses, making the most of Ireland's low taxes on company profits to "offer competitive rates 
internationally". MROs, the report says, must "develop more higher end value added component repair and process 
technologies that will bring in house component repairs that such companies currently subcontract abroad".
Ireland's aerospace sector, concludes the report, is "at a point where it needs to broaden and deepen its roots and 
move its products and services up the value chain".
The idea of damp, spacious, verdant Ireland as another Singapore may seem far fetched. But, in aerospace terms, 
the Celtic tiger clearly has not finished roaring.
 
Devtec -- high hopes for space
 
Murdo Morrison
Ireland's aerospace sector may be dominated by MRO and finance, but there is a significant manufacturing 
element, typified by small and medium enterprises such as Devtec, based in a 1,000m2 (3,300ft2) unit near Dublin 
airport. Founded as part of a diversification strategy by Aer Lingus in 1982 to provide engineering design services to 
industry, the company, which employs 22 engineers, has built a niche in the space sector, designing supports for 
the Ariane 5's Vulcain 1 and 2 engines.
A subsidiary of New Jersey-based Marotta Scientific Controls since 2002, its customers also include Alcatel, 
Astrium and Avio. It has a sister company, Polyflex Space, in Cheltenham, UK, which employs eight people and 
specialises in making pneumatic valves for satellites. Being a subsidiary of a large US firm, but operating 
independently in Ireland and the UK, gives Devtec the best of both worlds, says sales and marketing manager 
Gerard Fenner, with access to the US market and protection from export licensing restrictions. "European space 
customers want European suppliers. They don't want to be dependent on US products," he says.
The downturn in the launcher and telecoms market has been bad for Devtec, but Fenner believes prospects for the 
sector are looking up and the company says it can grow its combined Irish and UK sales from [euro]4.5 million ($5.6 
million) to g10 million within five years. "The European space programme keeps going despite all the setbacks and 
they are determined to get Ariane 5 back on the straight and narrow," he says. "We think we are at the bottom of 
the valley."
 
Shorts reigns supreme

Murdo Morrison
Over the border in Northern Ireland*, the aerospace sector is dominated by Bombardier's Shorts division. The 
aerostructures business has been a fixture on Belfast's industrial landscape since 1936, and was purchased from 
the UK government by the Canadian company in 1989 during a six-year shopping spree which saw it add Canadair, 
de Havilland and Learjet.
Bombardier Belfast employs 5,600 people, four-fifths of the province's entire aerospace workforce. Although it does 
not carry out any final assembly, it is involved in 11 out of 14 Bombardier aircraft programmes, making the entire 
fuselage of the Learjet 40/45 and structures for the Global, Challenger, CRJ and Dash 8 Q Series ranges, and has 
"leadership" in composites and nacelle technologies within Bombardier. The factory has been singled out as a 
possible site to build the 100-seat Bombardier regional jet under study. The company is one of Boeing's biggest 
aerostructures suppliers in Europe -- it makes the all-composite rudder assemblies for the 737 and nose landing-
gear doors for the 777. In the engine sector, customers include General Electric, International Aero Engines and 
Rolls-Royce. Overall sales last year were £430 million ($795 million), 30% of which was to non-Bombardier 
customers.
The global aerospace downturn has hit Northern Ireland's economy hard. Bombardier in Belfast grew rapidly in the 
late 1990s, adding 2,000 workers in the 18 months to the end of 2000. In the past two years it has shed 1,800 staff. 
"Being on an island means when we let go of people, there is nowhere for them to go, but it is easier for them to 
return when the recovery comes," says Colin Elliott, vice-president engineering at the factory.
Bombardier Belfast is heavily involved in research and development. Current demonstrator projects include 
improving the acoustics of nacelles and developing resin transfer infusion for wing components on regional jets. 
The company works with the city's Queens University, where it sponsors a chair in aerospace engineering, and 
helps fund courses at other universities in the province and the rest of the UK.
The rest of Northern Ireland's aerospace industry comprises mainly technology and precision engineering 
companies. Multinationals with Northern Ireland subsidiaries include Goodrich, Raytheon Systems and Thales. 
There are about 15 other companies employing from 10 to a few hundred staff. Typical among them are Denroy 
Plastics of Bangor, which supplies plastic components for the Eurofighter Typhoon, and Langford Lodge in Crumlin, 
which tests Martin Baker ejector seat mechanisms and supplies Airbus flight control systems to Goodrich.
Six years ago, nine of Northern Ireland's aerospace companies formed the Northern Ireland Aerospace
Consortium, which has 20 members, representing over 97% of the province's aerospace industry in sales and 
employee terms, and is recognised as the official industry body for Northern Ireland, says chairman Paul Madden. 
Members co-operate on training and marketing initiatives, and occasionally on joint bids for work. While many of the 
member companies compete in the same sector, working together as "virtual enterprises" often makes sense, says 
Madden. "With supply chains contracting and the big players wanting fewer points of contact, small companies 
know that on their own they haven't a chance of getting a foot in the door with many of the primes." *When Ireland 
gained independence from London in 1921, the country was partitioned and the six counties which now form 
Northern Ireland stayed within the UK. The so-called "Troubles" broke out in 1969 after a series of civil rights 
demonstrations on behalf of the minority Catholic population prompted a violent response and led to the UK 
sending its army in to restore order. Over the next 25 years, the Irish Republican Army carried out a terrorist 
campaign against the military, police and what it termed as agents of the occupation -- both in Northern Ireland and 
mainland UK. In response, "loyalist" terror groups committed hundreds of murders, mainly of Catholics. The 1998 
Good Friday agreement set a peace process in motion, with a "power sharing" devolved assembly and provincial 
government set up near Belfast. Although the assembly is suspended and sporadic violence still takes place, the 
peace dividend has boosted the economy through tourism and inward investment.

Murdo Morrison
Like many small European countries with limited defence budgets and few strategic commitments, Ireland has long 
pondered its air force's role. The country is outside NATO and has not been involved in an armed conflict since its 
independence in the early 1920s. The main function of its defence forces has been in supporting United Nations 
peacekeeping missions in Africa and elsewhere, but -- other than in providing airborne training for the army and 
occasional personnel -- the Aerchor na h'Eireann or Irish Air Corps, which does not have a long-range heavylift 
capacity, is not involved. Instead, the corps, based at Casement air base outside Dublin, provides transport for 
government ministers and helicopter back-up for the police and ambulance service; it also carries out surveillance 
and fisheries protection in the country's 428,000km2 (132,000nm2) of territorial waters, mostly in the Atlantic; and, 
until this year, offshore search and rescue (SAR).
Various reviews in recent years have tried to define the corps' role and equip it accordingly. In the latest, the 
defence ministry announced in December it plans to issue a tender imminently for up to six light utility helicopters to 
replace an ageing fleet comprising three types: seven Aerospatiale SA316 Alouette IIIs and one AS342L Gazelle 
and four Eurocopter AS365F Dauphins. At the same time, the corps will discontinue its SAR service from Sligo 
airport in the north west, for which it leases a Sikorsky S-61.
There have been two other recent acquisitions: eight Pilatus PC-9 trainers are replacing six Aermacchi SF260WE 
aircraft. The first two will arrive in April, with two more each month until July. The PC-9s will allow pilots to increase 
their flying hours from 150h to 200h because of the aircraft's higher operating ceiling -- Irish weather frequently 
meant training at the SF260's 10,000ft (3,000m) limit was impossible. They will also provide better armed air 
response, says corps commanding officer Brig Gen Ralph James. In December a Bombardier Learjet 45 joined the 
Gulfstream GIV to provide ministerial transport and has been kept busy thanks to Ireland's current six-month 
presidency of the European Union. The main remaining priority for the air corps is to upgrade the Litton V5 radar 
and tactical data management systems on its two CASA CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft.
Over the past decade, one of the biggest problems the air corps has faced has been in retaining pilots. With limited 
opportunities to serve overseas, many were being lured away early to the civil sector as Ryanair and other low-cost 
airlines expanded. Now, thanks to a better pay structure, the average career of a flying officer is 15 years, which, 
according to James, gives the corps at least seven years of a pilot's peak performance.

Wizz Air, the new European no-frills airline, has added five executives to its senior management team, including 
Lynn Wotherspoon, former chief operating officer of Buzz, which was bought by Ryanair last year.
The airline, which will focus on Hungary and Poland as both countries are poised to enter the European Union this 
spring, will launch in May. 
Two former executives from Malev Hungarian Airlines are climbing on board. Andras Hajdu, a former deputy 
general manager and chief commercial officer and Lajos Farkas, who was director of strategic business 
development until last year. Jacek Szkurlat, a former Proctor & Gamble executive, and ex-World Bank senior 
human resources officer Iwona Snaidy are also joining the team.
Last month Malev increased its services between Budapest and London, when it started flying to Stansted airport.

Aer Lingus, the Irish national carrier, continued its recovery in 2003 as further improvements in its operating 
margins and cost reductions offset the impact of falling revenues.
The company, which is 85 per cent state-owned and earmarked for privatisation by the Dublin government, saw 
operating profits advance 30 per cent in the year to December 31 from Euros 63.8m to Euros 83m (Pounds 55.7m), 
despite a 24 per cent drop in sales from Euros 1.17bn to Euros 888m.
After deducting an Euros 8.8m share in profits for employees, who own 14.9 per cent of the company, and adjusting 
for exceptional restructuring charges in 2002, pre-tax profits more than doubled from Euros 36.9m to Euros 79.4m.
The operating margin improved from 6.7 to 9.3 per cent, comparable with EasyJet but still some way behind 
Ryanair, whose low-cost model has been followed closely by Aer Lingus.
Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to 6.6m, with load - or seat occupancy - rates at 81 per cent, up 3 
percentage points from 2002.
Routes out of Ireland to continental Europe saw passenger growth of 27 per cent to 2.1m. Its transatlantic service 
increased by 19 per cent to 1.1m. This was due to the return of normal business following a fall in demand before 
the war in Iraq. The Ireland-UK operation, which it has contracted in recent years, accounts for the rest.
Costs were cut by Euros 89.5m, bringing total savings achieved from its 2001 survival plan to Euros 344m. Almost 
a third has gone from its 2001 cost base.
The company is buying or leasing new Airbus A320s as it moves to one aircraft type on its European routes by 
2005. It announced 13 new routes yesterday.
With the fleet overhaul, capacity is set to increase by 30 per cent during the next two years.
FT Comment
Aer Lingus recovery takes wing TRANSPORT:
* Aer Lingus may today be lumped together with Olympic as one of the few remaining EU national carriers still 
state-owned. But these results underscore that it is a fully commercial company that can compete with Ryanair in its 
own backyard. The government has still to confirm plans to sell its stake. The company favours a private placement 
with institutions, with a commitment to a subsequent initial public offering. The attractions of such a two-stage 
process is that the company can avoid the glare of publicity associated with an IPO during restructuring, which will 
include further staff cuts. But with sentiment towards the sector buoyant, the government would be advised not to 
dither. Competition among low-cost carriers in Europe is set to intensify with margins narrowing.

Singapore-based low-fare start-up carrier Tiger Airways is close to deciding between Airbus A320s and Boeing 737-
700/800s for its fleet.
Tiger, which is being established by Singapore Airlines (SIA) together with investors from the USA and the UK, 
plans to start operating late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter.
The airline says that an air operator's certificate application will be filed shortly. Industry sources say it is leaning 
towards the A320 in part because of availability.
The start-up carrier's chairman William Franke says orders for leased and/or purchased aircraft are due before the 
end of March. Franke is managing partner and co-founder with David Bonderman of US-based Indigo Partners, 
which has a 24% stake in Tiger. The main shareholder is SIA, which has 49%, while SIA's main shareholder, 
Singapore government investment arm Temasek Holdings owns 11%. Irelandia Investments, owned by the family 
of Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, has 16%.
The airline's partners insist the airline will be operated entirely independently from SIA, serving destinations within a 
4h range of Singapore from the city state's main Changi airport.
Franke says the airline aims to start operations with five or six aircraft, adding that past experience of low-fare 
airlines in other parts of the world suggests up to 25 aircraft could be operated by its third or fourth year of 
operation.
Patrick Gan, a Singaporean who spent 18 years in the pharmaceutical sector, has been appointed chief executive. 
He is taking over from acting chief Charlie Clifton, who remains with the company in an advisory capacity.

The unusual job swap between the bosses of Norway's Statoil and Aker Kvaerner raises the intriguing question of 
other executives who might benefit from a change of scene. Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, for example, could do 
wonders for a struggling national flag-carrier such as Alitalia. 
An exchange between DaimlerChrysler's Jurgen Schrempp and Volkswagen's Bernd
Pischetsrieder would allow each to compare the pressures they were under - and Mr Pischetsrieder could then say 
he had run all three of Germany's big car companies.
A swap between Microsoft's Steve Ballmer and Mario Monti, the European competition commissioner, might help 
each see the other's viewpoint. It is a moot point, though, whether the rivalry between France's Bernard Arnault and 
Francois Pinault would be soothed if each had a spell in charge of the other's luxury empire: the incentive to 
maximise shareholder returns might be lacking.
There is one, however, for whom an exchange partner would certainly be hard to find: Yukos's Mikhail 
Khodorkovsky. Many envy his wealth, but few fancy the prospect of a spell in a Moscow prison.

EasyJet lifted passenger numbers by 17.4 per cent in February and saw no slippage in the proportion of seats it 
filled.
The low-cost airline's larger fleet carried 1.87m passengers in February, compared with 1.59m in the corresponding 
month in 2003.
The load factor -a measure of seats sold as a proportion of seats available on each flight - was stable at 89 per 
cent. For the 12-month period to the end of February, the load factor was 84 per cent.
EasyJet shares climbed 5 1/2p to 339 3/4p on the news.
Chris Avery, at JP Morgan, said the February passenger numbers showed that EasyJet's business model continued 
to progress well.
However, he estimated that the extra day in February this year accounted for 4 percentage points of the 17.4 per 
cent passenger growth.
EasyJet discounted the effect of the Leap Year.
EasyJet is benefiting from a marked slowdown in capacity growth to about 20 per cent, which has enabled it to 
maintain yields, or average fare levels - in contrast to its performance a year ago when the much more rapid 
addition of aircraft to its fleet undermined its profitability.
Ryanair is still suffering from the same problem with a 60 per cent jump in capacity leading to a collapse in yields of 
25 to 30 per cent in the current January-to-March quarter.
In January, Ryanair shocked investors by issuing its first profit warning for 15 years and ended a run of 26 quarters 
of rising profits since its May 1997 float.
EasyJet passenger numbers up 17.4%
Mr Avery described demand as elastic and said: "For Ryanair, after seven quarters of 70 per cent growth it 
snapped. EasyJet was sensible and stopped before the elastic snapped. For EasyJet, the yield has come up quite 
quickly since the capacity slowed down. I would imagine that is going to come true for Ryanair as well."

Remember Newquay? Ifso, forget childhood holidays walking along deserted windswept beaches to escape the 
cheap boarding houses. This small Cornish coastal town is now the south-west's hottest property market.
Newquay has just seen a plot of residential-zoned land sell for Pounds 3m an acre - the highest price ever seen 
west of Bristol - while the average price of a detached house now nudges Pounds 250,000, more than 25 per cent 
above the Cornwall average.
What makes estate agents salivate is not only Newquay's 15 per cent price surge in 2003, caused by people 
moving in to take advantage of twice daily Ryanair flights to London, a Pounds 2m surf centre on the Fistral Beach 
and close proximity to tourist draws such as the Eden Project and the National Maritime Museum.
They are also getting excited over what Chris Baxter - land sales manager of Bradleys property consultancy, which 
negotiated the Pounds 3m per acre deal - calls Newquay's future "magnet town" status for the region.
Work begins in the spring on celebrity chef Rick Stein's Pounds 3m Newquay complex including a 30-room 
boutique hotel, two restaurants and a so-called "inclinator" - an external escalator bringing guests from the beach to 
the hotel 60 feet above. Stein hopes to emulate the cultural dominance he now exerts in Padstow, 20 minutes along 
the north Cornwall coast.
Meanwhile, March is scheduled for the unveiling of plans for Prince Charles' 1,000-home "Surfbury" development 
on the edge of Newquay, modelled along the lines of his twee Poundsbury sustainable town in Dorset.
This is all very different from Newquay's history. Some 1600 years ago all that existed was a fortified hunting and 
iron-mining settlement on nearby Porth Island, which is today reconstructed in detail in the Tunnels Through Time 
exhibition in Newquay.
Lager and lattes displace pasties: MICRO MARKETS NEWQUAY: Graham Norwood on Cornwall's hot spot
In the 15th century Bishop Lacey of Exeter allowed the residents of what was then called Towan Blistra to build a 
'New Quay'; it became a busy fishing port and reached its commercial zenith with the catching and trade of 
pilchards in the 17th and 18th centuries.
When the fish went, the industrial revolution came and Newquay concentrated on shipping tin and china clay from 
Cornwall's mines. In the 1950s and 1960s most of the county mines became uneconomic and containerisation 
killed off the minor ports.
Before the airport wooed Ryanair, the area's wealth comprised 11 sandy beaches stretching five miles either side of 
the residential area where Newquay's 21,500 residents live. The beaches host the National Surfing Championships 
each summer and have helped make the town south-west England's party capital for young holidaymakers.
Mr Baxter says: "The potential is enormous. Empty land zoned for housing could accommodate 900 new houses 
over 10 years and the local authorities are gearing up to make the town the focus of Cornwall's main population 
growth.
"The airport is ripe for expansion. It's actually much larger than Plymouth airport 60 miles away so has big unused 
capacity. It could take Boeings easily and could become the far south-west's premier transport link."
Andrew Chilcott of local estate agency Lillicrap Chilcott says 85 per cent of his company's 170 sales last year were 
to non-Cornish buyers.
He says: "There have been air links from Newquay to London for years but they've cost Pounds 300. Ryanair 
services are a fraction of that price so have made it cost effective for people to live in the area and work in London 
part of the week. That's changed the buyer profile for good.
"Padstow and Rock are role models. Ten years ago they were pretty but not much more. Now demand and prices 
are stratospheric." Local agents there say prices of like-for-like properties are twice those in Newquay, mainly 
because of the demand generated by Rick Stein's national profile.
But improved access and greater awareness have inevitable downsides. A few of Newquay's side streets are still 
distinctly tawdry but many tourist attractions have become aggressively globalised - lager and lattes are more 
common than pasties these days.
The local press is combusting with furious letters from long-term residents unhappy about well-heeled businessmen 
flying weekly to London while pushing up house prices on Newquay's outskirts. They are equally irate that local bar 
owners and Ryanair's more downmarket travellers combine to give the town centre a burgeoning reputation as a 
rowdy late night drinking area. One correspondent wrote: "Newquay has lost its innocence."
Mr Chilcott says: "Since 2001, part of the transformation of Newquay has generated bad news about the town 
centre. It's a social fact of life. But the areas around it overlooking the River Gannel and the sandy beaches are 
amongst the most beautiful in the country."

Herb Kelleher has got a lot to answer for. No-one can argue that Southwest is not a great airline, but because of the 
culture he created, almost every low-cost carrier in the world thinks that it has to be funny.
Yes, it was a good joke when the first flight attendant said: "It works just like any other seatbelt. If you do not know 
how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be unsupervised." But when you have heard it the second time, third 
time, or even twice in the same day when making a quick business trip, it starts to grate. The real danger is that 
many people setting up low-cost airlines do not seem to realize that it is a very serious business. Just getting staff 
to make jokes and calling your airline low-cost is not enough. Running a low-cost takes discipline. If someone tells 
you they are setting up a low-cost carrier, ask them what airline class they travel in on business. If they are flying in 
front of the curtain, they do not have a low-cost culture. Southwest employees may tell you that they do not take 
themselves seriously, but they are very serious about their competitors. Ryanair's Michael O'Leary and easyJet 
founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannu, may like telling jokes, but you do not want to see them when they are angry. In some 
ways the hype surrounding low-cost airlines is not unlike the dotcom boom. This is not just because internet 
companies and new low-cost airlines seem to prefer stupid names such as boo.com, clickmango.com, Starfish or 
Song, but also because many will fail. Kelleher founded a great airline with a unique culture, but if anyone thinks 
running a low-cost airline is easy, they should remember one thing: despite the costumes he wore, he was also a 
lawyer.Alasdair Whyte

Highlight: The Slovak Republic may seem like an unusual place for a low-cost airline, but SkyEurope is definitely 
one to watch. Airfinance Journal reports from Bratislava.
Body
Even if it fails in its ambition to become eastern Europe's answer to Southwest, Slovak-based SkyEurope at least 
has the most exciting in-flight magazine in the no-frills sector.
The latest issue has a prominent photo of Christian Mandl, the company's thirtyish CEO sitting next to Pope John 
Paul II. A photo of Wonderbra model, Adriana Karembeu, painted on a SkyEurope aircraft follows on the next page.
As an airline that takes marketing seriously Mandl sees nothing unusual about the apparent sacred and profane 
aspects of his airline's magazine.
"When the Pope comes on a official visit he flies the Italian national carrier Alitalia to the destination and then uses 
the national carrier for any travel within in the country. When Pope John Paul II visited Slovakia it was our greatest 
honour to have been the national carrier," he said.
And Karembeu? "We were in the process of starting a service to Paris and the problem is that almost no-one had 
ever heard of Slovakia as a country, much less as a destination, so we chose to put Karembeu's face on the side of 
the plane." 
It helped that Christian Karembeu, the Slovak model's husband, plays football for France.
Marketing coups aside, SkyEurope is changing air travel in the badly served markets of eastern and central Europe 
and is not afraid of competing with other low-costs, including Ryanair and easyJet.
Launched in 2002 with only two aircraft, SkyEurope has a fleet of six 737s and six Embraer 120s operating out of 
Bratislava and Budapest. It flies to 18 destinations, including London Paris, Milan, Venice, Berlin, Stuttgart, Zurich, 
Prague, Split, Zadar, Dubrovnik and Kosice. 
The airline flew 170,000 passengers for a turnover of (EURO)13 million ($15.9 million) in 2003 and hopes 
passenger levels will rise to 800,000 with sales of more than (EURO)60 million this year.
However, these figures could triple in the next 24 months. "Our plan is to increase the number of operational bases 
to four, operating four 737s and four Embraer 120s at each base to a total of 32," says Mandl.
The pope, the model and the airline
One of these new bases is likely to be in Poland with the other possibly outside the European Union (EU). 
European Union benefits
The EU is important to SkyEurope. The Slovak Republic is one of the 10 accession countries joining the union on 
May 1 and the airline is hoping to benefit from capital flowing into the country.
John Schiffer, an economist at ratings agency Moody's, forecasts that Slovakia's GDP could increase to $32.7 
billion in 2004 from just $19.7 billion in 2000, fuelled by liberal government policies. House prices are expected to 
rise in the country with many companies planning to move businesses there to take advantage of lower labour 
costs.
 "Low-cost air will be the name of the game for travel in this region for two main reasons," says Mandl. "First, there 
is not as developed or competitive ground transport infrastructure as there is in western Europe. Second, there is a 
lack of affordable air transportation because central European cities continue to be served mainly by the high-cost 
flag carriers." EU membership will also allow SkyEurope to fly freely to all member countries. The airline will have 
all air freedoms for the first time, although it could of course be restricted by slots.
While SkyEurope is secretive about its plans for other accession states, particularly Poland, Hungary, Slovenia and 
the Czech Republic, Mandl clearly sees opportunities in these markets. Although, easyJet has already announced 
new routes to Budapest and Prague, he is also not worried about other carriers competing on its existing routes.
"We are not afraid of low-cost competition from carriers that operate on a high-cost basis," says Mandl. "Yes, the 
western low-cost carriers see central Europe as a promising market because of all the growth potential - and we 
know they are preparing to penetrate the region, but it doesn't really make sense to import the labour and real 
estate costs of an airline based in the UK or Germany." 
Politically, SkyEurope has also been helped by the fact that Mandl and Alain Skowronek, SkyEurope's chairman, 
are both of Belgian origin - and that one of SkyEurope's major shareholders is the European Bank of 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
"If the two founders were, say, Czech or Poles, they would have been hassled in the other countries that remain 
sensitive to national issues," a senior legal observer in the region noted. "Also the fact that the EBRD is involved 
lessens the risks of political games as the organization carries more weight and influence than any single country 
within and without central and eastern Europe."
Skowronek came to the venture with experience from EBA Express, which was sold to Virgin Express in 1996, and 
he was also the former general manager of City Bird. 
Mandl had no previous experience with airlines, but was involved in several EU-related projects in central and 
eastern Europe and business development consultancies in Bratislava. 
Both Mandl and Skowronek felt that Bratislava was underserved by airlines, and the split between the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia in 1993 meant Slovakia no longer had a flag carrier. 
The run up to IPO?
While still fairly unknown outside central and eastern Europe the airline is being aggressively courted by 
manufacturers trying to win orders and bankers hoping to win mandates.
SkyEurope is talking with both Boeing and Embraer about ordering and financing aircraft. Leasing companies are 
also being approached, including Gecas, which already leases the airline's 737s, and Finova, which leases 
Embraer jets. 
Mandl says the company is picking financial advisers to advise on funding growth, with the airline still deciding on 
whether to take the company public, raise new funds or allow the entry of a strategic investor into the company.
The pope, the model and the airline
He says that Nikki Lauda, the airline entrepreneur and former Formula One racing car driver, had approached the 
airline but instead decided to take a 51% stake in AeroLloyd in partnership with Air Berlin.
The airline was originally financed through private equity from a consortium of investors, including the EBRD, ABN 
Amro, the EU foundation for Slovakia and several private investors. 
Swiftair, a DHL operator based in Spain, also took a stake at the end of 2001. Mandl and Skowronek have a 28% 
stake in the airline and have an option to increase this if certain performance goals are met.
Some bankers believe that SkyEurope may repeat the experience of Belgium airline EBA Express, which of course 
was founded by Skowronek.
Skowronek successfully launched an IPO of EBA in 1994 raising (EURO)68 million, with the airline eventually 
becoming Virgin Express after Richard Branson acquired the company in 1996 for (EURO)225 million.
While only time will tell whether Mandl and Skowronek will successfully float the carrier, or whether SkyEurope will 
be able to become the Southwest or EasyJet of eastern Europe, the start-up airline in one of the region's lesser-
known capitals is ready to take on established carriers.

When blue and yellow buses labelled "megabus.com" start pulling in and out of London's Victoria Coach station 
today, they will look to most onlookers like unremarkable double-deck buses.
However, for Brian Souter, founder and chief executive of Stagecoach Group - the bus and train operator running 
megabus, which today launches eight new routes to and from London - they are a powerful symbol. He told the 
Financial Times in a rare interview that the launch of the no-frills, low-cost, long-distance bus service showed the 
company had returned to its roots.
New services such as megabus - which Mr Souter called a Ryanair of the bus market after the low-cost airline - 
showed it was once again demonstrating innovative thinking that made it one of the great transport successes of 
the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Tickets on megabus, which has been trialled in central Scotland and from London to Oxford, are sold via the 
internet and start at Pounds 1, with a 50p booking fee on top of that.
The company has also recently tried out new taxi-bus operations aimed at middle-class commuters, and has been 
praised for working closely with local authorities on schemes to promote greater bus use.
"We were the first people to take advantage of Thatcher's deregulation of long-distance buses in 1986," Mr Souter 
said. "We were the first outsiders to buy a company from National Bus when it was privatised. We were the first 
people to win a rail franchise.
"We're just beginning to get these things going again."
Yet Stagecoach - based in Perth, Scotland - is only just recovering from the disastrous purchase of Coach USA, a 
sprawling North American bus, coach and taxi operation, in 1999.
Buses take Stagecoach 'back to roots': Chief believes its new no-frills service shows that the group is once 
again demonstrating innovative thinking, writes Rob....
A write-off of Pounds 575m of the value of Coach USA forced Stagecoach into a loss of Pounds 500m for the year 
to April 2003.
Mr Souter - who with Ann Gloag, his sister and co-founder of the company, still controls about 26 per cent of the 
shares - was forced to return as chief executive in July 2002 to address the problems. He sold much of the Coach 
USA business, reducing it to a core of more profitable routes in the north-east of the country.
One analyst said Stagecoach was now on a firmer footing than it had been for some time but profits were still far 
short of their level before the Coach USA purchase and well below the levels expected of the company.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 last year were Pounds 44.8m on sales of Pounds 964m. Mr Souter 
insisted that shareholders were happy after the sharp recovery in the share price from a low of just over 12p in 
October 2002. The shares closed at 84 1/4p on Friday.
The US businesses had been disposed of faster than anyone had thought possible, he added. Until his return as 
chief executive, management had spent years simply trying to make the Coach USA businesses work better.
"I think that the outcome has been good for everyone," Mr Souter said of his decision to return.
Stagecoach also had some remaining problems to address, the analyst warned. One was performance at Virgin 
Trains, the long-distance UK train operator of which it owns 49 per cent in a joint venture with Sir Richard Branson's 
Virgin Group. The venture earned Stagecoach operating profits of just Pounds 7.2m in the 2002-03 year, on sales 
of Pounds 276m.
Yet Mr Souter insisted the company's train operations were a cause for optimism. Traffic on South West Trains, its 
London commuter franchise, would probably rise sharply as overall train punctuality improved.
Meanwhile, traffic on Virgin CrossCountry, its service linking Scotland and north-east England with Birmingham and 
the West Country, was up 23 per cent year on year following the introduction of new Voyager trains.
It was for Stagecoach's new bus services, however, that Mr Souter reserved most enthusiasm.
That may well be because they face exactly the kind of competition Mr Souter has traditionally relished. Megabus - 
which will use 94-seat, double-deck buses - will face competition from National Express, the established long-
distance operator, and - from the summer - from EasyBus, a minibus operator. EasyBus is part of the EasyGroup of 
Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of EasyJet, the no-frills airline.
During its fast growth, Stagecoach was notoriously aggressive with competitors, sometimes running buses free or 
just before its rivals to force them out of the market.
While Mr Souter said long-distance competition would not be that rough, he had clearly done his homework on his 
rivals. He said he could not understand EasyBus's economics.
"We know it costs Pounds 18 an hour to run Stelios's minibuses and it costs Pounds 27 an hour to run our bus," he 
said. "He has 16 seats to fill and we have another 78 more than he has, for an extra Pounds 9 an hour."
On Friday nights, buses leaving Dundee were regularly full, he said.
Yet, stung by the disasters of the past five years, investors may prove a little more cautious than Mr Souter in their 
enthusiasm for his new ventures.
"When you're charging Pounds 1 a passenger, you need to carry a lot of passengers to make a material difference 
to the profits," said the analyst.

Ryanair announced yesterday that it would pull out of its Charleroi-London route on April 29 following the ban 
imposed this month by the European Commission on subsidies granted to the Irish low-cost carrier at the Belgian 
airport.
The decision follows a warning from Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, that the Commission's ruling would 
force it to scrap some flights. The move to end the service between Charleroi, its Belgium base south of Brussels, 
and London's Stansted airport, Ryanair's largest base in Europe, would be the first route withdrawal since the 
decision.
Mr O'Leary yesterday warned the Walloon government, which owns the airport, that unless it absorbed the cost of 
the increase in air fares as a result of the Commission decision - estimated to be between Euros 6 (Pounds 4.18) 
and Euros 8 per ticket - the airline would consider the future of its other 11 routes.
"As the Brussels-London route has the lowest fares, this route cannot be sustained if costs are to be increased as a 
result of the Commission's decision," Mr O'Leary said.
He added: "Ryanair will shortly be meeting with Brussels Charleroi airport and the Walloon authorities to agree a 
way forward. If these talks result in a new agreement, with a similar low-cost base, then Ryanair's low fares will 
continue at Charleroi."
Serge Kubla, economy minister of the Walloon region, suggested yesterday that a comprehensive deal could be 
reached that would also lead to the reinstatement of the London service.
"I have noted this decision but I am doing everything in my power to talk with Ryanair officials to find possible 
solutions and keep the Charleroi-London line," Mr Kubla told Reuters.
More than 360,000 passengers used the London service last year. Ryanair's lowest fare on the route is Pounds 32 
return.
Charleroi became Ryanair's first base in continental Europe three years ago.

Since then, Europe's largest low-cost airline has grown rapidly and now has 11 bases around Europe.

 (ANSA) - Milan, February 24 - Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair has served over 12 million passengers in Italy since 
1998, when the company started operating in the country, it was reported on February 24, 2004.
Ryanair transported five million passengers on Italian routes in 2003 and plans to carry 7. 5 million in 2004. The 
company operates at 14 Italian airports.

Ryanair was established in 1985. It flies to 84 destinations in 16 European countries. The carrier's fleet comprises 
68 aircraft, of which 62 are Boeing 737.
 Ryanair posted a net profit of 43. 8 mln euro ($ 54. 9 mln) for the first quarter of the fiscal 2003/04, ending March 
31, 2004, up by 12 pct year-on-year. The airline's revenue rose to 245. 2 mln euro ($ 307. 2 mln), while its average

Pity Lord Levene of Portsoken. The chairman of Lloyd's of London and networkerpar excellence has been lumbered 
with a task that will test his diplomatic skills to the limit.
His Lordship is leading the search for JSainsbury's next chairman, after the abrupt about-turn of Sir Ian Prosser. But 
he might find it easier to make money on the fickle reinsurance markets than identify someone acceptable to the 
institutional investors whose anger helped force Sir Ian out.
Having claimed one scalp, the City is expecting Sainsbury to "think out of the box". If Lord Levene is, 
uncharacteristically, unsure of himself, he need only ask investors for the kind of qualities they are looking for in the 
ideal candidate.
The Sainsbury Superhero should have a solid record of good relations with the City and have created shareholder 
value.
Step forward Stuart Rose, the ace communicator who made pots of money for investors in Booker and Arcadia.
People close to Mr Rose think he would love the Sainsbury job but suspect that his straight-talking style would not 
go down well with Sir Peter Davis, Sainsbury chief executive.
There's more. "Lord Levene must ensure that this person possesses strong leadership and motivation skills," adds 
one investor.
Cue City suggestion number two: Belinda Earl, the former chief executive of Debenhams, who enjoyed getting her 
hands dirty on the shop floor.
Mr or Ms Perfect should have sufficient charm to deal with the Sainsbury family, which holds 38 per cent of the 
shares. Another investor adds that the grocer requires someone who has embraced and led change.
Searching for a superhero for Sainsbury: The institutional investors will be very hard to please, write Sundeep 
Tucker andSusanna Voyle
As for the oomph factor ... "This a company with deep -rooted problems," says another fund manager. "It needs a 
person of vision and dynamism to turn it round."
Hence widespread City backing for Archie Norman, the Tory MP who shouldered the burden of rescuing Asda in 
the 1980s.
Another suggestion is Michael O'Leary, the outspoken chief executive of Ryanair. One fund manager said: "He's a 
great champion of the consumer and would break all the rules. Sainsbury's needs someone with his chutzpah."
Alas, none of the suggestions would fit the template set out by Sainsbury when it started its search. The group said 
it did not want a retail figure because Justin King, the incoming chief executive, already filled that bill.
It remains to be seen what the new brief will be. The nominations committee, led by Lord Levene, has yet to meet. 
And nobody knows whether the five independent non-executive directors will pick from the old shortlist - or start 
again.
Some in the City lament the difficulties in finding a chairman. One investor sighed: "In the old days, all we used to 
do was ring up Conservative Central Office and they would put us in touch with a Tory who was willing to chair a 
company."
Indeed. That particular gene pool is now horribly small. Whereas once upon a time Lords Young, Younger, and 
Hurd were summoned to the boardroom, nowadays the likes of camera-ready Michael Portillo have been floated as 
a possible chairman for BAE Systems.

Ryanair is taking the concept of a no-frills airline one step further by ordering new aircraft without window blinds, 
headrests or reclining seats in order to save money.
The Irish airline, struggling to cut costs after its first profit warning in 15 years, is also considering sweeping 
changes to the way baggage is dealt with in a move that could see charges for checking in luggage. 
But the cost-cutting could have one benefit for cramped customers: leather seats.
Ryanair has decided the savings from easy-to-clean leather make it worth paying the higher cost to replace cloth 
seats on the new aeroplanes being ordered from Boeing.
The airline has already become one of Europe's most popular by cutting out previously standard items such as free 
food and drink and passing most of the savings on to customers.
It said fares could be cut again as a result of the lower costs and that the "frills" would not be missed as most flights 
were under an hour.
"In return (Ryanair) will be able pass on even lower air fares," it said.
The company has suffered a double blow in the past month as the European Commission ruled that payments to 
the airline by government-owned airports were illegal and passenger growth targets were missed.
Ryanair is not alone in trying to cut out all the trimmings.
Easyjet reduced the number of toilets on its latest aircraft order from three to two to save money and squeeze in an 
extra seat. It argues that because there is no free drink on board, it needed fewer toilets.

EasyJet yesterday added routes to Budapest and Basel to its Berlin network, bringing the total number of 
destinations to be served this summer from the German capital to 13.
The UK operator, which is vying with Ryanair for leadership of Europe's low-cost airline sector, also plans an initial 
eight routes from its new German base at Dortmund, due to open in May.
Less than a year after it abandoned its plan to take over Deutsche BA, the lossmaking German subsidiary of British 
Airways, it has entered the market directly.
EasyJet said the takeover failed to go ahead because of the "rigidity" of German labour laws and its inability to 
negotiate a satisfactory deal with the DBA pilots.
Now, it has opened bases at Berlin-Schonefeld and Dortmund airports.
From Dortmund it is launching eight routes including to Paris Charles de Gaulle, London Luton, Nice, Palma, 
Alicante and Rome Ciampino.
EasyJet is expected to announce next week that it is also adding Cologne-Bonn as another destination to be served 
from the UK.
The rapid expansion by EasyJet into the German market is posing a growing threat not only to Lufthansa, the 
German flag carrier, but to the smaller German low-cost airlines, that have sprung up to try to imitate the success of 
Ryanair and EasyJet led by Air Berlin, Hapag-Lloyd Express and Germanwings.
Air Berlin is the leading operator at Dortmund accounting for about 65 per cent of its traffic.

EasyJet will announce today that it is to open a second German operating base at Dortmund airport this summer, 
intensifying its attack on the continental European market.
It is also making its first significant move into eastern Europe, with daily services from London Stansted to Ljubljana, 
Slovenia, and from London Luton to Budapest from May 1.
The launch coincides with the entry into the European Union of 10 countries, and is expected to herald a big 
expansion by low-cost carriers, which have tended not to penetrate further into the region than Prague.
Several start-up carriers have recently launched operations from eastern Europe. SkyEurope Airlines based in 
Bratislava, Slovakia and with a second base in Budapest, flies to 18 destinations in 12 countries, including London 
Stansted.
EasyJet announced a package of seven new routes including Basel and next week is expected to add Cologne-
Bonn.
The move into Dortmund will take it into direct competition in the densely populated North Rhine Westphalia 
catchment area with both Hapag-Lloyd Express, the low-cost offshoot of the Tui travel group, and Germanwings, 
the no-frills airline affiliate of Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, which both started up from bases at Cologne-Bonn 
airport in 2002.
EasyJet's presence could also start to outstrip that of Ryanair in Germany, which flies to seven destinations in the 
country.

 (ANSA) - Rome, February 12 - Low-cost air carriers should be allowed to sign economic agreements with airport 
operators aimed at boosting traffic, especially in smaller towns, Italian Senator Egidio Pedrini of the Senate's 
Autonomy Group said on February 12, 2004.
Only 3. 0 pct of Italians currently use air transport, but most people are waiting for the prices of airline tickets to 
drop, Pedrini said. Low-budget carriers definitely contribute much to the increase of traffic through airports, 
especially smaller ones, thus boosting the economy of smaller towns, he added.
 Italy does not have to suffer the consequences of the European Union's decision to fine Irish low-cost air carrier 
Ryanair for signing an agreement with Belgium's Charleroi airport.
 (ANSA).
The European Commission (EC) closed in early February 2004 the investigation about some 15 mln euro ($ 19 
mln) allegedly allocated as subsidies to Ryanair by Belgium's southeastern Walloon region. The EC ruled that 
Ryanair should pay back to Walloon at least 30 pct of the regional subsidies and that the two business partners 
must review the financial terms of their contract.

The European Commission has ruled that Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair received illegal subsidies to operate its 
base at Brussels South Charleroi airport. The more xenophobic elements of the UK press immediately dusted off 
their "Brussels bans..." headlines and predicted the demise of low-fares airlines.
These fears are, however, wide of the mark. If, as expected, Ryanair appeals against the ruling, the airline could 
play an important role in shaping the regulation of the no-frills market.
In its ruling, the EC approved over three-quarters of the incentives Ryanair received from the government of 
Wallonia. In doing so, it authorised certain forms of aid which "permit genuine development of new routes under 
clearly defined conditions". The Commission is also promising, albeit hazily, to produce guidelines clarifying exactly 
how publicly owned airports can continue to offer incentives to airlines and stay within European Union competition 
laws. These should be welcomed.
Despite initial protestations by Ryanair's forthright chief executive Michael O'Leary that the ruling would be 
"catastrophic" for the low-fares industry, few other budget airline chiefs have lined up behind him. Ryanair's largest 
rival, the UK's EasyJet, has welcomed the decision, saying it removes uncertainty from the industry. Furthermore, 
far from shedding services from Charleroi, Ryanair is expanding from its Belgian base and is set to renegotiate 
contracts with other state-owned airports to ensure they comply with the law. Equally, battered Ryanair shares have 
rallied as investors have realised the ruling does not fundamentally challenge Ryanair's business case.
All low-fares airlines rely on deals with airports to a greater or lesser degree. Ryanair, however, is particularly 
sensitive to state-aid probes, since it flies to more publicly owned airports than its rivals. Provincial governments are 
only too keen to strike deals with Ryanair since the economic benefits of daily flights far outweigh any costs 
Banned aid; Instead of complaining about the EC ruling on illegal subsidies, Ryanair should ensure new 
guidelines work for the low-cost sector, not against it
associated with discount airport deals. However, as the law stands, no taxpayers' money can be used to give unfair 
advantage to one airline or another. It is ironic that Ryanair should have fallen foul of a rule designed to prevent 
governments propping up cash-guzzling state flag carriers.
The EC was particularly critical of the secret nature of Ryanair's deal with Charleroi. This lack of transparency did 
give the airline an unfair advantage over others, like Virgin Express, that tried to broker similar deals with the 
airport. Ryanair retorts that secrecy is the industry norm, for large and small airlines.
Perhaps, but this distorts the market in favour of larger players. The EC's guidelines are sure to call for 
transparency when dealing with public bodies. Far from raising prices, this should lead to lower airport charges. 
Airport operators faced with clear information on neighbouring airports' deals will be forced to address efficiency 
issues at their own operations to match rivals, or risk losing business.
Charleroi is a shining example of how to run a low-cost airport. The airport's check-in staff process almost twice as 
many passengers per employee as those at Brussels National. Catering almost exclusively for low-fares carriers, 
Charleroi also uses a less- expensive airside infrastructure than other airports. As a result it is profitable five years 
ahead of target.
Charleroi offsets the hit it takes in discounted charges with income from non-aviation revenue streams, such as 
retailing and car parks. Small private airports have long found ways of turning a profit despite charging low landing 
fees, but it is an indication of how badly run many public airports are, that the "single till" approach should be 
considered revolutionary. In its ruling, the EC recognised the right for airports to use such loss leaders, common in 
other industries. Other public airports struggling with low-fares airline economics should use Charleroi as a case 
study, and new EC rules will allow this.
European legislation created the low-fares airline industry and by promising to produce guidelines for regional 
airports, it is attempting to prove its consumer-protection credentials. However, in the past the no-frills sector has 
suffered from poorly drafted EC legislation as a result of a lack of influence in Brussels. Ryanair must accept that 
increased regulation is an inevitable result of the market's increased size, and must work with the EC to ensure the 
new guidelines work for its interests not against them. Ryanair should channel its energy into shaping the rules for 
the next phase of low-fares travel in Europe rather than simply crying foul.

The French government is to revise its airport tariff policy to prevent the country's 190 state-run airports 
contravening European state-aid rules. The move comes in the wake of a ruling last week that Irish low-cost carrier 
Ryanair was illegally given Belgian state aid to operate from Brussels South Charleroi airport.
The union of French airport operators UCCEGA agreed changes to its tariff structure in a meeting late last week 
with the country's transport minister. The EC ordered Ryanair to repay around 25% of the estimated c15 million 
($18.8 million) it received in assistance from the Walloon state government in incentives.
Ryanair chief financial officer Howard Millar says the airline is talking to all of the publicly owned airports it serves to 
bring their contracts into line. "Charleroi is very fixable, the airport will adjust its published tariffs to match the 
discounted ones,"he says.
Airport charges in several European countries are set centrally, giving airports no power to bring charges into line 
with discount deals. Ryanair says 18% of its destinations are to state-owned airports, but its 16 destinations in 
France and a further six in Spain are a "core concern" since airports cannot individually alter deals.
Jacques Sabourin, UCCEGA delegate general, says the association has been trying to change the tariff structure 
for over 12 months but that the Charleroi ruling has given the plans extra impetus and the rules could be changed 
within a month. "We have to keep low-fare carriers in medium-sized French towns and to do this the rules have to 
change," he says.
Ryanair plans to appeal against the Charleroi ruling on the grounds that it breaks the private investor principle that 
permits governmental investment where it would be considered reasonable by a private shareholder. "Charleroi is 
profitable five years ahead of plan so it obviously was a sound business proposition," says Millar.Copyright 2004

airports, it is attempting to prove its consumer-protection credentials. However, in the past the no-frills sector has 
suffered from poorly drafted EC legislation as a result of a lack of influence in Brussels. Ryanair must accept that 
increased regulation is an inevitable result of the market's increased size, and must work with the EC to ensure the 
new guidelines work for its interests not against them. Ryanair should channel its energy into shaping the rules for 
the next phase of low-fares travel in Europe rather than simply crying foul.

FLSAerospace and Ryanair are embroiled in a dispute over maintenance performed on six of the airline's Boeing 
737-200s, which the Irish carrier claims it was forced to retire early due to damage caused during paint removal.
The aircraft sustained potentially damaging scribe marks on their fuselages caused by a non-approved paint-
stripping technique.
FLSsays: "It is unfortunate that Ryanair has publicly associated FLS Aerospace with this matter as there is no 
evidence whatsoever that these scratches occurred as a result of painting carried out at FLS Aerospace."
The row comes as concerns grow that scribe marks caused by maintenance facilities' use of metal, instead of 
wooden, instruments to remove paint from lap joints could lead to catastrophic damage to the fuselage.
In September 2003, Ryanair made a statement about the retirement of its 737s, saying that work undertaken at 
FLSAerospace was the reason for accelerating the retirements. A month later, the USFederal Aviation 
Administration issued an airworthiness bulletin saying that scratching on aircraft hulls caused during particular 
maintenance procedures has the potential to lead to cracking "and subsequent hull loss". It added that a Boeing 
examination revealed that scribing can lead to cracks 130mm-250mm (5-10in)-long 24,000 cycles after the damage 
was caused. One aircraft showed cracking after only 22,000 cycles.
FLSAerospace, which has since sold the Bournemouth facility that carried out the work, says "other aircraft, not 
painted by FLSAerospace, have been found to have similar markings and we believe this may be a wider industry 
issue".
Boeing says it has been asking all operators to inspect all aircraft for scribe marks at all structural edges - including 
lap joints - between fuselage panels and butt joints forming the circumferential seam between fuselage sections. 
"We have told operators and service centres not to use sharp instruments to cut off the sealant, and to inspect 
aircraft for evidence of marks and report back."Copyright 2004 Reed Business Information LimitedCopyright 2004

An interesting admission by Loyola de Palacio, 53, the EU transport commissioner spotted by Observer just after 
that ruling last week against Ryanair among the glitzy shops on Brussels' Avenue Louise.
"I miss the Spanish light," the Spaniard told the Irish Independent - a reference to the gloomy Belgian weather (for 
garrulous Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary the words "de Palacio" and "see the light" might have a different meaning).
It seems unlikely that de Palacio was planning a not-so cheap flight to somewhere warm for the weekend - she 
famously works all hours. But her comments suggest she is serious when she says that she will not seek a return to 
Brussels once the commission's mandate expires in November. Nor is she expecting a high profile role in Spanish 
politics, apparently.
So what will she do? Observer hears that, as well as a bit of hobby painting, she plans a career in teaching, 
perhaps somewhere such as the university of Florence.
Her aides are already scouring her archives in Brussels for material that could be used for a course in "market 
liberalisation" - a cause that she has espoused during her time as commissioner, whatever Ryanair thinks. O'Leary 
would no doubt make an excellent pupil.

From Mr Steven Parker.
Sir, What an extraordinary letter you published from Mr Michael Tscherny ("How to get on the right side of those 
Eurocrats", February 6).
The case of Ryanair continues a well-established European Union pattern of alternation between being ineffectual 
and inappropriately effective. The letter of European law may have been adhered to in the recent judgment, but 
surely it is a violation of its spirit to remove or limit the operation of a mechanism that benefited the European 
consumer and, by its removal, bolster inefficient practice of state-owned airlines?
As to the notion that more respect is owed to the European Commission ex officio, any organisation where poor 
governance is so rife, where back-scratching and the promotion of favourites so normal, and where fraud is not 
infrequent, should expect heavy criticism until it shows at least an inclination to reform.
Until then, the best reason for supplicants to leave their egos at the gate (as Mr Tscherny puts it) is that there is no 
room for any more inside.

You cannot blame Ray Webster for rubbing salt in Ryanair's wound. The chief executive of EasyJet, the budget 
airline, has had to endure years of bombast from his Irish rival so it is understandable he should be a little smug at 
its two weeks of extreme turbulence. 
Ryanair's first profit warning, due to over-rapid expansion, has been followed by a European Commission ban on 
subsidies that it received at Brussels' Charleroi airport.
In contrast, EasyJet yesterday reported a stable January load factor of 77 per cent, better than Ryanair's 71 per 
cent. Mr Webster said the company's "prudent" strategy made it cautiously optimistic about the current year - 
though it is not so long since EasyJet was losing money and looking imprudent with its rapid expansion.
The companies have somewhat different business models, with Ryanair focusing on secondary airports and 
EasyJet on established ones. So Mr Webster could not resist crowing yesterday about his "durable and 
sustainable" model, and welcoming the Charleroi decision as supportive of the low-cost airline industry.
Despite such knockabout, the European market should provide good growth for both airlines for years to come. Yet 
EasyJet still trades at a big discount to its rival. On the earnings estimates of Chris Avery, of JP Morgan, Ryanair 
stands on a p/e of 18 for the year to March 2005, with EasyJet on 10.5 to September 2005.
Ryanair has certain advantages but for a company with its growth prospects, EasyJet looks undervalued.

The introduction of foreign-owned treatment centres in the National Health Service will revolutionise health care in 
the same way that Ryanair and EasyJet have transformed the airline industry, says a former head of strategy at the 
Department of Health.
Penny Dash, now a consultant to the NHS and the private sector, said the new centres could land a "double 
whammy" on the private sector as NHS waiting times were cut. 
Demand for private treatment was likely to slow at the same time as overseas providers won the treatment centre 
contracts rather than UK groups such as Bupa, BMI and Capio.
But NHS hospitals - and primary care trusts that purchase their services - would also face challenges. They were 
likely to be left with higher proportions of emergency patients as routine surgery moved into the 90 or more factory-
style treatment centres, run by both the NHS and the private sector.
Standard NHS hospitals would be left with the more complex cases as well as the emergency workload, with 
significant implications for the resources they needed to keep going, wrote Ms Dash in the British Medical Journal.
And while initially many of the staff in the treatment centres would come from overseas, in time UK-trained staff 
would apply for such posts. As a result "the NHS will have to become a better employer to compete for staff as well 
as patients".
Evidence from the US and Canada showed treatment centres could lower costs and get better clinical results by 
focusing teams of staff on particular conditions, adopting strict protocols for treatment, and working intensively. "The 
capacity to deliver quality care at lower costs led to the new (overseas) providers winning contracts for treatment 
centres over the current private sector players."

EasyJet, the UK low-cost airline, yesterday issued a confident trading statement in sharp contrast to last week's 
profit warning from Ryanair, its no-frills rival.
The group is also expected to announce shortly that it is planning to intensify its attack on the continental European 
market with the opening of a second German operating base at Dortmund.
EasyJet announced that its passenger traffic had increased by 12.3 per cent in January and that it had managed to 
fill 77 per cent of its seats, unchanged from a year ago. It said it was achieving "a high and stable load factor".
Ray Webster, EasyJet chief executive, said the group was continuing to trade "in line" with expectations and he 
remained "cautiously optimistic" about the financial year to the end of September.
The airline is benefiting from a marked slowdown in capacity growth to about 20 per cent, which has enabled it to 
maintain yields or average fare levels in contrast to its performance a year ago, when the much more rapid addition 
of aircraft undermined its profitability.
Ryanair is still suffering from the same problem with a 60 per cent jump in capacity leading to a collapse in yields of 
25 to 30 per cent in the current January-to-March quarter.
Last week, it shocked investors by issuing its first profit warning for 15 years and ended a run of 26 quarters of 
rising profits since it was first floated in May 1997.
The EasyJet share price has recovered strongly in recent weeks, reaching a 12-month peak of 380p in mid-January 
from a low of 163p in June last year.
It closed last night 5 1/2p lower at 324 3/4p.
Dortmund will become the group's fourth operating base in continental Europe after Geneva, Paris-Orly, and Berlin-
Schonefeld.
EasyJet puts rival in the shade TRANSPORT:
The opening of the bases in Berlin and Dortmund marks EasyJet's first concerted entry into the German market. 
Previously, it had flown only between London Stansted and Munich.
It follows the airline's decision last year to abandon its plan to take over Deutsche BA, the former lossmaking 
subsidiary of British Airways, which would have made it the largest scheduled airline in Germany after Lufthansa.

Communist rules," said Michael O'Leary this week. For the combative chief executive of Ryanair, the European 
Commission's move to outlaw his company's deal on charges at Belgium's Charleroi airport is nothing short of a 
"disaster" for the whole of the low-cost airline sector, the consumer and publicly owned airports.
His anger is understandable. His deal at Charleroi - elements of which Ryanair has replicated around much of its 
network - is spoken of with awe and disbelief by some of his less successful rivals. "The magnitude of the deal was 
phenomenal, they had negotiated a fabulous deal, if it was legal," says the chief executive of one competing no-frills 
carrier.
But the sense of doom conveyed by Mr O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive for the past 10 years, over the Charleroi 
verdict has not been shared by many in the aviation industry. Ray Webster, chief executive of rival EasyJet, 
yesterday repeated his welcome for the Brussels ruling. "We see it as supportive of the low-cost airline industry," he 
said.
There is little love lost between the two airlines vying for leadership of the low-cost market: Mr O'Leary recently 
described EasyJet as "not the brightest sandwich in the picnic". He dismissed his rival again this week as "just 
another high-fares airline" for its backing of the Brussels line on state aid.
But markets, too, have reacted calmly to the Commission's ruling. Ryanair's shares this week clawed back some of 
the ground lost so dramatically a week ago, when the company issued its first ever profits warning. "We believe the 
low-cost revolution will survive," says Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst at ABN Amro. "Stag parties will still be 
able to drink their way around Europe. Villa owners will still reach their places in the sun."
Ryanair talks of disaster, but the low-cost revolution flies on: AIRLINES: The no-frills carrier has lost its battle 
over subsidies at Belgium 's Charleroi airp....
Chris Avery, aviation analyst at JP Morgan, says the Brussels ruling does "not fundamentally challenge Ryanair's 
business model". It could cut operating profit margins from 25 per cent to about 22 per cent, but Ryanair would "still 
be the most profitable airline in the world".
Ireland's Ryanair has been one of the pioneers of the low-cost revolution that has swept Europe within the past 
decade. The arrival of low-cost carriers opened up a range of direct routes to destinations that could previously 
often only be reached via main "hub" airports. Fares are a fraction of previous levels.
The new low-cost airlines have also shaken up national flag carriers such as British Airways, KLM and Lufthansa, 
which are being forced to restructure and drastically to reduce some fares in order to compete.
The low-cost model is not broken. But the end is probably in sight for the golden era of virtually giveaway flying that 
consumers have recently enjoyed. It is not just the European Commission that is to blame. Other factors coming 
into play will force up costs for the no-frills operators - and those rising costs will eventually be passed on in higher 
fares when the present glut of new aircraft capacity is absorbed.
Ryanair has been growing at a hectic pace. By late in the decade it forecasts it will be carrying 50m passengers a 
year, eclipsing even Lufthansa, Air France and BA as a European short-haul airline, with a fleet of 149 aircraft by 
2009.
It has been forced to flood the market for months with special deals to try to fill the stream of aircraft coming into its 
fleet. Any excuse has been good enough to push out yet another promotion, and consumers have started to take it 
for granted that they can fly around Europe for only a few pounds or even for a few pence.
In December there were 100,000 seats at 50p including taxes to celebrate the centenary of the Wright brothers' first 
powered flight. This month there are flights from Euros 1.99 to mark the opening of the airline's latest operating 
base at Barcelona-Girona. Before Christmas there were flights at 1p plus tax to celebrate, well, Christmas. And 
there were another 240,000 free seats - just pay the tax and airport charges - to celebrate the first month when 
Ryanair flew 240,000 more passengers in Europe than BA.
The giveaways have been great for those consumers flexible enough to fly when the airline most needs to fill its 
seats, and who are not too bothered about the destination for a weekend break. But Ryanair is reining in the era of 
wild growth.
From May its annual rate of capacity growth is due to fall from more than 50 per cent - as it has been for the past 
two years - to just 20 per cent. It is negotiating with Boeing to delay until later in the decade some of the deliveries 
due under its record order for 125 aircraft. Ryanair wants to ensure that annual capacity growth is maintained at no 
more than 20-25 per cent for the next few years.
Even Mr O'Leary has been shocked at the way the airline is being forced to slash its prices at the moment to try to 
fill seats, an effort that has been only partly successful. Last week Ryanair's profit warning included the disclosure 
that its yields, or average fare levels, were expected to drop year-on-year by 25-30 per cent in the current January- 
March quarter. Yet Ryanair also announced this week that its closely watched load factor, the share of available 
seats it manages to fill, had fallen in January to 71 per cent from 76 per cent a year ago.
EasyJet, by contrast, yesterday reported an unchanged load factor for January of 77 per cent. A year ago it was 
suffering the same sort of indigestion now being experienced by Ryanair after going on a similar capacity binge, but 
it slowed the madcap growth earlier, with the result that its yields are now holding up.
Ryanair is also finding it increasingly difficult to to manufacture big cost savings. Switching sales and distribution on 
to the internet, for example, lowered costs sharply. Now about 96 per cent of initial seat sales are made via the web 
- so scope for further cost-cutting is limited, even though there is potential to increase so-called ancillary revenues 
such as commissions on car hire, hotel and travel insurance bookings.
Ryanair talks of disaster, but the low-cost revolution flies on: AIRLINES: The no-frills carrier has lost its battle 
over subsidies at Belgium 's Charleroi airp....
Ryanair's rivals found the level of support offered at Charleroi eye-popping. According to the Commission, it 
included a 50 per cent discount on landing charges to Euros 1 per boarding passenger; a preferential rate of Euros 
1 per passenger for ground handling charges instead of the Euros 8-Euros 13 charged to other airlines, pushing the 
fee below the cost of providing the service; and a contribution towards promotional activities of Euros 4 per 
passenger for up to 26 flights daily and for 15 years.
There were also initial incentives of a total of Euros 1.92m (Pounds 1.3m) for opening new routes, Euros 768,000 in 
reimbursements for pilot training and Euros 250,000 for hotel accommodation costs.
"Most airports around Europe will give incentives for new route development with a discount off the published tariff 
charges for a period of time, perhaps three years," says the chief executive of one European no-frills carrier. "And 
most airports will commit to spending money on marketing support to promote your new routes. The difference at 
Charleroi was the scale."
According to Mr Lobbenberg, the ruling that some of the subsidies at Charleroi constitute illegal state aid "is not a 
disaster for Ryanair, but should increase its airport and marketing costs materially".
The aviation industry is now waiting for official guidelines to be issued by the Commission arising out of the 
Charleroi case, but, apart from Ryanair, few appear concerned by the implications. FlyBE, the UK regional low fares 
carrier, said it believed none of its airport deals in France "appear to fall under the Charleroi ruling".
The guidelines are likely to limit aid to a period of five years and also to 50 per cent of the net start-up costs 
incurred. It will have to be available to any airline on a non-discriminatory basis. Deals offered by publicly owned 
airports will have to show a return that a private investor would accept.
But regardless of the Charleroi ruling, Ryanair already faced an array of extra cost pressures. A big jump in charges 
is expected at Ryanair's biggest base, at London Stansted airport, where BAA, the operator, is starting work on 
Pounds 2bn plans to build a second runway and terminal. Stansted aims to double capacity to 50m passengers 
annually within 10 years. Mike Clasper, BAA chief executive, says the expansion must chiefly be paid for by airlines 
through higher landing charges.
Ryanair's present discounted deal at Stansted comes up for renegotiation in 2006. It is the biggest single carrier at 
the airport with about 50 per cent of all the take-off and landing slots, and a fierce battle is in prospect when BAA 
seeks to push up its charges.
Other charges are hitting Ryanair. Last week it lost a high-profile disability discrimination case and was ordered to 
provide free wheelchair assistance at Stansted. Along with the rest of the European airline industry, Ryanair must 
also soon start paying new forms of compensation under recently approved European Union passenger rights 
legislation for denied boarding, flight cancellations and long delays.
Mr Lobbenberg says the airline is already trying to rebuild its fares through "stealth taxes," such as higher credit 
card fees and a 50p wheelchair surcharge imposed immediately after the loss of last week's court case.
Passengers, though, can take some comfort, from the fact that airlines also face increasingly fierce competition, 
which will limit their ability to pass on rising costs in higher fares.
A host of new low-cost carriers offering scheduled services has sprung up around Europe in the past couple of 
years to imitate Ryanair and EasyJet. They include BMIbaby and Jet2 in the UK, Germanwings, Hapag-Lloyd 
Express and Air Berlin in Germany, SkyEurope in Slovakia, Volareweb.com in Italy and Norwegian.no in Norway. 
Another, Flying Finn, is struggling to avoid bankruptcy.
A wave of extra capacity has also been ordered: EasyJet is to take delivery of 120 new aircraft. Eventually there will 
be a shake-out across the industry. But for the moment the new entrants are easily outnumbering the bankruptcies. 
Penny fares may be over, but the low-cost revolution is not.
Ryanair talks of disaster, but the low-cost revolution flies on: AIRLINES: The no-frills carrier has lost its battle 
over subsidies at Belgium 's Charleroi airp....
Michael O'Leary's briefing for journalists in a swanky Brussels hotel on Tuesday was a vintage performance. There 
was no suit and tie, but jeans and a crumpled shirt. The Ryanair chief executive ranted and raved, pulled faces for 
the camera, and cracked jokes like a stand-up comedian.
For his opponents, the 42-year-old Irishman had nothing but scorn. Not only were the regulators that had just 
slapped down his company's practices utterly wrong, they were an "evil empire".
While the low-cost sector and aviation in general have attracted a fair share of colourful entrepreneurs - Richard 
Branson, of Virgin, and Stelios Haji-Ioannou, formerly of EasyJet, to name two obvious examples - no one has 
taken as much pleasure in offending his customers and rivals as Mr O'Leary.
Take his views on travel agents: "Screw the travel agent," he told the Financial Times last year. "Take the fuckers 
out and shoot them. What have they done for passengers over the years?"
Or his view on Ryanair customers who want their money back because a relative has fallen ill. "We don't fall over 
ourselves if they . . . say, ,'My granny fell ill'. What part of no refund don't they understand? You are not getting a 
refund so fuck off."
And his opinion of rival aviation executives can be more or less summed up in a remark he made last September 
about Jurgen Weber, the former boss of Lufthansa: "Consistently wrong."
Many argue that his legendary outbursts have helped raise the company's profile and preserve Ryanair's image as 
the perpetual outsider and underdog - an image it has clung to even though the carrier now flies more passengers 
across Europe than British Airways and even though its shares, despite last week's steep fall, remain among the 
most highly valued in the sector.
Yet there are also those who point out that Mr O'Leary's bad-boy act has its downsides. Throughout the European 
Commission investigation into Ryanair's airport subsidies, for example, Brussels officials warned that his abrasive 
manner and offensive language were not going down well - although no one suggests that a kinder, gentler version 
of Mr O'Leary might have escaped the largely adverse ruling his company received.
Perhaps more importantly, Ryanair never succeeded in winning broad support from other low-cost carriers in the 
case. In fact, when the ruling against Ryanair was announced on Tuesday, a succession of airlines congratulated 
the Commission on its findings.
It is probably safe to conclude that Mr O'Leary's past jibes and insults certainly helped persuade rival carriers that 
this was a battle Ryanair should fight alone. In one extravagant publicity stunt he hired a second-world-war tank and 
drove up to the front of Luton airport, home of EasyJet, his main rival.
Mr O'Leary likes to project an image as the common man's capitalist. Apart from his country house and 
prizewinning beef herd, his personal lifestyle is fairly modest. He likes to play football with his pilots. It is not 
unknown for him to spend his Sundays helping out the baggage handlers at Dublin airport.
For all his bonhomie with the workers, he has no time for unions and has even less truck with government ministers 
who get in his way. He had particularly bad relations with the former Irish transport minister, Mary O'Rourke: one 
notorious advertisement attacking the government's airports policy depicted her sitting in the bath playing with trains 
and aircraft.
That Mr O'Leary still relishes his "cheeky chappie" role was evident last year when it was discovered he had 
obtained a Dublin taxi licence in order to use his chauffeur-driven car in bus lanes and beat the city traffic. He said: 
"If I like to drink and I want to buy a pub, I'm free to buy a pub as long as I do so with my after-tax money in Ireland. 
Last time I checked this, as long as I paid my taxes, I'm free to do with my money what I like."
This relentless seeking of publicity sometimes backfires, as when he was sued by a Dublin housewife, the airline's 
millionth passenger, after the company reneged on a commitment to give her free tickets for life.
Ryanair talks of disaster, but the low-cost revolution flies on: AIRLINES: The no-frills carrier has lost its battle 
over subsidies at Belgium 's Charleroi airp....
In finding in the passenger's favour Justice Peter Kelly concurred with her claims that Mr O'Leary had been "hostile, 
bullying and aggressive" in his treatment of her. Mr O'Leary had been expected to settle out of court. But instead he 
took a combative line, insisting there had been no contract.
Mr O'Leary was marketing manager when the original deal was set up in 1988 and the publicity stunt was largely 
his initiative.

From Mr Richard Dyer.
Sir, It is hardly surprising that Michael O'Leary is so critical of the European Commission ruling on his Charleroi 
operation ("Ryanair's rivals welcome Brussels decision", February 4). 
The low-cost airline business model largely depends on the continuation of state subsidies and tax breaks, 
including zero-rated aviation fuel and value added tax exemption.
Aviation is the fastest-growing cause of the world's most pressing environmental problem, climate change. 
Emissions from projected expansion in the UK up to 2010 will wipe out the savings made by other sectors of the 
economy under the government's plans to tackle climate change. Without the subsidies and tax breaks the industry 
would still grow, but in a more sustainable manner.
The Commission's ruling merely scratches the surface of this problem. The government's plans for airport 
expansion are based on demand forecasts that assume flights will remain cheap. What we urgently need is more 
action on national, European and international levels to tackle these market distortions.
Thanks to the European Commission, we will now have fairer competition between carriers. The next step needed 
is fair treatment of the sector in relation to other industries.

Sir, Ryanair's Brussels-bashing before and after Tuesday's state aid decision by the European Commission in the 
Charleroi airport case is a clear example of how not to lobby in the European Union.
Public disrespect for the Commission's authority and expertise makes it difficult to build the dialogue and trust 
needed to come to a satisfactory settlement. It is not that "Eurocrats" are over-sensitive but they are suspicious of 
those who seek to score political points before a case is closed.
Other illustrious companies have had to learn this lesson the hard way. When dealing with the Commission egos 
should be left at the gate and public relations managers bumped off the passenger list.

The Commission could take "a number of weeks" to publish its full report, the Belgian government would then have 
60 days to respond with proposals as to how it would comply with the ruling that some of the illegal subsidies paid 
to Ryanair must be recovered from the airline. Kevin Done

Spotted yesterday among the glitzy shops on Brussels' Avenue Louise: a determined-looking, well-dressed Loyola 
de Palacio, EU transport commissioner, who this week ruled against low-cost airline Ryanair.
Was the Spaniard picking up something fun to wear on a weekend break? Booking a cheap flight to somewhere 
nice?
Observer's man with the sun-cream thinks that is probably unlikely. Palacio, 53, famously works all hours - her day 
started yesterday with a 7.30am Belgian radio interview - and "doesn't do weekends". Nor has she ever flown 
Ryanair.
But a Palacio aide says she has flown on a low-cost airline and would not rule out taking advantage of the Irish 
carrier's special offers. And remember: when announcing her Ryanair decision Palacio wore a jacket with patches 
on the sleeves - indicating either that she is happy to elbow aside opponents (Michael O'Leary?), or pays close 
attention to where her money goes.

Samy Meziane knows about the ups-and-downs of the airline industry. He had to move to Charleroi airport two 
years ago after losing his previous job with Sabena when the Belgian national carrier went bankrupt.
Inevitably, Mr Meziane, a ground operations instructor, is worried about history repeating itself. He said yesterday's 
decision by the European Commission to sanction Ryanair, the airline that accounts for almost all of Charleroi 
airport's business, flies against economic common sense.
"I can tell you that Sabena, and for that matter all the airlines I know, had to rely on subsidies at some point, so why 
are the European authorities suddenly waking up and attacking the one airline which has actually helped improve a 
region?"
Ryanair's arrival at Charleroi in 1997 and its decision to transform a small and disregarded airport into a European 
hub has proved a blessing for an industrial city hit by the gradual collapse of its traditional coal and steel activities.
Last year the airport welcomed 1.8m passengers, compared with 773,500 in 2001 and just 41,000 in 1995. 
Ryanair's exponential growth has added 700 jobs directly and helped create a further 2,600 among suppliers and in 
other sectors, according to a recent study by the university of Liege.
"Politicians keep producing new plans to create jobs but then they punish a company which has provided lifeblood 
to Charleroi," said Antonio Soletto, who found a job at the airport news-stand after almost a year of unemployment.
While most of the passengers at the airport yesterday were clutching Rome city guides or looking forward to visiting 
friends in Glasgow, Ryanair has also helped promote business between the Charleroi region and other parts of 
Europe.
Jean-Bernard Hemroulle, owner of Aqua Passion, a small Belgian company that supplies fish for garden ponds, 
was on his way to Carcassonne on a one-day trip to a local carp farm.
Workers fear a reversal of fortune in revived Charleroi
"If the flight hadn't been so cheap, I wouldn't have gone that far to see what fish I might add to my stock," he said.
Although Ryanair said yesterday it would need to scale back its flight operations following the Commission's ruling, 
Laurent Jossart, managing director of Charleroi airport, argued that the airport "has demonstrated it can perfectly 
handle 2m passengers and this credibility means we could find alternatives even in a worse-case Ryanair 
scenario".
Still, local officials warned that the dispute over Ryanair's subsidies was likely to prove a political hot potato in a 
year of regional and European elections in Belgium. It also highlighted rivalries between Belgian regions, since the 
initial complaint against Ryanair was filed by Brussels airport.
Despite the employment benefits brought by Ryanair to Charleroi, the low-cost carrier has had an uneasy 
relationship with local trade unions because of its application of Irish labour legislation rather than stricter Belgian 
rules.
Last December, a Charleroi court decided to seek an opinion from the European Court of Justice following a labour 
union complaint against Ryanair's dismissal of three employees.
The cabin-crew members were fired days before the end of their one-year trial period but unions argued Ryanair 
should have complied with Belgian legislation which limits a trial period to six months.
"Ryanair has of course been great news for Charleroi, but at the same time it has worried us to see a company 
being allowed to avoid completely Belgian labour rules," said Tony Demonte, a trade union official, who believes the 
final ruling will set an important legal precedent for EU labour legislation.

Among the attractions around Charleroi listed on the Belgian steel town's tourist website are a photography 
museum, some castles and 62 coal slagheaps. As fine as they are, it is doubtful they would generate much traffic to 
its airport without subsidies. 
The European Commission's ruling against aid to Ryanair to fly to state-owned Charleroi accepts that. But it also 
recognises that a line has to be drawn somewhere to prevent distortions to market competition.
It says the incentives offered to Ryanair would have been legal if the state could achieve a fair return over a 
reasonable time - as a private operator would. The business case for the airport would also have to make sense 
without taking into account factors such as job creation. The Commission argues that Charleroi would not have had 
a hope of earning a fair return over even 10 years, given the degree of Ryanair's incentives. The airline argues that 
incentives were offered to rivals and that other private sector airports offer greater discounts.
The extent of the fallout Ryanair may suffer still remains clouded in fog. The final penalties still have to be assessed 
and tested in legal battles. However, they are not likely to be hugely material. As for the broader implications, if the 
support EasyJet and Virgin Express have given the ruling is any guide it is not likely to be the end of low-cost fares. 
Cheap weekend breaks should be safe.

Ryanair's angry reaction to the European Commission's ruling against its Charleroi airport deal won little support 
elsewhere in the aviation industry yesterday, with rival low-cost carriers and full service airlines welcoming the 
decision.
Investors, who fled Ryanair stock last week when the airline issued its first profits warning and painted the blackest 
outlook for the Brussels ruling, also regained some of their nerve.
The Ryanair share price, which fell by 31 per cent in a single day's trading last week, rose by 6 per cent or 29 cents 
yesterday to close at Euros 4.95.
Chris Avery, aviation analyst at JP Morgan, said the Brussels ruling did "not fundamentally challenge Ryanair's 
business model".
It would cut operating profit margins from 25 per cent to about 22 per cent, but Ryanair would "still be the most 
profitable airline in the world," he said.
Andrew Lobbenberg, ABN Amro aviation analyst, said he did not expect air fares to rise as a result of the Charleroi 
ruling, but said Ryanair profits would fall.
The airline was already trying, however, to rebuild its fares through "stealth taxes," he said, such as higher credit 
card fees and last week's 50p wheelchair surcharge.
Ryanair imposed this levy after losing a court case in the UK over discrimination in charging for wheelchair services.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, claimed the Charleroi state aid ruling would "equally affect" many other 
deals across Europe, such as EasyJet arrangements at Berlin Schonefeld, Toulouse and Marseille airports, 
Lufthansa at Leipzig and Munich and FlyBE at Perpignan, Bergerac and La Rochelle.
Ryanair 's rivals welcome Brussels decision BAN ON SUBSIDIES:
EasyJet immediately undermined the Ryanair case, however, by claiming that the Commission decision was 
"supportive" of the low-cost airline industry.
It said it believed the Commission's intention to use the ruling as a basis for uniform guidelines on airport landing 
charges and tariffs across the European Union would "help clarify arrangements between airports and airlines, be 
they low cost, national flag carriers or charter".
It expressed support for Brussels' plan to "authorise variations to published tariffs at publicly-owned airports 
providing the procedure is transparent and does not lead to any discrimination". Ray Webster, EasyJet chief 
executive, said the ruling was "good news for Europe's airlines as it removes a very substantial degree of 
uncertainty that has been hanging over European aviation for some time".
An EasyJet spokesman said the airline was "confident" its 20-year deal with Berlin Schonefeld airport signed last 
November would "stand up to scrutiny".
Flights are due to start from the new base in May. EasyJet said it had taken legal advice on the deal and had 
consulted the Commission. "If anybody wants to complain about Schonefeld, bring it on. They know who to 
complain to. We don't see a problem with it."
FlyBE believed that none of its existing deals with French airports would fall under the Charleroi ruling.
The Association of European Airlines, which chiefly represents the traditional flag carriers, said the Commission's 
judgment was "a first but important step towards a level playing field for European airlines".
AEA members have been under heavy attack from Ryanair for several years for charging what the Irish airline 
claims are extortionately high fares. The AEA took the opportunity yesterday to hit back.
Ulrich Schulte Strathaus, AEA secretary-general, said the Brussels ruling showed that "the fact that taxpayers' 
money is being used to redirect business from one group of private companies - the airlines at Brussels National 
airport - to another private company, namely Ryanair, is simply unacceptable".

Ryanair launched a blistering attack on the European Commission yesterday, describing Brussels' landmark ban on 
airport subsidies granted to the Irish no-frills carrier as a "disaster" for consumers, low-cost airlines and publicly-
owned airports.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, warned that the ruling would trigger a wave of complaints and legal 
challenges to deals similar to the one it had with Belgium's Charleroi airport.
It could lead operators to abandon routes and airports rather than face higher airport charges, and could hasten the 
privatisation of publicly owned airports.
But most rival airlines shunned the stance taken by Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, saying the future of the sector 
was not in danger. EasyJet, its biggest no-frills competitor, said the Commission decision was "supportive" of the 
low-cost airline industry. EasyJet said it had taken legal advice on its recent 20-year deal at Berlin's publicly owned 
Schonefeld airport and had consulted the Commission. "If anybody wants to complain about Schonefeld, bring it on. 
We don't see a problem with it."
Ryanair's shares fell by 31 per cent in one day last week after a profits warning from the company compounded 
fears about the Brussels ruling. Yesterday they rose 6.2 per cent or 29 cents to close at Euros 4.95.
Ryanair was told that the reduction in landing charges and ground-handling fees it received at Charleroi, as well as 
other benefits, were in principle incompatible with EU state-aid law.
Ryanair chief blasts EU ruling: No-frills airline says subsidy ban will be a 'disaster': * O'Leary's 'heavy-handed' 
criticism of probe 'has not helped': * Rival....
The Commission intends to use the ruling as the basis for guidelines setting out what incentives airports can use to 
attract carriers. Benefits such as marketing had to be linked to the opening of new routes, and should not exceed 50 
per cent of the costs or run for longer than five years after a new route was opened.
Loyola de Palacio, EU transport commissioner, stressed that the decision would leave the bulk of the payments to 
Ryanair intact. She refused to be drawn on the magnitude of the repayment order but cited estimates that Ryanair 
might have to repay as little as 25 per cent of the Euros 15m subsidies it received over the past three years.
"This legal decision is well balanced: it brings greater transparency to 'low-cost' operations, which are very clearly 
what consumers want, while also ensuring equitable conditions of competition for all airlines," said Ms de Palacio.
But she accepted there would be an impact on consumers, saying the subsidy ban on Ryanair would add between 
Euros 6 and Euros 8 to a return ticket from Charleroi.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would appeal against the ruling.
His criticism of the investigation may have added to Ryanair's difficulties, Commission officials said. "It is widely felt 
that his heavy-handed approach has not helped his cause," said one.
There was some criticism of the ruling inside the Commission, with Britain's Neil Kinnock, Italy's Mario Monti, 
Ireland's David Byrne and the Netherlands' Frits Bolkestein arguing for further time to analyse the ruling. They won 
some small concessions but failed to persuade a majority to postpone the decision. Rivals welcome decision, Page

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, in the style of his low-cost airline, did not land directly at the European Commission 
yesterday. He was a little way away, at Brussels' Crowne Plaza hotel, and communication with the "European 
quarter" over subsidies for Europe's regional airports seemed difficult.
In fact, O'Leary's message hardly got through, and as Observer noted last week he now has luxury, first-class 
status among business leaders who failed to understand Brussels.
Surely Ryanair could have built on the support from fellow free-market travellers (competition commissioner Mario 
Monti, internal markets commissioner Frits Bolkestein, Irish commissioner David Byrne, etc)?
O'Leary's sallies were frequent and cheap: "Are we the good guys? Absolutely. Are the Commission the bad guys? 
They are the evil empire."
But refreshments were scant and there was certainly no fancy multilingual service - which might have helped get his 
arguments across. Asked for a comment in French, O'Leary explained he spoke only "a petit peu and that was the 
petit peu". Well, it shut him up for a moment ...

From Mr Stephen Brown.
Sir, You conclude ("Airport competition", January 30) that the European Commission should take account of 
"possible positive effects on the regional economy" when evaluating public subsidies to airlines. 
Presumably you believe that there is an external benefit resulting from Ryanair's operations on the basis of which 
local authorities should be permitted to offer subsidies, resulting in more efficient economic decisions.
At Ryanair's main operating base at Stansted the airline imposes huge environmental and economic costs on the 
local communities.
It would be a logical extension of your argument to permit local authorities around Stansted to impose charges on 
Ryanair to offset these external costs.
If Ryanair had to pay the full external costs of its operations and consumer taxes in line with other leisure industries, 
its business model would probably not be viable. This is the real public policy issue that needs to be addressed with 
regard to the airline industry.

Even before yesterday's decision, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary had denounced the European Commission as 
"Communist". Strangely, the red threat was on peoples' minds yesterday at the European parliament.
The European People's party was drawing up a resolution urging a ban on "leading figures of the former communist 
regimes" at EU institutions and from political groups in the parliament, "to prevent the revival of totalitarian 
Communist regimes".
Unsurprisingly, the idea for the resolution - to be discussed at a Brussels congress this week - came from EPP 
politicians in eastern European countries about to join the EU. But it was causing grief yesterday: was everyone on 
the political right really untainted? Would there be some kind of "truth commission"? Wasn't the idea half-cocked?
Never mind, O'Leary doesn't get hung up on politics. Give those new EU member states free flights all round ...

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair is expecting to launch an appeal against the European Commission's judgement in the 
Brussels South Charleroi airport investigation.
In a ruling to be released this week, the Commission is expected to find the airport's owner, Belgium's Wallonia 
region, guilty of breaking state aid rules in its efforts to attract Ryanair, which established a base at Charleroi in 
February 2001. Ryanair is expected to be ordered to repay "tens of millions of euros" in subsidised landing and 
handling fees, says the airline's director of policy, Jim Callaghan.
The airline's woes were compounded last week when its shares lost one-third of their value on publication of the 
carrier's first profit warning. It may also defer some of the 100 Boeing 737-800s due over the next eight years as it 
ramps back growth plans.
The airline has forecast a 10% drop in full-year profits to [euro]215 million ($273 million), compared with [euro]239 
million last year and its share price fell by more than 30% to [euro]4.70 in one day last Wednesday.
Speaking to Flight Internationalin Brussels ahead of this week's Charleroi ruling, Callaghan said he expected the 
deal to be found illegal in four areas. Handling fees, estimated to be c1 per passenger, and discounted landing fees 
are both deemed to have been delivered below cost. Equally, the EC finds start-up assistance given to the airline 
and subsequent marketing support to breach European Union competition rules.
Callaghan says the airline will formally issue an appeal within two months. The EC is expected to launch new 
guidelines for government-owned airports' use of public funds in attracting airlines in parallel to announcing the 
Ryanair decision (Flight International, 13-19 January). Callaghan says this proves the EC ruling is based on flawed 
Ryanair to appeal against EC Charleroi probe ruling; Irish carrier required to repay millions of euros after 
decision on breach of state aid laws
regulation. "How can the EC say that parts need to be repaid while admitting that no guidelines currently exist?"he 
says.
Ryanair says it will review its operations at Charleroi and could be forced to pull out of this and other publicly owned 
airports. The Walloon government says it may push ahead with a privatisation effort of Charleroi ahead of the 2005 
plan, as the rules do not apply to private airports.

Analysts have warned that the £300 million ($550 million) cost- cutting plan rolled out by British Airways last week 
will not solve its problems unless it can also boost its share of the lucrative European business market.
"Although long-haul premium traffic has improved, they must focus on improving their short-haul business," says 
independent airline analyst Chris Tarry.
With increased competition in the European market against established and low-cost carriers having caused "a 
fundamental change in the revenue stream", Tarry says BA needs a much lower cost base to compete: "It remains 
to be seen if these cuts will be enough." Productivity at BA has improved over the past four years, but still remains 
well behind the figures for its low-cost rivals EasyJet and Ryanair (see table).
BA plans to cut £300 million in staff costs over the next two years, saying the cuts will bring its margins up and put 
the airline "in a position to prosper". But with traffic rising, especially in the lucrative long-haul premium sector, it 
may be difficult to convince staff that more cuts are necessary.
The cuts are planned for the next two years, to be completed by March 2006, and will see the airline trim its overall 
employee costs by 14% from their current level of £2.1 billion. BA says it is "committed to" trade union demands 
that there are no compulsory redundancies.
Tarry warns that negotiations will face new problems as business picks up and staff see the share price rising. With 
traffic up, "the balance of power will shift towards the unions," he adds. "The cost of a day's disruption becomes 
higher as things improve."
The airline refuses to say how many jobs could eventually go. The Transport & General Workers' Union points out 
that an earlier round of cuts, the Future Size and Shape programme, saved £700 million at the expense of 13,000 
jobs.
Analysts warn that BA pruning is not enough
Reductions in the latest round will fall mainly on headquarters and administrative staff: the carrier says it will cut 
30% of administrative staff costs and 15% of "operational" staff costs (pilots and cabin crew, ground crew, and 
customer services staff) --putting less of the new burden on the people who could more readily damage the airline 
by going on a sudden strike.

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair is expecting to launch an appeal against the European Commission's judgement in the 
Brussels South Charleroi airport investigation.
In a ruling to be released this week, the Commission is expected to find the airport's owner, Belgium's Wallonia 
region, guilty of breaking state aid rules in its efforts to attract Ryanair, which established a base at Charleroi in 
February 2001. Ryanair is expected to be ordered to repay "tens of millions of euros" in subsidised landing and 
handling fees, says the airline's director of policy, Jim Callaghan.
The airline's woes were compounded last week when its shares lost one-third of their value on publication of the 
carrier's first profit warning. It may also defer some of the 100 Boeing 737-800s due over the next eight years as it 
ramps back growth plans.
The airline has forecast a 10% drop in full-year profits to c215 million ($273 million), compared with c239 million last 
year and its share price fell by more than 30% to c4.70 in one day last Wednesday.
Speaking to Flight International in Brussels ahead of this week's Charleroi ruling, Callaghan said he expected the 
deal to be found illegal in four areas. Handling fees, estimated to be c1 per passenger, and discounted landing fees 
are both deemed to have been delivered below cost. Equally, the EC finds start-up assistance given to the airline 
and subsequent marketing support to breach European Union competition rules.
Callaghan says the airline will formally issue an appeal within two months. The EC is expected to launch new 
guidelines for government-owned airports' use of public funds in attracting airlines in parallel to announcing the 
Ryanair decision (Flight International, 13-19 January). Callaghan says this proves the EC ruling is based on flawed 
regulation. "How can the EC say that parts need to be repaid while admitting that no guidelines currently exist?" he 
says.
Ryanair says it will review its operations at Charleroi and could be forced to pull out of this and other publicly owned 
airports. The Walloon government says it may push ahead with a privatisation effort of Charleroi ahead of the 2005

Pat Cox, the Irishman who presides over the European Parliament, yesterday added his voice to the growing 
number of European policy makers expressing concern over today's landmark state-aid ruling against Ryanair.
The Irish low-cost carrier faces a potentially damaging ruling, which will ban the company from receiving the vast 
majority of benefits it was given by Belgian authorities in return for choosing Charleroi, south of Brussels, as one of 
its hub airports.
Although the European Commission has insisted that the ruling will not be nearly as menacing to the company, and 
Europe's aviation industry as Ryanair claims, there are concerns that the Brussels regulator is going too far.
Mr Cox said: "I am concerned that (the) decision could have wide-ranging implications which go far beyond the 
specific case of the use of Charleroi airport by Ryanair. For this reason, I have written to the European Commission 
asking for reassurances that an assessment has been made of the possible knock-on effects and implications that 
a precedent set by this particular case might have for regional airports, regional development, consumer 
preferences and service provision."
His views follow closely the arguments put forward by Ryanair, which says a negative ruling would lead to airlines 
abandoning small, regional airports and set off a round of tit-for-tat legal battles between carrier and airports.
Such fears stem from the Commission's determination to use today's ruling as a basis for guidelines setting out 
what kind of incentives airports may use to attract carriers' business. Although these will only be published in spring 
this year, the uncertainty over the potential impact of these guidelines has already unnerved the sector.
Mr Cox added: "It is important to ensure that the decision taken does not lead to unforeseen, unplanned and 
potentially unwelcome side effects in different regions across Europe."
Similar concerns had already been expressed by the Assembly of European Regions, which warned that many 
regions in Europe had benefited from Ryanair's decision to pick them as locations.

Analysts have warned that the [pounds sterling]300 million ($550 million) cost- cutting plan rolled out by British 
Airways last week will not solve its problems unless it can also boost its share of the lucrative European business 
market.
"Although long-haul premium traffic has improved, they must focus on improving their short-haul business," says 
independent airline analyst Chris Tarry.
With increased competition in the European market against established and low-cost carriers having caused"a 
fundamental change in the revenue stream", Tarry says BAneeds a much lower cost base to compete:"It remains to 
be seen if these cuts will be enough." Productivity at BAhas improved over the past four years, but still remains well 
behind the figures for its low-cost rivals EasyJet and Ryanair (see table).
BA plans to cut [pounds sterling]300 million in staff costs over the next two years, saying the cuts will bring its 
margins up and put the airline"in a position to prosper".But with traffic rising, especially in the lucrative long-haul 
premium sector, it may be difficult to convince staff that more cuts are necessary.
The cuts are planned for the next two years, to be completed by March 2006, and will see the airline trim its overall 
employee costs by 14% from their current level of [pounds sterling]2.1 billion. BA says it is "committed to" trade 
union demands that there are no compulsory redundancies.
Tarry warns that negotiations will face new problems as business picks up and staff see the share price rising. With 
traffic up, "the balance of power will shift towards the unions,"he adds. "The cost of a day's disruption becomes 
higher as things improve."
The airline refuses to say how many jobs could eventually go. The Transport &General Workers' Union points out 
that an earlier round of cuts, the Future Size and Shape programme, saved [pounds sterling]700 million at the 
expense of 13,000 jobs.
Reductions in the latest round will fall mainly on headquarters and administrative staff: the carrier says it will cut 
30%of administrative staff costs and 15% of "operational" staff costs (pilots and cabin crew, ground crew, and 
markets Analysts warn that BA pruning is not enough.

When Stelios Haji-Ioannou stepped down as chairman of EasyJet in 2002, the move was driven by a recognition 
that the skills of an entrepreneur are different from those required for running an established company. It might be 
tempting to conclude that the same should apply to Ryanair after last week's profit warning. 
But there are good reasons why shareholders should not rush to oust Michael O'Leary as Ryanair chief executive, 
despite concerns over his abrasive style in dealing with regulators, customers and wheelchair users.
Mr O'Leary is a much more hands-on manager than Mr Haji-Ioannou was at EasyJet. He has been a driving force 
behind Ryanair's aggression in cutting costs and negotiating with suppliers. Mr O'Leary also appears not to be 
wedded to growth for its own sake, despite his ambitions. Last week's warning was prompted by indigestion after 50 
per cent plus annual growth rates in capacity over the last two years. Yet this expansion was probably justified with 
a view to establishing market dominance in continental Europe in the face of emerging competition. Mr O'Leary has 
also signalled that the rate of expansion is expected to slow to a more modest 20 per cent from May onwards. The 
colourful chief executive is never going to stray far from the headlines. While that has a value in building a brand, 
there will come a time when a smoother management style will be more appropriate. But given Mr O'Leary's track 
record in value creation, it is too early to switch pilots.

The European Commission will tomorrow launch a vigorous defence of its landmark anti-subsidy decision against 
Ryanair, arguing the Irish low-cost carrier will be let off much lighter than its managers claim.
Ryanair, however, yesterday threatened to "initiate state aid cases and complaints against every other airline flying 
into every state airport which offers concessions and discounts."
The Commission will argue that Ryanair will only be asked to pay back small amounts of the subsidies it received, 
and that the value of the payments that will be cleared easily outstrips the value of the benefits that will be declared 
illegal.
But that version of events was attacked by Ryanair, which insists that the decision will have devastating effects not 
just for the carrier but for the entire European aviation sector. "This decision is a disaster from start to finish," Jim 
Callaghan, Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs, said.
In a statement yesterday, Ryanair said the ruling would reverse 20 years of deregulation and increased competition 
in the European air travel market.
The disagreement over how to interpret the Commission's verdict cannot distract from the fact that the draft 
decision leaves intact only few of the benefits granted to Ryanair by Belgian authorities in return for setting up a 
base in Charleroi, just south of Brussels.
While the reduction in landing charges and ground handling fees are declared completely incompatible with 
European state aid law, the decision also imposes tight conditions on other benefits. These must be linked to the 
opening of new routes, may not exceed 50 per cent of the overall value of the costs and may not run for longer than 
three years.
People close to the case say that the Commission will not quantify the amount Ryanair has to pay back. Instead, it 
will leave it to the Belgian authorities to calculate the sum that has been granted without justification and recoup it.
Ryanair threat to rivals' deals ahead of ruling TRANSPORT:
However, a Commission official who asked to remain unnamed, said that Ryanair would be asked to pay back 
about Euros 7m (Pounds 4.87m) at the most, though that figure could be as low as Euros 2.5m. He added that this 
was much less than the overall value of the benefits received over the last three years - the period under scrutiny.
Mr Callaghan dismissed these calculations, but refused to be drawn into a debate over the level of possible 
repayments. "The amounts in this case are not the issue. For a start, there should not be any repayments at all. But 
the real problem is that this decision is going to prevent public airports from using the same kind of tools that are 
being used by private airports."
Ryanair has launched a fierce last-minute lobbying effort to soften the blow, writing to all 20 EU commissioners 
urging them to rethink the decision. It says a negative decision would force EU consumers to pay higher fares, 
inject uncertainty into the sector and lead to airlines abandoning regional airports.
It said the spotlight would now fall on other deals such as EasyJet's 20-year arrangement at Berlin's publicly owned 
Schonefeld airport, as well as discounted arrangements by EasyJet at Marseille and Toulouse, FlyBE at a number 
of French regional airports, and a number of German low fares airlines at publicly owned airports.
A negative ruling would also affect the discounted arrangements enjoyed by flag carriers including a six-year 
scheme under which Aer Lingus was opening 12 new routes from government airports in Dublin and Cork. The 
Euros 3.8m annual subsidy paid by Leipzig to Lufthansa would also be challenged.

There was a degree of Schadenfreude on show when Ryanair's share price fell after Michael O'Leary, the carrier's 
CEO, announced that it expected a 25% to 30% fall in yields for 2004. 
The Irish low-cost airline has always wanted to be respected, rather than loved, by both competitors and suppliers 
and many people felt it was about time Ryanair got its comeuppance. 
Unfortunately for its competitors, the truth is that stock markets - and, yes, even journalists - often over react. 
Ryanair has certainly got a challenge ahead restoring yields, and may have to revaluate its way of dealing with 
airports, but this is not the beginning of the end for the airline - or for other low-cost carriers. 
To start with, Ryanair is still growing; its traffic for the last quarter of 2003 went up 54%, although the airline 
achieved this by cutting the average fare by 11%. It is still dedicated to low costs; its unit cost fell 8% in the same 
quarter, and it still has one of the best airline management teams in the world. 
Like other fast-growing airlines, including flag carriers such as Emirates and Qatar, Ryanair has got the problem of 
managing yields while adding capacity. Although unlike Emirates and Qatar, which are not trying to offer low fares 
to all customers, Ryanair is also trying to lower yields on some routes to hurt competitors). 
O'Leary's announcement is simply a blip in the airline's growth - after all, it still says that its profit margin will remain 
above 20%.
Ryanair will continue to grow and, although it is hard to see how it can keep cutting costs at the same rate, it will no 
doubt keep lean.
Low-cost airlines are here to stay. Even though many flag carriers have reinvented themselves as low-costs, newer 
start-ups will still have many advantages.
There are also huge growth opportunities. Airlines such as AirAsia in Malaysia and SkyEurope in Slovakia have 
successfully translated the low-cost model to new markets. The low-cost model is changing. EasyJet has a very 
different strategy to Ryanair; jetBlue is very different to Southwest.
In fact, the people who should be most worried are those who rejoiced in the news.

A number of European low-cost airlines have joined forces to create a new lobbying group, the European Low 
Fares Association (Elfa).
One key campaign area for the association will be state aid. This comes after the European Union's (EU) decision 
to fine Ryanair (EURO)15 million for receiving subsidies from Charleroi airport. 
Airline members say the association will represent the interests of all low-cost airlines in the European Union and 
argue that regulators have not taken into account the interests of low-costs. 
Eleven airlines have formed the association, including Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, but a number of 
airlines have not joined. 
"Easyjet are not going to join Elfa, Leprechaun or whatever it's called," says Toby Nicol, head of public affairs at 
easyJet in Luton. "The point is to get thing things done - not just issue press releases."
EasyJet says that it is not convinced that the association will represent the views of all its members and will be 
dominated by Ryanair. 
"If we were to join it I reckon we would just spend most of the time arguing with Ryanair over what is and what isn't 
an association problem," says Nicol. 
He adds: "We have got much better things to do - such as running an airline."
Meanwhile, the EU has ruled that the reduction in landing charges and ground-handling fees Ryanair received from 
Charleroi airport, broke state-aid rules.
The EU will draw up new guidelines setting out what incentives airports can use to attract carriers. It has also

damaging to the European low-cost business. 
Low-costs come together
A passengers' rights bill would make the no frills airlines pay for meal and drinks even when consumers are not 
charged for them as part of their service. It would also force budget carriers to compensate passengers for 
cancelled flights - even if the carriers are not responsible for the cancellation. 
Herbert Euller, spokesman for Elfa, says: "This could have a devastating effect on low-fare cost structure."

A number of European low-cost airlines have joined forces to create a new lobbying group, the European Low 
Fares Association (Ella).
One key campaign area for the association will be state aid. This comes after the European Union's (EU) decision 
to fine Ryanair 15 [euro] million for receiving subsidies from Charleroi airport.
Airline members say the association will represent the interests of all low-cost airlines in the European Union and 
argue that regulators have not taken into account the interests of low-costs.
Eleven airlines have formed the association, including Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, but a number of 
airlines have not joined.
"Easyjet are not going to join Ella, Leprechaun or whatever it's called," says Toby Nicol, head of public affairs at 
easyJet in Luton. "The point is to get thing things done--not just issue press releases."
EasyJet says that it is not convinced that the association will represent the views of all its members and will be 
dominated by Ryanair.
"If we were to join it I reckon we would just spend most of the time arguing with Ryanair over what is and what isn't 
an association problem," says Nicol.
He adds: "We have got much better things to do--such as running an airline."
Meanwhile, the EU has ruled that the reduction in landing charges and ground-handling fees Ryanair received from 
Charleroi airport, broke state-aid rules.
The EU will draw up new guidelines setting out what incentives airports can use to attract carriers. It has also 
announced that it will review a deal between the airline and Pau Airport.

Highlight: As Ryanair has discovered, the European Union (EU) is watching airlines closely. So airlines in the 10 
accession countries should pay close attention to new rules. By Justin Benson, head of White & Case's London 
asset finance practice, and Mark Powell, a partner in the firm's EU practice in Brussels.
Body
On May 1 the European Union (EU) will welcome 10 new member states in the largest enlargement in its more than 
50-year history. The accession of Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, 
the Slovak Republic and Slovenia will have a profound impact on the European aviation industry.
While it may prove to be the industry's biggest challenge to date, the 10 mostly eastern European countries joining 
the EU will equally provide manufacturers, operators and lenders with unrivalled opportunities. With more than 130 
carriers and a network of over 450 airports, the enlarged EU will not only open up new markets for the operators, 
but also with many operators within the accession countries still flying outdated Soviet-era equipment, it should also 
boost demand for new aircraft.
When the new members join the EU, the law contained in the EU Treaties will become an integral part of the 
national laws of the new member states. For the aviation sector this will mean that the new member states will be 
governed by EU legislation and no longer by bilateral agreements dealing with the issues covered by that 
legislation. For the airlines of the new member states, this will also mean full exposure to the Third Package, 
unrestricted competition, limitations on state aid, air service agreements on a collective European basis and 
inclusion within The Single European Sky. While initially this may prove to be a testing period for some airlines, a 
larger market can only benefit carriers of both existing member states and accession countries in the longer term.
So what are the regulations and restrictions that the new operators will be subject to on joining the EU?
An end to state aid
Although not just restricted to the aviation industry, some of the most high-profile state-aid cases recently have 
concerned airlines, including Alitalia, Aer Lingus, Olympic Airways and Ryanair. Furthermore, the issue is likely to 
gain even greater prominence on enlargement. The commission officials anticipate a 40% increase in the state-aid 
workload as a result of EU enlargement.
The accession will bring into the EU many state-owned airlines which are accustomed to receiving support or 
subsidies from their governments. Once within the EU, these airlines will be subject to the general prohibition that is 
Opening up Europe
placed on member states on giving aid that would distort competition. In this regard, to avoid being classified as 
state aid, any support offered by member states will have to satisfy the "market economy investor principle" - in 
other words, the terms on which the aid was offered by the state to the airline would have been acceptable to a 
private investor operating under the constraints of the market.Alternatively, the support measure would need to be 
notified to and approved by the European Commission (EC). It is the role of the EC to investigate whether the 
measure has been made on bona fide commercial terms and is in its nature something that would be available in 
the open market. The whole amount is regarded as state aid if it transpires that the financial support would not have 
been available from a commercial entity. With such stringent restrictions, the need for flag carriers to go into the 
market to seek private funding is inevitable, which should provide valuable business for the banks. 
However, it should be noted that while generally the prohibition is inflexible, there are some limited circumstances 
where aid is permitted, and it is to these exceptions that the new accession countries will no doubt look.
For example, in many cases an exemption to the prohibition on state aid has been granted where it has been 
shown that the aid would result in the promotion of certain economic activities. This has allowed several carriers to 
receive state aid as part of a restructuring programme. However, such exemptions are only permitted within strict 
guidelines; for example, the restructuring programme must be capable of restoring the airline's health so that it can, 
within a reasonable period, be expected to operate viably, normally without further aid; or the aid should not enable 
the airline to engage in anti-competitive activities, nor be detrimental to the implementation of the EU liberalization 
rules in the air transport sector. Under such circumstances, the EC is only likely to allow restructuring aid in 
exceptional cases and under very stringent conditions. The carriers which will therefore be able to rely on 
governmental help will be few and far between.
Another recent development which may have an impact on aviation within the EU is the ruling by the EC that certain 
incentives received by Ryanair at its Belgian hub of Charleroi from the regional authorities were illegal. Although 
some of the incentives were permissible as part of regional development support for the airport, the airline has still 
been ordered to repay about £3 million of the subsidies. As the ruling was issued as Airfinance Journal went to 
press, it is too early fully to digest its implications. Nevertheless, smaller airports - which are often government-
owned - have in the past been able to use these incentives (such as reductions in landing fees) to their 
considerable advantage in generating extra traffic.
These incentives have undeniably been very successful in attracting a large number of passengers to what were 
previously underused airports, providing an economic boost not only to the airports but also to the surrounding 
regions. For example, the presence of Ryanair at Charleroi is estimated to have boosted the Walloon economy by 
about £30 million a year. If the low-cost carriers withdraw from these regions the implications for regional 
development within the EU may extend well beyond those of the specific case of Charleroi.
Increased competition
On May 1 the new competition law enforcement procedures will come into force. With the adoption of Regulation 
1/2003, replacing Regulation 17/62, the EU has sought to modernize the way in which Articles 81 and 82 are 
implemented. By doing so, the EU took a major step towards adapting the 40-year old antitrust procedural rules to 
the demands of a Union of 25 member states.
Although numerous articles could be written about the changes, the main difference will be that it will no longer be 
possible for parties to file restrictive agreements with the EC in view of obtaining an individual exemption. 
Consequently immunity from fines pending the EC decision will no longer be available. Instead, parties will have to 
make their own assessment of whether their intended agreement fulfills the conditions in Article 81(3) of the Treaty. 
This will prove to be a particularly tricky task in respect of cooperation agreements such as airline alliances. As 
such, a certain degree of legal uncertainty is inevitable.
A key aspect of the reforms is to intensify cooperation between the Commission and National Competition 
Authorities. In the area of aviation, this will involve a specialized working group exclusively dedicated to the air 
Opening up Europe
transport sector, mirroring what is already done for railways. This should ensure that the competition rules are 
applied consistently by member states.
Third Package
The Third Package is founded on three pillars that liberalize the licensing of carriers, the routes they can fly and the 
prices they can impose. On accession, the new member states will benefit from the full effect of this in the same 
way as the existing 15 member states do.
Licensing of air carriers: Council Regulation 2407/92. This provides that member states shall permit any EU carrier 
holding an operating licence granted pursuant to the regulation to exercise traffic rights within the EU.
Market access: Council Regulation 2408/92 on access for community air carriers to intra-community air routes. 
Under this regulation, access to routes between member states is unrestricted. Most importantly any airline holding 
a valid air operators' certificate in the EU cannot be prevented from operating on any route within the EU, including 
flights wholly within another country. On accession, the new member states will therefore for the first time have all 
the "air freedoms", including unrestricted access to cabotage routes (but, most importantly, subject to the availability 
of slots).
Fares and rates for air services: Council Regulation 2409/92. The basic effect of this regulation is freedom for EU 
carriers to set fares for scheduled, charter and cargo services.
Indeed, fares and rates for charter services (passengers and cargo) are not subject to any controls under the 
regulation. They are simply to be agreed freely between the contracting parties.
Open skies and the Single European Sky
Following a ruling from the European Court of Justice and the mandates given by the Council to the Commission, 
the EC is to negotiate on behalf of all member states the full range of aviation trade rules including, capacity, fares, 
frequency, routes, slot allocation, and airline security. It will be the new accession countries that are likely to benefit 
the most from this outcome. Individual European states have fewer airports and lower volumes of air traffic than 
larger nations such as the US. As a consequence, it is usual for that country to have fewer airports and lower 
volumes of air traffic, which in turn means a weaker bargaining position compared to that of a larger country. It is 
only through banding together that European states can most effectively optimize their shared potentials and the 
larger the number of states, the stronger the bargaining position will be.
With 10 new member states joining the EU there has never been a greater need to reform the outdated architecture 
of European air traffic control. While there has been a constant increase in air traffic control capacity in Europe 
since 1990, it is trailing behind the growth in air traffic.
The technical improvements made by Eurocontrol, the international organization for the safety of air navigation, 
have not been sufficient to reverse the trend and delays continue, costing airlines between (EURO)1.3 billion and 
(EURO)1.9 billion a year. With many of these delays occurring in central European countries, the very recent 
package of regulations (February 2, 2004) aimed at introducing common rules on the use of airspace throughout 
the EU are to be greatly welcomed.
The four new regulations when fully implemented will provide a wide ranging package including: the establishment 
of the Single Sky Committee ensuring the interests of all categories of airspace users are considered; rules 
establishing common requirements for the safe and efficient provision of air navigation services; the organization 
and use of airspace and interoperability within the European air transport management network.
Undoubtedly it will be the interoperability regulation that is likely to impact heaviest on the new member states as it 
aims to achieve harmonization between the different systems and associated procedures of the European air traffic 
management network. While the initiative may prove to be very ambitious, its application to all the member states, 
Opening up Europe
old and new, should provide a sound basis from which the issue of air delays and airspace congestion can be 
tackled.
The accession of the new member states to the EU could not come at a better time for the aviation industry. Hit by 
recession and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US, enlargement is likely to help the industry emerge from its 
worst downturn in years, providing not only new markets for carriers but also a stimulus for the manufacturers.
The coming months and years will certainly be challenging and not all carriers are likely to survive the rigours of a 
competitive market. Yet for those who do, the rewards should be substantial.

RBS Aviation Capital has confirmed its place as the one of the most active lenders in 2003 winning both operating 
leasing and straight debt deals with Continental, Ryanair, South African Airways, Qantas and Taca.
The bank will finance six 737-800s for Contintental through sale/leasebacks, as well as providing debt for four more. 
Four of the 10 aircraft were delivered in November and December with the rest due this year. 
South African Airways has mandated the bank to arrange sale/leasebacks on nine A320s and one A319 due for 
delivery in 2004 and 2005. RBS will also provide predelivery financing worth about $100 million for the aircraft.

Disabled passenger wins case against Ryanair

A disabled man has won his legal fight to have Ryanair's policy of charging for the use of wheelchairs at London 
Stansted airport declared discriminatory.
But the Irish low-cost airline immediately announced that it would appeal against yesterday's decision and said it 
would impose a 50p levy on all its passengers in the meantime to pay for the cost of providing wheelchair 
assistance at Stansted, Gatwick, Dublin and Shannon airports.
The ruling came only days after Ryanair announced its first profits warning. With the airline expected to carry almost 
24m passengers in the year to March, and even more next year, the levy should raise more than Pounds 12m in a 
full year.
The Disability Rights Commission said it would only cost about 2p a passenger to meet the cost of the service to 
move passengers needing a wheelchair from the check-in desk to the aircraft.
Ryanair rejected the commission's estimate but said it would keep the fee under review. The airline also said it 
wanted Mr Ross to have the service free, but the airport, in this case BAA, should pay, as did 80 of the 86 airports 
to which it flew in Europe.
Judge Crawford Lindsay, sitting in the Central London county court, found that Ryanair had acted unlawfully by not 
ensuring that a wheelchair was provided free for Mr Ross.
The judge awarded the regular traveller Pounds 1,336 in compensation - made up of Pounds 36 to cover the 
original cost of hiring wheelchairs when he flew to Perpignan in March 2002, Pounds 300 for the purchase of a 
wheelchair, and Pounds 1,000 for injury to feelings.
Ryanair pointed out that that it did offer free assistance to disabled passengers if they arrived at the airport with 
their own wheelchairs. However, those seeking a wheelchair once at the airport were directed to a third party 
service provider.
Disabled passenger wins case against Ryanair
Mr Ross claimed this meant that, on a return trip, he had to pay Pounds 36 more than other passengers. Ryanair 
said that Mr Ross was "enjoying" a fare of only Pounds 10 for his flight from London to Perpignan, yet he "still 
expects Ryanair to pay Pounds 18 - or almost twice his airfare - for wheelchair assistance".
The court was told that Ryanair's policy was highly unusual, with most other airlines absorbing the ground 
operators' charges themselves.
The Disability Rights Commission said it was now considering bringing a class action against the airline if Ryanair 
did not offer compensation to the three dozen other disabled passengers who had also complained.

The near 30 per cent decline in Ryanair's share price this week shows how rapidly investors can lose faith in a 
stock market darling. More importantly, Ryanair's profit warning raises questions about whether the business model 
for low-cost airlines is flawed. But it is too soon for national flag carriers to breathe a sigh of relief and decide that 
the intense competition in the industry is over.
Ryanair's shares suffered after its first profits warning ended a period of unbroken earnings growth for the Irish no-
frills operator. The airline said a fierce price war in Europe had led to an enormous reduction in yields - or average 
fare levels. The company's aircraft were flying with a third of their seats empty this month, in spite of offering tickets 
for small change.
One of the ways that Ryanair and its UK rival EasyJet have managed to cut prices so dramatically and make life so 
difficult for national carriers is by slashing costs. Ryanair is the operator with the lowest costs in the world.
But Budget airlines' business plans are built on sharp growth rates and a rising wave of new passengers.
Ryanair had previously kept its costs low by negotiating incentives from regional airports and local authorities to fly 
to certain destinations. However, the European Commission is expected to rule next week that these "sweetheart" 
deals are illegal and that Ryanair must pay back incentives received from Charleroi airport near Brussels.
Europe's competition authorities are expected to go one step further and draw up wider guidelines for the payment 
of subsidies and enticements to carriers by regional airports and local authorities. This means that the Ryanair 
ruling will have implications for the entire industry.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said the Commission's move would be a "disaster" for Europe's low-
cost airline sector. EasyJet has distanced itself from Ryanair over the payment of incentives. But the Commission's 
ruling may prompt regulators to look into EasyJet's agreement with Berlin Schonefeld airport where it has recently 
opened new routes.
Runway may be shortening for budget airlines
Intense competition among low-cost carriers and national airlines has led to a good deal for passengers, who can 
regularly pick up a ticket to a European destination for less than a cup of posh coffee.
Both Ryanair and EasyJet aim to overtake established carriers such as British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa 
on short-haul routes in Europe by the second half of the decade. But it is too soon to write off the bigger airlines. 
British Airways has started to adopt some of the strategies of its upstart rivals. Although recent passenger figures 
showing a recovery in high-margin business travel led to a pick-up in its shares, BA has embarked on a savage 
cost-cutting programme.
This week the carrier announced plans to save an annualised Pounds 300m by March 2006, which is expected to 
lead to 3,000 job cuts. This comes on top of the existing restructuring programme, aimed at making cost savings of 
Pounds 1.1bn over three years to March 2005.
BA is one of the most indebted airlines in Europe. But its shares have performed well in recent months, 
outperforming the FTSE All-Share by 29 per cent in January as investors have bought the recovery story. EasyJet 
has also been buoyed by better prospects and outperformed the market by nearly 10 per cent this month. But 
Ryanair has had no such luck, the carrier had underperformed Ireland's leading index by 5 per cent in the month up 
to its profit warning as the shadow of the Commission's investigation hung over it.
Ryanair has said it will still grow, albeit more slowly. But it might wind down its Buzz subsidiary based at Stansted in 
London, which it bought less than a year ago. Low-cost airlines across Europe have a perilous existence. This 
week, Flying Finn, the Finnish cut-price operator that has been in existence for less than a year, was struggling to 
avoid bankruptcy.
Ryanair has been remarkably successful in an intensely competitive business. The no-frills carrier has been 
operating on margins of close to 20 per cent, which analysts have for some time believed to be unsustainable. Mr 
O'Leary confirmed this when he told investors this week that the company's net profit margin (excluding 
exceptionals) fell from 23 per cent to 16 per cent in the third quarter.
In the medium term, he warned fares would rise if costs were pushed up across Europe. But Ryanair is expected to 
come out fighting. The Irish carrier believes some of the larger national airlines had lobbied the Commission about 
its airport deals. It is concerned it will have to face court cases such as the one it lost against Air France over its 
links with Strasbourg. But Mr O'Leary is not one to go quietly. deborah.hargreaves@ft.com

A seemingly innocuous comment by a man sitting 3,500 miles away was enough to send the London market into a 
tailspin this week.
As expected, Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve held US interest rates at 1 per cent on Thursday. But the Fed 
tweaked its previous proviso that rates could be held "for a considerable period", instead stating it could afford to be 
"patient" in changing its stance.
This was enough to shatter the widely held view that US monetary policy would remain equity-friendly for the whole 
of 2004. "It is now expected that US interest rates will rise in the first half of this year, a shift that may call the 
bottom of the dollar and the top of the excellent rise in US share prices," said Jim Wood-Smith, chief analyst at 
broker Gerrard.
Consequently some of the cyclical sectors most dependent on a low interest rate environment, such as technology, 
telecoms, life assurance and general retailers, lost ground.
The FTSE 100 ended the week 1.6 per cent softer at a fresh six-week low of 4,390.7. Yesterday bearish investors 
even focused on the downside of weaker-than-expected US GDP data, which should lessen the need for rate rises, 
sending the blue-chip index 0.5 per cent lower.
The mid-cap FTSE 250 performed far better yesterday, jumping 1 per cent as some tech exponents came back into 
vogue, but still ended the week 0.4 per cent softer at 6,023.9. Volumes were boosted by programme trading for 
much of the week, hitting 3.7bn yesterday.
At least the warm-hearted market had room in its affections for companies taking the axe to their cost base. British 
Airways soared to the top of the blue-chip leaderboard, rising 3.7 per cent yesterday and 7.4 per cent on the week 
to 305p as it unveiled plans to cut its headcount by 3,000, slicing annual costs by Pounds 300m. Credit Suisse First 
Boston reacted by hiking its price target to 342p from 315p.
Footsie slips as Greenspan drops a hint LONDON:
BA also benefited from investors switching from Irish budget airline Ryanair, which slumped as it lost a legal case 
over state subsidies on some of its routes. Easyjet, 5.7 per cent softer on the week at 338 1/2p, was buffeted by the 
same ill winds as archrival Ryanair, on top of a Deutsche Bank downgrade.
Rumours that Scottish & Newcastle was contemplating closing two of its five UK breweries to cut costs helped send 
its shares 3.1 per cent higher to 395 3/4p, despite yesterday's 2 per cent dip, as vague hopes of a takeover by 
Guinness-to-Smirnoff group Diageo melted with the winter snow.
Aero engine maker Rolls-Royce, up 3.5 per cent at 184 1/2p after yesterday's 0.8 per cent gain, was buoyed by the 
Air Tanker consortium, of which it is a member, winning preferred bidder status for a Pounds 13bn RAF contract. 
VT Group, which is in talks to buy into Air Tanker, rose 8.3 per cent to 268 1/2p. BAE Systems, whose own alliance 
with Boeing was beaten to the punch, lost 3.2 per cent at 164 1/2p on the week.
Drinks group Rexam, 5.5 per cent better at 430p after edging up 0.4 per cent yesterday, was a prime beneficiary of 
a degree of sector rotation from cyclicals to defensives, with Morgan Stanley also repeating its "overweight" stance 
in the belief that recent weakness had been overdone.
But life assurers endured a sorry week, not helped by Legal & General reporting disappointing sales of high-margin 
annuities in its fourth-quarter trading update. The ongoing endowment mortgage debacle also weighed as industry 
chiefs were grilled by the Treasury Select Committee, and CSFB cut its price targets for both L&G (to 95p) and 
Friends Provident (to 117p) in the belief they are most exposed to the problem.
Friends did do its best to lighten the mood yesterday, rising 2.4 per cent to 141 1/2p as it unveiled its best-ever 
annual sales figures, but it still ended the week 1.6 per cent softer. And this did little to help L&G, which slipped a 
further 0.5 per cent to close the week 7.9 per cent lower at 99p.
Sector heavyweight Vodafone dragged telecoms lower as weak figures from Japan took the shine off its best 
organic growth figures in three years. Furthermore, rumours that Vodafone might launch a bid for US outfit AT&T 
Wireless re-kindled memories of its late 1990s buying spree, sending the stock 5 per cent lower to 137 1/2p. BT 
Group, off 2 per cent yesterday, lost 3.6 per cent at 175 3/4p as newcomer Tele2 complained to regulator Ofcom 
about its larger rival.
Yesterday there was strong support for Granada, up 5.6 per cent at 140 1/2p, and Carlton Communications, 5.3 per 
cent better at 281 1/2p. The duo finally begin trading as ITV plc on Monday - precipitating more cost-cutting - and 
hedge funds were reportedly busy closing short positions throughout the week. Both Deutsche Bank and Merrill 
Lynch yesterday published "buy" calls.
Kingfisher rose 2.4 per cent to 277 3/4p after the home improvement chain was upgraded by joint house broker 
CSFB to "outperform" from "neutral" on valuation grounds.
In the FTSE 250, technology stocks Spirent, 6.4 per cent better at 78 3/4p, and Filtronic, up 5.5 per cent at 476p, 
both notched up gains after Canadian telecoms equipment maker Nortel Networks reported a second straight 
quarterly profit and forecast that the market would grow faster in 2004.
Automation and controls group Invensys rose 8.6 per cent to 22p on strong volume of 119m shares amid 
contrasting rumours of an imminent rights issue or an impending disposal.
Acambis rose 4.9 per cent to 320p as the biotechnology group tapped into the cost cutting theme, saying it would 
close its research operations in Cambridge and cut around 280 jobs later this year. Acambis also announced it had 
decided not to invest further resources in three vaccine projects.
But Randgold, the gold miner, slumped 8.1 per cent to Pounds 11.90 as it was hit by a slump in output at the Morila 
mine in Mali, its joint venture with AngloGold of South Africa.
Footsie slips as Greenspan drops a hint LONDON:
Among the small caps, Bookham Technology rose 11.9 per cent to 173 1/2p as tracker funds bought into the stock 
ahead of its promotion to the FTSE 250 index on Monday. The networking group will take the place of Carlton 
Communications.
Alizyme rose 6.8 per cent to 213 1/2p as the biotechnology company said it would receive a further Dollars 3m from 
the Japanese company Takeda, which has a licence agreement for Alizyme's obesity treatment. "We believe the 
next 6-12 months to be pivotal to the company's development with further licensing deals expected," said Seymour 
Pierce.
Property support services group Connaught hit an all-time high of 405p, up 3.2 per cent, after it said that trading 
remained strong and there were substantial opportunities for further growth.
Whittard of Chelsea said business was brewing nicely as the tea and coffee retailer unveiled a substantial rise in 
profits. The shares rose 4.8 per cent to 174 1/2p.

Airport competition: Brussels should weigh perverse effects of its Ryanair ruling

The European Commission looks likely to rule against Ryanair, the low-cost Irish airline, in a Belgian state aid case 
that will affect competition throughout the European Union airline sector. It will deliver its final verdict next week, 
giving the Irish and Belgian commissioners, among others, time to try to overturn or modify the draft decision 
prepared by the Commission's transport directorate. But, unless they succeed, the Irish carrier will be ruled to have 
been in receipt of unfair and illegal state aid from the publicly owned Belgian regional airport of Charleroi.
This is problematic. The Commission has framed its inquiry too narrowly, and ignored the fact that its effort to 
prevent a subsidy race between airports will have the perverse effect of restricting legitimate and desirable 
competition between airports. This will probably also entrench the position of national airports and airlines, which 
have moaned to Brussels about competition from Ryanair.
Commission investigators appear to believe EU rules against competition- distorting state aid have been breached 
by Ryanair's getting what they see as a 15-year sweetheart deal from Charleroi. One remedy they are insisting on 
is for Charleroi to cut back the duration of the aid it gives to Ryanair's training, recruiting and marketing costs to 
open new routes from 15 to three years. The shorter period of aid may indeed be appropriate to money that is 
supposed to fund start-up costs.
But the Commission is also poised to declare illegal the 50 per cent reduction in landing and ground handling 
charges it claims Ryanair gets at Charleroi. Such a cut is standard commercial practice in aviation and other 
industries that regularly grant discounts to bulk suppliers. It is also surely justified by the enormous increase in 
passengers that Ryanair has brought to Charleroi.
Any discounts should of course be available to all, and the Commission should clear up any remaining doubt that 
this is the case at Charleroi. But if privately owned airports offer airlines discounts, why should public ones not do 
so too, particularly as a form of regional development aid? The Walloon regional government, which owns Charleroi 
airport, has every incentive to try to attract people to the depressed ex-steel town. At the outset of its inquiry, the 
Commission declared it would not take into account the "possible positive effects on the regional economy". Why 
not? Airport promotion may pay more local dividends than tourist brochures.
Airport competition: Brussels should weigh perverse effects of its Ryanair ruling
The biggest danger of a short-sighted decision on the Charleroi case lies in the fact that it will shape the general 
guidelines on public subsidies and airports that the Commission plans to issue later this spring. This could restrict 
the beneficial use that airlines such as Ryanair are making of under-exploited regional airports. But just such a 
dispersion of traffic is what Europe needs to relieve the congestion in its crowded skies.

With its first profit warning, Ryanair has signalled that it is not immune to the laws of supply and demand. Until late 
last year, passenger demand kept pace with Ryanair's blistering rush to expand capacity as the low-fare market 
opened up around Europe. 
This was despite the impact on airlines of the September 11 terror attacks in the US, the economic downturn, the 
Iraq war and the Sars virus. Ryanair's surprise admission that yields would drop by up to 30 per cent in the 
January-March quarter indicates that capacity growth has finally outstripped demand.
Michael O'Leary, the ever-ebullient chief executive, has blamed increasing competition from the rash of new low-
cost carriers crowding European skies. But the main driver of the yield erosion lies more with discounting to fill 
seats after a 50 per cent-plus annual expansion in capacity over the last two years. This setback does not mean the 
end of Ryanair's successful business model, but it does reveal that Mr O'Leary has over-egged the pudding.
Next year a slowdown in capacity growth to a more modest 20 per cent after May should provide some yield 
support. But the earnings outlook remains murky, particularly given the regulatory uncertainties over Charleroi 
airport. The sharp share price fall will alert bargain hunters but there is now better near-term visibility at EasyJet, 
which trades on a discount of up to 20 per cent on some estimates. The profit warning will also prompt some 
reassessment about whether Ryanair's business model is superior to its rival's.

Shares in Ryanair, the leader of Europe's budget flights revolution, plunged 31 per cent yesterday after its first profit 
warning.
The Irish carrier admitted that it had overreached itself in its dash to become the continent's biggest short-haul 
carrier, and said an expected European Commission ruling on airport subsidies threatened to increase fares and 
damage profit margins.
Its market value fell by Euros 1.5bn to Euros 3.6bn (Pounds 2.5bn) after it warned that intense price wars across 
European markets - notably Germany, Italy and the UK - had triggered "an enormous and sudden reduction in 
yields", or average fare levels, this quarter.
Ryanair's aircraft were flying 30 per cent empty in January despite a succession of cut-price seat sales, it said. 
Initial bookings for the quarter to March indicated average fares would decline by between 25 and 30 per cent year-
on-year, having fallen 10 to 15 per cent during the previous nine months.
Full-year net profits to the end of March would fall by 10 per cent, the first decline in 15 years, reversing Ryanair's 
earlier guidance for a 10 per cent increase.
The airline is suffering the consequences of an ambitious expansion in which it has increased capacity by 60 per 
cent this year on top of a 50 per cent rise a year earlier.
Investors were also unnerved by leaks of the European Commission's ruling on Ryanair's receipt of alleged illegal 
state aid at Belgium's Charleroi airport.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the Commission was planning a "Communist" move to declare illegal the 
present discounts on landing and handling charges at publicly owned airports. It would be a "disaster" for Europe's 
low-cost airline sector.
He said the airline's growth would continue but at lower profit margins. In the third quarter, Ryanair's net profit 
margin (including exceptionals) fell from 23.2 per cent to 16.1 per cent.
Ryanair shares plunge 31% after profit alert
Ryanair's shares fell by Euros 2.07 to close at Euros 4.70, their lowest since shortly after the September 11 terrorist 
attacks.
Mr O'Leary warned that over the medium term air fares "will inevitably go up, I don't know by how much, if costs are 
pushed up across Europe" by the Commission. But he forecast a fall of up to 20 per cent in Ryanair fares in the 
next 12 months.
He said the airline was launching a "detailed review" of its cost base to halt the profits decline and was negotiating 
to delay some deliveries of 125 new Boeing aircraft.
In the third quarter, Ryanair net profits fell by 5.1 per cent to Euros 40.96m, including exceptional costs of Euros 
6m, ending a run of 26 quarters of rising profits.
JP Morgan cut its net profits forecast for the year to March 2005 by 32 per cent, to Euros 222m. Tough fight on
