Irish low cost carrier Ryanair will on Wednesday announce plans to start flying from Frankfurt airport, a source 
familiar with the matter told Reuters, stepping up competition with Lufthansa on its home turf.
The flights will likely start from the summer 2017 flight season, which begins in March, the source said.
German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, citing industry sources, said Ryanair would fly to popular Spanish 
tourist destinations such as Mallorca.
Airport operator Fraport has been in talks with low cost carriers to boost passenger numbers at Europe's fourth 
largest hub, and chief executive Stefan Schulte told Reuters last month that Fraport could offer financial incentives 
for a limited time to encourage new budget routes.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has previously said high fees and long turnaround times at Frankfurt, London 
Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle make it difficult for low cost operators to fly from those hubs.
The news will provide a further headache for Fraport's main customer Lufthansa, which has slowed growth at its 
main brand and has faced strikes while it tries to lower costs and expand its own budget unit Eurowings.
Shares in Fraport rose 2.8% on Tuesday, making them the biggest midcap gainer, while Lufthansa extended 
losses, down 1.6%, among the biggest fallers on the Dax, after the Reuters report.
Fraport in August cut its forecast for passenger numbers at Frankfurt this year, after attacks in Europe deterred 
long-haul travellers.
Ryanair steps up Lufthansa challenge with flights from Frankfurt
Only a few low-cost carriers, including Spain's Vueling and Iceland's Wow Air, offer flights from Frankfurt, 
accounting for just 4% of passengers. That compares with 20 to 30% at other major international hubs.
Ryanair, meanwhile, has been expanding in Germany, taking advantage of retrenchment by Germany's second 
largest carrier Air Berlin to add flights from Hamburg and Berlin, including on the Berlin-Cologne route popular with 
business travellers.
Fraport's Schulte will on Wednesday host a press conference with Ryanair's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs 
and chief operating officer David O'Brien at Frankfurt airport, the companies said in press invitations sent out on 
Tuesday. They declined to comment on the reason for the press conference.
Lufthansa also publishes third-quarter results on Wednesday. Ryanair is due to report half-year results on Nov 7, 
when O'Leary is expected to give an update on the carrier's progress in attracting business customers. (Reuters)

Irish low cost carrier Ryanair will commence its latest shares buyback programme this week, according to chief 
financial officer Neil Soharan
The carrier announced a &euro;550 million ($608 million) buyback programme on 7 November, after receiving 
board approval. The programme will last four months to February 2017.
The carrier expect to split this 50/50 between American Depositary Receipts and ordinary shares, which will ensure 
it continues to comfortably exceed its 50% European Union ownership requirement.
With this latest initiative Ryanair will bring over &euro;1 billion back to shareholders since the beginning of the 
financial year, says Soharan.
At the end of September Ryanair had net cash of &euro;77 million despite having spent over &euro;600 million on 
capital expenditure, &euro;200 million on debt repayments and &euro;468 million on share buybacks during the half 
year.
The carrier completed its seventh share buyback in June at a cost of &euro;886 million, bringing its total returns to 
shareholders since 2008 to over &euro;4.2 billion.
“We will continue to return surplus funds to shareholders subject to market conditions as long as we remain 
profitable, cash generative, and can fund our capital expenditure (capex) and other operational requirements,” says 
the carrier.
Ryanair reported a 7% increase in first half profits to &euro;1.17 billion as AGB and lower fares delivered 12% traffic 
growth to 65 million customers and a 2% jump in load factor to 95%.

Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) has taken delivery of its ninth leased Boeing 737-800 this year.
The aircraft is the final delivery out of nine aircraft under the airline’s fleet modernisation plan for 2016. With this 
final delivery, UIA has lowered the average age of its fleet from 13.5 years to 11.5 years.
The 2009-vintage aircraft (MSN 37542) is owned by SMBC Aviation Capital and was previously on lease to 
Ryanair, according to Airfinance Journal Fleets.
So far in 2016, the airline has taken delivery of nine 737-800NGs and decommissioned two 737-500s as part of its 
fleet modernisation programme. Both retired aircraft are currently in storage and are expected to be returned to the 
lessors.
The airline now operates 39 aircraft, including 21 737s, with an average age of 8.4 years.
UIA took delivery of two used 737-800s from AerCap in May and will take a total of three aircraft from SMBC 
Aviation Capital this year.

Ryanair extended the leases on two Boeing 737-800 units to accommodate strong growth in passenger numbers, 
according to chief financial officer Neil Soharan.
During the first half of 2017, ended 30 September, the low-cost carrier took delivery of 21 new Boeing 737-800s. 
Plans for the second half includes 31 new aircraft.
Between April and September Ryanair transported 65 million customers and the carrier is on course to carry just 
over 119 million customers in its financial year.
Ryanair says this stronger growth requires a raise in its long term traffic forecast by over 10% from 180 million to 
over 200 million customers per annum by March 2024.
“To achieve this, we have already factored a number of aircraft disposal but we also have the option to extend the 
leases on some aircraft,” says Soharan.
Soharan adds that Ryanair has extended the leases on two 737-800 units for another three-year period starting in 
Spring 2017.

Highlight: IAG warns of possible rise in ticket price because of fall in value of sterling
Body
International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways, blamed a "tough operating environment" including 
sterling weakness for a near 4 per cent drop in operating profit in its third quarter.
But the company's shares closed up 5.9 per cent at 438p yesterday, as the results were in line with market 
expectations, and IAG's trimming of its full-year profit target proved less dramatic than anticipated.
Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive, said the weak pound could prompt BA to increase ticket prices.
IAG , whose results were boosted by the acquisition of Ireland's Aer Lingus in August last year, said it expected to 
generate EUR2.5bn of operating profit before exceptional items in 2016, up 7 per cent on the 2015 figure. The 
company said three months ago it expected earnings to rise at a double-digit percentage rate.
IAG's operating profit for July to September fell 3.6 per cent to EUR1.2bn.
Several European airlines, including IAG, easyJet, Lufthansa and Ryanair have issued profit warnings since the 
summer, as they grapple with economic and political uncertainty after the Brexit vote, the impact of terror attacks in 
Europe and air traffic control strikes.
BA owner blames profit dip on weak pound; Airlines
IAG said yesterday that it had seen "no significant change in its short-term trading conditions". It has been 
especially hit by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote because, while IAG reports in euros, BA 
generates most of its revenue in sterling.
Mr Walsh said IAG's results were strong but had been affected by a "tough operating environment" and that air 
traffic control strikes had caused "continued disruption".
"You can see that the weakness of the pound has had a significant effect on our reported results," he said.
This effect involved a combination of currency translation from sterling into euros and "transaction impact": the 
weaker pound and its negative impact on UK consumers' willingness to travel.
In the third quarter, IAG's net profit rose 9.9 per cent to EUR930m as the company benefited from lower taxes 
compared with the same period last year.
Sterling weakness helped to send IAG's passenger revenue per available seat kilometre, a key performance metric, 
down 13.7 per cent to 6.96 cents.
But passenger load factors - the average proportion of full seats on each flight - dipped by only 0.1 percentage 
point, to 85.6 per cent.
IAG increased capacity by 11.3 per cent in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period in 2015.
That figure would have been only 4.1 per cent without Aer Lingus. IAG's other subsidiaries are Spain's Iberia and 
Vueling, a low-cost carrier.
Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Liberum, noted the impact of sterling weakness, adding: "FX is becoming a material 
headwind, mainly on the translation of sterling profits at British Airways, and recent exchange rate moves suggest 
this challenge will continue to grow."

Body
The government has decided, again, to increase London's airport capacity by building a third runway at Heathrow . 
If all goes well - and there is absolutely nothing in the vexed history of this issue to suggest that it will - then the new 
facilities might be operational in 2030.
That history begins in 1968, when the Roskill Commission was appointed to assess London's airport capacity 
needs. The commission's conclusion in 1971 was that a new airport should be built at Cublington in 
Buckinghamshire, about 40 miles north-west of London.
The commission was distinguished, its report was thoughtful, and its conclusion was almost certainly right. There 
are no good sites for an airport in the crowded south-east of England, but neither of the two principal contenders for 
expansion are places where anyone would choose to build an airport now: Heathrow is too close to London and 
Gatwick is inconvenient for many potential passengers. Cublington was the right distance from the centre to 
minimise noise nuisance, and in the right direction for users' convenience.
But by the time the Roskill Commission reported, the Conservatives had replaced Labour in government, and well 
organised opposition from the shires had drained political support from the Cublington option. For several years, 
Britain has a sorry history of big policies backed by bogus justification; OPINION; Disputed plans for airport 
expansion and high-speed rail illustrate the farc....
politicians played with the fantasy that an airport might be built at Foulness in the Thames estuary. But this proposal 
never made economic sense. The Treasury was determined to kill it, and in 1975, when the political complexion of 
the government had changed yet again, the Treasury got its way.
Despite the projections of a slowdown, which had provided rationalisation for the decision to abandon Foulness, air 
traffic continued to grow rapidly. Stansted, built north-east of London during the second world war as a base from 
which to bomb Germany, was greatly expanded for commercial operations.
For civil aviation, however, closeness to London is more important than closeness to the Ruhr. Stansted became a 
white elephant, eventually finding a role as a base for low-cost airlines: Ryanair is much the largest operator there 
today.
The dreary catalogue of procrastination continued. In 2003 a new airport strategy favoured a third runway at 
Heathrow, to open between 2015 and 2020; in 2009 the Labour government finally and belatedly threw its weight 
behind this proposal. But the wheel of political fortune turned and the plan was scrapped after the 2010 election.
Another fantasy - that high-speed rail could substitute for airport capacity - was pursued for a while. But as planes 
continued to circle congested Heathrow, another commission was appointed, 44 years after Roskill, to review the 
options.
This new report favoured a third runway at Heathrow and after one year's further delay, Theresa May's government 
last week announced its support for this option. But this decision will not be the end of the story, only the beginning 
of a new chapter.
Why are British governments so bad at making these decisions? Politics is central to the answer. Yet many of these 
policy failures occur over issues that are not in any obvious sense political. There is no ideological division over 
high-speed rail, or Hinkley Point, or many of the catalogue of horrors compiled in The Blunders of Our Governments 
, by the political scientists Anthony King and Ivor Crewe.
But our adversarial system encourages governments of any complexion to review the policies of any previous 
government of any different complexion, and the dire consequences of these reversals are particularly obvious in 
the case of London airport expansion.
That tendency to knee-jerk opposition is reinforced by a paradox of democracy - the tyranny of the minority. No one, 
except the people employed there, wants an airport, nuclear power station or railway built next to their home; while 
it is to the general benefit that these facilities are provided. But the clamour of the few who fear they may lose a lot 
drowns the quiet voices of the many who stand to gain a little.
It is also increasingly easy for opponents to use judicial as well as political methods to obstruct and delay. In the 
case of airport expansion, the ability of a small group to veto any specific proposal may simply represent an 
intractable obstacle to any rational policy.
And that quest for rational policy has been blighted by bogus quantification. Roskill made a pioneering and widely 
praised attempt to use cost benefit analysis to define the relevant issues. By the time the Airports Commission 
reported in 2015, this modelling exercise had morphed into a monster, a black box with trailing wires whose 
processes no one could understand, and which offered endless numbers but no insight.
Such over-specified and convoluted models are used as rationalisations for decisions that have in reality been 
taken on quite different grounds.
The power of modern computing, far from facilitating good decision making, gets in the way. Consultants are 
dispatched to find supportive numbers. This happened with HS2 , the proposed high-speed link to Birmingham, and 
for years a policy in search of a justification. Competing cost benefit analyses yield the recommendations their 
sponsors want to hear. We have policy based evidence, not evidence based policy.
Britain has a sorry history of big policies backed by bogus justification; OPINION; Disputed plans for airport 
expansion and high-speed rail illustrate the farc....
These spurious impact assessments provide cover for the increasingly superficial basis on which policy is really 
made. Foulness sounded environmentally friendly, even if it was not much use as an airport. Expanding Heathrow 
is a gesture that allows the new government to claim that, despite Brexit, Britain is "open for business". HS2 is a 
transport project for the 21st century, a fast link to the Northern Powerhouse. The good policy is one that makes a 
good headline.
We suffer from what King and Crewe describe as a "deficit of deliberation". And the rise of populism that has had 
"enough of experts" does not suggest matters will get better any time soon.

Highlight: Investor skills at a premium in sectors most exposed to a slowdown in the UK economy
Body
Brexit means Brexit, as UK prime minister Theresa May likes to remind people.
Britain's vote to leave the EU has also meant a rally in the UK stock market driven by the sharp decline in sterling. 
However, what Brexit means for eurozone equities remains more nuanced.
The UK's rupture with the EU lengthens a list of political risks that will go some way to shaping sentiment towards a 
European stock market that has underwhelmed investors this year.
The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 is down about 5 per cent.
The list of potential political hazards include Italy's December referendum on constitutional reform, as well as 
German and French national elections next year.
"The euro area is already priced for political upheaval," says Karen Olney, a strategist at UBS. "On valuation 
grounds, euro area stocks look cheaper than their British peers, even as the UK faces the risks of its impending 
departure from the EU."
Eurozone stocks braced for Brexit-led upheaval Analysis: Equities
That's despite the Euro Stoxx 600 regaining all the ground it lost since the June 23 referendum. It's up about 12 per 
cent from its nadir in the immediate wake of the vote. However, it has not broken significantly over the closing level 
it reached on polling day, before the shock of the Brexit result.
Does this mean it's a good time to favour eurozone stocks?
Both the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250 (which together make up the FTSE 350 shown on the chart above) have 
been led to records by the 18 per cent fall in the pound, which makes UK exports cheaper and flatters the sterling 
earnings of companies booking revenue in foreign currency.
While the euro has fallen back towards its lowest level since February, it has not provided as much support to 
European companies, especially those that earn a significant portion of profits in the UK currency.
Even with some arguing eurozone equities are undervalued, there are parts of the market with more exposure to 
the dangers of a "hard" Brexit , including Irish equities, European utility stocks and the car industry.
"We know which companies are most exposed," says Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equity strategy at 
JPMorgan Asset Management.
"I don't think the volatility caused undue dislocations, but it is premature [in the Brexit process] to take big calls on 
the depth of the danger."
When such calls are made, they are likely to include Irish stocks, where some of the companies exposed to any 
slowdown in the UK economy include Ryanair, the budget carrier, and Kerry Group, the food producer.
There are also European utility stocks with UK operations, including Spain's Iberdrola, RWE and EON of Germany, 
and France's EDF. Drawn from a defensive sector, these companies will have less to fear from a squeeze on 
consumer spending, but face a hit from a weaker pound.
The automotive industry is one of the most exposed, with the British market typically accounting for about a fifth of 
Germany's annual prediction, making it the biggest destination for exports by volume.
According to analysis from UBS, there are companies within the sector that remain inexpensive relative to their 
peers, including Daimler and Volkswagen. Such nuance within the wider picture emphasises that navigating the 
Brexit effect will put a premium on stockpicking skills within the most exposed sectors.
There is also a sense among investors that tense, detailed and long-running political talks are nothing new in the 
eurozone, and as the fundamentals improve, there could be more room for stocks to flourish.
Mr Macklow-Smith of JPMorgan adds: "For the markets, my hope is that economic logic will outweigh political and 
ideological considerations. There are an enormous number of hypotheticals."
And the risk of a hard Brexit is now emerging as one.

EasyJet , the year's second-biggest FTSE 100 faller, rallied yesterday after UBS forecast an end to earnings 
downgrades.
UBS turned positive on easyJet, which climbed 1.4 per cent to 931.5p. A 47 per cent fall in 2016 means the stock is 
"pricing in material future value destruction" far in excess of that assumed for Ryanair, which has risen to a record 
premium relative to easyJet based on 2017 earnings, UBS argued.
Yet easyJet has plenty of flexibility left to cushion earnings by cutting costs, UBS argued. And with expectations 
having already fallen more than 40 per cent from the recent peak, earnings risk is now "at least neutral", it said.
A mixed wider market pulled the FTSE 100 lower by 0.5 per cent, or 34.07 points, at 6,986.40.
A third profit warning in a year sent Cobham falling 13 per cent to 139.7p, with analysts expecting a dividend cut to 
follow once the defence contractor's new chief executive takes charge.
Cobham's warning of "subdued" demand for marine satellite communications systems also weighed on Inmarsat , 
down 1.8 per cent to 682.5p. The satellite operator relies on shipping companies for around half its revenues.
"The challenging conditions Cobham reference in maritime look consistent with what we know already," argued 
Jefferies. "We don't see the language today as particularly incremental."

Capital equipment stocks drifted after Caterpillar reported weaker sales for September, its 46th consecutive 
monthly decline. Ashtead was 1.1 per cent weaker at £13.10 and Aggreko lost 0.6 per cent to 815.5p. DCC , the 
oil distributor and logistics group, rose 1.9 per cent to £67.05 with Berenberg arguing that recent weakness was 
unwarranted.
Unilever edged 0.4 per cent lower at £34.72 and Reckitt Benckiser was 0.1 per cent weaker at £72.25 after 
Kimberly-Clark, the US-based maker of Kleenex tissues and Andrex nappies, cut 2016 earnings guidance.
It blamed "lower expected benefits from selling price increases, primarily due to the improved currency outlook".
STV gained 6.8 per cent to 427p after Crystal Amber, the activist investor, confirmed it had raised its stake to 10 per 
cent and repeated its long-held view that the Scottish ITV broadcaster should be a takeover target.
Crystal Amber has been lobbying for STV's sale since it first disclosed an interest in 2013, when the shares were 
306p, and was reported over the weekend to be willing to buy up to 20 per cent.
French Connection jumped 14.5 per cent to 37.5p on a report of possible bid interest . Stephen Marks , the 
fashion retailer's founder and 42 per cent shareholder, told Reuters : "There's no comment as there's no story."

THIRD quarter earnings from some of the country's biggest banks will be investors' focus this week, with lenders 
set to report stronger-than-expected results.
Lloyds Banking Group will report results on Wednesday, followed by Barclays on Thursday and Royal Bank of 
Scotland on Friday.
Since the vote to quit the European Union in June, shares in RBS and Lloyds have fallen by about a quarter and 
this week's results will be the first to capture fully the post-referendum landscape.
Before investors turn their eye to banks, however, tomorrow brings first-half results for coffee and hotel group 
Whitbread, with consensus earnings per share expected to rise 12 per cent to 237p.
British Airways owner IAG posts third-quarter results on Friday after EasyJet and Ryanair both warned over profits 
recently.
Other numbers to look out for include trading statements from BP this morning and from Royal Dutch Shell on 
Friday, and an update from GLAXOSMITHKLINE on Wednesday.

Lufthansa's shares jumped almost 8 per cent yesterday after the German airline group unexpectedly raised its full-
year profit target, providing some relief for Europe's aviation sector.
Lufthansa late on Wednesday reported adjusted earnings before interest and tax of EUR1.68bn for the nine months 
to September 30, ahead of a consensus analyst forecast of EUR1.53m.
The Cologne-based group had issued a profit warning in July, citing economic and political uncertainty after the 
UK's June vote to leave the EU and several terror attacks in continental Europe.
Other European airline groups have also issued profit warnings blamed on similar factors, including International 
Airlines Group, easyJet and Ryanair.
But Lufthansa said the "difficult-to-forecast short-term bookings of -business travellers in September have 
developed better than expected".
In addition, measures to address excess fleet capacity and costs were starting to pay off. Lufthansa's shares ended 
the day up 7.9 per cent at EUR11.29.
For the full year, Lufthansa said it expected adjusted earnings before interest and tax to be roughly in line with 
2015, compared with a previous estimate of "below" the 2015 result of EUR1.817bn.
Lufthansa buoyed by brighter profits outlook Airlines
Analysts at Citigroup said this was "significantly better" than a consensus forecast of EUR1.461bn. In spite of the 
improved outlook, Lufthansa is braced for a 7-8 per cent fall in revenues at -constant currency in the fourth quarter.
It cautioned that long-term bookings were still burdened by political and -economic uncertainties.
UBS drew attention to the passenger airline unit's adjusted earnings before interest and tax of EUR1.41bn in the 
first nine months of this year, up from EUR1.35bn on the same period last year.
In spite of the share price rise yesterday, Lufthansa's stock is down more than a fifth this year.

BANKS gave support to the FTSE 100 yesterday, buoyed by good performance from their US counterparts. It was a 
volatile trading day as the European Central Bank held policy steady. The FTSE 100 ended up 0.1 per cent, at

The top risers were Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays, up 3.5 and 3.2 per cent respectively. Good results all 
week from US banks have helped UK banks with substantial fixed income, currency and commodity trading 
operations.
Elsewhere, advertising giant WPP fell 3.6 per cent after French rival Publicis Groupe said third-quarter sales grew 
by just 0.2 per cent.
Concern about advertising revenues hit broadcaster ITV as well, with its shares down three per cent after broker 
Liberum cut its target price for the stock.

 German airline operator Lufthansa (LHA.DE) raised its profit estimate for the full year after stronger-than-
anticipated bookings from business travelers in September.
The company now expects adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) "approximately on previous year's 
level," while earlier this year it indicated profit would decline, a statement published by the company late on 
Wednesday showed.
"Compared to the previous guidance, especially the difficult-to-forecast short-term bookings of business travelers in 
September have developed better than expected," the company said. "The capacity and steering measures initiated 
after the decline in long-term bookings were successful." 
Lufthansa said it now expects revenue to fall between 7% and 8% in the fourth quarter, less than the drop of  8% to 
9% seen in July. Adjusted EBIT in the first nine months of the year was 1.68 billion euros ($1.84 billion), compared 
with 1.69 billion euros a year earlier and the Passenger Airline Group business unit posted adjusted EBIT of 
1.41billion euros, up from 1.35 billion euros a year earlier, the company added. 
Revenue totaled 23.9 billion euros in the first nine months, down from 24.3 euros billion a year earlier. 
Lufthansa said unit costs excluding fuel and currency effects are expected to decrease by 2%-to-3% in the fourth 
quarter, in line with its previous estimates, while fuel costs would decrease by about 140 million euros in the fourth 
quarter compared with the same period last year. 
"Political and economic uncertainties continue to significantly burden long-term bookings, especially on long-haul 
routes to Europe," the company said in the statement. "Forecasting short-term bookings therefore remains 
challenging and may lead to significant volatility in earnings."

It isn't the only airline operator to revise its guidance of late. On Tuesday, low-cost airline Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L) 
said that its annual profit growth would be lower than it previously estimated as a fall in the value of Sterling 
following Britain's referendum on continued membership within the European Union (EU) hurts business.

British shares edged lower on Thursday as advertising giant WPP fell after sales growth at its French peer Publicis 
slowed and mid-caps NCC and Keller plummeted following disappointing updates.
Shares in WPP fell nearly 3% after Publicis Groupe , down 6%, said third-quarter sales grew by just 0.2% on an 
organic basis following the loss of large media accounts in the United States in 2015.
Concern about advertising revenues hit British broadcaster ITV as well, with its shares down 3% after broker 
Liberum cut its target price for the stock.
"We reflect the latest comments from media buyers into our forecasts, which suggest a weaker advertising 
momentum into Q4," Liberum said, lowering its net advertising estimate for 2016.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.2% by 0830 GMT after gaining in the previous two sessions. The FTSE 
250 index fell 0.4%.
The mid-cap index's underperformance was caused by sharp sell-offs in shares of some companies. Cyber security 
company NCC plummeted 35% and headed for its biggest-ever daily decline after it faced some contract 
cancellations and difficulties with some renewals.
Mid-cap engineering companies Keller slumped 25% and Senior fell 20% after both issued profit warnings .
However, airline stocks found some solid ground after German airline Lufthansa, up more than 7%, increased its 
profit target for the year and on expectations that the British government will approve a third runway for London's 
Heathrow airport.
British shares fall on some poor company updates
"All the signals point to the government finally approving the move. This could deliver a major boost to the UK's 
airline sector and knock-on positives for European carriers," ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson said.
Shares in British Airways owner ICG, easyJet and Ryanair rose 2.2 to 3.3%.
The FTSE 100 index, dominated by internationally exposed companies, has surged more than 20% since a post-
Brexit sell-off in June following a drop in sterling. However, the index is up less than 9% since then in dollar terms.

LUFTHANSA increased its profit target for the year after business bookings proved better than expected in 
September and its decision to cut back the amount of seats it planned to offer this year paid off.
The German carrier said yesterday it now expects 2016 adjusted earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) to be 
roughly on the level of last year, when it made just over (EURO)1.8bn (£1.6bn), against a previous forecast for a 
drop.
The upgrade comes in contrast to profit warnings this month from low-cost rivals Ryanair and Easyjet, whose 
greater exposure to the UK make them more vulnerable to weakness in the pound, which has tumbled since the 
country's June vote to leave the European Union.
Last-minute bookings for September, especially from business customers, were better than expected, the carrier 
said.

Ryanair has become the latest big European airline to warn that this year's tough trading conditions will hit earnings 
as it cut its profit forecast for 2016-17 by more than 5 per cent, blaming the impact of the weak pound.
The Irish budget airline, which last issued a profit warning in 2013, had stood out in recent months among large 
European carriers for sticking to its earnings guidance.
But Ryanair said yesterday that the 18 per cent decline in sterling against the euro since the UK referendum on EU 
membership in June would cut its expected full-year net profit to a range of between EUR1.3bn and EUR1.35bn. 
Europe's largest low-cost airline by revenue had previously targeted a range of between EUR1.375bn and 
EUR1.425bn.
The company also warned that its strategy of cutting fares to fill its aircraft might reduce net profit for 2016-17 
further if passenger demand weakened or the pound continued to fall.
There have been months of speculation on whether Ryanair's profit forecast was achievable amid a European 
aviation market hit by fears over the impact of terrorism attacks, sluggish economic growth and air traffic control 
strikes.
But Ryanair's profit warning was less drastic than anticipated and its shares rose 5 per cent to EUR12.41 
yesterday.

The company said average fares in the six months to September 30 had declined 10 per cent, against the 
previously guided 9 per cent, and that it expected a far sharper-than-anticipated fall for the six months to March 31. 
Average fares for the period would fall by between 13 and 15 per cent, against the previously guided 10 to 12 per 
cent.
Michael O'Leary , chief executive, told analysts the outlook meant the company was expecting only "slightly lower 
growth" in profit than before.
"We think this small reduction in the full-year guidance is justified and warranted, given the precipitous decline or 
weakness in sterling over the last number of weeks, particularly when some 26 per cent of our revenues are 
accounted for in sterling," he added.
The new profit forecast was "heavily dependent" on there being no further decline in sterling against the euro or 
additional weakness in fares for the second half of the financial year, he said.
Ryanair said the drop in fares should produce average load factors - the proportion of seats full on each flight - 1 
percentage point higher than previously expected at 94 per cent. It expects to carry 119m passengers in 2016-17, 
up 12 per cent on 2015-16.
"We're using lower prices to stimulate stronger demand than we would've seen this time last year in terms of 
volumes and we expect that to continue to be the case," said Mr O'Leary.

Clothing retailer Next was the big winner among UK stocks yesterday thanks to an upbeat note from Deutsche 
Bank.
The shares gained 5.3 per cent, closing at £47.44. Analysts with the investment bank said the high-street brand 
would benefit from an increasing market share despite a challenging sales backdrop for clothing companies which 
have had to contend with "unhelpfully warm weather through late August and September".
As well as increasing its share, innovations in the company's mail-order business and an easier fourth quarter to 
compare the results to "leave us confident Next should see a reacceleration in sales as seasonal peak 
approaches", Deutsche said.
By contrast, luxury brand Burberry lost 7.2 per cent to close at £14.03. The fall came despite the retailer 
announcing a £125m boost in revenues due to the falling pound.
Sales fell in Hong Kong and Macau and the company's house broker Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded 
the stock citing "limited upside from here".
Supermarket chain Tesco enjoyed a 3.5 per cent increase in its shares, which closed at 208p, following reports 
from research group Kantar Worldpanel that the company had seen the first increase in market share for five years. 
Tesco was the only one of the "big four" supermarkets to see sales growth.
Next buoyed by hopes for increasing market share; London
Overall, the FTSE 100 finished up 0.8 per cent to close at 7,000.06.
Despite a profit warning from Irish budget airline Ryanair , its rival easyJet became the second-biggest gainer in 
the index.
While Ryanair warned that tough trading conditions and a falling pound would hit profits, it only cut its forecast by 5 
per cent - not as bad as the market feared. This helped easyJet to a 5 per cent increase on the day, leaving its 
shares at 918p.
Newcastle upon Tyne-based housebuilder Bellway announced a 40 per cent increase in its dividend after reporting 
increasing profits for the 12 months to the end of July. The company said that it had seen little effect from the result 
of the European referendum on demand for its houses .
The increase in the dividend will bring the total paid this year by the company, which is the UK's fourth-largest 
housebuilder, to 108p. The FTSE 250 company rose by 6 per cent to close at £23.86.
However, the biggest gainer in the mid-cap index was Restaurant Group , owner of chains including Chiquito and 
Frankie & Benny's, which jumped 8.8 per cent to close at 385p after news that the chief executive had increased his 
stake in the company.
The FTSE 250 finished up by 1.1 per cent at 17,994.41.

SHARES in budget airline Ryanair rebounded yesterday afternoon despite a warning that its full year profits are 
likely to be hit by the recent declines in sterling following June's Brexit vote.
The pound plunged to record lows in the wake of the EU referendum result, and has struggled to recoup its losses 
since.
Stock in the low-cost carrier first fell after it reduced its full year guidance by five per cent - it now expects profit to 
come in the (EURO)1.3bn (£1.16bn) to (EURO)1.35bn range, as opposed to the (EURO)1.375bn to 
(EURO)1.425bn range it previously predicted.
That caused its shares to fall as low as (EURO)11.45 at the open, before rising throughout the rest of the day.
"The primary cause of this slightly lower growth in full year profitability is the 18 per cent fall of sterling post-Brexit 
which will reduce second-half average fares by between 13 per cent to 15 per cent as opposed to the previously 
guided 10 per cent to 12 per cent," the airline said.
Ryanair also confirmed first half fares were "marginally weaker" than expected, dipping by 10 per cent as opposed 
to nine per cent, as previously guided. However, these lower fares will be partly offset by a better than expected 
cost performance, the group said.

MINING companies and budget airline EasyJet helped outweigh a sharp drop in Burberry's shares yesterday, with 
the FTSE 100 scraping back above the 7,000 mark. The blue-chip index ended up 0.8 per cent at 7,000.06 points, 
rebounding from a fall the previous day.
Among the biggest gainers was EasyJet, up 5.1 per cent. The stock has fallen about 40 per cent since Britain voted 
to leave the European Union and it issued a profit warning earlier this month. Investors said that there was value in 
EasyJet after rival airline Ryanair followed suit on in cutting its profit forecasts yesterday. Ryanair opened slightly 
lower, but ended over four per cent higher after the airline's chief executive said he expected the carrier's sales and 
market share to grow in the coming months.
Fashion label Burberry slumped 7.2 per cent after reporting results, with analysts at Liberum citing struggling 
wholesale figures despite a surge in UK sales thanks to the weaker pound.

British Airways decided recently to scrap free food and drink on short-haul flights. Ryanair flyers never enjoyed such 
costly frippery - which is why the Irish airline will weather the coming downturn in fares better than peers.
Yesterday, Ryanair reduced its full-year profit forecast by 5 per cent, to about EUR1.3bn. The main cause is the 
weak pound; about a quarter of revenue is in the British currency, against about half at easyJet.
This is worse news for rivals than for Ryanair. The airline is "load-factor active"; it cuts fares until planes are full. 
These fell 10 per cent in the first half and will fall up to 15 per cent in the second. But passenger numbers and load 
factors will be higher, largely at the expense of competitors. Costs will fall by more than expected.
That suggests that European aviation will be grim over the winter. Ryanair shares have done less badly than peers 
so far. Expect that trend to continue - and enjoy BA's fayre while you can.

Two sides of a weak pound: Burberry gains, Ryanair suffers
Two sides of a weak pound: Burberry gains, Ryanair suffers

LONDON (AP) - The economic repercussions of the plunge in the British pound were on display Tuesday as the 
currency's drop helped boost sales at luxury goods maker Burberry but triggered a profit warning from budget 
airline Ryanair.
In simple terms, a weaker pound helps British exporters because it makes their goods cheaper abroad and hurts 
importers because foreign goods become more expensive in the U.K.
Burberry, which is based in Basingstoke, England, and reports its earnings in pounds, said first-half revenue rose 5 
percent because of the U.K. currency's decline against the dollar, euro and yuan. Meanwhile, Dublin-based 
Ryanair, which gets 26 percent of its sales from Britain but reports in euros, said profit would grow slower than 
previously forecast.
"There are clear winners and losers from the fallout in the pound," said Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets.
The pound has lost nearly a fifth of its value against the dollar since Britain's vote on June 23 to leave the European 
Union. That has boosted the value of overseas sales when they are converted back into the U.K. currency. For 
foreign companies like Ryanair the reverse is true unless they can raise prices in Britain.
British consumers were squeezed by these competing forces last week when Tesco, the country's biggest 
supermarket chain, pulled the popular breakfast spread Marmite and other products made by consumer goods giant 
Unilever off its website when the Netherlands-based company maker sought to raise prices. The two companies 
settled the dispute on Thursday without disclosing the terms.
Burberry said Tuesday that it benefited from the pound's weakness, reporting that revenue rose to 1.16 billion 
pounds ($1.42 billion) in the six months ended Sept. 30, from 1.1 billion pounds in the same period last year.
The company got and added boost as tourists from countries such as China and the U.S. flocked to London to take 
advantage of their increased buying power. Sales at British shops open for more than a year rose by more 30 
percent in the three months to Sept. 30.
Two sides of a weak pound: Burberry gains, Ryanair suffers
Bag sales were particularly strong, especially those of the equestrian inspired Bridle Bag.
Burberry said the pound's weakness should add at least 125 million pounds to full-year adjusted profit based on 
Oct. 12 exchange rates.
However, on an underlying basis, which excludes the impact of currency exchange rates, revenue fell 4 percent, a 
weak result that saw Burberry shares slide 7 percent.
"Unfortunately, the U.K. makes up a relatively small percentage of Burberry's sales," said George Salmon, an 
equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. "So while the group has managed to deliver improving like-for-like growth 
in its stores this quarter, this was achieved against a pretty unchallenging comparative period. Conditions remain 
difficult."
Meanwhile, Ryanair cited the slump in the pound as the airline cut its forecast for fiscal 2017 earnings by 5 percent. 
Ryanair said it now expects to report net income of 1.3 billion euros to 1.35 billion euros ($1.43 billion), still 7 
percent better than in 2016.
The pound's drop means that average second-half fares will fall by between 13 percent and 15 percent, compared 
with the previous forecast of 10 percent to 12 percent, the airline said.
"The recent sharp decline in (the pound) post Brexit will weaken second half yields by slightly more than we had 
originally expected," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement. "We would caution that this revised 
guidance remains heavily dependent upon no further weakness in second half fares or (the pound) from its current 
levels."

 European stocks were trading higher on Tuesday morning as a jump in the price of oil provided a fillip for mining 
companies while financial services stocks edged up despite hawkish comments made by a member of the US 
central bank's rate-setting committee on Monday. 
Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer was widely reported as saying on Monday that the US' central bank is 
"very close" to its employment and inflation targets, comments which subsequently fueled bets that US 
policymakers may raise rates in December. 
Oil prices were extending gains meanwhile, with Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, up 0.7% at $51.87 
per barrel while West Texas Intermediate, the main US measure, had added 0.7% to $50.28 a barrel at the time of 
writing. 
In equities, commodities stocks were among the biggest gainers on London's FTSE 100 Index, with BHP Billiton 
(BHP) adding 2.2% and Rio Tinto (RIO) rising 2%. William Hill (WMH.L) gained 2.4% after Canadian online 
gambling company Amaya (AYA.TO) ended merger talks with the British bookmaker. 
UK homebuilder Bellway (BLY.L) rose 2.5% in London after its annual profit beat analyst forecasts, according to 
news reports. Low-cost airline Ryanair (RYA.L) rose 1.5% in London even after lowering its full-year profit forecast 
which it blamed on the drop in the value of the pound.
Financial stocks also advanced across the Continent. Societe General (GLE.PA) gained nearly 3% in Paris, 
Germany's Aareal Bank (ARL.DE) gained 3.5% and Deutsche Bank (DB) rose 2% in Frankfurt. 
Remy Cointreau (RCOP.PA) rose 2.9% in Paris after its second-quarter revenue result beat analyst estimates on 
higher demand for its alcoholic beverages in China, according to news reports. Food products company Danone

(BN.PA) rose 0.6% even after it reported third-quarter revenue that slightly missed analyst estimates, according to

The Europe-wide STOXX 600 index rose 1.1% and the euro-region blue-chip STOXX 50 index gained 1.2%. 
Frankfurt's DAX added 0.8%, London's miner-heavy FTSE 100 climbed 1% and Paris' CAC 40 rose 1.2% at the

Ryanair Cuts Full-Year Forecast for Profit Growth Following Slide in Sterling

 Low-cost airline Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L) warned on Tuesday that its annual profit growth will be lower than it 
previously estimated as a fall in the value of Sterling following Britain's referendum on continued membership within 
the European Union (EU) hurts business. 
Profit in the year ending March 31 is now expected to grow by 7% rather than the 12% the company previously 
forecast. Net income is projected to be in the range of  of 1.3 billion euros ($1.43 billion) to 1.35 billion euros rather 
than in the previously predicted range of between 1.375 billion euros and 1.425 billion euros. 
"This decline is primarily due to the impact of weaker sterling on our second-half fares," Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's 
chief executive officer, said. "While higher load factors, stronger traffic growth and better cost control will help to 
ameliorate these weaker revenues, it is prudent now to adjust full year guidance." 
In the June referendum UK voters opted to exit the EU, a scenario frequently referred to as 'Brexit', with the result 
taking markets by surprise and resulting in a sharp slump in the UK currency. The pound fell to a 31-year low 
following the referendum and, after a period of recovery, it revisited those lows on speculation that the government 
might be willing abandon the single market in favor of controling immigration. 
The decline in sterling will reduce second-half average fares by between 13%-to-15% as opposed to the previously 
estimated 10%-to-12%, Ryanair said. Fares in the first half were 10% weaker compared with the initially estimated 
9%, the company said. 
The budget airline said it will pursue a strategy of making sure flights are loaded rather than focusing on ticket 
prices. Full-year load factor will be 1% better than previously seen at 94%, it said. Full-year traffic will increase to 
119 million passengers, 12% higher than last year. The impact of lower fares on earnings will also be partly offset 
by lower costs. Ryanair sees full-year ex-fuel unit costs declining by 3% rather than by 1% as previously expected.

       VIENNA (dpa-AFX) - European stocks are rallying on Tuesday, as a weaker dollar supported commodity prices 
and soft U.S. data dented hopes of a Fed rate hike in November.   Well-received earnings updates from the likes of 
Hays Plc, Bellway and R\xE9my Cointreau also buoyed investor sentiment ahead of Chinese GDP data due on 
Wednesday and the ECB meeting on Thursday.  The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index is currently up 1.20 
percent at 341.46 in midday trading after closing 0.7 percent lower in the previous session. 
The German DAX is rallying 1.3 percent, France's CAC 40 index is moving up 1.2 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 
is adding 0.9 percent.   R\xE9my Cointreau shares are up more than three percent in Paris. The wine & spirits 
company reported a 2.5 percent rise in first-half sales on the back of improved cognac sales in China and robust 
demand for its premium cognac in the United States.  Mining stocks such as Anglo American, BHP Billiton, 
Glencore and Rio Tinto are up 2-3 percent, while energy majors Tullow Oil, Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc are 
climbing 1-3 percent.   Shares of Hays Plc are moving up 2 percent. The recruitment company reported growth in 
net fee income for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, led by strong performance in its international businesses.  
Bookmaker William Hill is adding 1.5 percent after it ended talks of a possible merger with Canadian online poker 
giant Amaya.  Homebuilder Bellway is up over 1 percent on reporting a jump in full-year profit and raising its 
dividend.  Continental shares are tumbling 2 percent after the German tire maker cut its earnings outlook for fiscal 
2016, citing antitrust and warranty provisions.  Swiss logistics firm Kuehne + Nagel Group is losing 3 percent after 
its earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 missed estimates.   Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings is 
rallying 2.5 percent in London despite lowering its profit outlook.   On a relatively light day on the economic front, a 
government report showed that U.K. consumer inflation hit a two-year high in September on higher clothing and 
transport costs, as a result of the weakening pound since the EU referendum vote.   Inflation rose to 1 percent from 
0.6 percent in August versus expectations for a 0.9 percent increase. Factory gate prices also rose at a faster pace 
of 1.2 percent annually in September, following a rise of 0.9 percent in August.  Globally, most Asian shares rose 
today and U.S. stock futures indicate a positive open, as the dollar weakened against rivals on uncertainty over 
when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.

       LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, on Tuesday warned that it expects its annual 
net profit to fall by up to 125 million euros (138 million dollars), mainly due to a plunge in the pound since Britain's 
Brexit vote.  The airline said it expects net profit of 1.3 billion to 1.35 billion euros, down 5 per cent from a previous 
forecast of 1.375 billion to 1.425 billion euros, after the pound lost about 18 per cent of its value against the dollar 
since the Brexit referendum on June 23.  The fall in the British currency will reduce Ryanair's average fares by up to 
15 per cent in the second half of this year, it said. 
 'While higher load factors, stronger traffic growth and better cost control will help to ameliorate these weaker 
revenues, it is prudent now to adjust full-year guidance, which will rise by approx 7 per cent rather than our original 
guidance of 12 per cent,' Ryanair owner Michael O'Leary said in a statement.  'This decline is primarily due to the 
impact of weaker sterling on our H2 fares,' O'Leary said, adding that the new forecast 'remains heavily dependent 
upon no further weakness in sterling from its current levels.'  Budget airline easyJet issued a similar warning earlier 
this month, saying its annual profit is likely to suffer a 90-million-pound hit from the plunging pound and further 
impact from a fall in passenger numbers caused by security fears.   Copyright dpa

Ryanair trimmed its full-year profit forecast by 5% on Tuesday because of the fall in the value of sterling and said 
that average fares could drop by up to 15% this winter.
Ryanair earns about a third of its revenues in sterling while about 20% of its costs are in the currency, a company 
spokesman said.
The low-cost airline, Europe's largest, said it expects net profit for the year to March 31 of between 1.3 billion euros 
and 1.35 billion euros, down from a previous forecast of 1.375 billion euros to 1.425 billion euros.
The mean forecast of 16 analysts polled by Reuters ahead of the profit warning was 1.383 billion euros.
"The primary cause of this slightly lower growth in full-year profitability is the 18% fall of sterling post-Brexit, which 
will reduce second-half average fares by between 13% and 15%," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a 
statement.
"We would caution that this revised guidance remains heavily dependent upon no further weakness in second-half 
fares or sterling from its current levels," O'Leary added.
Rival easyJet, half of the passengers of which originate in the UK, has already cut its profit forecast for the year to 
Sept. 30 in the wake of Britain's vote to leave the European Union and the subsequent fall in sterling. (Reuters)

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) Tuesday said it has reduced its 
full year net profit guidance by 5% to a range of 1.30 billion euros to 1.35 billion euros from a previous range of 
1.375 billion euros to 1.425 billion euros.  The company attributed the revision in outlook primary to the 18% fall of 
Sterling post Brexit which will reduce second-half average fares by between 13% to 15% as opposed to the 
previously guided 10% to 12%.  For the full year, profits are now expected to grow by 7 percent, compared to 
previously expected growth of 12 percent.  Further, Ryanair confirmed that its first half fares were marginally 
weaker at minus 10%, compared to previously guided minus 9%. However, these lower fares will be partly offset by 
a better than expected cost performance. 
 Ryanair now expects full year ex-fuel unit costs to decline by 3% compared to previously guided 1%. Ryanair also 
expects full year load factor to be 1% better than guided at 94%, and now expects that full year traffic will increase 
to 119m, which is 12% growth on last year's 106m customers.  Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said, 'The recent 
sharp decline in Sterling post Brexit (which accounts for approx. 26% of Ryanair's FY17 revenues) will weaken H2 
yields by slightly more than we had originally expected. While higher load factors, stronger traffic growth and better 
cost control will help to ameliorate these weaker revenues, it is prudent now to adjust full year guidance....'  O'Leary 
added that the company would caution that this revised guidance remains heavily dependent upon no further 
weakness in H2 fares or Sterling from its current levels.  In London, Ryanair shares were trading at 11.71 euros, 
down 0.85 percent.

European Shares Rally As Weak Dollar Lifts Commodity Prices
On a relatively light day on the economic front, a government report showed that U.K. consumer inflation hit a two-
year high in September on higher clothing and transport costs, as a result of the weakening pound since the EU 
referendum vote.
Inflation rose to 1 percent from 0.6 percent in August versus expectations for a 0.9 percent increase. Factory gate 
prices also rose at a faster pace of 1.2 percent annually in September, following a rise of 0.9 percent in August.
Globally, most Asian shares rose today and U.S. stock futures indicate a positive open, as the dollar weakened 
against rivals on uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.

Ryanair Cuts FY Profit View Amid Weak Sterling Post Brexit - Quick Facts
Ryanair Cuts FY Profit View Amid Weak Sterling Post Brexit - Quick Facts
RTT News (United States)

Body
(RTTNews) - Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) Tuesday said it has reduced its full year net 
profit guidance by 5% to a range of 1.30 billion euros to 1.35 billion euros from a previous range of 1.375 billion 
euros to 1.425 billion euros.
The company attributed the revision in outlook primary to the 18% fall of Sterling post Brexit which will reduce 
second-half average fares by between 13% to 15% as opposed to the previously guided 10% to 12%.
For the full year, profits are now expected to grow by 7 percent, compared to previously expected growth of 12 
percent.
Further, Ryanair confirmed that its first half fares were marginally weaker at minus 10%, compared to previously 
guided minus 9%. However, these lower fares will be partly offset by a better than expected cost performance.
Ryanair now expects full year ex-fuel unit costs to decline by 3% compared to previously guided 1%. Ryanair also 
expects full year load factor to be 1% better than guided at 94%, and now expects that full year traffic will increase 
to 119m, which is 12% growth on last year's 106m customers.
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said, "The recent sharp decline in Sterling post Brexit (which accounts for approx. 
26% of Ryanair's FY17 revenues) will weaken H2 yields by slightly more than we had originally expected. While 
higher load factors, stronger traffic growth and better cost control will help to ameliorate these weaker revenues, it is 
prudent now to adjust full year guidance...."
O'Leary added that the company would caution that this revised guidance remains heavily dependent upon no 
further weakness in H2 fares or Sterling from its current levels.
In London, Ryanair shares were trading at 11.71 euros, down 0.85 percent.

DUBLIN (AP) - Budget airline Ryanair has cut its 2017 profit forecast citing the slump in the British pound.
The Irish-based carrier reports earnings in euros but does hefty business in the United Kingdom. Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary says the 18 percent drop in the pound's value since Britain voted in June to leave the European 
Union has hurt the euro value of 26 percent of the airline's sales.
As a result, he said Tuesday, Ryanair's forecast for net profits in fiscal 2017 was being cut by 5 percent to a new 
range of 1.3 billion euros to 1.35 billion euros ($1.43 billion to $1.49 billion), still 7 percent better than in 2016.
Fuel costs are projected to fall 3 percent. The airline expects passenger volume to rise 12 percent to 119 million.

brands group Burberry tumble.
Body
A higher-than-expected inflation reading blunted a rally in the pound but saw the FTSE 100 extend its gains on the 
day.
Having jumped 0.6% against the dollar earlier, sterling traded just 0.0070 higher at $1.2250  and down 0.0036 
against the euro after the Office for National Statistics said the annual rate of inflation jumped to 1% last month, up 
from 0.6% in August. 
This was ahead of analyst forecasts of a 0.9% rise and is the highest level   in the consumer price index (CPI) since 
later 2014.
Tom Stevenson of Fidelity International, the fund manager, said: ‘The significant leap in the CPI from August has 
primarily been as a result of the plummeting pound which has pushed up fuel prices.
‘Even though 1% is still some way off the Bank of England’s 2% inflation target, the impact of currency changes 
works with a lag so further rises in CPI should be expected. Indeed, inflation is expected to continue its upward 
charge, with some economists predicting that CPI could reach as much as 3% by next year, considerably 
overshooting the Bank of England’s target.’
UK government bonds steadied after yesterday’s sell-off with the yield on benchmark 10-year gilts slipping 0.003 to 
1.123% as their price rose. Yields on shorter-term gilts rose however, as their prices fell, with two-year gilt yields 
adding 0.018% to 0.222%.
The FTSE 100 advanced 75 points or just over 1% to 7,022, led by Easyjet (EZJ) which rose 3.8% to 906.5p after a 
warning from rival Ryanair (RYA.I) that the sharp fall in the pound would reduce full-year profits. Its shares gained 
2.5% in Dublin.
The impact of a weak pound was evident in results from Burberry (BRBY). Shares in the luxury goods company 
dived 8.5% or £1.28 to £13.84 after warning of continued subdued demand in Hong Kong. However, the decline in 
the pound means in sterling terms sales had risen.

It used to take the Symingtons of the famous port family 12 minutes to commute by speedboat between their two 
wine farms, Quinta do Bomfim and Quinta dos Malvedos, on the river Douro. Today it's much longer. They have to 
proceed with caution because of the wash from so many large pleasure boats. Ricardo Sousa Campos is the 
commercial director of Quinta da Romaneira and, like most of those in the northern Portuguese wine business, is 
based in the principal city, Oporto. However, he is trying to get out. "You can't move for tourists nowadays," he 
says. "Everyone's signing up for Airbnb ."
Oporto - or Porto as it is known in Portuguese - is buzzing, perhaps benefiting from the downturn in tourism to the 
likes of Turkey and north Africa. Ryanair flies in visitors from 12 countries, EasyJet from five.
Last month, for the first time in a few years, I visited the spruced-up city and the beautiful Douro valley upstream. I 
was amazed by the growth in tourism - not least because when I first visited the city in 1976 it was truly grimy and 
seemed to be full of dirty washing, cobbles and barefoot children. According to the official figures, the number of 
hotel-bed nights has risen by 57 per cent since 2012, with revenues from hotels alone up 70 per cent in the same 
period, not counting Airbnb and the like. Oporto expects to notch up 10m bed nights in 2018. On every corner there 
seem to be stylish bars and restaurants that would not look out of place in Barcelona or Milan, and even the staid 
old port lodges in Vila Nova de Gaia, across the river from the old city, have transformed themselves into wine-
themed "experiences", with multilingual guides, souvenir shops and eating places.
Oporto's happier valley Wine
Adrian Bridge, managing director of The Fladgate Partnership that - with Taylor, Fonseca and Croft - is a major 
player in the port business, is now almost better known as a hotelier. He converted a bit of land next to the Taylor's 
lodge in Vila Nova de Gaia into The Yeatman, a luxurious hotel with a Michelin-starred restaurant, and is now 
drawing up plans to transform the Infante de Sagres, Oporto's most famous hotel. Last winter he performed a 
similar trick on the Douro valley's biggest hotel, the Vintage House in Pinhão, which overlooks all those excursion 
boats.
There are generous EU subsidies and loans for both building and renovating hotels, which have encouraged other 
wine producers to go into the hotel business, not just in Oporto and Gaia but in what was until recently the sparsely 
populated Douro valley , adding considerably to employment prospects there. Quinta de la Rosa, just outside 
Pinhão, for example, operates a popular small hotel as well as an admired wine farm.
The team behind another highly regarded producer of Douro table wines, Quinta do Vallado, has built 13 rooms at 
the quinta downstream of Pinhão and, more ambitiously, has created an eco-friendly eight-room hotel, Casa do Rio 
(river house), way upriver in the deserted Douro Superior region on the Spanish border. João Ferreira Álvares 
Ribeiro of Quinta do Vallado told me that from May this year they have enjoyed 100 per cent occupancy, and that 
their activities providing bed and board now represent 20 per cent of total turnover. "We stick to table d'hôte, so the 
margins are good - much better than in the wine business," he said. He is worried that tourism in his region is 
growing dangerously fast but admits that it certainly helps the reputation of his wines: "This year we'll sell 
EUR200,000 worth of wine in our shop - at double margin. That's more than our sales to most export markets."
The growth of tourism must be some consolation for wine exporters, who are grappling with the fallout from the 
economic collapse of their biggest export markets, Angola and Brazil.
The evolution of the Douro valley from deserted Unesco World Heritage site to tourist playground has been helped 
enormously by road building. Part of the magic of the Douro's extreme climate - blisteringly hot summers and 
testing winters - is because of the mountains as high as Ben Nevis that shield it from the Atlantic. When Adrian 
Bridge first came to Portugal in 1982 it took five-and-a-half hours to drive to Taylor's famous Quinta de Vargellas in 
the Douro valley; it now takes no more than two, thanks in particular to a 5.4km tunnel that opened last May. It is so 
new that when wine producer Dirk Niepoort drove me to the airport from the Douro last month, he initially forgot the 
new time-saving route.
It was only in the late 1970s that electricity arrived in the Douro, facilitated by the dams that have transformed a 
fast-moving river with rapids, over which flat-bottomed boats loaded with barrels of port used to be navigated every 
spring, into a series of lakes connected with locks for the pleasure boats. Port used to be foot-trodden in semi-
darkness but rising labour costs and electricity have resulted in a range of automated alternatives, involving various 
forms of stainless steel and silicone pads to emulate the human sole.
In the old days, when local workers were expected to spend eight hours picking grapes in the steep vineyards, 
followed by four treading them, are long gone, although a small proportion of top-quality port is still trodden by 80 
sticky purple feet. (This has, in its time, caused upset in some of the more fastidious markets - such as Japan.)
Looking ahead to even greater challenges finding labour, one of the most powerful port technicians, Charles 
Symington, of the family responsible for Dow, Graham, Warre and now Cockburn ports, has just begun trying out a 
mechanical harvester in the Douro. The terrain is so steep and varied that it is not an obvious candidate for 
mechanisation, but he is using a machine designed for the precipitous vineyards of the Mosel valley in Germany. 
The only modification needed, apparently, was a reverse gear - something it is far too late for the five Symington 
cousins, who invest all their dividends in new vineyards, to apply.

Michael O'Leary offers to build P200m terminal at Dublin Airport

The Irish Times has today reported that Ryanair Chief Executive, Michael O’Leary, told a gathering that included 
Government ministers that his airline would provide a third terminal at Dublin Airport for €200 million.   There is 
speculation that Dublin Airport will need a third terminal if growth continues at the pace that saw it handle a record 
25 million passengers last year.
Mr O’Leary agrees that Dublin will need a third terminal but warns that the airport’s manager, State-owned DAA, 
should not have any involvement in it.   Mr O’Leary said recently Ryanair could provide the third facility and would 
do it for €200 million. The airline chief executive and DAA clashed regularly over the design and cost of the airport’s 
second terminal, which was completed in 2010. During that controversy, Ryanair several times said that it could 
build and operate a second terminal at Dublin itself.   According to the report, Mr O’Leary offered to build the third 
terminal when he was speaking to a Fine Gael business breakfast attended by several cabinet members, including 
Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, and his colleagues Leo Varadkar, Simon Coveney and Richard Bruton last 
week.    He repeated Ryanair’s position that airlines should not pay any more for Dublin’s proposed second runway 
than the collective €250 million agreed with the Commission for Aviation Regulation two years ago.
This would add about 59 cent to the airport’s current passenger charge, which is capped at €9.87 a head. DAA has 
estimated that the cost of the new runway is likely to be €320 million, which could increase passenger charges.

 European stocks were marginally higher on Tuesday morning as gains by designer goods retailers offset declines 
by airlines that were dragged down by a jump in oil prices during the previous session. 
Brent oil, the international benchmark, was flat at $53.18 per barrel, at the time of writing after rising 3.4% in 
Monday, while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, was 0.1% higher at $51.42 a barrel, after adding 4.2% 
the day before. Oil trading sentiment has been influenced of late by Russia's announcement that it would join 
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in curbing oil output.
OPEC is responsible for generating around 40% of oil globally and an agreement to lower oil production arrived at 
in principle towards the end of September is expected to be finalised at OPEC's meeting in Vienna before the end 
of the year.
In equities, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (MC.PA) rose nearly 5% after reporting third-quarter sales that 
beat expectations. Other clothing and accessories retailers, such as Christian Dior, (CDI.PA), rose 4.5% in Paris 
and Burberry (BRBY.L) gained 2.8% in London. Hugo Boss (BOSS.DE) climbed 2.6% in Frankfurt.  
Aviation stocks were among the decliners in the morning session. Air France (AF.PA) dropped 1.1% and aircraft 
maker Airbus (AIR.PA) declined 2.5% in Paris. EasyJet (EZJ.L)  fell 0.8% in London, while Ryanair (RY4C.IR) 
dropped 1.1% in Dublin. 
And Victrex, (VCT.L) a supplier of polymers for industrial uses, soared more than 10% in London after posting 
annual sales that beat forecasts. Utility company E.ON (EOAN) rose 2% and Uniper (UN01.F) formed after the 
separation of E.ON fossil fuel assets into a separate company, gained 0.9% in Frankfurt. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index slid 0.03%, London's FTSE 100 Index was 0.13% higher, Frankfurt's DAX 
was up by 0.11% and Paris' CAC-40 was 0.17% higher at the time of writing.

Highlight: Ryanair boss brands RTÉ ‘North Korean rat-infested union shop’
Body
Michael O’Leary has said thousands of gardaí should be sacked if they do not show up for work next month, and 
compared RTÉ to North Korea.  
The Ryanair chief executive said the threat of industrial action by rank-and-file gardaí was “immoral”.  
O’Leary was addressing a private Fine Gael breakfast fundraiser in the Shelbourne Hotel last Wednesday.  
The event was attended by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan, who described O’Leary as Ireland’s “leading 
altogether decent man”. Several Fine Gael ministers, TDs and senators, as well as representatives from a number 
of top accountancy firms attended. 
O’Leary said RTÉ was a “North Korean rat-infested union shop” as he criticised the way in which it reported the 
recent bus strikes. 
The Garda Representative Association (GRA), which acts on behalf of 10,500 rank-and-file gardaí, has said 
members will unilaterally withdraw services next month after they rejected a revised pay deal from the Department 
of Justice. Talks are ongoing between the department and the GRA in a bid to resolve the dispute and avoid a 
mass walk-out of gardaí on November 4, 11, 18 and 25.  
O’Leary said that if 6,000 guards staged a walk-out, he would sack them all. He made the comparison to former US 
president Ronald Reagan’s decision to sack air traffic controllers when they went on strike in the 1980s.  
“He thinks we should go full Reagan on them,” said one backbencher who attended the event.  
While O’Leary said gardaí did a “fantastic job”, he did not believe they should be allowed to go on strike. He said 
gardaí earned higher than the average industrial wage and were allowed to retire after 30 years of service. In a 
O’Leary: I would sack all Garda strikers
wide-ranging speech and Q&A, O’Leary criticised striking bus workers and said he despised the way Dublin City 
Council pandered to cyclists “who pay nothing”.  
He said the state was “shit” at providing transport services and “really crap” at running the health service, saying 
they should both be privatised.  
O’Leary is said to have dismissed the notion that private sector workers are treated worse than public sector 
workers. He claimed that Ryanair workers were not unionised because they had good working conditions and were 
well paid.

       WASHINGTON (dpa-AFX) - After moving modestly lower earlier in the session, stocks have seen some further 
downside in recent trading on Friday. The major averages have slid firmly into negative territory, hitting new lows for 
the session.   In recent trading, the major averages have climbed off their worst levels of the day. The Dow is down

500 is down 13.51 points or 0.6 percent at 2,147.26.  The weakness on Wall Street comes following the release of a 
report from the Labor Department showing that U.S. employment increased by less than expected in the month of 
September. 
 The report said non-farm payroll employment climbed by 156,000 jobs in September compared to economist 
estimates for an increase of about 176,000 jobs.  While the job gains in August were upwardly revised to 167,000 
from 151,000, the job growth in July was downwardly revised to 252,000 from 275,000.  The Labor Department also 
said the unemployment rate edged up to 5.0 percent in September from 4.9 percent in August. Economists had 
expected the unemployment rate to remain unchanged.  Meanwhile, the report said average hourly employee 
earnings rose by 6 cents to $25.79. Compared to the same month a year ago, average hourly earnings were up by 
2.6 percent.  Speaking at the Institute of International Finance's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Federal 
Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said the jobs data was 'pretty close' to an ideal 'Goldilocks' reading.  Fischer 
said the rate of job growth is 'fully consistent' with a continued decline in unemployment and suggested the U.S. is 
close to full employment.  Analysts said the weaker than expected job growth should quell any speculation of an 
interest rate hike at Fed's next meeting in November, although a rate hike at the December meeting remains on the

Full-year pre-tax profits at easyJet were set to fall by a sharper than expected 28 per cent, Europe's second-biggest 
low-cost carrier warned yesterday.
The company's trading update , ahead of full results in November, follows a profit warning in June prompted by 
economic uncertainty, excess airline capacity and air traffic disruption.
But Carolyn McCall , chief executive, said tough conditions represented an opportunity for easyJet to "build and 
strengthen" its market position.
The company said it expected full-year pre-tax profits in a range between £490m and £495m, compared with 
£686m for the year to September 30, 2015 .
While easyJet has not previously forecast its profit for the year, analysts had expected a figure of between £497m 
and £517m.
EasyJet shares were down 6.9 per cent to a three-year low in London yesterday.
A series of European airlines have issued profit warnings as they absorb the impact of terrorist incidents, air traffic 
control disruption and economic uncertainty at a time when fleets are growing rapidly.
Clouds ahead: EasyJet profits in rapid descent
EasyJet's exposure to some of the markets suffering most severely from terrorism and its heavy dependence on the 
UK, where demand has suffered after the Brexit vote, has hit it hard.
The company faces a challenge from Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers, which has 
consistently lower costs than its rival.
It said yesterday that its cost per seat, excluding fuel, was likely to fall a better than expected 1.1 per cent for the 
year ending September 30, after stripping out the effects of currency movements.
However, the company expected the negative effect of currency movements to reduce pre-tax profits by £90m 
compared with the previous year, a £35m increase from its forecast in June. It expected a similar impact for 2016-
17.
The company faces one-off costs for setting up an operation in mainland Europe to ensure it can continue to 
operate flights between EU countries once its base in Luton, near London, is outside the bloc.
The airline carried 73.1m passengers during the financial year, up 6.6 per cent on the previous year.
Ms McCall said: "We have been disproportionately affected by extraordinary events this year but our excellent 
network, cost control and revenue initiatives and our strong balance sheet underpin our confidence in the 
business."  Robert Wright

Airlines are fond of blaming delays and cancellations on external and "one-off" factors. They take the same 
approach to profit warnings; easyJet chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall said yesterday that full-year profits 
would be some £25m below consensus forecasts because of service disruption from strikes and terrorism, and 
currency movements.
Her excuses are justified. EasyJet is the biggest short-haul carrier in the UK (half of revenues) and the second-
biggest in France, so it is more exposed than peers to the effects of Brexit and terror attacks in Paris and Nice. 
Unlike Ryanair and Wizz, it reports in sterling, so it is no surprise that a weak pound has added £90m to full-year 
costs.
Dame Carolyn has also railed against the "irrational" expansion of other airlines . Here, she is on shakier ground. 
easyJet's own capacity grew 6.1 per cent in its final fiscal quarter and is set to grow by more next year. So far, it 
has filled those extra seats, but only by cutting prices. Revenue per seat was almost 9 per cent lower in the quarter.
True, easyJet has judiciously controlled the costs it can. But non-fuel expenses are set to rise slightly next year, 
even before any additional burden arising from negotiations with the pilots' union .
And while fuel costs will drop sharply - four-fifths of this year's requirements are hedged at almost $200 per tonne 
less than the previous year's - they will do so at other carriers, too. Ryanair has already pledged to pass on its 
sharply lower fuel costs in the form of lower fares.
The blame Dame
The 6 per cent fall yesterday means easyJet shares have almost halved over the past year, worse than low-cost 
peers. Pre-tax profit forecasts have come down by a third in the past six months. There is a silver lining: lower tax 
rates applied to deferred liabilities mean net income will fall by less than pre-tax profit.
That implies a dividend (based on a payout ratio of half of post tax income) of 53p a share for a yield of 5.6 per 
cent, higher than more challenged rivals such as Lufthansa and IAG. But like many of its setbacks, the tax windfall 
too is an external, one-off affair.

Smith & Nephew was among yesterday's biggest fallers after Berenberg cut the medical devices maker from its 
"buy" list.
Management's record of anticipating problems was "not great", while its conservative approach to the balance 
sheet was limiting growth prospects, the broker said.
The shares - which were trading ex a 12.3p dividend - slid 3.4 per cent to £12.22.
While S&N had been doing the right thing by cutting costs and investing in growth, the benefits over the past five 
years had been "largely offset by various mis-steps and one-off headwinds", said Berenberg.
Earnings growth has been blunted by issues including China market destocking, a slump in demand for metal-on-
metal hip replacements, the 2014 product recall of its Renasys wound therapy, and the failure of experimental 
spray-on skin.
Given S&N's diverse nature, both by geography and product, further setbacks were likely, the broker added.
On the possibility of S&N being a takeover target, Berenberg saw Johnson & Johnson as a more viable bidder than 
Stryker or private equity funds, which it said would struggle to find an exit.
S&N falters after broker predicts more setbacks ahead; London
S&N had been viewed as a takeout candidate since 1968, when Unilever launched a failed bid, and "investors 
cannot wait for ever", said Berenberg.
A sharp jump in gilt yields weighed across the wider market, pushing the FTSE 100 lower by 0.5 per cent, or 33.29 
points, to 6,999.96.
Airlines faded on a cautious update from easyJet , which dropped 6.9 per cent to a three-year low of 933.5p. British 
Airways owner IAG lost 3.9 per cent to 381.3p and Ryanair slid 1.2 per cent to sEUR11.74.
Marks and Spencer led the retailers lower, losing 2.1 per cent to 330.6p. Numis Securities downgraded M&S to 
"reduce" as part of research advising wariness of mature retailers, which it expected to underperform as Brexit 
weighed on employment growth.
Numis also turned cautious on Halfords , down 1.1 per cent to 347.1p, and Next , which slipped 1.2 per cent to 
£47.47.
Dunelm , a soft furnishings retailer, lost 4 per cent to 823p after reporting a difficult start to its financial year.
Leading the FTSE gainers, Croda took on 1.5 per cent to £36.11. UBS upgraded from "sell" to buy", largely on a 
positive view of the chemicals group's investment in a US bioethanol refinery.
With costs due to normalise in 2018, Croda would have the balance sheet capacity to nearly double its dividend and 
spend £100m a year on bolt-on acquisitions, UBS forecast.
Engineer GKN advanced 0.5 per cent to 333p. HSBC started coverage with a "buy" rating and 395p target price.

LOW COST airline Norwegian carried nearly 2.8m passengers in September - an increase of 14 per cent on the 
same month last year.
Close to three million passengers flew with the airline last month, while total traffic growth increased by 21 per cent 
and capacity growth was up 19 per cent.
Norwegian CEO Bjorn Kjos said: "September's figures show that our positive development continues across all 
markets, both with more passengers and a high load factor.
"It is also satisfying to see that more customers are choosing Norwegian when they are flying between the US and 
Europe and Europe and Asia."
The airline's fleet renewal programme has been continuing throughout this year with the delivery of 21 new aircraft.
Kjos has previously praised the virtues of budget airlines. He noted in the mid-2000s that when fuel prices soared 
and competition from Ryanair and Easyjet became fierce, his airline would have to buy fuel-efficient planes and 
expand to new locations. It launched UK flights in 2003.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) American depositary shares were trading more than 1% lower on Thursday in 
sympathy with easyJet as the London-listed low-cost carrier issued a profit warning and as UK airlines face 
challenges due to the UK's impending split from the European Union. 
EasyJet warned on Thursday that its annual profits will be down by more than 25% due to the depreciation of 
sterling. Since the UK voted to leave the EU on June 23, sterling has depreciated by 16% against both the dollar 
and the euro.
Additionally, Brexit could also impair the company's profits as the UK losses its favorable trade status with the EU.
As a result, shares of UK airliners including Ryanair, Fastjet, and Flybe were all trading lower in London.

aircraft engineers. It is also promoting over 300 First Officers.
Ryanair told City A.M. the staff would be spread throughout its 84-base European network, though it is still planning 
to cool off UK relations following the Brexit vote.
There will not be any additional aircraft in the UK next year - they will be allocated to EU airports instead, and 
Ryanair's UK growth rate will reduce from 15 per cent this year to six per cent next year.

Highlight: Cork firm to employ three staff in German office
Body
Cork IT recruitment firm Zartis.com is opening an office in Berlin as part of its ongoing European expansion. 
The company, which opened an office in Madrid in 2014, will open the German office with three staff in December. 
Founder John Dennehy said that while the company has staff working remotely, the demand for software 
developers in Berlin is growing. 
The company is already working with AskCharlie, a Berlin-based tech start-up that matches local service for users 
on-demand. 
“A huge amount of the people working in the tech sector are moving to Berlin. 
“That suits our model very well,” said Dennehy. 
Founded in 2009, Zartis.com started as a recruitment software company, but soon expanded its service to focus on 
IT recruitment. 
“We found that we weren’t getting good service from any recruiters that we went to, so we saw that there was a big 
opportunity for us to start finding good IT people for companies,” said Dennehy. 
Zartis.com uses its cloud recuitment software product HireHive.io to find candidates for growing companies with 
under 1,000 staff. 
The company is currently working with Seattle-based medical records software company Valant Medical Solutions 
to bring on new staff after it closed a $11 million funding round. 
It also seeks out IT staff for larger companies and was chosen to work with Ryanair in 2014 to recruit for its 
technology arm, Ryanair Labs.

It secured Lufthansa as its first big client in 2012. 
Dennehy, who is a serial entrepreneur, first started in business when he set up a web development company in 
1999. 
He also co-founded New York mobile communications company Fonepool, which then was sold to Jersey Telecom. 
In 2002, he co-founded Upstart Games with Barry O’Neill and Hiroshi Okamoto. 
It was sold to China’s Sun 3C Media for €11.5 million in 2006.

BUDGET airline EasyJet is braced for a sharp fall in pre-tax profits when it gives a trading update this week.
A combination of terrorist attacks, air control strikes and a hefty price war with Ryanair has taken its toll on the 
carrier, analysts say.
They are expecting profit before tax in the year to end of September to be heavily down - predictions ranged from 
£497m-£517m. Profit before tax for 2015 was £686m.
Rob Byde, airline analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, told City A.M.: "Profits are expected to be down due to a weaker 
yield environment impacting all European carriers. The past year has seen a number of negative events, from 
terrorist attacks to air control strikes."
This summer, EasyJet along with British Airways and Ryanair, cancelled hundreds of flights due to French air traffic 
control strikes.
Meanwhile, fierce rival Ryanair threw down the gauntlet in May, cutting fares by seven per cent.
Last month, EasyJet boss Carolyn McCall said that the Brexit vote had impacted demand for holidays.
Despite this tough market, Byde said EasyJet was "generally trading well".

Argentine startup carrier Flybondi is in advanced discussions with international lead investors and Argentinian 
investors to raise $75 million in preparation for its planned launch next year.
The carrier has mandated US Investment Bank Raymond James as advisor for the capital raise.
Ultra-low cost carrier Flybondi is looking to launch operations in the third quarter of next year.
It will initially operate domestic routes from its Buenos Aires base and has started negotiations with the Argentine 
authorities to obtain an aircraft operator’s certificate.
“Flybondi plans to reach 30 aircraft in five years and transport over 8 million passengers on domestic and regional 
flights,” the startup said in a statement.
Early indications show Flybondi will not go head-to-head with Aerolineas Argentinas, as the start-up carrier aims to 
bypass Buenos Aires downtown airport Aeroparque.
Flybondi is headed by founder and former CEO of Flybaboo Julian Cook, who was also involved ina new European 
low-cost carrier with a focus on long-haul sectors after leaving the Swiss regional carrier. Cookannounced its 
intention to start a low-cost transatlantic carrier in June 2012 but lack of available aircraft has put the original plan 
on hold.
Argentine entrepreneur Gaston Parisier is also the co-founder of the carrier.
The start-up airline completed a seed capital round in August with the participation ofex-chief commercial officer 
and current board member of Ryanair Michael Cawley,ex-chief executive officer Air Canada, board member of 
Swiss Intl. Airlines & Allegiant Montie Brewer as well as Robert Wright, who founded UK carrier CityFlyer, alongside 
a group of Argentinian investors.
Cook told Airfinance Journal in an email that Flybondy will either operate Airbus A320s or Boeing 737-800s. “Plans 
are to operate six aircraft in the first year,” he says.

British Airways will phase out free meals in economy on short-haul flights in favour of paid-for food from Marks and 
Spencer.
The move by BA, part of the International Airlines Group, is in line with wider trends across the industry, where 
legacy airlines have made their services to economy passengers increasingly similar to those of their low-cost 
rivals. Travellers on EasyJet and Ryanair are already well used to the clicking sound of a paid snack cart.
However, the airline vowed to retain a free meal service for passengers in its Club Europe business seats .
Similar moves at other airlines have prompted protests from passengers who felt they were losing out with the loss 
of free meals.
After he was appointed last year, Oscar Munoz , chief executive of United Airlines, restored free snacks in short-
haul economy because of continuing passenger unhappiness about their removal.
British Airways said their decision followed "extensive customer research and feedback," which highlighted 
dissatisfaction with the airline's short-haul economy catering.
BA risks passenger grumbles with plan to scrap free meals on short-haul economy flights Airlines
"The research . . . found flyers want more choices that reflects what they would normally select when out and 
about," the airline said.
Alex Cruz , British Airways' chief executive, said that M&S was a "well-known, premium British brand".
"It's an ideal partnership, providing our customers with a choice of products they recognise and value," he said.
Passengers will be able to pay for meals with Avios, the points they accrue as members of BA's Executive Club 
frequent flyer programme.
Items will range in price from £1 for a packet of crisps to £4.95 for spiced chicken with quinoa and rice salad. The 
new arrangements will start from January 11 on flights to and from London Heathrow, and from summer next year 
at Stansted and Gatwick.
John Strickland, an independent airline consultant, welcomed BA's move, saying the airline had ended up in recent 
years in a "no man's land" in catering in short-haul economy.
"It's become very difficult to work out what the catering offering is," Mr Strickland said. "Am I going to get a 
breakfast, or some kind of damp, shrink-wrapped croissant or would I be better to go straight to Pret A Manger?"
Passengers would now know, Mr Strickland said, that they were going to have to pay for food.
But he went on: "You know you're going to be able to buy something of good quality."
Mr Strickland said passengers tended to complain initially about the loss of free food. But they grew happier once 
they realised the replacement, paid-for food offered better choice and higher quality.

Adding dozens of aircraft to your fleet at a time when investors are growing concerned about excess capacity and 
weakening demand looks illogical. But for Lufthansa, a leasing deal with a rival is more about who flies the planes 
than who owns them.
On Wednesday, Lufthansa said that it would enter into a "wet lease" agreement with Air Berlin, under which the 
struggling smaller carrier will use 40 of its own aircraft to operate short-haul routes for Lufthansa.
For Air Berlin this is about survival. Cutting its fleet size will allow it to focus on longer haul routes and business 
destinations. Its leisure routes, hived off into a separate unit, might interest other carriers. These priorities suit its 
largest shareholder Etihad, without whose support Air Berlin would long since have collapsed.
Lufthansa will repaint Air Berlin's Airbus A320s in the livery of Eurowings, its low-cost unit, whose fleet will in effect 
grow by almost half.
A separate transaction - acquiring the remaining 45 per cent of Brussels Airlines - could expand it further.
Eurowings will make a loss in 2016 and it is not clear that the Air Berlin arrangement, which starts in 2017, will 
improve that. But beefing up the unit sends a message to the German pilots' union, with which Lufthansa remains 
locked in a dispute over pensions.
Eurowings pilots have less generous retirement arrangements.
Lufthansa/Air Berlin: buying time
Helping prevent a possible disorderly break-up of Air Berlin plays well poli-tically for Lufthansa. It also helps keep 
rivals at bay. Ryanair, with a big cash pile and rock-bottom costs, is keen on expanding in Germany. As long as it is 
confined to secondary airports in cities such as Frankfurt, Düsseldorf and Munich, its threat is blunted, leaving 
Lufthansa to focus on cutting its costs.
But it is only a stopgap. Lufthansa shares are down 30 per cent this year. A EUR500m bond sale was abandoned 
this week. Nervy investors would be more reassured by peace with the pilots, or profits at Eurowings.

GERMAN airline Lufthansa said yesterday that its supervisory board has approved plans to buy the remaining 
chunk of Brussels Airlines that it didn't already own.
The carrier bought 45 per cent of Brussels Airlines owner SN Airholding in 2009 for (EURO)65m (£56m), with the 
option of buying the other 55 per cent from 2011 onwards.
Lufthansa is trying to boost its Eurowings business with acquisitions, and said earlier this year that it was discussing 
how to bring Brussels, which has a fleet of 49 planes, into its low-cost platform, which currently has around 90 
planes.
The transaction, which is subject to shareholders of SN Airholding approving the details of the deal, is expected to 
be concluded next year.
The supervisory board is also expected to discuss plans for Lufthansa to take on more jets for Eurowings from Air 
Berlin, sources told Reuters, to help make Eurowings the third largest low costcarrier in Europe behind Ryanair and 
EasyJet.
Last year, Lufthansa signed a 10-year deal with Inmarsat to provide internet on planes mid-air.

Sligo craft brewer seeks barrel sponsors for beer roll-out
The White Hag, a brewery based in Ballymote, Co Sligo, is looking to raise €25,000 through an adopt-a-barrel 
programme, writes Emmet Ryan. 
The crowd-funding initiative aims to help the firm buy 100 barrels for its barrel-aged beers. 
The idea to have 100 barrels adopted at €250 each was inspired in part by the Scottish brewery BrewDog’s share-
offering schemes. 
“BrewDog has its Equity for Punks which has run very successfully. 
“Ireland is not quite at the scale where we can do that and we don’t have the marketing budget required for it,” said 
Paul Mullin, managing director of The White Hag. 
“Adopting a barrel gets people closer to the story and lets them see the barrels that the beers are going to be aged 
in.” 
Donors will get their names inscribed on the barrels along with receiving beer brewed in the adopted barrels every 
year for three years. 
Hayes predicts cross-border European mortgage market
Europeans could soon be free to cross borders to shop around for the lowest mortgage rates around the European 
Union, if a new European directive is pushed through, writes Leanna Byrne. 
The European Commission is expected to propose a directive aimed at harmonising national insolvency regimes by 
the end of the year. 
News In Brief
This could see the establishment of a cross-border mortgage regime in the EU, according to Dublin Fine Gael MEP 
Brian Hayes. 
Currently, EU citizens cannot avail of mortgages in other EU member states. 
“If we are to have a real internal market in the EU, cross-border mortgages should be the norm. 
“We’ve already got a banking union in place and one would think that if EU banks are under the same rules, cross-
border mortgages should be a given,” said Hayes. 
Dutch fuel company Argos takes Ryanair to High Court
Ryanair is being pursued in the High Court by Argos, a Rotterdam-based fuel supplier. 
The Dutch company, which is owned by Swiss company Varo Energy, lodged two sets of preliminary proceedings 
here last week but the cause of the dispute isn’t known. 
Ryanair’s spokesman said the airline didn’t wish to comment, and Argos did not respond when contacted. 
Argos is a leading petroleum and biofuel trading, storage and distribution company and has a network of service 
stations. 
It is active in the Belgium, Luxemburg, France, Germany and Switzerland.

There are no hidden fees in the fund management industry. Its critics keep going on about them, but they also "fail 
to identify conclusive signs of their existence". And that is because they don't exist. They are not "lurking within". 
They are instead the "Loch Ness Monster of investments", a figment of the imagination of financial journalists and 
feisty challenger businesses.
That, at least, is the (firm) view of the industry cheerleading Investment Association, which released a report on the 
matter over the summer. Is the IA right?
The analysis in its report - which attempts to show that not only are there no hidden costs but that even if there 
were, active funds outperform enough to compensate for those costs - is pretty ropey.
But it is really a matter of definitions. It isn't so much that charges in question are hidden than that they are in some 
cases disclosed, but not obviously (think accountancy fees, depository fees, custodian fees, external research 
costs) and in other cases unknown and hence tricky to disclose.
Transaction costs (commission plus stamp duty and the cost inherent in bid-offer spreads) are the main culprits 
here. A manager can't know in advance how much he will trade and in what volumes, so he can't tell you on 
January 1 how much he will have charged you for his trading over the year until December 31.
Fund charges have more baggage than Ryanair Investing
I've been trying to think of any other sector that works like this - where you buy a thing but are then hit with 
obligatory ongoing costs you can't know in advance. You could compare fund pricing to aviation pricing. A report 
from the Civil Aviation Authority this week pointed out that some 43 per cent of their revenues (on Jet2.com it is £39 
per passenger, for example) now come from additional fees, "or ancillary revenue" as the airlines like to put it, that 
is not included in the headline ticket prices.
Consider credit card booking fees, checked luggage fees, charges to book a seat and so on. These aren't hidden 
fees: you can find them reasonably clearly noted on most websites and they aren't always unreasonable. EasyJet 
charges you £80 to rebook if you miss your departure, for example.
But, like fund management costs, they aren't particularly transparent either. However, they aren't quite the same 
thing, simply because they aren't ongoing charges. They are services you can choose to have or not to have.
The same goes for all the other possible comparators. All-inclusive holidays that don't include wine, for example. 
Yes, wine is an extra unknown cost. But it is still a choice. Mark Warner can no more pipe rosé of an unknown price 
down your throat and bill you later than Ryanair can block the departure gate until you produce a piece of outsized 
luggage and agree to move from your assigned seat at the back by the loos to a more expensive emergency exit 
seat (much as it might like to).
Fund managers (and maybe governments) are the only group of service providers that can headline with one price, 
but announce some time later that the actual price was different (often double the original price) and that they have 
removed the difference from your account (over which they have full control). They get to tell you the predictable bit, 
but leave all the risk in the less predictable bits on your plate.
This is no good at all. That you never know what you will have to pay is one irritant, of course. But the other is that it 
remains very hard for investors to compare the cost of one fund with that of another.
Over the years I have suggested various ways of dealing with the problem of how investors are charged for funds. I 
thought it would be a good idea for funds to charge flat absolute fees, for example. Charging a percentage of assets 
just encourages asset gathering at the expense of good performance.
And I'm all for exploring how a very low absolute management fee could be combined with a performance sharing 
system for management and investors. But as I am not getting quite as much traction on this as I think I should be, 
I'd like to suggest an interim solution: the all-inclusive fund management fee.
Under this system, fund managers would be obliged to behave in the same way as travel agents offering genuinely 
all-inclusive holidays. They announce a price at the beginning and that is that. The price includes everything: 
management costs, all fees and commissions, all research and all trading costs.
Those costs may fluctuate across the year. They may be higher than the fund management company expects or 
they may be lower. But that's a problem for the firm not for the investor, just as the fluctuating costs of jet fuel and 
cheap prosecco are problems for Thomas Cook rather than for the prepaying punter.
The benefits of shifting to a system like this are obvious. First, it offers full clarity to the investor: all-in prices mean 
they can compare like with like. Second, it firmly forces the providers to explain why their costs are what they are. If 
they want to charge more for a fund that has high turnover they will be obliged to explain why they consider, for 
example, high turnover of investments to be a good thing (when it almost invariably isn't).
Third, it might lead to a reappraisal of costs across the board. If the fee is all-inclusive, the incentive to push costs 
down is high. So we might find fund managers looking for all-inclusive annual trading deals (a flat fee!) from their 
brokers or pushing down their legal and accountancy fees to levels those in non-financial industries might think 
reasonable.
This isn't a perfect solution to the problem of fees (the whole percentage charging thing will still be with us). But it 
would, I think, be an excellent way of beginning to make fund managers think and behave more like the providers of 
Fund charges have more baggage than Ryanair Investing
other services, which in turn would start to create real competition - and bring down the costs of investing. And that 
of course is the thing that matters almost more than anything else to our ageing, saving population: the less we pay 
away in costs, the more we will have to live on in our old age.

Pilots at easyJet voted overwhelmingly to back strike action in a dispute over fatigue, the pilots' union announced 
yesterday, in a fresh blow to Europe's second-largest low-cost carrier.
The British Airline Pilots' Association said 96 per cent of its 2,000 UK-based members at easyJet voted in favour of 
industrial action in the ballot. Turnout was 88 per cent.
However, it remains unclear whether the ballot will lead to flight disruption at the airline. Balpa said easyJet had 
made a "last-minute" offer to resolve the dispute.
"We will consider this carefully in meetings tomorrow before taking any further decisions," the union said, adding 
that there were no plans at present to undertake industrial action.
EasyJet said it was committed to working with Balpa to find a resolution to the issue. "EasyJet can reassure its 
passengers that no industrial action is currently planned by its UK pilots," it said.
The dispute revolves around pilots' unhappiness over the scheduling of their flights. Balpa has said the current 
practices are leading to excessive fatigue.
EasyJet's shares fell 10p to close at £10.31 after Balpa's announcement.
Fatigue factor: EasyJet pilots vote to back action
The ballot result presents a new challenge for easyJet, which faces fierce competition from Ryanair, whose costs 
are lower. The airline has suffered severe disruption from the economic uncertainty following the UK's vote to leave 
the EU as well as the threat of terrorism.

Israel battles to revive tourism Holiday travel: Eilat

Highlight: Investment in airport and hotels aims to entice foreign visitors put off by violence
Body
Israel is trying to revive its struggling tourism industry by subsidising new budget hotels, paying airlines EUR60 for 
every passenger they fly into Eilat, and building a showpiece international airport to receive them north of the Red 
Sea resort.
Tourist visits to Israel have slumped since 2014, when its war against the militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip 
and the subsequent wave of violence in Jerusalem caused many foreigners to cancel trips. During that time, Tel 
Aviv's Ben Gurion airport, Israel's main gateway to the world, was shut for two days after a rocket fired from Gaza 
landed about a mile away.
Israel's government is now trying to bring foreign visitors back and change the way they think about the country, in 
part by broadening its target market beyond religious pilgrims who come for its holy sites, to those seeking sand 
and sun. An advertising spot, launched in June in several European cities, shows a couple running along 
Jerusalem's Old City wall, then a Tel Aviv beach, under the slogan "Two Cities, One Break".
"Unfortunately, over the years tourism wasn't something that Israel invested in or put its efforts in, unlike what we 
did in the high-tech industry," Yariv Levin, Israel's tourism minister, told the Financial Times. "For most people in the 
world, Israel is not a tourist site that is even crossing their minds."
Israel hosted 2.8m tourists last year, down 4 per cent on 2014, according to economy ministry figures.
Israel battles to revive tourism Holiday travel: Eilat
The country is more expensive than rival Mediterranean tourist destinations and does not have enough low-priced 
rooms, government and tourism officials concede.
Mr Levin said that in an effort to build more, the government was giving "huge grants" to developers that built hotels 
with three stars or fewer, equivalent to 33 per cent of the overall cost.
In Eilat last week, hotels were full, with local tourists - including Palestinians celebrating the Muslim Eid al-Adha 
holiday - packing the town's open-air promenades and malls. Eilat is faring better than neighbouring Aqaba in 
Jordan or Taba, Egypt, which have seen an exodus of foreign visitors worried about Islamist terrorist attacks.
However, foreigners account for less than 10 per cent of visitors to Eilat, and tourist numbers fall sharply in winter. 
Occupancy at Eilat hotels last winter was about 62 per cent, said Yossi Chen, general manager of the city's 
Municipal Tourism Association. The city is hoping for 70 per cent this year with the help of new direct flights.
Last year Israel began offering foreign carriers flying to Eilat a EUR45 per passenger subsidy, plus another EUR15 
per visitor offered by the local hotels association.
Ryanair, the budget airline, began flights from Krakow in Poland, Kaunas in Lithuania and Budapest in Hungary, 
and from November will begin a service from Bratislava in Slovakia.
International arrivals to Eilat land at Ovda, an Israeli military airport that also accommodates civilian aircraft. The 
new Ramon airport, being built in the desert north of the city, is due to open in 2017, with a 34,000 sq metre 
terminal and stands for 29 aircraft.
Aviation authorities are touting the 1.65bn shekel ($437m) project as a gateway for foreign tourists and an 
alternative to Ben Gurion airport, which when foggy requires planes to divert abroad.
"This airport can be an alternative to Ben Gurion, even in times of peace," says Hanan Moscovitz, an Israeli airport 
authority official.
But some in the city are sceptical of the notion that "if you build it, they will come". While Eilat's visitor numbers 
compare favourably with Aqaba's and Taba's, it is often outcompeted by rivals in Europe and other countries.
"If a family wants to go abroad for a week or two-week holiday in Greece or Capri, it's a lot less expensive to do it 
there than to come do it here," concedes Red Fisher, general manager of Eilat's Manta Diving Resort.
Rotem Noam, chief executive of Erev Be'Eilat, which runs two local newspapers and a tourism guide, says: "Eilat is 
expensive relative to Greece, Cyprus and other destinations . . . We're aware of that, and we are struggling."
Mr Noam asserts that while Eilat's hotel services and facilities are often better than in Greece or Cyprus, and prices 
fall in low season, they are expensive in peak months.
He blames Eilat's steep costs on high wages, the costs of fitting and certifying hotels to meet kosher requirements, 
and regulatory issues - including a requirement that all swimming pools have lifeguards.
Mr Noam also asserts that the amount of money being invested in the Ramon airport is "not justified" when tourist 
numbers are modest, and most who come to Eilat are locals.
"I predict it's going to be deserted," he says. "You don't build an airport and expect people to come. You have to 
build hotels and rooms and attractions, and after that you build your airport."

Highlight: Brexit brings pain for some investors, but there will be winners too
Body
At the end of the first day of trading following the Brexit vote, the Ftse 100 was down by over 7 per cent. 
But dominated as that index is by global mining, multinational and international banking groups, it wasn’t surprising 
that its decline was only half that of the mid-cap 250 index, which is far more closely aligned to the domestic British 
economy, and fell by 13 per cent in the two trading days post-referendum. The Iseq fell by 16 per cent. 
The impact was heaviest on financial services stocks – Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays down 30 per cent, Bank 
of Ireland down 37 per cent and IFG, 15 per cent down over the same two days. 
The concerns about Brexit in the financial sector are on several levels. First, the macroeconomic level arising from 
a slowdown in the economy as uncertainty about the outcome of Brexit negotiations stalls investment decisions, as 
well as ‘big ticket’ consumer spending. For Bank of Ireland, a slowing British housing market will be the main 
concern as demand for residential mortgages slows. 
For IFG, the market clearly anticipates a loss of momentum in its wealth management services. Unlike most Irish 
stocks, the latter’s shares have fallen in September to below the levels in the immediate Brexit aftermath. 
Longer term, the implications for the larger indigenous British financial services groups are even greater than for 
Irish banks, given their heavy reliance on the passport that the EU provides to enable them to sell wholesale 
financial services across Europe without having to set up separately incorporated businesses in individual member 
states. This makes the City of London vulnerable – as reflected in the knocks to London and south-east-focused 
house-builders, as well as hotel groups, airlines and restaurant chains. 
However, hotel group Dalata – which has about 25 per cent of its hotel room space in Britain – has been able to 
offset some of the negative effects of Brexit in recent months by the weakness in sterling which has driven British 
visitors to its Irish hotels. Hence it has recovered about half of its share price fall since the referendum result. 
Invested: Win, lose or draw breath?
As to airlines, Ryanair, IAG and EasyJet have all seen their share prices fall – although disentangling the Brexit and 
international terrorism threats is impossible. However, Ryanair has recovered most of its fall since suggesting it is 
best-placed to fight a price war and adapt its capacity utilisation to more airports. At its current price-to-earnings 
ratio, the shares look attractive. 
So were worries about the implications of Brexit in the immediate aftermath of the result overdone? Or has the 
impact been offset by continued monetary easing and – linked to that – the fall in sterling against the currencies of 
Britain’s major trading partners? 
What is clear is that discrimination between the share prices of companies that risk being hard hit and those that 
might be relatively immune – or indeed capable of adapting – is essential. But those judgment calls will remain 
difficult until the terms of the Brexit – hard or soft – are known. 
Twelve weeks on from the referendum, the stock markets have recovered their poise: by the end of August, the 
Ftse100, 250 and 350 were not only up on their post-Brexit lows, they were up on their pre-Brexit highs. 
Four key factors have contributed to this: Firstly, weak sterling has pushed up the value of shares in companies 
which have a large proportion of their earning streams in the now more valuable dollar and euro. 
Secondly, since June, the market has had an opportunity to assess more carefully and discriminatingly those 
companies that are likely to take a big ‘hit’ from the uncertainty that the Brexit vote has engendered and indeed 
those who benefited from it. 
The third factor is the impact on asset values of continued quantitative easing, and the fourth is the doubt that many 
well-placed investors have in their minds as to whether Brexit will become a reality at all. 
The British public will have serious cause for reflection once the actual Brexit package is unravelled. Brussels 
seems adamant that under no circumstances will there be free access to the single market without free movement 
of people. With all of the key British stock indices now well ahead of where they were before the Brexit vote, 
investors must ponder: is Brexit a sure-fire thing? Maybe not. 
That said, as investors, we should hope for the best, but plan for the worst. Certain stock market sectors and sub-
sectors seem best avoided while we see how the negotiations proceed – or unravel. 
If a ‘hard’ Brexit proceeds, the sectors most exposed are likely to be those manufacturers whose supply chains and 
sales are international, domestic players who depend on plentiful supplies of relatively unskilled labour (food 
manufacturers, retailers and hoteliers), and those segments of the house-building industry which have a particular 
concentration on London and the south-east, given the uncertainty about Britain’s capacity to negotiate post-Brexit 
‘passporting’ rights for its City of London-based wholesale financial services businesses. 
A squeeze on the City of London – as the market is clearly anticipating – will have inevitable negative 
consequences for, in particular, the upper end of London and south-east house-builders – and estate agents, 
mortgage providers and commercial property developers focused on London and the south east. 
What about the impact of a change in the free movement of labour rules, which would halt the inward migration of 
relatively unskilled labour? It risks causing issues for the world’s largest sandwich manufacturer, Greencore, which 
saw its share price retreat substantially in the run-up to (and near-term aftermath of) the referendum. The shares 
have, however, begun to spring back in recent weeks – probably due to the company’s well-executed expansion 
programme in the US where it is now in the last lap of the rollout of significant new capacity. This programme offers 
the short-term prospect of diluting the negative impacts of Brexit and as market leader, should leave Greencore well 
positioned to squeeze out and acquire smaller competitors, thus increasing its overall scale, distribution economies 
and competitive advantage. 
A hard ‘Brexit’ is likely to have very serious consequences for the banking and financial services sector generally. 
One needs to remember that SMEs, corporate and other lending institutions benefit little in incremental terms from 
Invested: Win, lose or draw breath?
the upside in client borrowers because they do not hold equity in those businesses, but they can lose a lot from the 
downside because of the debt they have advanced to them. So while there are bound to be winners and losers from 
Brexit, the banks will not gain materially from their winning clients, but risk losing substantially from their losing 
ones, for example, property developers and house-builders. 
Significant change in the dynamics of an economy over the short-term can cause particular problems for SMEs 
which may not have the resources to adapt business models, and hence negative consequences for banks lending 
to SMEs. Many Irish investors will be exposed to the risks carried by the British arms of our two pillar banks, AIB 
and Bank of Ireland; the latter more than the former. 
But let’s not forget potential winners: Irish Continental Group could be a significant beneficiary of Brexit. The return 
of duty-free sales that would follow should boost its cross-channel revenues. Outsourcing groups – such as Serco 
and Mitie – might also benefit as businesses seek to downsize fixed central overheads in response to trading 
pressures and transfer some operating costs to outsourcers who may enjoy scale economies, enabling them to 
leverage technology-driven efficiencies that individual businesses cannot make scalable in respect of support 
functions. 
And keep an eye on the Green Reit and other real estate investment trusts which may well be a beneficiary of many 
British financial services operators transferring some of their operations to Dublin. 
Finally, with sterling weakness and an anticipated pick-up in inflation, the regulated British utilities are one hedge 
against sterling inflation as they are allowed to raise their water charges in line with the Britain’s inflation index. 
But for investors, one thing is certain: the uncertainty will have a cost in the form of reduced investment and slower 
growth at least until the air is cleared.

       PARIS (dpa-AFX) - European airlines say hundreds of flights were delayed or cancelled on Thursday due to a 
strike by air traffic controllers in France.  Airlines Easyjet, Ryanair, British Airways and Aer Lingus each reported 
numerous flights cancelled due to the strike, which was set to impact thousands of passengers.  More than 300 
flights were estimated to be cancelled, as airlines in Europe reduced their offering by 15 per cent, according to 
lobby group Airlines for Europe (A4E).  The strike, which is expected to last for 35 hours, is the latest of several 
walk-outs this year by French air traffic controllers in protest at France's controversial labour reforms passed in July 
in an effort to jumpstart the country's flagging economy.  The labour action drew criticism from A4E lobbyists 
representing several airlines affected by the strike.  'The demands of increasingly mobile European citizens and 
businesses cannot be taken hostage by localized industrial action. It is about time to minimize the impact of these 
strike actions,' A4E chief Thomas Reynaert said, also criticizing a lack in measures from European authorities to 
prevent such strikes.  Europe has already seen several strikes this year by air traffic controllers in Italy, Belgium, 
Greece and France, leading to thousands of cancelled and delayed flights.   Copyright dpa

How Airbnb is adding to the rental crisis
How Airbnb is adding to the rental crisis
Sunday Business Post

Highlight: Critics say it is a cash cow for private landlords which is destabilising a housing market already in crisis
Body
It has been hailed as the Ryanair of the hotel industry – an energetic, cost-cutting, upstart threatening long-held and 
jealously guarded hegemonies. Airbnb has cut a swathe through the global property sector since it was founded on 
the quaint idea of hiring out an air mattress in your house. Since that day in 2008, it has grown exponentially, with 
more than 1.5 million beds now available for hire in cities around the world. It has been hailed as the epitome of the 
sharing economy – unlocking unused economic bandwidth, breaking down monopolies, and enriching culturally and 
monetarily those who use it. 
But critics say there is a dark side to Airbnb. For all its spiel about extra income and new friends, it has also grown 
into a massive industry in its own right. Stories abound of landlords controlling tens of properties, of 
professionalised service and high volumes of visitors. The explosion of Airbnb has facilitated the rise of a new 
business; but is the true cost of success only becoming clear now? 
“The last time I looked, there were 4,000 units available in Dublin on Airbnb, and just under 45 per cent of them 
were entire apartments,” said Lorcan Sirr, a lecturer in housing studies in DIT. “I calculated we could have housed 
650 families in all the Airbnbs that were available full time,” he said. The problem is that Airbnb is so wildly 
successful; providing the same yield as an annual lease in a fraction of the time, that it could be hampering the 
supply of units onto the open market. In a badly misfiring housing market, people like Sirr say that’s patently bad 
news. 
“The average stay in a Dublin Airbnb last year was €94 a night, and compare that against your average rent in 
2015, you’ll make an awful lot more money if you go at the Airbnb in any serious way.” 
In a housing crisis, Sirr argued, “the immediate term is managing that supply that we have already. Part of the 
management of the stock is empty houses and vacant houses, and we’re not good at that”. 
How Airbnb is adding to the rental crisis
And it’s not just Dublin where there are fears over the impact of Airbnb. Amsterdam, Berlin and Barcelona have all 
introduced rules around the service in an effort to temper its incursions into the private rental market. Murray Cox is 
an Australian photographer who is living in Brooklyn. He founded data-scraping website InsideAirbnb.com in an 
effort to delve deeper into Airbnb, its use and its impact.  
“I originally set about asking questions about how Airbnb was being used in the neighbourhood, especially as it 
intersects with housing issues which can be at the core of other issues in the neighbourhood.” 
The site collects and displays data on Airbnb throughout the world, it makes it visible and provides tools to look at 
Airbnb usage. 
“That was to show that Airbnb was an economic incentive for people thinking of renting to tenants that they can 
make more money through Airbnb,” he said of an analysis he ran on Los Angeles usage of the platform. The same 
analysis revealed that occupancy of just 83 nights on average yielded the same sum as a year-long lease.  
“There’s a big myth out there propagated by Airbnb and their hosts and their marketing team that people use it to 
rent spare rooms. In reality, in most cities, the majority are using it to rent out whole apartments,” he said. In Dublin, 
it’s 45 per cent.  
“People need to think about it. Even if they use it to travel, they should be thinking about how their use impacts the 
city where they’re going,” he said. He said that efforts to regulate it have often fallen flat, with bans, nightly limits 
and permitting systems all easily flouted by entrepreneuring Airbnbers.  
“It’s almost like the Wild West in many cities around the world,” he said.   
However, not everyone wants to see governments and regulators bully-foot their way in, raising the possibility that 
they could make the situation worse while trying to make it better.  
Ronan Lyons, assistant professor of economics at Trinity College Dublin and author of the Daft report, said the core 
issue is one of supply, not use of supply, and the sooner that is sorted out, the sooner cities like Dublin can move 
towards an accommodation that pleases everyone.  
“If you have lots of people who want to come to your city, either for a weekend or to live and work, that’s a good 
news story. That’s extra demand and that’s what city fathers should ultimately want. It only becomes a problem if 
the housing structure can’t respond to that extra demand by building more homes, or more bed spaces,” he said.  
“In terms of supply and demand, you want to be encouraging demand, whether people live there or are just coming 
as a tourist. If you just react to this by limiting demand, it shows a complete unwillingness to tackle the root problem, 
which is we haven’t figured out why it’s so expensive to build new accommodation, and therefore it’s not being 
built,” he said.  
Ultimately, Lyons says, it’s not for politicians to judge the merits of a use of supply – it’s their responsibility to ensure 
supply comes on stream. 
“Earning money from renting something on Airbnb versus Daft, it’s not clear to me why one is a good and one is a 
bad.” 
For now, it remains to be seen whether short-term letting could become a long-term problem.

 Amsterdam Bugaboo, the Dutch company that transformed the pram and pushchair market when it was 
founded 20 years ago, is to launch its first range of luggage. Bugaboo pushchairs went on to be sold in 
more than 50 countries (and even honoured on a Dutch stamp in 2007). The company has similarly lofty 
ambitions for its luggage, billing it not simply as a range of suitcases but a "new mobility concept". The 
Bugaboo Boxer is a modular system based around a wheeled-chassis on to which different sized bags can 
be clipped. Fully loaded, the chassis can carry a full-size case, a carry-on bag and several smaller laptop 
and soft bags. The chassis alone weighs 3.2kg but the neat trick for air passengers is that it can be folded 
up to become part of the carry-on bag, thus avoiding eating into the weight allowance for checked bags. 
Bugaboo says the folded chassis will meet size regulations for carry-ons for "most" airlines (although not 
Ryanair). As with the company's pushchairs, prices are high: the chassis costs £480, full-size case £350, 
cabin bag £310. It will be available on September 26. bugaboo.com/bugabooboxer 
Hong Kong Cathay Pacific will fly its last passenger service using a Boeing 747 next month. The airline first began 
using the aircraft - the original jumbo jet - in 1979, and says its fleet of 747s has carried 160m people. Cathay has 
been gradually replacing its fleet with more fuel-efficient alternatives; the final passenger 747 flight will be from 
Tokyo to Hong Kong on October 1. Other airlines have made similar moves - Air France, Japan Airlines, Air New 
Zealand and Singapore Airlines have already retired their final 747s; Delta is due to follow suit in 2017. 
Nevertheless, 47 years after it first flew, the so-called "Queen of the Skies" is unlikely to disappear totally for several 
years yet: British Airways alone still operates 38. cathaypacific.com

California Timber Cove, a 1960s retreat perched on cliffs in Sonoma County, is to be relaunched this month 
following a major renovation. The resort opened in 1963 with buildings inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright and 
overlooked by "The Expanding Universe", a 93ft obelisk created by the Californian sculptor Beniamino Bufano. 
Photographer Ansel Adams was among many artists who became regular guests. After an eight-month closure for 
rebuilding and redecoration, it now has 46 guest rooms designed to appeal to the "modern hippie", with a mix of 
modern and retro furniture and heavy use of redwood and stone. The original A-frame structure remains, housing 
the bar and public areas. Double rooms cost from $210; timbercove resort.com

The chief executive of easyJet yesterday accused some of Europe's legacy airlines of irrational behaviour, saying 
they were adding "deeply unprofitable" routes amid lacklustre economic growth on the continent.
At an aviation conference in London, Dame Carolyn McCall claimed certain rivals were chasing short-term, 
unsustainable revenues. She was speaking as European airlines grapple with economic uncertainty, air traffic 
control disruption and terrorism that have driven down fares and profits sharply.
EasyJet's shares fell in June after the low-cost airline warned that its profit would be hit by several factors including 
Britain's decision to leave the EU. However, speaking at the World Low-Cost Airline Congress, Dame Carolyn said 
some legacy airlines were adding new routes that would ultimately lose them money. The routes were currently 
making money because of lower oil prices, but that approach was "unsustainable" because fares would fall to 
reflect carriers' reduced fuel expenses, she added.
"There's a bit of irrationality in Europe at the moment," said Dame Carolyn. "[Airlines are] putting in capacity which 
is deeply unprofitable."
She said easyJet, by contrast, made money whether oil prices were high or low. Dame Carolyn did not name any of 
the legacy airlines whose tactics she was criticising. But Air France-KLM, International Airlines Group and 
Lufthansa have all come under pressure on European short-haul routes from low-cost airlines led by Ryanair and 
easyJet. EasyJet, however, faces its own challenges following Britain's vote to leave the EU in the June 
EasyJet chief criticises 'irrational' legacy rivals Airlines
referendum. The airline has become Europe's second-largest low-cost carrier by revenue by capitalising on the 
creation of a single EU aviation market in the 1990s.
This market allows EU airlines to operate services between any two destinations within the regional bloc, and 
easyJet has grown rapidly over the past 20 years through these arrangements.
But Dame Carolyn dismissed the Brexit vote's significance for easyJet, which plans to circumvent any regulatory 
changes by seeking an air operator's certificate in mainland Europe.
"We are a growth business," she said. "We'll continue to be a growth business, regardless of Brexit."

Pearson hit a three-month low after weak results from two competitors deepened concerns that academic 
publishing is suffering from a structural downturn.
John Wiley & Sons and Barnes & Noble Education both reported sharp falls in textbook sales, with Wiley warning 
that its traditional publishing business was "under considerable pressure, particularly in education".
Students are increasingly aware of textbook rentals and ebooks, and are getting books when needed rather than at 
the start of each academic year, Wiley said. Both companies also cautioned that campus bookstores have been 
keeping inventories tighter this year, having had a slew of returns in 2015.
The news "strengthens our conviction both that [Pearson] will both deliver another profit warning and that its 
problems are primarily structural in nature", said Liberum. "Our biggest concern with Pearson is in its US Higher 
Education business (estimated 45 per cent of group profits) and, primarily, that students are shifting away from 
expensive textbook purchases. Wiley's comments yesterday suggest that this shift is real and also that it appears to 
be gaining momentum."
Pearson, down 7.7 per cent to 797p, was also affected by news this week that the for-profit college ITT Technical 
Institute had shut down its 130 campuses . Regulatory scrutiny of US colleges is increasing, which will hit enrolment 
numbers and cut the chance of Pearson's higher education business recovering, said Goldman Sachs.
Pearson hit by concerns over state of academic publishing sector London
An uneventful wider market saw the FTSE 100 edge 0.2 per cent higher, up 12.12 points to 6,858.70. Micro Focus 
led the way, up 14.7 per cent to £22.43, after agreeing a reverse takeover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's software 
division .
Airlines gained after EasyJet chief executive Carolyn McCall said at an airlines conference in London that the 
Brexit vote had no effect on long-term outlook, and that ticket pricing is "very similar" to last year. EasyJet rose 3.7 
per cent to £11.97 and IAG was up 4 per cent to 422.1p, helped by positive numbers overnight from Delta Air Lines.
Ryanair gained 3.3 per cent to EUR13.28, with Davy setting out a case for the stock to double. "A step-up in 
ancillary revenues, the game-changing economics of [Boeing] MAX deliveries and potentially more than EUR5.5bn 
in cash returns to shareholders over five years underpin a compelling medium-term investment case," it said.
RSA Insurance took on 0.9 per cent to 506.5p after HSBC turned positive, in part on sterling's recent weakness.
WPP slipped 1.1 per cent to £17.90 after Carat, the media buying agency owned by Dentsu, trimmed its 2016 and 
2017 global ad spend forecasts to reflect a sharp deterioration in the outlook for the UK and Brazil.

       VIENNA (dpa-AFX) - U.K. shares fluctuated on Wednesday, as a string of weak data offset gains in 
commodity-related stocks and well-received earnings results from Ashtead.  U.K. industrial output grew 0.1 percent 
in July from the previous month after staying flat in June, official data showed. Nonetheless, the monthly growth 
was in contrast to a 0.2 percent fall economists had expected. 
 Separately, survey data from the mortgage lender Halifax revealed that U.K. house prices climbed 6.9 percent in 
three months to August from last year after rising 8.4 percent in the three months ended July. The latest rate of 
increase was the weakest since October 2013, when prices grew the same 6.9 percent.  Elsewhere, data out of 
Germany showed that the country's industrial production fell by the most in almost two years in July, confounding 
expectations for an increase.   The benchmark FTSE 100 was up 8 points or 0.12 percent at 6,834 in midday 
trading after losing 0.8 percent the previous day.  Ashtead Group shares jumped 6 percent. The construction 
equipment provider lifted its full-year guidance after reporting a 4 percent rise in first-quarter pretax profit.  Oil major 
Tullow oil rose nearly 2 percent and Royal Dutch Shell gained 1 percent as oil prices rose on a weaker dollar.   
Precious metals miner Randgold Resources added 1.5 percent and Fresnillo rose 1 percent after gold futures 
rallied to log their highest settlement in nearly three weeks overnight.  House builder Barratt Developments dropped 
1.5 percent despite posting record pre-tax profits in the year to June, in line with its previous guidance.   Investment 
products provider Hargreaves Lansdown fell over 1 percent after announcing the departure of its chief executive, 
Ian Gorham.  Sports Direct International lost almost 10 percent as the embattled retailer forecast profit below 
analysts' estimates following a turbulent year.  EasyJet slid half a percent and Ryanair Holdings shed 0.8 percent 
after Deutsche Bank cut its ratings on the stocks.  Just Eat tumbled 3.5 percent after Amazon said it would launch a 
free one-hour restaurant delivery service for Prime members in London.

(RTTNews) - U.K. shares fluctuated on Wednesday, as a string of weak data offset gains in commodity-related 
stocks and well-received earnings results from Ashtead.
U.K. industrial output grew 0.1 percent in July from the previous month after staying flat in June, official data 
showed. Nonetheless, the monthly growth was in contrast to a 0.2 percent fall economists had expected.
Separately, survey data from the mortgage lender Halifax revealed that U.K. house prices climbed 6.9 percent in 
three months to August from last year after rising 8.4 percent in the three months ended July. The latest rate of 
increase was the weakest since October 2013, when prices grew the same 6.9 percent.
Elsewhere, data out of Germany showed that the country's industrial production fell by the most in almost two years 
in July, confounding expectations for an increase.
The benchmark FTSE 100 was up 8 points or 0.12 percent at 6,834 in midday trading after losing 0.8 percent the 
previous day.
Ashtead Group shares jumped 6 percent. The construction equipment provider lifted its full-year guidance after 
reporting a 4 percent rise in first-quarter pretax profit.
Oil major Tullow oil rose nearly 2 percent and Royal Dutch Shell gained 1 percent as oil prices rose on a weaker 
dollar.
Precious metals miner Randgold Resources added 1.5 percent and Fresnillo rose 1 percent after gold futures 
rallied to log their highest settlement in nearly three weeks overnight.
House builder Barratt Developments dropped 1.5 percent despite posting record pre-tax profits in the year to June, 
in line with its previous guidance.
Investment products provider Hargreaves Lansdown fell over 1 percent after announcing the departure of its chief 
executive, Ian Gorham.
Sports Direct International lost almost 10 percent as the embattled retailer forecast profit below analysts' estimates 
following a turbulent year.
EasyJet slid half a percent and Ryanair Holdings shed 0.8 percent after Deutsche Bank cut its ratings on the stocks.
FTSE 100 Marginally Higher Despite Weak Data
Just Eat tumbled 3.5 percent after Amazon said it would launch a free one-hour restaurant delivery service for 
Prime members in London.

French airline La Compagnie is to end business class-only flights between Luton airport and New York, blaming the 
Brexit vote for its decision.
In a statement on its website, La Compagnie said yesterday that it would instead introduce a second daily flight 
from Paris to New York.
The decision followed a similar move last week by British Airways to halve the number of its business class-only 
flights from London City airport to New York to one a day.
The last La Compagnie flight between London and New York will take off on September 24.
Customers who had booked tickets beyond that date will be offered a full refund or can choose instead to fly 
between Paris and New York. A transfer flight will be offered between London and Paris.
The young airline, which launched the business class-only flight from Luton in April last year, said its decision to 
end fights between London and New York came "in view of a new economic climate in Europe, fuelled by Brexit" 
which it added has "already affected various significant players within the airline industry".
Ryanair, the Irish low-cost airline, has curbed its UK growth plans following the EU referendum result in June and 
will shift its focus to expansion at other airports in Europe. FastFT

A BUSINESS class-only, transatlantic airline has blamed the Brexit vote for suspending its London to New York 
route.
La Compagnie said the outcome of the EU referendum had created "long term uncertainty for the airline industry" 
and decided that it would replace the London Luton departure with a second daily flight from Paris to the Big Apple.
"The result of the EU referendum has created an unprecedented level of legal and economic uncertainty for airlines 
that service Britain," said La Compagnie founder Frantz Yvelin.
"[We] will focus on the Paris to New York route for the foreseeable future. We are the firmest believers of the UK's 
unique market position," he said.
Load factors on the Paris to New York route - the amount of available seats filled - are "already 80 per cent plus" 
compared to the 77 per cent on the London to New York journey.
The last flight will be on 24 September. Passengers booked beyond that date will be offered a full refund.
Wizz Air and Ryanair have also stated they felt a Brexit vote impact.

TIM COOK has lashed out at the EU's decision to recover a decade's worth of back taxes from Apple, calling it 
"total political crap" and accusing Europe of anti-US sentiment.
The chief executive said Ireland is being picked on and that its government and his company have both played by 
the rules in an interview with the Irish Independent.
"They just picked a number from I don't know where. In the year that the Commission says we paid that tax figure, 
we actually paid $400m. We believe that makes us the highest taxpayer in Ireland that year," he said.
Europe's competition watchdog has ordered that Ireland reclaim (EURO)13bn in unpaid taxes from Apple after an 
investigation which concluded it had an effective tax rate of just one per cent, amounting to state aid.
"I think that Apple was targeted here. And I think that [anti-US sentiment] is one reason why we could have been 
targeted. I think it's a desire to reallocate taxes that should be paid in the US to the EU," he said.
Cook wants Ireland to appeal the decision and he is confident Apple can win, he told the newspaper. Irish ministers 
will meet again today to discuss fighting the ruling in court after failing to come to a decision earlier in the week. In a 
separate interview with the Irish state broadcaster RTE, Cook called the ruling "maddening" and "wrong headed".
Outspoken Irish entrepreneur and Ryanair founder Michael O'Leary yesterday added his voice to the list of critics of 
the decision.
"Frankly the Irish government should turn around - they shouldn't even appeal the decision - they should just write a 
letter to Europe and tell them politely to f**k off," he said.

Ryanair 'very cautious' on winter travel outlook

Europe's biggest low cost airline Ryanair is "very cautious" on its outlook for the winter as uncertainty from Brexit 
and security concerns from travellers persist, forcing the carrier to cut fares.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair had stimulated travel demand by reducing summer prices by 9% 
after Britain's June vote to leave the EU, but was not sure what would happen from October onwards, when 
Europeans take fewer holidays.
That made him "very cautious" on the airline's forecast for profit to the year ended March 2017 to climb 13% to 
between 1.38 billion euros and 1.43 billion euros.
"That's the impact of Brexit, we're cutting fares much more steeply than in the past," he told a news conference in 
London. A weaker pound risks deterring British travel to euro countries.
"If the fares in the second half of the year fall by more than 10 or 12% then we'll have to revisit full-year guidance."
Europe's second biggest low cost carrier easyJet said in July it was unable to give an earnings forecast in the 
aftermath of Brexit, while Germany's Lufthansa downgraded its profit forecast and British Airways-owner IAG 
trimmed its 2016 growth plans.
O'Leary also on Wednesday gave further details of a plan to scale back capacity growth in Britain, where his Irish 
airline is the second biggest with an 18% market share. He saw growth of 6%in the 2017-18 financial year, from 
15% in the 12 months to March.
Ryanair 'very cautious' on winter travel outlook
That growth would have been between 10 and 15% had Britain not voted for Brexit and the uncertainty that brought, 
said O'Leary, a prominent campaigner for Britain to stay in the EU bloc.
O'Leary is also worried about an EU rule which states that EU airlines like Ryanair must be 50.1% owned by EU 
shareholders. If British investors were classed as non-EU, that would put Ryanair at odds with the rules.
He urged the UK government to allow the building of three new runways at each of London's biggest airports - 
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted - schemes that arouse strong local opposition in heavily-populated southern 
England.
"It'll be a really good response to the whole post-Brexit, what's Britain's future in the world, are we open for 
business, open for trade? You can't be open for business if there's no runway capacity in the main city," he said.
Heathrow, London's biggest airport, is operating at full capacity and the government is due to make a long-delayed 
decision as to whether to build a new runway there or at no.2 airport Gatwick this autumn. Stansted, London's no.3 
airport, is Ryanair's biggest base. (Reuters)

BUDGET airline Ryanair has called on the UK government to be "radical" and approve runways at three airports in 
the south east.
The company said new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted must be approved immediately to resolve the 
ever-crippling issue of aviation capacity.
The announcement comes as the country awaits the final decision on where to expand capacity, with Heathrow, 
Gatwick and the Heathrow Hub - an extension of Heathrow's northern runway - in contention.
Stansted is the base for a number of airlines, and is the largest base for Ryanair.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said: "Ryanair calls on the new UK government to be radical in its 
decision making on new runways for London instead of picking just one."
O'Leary added that the airline was urging Theresa May to take urgent action to resolve runway capacity issues for 
the next 50 years.
He said the Prime Minister need to ensure "competition between airports delivers efficient facilities and prevents 
airlines and passengers being ripped off by gold-plated monopoly runways".
Business leaders have been pushing for a quick decision since the Davies Commission was published last July, 
which recommended building a third runway at Heathrow.

Ryanair will expand routes from UK bases in the winter. The airline, which was a staunch Remain supporter, 
warned in the wake of the Brexit vote that its 50 new aircraft due for delivery in 2017 will all be based in EU cities, 
as it predicts a Brexit-induced hit on the UK economy. Last night Ryanair said the UK route expansion, to cities 
such as Hamburg and Agadir, was not a U-turn on the plan, as routes were decided before the June vote.

Performance nutrition boost for Glanbia
Food group Glanbia reported an 11 per cent increase in its first-half earnings to €176.5 million. 
The company confirmed its forecast for earnings per share growth of eight to ten per cent this year, despite a 2.1 
per cent drop in revenue to €1.84 billion. 
In a statement, Glanbia said the strong first-half performance was driven by its performance nutrition division, with 
earnings before interest, tax and amortisation of €81.7 million at the unit, a 35 per cent increase on the same period 
a year earlier. 
“Sales of performance nutrition brands and value-added nutritional ingredients showed good growth in the first half 
of 2016, delivering on our vision to be a leading nutrition business,” managing director Siobhán Talbot said. 
The company’s ingredients division, Glanbia Nutritionals, delivered what the company said was “a satisfactory 
result in the context of ongoing challenging dairy markets” with earnings of €58 million, down by 4 per cent. 
Ryanair announces Italian expansion
Ryanair has welcomed the decision of the Italian government to reverse a €2.50 municipal tax increase and revise 
its airport guidelines, moves that have prompted it to reverse its decision to close its Pescara airport base in 
November and to accelerate its growth plans for the Italian market. 
The airline said it would allocate ten new aircraft, worth more than $1 billion, to the Italian market next year and 
launch 44 new routes, 21 of them at Rome and Milan airports and 23 at other regional airports. 
Ryanair also promised to deliver 10 per cent growth in passenger numbers to more than 35 million from the current 
32 million and to create 2,250 jobs at Italy’s airports.

Mincon eyes acquisitions
Mincon Group, the engineering company that specialises in rock drilling tools, has reported an 11 per cent increase 
in revenue for the first six months of 2016. 
The company signalled that it was eyeing a number of acquisitions – but only if the price was right. “We have been 
active in approaching potential acquisition targets, but we did not see value for the group in the terms that were 
being sought by vendors, compared with the cost of investing in our own engineering competencies to build a 
competitive offering. We consider these opportunities on a case-by-case basis,” Mincon said in a statement. 
“We continue to engage in dialogue with potential acquisitions and investments, but in some cases, the asking price 
is not supported by the earnings,” the company said. “Nevertheless, there are fine companies in the sector worth 
acquiring, and we are actively continuing to identify and engage with those that we believe would add more than 
they would cost, and which would continue to fill out our geographic footprint, and our product and service offering.” 
Board change at Malin
Life sciences group Malin Corporation has announced that Sean Murphy has stepped down as a non-executive 
director. 
According to a statement from the company, Murphy was stepping down from the board “in order to be more 
appropriately positioned to best fulfil his duties as a senior operating and strategic executive within the company”. 
Upcoming results
A number of companies last week announced details of forthcoming results announcements. 
Hotel group Dalata will publish half-yearly results on Tuesday, September 6. 
On the same day, Applegreen will announce its interim results for the same period. Meanwhile, Total Produce will 
release its interim results a week earlier on Tuesday, August 30.

Low-cost airline Ryanair said on Wednesday it had reversed a decision to cut back operations in Italy and would 
instead invest a billion dollars in the country in 2017 after the government froze plans to hike passenger departure 
taxes.
Ryanair will add 10 new aircraft to its Italian network and open 44 new routes in a move it said would lift its 
passenger traffic by 10% to 35 million next year.
"We are talking about new investments in Italy that we are making by revisiting our programmes in Greece, Poland 
and Spain," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told reporters, suggesting his firm would cut back on operations in those 
three countries.
Ryanair said the plan envisaged creating 2,250 jobs at various Italian airports.
The low-cost airline said earlier this year that it planned to shed 600 jobs in Italy after the government announced it 
would raise departure taxes to 9 euros from 6.50 euros to help subsidize layoffs at former flagship carrier Alitalia.
However, the government put the planned hike on hold last month, encouraging Ryanair to boost its Italian network.

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair (RYA.L) Tuesday announced its plan to invest $1 billion for 10 new aircraft to the 
Itlalian market. The airline company will open 44 new routes with 21 at Rome and Milan and 23 at Italy's regional

2017. In addition 2250 jobs will be created by Italy's airports. 
  The company welcomed the reversal of 2.50 euro increase in municipal tax from September 1, 2016. The new 
guidelines of the Italian government have helped Pescara airport to sign a new growth agreement with Ryanair. 
Earlier it was planning for closure of the Pescara base in November.    Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said, 'We are 
extremely grateful to Prime Minister Renzi and Transport Minister Delrio for taking these initiatives to grow Italian

negotiations with Alghero airport and hopeful of reaching an agreement on completion of their current privatisation 
project in early September. The company is planning to release 100,000 seats for sale from just 8 euros, which are

Body
Load factor for the month of July 2016 was 96%, an increase of one percentage point, compared to 95% for July 
2015. Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer, said: "July was a record month for Ryanair as our traffic

passengers in one month, with a load factor of 96%. "These record passenger figures were delivered at lower fares, 
and thanks to the continuing success of our "Always Getting Better" programme which continues to win new 
customers and new markets, despite yet more French ATC strikes and continuing post-Brexit market uncertainty. 
Our customers, and in particular families, are flying in even greater numbers this summer, thanks to Ryanair's lower 
fares that are already down 10% versus last year."

Highlight: The IAG boss Willie Walsh talks candidly about the airline’s future, Michael O’Leary, and retirement
Body
If Willie Walsh feels any great sense of personal vindication about the healthy state of Aer Lingus one year after his 
company IAG bought the former national airline, then he keeps it to himself. He recently left it to his chief financial 
officer Enrique Dupuy to deliver the assessment that Aer Lingus is now IAG’s star performer. 
“To be honest it is not often you hear Enrique say nice things about anything, and so for him to acknowledge the 
Aer Lingus performance is something special,” says Walsh. As we talk, his own assessment is business-like and 
unemotional. It was ever thus: Walsh adopted the same policy throughout his six-month courtship of Aer Lingus last 
year, a process that saw him win over the government, the markets and even the unions. 
“The company has performed well. The operational performance is strong. The customer performance is very 
strong. Aer Lingus management are doing a lot of very smart things. They have a lot of challenges. They are in 
probably the most competitive airport in the world, head to head with Ryanair. It’s an impressive performance. I’m 
very happy,” he says, finally allowing a glimpse of personal pleasure at the outcome. 
“I would say it has gone extremely well. I knew a lot about Aer Lingus from before obviously but the proposal to buy 
Aer Lingus wasn’t driven by me, it was taken by the team here. Given my background in Aer Lingus I was probably 
more. . . I wouldn’t say sceptical. . . but I was tougher on the team than I normally would be. I didn’t want it to be 
seen internally as something that Willie wanted to do and therefore we must push forward on it. It proved to be a 
very robust process as a result.” 
A year ago, the deal was controversial. There was a sustained campaign by some to stymie the bid. There were 
even parliamentary hearings and demands over routes, slots and jobs. A year on, the controversy has long been 
forgotten. The sky did not fall in. 
✽ ✽ ✽
Willie Walsh: Captain’s log, one year on...
The north Dublin-born chief executive of IAG, one of the biggest airline groups in the world, could be excused if he 
did have a private triumphant fist pump when the deal to buy Aer Lingus did finally close this time last year. 
Walsh had begun his career as an Aer Lingus pilot at 17. He took the job of chief executive in 2001 when no one 
else would, with the airline teetering on the brink of insolvency in post 9-11 shock and in desperate need of radical 
cutbacks. He quit three years later with the airline back on track with a brand new low-cost approach, but with Bertie 
Ahern’s admonishments for a failed management buyout proposal ringing in his ears. 
When he returned as boss of mighty IAG with an open cheque book in December 2014, offering to buy the 
government’s share, he was not greeted with open arms as a prodigal son. Now he can point to an airline that is 
looking to growth and expansion in a sector where many others face retrenchment. It is understandable then that he 
can’t resist a dig at those who loudly criticised his move to buy the former national flag carrier. 
“All of the doom and gloom merchants I hope are acknowledging that we have delivered what we promised, there 
hasn’t been any negatives and in fact the positives have been very significant,” he says. 
“There were a number of people who thought the world would end. I’m sure it is pleasing for everyone to see that 
hasn’t happened. Not only has it not happened but Aer Lingus has gone from strength to strength. There is still the 
exact same number of people employed in Aer Lingus today as when we acquired it. The suggestion that this was 
going to be bad for Aer Lingus and bad for Ireland, I don’t think most people believed that and we have 
demonstrated that it was not the case.” 
✽ ✽ ✽
Being chief executive of one of the biggest airline groups in the world has its perks, even if Walsh still likes to keep 
things simple. On a recent trip to Silicon Valley to launch a new British Airways service, Walsh got to spend 45 
minutes with Apple chief executive Tim Cook. 
“I had a one-on-one meeting with Tim, which was good. He was surprised to see that I still carry a Nokia phone.” 
Cook too is “very down to earth, very easy to talk to. . . friendly” and used to regularly fly in and out of Cork on Aer 
Lingus flights from London when visiting the Apple plant there, Walsh says. 
“It’s a perk of my job that I get time meeting industry leaders and spend some time talking to them about how they 
see the world. I’m always fascinated that they are interested in my views and how I see the world.” 
He has learned his trade as a chief executive by watching others, particularly their mistakes. 
“It’s not that difficult to be a leader. The difference between a manager and a leader is that as a leader you have got 
to be able to stand up and give bad news. Standing up and giving good news is something I find a lot of people are 
able to do but early on in my career as a chief executive I learned that I could not hide away in an office and expect 
others to pass on the bad news. Unfortunately in the airline industry you get plenty of opportunity to do that.” 
Being the bearer of bad news also draws plenty of abuse and conflict. In the wake of 9-11 Walsh cut more than 
2,000 jobs at Aer Lingus. After his move to the top job in British Airways he eyeballed the powerful British transport 
unions and won. When he arrived in Spain to merge Iberia with BA to create IAG he faced more hostility before 
getting his way. But, for Walsh, it’s all in a day’s work. 
“It’s not tough. If you sign up for the job, you sign up for that. If you are not prepared for that then don’t sign up. I 
went into the role of chief executive at Aer Lingus with my eyes open and I knew what I was being appointed to. No 
one could say better than me what the problem was and what the solution needed to be. Any chief executive who 
says they find it tough should have thought about that before they took on their role. If you are not prepared for that 
criticism you shouldn’t do the job.” 
Willie Walsh: Captain’s log, one year on...
For how long Walsh – a famous workaholic – is prepared to carry on doing the job is a question to which he gives 
an open response. When he joined Aer Lingus at 17, the retirement age for pilots was 55 and, he says, “you get 
that into your head”. 
“I had said when I was about 30 that I was still planning to retire when I was 55. I will be 55 in October but I will still 
be 55 until the 24th October, 2017. I’m not planning on it but I had come to terms with the fact that I will retire at 
some stage. I’ve seen a lot of people – a lot of them in Aer Lingus – coming up to retirement without thinking about 
it and then struggling with it. I love doing what I am doing and I’ve no intention of stopping at this stage but I will 
stop at some point. And when I do stop in my role at IAG my intention is to retire. I’ve been working in the industry 
since I was 17 and I came from a family where my father expected us to work during the summers so work is not an 
issue for me. 
“But I acknowledge that at some point you have to stop doing that and I am hoping to be in the fortunate position 
that I will be able to stop and maybe enjoy a few things that I haven’t been able to enjoy while I’ve been working. 
But I’m not planning on it and I have made it very clear that I am happy to continue as long as the board want me. 
The day I wake up and say ‘shit, I don’t want to do this’ is the day I’ll know it’s time for me to go.” 
Unlimited ambition
Walsh has inevitably spent much of his career looking over his shoulder at Michael O’Leary, not least because 
many of the cuts he has implemented have been aimed at helping various airlines better compete with Ryanair. 
He doesn’t get tired of being asked about his low cost rival, he says: “I openly talk about Michael. When I’m asked 
to make speeches it gives me a good 15 minutes of stuff to entertain people with.” 
O’Leary, he says, is “visionary” and “has to be admired like all leaders that are publicly able to change direction. 
That is not something that everybody is comfortable with. I don’t think he said he got it wrong but for him to be able 
to say ‘I might not have got it right’. . . and if he had known he would have changed earlier. . . I think you have to 
admire him for that.” 
He is impressed with the results of Ryanair’s recent transformation programme and sees opportunity in a possible 
passenger sharing deal that is under negotiation between Aer Lingus and Ryanair. 
“If customers want to use them to connect to us I don’t see any reason to not try and facilitate that. I have left that to 
[Aer Lingus chief executive] Stephen Kavanagh but talks are progressing. I have encouraged him to look at 
developing that relationship. We think there is an opportunity there so I remain optimistic that we will end up doing 
something with Ryanair. It’s on Stephen’s agenda, maybe not top of his agenda but he is certainly progressing it,” 
says Walsh, who is happy to leave the day to day business at Aer Lingus to Kavanagh. 
“It is no secret that I was a big fan of Stephen’s from the time I worked in the airline,” says Walsh. “He was 
instrumental in the building of the Aer Lingus strategy. He’s the brains behind the business there.” 
When IAG launched its bid in December 2014, the Aer Lingus board was in the process of recruiting a new chief 
executive and there was speculation about high profile candidates such as Qantas boss Alan Joyce and former 
Paddy Power boss Patrick Kennedy. 
“I made my views known to [then Aer Lingus chairman] Colm Barrington. While it was clearly a decision for Aer 
Lingus and the Aer Lingus board, and they clearly had to take that decision as an independent Aer Lingus, I had 
indicated to him that if Stephen wasn’t appointed he would probably leave the business and I would be top of the 
queue in offering him a job. The guy has a lot to contribute, he’s very talented, very bright. In his short term as Aer 
Lingus chief executive he has achieved quite a lot and there is a lot more for him to do.” 
Walsh intends “in due course” to step down as chairman of Aer Lingus, which he took on after the successful bid 
last year, with Kavanagh becoming executive chairman. 
Willie Walsh: Captain’s log, one year on...
“It has been a better year for Aer Lingus than expected but I wouldn’t say significantly better. But it is in line with 
what Stephen would have wanted to deliver. He is tough on himself and that is one of the things I admire about the 
guy. . . he sets very high standards and goals,” says Walsh. 
“It is still early days but we are not in any way limiting Aer Lingus’s ambition – quite the opposite. We in IAG don’t 
need to encourage them but we are encouraging them to be brave and to look at what they could do. And to be 
honest I am not limiting their ambition to just operating in Dublin or just in Ireland, but the focus should be Dublin 
because it is a hub and gives them the best opportunity. We have encouraged the team there to be aggressive in 
terms of what options might be available going forward.” 
Two new Airbus A330s due next year will provide for further transatlantic expansion but IAG is actively considering 
a possible order next year for an unspecified number of smaller Airbus A321LRs. Such an order represents “a 
potential game changer” for Aer Lingus, says Walsh, enabling the airline to boost frequencies on a number of  
transatlantic routes. 
“That would make Dublin an even more attractive hub because it would give you transatlantic options throughout 
the day making the hub work even better. That’s the way we are looking at the moment. . . although we have not 
committed to the 321LR, and there are other potential aircraft options, we think in the Aer Lingus context it is a very 
attractive proposition.” 
Any such ramping up of transatlantic traffic is dependent upon Dublin Airport becoming “an efficient, attractive, 
welcoming, pleasant hub”. 
“For Aer Lingus to fulfil the potential that we believe exists, Dublin needs to be an airport that people want to 
transfer through, not have to transfer through. There are lots of major hub airports people go to because they have 
no choice. We want people to actually look forward to transferring through Dublin because it is convenient, it’s 
friendly. . . all the things Dublin can be. But this will require full cooperation with DAA and IAA because it needs to 
be an efficient airport with smartly developed infrastructure.” 
In London, Walsh has consistently warned that a £23 billion price tag on a new runway at Heathrow, not to mention 
the political stalemate into which that project has fallen, will curtail growth. Dublin is being more pragmatic, he says, 
but like other airlines, he has concerns. 
“Infrastructure has to be efficient and has to be built with cost in mind. A runway is a simple piece of infrastructure. 
You don’t need to make it elaborate, you don’t need more runway than is required. Dublin is a good airport but it 
could be more efficient within the existing infrastructure, and the airport acknowledges that and is working to do 
that. If Dublin and the Irish economy continues to develop then a runway is definitely required, and as long as it is 
built in an efficient manner we will support it. We don’t want to see the costs for passengers at Dublin Airport 
increase.” 
Brexitunities
When Britain voted to leave the EU, IAG moved quickly to issue a profit warning. Operating profits were going to 
grow by almost £1 billion during 2016. Not so anymore, the airline told the markets. Business had already slowed 
ahead of the vote, it said, and conditions would remain difficult. The company’s share price plummeted 20 per cent. 
But Walsh remains sanguine and believes, for the most part, that IAG has taken the worst of its Brexit hit. The main 
negative from the referendum result for IAG was the sudden collapse in the value of sterling because although it 
reports its results in euro, its large British operation means that it does a lot of business in sterling. The weaker 
exchange rate means this sterling is translated at a much lower exchange rate, thus hitting euro profitability. 
“As a business we didn’t take a position on Brexit. I spoke personally that I thought Britain would be better off 
remaining in the EU and I voted to remain. But the people have spoken. We can argue whether it was the right or 
wrong decision for as long as we want, but the fact is that Britain will leave the EU. That means people are going to 
Willie Walsh: Captain’s log, one year on...
have to look at doing business in a different way. But it’s not going to stop people doing business and even the 
people who felt it would be negative have now got to start looking at the opportunities,” he says. 
Indeed, he believes Brexit is also an opportunity, particularly for Aer Lingus, because the weak pound makes Britain 
“very attractive” from a tourism and business point of view. Aer Lingus increasingly provides services from the US 
over Dublin into Britain and that is an opportunity, and weaker sterling will only encourage that traffic. 
Strong transatlantic growth has put Aer Lingus in a good place in another way too, he says. 
“Because of the amount of US business Aer Lingus now does, it has a very strong dollar revenue base, which is 
very positive for a European carrier in an industry that is typically short dollars.” 
Effectively, Aer Lingus has more dollar revenues than it has dollar costs, leaving it well placed to deal with a volatile 
currency environment. Of course, a series of terror attacks and political uncertainty in many countries means that 
the overall economic environment is also increasingly nervy – never a good thing for the aviation business, which is 
prone to cyclical downturns. But Walsh is determined to remain upbeat. 
“You have to put the noise to one side and look at what the fundamentals are like and the fundamentals are still 
okay,” he says. “Global economies are still relatively good at the moment. We are not in a 2008 or 2009 
environment. It is not a recession and we need to remember that. Growth is slow and in some cases weak and 
unsustainable, but there is growth out there. Where economies are growing that represents opportunities.” 
But, says Walsh, IAG is a pragmatic company, and while it believes demand for air transport will continue to grow, it 
has, like a lot of airlines, decided to scale back some of its plans to grow capacity. 
“That is the sensible thing to do. We are still growing because demand continues to grow but I think the industry is 
demonstrating its discipline. I remain reasonably optimistic about the outlook for 2017. I think the general economic 
environment will be better than 2016 and, yes, there are headwinds out there. But you can’t just look at those, 
you’ve got to focus on the opportunities too.” 
Regional growth
Walsh, who currently serves as both chairman of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and as 
president of the London Chamber of Commerce, is in a unique position to understand the shifting sands on both 
sides of the Irish Sea. Brexit will impact on the Irish economy, he says, but there are positives too, not least the 
possibility that for any businesses now planning to leave Britain, Ireland presents a real opportunity. 
But he is realistic too. When it comes to economics Walsh does not stray too far from philosophies that have always 
worked well for him when he faced troubled airlines. 
“Ireland has a small open economy so there are always going to be challenges. But the pace of growth was good 
this year and last year, and we have to continue to focus on that. The debt is being managed downwards and is 
ahead of target. The measures that were taken were tough and unpopular but I can’t see that there was any 
alternative. I think there is an appropriate rebalancing at the moment but that rebalancing can’t put at risk what 
recovery we have seen, and everybody wants to see that recovery expand beyond the areas that have felt it. 
“They want to see it go beyond Dublin and there is evidence that is happening, although not at a pace that 
everybody would like to see. When you travel to Dublin you can feel it. The restaurants are busy, the pubs are busy, 
the taxis are busy. Business people are more optimistic and employment opportunities continue to improve. But that 
hasn’t been felt nationally. I have a place in Tipperary and I spend a bit of time there. If I drive into Portumna there 
are still a lot of shops and pubs that are closed and haven’t felt the recovery that is in Dublin. But it is getting better 
and I hope that continues.” 
Of course, a huge airline group with an Irish subsidiary could play a big role in bringing growth to Ireland’s regions 
with new routes and expanded capacity. Is there potential for IAG and Aer Lingus to expand at Cork and Shannon? 
Willie Walsh: Captain’s log, one year on...
“Yes, there is. I’ve always been optimistic about Cork. It surprised me that Cork had seen its traffic numbers 
weaken the way it had but we’ve put capacity in there and we are putting capacity into Shannon. But we’ve got to 
be realistic. I think people who believe that you put airlines into a market when the demand doesn’t exist. . . that 
doesn’t happen. There has to be underlying demand. There has to be business demand. 
“There has to be support in the local economy. It’s not good enough that you have politicians saying that it should 
happen. That’s not going to deliver results and companies are not going to put expensive assets into markets 
unless they can see a return. And I make no apologies for that. We have to see a return on the investments that we 
make. If the support is there we will put capacity in and if it is not then we won’t. It’s as simple as that.” 
The company is putting capacity into Dublin because it sees a lot of demand there that is generated by its growing 
status as a hub for transfer traffic. 
“That leads to an improvement in connectivity and increase in schedules and frequencies that have a very 
significant positive effect on the local community. But Shannon and Cork are not hubs and won’t be,” Walsh says. 
“They serve point to point markets and there is strong demand for those markets but we will only serve them where 
the demand exists and we are not going to put more capacity than is justified by the underlying demand.” 
Walsh’s assessment is cold and logical as ever. But it’s hard to resist the feeling that when it comes to Irish matters, 
deep down there is always a hint of emotion.

Trade disputes and the industrial relations landscape

Employers that do not engage in collective bargaining may be brought before the Labour Court for the investigation 
of a trade dispute. 
The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 put in place a mechanism whereby the Labour Court can consider 
trade disputes (concerning the terms and conditions of workers), and make initial recommendations, followed by 
legally binding determinations, resulting from this consideration. 
Where a trade dispute has been referred to the Labour Court, an employer may seek to put forward an argument 
that the Labour Court has no jurisdiction to investigate the dispute. 
This typically arises in circumstances where an employer can show that, while it does not engage in collective 
bargaining with a trade union, it does so with a non-unionised excepted body of workers. 
The 2001 act was expected to have significant implications for non-unionised employers. 
However, in the 2007 case of Ryanair Ltd v the Labour Court (2007), the Supreme Court was satisfied that 
negotiations between Ryanair and staff groups which were not trade unions did amount to collective bargaining for 
the purposes of the 2001 act. 
It followed that the Labour Court did not have jurisdiction to deal with the dispute. This judgment altered the 
interpretation of the ambit of the 2001 act to such an extent that the referral of trade disputes was effectively set at 
naught for a prolonged period of time. 
Broad interpretation
Just over a year ago, on August 1, 2015, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 amended the 2001 act 
mechanism by seeking to enhance the rights of workers. 
Trade disputes and the industrial relations landscape
The introduction of new definitions of collective bargaining and excepted body created greater scope for disputes to 
be referred to the Labour Court for the first time since Ryanair. 
The broadening of the interpretation of the 2001 act mechanism was welcomed by trade unions and employee 
bodies alike. 
One year on, the Labour Court has made only one recommendation under the amended regime, in the recent case 
of Freshways Food Company and Siptu. 
The Freshways trade dispute
The dispute related to rates of pay and conditions of employment for Siptu members employed as general 
operatives in Freshways (a sandwich preparation and distribution business), which Siptu contended were less 
favourable than comparable workers in similar employment. 
Freshways does not recognise Siptu or any other trade union for the purposes of collective bargaining. However, 
the company submitted that it already engaged in collective bargaining with its staff representative group (the SRG) 
as an excepted body. 
Freshways put forward a 2.5 per cent pay rise agreed with the SRG in 2015, in an attempt to demonstrate that 
collective bargaining was taking place. 
The Labour Court examined the SRG and this argument in light of the new definitions of collective bargaining and 
excepted body. 
In determining that it did have requisite jurisdiction to investigate the dispute, the Labour Court decided that, even if 
it could be shown that the SRG negotiated with Freshways, the fact that it did so not only in respect of its own 
members, but also other employees, meant that it did not fall within the definition of an excepted body under the 
2015 act. 
The Labour Court was not satisfied that the one ad hoc example of a pay rise in 2015 demonstrated that 
“negotiation” was taking place nor did it amount to a “practice” of collective bargaining in line with the statutory 
definition. 
Recommendations by the Labour Court
In summary, the Labour Court recommended improvements to the workers’ terms and conditions to include three 
incremental pay increases by January 2018, enhanced paid sick leave and an additional day of annual leave for 
workers with more than five years’ service. 
A disciplinary and grievance procedure was also recommended, allowing for trade union representation, as was a 
mechanism for the referral of disputes to the appropriate service of the Workplace Relations Commission and/or the 
Labour Court. 
Implications for employers
The recommendation has significant implications for employers which do not engage in collective bargaining. Even 
where an employer already has a staff body with whom it engages in respect of terms and conditions of 
employment, it appears this may not be sufficient to meet the statutory definitions. 
The case is certainly indicative of the manner in which the Labour Court is likely to consider the common 
preliminary argument as to whether it has jurisdiction to investigate a dispute. 
One year on, while Freshways is the only recommendation made under the amended 2001 act regime, the stage 
has been set for more to follow.

EASYJET increased the number of passengers carried in July by nearly seven per cent compared to July 2015.
That figure put it behind growth of 12 per cent revealed by rival Ryanair this week, but load factors were 
comparable. The Luton-based airline filled 95.8 per cent of flights, an increase of 1.5 per cent on July 2015.
It carried a total of 7.5m passengers in the month but was blighted by the ongoing industrial action that has also 
impacted its rivals.
There were a total of 350 cancellations during the month and while this was comparable to 2015 - when there were 
318 cancelled - the majority of them (285 in total) were a result of fires at Rome's Fiumicino airport.
The airline's share price has lost over a third of its value since the referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.
It has previously highlighted a decline of economic and consumer confidence which created a "difficult" trading 
environment.

NOT TO be overshadowed by the feats of sporting prowess at the forthcoming Rio Olympics, Ryanair said it had 
broken the world record for the most passengers carried by an airline during one month.
"July was a record month for Ryanair as our traffic grew by 12 per cent to 11.3m customers and we became the first 
airline in the world to carry over 11m international passengers in one month, with a load factor of 96 per cent," said 
Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs.
Load factors were 96 per cent, but Liberum said it may be a high-water mark. "Load factors are reaching their upper 
limit, [and are] likely to stabilise in the coming months."

Introduction to service of the Boeing 737 Max 200 will be a “game-changer” for Ryanair, the budget airline’s finance 
chief Neil Sorahan argues.
Speaking after the carrier released its first-quarter earnings on 25 July, Sorahan highlighted the aircraft as a key 
part of a “relentless focus on cost” at Ryanair.
“In 2019, we start to take delivery of the Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft, or ‘The Game Changer’ as we’ve christened it 
at Ryanair, because we think it’s the next step up in the evolution of costs in Ryanair,” Sorahan says.
The airline has 100 of the jets on firm order, plus 100 options, Flight Fleets Analyzer shows.
Aside from a 16% improvement in fuel efficiency over Ryanair’s current fleet of 737-800s, the Max 200, a variant of 
the Max 8, will carry more passengers – 197 versus 189 – without incurring additional cabin costs, says Sorahan.
“This aircraft has 4%, or eight, more seats than the current 737. We get those seats without any additional cost in 
the cabin – we have a cabin crew member for every 50 passengers,” he notes.
Ryanair currently has 353 in-service 737-800s, Flight Fleets Analyzer indicates, with 115 outstanding firm orders for 
that variant, on top of its orders for the 737 Max.

Highlight: Airline expects to capture up to 23 per cent of the market within eight years
Body
Ryanair remains on target to carry almost a quarter of all European short haul passengers despite the challenges of 
Brexit and terrorism, according to the airline’s chief financial officer.
Ryanair expects to capture up to 23 per cent of the market within eight years, up from its current 15 per cent market 
share, said Neil Sorohan. The company’s share price was hit hard following the Brexit vote and seat sales have 
also been hit after each of the recent terrorist incidents, Sorohan acknowledged. 
“These incidents are very much a headwind for ourselves and other airlines,” he said. “We would notice in the 
immediate aftermath of any of those tragic events that bookings do tend to trail off a little bit. 
“We will typically stimulate the market with lower fares as we have always done, whether it is a volcano, Sars, foot 
and mouth or the terror events we are seeing this year.”
The airline reduced its fares overall by 10 per cent in the quarter to the end of June and is targeting a 6 per cent 
reduction in the current  quarter.
“Business still has to be done and people still want to travel, especially if you give them good value,” said Sorohan. 
“So, no, I don’t think the model is under threat. The plan is to grow to 180 million passengers by March 2024 and 
we have absolutely no plans to delay or defer any of our aircraft orders. 
“If anything, if we got an opportunity to pick up a couple more we probably would.” 
Ryanair is targeting 10 per cent growth this year to 117 million passengers, down from whopping growth of 18 per 
cent last year, although Sorohan acknowledged headwinds, not least in Britain, where it currently earns 28 per cent 
of its revenue.
Ryanair says business model can withstand recent headwinds
“Sterling volatility is the immediate issue,” he said. “However, we hear people like Mark Carney from the Bank of 
England saying there will be a recession in Britain by the end of the year.  
“All of these comments and statements will have an impact on consumer sentiment, confidence and potentially on 
growth. But this is where the strength of our model lies in that we have the lowest cost base of any airline out there. 
We can stimulate the market with our low costs and hit our targets.”
However, the Ryanair board is taking no chances and is preparing itself to take further action to bolster the airline’s 
share price if needs be. Last week, it sought, and was granted, permission from shareholders to double the number 
of its own shares it can buy back if it suffers any further market woes. 
Since February, Ryanair has spent €886 million buying its own shares, exhausting the 5 per cent of total shares 
limit agreed by shareholders last September. 
“There is currently no plan for any further buybacks, but the board recognised that we are in volatile markets at the 
moment and said that, rather than waiting until our agm in September, it would be prudent to go out and seek 
approval from shareholders for further buybacks if it’s in the best interest of the company,” said Sorohan.

Highlight: Does a recently subdued Michael O'Leary know something that we don’t?
Body
Is O’Leary looking at lower profits?
Michael O’Leary is not a man to be cautious in the choice of his words. But there didn’t seem to be much of the 
usual bombastic language out of the Ryanair boss last week when he unveiled the company’s first-quarter profits, 
which came in at a very healthy €256 million. 
The word Brexit was mentioned no fewer than six times in the company’s statement. Later, during a call with 
analysts, O’Leary was downbeat as he told them that “there is a real risk to the downside in the second half of the 
year”. What’s bugging him and his airline? 
Ryanair’s stock has been hammered, in common with that of all airlines, since the Brexit result. There was almost a 
sense that it wanted to issue a profit warning last week. Is the outlook for Europe’s biggest airline – due to carry 117 
million passengers this year – really that bad? 
There will certainly be an inevitable slowdown in the British economy in the wake of Brexit. 
The signs are there already. The immediate effect will be on the spending power of tourists who have already 
booked their holidays and find that the value of the pound has been eroded since the vote. The long-term 
implications for travel won’t be known until the shape of Brexit emerges over the next couple of years. 
If there is a hard exit that results in Britain being ejected from Europe’s ‘open skies’ deal, the immediate effect will 
probably be the end of Ryanair’s three domestic British routes – out of a total of 1,800. Ryanair’s growth from British 
airports will also surely be curtailed, although its reliance on the market has eased, as it has expanded at a 
ferocious pace since the EU opened up its borders in 2004. 
Perhaps the bigger picture from Ryanair last week was that European travel has not so much been disrupted by 
Brexit, but by other events also outside its control. 
Market Talk
The two biggest problems facing not just Ryanair, but all airlines, are the ongoing spate of horrific terrorist attacks in 
Europe and the seemingly never-ending air traffic control strikes in France. 
It’s difficult to gauge how tourists will respond to the terror attacks on Brussels Airport earlier this year and, more 
recently, the horrific scenes in France and Germany. Ryanair said its bookings were currently ahead of this time last 
year by a small margin, but will travellers eventually change their behaviour and become more careful about going 
abroad? 
And those strikes by French air traffic control are really proving costly. Not only were 1,000 flights cancelled, but the 
cost is two-fold: accommodating passengers under the EU’s 261 directive and also putting them on rescheduled 
flights where it would normally charge late-booking passengers who pay more. 
In the past, Ryanair has been a dab hand at playing down prospects and then over-delivering. This time, it seems 
different. A €1.4 billion profit in the current financial year is not too shabby, and hardly a reason for O’Leary to be 
downbeat. 
Or does the airline chief, one of the longest-serving in the business, see trouble ahead for the industry? 
Yellen peril as Fed faces rate dilemma
Janet Yellen, chair of the US Federal Reserve, has more or less been told that should Donald Trump be elected 
president in November, her services will no longer be required at the US’s central bank. 
That probably won’t come to pass, and the steadying hand she has had on the US and global economies is 
probably needed now more than ever. 
Last Wednesday, the Fed said that the near-term risks to the US economy had diminished, and that there was a 
possibility of raising interest rates at one of its three remaining meetings this year, maybe as soon as September. 
The US economy has recovered, no doubt, but can it withstand another rate rise? Last year, when Yellen first tried 
to move on rates, she was put off by a tantrum in the stock markets. 
When rates did rise in December 2015, the reaction was actually quite relaxed. That was in a pre-Brexit world. The 
outlook for the US economy might be okay, but can the same be really said for the rest of the world? 
Britain, despite last week’s decent second-quarter GDP figures, is almost certainly heading into recession. The 
eurozone is, as ever, dependent on Mario Draghi keeping quantitative easing going. Yellen has always been 
cautious about the reverberations of the Fed decisions, but it looks as though there will be a divergence between 
what the Fed does and what the rest of the world does, for the first time since 2008, when everyone moved in 
tandem. On top of all the uncertainties that the global economy faces, this is not what’s needed right now.

Highlight: Unit revenues dip but low fuel prices and Aer Lingus deal help to boost results
Body
International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, yesterday revealed a sharp fall in unit 
revenues and warned of uncertainties after the Brexit vote and operating disruption.
Passenger revenue per available seat kilometre for the first half - an important operating metric - fell 7.2 per cent 
against the first half of 2015, to EUR6.67. Non-fuel unit costs per available seat kilometre held steady at EUR5.33. 
The company said it was cutting planned capacity expansion for the second half of the year.
However, the continued effect of low fuel prices, contributions from the acquisition last August of Ireland's Aer 
Lingus and a EUR65m boost from exceptional items helped the group to record net profits up 67 per cent to 
EUR554m. Revenue rose 4.1 per cent to EUR10.8bn. The figures were in line with analysts' forecasts.
In the second quarter, operating profits before exceptional items were EUR555m, up from EUR530m for the same 
period of 2015. Without Aer Lingus, the figure would have been EUR487m.
Willie Walsh, chief executive, said that the figures represented "another strong performance" for the quarter, despite 
a negative currency impact - principally because of sterling's weakness - of EUR148m.
"Numerous external factors affected our airlines including the impact of terrorism, uncertainty around the UK's EU 
referendum and Spain's political situation and increased weakness in Latin American economies," Mr Walsh said.
IAG profits soar but Walsh foresees weaker times Airlines
IAG had already warned of a weaker than expected trading environment on June 24, hours after the result of the 
EU referendum, amid the economic uncertainty surrounding the vote. A series of other European airlines have 
detailed the effects of economic uncertainty, air traffic control strikes and terrorism since.
The UK's easyJet and Germany's Lufthansa issued gloomy updates on performance last week.
However, while Ryanair has voiced willingness to engage in a price war to fill its expanding aircraft fleet, IAG said it 
had cut back on its planned capacity expansion to reflect the market slowdown. Mr Walsh said he was "not 
concerned at all" at the prospect of losing market share to undercutting by rivals.
The company's projections for the rest of the year included a warning that it was continuing to experience a "weaker 
trading environment" in its UK point-of-sale business, accounting for about a third of total revenue.
It expected the pound's weakness to hit profits reported in euros and anticipated at least EUR80m in costs in the 
second half from air traffic disruption.

Malaysia Airlines inks $2.75B deal for 50 Boeing Max jets
Malaysia Airlines inks $2.75B deal for 50 Boeing Max jets

Dateline: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia 
Body
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Malaysia Airlines said Wednesday it has agreed to buy up to 50 Boeing Max 
planes in a deal worth $2.75 billion as part of its fleet renewal and said it hopes to relist on the stock exchange by 
2019.
The airline's new CEO, Peter Bellew, said the deal included 25 firm orders, worth $2.75 billion, and the right to 
purchase another 25 jets, with deliveries to start in 2019. Airlines usually get a discount from aircraft list prices.
It marked the first major purchase after the ailing national carrier was taken private after years of financial losses 
and further hit by two air disasters in 2014 - the disappearance of Flight 370 and the loss of another plane shot 
down over Ukraine.
The airline is undergoing a $1.56 billion overhaul that included cutting 6,000 jobs and axing unprofitable routes.
Bellew, Ryanair's former director of flight operations, took over July 1 from Christoph Mueller, a turnaround veteran 
who recently resigned abruptly due to personal reasons.
Part of the management team under Mueller, who was hired last year, Bellew said the carrier is on track to become 
profitable by 2018 and that it aims to relist on the local bourse by March 2019.
The new 737 Max jets will be a "game changer" for the airline with sharply lower costs and greater efficiency, 
cutting fuel cost as much as 15 percent, he said.
The planes will be used for routes to growth markets in China, India, Pakistan and South Korea, and their purchase 
will be financed using loans and internal funds.
Bellew said the deal will not affect the turnaround program and that it made more economic sense to buy rather 
than lease the planes.
"We will have a lot more to do in the next five quarters to make sure the airline gets back on track but we are there 
at the moment," Bellew said,

"Malaysia Airlines is now on a path to growth across the ASEAN region. This new aircraft order will set the stage for 
our continued recovery and success into the next decade," he added.
Late last week, officials of the three countries searching for the disappeared Flight 370 aircraft said the operation 
will be suspended once the current search area in the Indian Ocean has been completely scoured.

Provident Financial was the largest riser on the FTSE 100 yesterday as the non-standard lender continued its 
post-Brexit rebound.
The stock added 5.7 per cent to close at £27.48, after its first-half results showed a boost to adjusted pre-tax profits. 
The company tumbled by a quarter after the referendum, but is now within 6 per cent of its price before the vote. "In 
the financials universe, considering results and the upbeat outlook, and the relatively defensive nature . . . it 
definitely gives people that cause for optimism," said Justin Bates, an analyst at Liberum.
Virgin Money was one of the biggest risers on the FTSE 250 after it reported a rise in underlying profits before tax 
in the first half. The stock rose 8.7 per cent to close at 266p. But it is still down more than 27 per cent since the 
referendum.
"Since the vote to leave the EU we have experienced continued strong customer demand and no evidence of 
changes in customer behaviour," chief executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia said.
Barratt Developments lost 3.3 per cent to close at 405.3p, amid a broader drop in housebuilders' share prices 
following the Brexit fallout.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank cut their price target for Barratt from 667p to 575p. The bank also cut the price targets of 
several other housebuilders.
Provident rebounds from referendum low after boost to profits London
"Reflecting Brexit, with the overarching caveat of an unusually high degree of uncertainty, we have rebased 
forecasts for the housebuilders to reflect a possible moderate downside scenario," Deutsche analysts wrote. They 
added that government policy, such as the Help to Buy equity loan programme, could provide the sector with 
potential upside.
Taylor Wimpey lost 2.8 per cent to close at 144.9p. Crest Nicholson fell 1.3 per cent to close down at 401.6p.
EasyJet was a significant faller on the FTSE 100 amid further warnings of the company's exposure to Brexit risk.
The stock lost 3 per cent to close at 989.5p, and hit its lowest level in more than three years. It is now trading at 35 
per cent below its level before the June 23 vote. Goldman Sachs cut its price target from 1310p to 1280p.
A report from Fitch, the rating agency, identified EasyJet, along with Ryanair and British Airways, as the most 
exposed European airlines following the referendum.
"Slower UK economic growth, lower consumer confidence and a weaker pound are likely to result in slower growth 
in passenger traffic, while uncertainty about the UK's access to the European single aviation market adds longer-
term risks," the agency said.
ITV was another of the biggest losers on the FTSE 100 yesterday. It dropped 2.3 per cent to close at 184.8p. 
Analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux cut the broadcaster's target price from 225p to 185p.

Body
Total operating revenues for the first quarter ended June 30, 2016 were E1.69 billion, compared to E1.65 billion for 
the same quarter ended June 30, 2015. Operating profit for the first quarter ended June 30, 2016 was E306.8

ended June 30, 2016 was E286.5 million, compared to E277.8 million for the same quarter ended June 30, 2015. 
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "This modest 4% increase in Q1 profit to E256m is in line with previous guidance. 
The absence of Easter in Q1 and on-going market volatility arising from terrorist events, and repeated ATC strikes 
(particularly in France) weakened fares on close-in bookings and caused almost 1,000 flight cancellations. 
We remain committed to our load factor active/yield passive strategy which is why Q1 fares fell 10% to under E40. 
Traffic rose 11% and load factor improved 2 points to 94% as our Always Getting Better ("AGB") customer 
experience programme continues to win new customers and new markets. Ancillary sales rose to 26% of revenues 
(24% in PY Q1). Cost control remains core which is why unit costs reduced 9% (ex-fuel down 4%).

Highlight: Carrier to push ahead with expansion as it shifts focus from UK to mainland Europe
Body
Ryanair yesterday signalled its willingness to take on rivals in a price war, even as the low-cost airline warned of the 
"downside" risks from the UK's Brexit vote and laid out plans to cut back in the UK.
Neil Sorahan , chief financial officer of Europe's biggest low-cost airline by revenues, dismissed the idea that the 
group should cut back on expansion and signalled the company's willingness to keep aircraft full even at much 
lower fares.
The comments could signal trouble for rivals such as easyJet, the UK-based low-cost carrier, Germany's Lufthansa 
and International Airlines Group, which all have higher cost bases than Ryanair, which is based in Dublin. Ryanair 
projected that its average fares, which were down 10 per cent year-on-year in the April to June quarter, would fall a 
further 6 per cent in the current quarter.
Mr Sorahan was speaking as Ryanair announced post-tax profits for April to June, the first quarter of its financial 
year, in line with most analysts' expectations at EUR256m. The figure, 4 per cent up on the same quarter last year, 
reflected the effects of terrorist incidents and air traffic control disruptions during the quarter. Revenues rose 2 per 
cent to EUR1.69bn.
Ryanair warns it is ready to launch a price war Airlines: Brexit fallout
Ryanair's figures follow warnings last week from both easyJet, its UK-based low-cost rival, and from Germany's 
Lufthansa about the impact of the Brexit uncertainty, recent terrorist attacks and severe air traffic disruption on 
profitability.
Ryanair maintained its forecast for post-tax profits for the year to March 2017 to rise around 12 per cent to a range 
of EUR1.37bn to EUR1.42bn, although it warned of "significant risks to the downside".
"If you have the lowest costs and a pretty strong balance sheet, like we do, it's pretty compelling," Mr Sorahan said 
of the arguments for continuing to seek growth.
He pointed out that in 2005, the last time Ryanair significantly expanded its fleet, the company had "stimulated the 
market" with fares as low as EUR1 to bring passengers into its then-network, chiefly between secondary airports.
"Now we're in so many primary airports, we're getting loads of opportunities to grow, so it's easier to stimulate the 
market and convince people they want to travel," he said.
Ryanair's shares closed 6.3 per cent up at EUR11.59 in Dublin yesterday. The company underlined its 
determination to take market share when it announced as part of the results that it expected full-year passenger 
traffic of 117m, 10 per cent up on the last financial year. The figure is 1m higher than the last announced projection.
Michael O'Leary , chief executive, said Ryanair would open 133 new routes for the winter 2016 timetable. 
Nevertheless, he sounded far less positive about the UK, where Ryanair has its biggest single base at London 
Stansted.
Mr O'Leary predicted a "considerable period of political and economic uncertainty in both the UK and the EU" in the 
aftermath of the Brexit vote.
"This uncertainty will be damaging to economic growth and consumer confidence," he said.
The company would focus its growth efforts on other parts of Europe in light of the Brexit vote, he added.
"We will pivot our growth away from UK airports and focus more on growing at our EU airports over the next two 
years," Mr O'Leary said. "This winter we will cut capacity and frequency on many London Stansted routes, although 
no routes will close."
In the longer term, however, there might be opportunities for the airline if UK-registered competitors were no longer 
able to operate intra-EU routes or had to sell stakes in EU-based airlines, Mr O'Leary added.
EasyJet operates a significant number of flights between other EU member states. International Airlines Group, the 
parent of British Airways, owns Spain's Iberia and Vueling and Ireland's Aer Lingus.
The average fare for the quarter was EUR39.92. Unit costs fell 9 per cent including the effects of falling fuel prices 
and 4 per cent excluding fuel.
Ryanair increased the number of passengers it carried during the quarter by 11 per cent to 31.2m.
Thanks to the effect of share buybacks, earnings per share rose 12 per cent - faster than net profits - to EUR20.01.

RYANAIR has confirmed it is shifting its strategy away from the UK in a trading statement yesterday, which also 
revealed a modest boost to profits and revenue.
The company announced profits before tax for the three months to June of (EURO)286.5m (£239m), up three per 
cent on last year's (EURO)277.8m.
Meanwhile, revenue also grew to (EURO)1.7bn, up two per cent on the prior year.
Customers increased 11 per cent, going from 28m to 31.2m as average fares fell 10 per cent to (EURO)39.92 "The 
absence of Easter in quarter one and ongoing market volatility arising from terrorist events, and repeated air traffic 
control strikes weakened fares on close-in bookings and caused almost 1,000 flight cancellations," said Ryanair 
boss Michael O'Leary.

If anyone could use a holiday, it is European airline executives. Terrorist attacks at airports, strikes by continental 
air traffic controllers and the drop in the pound have all damaged the prospects for earnings. Low-cost carriers 
should do best - and Ryanair looks to be seated most comfortably.
For one, Ryanair offers the lowest average fares in Europe, while pushing down costs. In yesterday's first-quarter 
result its fares fell 8 per cent, yet its operating profit margins rose. While rival easyJet plans to add staff in the UK, 
Ryanair will reduce flights there.
In the battle of the skies, only the most profitable will stay aloft. Ryanair (and easyJet) are both expanding their 
fleets. That explains why valuations for European airlines have sunk toward four-year lows. Only Ryanair has 
managed to steadily improve its return on equity (now 34 per cent) throughout. Buckle up.

DUBLIN (AP) - Ryanair, Europe's biggest short-haul airline, plans to reduce winter services at its main London hub 
and pursue growth at other bases because of weakened British economic prospects following the country's vote to 
leave the EU.
CEO Michael O'Leary made the announcement Monday as part of Ryanair's first-quarter earnings , which 
underscored the company's unrelenting growth and profit increases.
Ryanair reported a 4 percent rise in net profit to 256 million euros ($233 million) as it carried 31.2 million 
passengers in the April-June period, 11 percent more than a year ago. That was partly achieved by charging fares 
averaging 39.92 euros ($36.35), 10 percent less than in the same period of 2015.
Shares in Ryanair were up 5.7 percent at 11.53 euros ($10.50) on the latest set of expectations-beating figures 
from the Dublin-based carrier.
O'Leary called British voters' June 23 referendum rejection of continued EU membership "a surprise and a 
disappointment" that would undermine consumer demand, including at Ryanair's biggest hub, Stansted Airport, 
northeast of London. He had campaigned for the United Kingdom to remain in the 28-nation bloc.
He said Ryanair might benefit competitively in the medium term if the U.K. does quit the EU, because this might 
force British-registered competitors such as easyJet to withdraw from intra-EU routes, while Irish-registered Ryanair 
would face potential regulatory challenges only to its internal British services. The Republic of Ireland remains firmly 
committed to EU membership.
"In the meantime, we will pivot our growth away from U.K. airports and focus more on growing at our EU airports 
over the next two years," he said.
Ryanair left unaltered its full-year forecast of a 12 percent profit gain of around 1.4 billion euros ($1.28 billion).

Budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC said it remains on track for its highest-ever profit this year despite Britain's 
vote to leave the European Union, but warned it may yet have to review guidance since Brexit had created huge 
uncertainty.
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said in an online presentation to investors on Monday that there remains a 
very real risk that profit guidance will be cut later in the year, but he "did not see the evidence to justify" a cut right 
now.
On Monday Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers reiterated a forecast made before the June 23 Brexit 
referendum that profit after tax would grow 13 percent in the year to end-March 2017 to between 1.38 billion euros 
($1.51 billion) and 1.43 billion euros.
"I don't think any other airline in Europe will be delivering or forecasting that kind of profit growth, but all of the 
clouds on the horizon suggest there are significant risks to the downside in the second half of the year," O'Leary 
said.
Rival easyJet PLC last week said it was unable to give an earnings forecast in the aftermath of Brexit, a deadly 
attack in Nice and an attempted coup in Turkey, while Germany's Lufthansa warned on profit.
O'Leary said in a statement Ryanair would offset the impact of a fall in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote by 
shifting some capacity away from Britain starting this winter.
He warned the company faced further disruption if Britain failed to secure access to Europe's Open Skies 
agreement, but that these risks would be manageable.
Ryanair stays on track for record profit, but Brexit risks linger
Ryanair flies 40 million of its 100 million-plus passengers a year to and from Britain and has its largest hub at 
London's Stansted Airport.
The carrier said a combination of Brexit, militant attacks in Europe and air traffic control strikes had hit average 
fares, which would fall by an average of 8 percent in the six months to September compared with an earlier forecast 
of a fall of up to 7 percent.
It maintained its forecast of a fall in fares of between 10 percent and 12 percent in the winter months, compared 
with a year ago, but lower fares will increase passenger numbers to 117 million from an earlier forecast of 116 
million.
Ryanair's share price hit an all-time high in January as a drive to boost customer service levels helped it to increase 
passenger numbers by more than a third in three years.
But it has fallen 20 percent since the Brexit vote amid concerns it would face a triple whammy of weaker sterling, a 
British recession and increased regulatory hurdles. (Reuters)

       VIENNA (dpa-AFX) - European stocks rose on Monday as low-cost airline Ryanair posted a slight increase in 
first-quarter net profit and William Hill said it received a 'highly preliminary' approach from 888 Holdings and Rank 
Group regarding a potential combination.  Better-than-expected German business sentiment data and a 
communique issued by the G20 ministers pledging to boost sluggish global growth also underpinned investor 
sentiment.   The IFO Institute's German business climate index came in at 108.3, down from 108.7 the previous 
month but comfortably above the expected score of 107.5.  The U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan are 
set to meet later this week amid hopes that policymakers will sound dovish enough to help limit the economic fallout 
from Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union.

       VIENNA (dpa-AFX) - The European markets ended the first session of the new trading week with mixed 
results. The markets got off to a positive start Monday following the release of the better than expected German 
business sentiment report. However, the markets pared their gains in the afternoon.   The late reversal was partly 
due to the pullback in crude oil prices. 
Weakness in metal prices also weighed on mining stocks, while financial stocks also struggled. Investors were also 
in a cautious mood ahead of this week's policy meetings for both the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve.   The 
pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index dipped 0.01 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
increased 0.03 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, lost 0.29 
percent.  The DAX of Germany climbed 0.50 percent and the CAC 40 of France rose 0.16 percent. The FTSE 100 
of the U.K. declined 0.30 percent, but the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.00 percent.  In Paris, household 
equipment manufacturer SEB soared 7.07 percent after saying it expects to achieve an organic sales growth above 
5 percent and an increase in operating result from activity above 10 percent in 2016.  LVMH increased 1.51 
percent, after it sold Donna Karan International Inc. to U.S. company G-III Apparel Group for $650 million.  L'Oreal 
gained 0.37 percent. The cosmetics company has agreed to buy IT Cosmetics, one of the fastest growing prestige 
beauty brands in the United States, for a cash purchase price of $1.2 billion.  LafargeHolcim rose 0.35 percent. The 
cement giant has signed a pact with Siam City Cement Public Company Limited for the divestment of its interest in 
Holcim Lanka for an enterprise value of $400 million.  Air France KLM fell 2.32 percent as its cabin crew unions 
prepare to begin a seven-day walkout this week.  In London, casino operator Rank Group dipped 0.51 percent and 
online gambling operator 888 Holdings gained 3.38 percent, while ailing bookmaker William Hill soared 4.85 
percent. William Hill said it received a 'highly preliminary' approach from 888 Holdings and Rank Group regarding a

Aberdeen Asset Management advanced 0.60 percent after releasing its trading update for the nine months to June

sentiment weakened in July as the 'Brexit' vote made businesses less optimistic about their future. Nonetheless, 
they assessed a slight improvement in the current situation. The business climate index fell less-than-expected to 
108.3 in July from 108.7 in June, survey results from the Munich-based Ifo economic institute showed Monday. The 
expected score was 107.5.  U.K. industrial orders declined further in July, the Industrial Trends Survey from the 
Confederation of British Industry showed Monday. The total order books balance dropped to -4 percent in July from 
-2 percent in June. The export order books declined notably to -22 percent from -14 percent in the prior month.  
British business confidence plunged to its lowest level in seven-and-a-half years, after the surprise 'Brexit' vote, 
survey results from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) showed Monday.  The quarterly CBI Industrial 
Trends survey showed that 52 percent of firms were less optimistic about the general business situation than three 
months ago, while 5 percent said they were more optimistic, giving a balance of -47.   That was the lowest figure 
since January 2009, when it was -64, the survey said. Optimism about export prospects for the year ahead also fell, 
down to -11.

       WASHINGTON (dpa-AFX) - Early indications suggest that Wall Street stocks may open Monday's session on a 
slightly positive note, even as the averages trade either at record high or near highs. Asian stocks ended on a 
lackluster note, while as stocks opened in Europe, some encouragement came from positive earnings from 
companies such as Philips and Ryanair and a German business sentiment reading. Commodities are weaker but 
the dollar is mixed. The domestic markets could react to the direction of commodity prices, some earnings news 
flow and M&A news if any. 
 As of 6:15 am ET, the Dow futures are adding 5 points and the S&P 500 futures are gaining 0.25 point while the 
Nasdaq 100 futures are moving down 2.25 points.  U.S. stocks extended the gains in the week ended July 22nd, 
rising for four straight weeks, as earnings optimism helped to overcome valuation concerns and fears concerning 
the economic uncertainty.  Housing, consumer, durable goods orders and GDP data along with the FOMC meeting 
are likely to headline the economic events of the week. The 2-day FOMC meeting that begins on Tuesday, the 
advance second quarter GDP data due on Friday, the Commerce Department's new home sales report for June 
scheduled to be released on Tuesday and the Commerce Department's durable goods orders report set to be 
released on Wednesday are among the closely focused reports/events of the week.  Traders may also sift through 
the jobless claims report, the National Association of Realtors' pending home sales index for June, the results of 
MNI's Chicago business barometer survey for July, some Fed speeches, the Conference Board's consumer 
confidence index for July, final estimate of the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for July. The 
results of some regional manufacturing surveys, the results of S&P/Case-Shiller house price survey for May and the 
results of the Treasury auctions of 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes round up the economic events of the week.  The 
Dallas Federal Reserve is scheduled to release its regional general activity index for July at 10:30 am ET. 
Economists expect the index to improve to -12 from -18.3 in June.  The Treasury is set to announce the results of 
its auction of 2-year notes at 1 pm ET.  Reports suggest that Yahoo (YHOO) may be close to announcing a deal to 
sell its core search assets to Verizon (VZ).  Liberty Interactive (LVNTA, LVNTA) announced that it has completed 
the spin-off of its subsidiary CommerceHub and accordingly Liberty and CommerceHub will trade as separate 
public companies, with the latter trading under the symbol CHUBB on July 25th, 2016 on the OTC Markets.  Crane 
(CR), EverestRe (RE), Express Scripts (ESRX), Gilead Sciences (GILD), J&J Snack Foods (JJSF), Las Vegas 
Wall Street Set To Start Data-Heavy Week On Subdued Note
Sands (LVS), Sanmina (SANM), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Waste Connections (WCN) are among the 
companies due to release their quarterly results after the close of trading.  The major Asian markets ended mixed, 
as the commodity retreat and lackluster risk sentiment weighed on the averages. The Singaporean, Japanese and 
Taiwanese markets retreated, while the rest of the major markets advanced.  The Japanese market ended 
marginally lower, as the yen selling stalled. The Nikkei 225 average ended down 6.96 points or 0.04 percent at 
16,620, dropping for the second straight session. Australia's All Ordinaries hovered in positive territory throughout 
the session, ending up 33.20 points or 0.60 percent at 5,608, its highest level since August 5th, 2015.   China's 
Shanghai Composite ended 3.01 points or 0.10 percent higher at 3,016. Staging a recovery in the final few minutes 
of trading, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed at 21,993, up 29.17 points or 0.13 percent.   On the economic 
front, final estimates released by Japan's Cabinet Office showed that a leading economic indicators index for Japan 
fell in May. The index declined to 99.7 in May from 100 in April, while the flash estimate was at 100. The coincident 
index fell to the lowest reading since August 2013 and the lagging economic indicators index also moved down 2.4 
points to 112.9.  The Ministry of Finance reported that the nation's trade surplus came in more than expected in 
June. The trade surplus came in at 692.84 billion yen in June compared to a deficit of 40.6 billion deficit in May. 
Economists expected a surplus of 474.4 billion yen. Exports fell a less than expected 7.4 percent year-over-year 
and imports slumped 18.8 percent.  European stocks rose notably, as traders digest positive corporate results and 
a German business sentiment reading, which fell less than expected.  In major corporate news, Philips reported 
better than expected earnings for the second quarter, helped by cost savings. The company also expects further 
earnings improvement in the second half of the year. Ryanair reported a modest increase in first quarter profits but 
maintained its forecast for the full year despite the Brexit and terrorist threat overhangs.   On the economic front, the 
results of a survey by IfO showed that German business sentiment weakened in July. The business climate index 
fell 0.4 points to 108.3 in July, while economists expected a worse decline to 107.5. The expectations index 
declined 0.9 points to 102.2 compared to the consensus estimate of 101.1, while the current conditions index rose 
0.7 points to 114.7.

(RTTNews) - The European markets ended the first session of the new trading week with mixed results. The 
markets got off to a positive start Monday following the release of the better than expected German business 
sentiment report. However, the markets pared their gains in the afternoon.
The late reversal was partly due to the pullback in crude oil prices. Weakness in metal prices also weighed on 
mining stocks, while financial stocks also struggled. Investors were also in a cautious mood ahead of this week's 
policy meetings for both the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index dipped 0.01 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip 
stocks increased 0.03 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, lost 
0.29 percent.
The DAX of Germany climbed 0.50 percent and the CAC 40 of France rose 0.16 percent. The FTSE 100 of the U.K. 
declined 0.30 percent, but the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.00 percent.
In Paris, household equipment manufacturer SEB soared 7.07 percent after saying it expects to achieve an organic 
sales growth above 5 percent and an increase in operating result from activity above 10 percent in 2016.
LVMH increased 1.51 percent, after it sold Donna Karan International Inc. to U.S. company G-III Apparel Group for 
$650 million.
L'Oreal gained 0.37 percent. The cosmetics company has agreed to buy IT Cosmetics, one of the fastest growing 
prestige beauty brands in the United States, for a cash purchase price of $1.2 billion.
LafargeHolcim rose 0.35 percent. The cement giant has signed a pact with Siam City Cement Public Company 
Limited for the divestment of its interest in Holcim Lanka for an enterprise value of $400 million.
Air France KLM fell 2.32 percent as its cabin crew unions prepare to begin a seven-day walkout this week.
In London, casino operator Rank Group dipped 0.51 percent and online gambling operator 888 Holdings gained 
3.38 percent, while ailing bookmaker William Hill soared 4.85 percent. William Hill said it received a "highly 
preliminary" approach from 888 Holdings and Rank Group regarding a potential combination.
Ryanair Holdings surged 6.33 percent after reiterating its fiscal 2017 profit forecast.
European Markets Finished Mixed After Early Gains Eroded
Aberdeen Asset Management advanced 0.60 percent after releasing its trading update for the nine months to June 
30.
Consumer electronics giant Philips Electronics gained 2.10 percent in Amsterdam after backing its FY16 outlook.
Julius Baer Group climbed 2.91 percent in Zurich after the private banking group reported an increase in its first-half 
profit.
Mobile telecoms gear maker Ericsson AB rallied 3.45 percent in Stockholm as its chief executive Hans Vestberg 
stepped down with immediate effect after more than six years at the helm.
Germany's business sentiment weakened in July as the 'Brexit' vote made businesses less optimistic about their 
future. Nonetheless, they assessed a slight improvement in the current situation. The business climate index fell 
less-than-expected to 108.3 in July from 108.7 in June, survey results from the Munich-based Ifo economic institute 
showed Monday. The expected score was 107.5.
U.K. industrial orders declined further in July, the Industrial Trends Survey from the Confederation of British Industry 
showed Monday. The total order books balance dropped to -4 percent in July from -2 percent in June. The export 
order books declined notably to -22 percent from -14 percent in the prior month.
British business confidence plunged to its lowest level in seven-and-a-half years, after the surprise "Brexit" vote, 
survey results from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) showed Monday.
The quarterly CBI Industrial Trends survey showed that 52 percent of firms were less optimistic about the general 
business situation than three months ago, while 5 percent said they were more optimistic, giving a balance of -47.
That was the lowest figure since January 2009, when it was -64, the survey said. Optimism about export prospects 
for the year ahead also fell, down to -11.

(RTTNews) - Early indications suggest that Wall Street stocks may open Monday's session on a slightly positive 
note, even as the averages trade either at record high or near highs. Asian stocks ended on a lackluster note, while 
as stocks opened in Europe, some encouragement came from positive earnings from companies such as Philips 
and Ryanair and a German business sentiment reading. Commodities are weaker but the dollar is mixed. The 
domestic markets could react to the direction of commodity prices, some earnings news flow and M&A news if any.
As of 6:15 am ET, the Dow futures are adding 5 points and the S&P 500 futures are gaining 0.25 point while the 
Nasdaq 100 futures are moving down 2.25 points.
U.S. stocks extended the gains in the week ended July 22nd, rising for four straight weeks, as earnings optimism 
helped to overcome valuation concerns and fears concerning the economic uncertainty.
Housing, consumer, durable goods orders and GDP data along with the FOMC meeting are likely to headline the 
economic events of the week. The 2-day FOMC meeting that begins on Tuesday, the advance second quarter GDP 
data due on Friday, the Commerce Department's new home sales report for June scheduled to be released on 
Tuesday and the Commerce Department's durable goods orders report set to be released on Wednesday are 
among the closely focused reports/events of the week.
Traders may also sift through the jobless claims report, the National Association of Realtors' pending home sales 
index for June, the results of MNI's Chicago business barometer survey for July, some Fed speeches, the 
Conference Board's consumer confidence index for July, final estimate of the University of Michigan's consumer 
sentiment index for July. The results of some regional manufacturing surveys, the results of S&P/Case-Shiller 
house price survey for May and the results of the Treasury auctions of 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes round up the 
economic events of the week.
The Dallas Federal Reserve is scheduled to release its regional general activity index for July at 10:30 am ET. 
Economists expect the index to improve to -12 from -18.3 in June.
The Treasury is set to announce the results of its auction of 2-year notes at 1 pm ET.
Reports suggest that Yahoo (YHOO) may be close to announcing a deal to sell its core search assets to Verizon 
(VZ).
Wall Street Set To Start Data-Heavy Week On Subdued Note
Liberty Interactive (LVNTA, LVNTA) announced that it has completed the spin-off of its subsidiary CommerceHub 
and accordingly Liberty and CommerceHub will trade as separate public companies, with the latter trading under 
the symbol CHUBB on July 25th, 2016 on the OTC Markets.
Crane (CR), EverestRe (RE), Express Scripts (ESRX), Gilead Sciences (GILD), J&J Snack Foods (JJSF), Las 
Vegas Sands (LVS), Sanmina (SANM), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Waste Connections (WCN) are among the 
companies due to release their quarterly results after the close of trading.
The major Asian markets ended mixed, as the commodity retreat and lackluster risk sentiment weighed on the 
averages. The Singaporean, Japanese and Taiwanese markets retreated, while the rest of the major markets 
advanced.
The Japanese market ended marginally lower, as the yen selling stalled. The Nikkei 225 average ended down 6.96 
points or 0.04 percent at 16,620, dropping for the second straight session. Australia's All Ordinaries hovered in 
positive territory throughout the session, ending up 33.20 points or 0.60 percent at 5,608, its highest level since 
August 5th, 2015.
China's Shanghai Composite ended 3.01 points or 0.10 percent higher at 3,016. Staging a recovery in the final few 
minutes of trading, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed at 21,993, up 29.17 points or 0.13 percent. On the 
economic front, final estimates released by Japan's Cabinet Office showed that a leading economic indicators index 
for Japan fell in May. The index declined to 99.7 in May from 100 in April, while the flash estimate was at 100. The 
coincident index fell to the lowest reading since August 2013 and the lagging economic indicators index also moved 
down 2.4 points to 112.9.
The Ministry of Finance reported that the nation's trade surplus came in more than expected in June. The trade 
surplus came in at 692.84 billion yen in June compared to a deficit of 40.6 billion deficit in May. Economists 
expected a surplus of 474.4 billion yen. Exports fell a less than expected 7.4 percent year-over-year and imports 
slumped 18.8 percent.
European stocks rose notably, as traders digest positive corporate results and a German business sentiment 
reading, which fell less than expected.
In major corporate news, Philips reported better than expected earnings for the second quarter, helped by cost 
savings. The company also expects further earnings improvement in the second half of the year. Ryanair reported a 
modest increase in first quarter profits but maintained its forecast for the full year despite the Brexit and terrorist 
threat overhangs. On the economic front, the results of a survey by IfO showed that German business sentiment 
weakened in July. The business climate index fell 0.4 points to 108.3 in July, while economists expected a worse 
decline to 107.5. The expectations index declined 0.9 points to 102.2 compared to the consensus estimate of 101.1, 
while the current conditions index rose 0.7 points to 114.7.

Highlight: Airline sticks to guidance, but expects bigger drop in fares
Body
Ryanair has warned that it may lower its profit forecast for the current financial year amid weakening travel demand 
stemming from Britain’s decision to exit the European Union.
The uncertainty surrounding economic growth and consumer confidence following the Brexit vote will lead to further 
fare declines in the second quarter with the company now predicting an 8 per cent drop in fares in the six months to 
the end of September, compared with an earlier forecast of a decline of 5 per cent to 7 per cent. While Ryanair 
stuck to a target for net profit for the year to the end of March 2017 to rise to between €1.38 billion and €1.43 billion, 
the company said there were risks to the forecast.
“This time I don’t see too many risks to the upside, I only see risks to the downside,” chief financial officer Neil 
Sorahan said in an interview. “We’ll stimulate the demand if we have to to get the passengers on the planes,” he 
said, adding that a one pence decline in sterling against the euro translates into a drop of €8m off the budget 
airline's after-tax profit.
Net profit in the three months ended June 30 increased 4.5 per cent to €256m, Ryanair said in a statement this 
morning. An 11 per cent jump in passengers helped offset a 10 per cent decline in ticket prices in its first financial 
quarter.

(RTTNews) - Indian shares rallied on Monday, with fairly positive global cues and sustained foreign fund inflows on 
optimism over the passage of the GST (Goods and Services Tax) Bill in Parliament's ongoing monsoon session 
underpinning investor sentiment.
The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex climbed 292.10 points or 1.05 percent to 28,095.34 while the broader CNX Nifty 
index finished up 94.45 points or 1.11 percent at 8,635.65. Banks led gainers, with Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI, 
Bank of Baroda, Federal Bank and PNB climbing 2-8 percent.
Kalyani Steels soared 20 percent on reporting a 62 percent jump in quarterly net profit. IL&FS Engineering and 
Construction Company jumped 6 percent on winning the Rs 532.67 crore Nagpur Metro Rail Project.
Automaker Maruti Suzuki India rallied 3 percent as the Japanese yen slipped on mounting speculation that the 
Bank of Japan will introduce new economic stimulus at the end of a two-policy meeting that ends July 29.
ONGC, HPCL, BPCL, Indian Oil, Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals and Chennai Petroleum rallied 2-8 percent 
after reports that the Oil Ministry is assessing potential merger of 13 state companies to create a giant corporation.
Dr Reddy's Laboratories tumbled 3 percent ahead of its June quarter results scheduled for Tuesday. Tata Steel, 
Bajaj Auto and Grasim Industries fell about 1 percent each.
Globally, Asian stocks held somewhat steady, although lower commodity prices on a firmer dollar and caution 
ahead of two key central bank meetings this week served to limit the upside across the region.
Underlying sentiment remained supported after G20 finance chiefs and central bankers pledged to use all policy 
tools to boost global economic growth.
European stocks rose in early trade as Ryanair maintained its full year profit guidance and a gauge of German 
business sentiment fell less than expected in July.

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported that its first-quarter profit to equity holders 
of parent increased year-over-year to 255.5 million euros from 245.1 million euros. Earnings per share in euro cent 
was 19.90 compared to 17.81.  Total operating revenues from continuing operations were up 2% to 1.69 billion 
euros from 1.65 billion euros, prior year. Traffic was up 11% to 31 million.  Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: 'This 
modest 4% increase in profit is in line with previous guidance. The absence of Easter in Q1 and on-going market 
volatility arising from terrorist events, and repeated ATC strikes (particularly in France) weakened fares on close-in 
bookings and caused almost 1,000 flight cancellations.'  Ryanair maintained its guidance, that full year profits will 
rise by approx. 12% to a range of 1.375 billion to 1.425 billion euros, but cautioned that post Brexit there are 
significant risks to the downside during the remainder of the year. Ryanair now believes its fiscal year traffic will 
grow by 10% to 117 million customers, up 1 million on previous guidance.

MARKETS in the UK and Europe seem to be running out of momentum recently but a influx of earning reports this 
week may go some way to liven things up. The blue-chip FTSE 100 was up 0.5 per cent at 6,730.48 points at its 
close on Friday, its fifth straight week of gains.
The latest GDP numbers from the UK, US and the Eurozone will dominate the agenda however as investors get 
their first peek at growth in the second quarter.
Tomorrow second-quarter results from BP are expected to show cash flow remains under pressure as well as fresh 
restructuring charges. Royal Dutch Shell has a trading statement due out on Thursday.
Lloyds Banking Group is expected to bolster profits when its updates the market with its half-year results on 
Thursday. Barclays posts its halfyear figures on Friday after a better-than-expected results season from its US 
counterparts, but Brexit will remain the dominant issue.
Other data to watch for comes from Ryanair this morning and British Airways owner IAG on Friday.

Highlight: QlikTech International AB has announced that Ryanair has selected QlikView and Qlik Sense, a provider 
of in memory business discovery platforms.
Body
Taking pride in offering low-cost flight options, Ryanair is continually improving its customer proposition and with 
Qlik, the Ryanair Business Intelligence team has consolidated data from across the organization to drive insights 
and make business decisions. Shane Finnegan, Senior BI Developer at Ryanair said, "Different audiences wanted 
to consume their data in different ways. We wanted a platform that would allow us to meet these differing needs. 
Qlik offered two complementary products to do just that-QlikView and Qlik Sense. QlikView can be used by staff 
who have in-depth analytical roles, such as for those who work in Finance or Marketing. Qlik Sense has then been 
overlaid on top of this so that staff in more time-sensitive departments-say in Ground Ops or Flight Ops-can get 
quick and easy-to-digest data visualizations, showing instantly what's going on, where there's an issue, quantify the 
issue, and address the issue." In the future, Ryanair hope to use Qlik to continue to improve their in-flight retail 
offering, as well as helping to optimize the supply chain by understanding the anticipated passenger mix on a given 
flight and matching this with an appropriate range of products and sufficient stock for the flight. "With Qlik, we're 
building a complete overview of what's going on across the business and it is playing a major role in the way we are 
evolving the services we offer to customers," continues Finnegan. "Ultimately, we want to find the best ways to 
make our customers happy on-board, while being able to offer them the lowest fares on the market-and Qlik gives 
us the foundation to make educated decisions which will make that notion a reality." Sean Farrington, RVP, 
Northern EMEA at Qlik said, "Ryanair is Europe's most popular airline, helping passengers travel around Europe on 
the lowest fares. We're glad Qlik is helping the airline to improve the services it can offer to its customers while 
driving efficiencies and, ultimately, continuing to offer the best deals on flights. Our technology has been designed 
to get analysis into the hands of all and it's great to hear that staff across the airline are able to interact with data in 
the way that suits them best - that's our value proposition."

Highlight: Carriers' margins knocked by waning consumer confidence, terrorism and weak sterling
Body
Distant rumblings of trouble for Europe's airlines look to be gathering into a full-blown storm after two of the region's 
biggest operators blamed worse than expected financial performances on terror attacks and increased economic 
uncertainty.
Shares in easyJet fell more than 5 per cent yesterday after the UK low-cost carrier's trading update highlighted how 
ticket prices were falling amid waning consumer confidence partly linked to the Brexit referendum .
Germany's Lufthansa late on Wednesday issued a profit warning that it blamed on repeat terror attacks in Europe 
and increased economic and political uncertainty. Its shares fell almost 6 per cent yesterday.
The disappointing performances come ahead of figures on Monday from Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier 
by revenue, which are expected to confirm the aviation industry is entering a descent after several years of steady 
climbing.
"We're at the end of the big bull run for earnings," says Robin Byde, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe.
The results reflect not only weakening passenger demand - amid expectations of slowing global economic growth - 
but also a loss of industry discipline over fleet capacity, say analysts. Ticket prices are falling partly because airlines 
are pressing ahead with plans for new aircraft and routes, even as demand grows more slowly than anticipated.
Uncertainty drags on airline profits Travel & leisure: Europe
"There's too much capacity," says Mr Byde. "Therefore you're seeing this weaker [average fare] environment."
The question is whether the industry can regain capacity discipline, and better align the introduction of new aircraft 
with growth in demand.
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Liberum, says restraint is vital if the industry is to push returns back to last year's buoyant 
levels. "It needs to regain some discipline on capacity growth," he adds.
But there is no doubt that a series of global events has also caused a serious, unanticipated tailing-off of demand.
International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways and Iberia, issued a profit warning the day after the UK's June 
23 referendum on EU membership, citing weaker than expected trading in the run-up to the poll.
Three days later, easyJet issued a profit warning for the April to June quarter because of several factors including 
air traffic control strikes.
It also highlighted the risk of an economic slowdown after Britain's vote to leave the EU.
The sharp fall in sterling's value since the UK referendum appears to be deterring many British travellers from 
heading overseas for summer holidays.
The truck attack in Nice on July 14 - France's third terror atrocity in 18 months - has also hit demand.
Last weekend's attempted coup in Turkey has created further uncertainty over another popular holiday destination.
The effect has been global. Delta Air Lines of the US announced last week it would cut transatlantic capacity to the 
UK this winter to offset the effect of Brexit uncertainty on demand.
Carolyn McCall , easyJet's chief executive, said yesterday the "economic and operating environment" had been 
"difficult" in the three months to June 30.
"More recently, currency volatility as a result of the UK's referendum decision to leave the EU as well as the recent 
events in Turkey and Nice continue to impact consumer confidence," she added.
Airlines are likely to respond to the problems by, among other things, embarking on cost-cutting.
Lufthansa said it planned to reduce underlying unit costs excluding fuel by 2 to 3 per cent in the second half of 
2016, to tackle an expected 8 to 9 per cent decline in revenues.
However, not all airlines have an incentive to rein in capacity to support ticket prices.
While it could be in the interests of higher-cost flag carriers such as Lufthansa to avoid flooding the market with 
additional aircraft, budget airlines will be more confident that falling prices work to their advantage.
EasyJet expects a year-on-year capacity increase of 6 per cent in the present quarter.
Mr Byde points out that easyJet, Ryanair and other low-cost carriers tend to shape the ticket price environment for 
the whole market.
"Both companies will see this as quite a good opportunity to revert to their good old business model of cutting prices 
and taking market share," he predicts.
Woeful results
Kenya Airways breaks own record
Kenya Airways yesterday highlighted the scale of the turnround task at the company when it broke its own record 
for the country's worst corporate results. The airline reported a net loss of Ks26.2bn ($258m) for 2015-16, up from 
Uncertainty drags on airline profits Travel & leisure: Europe
Ks25.7bn in the previous financial year, as its results were hit by a series of one-off items, including charges linked 
to a poor fuel hedging policy.
Kenya Airways is seeking to recover from a failed expansion strategy, and, in spite of the record-breaking loss, 
analysts drew encouragement from an improvement in the company's underlying performance.
The airline's operating loss narrowed from Ks16.3bn in 2014-15 to Ks4.1bn in 2015-16, and Eric Musau, an analyst 
at Standard Investment Bank, said: "From an operating perspective, I think they're really improving. They're headed 
in the right direction and I don't think they have anything major left to clear."
But shares in Kenya Airways , which has recorded four successive years of losses, fell more than 8 per cent on 
Wednesday to Ks4.35. The stock has dropped 87 per cent in the past five years. Mbuvi Ngunze , chief executive, 
acknowledged that it had been "a very tough year" but highlighted how the airline's revenue had increased 5 per 
cent in 2015-16. John Aglionby

       VIENNA (dpa-AFX) - U.K. shares fell slightly in lackluster trade on Thursday as investors waited for the 
European Central Bank's first policy meeting after the Brexit vote.   The central bank is widely expected to leave its 
monetary policy unchanged, but investors are watching for signs of future easing in the post-Brexit era. 
 The benchmark FTSE 100 was down 32 points or 0.48 percent at 6,696 in midday trading after gaining half a 
percent on Wednesday.  Sterling turned lower against the dollar after official data showed British retail sales 
declined more than expected in June. Sales volumes fell 0.9 percent from the previous month, marking the biggest 
fall so far this year.  EasyJet shares slumped nearly 7 percent. The low-cost airline reported lower quarterly revenue 
and declined to give guidance on its full-year profits due to uncertainty caused by the EU vote, the recent terror 
attack in Nice and the failed coup in Turkey.  British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group fell 
over 4 percent and Ryanair Holdings lost 4.5 percent while travel service providers TUI and Thomas cook fell over 2 
percent each.  Real estate investment trust Land Securities Group declined 2 percent after warning of subdued 
demand for commercial property.   SABMiller edged up marginally as U.S. antitrust officials approved beer giant AB 
InBev's $108 billion takeover of the London-based rival.

       VIENNA (dpa-AFX) - European stocks fell on Thursday, with travel stocks coming under heavy selling 
pressure, after Lufthansa cut its full-year profit target and EasyJet reported a fall in third-quarter revenue.   
Disappointing U.K. retail sales figures and caution ahead of the ECB meeting and President Mario Draghi's press 
conference later in the day also weighed on markets.   Sterling turned lower against the dollar after official data

German DAX, France's CAC 40 index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 were down between 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent.   
EasyJet shares slumped nearly 7 percent in London. The low-cost airline reported lower quarterly revenue and

The Bilderberg boys: O’Leary invited Noonan to secret summit

Highlight: Conference frequently attracts criticism for its secretive nature.
Body
Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary was responsible for inviting Finance Minister Michael Noonan to the 
secretive Bilderberg conference in Germany, it has emerged. 
Noonan and O’Leary both attended the annual gathering of the world’s political and business elite in Dresden last 
June. 
The conference, which was founded in 1954, is aimed at fostering dialogue between Europe and North America, 
but frequently attracts criticism for its secretive nature. There is no agenda, no minutes are taken, no report issued 
and no journalists are allowed at the event.  
O’Leary wrote to Noonan on March 24 last, saying that “for my sins I am now the Irish member of the Bilderberg 
Steering Committee which allows me to invite two guests of Irish nationality” to the meetings.  
In the letter obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, O’Leary informed Noonan that attendees are a “very 
senior list” of European and US politicians and business leaders.  
Discussions over three days are subject to Chatham House rules, a rule where information disclosed at a meeting 
can be reported but the source may not be identified.  
Attendees must be present for the entire conference, the letter said. O’Leary also informed Noonan that he was not 
allowed to bring personal or security staff or family members. In conclusion, the airline boss said: “I think you will 
find it a stimulating weekend.”  
A further invitation was issued by the Bilderberg secretariat on April 14 with a follow-up on May 6, the day the 
government was formed.  
The Bilderberg boys: O’Leary invited Noonan to secret summit
Noonan was not in a position to accept the invitation until May 12, after the formation of the Fine Gael-led minority 
government.  
The total cost of the trip to Bilderberg for Noonan and his private secretary Justin Nolan was €2,673, including 
Noonan’s €1,434 stay at the Hotel Taschenbergpalais Kempinski, where the conference was taking place.  
A spokesperson for Noonan said the minister was invited in his capacity as Minister for Finance and that it was 
normal for the department to cover the minister’s costs unless he is on personal business.  
Correspondence released under the Freedom of Information Act also showed that several members of the public 
wrote to Noonan querying in what capacity he was attending the summit.  
Some objected strenuously to his attendance. Independent TD Tommy Broughan also wrote to Noonan asking if he 
would report to the Dáil on his three days at Bilderberg.  
There was no response to the emails from Noonan’s office.  
But in response to a parliamentary question last month, the minister said that at the meeting, he set out to 
attendees the “opportunities that exist in Ireland for investors and multinational companies”.  
“A number of the business attendees represented companies which have very significant investments in Ireland that 
support thousands of Irish jobs,” he said.

Irish household expenditure across all payment types (cash, cheques and electronic payments) was up +6.1% 
year-on-year in June according to Visa's latest Irish Consumer Spending Index.
The data shows that the pace of growth slowed slightly compared to previous months (+9.2% in May and +9.6% in 
April) but was still slightly faster than the average for the series which began in September 2014.
The increase in spending was driven by a range of factors, including increased demand with travel agents and 
airlines, as well as a rise in car sales.
During June, the Irish Travel Agents Association reported that 50% of their members had experienced an increase 
in bookings for summer 2016, which helped boost the Recreation & Culture sector, with spending up +13.9% year-
on-year. Furthermore, increases in direct bookings with airlines and new car sales in June also led to the Transport 
& Communication, recording a double-digit increase (+11.0%) in expenditure. The success of Ireland's football team 
saw a number of airlinesput on extra flights during the month, with airlines like Ryanair reportingan increase in 
passenger traffic during June. The Society of the Irish Motor Industry also reporteda 12% increase in new car sales 
during the month during the same period. Spending via eCommerce was up +15.3% year-on-year in June, while 
Face-to-Face growth only rose +2.0% year-on-year, the weakest rise in spending on the high street since 
December 2014. A slowdown in expenditure was also recorded at Clothing & Footwear stores, with spending up 
just +0.3% year-on-year. This was the weakest rise in the current 20-month sequence of expansion. Ireland 
Country Manager at Visa, Philip Konopik says, "Irish consumer spending remains buoyant, with expenditure during 
the second quarter of 2016 +8.3% higher compared to the same period in 2015." He added, "While every sector 
benefited from the increase in spending, there was a marked contrast between the monitored categories with only 
two sectors recording double digit growth during the month." Source: www.businessworld.ie

Highlight: Ryanair has announced two new Aberdeen routes to Alicante and Malaga starting in February 2017, 
which will deliver 50,000 customers per annum at Aberdeen International airport.
Body
These new Aberdeen routes are ideal for leisure customers who can now enjoy the benefits of Ryanair's "Always 
Getting Better" programme, which includes new digital features, new cabin interiors, new Leisure Plus and 
improved Business Plus services, and even more low fares. In Aberdeen, Ryanair's Head of Communications, 
Robin Kiely said: "We are pleased to announce our return to Aberdeen as we launch two new routes to Alicante 
and Malaga, beginning in February and operating twice weekly, which will help deliver 50,000 annual customers at 
Aberdeen Airport. We look forward to working closely with the team at Aberdeen Airport to deliver more routes, 
traffic and growth in the future. 
"While these routes are ideal for holidaymakers, APD remains a continuing barrier to inbound tourism and the 
development of business routes in Scotland. One need only look at the example of Ireland which saw its annual 
traffic fall by 7m following the introduction of APD in 2009, only to dramatically rise following its removal in 2014. 
Ryanair has already confirmed to the Scottish Government the growth opportunities possible if APD is removed in 
its entirety. "Seats on our new Aberdeen routes to Alicante and Malaga are on sale now from just GBP30.99 for 
travel in February and March, which are available for booking until midnight Thursday (7 July). Since these amazing 
low prices will be snapped up quickly, customers should log onto www.ryanair.com and avoid missing out." 
Aberdeen International Airport Managing Director, Carol Benzie, said: "This is fantastic news from Ryanair and it 
clearly demonstrates the opportunity that exists for leisure capacity here in Aberdeen. Earlier this year we 
undertook a leisure survey in which we asked our local community which destinations they would like to see 
introduced from their local airport. Our route development team took the survey results to the recent Routes Europe 
conference in Krakow and Ryanair has responded to this data by introducing services to two of the most requested 
routes, Alicante and Malaga. The twice weekly, year-round services will commence in February 2017 and we look 
forward to welcoming Ryanair back to Aberdeen."

Highlight: Cuts to capacity and staff are transforming struggling flag carrier into a modern operator
Body
The chief executive of Aeroflot springs to life when he pulls out his iPad. On the tablet, Vitaly Saveliev can follow 
everything that is happening at the airline at any moment.
"Here's what I see at 7am, here it's updated again at 9am, it shows the accumulated data," he says, pointing to the 
multicoloured, moving charts on his screen. "We see that yesterday we did 613 flights. On the same day in 2009, 
we did 230 flights altogether. How we have grown up, right?"
In the past eight years, Mr Saveliev has transformed Russia's flag carrier from a struggling hulk into a modern 
company on a par with most European peers.
When he joined Aeroflot in April 2009,Russia was in the throes of its last economic crisis. The breakdown of Air 
Union, another Russian airline, stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers. Aeroflot was battling not to have its 
aircraft seized by creditors. The company flew 8.8m passengers a year with 15,000 staff - way above the global 
benchmark of 1,000 staff per 1m passengers.
"This year we will fly 30m passengers," says Mr Saveliev. "So we should today be a company with at least 27,000 
to 28,000 staff, but we have only about 20,000. And that is efficiency". When overhauling the company, Mr Saveliev 
looked at how US airlines had survived the crisis after the September 11 terror attacks - by sharply cutting capacity 
Aeroflot chief readies airline for take-off Interview: Vitaly Saveliev
- and he did the same. The chief executive also cut staff, first in the 2009 crisis and again in 2014, as the fall in oil 
prices and western sanctions started driving Russia into recession.
Last year, Aeroflot reported a Rbs6.5bn net loss as the Russian economy contracted by 3.7 per cent and Russians 
sharply cut overseas travel. However, things are now rebounding.
The company expects a profit this year as its passenger load factor - a measure of capacity - rose in the first 
quarter to 78.5 per cent from 76 per cent, even as Russia's overall aviation market continued to slide.
Mr Saveliev says the board is preparing to change its forecast from the Rbs3.1bn loss it expected in November.
Aeroflot has also made structural changes, using international peers such as Lufthansa, Air France and Alitalia as 
its model.
Since 2011, it has set up a holding structure and within it has established a budget airline, merged a handful of 
different subsidiaries into one called Rossiya, and moved Aeroflot itself, the group's flagship, upmarket.
Pobeda, the group's budget airline, flew 3.1m passengers last year, making it the world's fastest-growing airline, 
and is profitable.
According to Aeroflot, it operates its 12 aircraft 15 hours per 24 hours, a metric higher than UK-listed Ryanair.
Mr Saveliev expects both the budget and the premium segments to grow, while the mid-market segment will 
stagnate or shrink - something he says is a worldwide trend.
"In Europe, it's either budget or business," he says. "But in Russia, the middle class is not fully formed yet."
He wants to use Rossiya to capture the large part of the population that is not ready for flying budget but not 
affluent enough to fly premium, a market he estimates at 7m to 9m passengers a year.
"If the number of passengers in the segment Rossiya is positioned in drops, we will grow the budget airline, and will 
squeeze things a little. If that segment lives on, we will keep Rossiya."
But as a state carrier , Aeroflot does have some constraints. Mr Saveliev says the group is not expanding Pobeda 
as fast as it could due to criticism that Aeroflot might become a monopolist in the Russian market - fears he rejects 
as "seriously exaggerated".
Over the past few months, Aeroflot has hired half of the 11,000 staff of Transaero, its largest privately owned 
competitor in Russia, which went bankrupt last autumn. Aeroflot was forced to fly 1.96m Transaero passengers and 
compensate many more for cancelled flights. This task imposed by the government cost the company Rbs17bn, 
and it was compensated only by the assignment of 34 routes that previously belonged to Transaero.
Analysts say Mr Saveliev should be well placed to balance political demands with commercial ones, as his career 
has straddled government and business.
He has held senior posts at banks such as Rossiya, the lender built by members of president Vladimir Putin's inner 
circle in the 1990s, and Menatep, the bank of then oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, as well as state gas company 
Gazprom. Mr Saveliev also had a role at the ministry of economy and trade. He joined Aeroflot from AFK Sistema, 
the holding company of oligarch Vladimir Yevtushenkov, where he oversaw telecoms.
This profile has helped Mr Saveliev tackle his job at the airline with a fresh perspective, analysts say.
"Saveliev's government relations, resources and reputation ensured a high level of autonomy for Aeroflot's 
management," says Stanislav Shekshnia, an affiliate professor at Insead, the French business school.

Highlight: British citizens will soon realise that the Brexit vote was a vote for a smaller, poorer, less influential 
Britain
Body
There’s something Dickensian about the contrasting approaches of the Irish and British governments to the Brexit 
crisis. Remember Dickens’s opening line from A Tale of Two Cities, a collage of stories from London and Paris in 
the 1770s? 
“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the 
epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the 
spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.” 
I can’t stop thinking about this line since I started reading the book to my sons recently. Dickens’s book is really 
about how ordinary things change after an extraordinary event. In his case it’s the French Revolution, which 
overthrew a monarchy to establish a republic. In our case it’s the potential dissolution of the European Union and 
the weakening of one of Ireland’s largest trading partners. Somehow in its universality Dickens’s line speaks to the 
kind of large structural change we’re seeing post-Brexit. 
It was the best of times
The financial markets have been battered since June 24. The Ftse 100 index of very large multinational firms, which 
benefit from the incredibly weak sterling level, is up €30 billion. British exporters have seen huge increases in 
demand for their newly-cheap products. Some currency speculators made out like bandits, and anyone holding gold 
is feeling very smug indeed. Little Englanders and euro-sceptics are triumphant. This is their moment. 
It was the worst of times
The Ftse 250 index has lost €38 billion in value. The Eurostoxx banks index, which tracks the 30 largest banks in 
the eurozone, has lost over €110 billion. 
Brexit: The Dickensian repercussions of Britain ’s decision to leave the EU
Over half of the £25 billion Investment Association property sector has now suspended trading, with five of the 
largest British property funds suspending any redemptions. Companies importing products have been hammered 
and are issuing negative profit guidance, especially airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair. 
Employers cut almost 800,000 job ads following the result in order to compensate, somehow for austerity. Local 
authorities and city councils across Britain have to prepare to lose large percentages of their budgets, bringing in 
austerity measures for those who need government services the most. 
In England, the EU funds more than £5 billion. In Wales they’ll lose almost £2 billion, and in the North, they’ll lose 
almost £400 million. Scotland will lose over £700 million. Here, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan revised down 
his estimates of Irish GDP growth from 4.3 per cent to 3.4 per cent, and while insisting the figures for Budget 2017 
were sound, he admitted the future of the Irish economy was now more uncertain. 
Ireland’s fortunes depend on the ultimate form the Brexit takes. Whether it’s a Norway-style or a World Trade 
Organisation-style deal matters hugely to us. 
It was the age of wisdom
Bank of England governor Mark Carney earned every penny of his £800,000 salary. Carney has given three major 
briefings since the Brexit result on June 24, each one more commanding than the last. Without a functioning 
government or opposition, the governor is the de facto leader of the British response to Brexit, and even he admits 
pulling the bank’s monetary policy levers will probably not be sufficient to avoid a period of uncertainty and 
recession. 
It was the age of foolishness
Each of the main protagonists of Brexit has now walked off the pitch. Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, David 
Cameron, Nigel Farage. Each of these men has caused his own share of the problems that will afflict Britain, 
Ireland, the EU and the world for decades. Whatever their individual talents, their collective foolishness will not be 
forgotten by history. And history is what they all are. 
It was the epoch of belief
Many Irish commentators are seizing the uncertainty of Brexit as an opportunity for Ireland to increase its flow of 
inward foreign direct investment, especially if Britain gains a Norway-style in/out, free trade agreement. 
This is the positive belief that the potential costs of Brexit in trade are swamped by the potential benefits in 
increased inflows of cash. 
As I wrote last week, I’m not convinced of this case, but I’m willing to keep an open mind. Those 17 million people 
who voted to leave voted for 17 million reasons. 
It’s not for me to try to explain the reasons behind their choices, but it certainly had something to do with a deeply 
held belief in a reassertion of sovereignty. This reassertion may not take place through the Brexit negotiation phase. 
The protracted nature of these negotiations – if they are ever triggered – may give time to let the British people 
understand the benefits of being within a free trade area, while also managing somehow starting to solve the 
problems the referendum result threw up. These problems could have been solved, arguably, by less austerity and 
more capital spending in areas left behind in recent decades, but that won’t be the solution in the future as a 
diminished Britain fights to retain its transfers to its regions. 
It was the epoch of incredulity
Very few people seemed to believe the Irish government’s initial assertion on the morning after the Brexit result that 
everything was going to be grand, and that they had a plan. Yet their plan is reasonably sound, even if their 
Brexit: The Dickensian repercussions of Britain ’s decision to leave the EU
assurances on the state’s finances are highly contingent after 2017. What the Irish government can influence, it will 
influence, but the systems within official Ireland will need to adapt rapidly to whatever trade deal looks like 
emerging. 
Meanwhile, in Britain, the shock at the lack of a plan post-Brexit by the mandarins of the Treasury and the Cabinet 
Office is now subsiding, and all await the results of the Tory leadership election to see which way the plan might be 
developed. No one believes the front-runner for that contest, Theresa May, actually wants Britain to leave the EU, 
despite her campaigning on the result, and their are questions over the CV of Andrea Leadsom, the other 
challenger. 
It was the season of light, it was the season of darkness
The Labour and Conservative parties have collapsed and are fractured by the Brexit result. These two parties have 
monopolised power for 100 years in Britain. That may change now. The post-Brexit results have seen large 
increases in race and religion-related incidents in Britain. The Metropolitan Police has recorded three race hate 
crimes every hour since the referendum result was announced. 
It was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair
The hope is that Britain will negotiate a trade deal that is very similar to the one it already has. The facts are that it 
will take whatever deal a belligerent EU chooses to give it and call that a success. It may be years before we 
understand the true impact of the Brexit vote, but it is a vote for a smaller, poorer, less influential Britain. 
The discussion on soft and hard borders between the Republic and the North of Ireland, not to mention the altered 
relationship between the EU, Ireland and Britain, the failure to launch of the all-island North-South Brexit forum, are 
all causes for despair, after more than 40 years of trying to make the movement of people, goods and services and 
capital as frictionless as possible. 
There is a large contrast between the reactions of the Irish and British governments. Ireland has at least the 
outlines of a plan and is adopting a watching stance, though now everything is contingent on the form of trade deal 
Britain strikes with the EU. Britain has effectively no plan, and the four nations that make up the United Kingdom 
have differing priorities. 
For example, when it really dawns on the farmers of the North that the CAP is going bye-bye, when trucks are 
stopped on their way into Newry, and when the little Englanders’ pet passports aren’t accepted on the way to their 
Spanish holiday homes any more, the realities of the Brexit result will become apparent. 
Dickens’s opening line ends with “we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct 
to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way”. That’s about the sum of where we are with Brexit.

Highlight: In the aftermath of Brexit, is there a raft of profit warnings on the way?
Body
‘What impact does Brexit have on our business?” DCC chief executive Tommy Breen wondered aloud to this 
newspaper in November of last year. 
“We think probably relatively modest because I’d say that we don’t trade really across borders. I think where we are 
at the moment I don’t think it makes much material impact on our business.” 
So far, Breen’s prediction has been borne out for DCC. 
Josh Puddle, an analyst with Berenberg, said the company – which has risen from £65.50 on the morning of the 
referendum to a two-month high of £66.50 – had proved “very resilient [following Brexit] partly because of the 
company’s continental European earnings. Partly because the main product they’re distributing and selling – oil and 
gas – is pretty resilient”. 
For plenty of other Irish companies, the fallout from Brexit has been decidedly more mixed. Some have seen their 
share prices plummet; some have held up well. What does that mean for the looming earnings season? Are we 
likely to see a raft of profit warnings? 
Gerard Moore, head of equity research at Investec, believes that, overall, Brexit is bad for the Irish economy. “A 
slowdown in Britain will impact trade between the two countries,” which is worth €34 billion annually, making it 
Ireland’s second largest export market. 
According to Moore, there are a number of different layers of impact for Irish companies. “The stocks that have 
fallen the most are those that are exposed to the financials; British construction or construction companies exposed 
to the British economy; companies exposed to British-Irish trade; and then everyone else,” he said. 
Rocky road ahead for companies of Ireland Inc
The companies most at risk of diminished earnings, according to Moore and Investec, are stocks like Ryanair (down 
from €13.68 a share to its current price of just over €11 since Brexit), Grafton (from £7.12 on the day of the 
referendum to £4.60) and Kingspan (down from just over €25 to around €19). 
For all three companies, a slowdown in the British economy will take a chunk out of their sales, with hard-pressed 
consumers likely to fly less, while the construction industry has already begun to slow down. 
The currency volatility will also have an impact. According to Moore and Investec, the companies most likely to be 
hit by the drop in the value of sterling – one of the major symptoms of Brexit – are the likes of Origin, C&C and 
Ryanair, which all have significant exposure to Britain and report in euro. 
The more risk-averse investment environment – for as long as it will persist – will also take a toll, with a greater 
impact on banks like Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB, both of whom have seen their share prices hit quite 
badly. 
Bank of Ireland is down by nearly 40 per cent because it has more than 40 per cent of its loan book in Britain, while 
PTSB is likely to struggle in its sale of its British mortgage loan book. 
Nevertheless, Robert Eason, head of research with stockbroker Goodbody, echoed the views of many in the market 
in saying that it’s still too early to know just what earnings season will bring, since share price volatility does not 
correlate to profit drops necessarily. 
“It’s your basic 101 course in finance – markets can’t price uncertainty. That’s why it’s finding this whole episode 
difficult,” he said. “Saying that a company with a lot of British revenue, or denominated in sterling, is likely to be 
worst hit – they’re qualitative comments, but putting the quantitative behind that is the hard thing.” 
For Eason, management teams won’t have enough time or information to draw solid conclusions. “We’re still going 
to be in a political vacuum [come earnings season],” he said. “Two more months of data in their underlying 
businesses – is it enough to extrapolate going forward six months? A year? No one knows.” 
Moore agreed that it was unlikely to produce a raft of profit warnings. Several companies in Britain have already 
issued profit warnings, such as estate agent Foxtons, airline EasyJet, and Aer Lingus’s owner IAG. 
Meanwhile, several other companies have begun the process of managing shareholders’ expectations with what 
Moore described as ‘soft’ profit warnings. 
Plenty of companies “when they look at 2017 might be less bullish than they were”, he said. 
“It’s hard to accuse them of having a profit warning, because they haven’t given a profit guidance. But you could 
see consensus numbers move down for 2017.” 
Moreover, some Irish companies might well benefit from Brexit, analysts say. 
“The property companies have performed well with the belief that Ireland might attract more financial services and 
proportionally more FDI,” according to Eason. “In contrast to Hibernia – and Green has been pretty strong too – 
British Reits are down.” 
Moore pointed to “some of the food companies that should also do relatively well. Total Produce is only down 2 per 
cent [while] Kerry is only down 2 per cent”. 
While discretionary spending by consumers was likely to be hit by any British slowdown, he said, “there’s a 
difference between buying food and an extension to your house or a holiday in Spain”. 
Some will benefit from the foreign exchange swing. Companies like DCC and Grafton – the former of which has 
seen its share price rise, the latter of which has seen it plummet – both report in sterling but have significant 
exposure outside Britain, so could get a technical boost to earnings because of the exchange rate. 
Rocky road ahead for companies of Ireland Inc
Other companies are well insulated, despite being in vulnerable sectors. 
According to Christian Hjorth, an equity analyst with Numis in London, construction materials company CRH, for 
example, is one of the companies least impacted by the Brexit referendum in Britain thanks to its diversification into 
the US and EU. 
“The share price is holding up very well. CRH is now on a price-to-earnings ratio for 2017 of about 13 times. You’ve 
got others in the building material space, British focused names, smaller in size, but trading at ten times and below.” 
He agreed, though, that it was difficult to predict more broadly which companies would actually report lower 
earnings on the back of Brexit. 
“It has been a bit of a wait-and-see. It’s hard to get numbers to a particular point,” he said. 
The fallout from Brexit may even see some London-listed companies decide to take up a Dublin listing, a prospect 
that the Irish Stock Exchange could capitalise on, though the “long-term impact of the decision will be largely 
determined by the terms of the British exit”, according to a spokesperson for the Irish Stock Exchange. 
“We will work with the Irish government and other stakeholders to ensure that our competitiveness and our position 
as a gateway to Europe are protected and enhanced,” the spokesperson said. 
The spokesperson acknowledged that Brexit gave rise to “some very serious issues . . . for the British capital 
markets” and that “companies who only have British listings and no EU listings will be constrained in their ability to 
access investors in the EU”. 
Ireland then, becomes a favourable listing venue in the event that the City of London and the Ftse become 
estranged from the EU’s financial markets. 
“The Irish Stock Exchange already facilitates dual listings with London as many companies want both a euro and a 
sterling quote to enable better distribution, so we will be able to assist companies requiring access to the EU, while 
maintaining their London listing, should the need arise.” 
However, with the British government in disarray and Article 50 yet to be triggered to begin a formal withdrawal from 
the EU, Eason said: “No one knows what the outcome will be – that’s the problem we’re facing. 
“There’s a political element to all of this. Britain has decided to get rid of all its leaders, and that puts us in a 
vacuum.”

Strike chaos sees 1,000 Irish flights cancelled
Strike chaos sees 1,000 Irish flights cancelled

Highlight: Aer Lingus and Ryanair hit as air traffic controller stoppages in France affect 200 flights this month
Body
More than 1,000 Irish airline flights have been cancelled so far this year because of ongoing air traffic control strikes 
across Europe. 
Aer Lingus and Ryanair have been badly hit because of strike action that disrupted crucial European airspace on 
average every 13 days. 
The latest stoppages by French air traffic controllers last week – the 13th this year – saw a further 200 flights 
cancelled during the busiest month of the year for airlines. 
Since March, strikes in Greece, Italy, Belgium and France have caused over 3,500 cancellations by major 
European airlines, with nearly a third of these cancellations hitting the two major Irish airlines. 
Airlines for Europe (A4E), which represents 11 major airline groups, including Ryanair and Aer Lingus owner IAG, 
published a PwC study that found ATC strikes between 2010 and 2015 resulted in 30,000 cancellations across 
Europe and reduced EU gross domestic product by up to €9.5 billion. “One of the things this study looked at is the 
impact not just on airlines but on other sectors, particularly tourism,” Thomas Reynaert, managing director of A4E, 
told this newspaper. 
“Because of the importance the airline industry plays for connectivity to a city like Dublin, there is an automatic 
impact on the economy. If you decrease mobility, as these strikes do, business meetings have to be cancelled and 
tourists don’t get to their destination.” 
Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary told a recent A4E conference in Brussels that the difficulties for holidaymakers from 
cancelled flights have been exacerbated because flights to popular destinations in the Mediterranean have very 
high load factors this summer. 
This has meant passengers often cannot be accommodated on alternative flights, said O’Leary. 
Strike chaos sees 1,000 Irish flights cancelled
Passengers often have to buy a brand new ticket at a totally different price or must cancel their plans altogether, 
according to Reynaert. 
“So Irish holiday makers’ vacations are spoiled, the southern European tourism staff who are waiting for them to 
arrive at hotels and resorts lose out as well and a lot of tourism business is destroyed,” he said. 
European carriers have long lobbied for the so-called single European sky that would see air traffic control functions 
taken out of the hands of national operators in favour of a transnational system and which would be less prone to 
this type of disruption. 
But Ireland and Britain are two of the few countries to have made significant progress on this. 
“Fragmentation is never good and we would like to see a better functioning single market,” said Reynaert. 
“That is why we are encouraging the European Commission and the member states to continue to implement the 
single European sky. 
“But it would be wrong to comment at this time what the impact of a Brexit might be on that long-term project.”

       Koblenz, GERMANY (dpa-AFX) - Raids have been carried out on the rooms of Ryanair pilots at six German 
airports as part of a tax and social insurance investigation, a senior public prosecutor confirmed to dpa on 
Wednesday.  The Irish budget airline's partner companies are suspected of indulging in fraud relating to tax and 
social insurance payments, said Hans Peter Gandner, senior prosecutor for the city of Koblenz.  Several dozen 
officers carried out the raids on Tuesday at Berlin's Schoenefeld airport, as well as at the airports in Cologne, 
Weeze in North Rhine-Westphalia, Frankfurt-Hahn, Bremen and Baden-Baden.  The raids resulted from an 
investigation dating back years into two British temporary employment agencies that supply pilots to Ryanair.

EasyJet weighs up flight abroad for HQ Airlines

Highlight: Carrier considers setting up continental legal base amid Brexit uncertainty
Body
Budget airline easyJet is drawing up plans to move its headquarters to continental Europe following Britain's vote to 
leave the EU .
The possible relocation is aimed at safeguarding its status as Europe's second-largest budget carrier by revenue, 
amid uncertainty over the UK's trade relations with the bloc after withdrawal.
No final decision has yet been taken, and any move would see easyJet set up a legal base rather than transfer its 
core functions overseas. The company's determination is likely to hinge on the government's ability to negotiate a 
post-Brexit settlement that is favourable to the airline industry.
Like its bigger rival Ryanair, easyJet capitalised on the creation of a single EU aviation market in the 1990s that 
allows airlines to operate services on any route within the bloc.
But Britain's exit from the EU has cast doubt over whether UK-based carriers will remain part of this arrangement, 
and throws up complications for overseas airlines that fly into British airports.
Underlining investor concerns, stocks in the sector took a hammering after the referendum. This week easyJet's 
shares dropped by nearly a fifth after it warned that profits would be hit by Brexit.
EasyJet weighs up flight abroad for HQ Airlines
Following a report on Sky News yesterday, the FTSE 100 group said it had no plans to move from Luton, where it 
was founded more than 20 years ago and continues to have its headquarters with about 1,000 employees.
The company said: "EasyJet is lobbying the UK government and the EU to ensure the continuation of a fully liberal 
and deregulated aviation market within the UK and Europe. This would mean that easyJet and all European airlines 
can continue to operate as they do today."
But it confirmed it had begun a formal process to acquire an air operating certificate in a continental European 
country which could allow it to set up headquarters there and continue flying throughout the EU without restrictions, 
should trade barriers emerge.
One person close to the company said this "contingency" plan would involve the creation of a legal entity requiring 
no more than a "handful" of employees.
A change in corporate structure would probably see the UK operation become a subsidiary of the new European 
company. The process to acquire an air operating certificate would take "months, not years", the person added.
John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting, said: "Having a business registration in one country and fulfilling some 
or all of your functions elsewhere is being done already [in Europe], so I don't see that this is beyond the bounds of 
possibility."
He pointed to IAG, the owner of British Airways, which is registered in Spain. "But many of their commercial 
functions are spread out geographically according to operating airline [and] country. Its centre is actually in the UK 
at Heathrow," Mr Strickland said.
EasyJet held meetings this week with EU officials in Brussels and the UK's transport department. Chief executive 
Dame Carolyn McCall has said easyJet remained "confident" in the strength of its business model after the Brexit 
vote.
"Until the outcome of the UK/EU negotiations are clearer easyJet does not need to make any other structural or 
operational changes," the group said.

Body
The Irish Independent has today reported that Ryanair will consider taking advantage of any persistent weakness in 
its share price following last week's Brexit vote to buy back more of its own shares.
Shares in the airline were hammered by the Brexit vote and a profit warning issued by Easyjet following the 
decision by the UK to leave the European Union.
Ryanair's shares were trading at E11.30 yesterday compared to E13.68 before the referendum result. Following the 
share buyback in the past week, the carrier has now completed an E885m share buyback programme, buying just 
over 65m shares at an average price of just under E13.48 each.
But the airline has now reached the 5pc buyback limit secured under a resolution at its annual general meeting last 
year. It said it will hold an extraordinary general meeting later this month to seek shareholder approval to engage in 
further buybacks. According to the report, Ryanair Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary claimed the airline's board 
authorised the repurchase of E150m worth of its own shares at an average price of just under E11.85 in the 
immediate aftermath of the UK Brexit vote last week. "It is sensible to request approval from shareholders to allow 
the board consider further share buybacks over the next 15 months should they deem it in the best interests of 
shareholders to do so," said Mr O'Leary. He added that the airline does not intend to engage in a formal buyback 
programme this year, however. Source: www.businessworld.ie

This year Ireland commemorated the centenary of the Easter Rising - the rebellion that set it on the path to 
independence from Britain. For the country's investors, a more recent "independence day" has been a rather less 
happy occasion.
Between the close of trading on June 23 - the day of the UK's referendum on EU membership - and the close on 
June 29, the ISEQ Overall share index dropped more than 12 per cent. That is worse than any other major 
European stock benchmark and more, in local currency, than even the UK-centric FTSE 250. In euro terms, the 
FTSE 250 fell by more than the ISEQ, although not much more.
Aside from the UK itself, Ireland has the most to lose from Brexit. The Economic and Social Research Institute has 
estimated that each percentage point reduction in UK GDP knocks 0.3 points off Ireland's.
But the links are not as strong as they were. Some 15 per cent of Ireland's exports go to the UK, whereas it used to 
be half. And Ireland's economy has been powering ahead: it expanded more than 6 per cent last year.
Also, what applies to the broader economy does not always apply to the stock market. Esri found that the impact of 
Brexit would be more acute for smaller companies. Ireland's largest listed groups - the top five account for almost 
three-quarters of the stock market's capitalisation - are more international. Sterling revenues vary: 28 per cent of 
the total at food group Kerry, about the same at Ryanair. At building materials group CRH, the Americas account for 
The Short View
twice as much profit as Europe. Many of the sterling-dominated companies, like Paddy Power and Grafton, have 
moved their primary listings to London.
What, then, might explain the index fall? Ireland's stock market is small: the FTSE 250's capitalisation is almost five 
times that of the ISEQ Overall. That could have exacerbated the decline. In times of stress, investors sell the stocks 
they can, not necessarily those they should.
The Easter Rising ended in defeat, yet within a decade Ireland achieved independence. Now, Brits are queueing for 
Irish passports . Brexit could be nasty for some Irish companies, but the latest steep declines seem to be pricing in 
an awful lot of bad news. Things should get better.

Body
GERMAN carrier Lufthansa and its main cabin crew union yesterday reached a deal in a long-running dispute over 
pay, conditions and pensions, a boost for the airline which is also negotiating with pilots.
The deal was achieved thanks to a mediator, who will formally announce the terms on Tuesday once a few final 
details have been agreed, the two sides said. Until then, both sides said they had agreed to keep the terms 
confidential.
Lufthansa is trying to cut costs to better compete with low-cost rivals within Europe, such as Ryanair and EasyJet, 
and also with leaner rivals such as Emirates and Turkish Airlines, on long-haul routes.
Lufthansa management and the cabin crew union UFO have been at loggerheads since September 2013, when 
Lufthansa said it wanted to cancel a decades-old early retirement scheme.
The row culminated in November, when UFO staged the longest-ever strike in the German carrier's history. A 
dispute with its pilots stretches back four years but the union and Lufthansa said last month they hope to reach a 
deal by the end of July.

Body
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Malaysia Airlines' chief operating officer has been named its new CEO, state 
investment agency Khazanah Nasional said Thursday.
Khazanah, the airline's key shareholder, said in a statement that Peter Bellew's appointment will ensure "continuity 
and further progress" in the airline's restructuring.
Bellew, a former Ryanair executive, will replace Christoph Mueller, who has resigned due to "changing personal 
circumstances." Mueller will be on leave and formally step down in September, far ahead of the end of his three-
year contract.
"Proud day. Just been appointed CEO of Malaysia Airlines. We will fix it," Bellew tweeted.
The national airline suffered years of financial losses before two disasters in 2014 - the disappearance of Flight 370 
and the loss of another plane shot down over Ukraine. The airline was taken private by Khazanah, and Mueller, a 
turnaround veteran, was hired last year to oversee a $1.56 billion overhaul that included cutting 6,000 jobs and 
axing unprofitable routes.
Bellew, Ryanair's former director of flight operations, was part of the new management team.
In an interview with The Associated Press in April, Mueller described the airline as a "ship that has many leaks" but 
said things were back on the right track. He said the carrier recorded a profit in February, its first positive monthly 
result in years, and is on track to return to the black by 2018.

BUDGET airline Ryanair has warned that it may shift its focus away from the UK and on to the EU after the 
referendum yielded a Brexit victory last week.
Just days after the UK voted to leave the EU, Ryanair's chief executive cast doubt on whether the company would 
place any of its new aircraft in the UK next year.
"We are taking another 50 aircraft next year. Would we place any of those in the UK? It is highly unlikely," Michael 
O'Leary told the Wall Street Journal. "We will pivot all of our growth into the EU."
Airlines have been among those hardest hit on the FTSE exchanges following Thursday's vote.

Ryanair is very unlikely to deploy new planes on United Kingdom routes next year and will focus on the European 
Union instead after Britain voted to leave the bloc, the Irish airline said on Monday.
The Irish low-cost airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, flies 40 million of its 100 million-plus passengers 
a year to and from the United Kingdom and has its largest hub at London's Stansted Airport.
Its shares have fallen over 23%since the United Kingdom voted on Thursday to leave the European Union.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, one of the most vocal business leaders campaigning in favour of continued EU 
membership, had repeatedly warned he would cut investment in Britain if it voted to leave. "It's unlikely we will base 
any additional aircraft in the UK in 2017 as they will be allocated to European Union airports instead," a Ryanair 
spokeswoman said in an emailed reply to questions. Earlier on Monday O'Leary told the Wall Street Journal the 
airline planned to "pivot all of our growth into the European Union," but that the airline's overall growth targets 
remained unchanged. The Irish-registered airline said it may consider setting up a UK operating licence if Britain 
fails to secure full access to European Union's Open Skies air traffic system. Ryanair expects passenger volumes 
from the United Kingdom will grow relative to last year, but that fares would be lower, the spokeswoman said. 
However, weakness in sterling, whose value has fallen from 1.31 euros to 1.20 since Britain's vote, is likely to have 
a negative impact on Ryanair's earnings, which are reported in euros. (Reuters) Source: www.businessworld.ie

AirAsia Group chief executive looks to Ryanair for inspiration, but acknowledges ownership rules present 
formidable hurdle
Given the chance, AirAsia would combine all of its overseas affiliates with its main Malaysian operation, as a step 
toward “complete domination” of the Southeast Asian low-cost market. Group chief executive Tony Fernandes says 
that if national shareholding regulations were relaxed, AirAsia would “happily invest fully to take complete ownership 
of all” its units.
For the time being, though, AirAsia must settle with up to 49% stakes in its overseas affiliates, owing to the foreign 
ownership caps affecting airlines.
The company has built an impressive list of affiliates over the years – although not all are entirely successful. It 
holds a respective 49% of AirAsia India, AirAsia Japan and Indonesia AirAsia, 45% of Thai AirAsia and 40% of 
Philippines AirAsia. Of these, Thai AirAsia has enjoyed good profitability, while the others have seen mixed 
fortunes.
“Maybe we made the mistake of under-investing in some countries such as Indonesia, which becomes a problem. I 
want to invest, but some of our shareholders aren’t fully keen,” laments Fernandes. “We can become like the 
Ryanair of Asia as a consolidated group. It would be so profitable because of our huge network, connectivity and 
brand.
“Imagine that machine – if my Philippines and Indonesia [units] are profitable,” he adds, referring to their respective 
operating losses in the first quarter of 2016. AirAsia Philippines recorded an operating loss of Ps306 million ($6.5 
million), compared with one of Ps679 million for the same period a year earlier. Indonesia AirAsia’s figures show an 
operating loss of Rp82.7 billion ($6 million) for the quarter: a marked improvement on the Rp389 billion loss the 
year before.
floodgates
Bullish Fernandes plans to dominate low-cost segment
Fernandes describes his company’s smallest affiliate – AirAsia India – as an “unmitigated success... opening the 
floodgates” for its Malaysian and Thai units to begin tapping the Indian market. This is despite delays to its launch, 
which finally occurred in May 2014, and the short tenure of the carrier’s first chief executive, Mittu Chandilya, who 
left after less than a year at the helm.
Fernandes declines to talk about Chandilya’s departure, and acknowledges that the Indian operation has been a 
slow-starter. Still, the group plans to grow its India-based fleet to 20 aircraft, from the current six.
“AirAsia India is moving along nicely. Aviation is a gestation project. It’s not something you can just go in there 
today and make millions of dollars tomorrow,” he says.
Fernandes does not give a date for AirAsia Japan’s launch, but says it is working towards that milestone. The start-
up received its air operator’s certificate in October 2015, at which point early 2016 was being targeted for the 
beginning of operations. AirAsia Japan will operate from a base at Ch bu Centrair airport near Nagoya, and fly 
initially to Sapporo, Sendai and Taipei Taoyuan in Taiwan.
Despite having his hands full with the core Malaysian business and five overseas units, Fernandes admits he is not 
satisfied with the status quo. “The world waits for nobody. It’s a dichotomy – do you throw away a great opportunity, 
or try and keep [the joint-venture] small? I hope to be in Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar and I believe AirAsia 
Singapore could be a reality soon. The Singapore government is now much more proactive in discussions with us.”
low value
Fernandes is flatly dismissive of the recently formed Value Alliance, which sees Cebu Pacific, Jeju Air, Nok Air, 
NokScoot, Scoot, Tigerair, Tigerair Australia and Vanilla Air team up in what is essentially a sprawling interline 
partnership.
“It is a Mickey Mouse alliance,” he says. “What a joke. It’s simply desperation on their part. What passenger will 
take six airlines to go from one place to another? If ownership regulations were to change, it might be better for all 
of them to own equity in each other and create one brand. That would be something worth looking at. I value 
innovation and people creating ideas, but Value Alliance will struggle.”
Fernandes remains optimistic about the ASEAN Open Skies agreement, which was fully ratified by member 
countries Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and 
Vietnam in May.
Indonesia and Laos were the last two countries to agree the pact, which means that any airline in the region can 
launch as many international flights as the market can support. This plays to one of AirAsia’s strengths: its large 
fleet size.
Fernandes believes that although obstacles remain, the agreement is key to liberalising the market. He says: “It’s 
great all countries have signed, but it doesn’t solve everything – airports can say ‘I have no slots left’, leaving you 
back at square one. But I’m bullish that when ASEAN is fully liberalised, fifth freedoms, sixth freedoms will come in.”
However, he is not concerned that the pact may mean more competition. “If the competition is better than us, and 
we get our arse kicked, we deserve to get our arse kicked. You can’t hold competition back – it makes us smarter 
and better.”
Since the start of the 2015 financial year, the AirAsia Group held back capacity and growth to conserve cash.
When weakness in the Malaysian Ringgit and concerns about the company’s accounting methods hit AirAsia stock 
hard in 2015, Fernandes and partner Kamarudin Meranun boosted their combined stake from 18.9% to 32.4%; 
raising MYR1 billion ($247 million) for the firm.
“We showed commitment, because we think the company was undervalued – and it still is,” he explains.
Bullish Fernandes plans to dominate low-cost segment
Both Fernandes and Kamarudin have become “100% more involved” in the day-to-day running of operations, and 
he says the company has paid off around $400-500 million of debt since the additional stake purchase.
By 2017, AirAsia will look to expand toward China and India as areas of growth, due to the large potential of the 
countries. In another recent interview, Fernandes disclosed that the group’s flights in and out of China contributed 
19% of its total revenue, while India represented 3%.
“I’m happy if I can maintain that same level for China. But India is really where the action is,” he says. “There is tons 
of potential and space to grow. The sky is the limit there. If the Indian government and private airports give us more 
landing rights, it will be good for business for them too.”
Flightglobal’s Fleets Analyzer database shows that overall the AirAsia Group operates 167 Airbus A320ceos, with 
303 A320neos set for delivery until 2028.
The group expects to receive its first three Neos by the end of this year, with 16 scheduled to arrive in 2017 and 32 
during 2018.
Asked whether AirAsia might have over-ordered, Fernandes quips: “We need those aircraft, and are looking to 
order more. We are in talks with Airbus now, so keep a look-out. If I can have 1,000 aircraft, I’ll gladly take them.”
Fernandes has become “100% more involved”

BUDGET airline Ryanair is urging the EU to take action after the latest airline strike orchestrated by French air 
traffic control unions.
It comes as the low-cost carrier was forced to cancel 166 flights to, from and over France today. It said that 30,000 
Ryanair customers will have had their flights cancelled, while more than 100,000 others will suffer severe delays.
It wants the European Commission to require French ATC unions to engage in binding arbitration rather than 
strikes, while allowing Europe's other ATCs to operate overflights over France and protect flights over France amid 
the strikes.
Kenny Jacobs, chief marketing officer at Ryanair, said: "It is time for action by the European Commission following 
this latest French ATC strike aimed at disrupting as many travel plans as possible."
He continued: "The frequency of these strikes, right in the middle of holiday season only serves to underline how 
urgent action is required to help reduce the impact of these strikes.
"After last week's Brexit vote in the UK, the EU Commission must begin to deliver real benefits for consumers, and 
urgent action to ameliorate the effects of these repeated French ATC strikes and prevent them disrupting the travel 
plans of millions of citizens."

If you can use some exotic booze . . . let's fly away, sang Frank Sinatra. Airline executives could use a bucket of 
pina coladas and a one-way ticket. Their profits are highly cyclical. Travel is largely discretionary, and the industry's 
fixed costs are high. Unsurprisingly, they took the result of the UK's referendum badly.
IAG shed a fifth of its market capitalisation when it issued a profit warning to coincide with the referendum result . 
The owner of British Airways and Iberia - which relies largely on business travellers - reported subdued demand in 
the run-up to the vote.
Ryanair and easyJet are more exposed to the leisure market. Seats were already being discounted to fill planes. As 
a weaker pound makes travel dearer for Brits, bigger discounts may be needed. That will hurt margins.
Soft sterling might create downward pressure in other ways, too. BA, which accounts for the majority of IAG's 
operating profit, earns mostly in pounds, reports in euros and buys its fuel in dollars. Fuel and currency exposures 
will be hedged in the short term. The long-term impact is unclear.
Britain's participation in the Open Skies agreement - which allows airlines to operate from any EU airport - is 
expected to be part of Brexit negotiations. If they do not get the access they want, airlines such as easyJet are likely 
to relocate their UK bases to the continent.
The MSCI Europe Airline index had risen by nearly half in three years, comfortably beating the FTSE Eurofirst 300. 
Airlines leveraged economic growth, cheap financing and lower oil prices to expand capacity. Investors were 
already fretting about the consequences , in Europe and the US. They will fret more now. One consolation: 
Airlines: brace position
uncertainty reinforces the need for reform at legacy carriers. Both Air France-KLM and Lufthansa remain embroiled 
in damaging industrial relations disputes. Darkening skies may force co-operation.

Body
Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary is to speak at a Fine Gael fundraiser in Dublin later this year. 
The outspoken airline boss has been invited to address the party’s Dublin Bay South €55-a-plate business 
breakfast at the Shelbourne Hotel on October 5. 
The annual event is one of Fine Gael’s main fundraisers with the money going towards the local constituency 
organisation. It is usually attended by ministers, TDs, members and business people. 
Taoiseach Enda Kenny was last year’s guest speaker while the event was addressed by British ambassador 
Dominic Chilcott in 2014. O’Leary has often been critical of the Irish political system. In April, he criticised 
independent TDs and said that Ireland needed to be more sensible than electing “the local favourite or the local 
lunatic”. 
“We need to, whenever the next election comes around, vote in parties who are capable of running the country for a 
four or five year period,” he told RTÉ. 
Although he has not stated his political allegiances publicly, O’Leary has been critical of Sinn Féin and other left-
wing parties, saying he would emigrate if a wealth tax was introduced and describing it as “populist nonsense and 
rubbish”.

Northern Ireland's deputy leader Martin McGuinness called for a vote to unite the two sides of the Irish border on 
Friday, as stocks tumbled and the damaging economic and political fallout from Britain's decision to quit the EU 
were immediately felt.
Ireland has the EU's fastest-growing economy but also more to lose than any other member state from Brexit with 
far-reaching implications for its trade, economy, security of energy supplies and peace in British-ruled Northern 
Ireland.
After 56% of Northern Irish voters sought to remain in the EU compared to the 52%of the United Kingdom as a 
whole who voted leave, Sinn Fein's McGuinness said it was imperative that London called a referendum on a united 
Ireland.
"The British government now has no democratic mandate to represent the views of the North in any future 
negotiations with the European Union and I do believe that there is a democratic imperative for a 'border poll' to be 
held," McGuinness told RTE. "The implications for all of us on the island of Ireland are absolutely massive. This 
could have very profound implications for our economy (in Northern Ireland)." The call from Sinn Fein, Northern 
Ireland's largest Irish nationalist party, was later rebuffed by First Minister Arlene Foster. Taoiseach Enda Kenny, 
who has said his government had a full-scale contingency plan in place should its nearest neighbor and largest 
trade partner vote to leave, called an emergency cabinet meeting shortly after the result. The outcome has very 
significant implications for Ireland and the EU as a whole, a government statement said. Ireland's central bank had 
warned that a withdrawal would hurt economic growth and jobs and significantly impact the financial sector, while a 
government-commissioned report found it could cut trade with Britain by at least 20%. Irish banks, whose exposure 
to the UK accounts for around 21 percent of total assets, led the Irish stock market nine percent lower, with shares

in Bank of Ireland and permanent tsb down 21% and 17% down by 0845 GMT. Europe's largest airline by 
passenger numbers Ryanair , building materials group Kingspan and packaging producer Smurfit Kappa also fell 
sharply. The local bourse was down by as much as 16% earlier on Friday. The yield on Ireland's benchmark 10-
year bonds was marginally higher at a near record low 0.78%. Finance Minister Michael Noonan said earlier this 
week that an estimated cumulative Brexit-related hit on the Irish economy of as much as 1.6%of GDP would be 
"containable." As the UK voted on Thursday, Noonan told parliament that while the downside was "definite," any 
upside was only speculative, referring to the possibility that some companies keen to stay in the EU might move 
from Britain to Ireland. Irish exporters will be the first to suffer, as the pound weakened significantly against the 
euro, making their euro-priced goods more expensive. Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan told Reuters on 
Wednesday that the government will have to consider helping firms exporting into Britain. Farmers and food 
producers, major UK suppliers, are especially vulnerable. "This development is unambiguously negative for the Irish 
economy," said Philip O'Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland. Of most concern to Dublin is the impact on 
Northern Ireland, which has the only land frontier between the United Kingdom and the rest of the EU. It was 
marked by military checkpoints until a 1998 peace deal ended three decades of sectarian violence. Flanagan said 
the reintroduction of a hard border would have to be considered in any negotiation and that the return of controls, 
for customs or security, could pose a difficult challenge for the peace process. The dismantling of military border 
posts was a key aspect of the peace deal between Catholic nationalists seeking a united Ireland and Protestant 
unionists who wanted to keep Northern Ireland British. Over 3,600 died in the conflict. Northern Ireland's pro-British 
First Minister Foster dismissed the call by her deputy, McGuinness, for a vote on Irish unity as "opportunistic." 
Britain's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland may call such a vote at any time, according to the 1998 agreement. 
It also specifies that the Secretary "shall" order a referendum if it appears likely that a majority of those voting would 
seek to form part of a united Ireland. "There is no way even if there was a border poll that it would be in favor of a 
united Ireland," Democratic Unionist Party leader Foster told Northern Ireland's Radio Ulster. (Reuters) Source:

absolutely massive. This could have very profound implications for our economy (in Northern Ireland)." The call 
from Sinn Fein, Northern Ireland's largest Irish nationalist party, was rebuffed by pro-British First Minister Arlene 
Foster and Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, who said there were much more serious issues to deal with. Kenny 
called an emergency cabinet meeting shortly after the result and afterwards published a plan his government had 
prepared in advance, listing actions it would take over trade, investment, British-Irish relations and Northern Ireland. 
Unabiguously negative Ireland's central bank had warned that a withdrawal would hurt economic growth and jobs 
and significantly impact the financial sector, while a government-commissioned report found it could cut trade with 
Britain by at least 20 percent. Irish banks, whose exposure to the UK accounts for around 21 percent of total assets,

16 percent earlier on Friday. The yield on Ireland's benchmark 10-year bonds [IE10YT=TWEB] was marginally 
higher at a near record low 0.84 percent. The country's debt agency said its funding position was strong with limited 
financing needs for the rest of the year and through the first half of 2017. The cost of insuring exposure to Irish 
government debt nearly doubled on Friday, surging to the highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years. Finance Minister 
Michael Noonan, who earlier this week said an estimated cumulative Brexit-related hit on the Irish economy of as 
much as 1.6 percent of GDP would be "containable", said the outcome would not derail his immediate budget plans. 
"There is nothing catastrophic for Irish fiscal policy on the horizon," Noonan told national broadcaster RTE with the 
caveat that the hit to economic growth could limit his budget plans beyond 2018. Investec Ireland said it will likely 
cut its GDP forecasts for 2016 and 2017 that are currently in line with government predictions of 5 and 4 percent,

calling the referendum result "unambiguously negative" for the Irish economy. Davy Stockbrokers said that while it 
did not think a Brexit will be sufficient to push Ireland into recession, it could lower growth by 1 to 2 percent in both 
years. Ratings agency S...aid Brexit had no immediate impact on Ireland's sovereign ratings and it expected the 
Irish economy to stay resilient enough to withstand the negative impacts. Brexit may not be all bad for Ireland, and 
Noonan said there may be some upside if companies keen to stay in the EU moved to Dublin from London. The 
contingency plan calls for marketing efforts to be intensified in sectors like financial services for firms wanting to be 
based in the EU. Border controls But of most concern to Dublin is the impact on Northern Ireland, which has the

and excise controls, including the role of modern technology, would be analyzed with a view to minimizing trade 
restrictions.

Jun 22, 2016( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex) After absorbing 
months of campaigning, voters in the U.K. are headed to the polls Thursday to decide whether to remain in the 
European Union. Amid tight polls with only a day to go before voting, here's everything you need to know about the 
vote, the issues driving both sides and the economic implications. What is Brexit? The popularity of combining 
celebrity couple names has crossed into the realm of European politics. 
Brexit is a combination of 'Britain' and 'exit' and has become the shorthand name for Thursday's referendum. The 
official question voters will be asked is: 'Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or 
leave the European Union?' This is the first vote of its kind in the history of the economic and political bloc in its 
modern form. Why is the vote happening? The U.K. and the EU have had a rocky relationship in recent years. The 
U.K. joined the EU in 1973[1] and today 73 members of the European Parliament hail from the U.K. Prime Minister 
David Cameron promised to hold a referendum on U.K. membership in the EU if he was re-elected in 2015 and he 
has kept his word. Both the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) and Cameron's own Conservative Party have pushed 
for the vote. Pro-EU supporters hold placards and banners during a 'Yes to Europe' rally in London's Trafalgar 
Square, ahead of Thursday's EU referendum, on June 21, 2016. Photo: NIKLAS HALLE'N/AFP/Getty Images Who 
gets to vote? While the deadline to register to vote has already passed, anyone registered to vote[2] in the U.K. is 
eligible to take part in the referendum. Commonwealth citizens living in the U.K. as well as Gibraltar, British citizens 
living overseas who have registered to vote in the last 15 years and Irish citizens who were born in Northern Ireland 
are all eligible to cast a ballot. While voting by post and proxy are both possibilities, budget airline Ryanair ran a 'Fly 
Home to Vote Remain' sales campaign (the airline supports Britain staying[3] in the EU). '[The] seat sale proved 
extremely popular, so much so that we extended it for 24 hours,' Ryanair told International Business Times in an 
email. What has the campaign looked like and what are the issues? Campaigning has been intense over the last 
several months. The 'leave' camp[4] has argued that the referendum presents the opportunity for Britain to take 
back control it has lost in the large EU bureaucracy and has highlighted the amount of money sent every week to 
Brussels, the capital of the EU. Immigration has also been in the spotlight with the 'leave' camp arguing, 'We will 
control our borders.' The 'leave' camp has argued Britain would have greater control over its own economy outside 
of the EU.https://twitter.com/vote_leave/status/745324472316502016The 'remain' camp[5] has argued that the U.K. 
is 'stronger, safer and better off in Europe.' While admitting to problems with the EU, the 'remain' camp has focused 
its energy on the economic argument, stressing that British jobs and trade are tied to the EU and that the EU adds 
billions of dollars to the British economy every year. Staying in the EU is the status quo choice that many business 
executives have called for. Who are the biggest 'leave' and 'remain' supporters? From retired soccer player David 
Everything To Know About Brexit
Beckham ('remain') to British-born American TV host John Oliver ('remain') and actress Elizabeth Hurley ('leave'), 
celebrities, CEOs and political leaders have been taking stands[6] on which way they want to the vote to go.           
https://twitter.com/StrongerIn/status/745316210645016576On the political front, Cameron is leading the 'remain' 
side while UKIP party leader Nigel Farage has been rallying the 'leave' side. Business leaders from Coca-Cola to 
JPMorgan Chase, fearing economic implications of Britain outside of the EU, have come out urging voters to 
choose 'remain.'Play Video[7] What happens if the U.K. votes to leave? The short answer is no one really knows. If 
the U.K. does vote to leave, it would be the first country to do so. Experts estimate it could take several years for 
the country to work out new trade relations with the EU. The U.K. is the world's fifth-largest economy[8] and many 
businesses use it as a jumping-off point to the Europeanwide market. That has economists and business owners 
worried[9] about trade arrangements, currency fluctuations and slower economic growth in the U.K. If the 'leave' 
vote wins, economists have predicted the British pound could weaken against the dollar. The Bank of England has 
warned that uncertainty over the referendum is the 'largest immediate risk'[10] to financial markets around the 
globe. Is the vote binding? No, it is not legally binding. Parliament will still have to pass laws[11] for the U.K. to exit 
the EU, but it is unlikely Parliament would go against the people's decision. There is no minimum turnout needed, 
and to win the vote a simple majority is needed. When will we know the results? Polls will close at 10 p.m. GMT (6 
p.m. EDT)and local results will be declared as they come in. Around 4 a.m. local time it should start to become clear 
which side has the lead, the BBC reported[12]. The final result will be announced at the Manchester Town Hall. [ 1]:

Body
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary warned on Tuesday of a two to three-year economic downturn if Britain votes to 
leave the European Union and said that Brussels has been given a "wake-up call" regardless of the result of 
Thursday's UK referendum.
Speaking at an aviation conference in Paris, the head of the Irish budget carrier -- Europe's largest airline by 
passenger numbers -- said that economic and political disruption could weaken the rest of the 28-nation bloc if UK 
voters back a so-called Brexit.
"If Brits vote to exit, I think the European Union as a project is doomed," O'Leary said. "I think they will inevitably be 
followed by others. I think you would have a two or three-year economic downturn with huge uncertainty that would 
be very bad, not just for the UK economy but for the European economy, which is already struggling."
The Irish entrepreneur is one of the most vocal business leaders urging voters to back continued European Union 
membership in Thursday's referendum. Both sides in the closely fought contest claim significant business support. 
"In my business it depends very much on what the exit looks like," O'Leary told the Paris Air Forum, hosted by La 
Tribune. But he suggested that a vote to leave would penalise a generation that grew up on cheap connectivity to 
the rest of Europe and put at risk a system of unrestricted routes on which Ryanair and other budget airlines have 
built rapid growth. Analysts say it is still unclear whether Britain, Ryanair's biggest single market, would continue to 
have unfettered access to EU airports under complex aviation rules. O'Leary was speaking before travelling to 
London to join the climax of the campaign, alternating between defending membership of a reformed EU and 
criticising its bureaucracy. "Even if Britain votes to remain, Europe and certainly Brussels has had a wake-up call," 
he said, adding that a clear message has already been sent to the EU's bureaucracy. "If you guys in Brussels don't

... start improving the single market and improving the lives of Europe's citizens, this thing is going to fall apart." 
Ryanair has often clashed with the European Commission over passenger compensation, taxes and other issues. It 
is now lobbying for a clampdown by European authorities on repeated air traffic controller strikes. Willie Walsh, 
head of British Airways owner IAG, has been more cautious about the impact of a Brexit, saying that it would "not 
have a material impact" on his business. (Reuters) Source: www.businessworld.ie

The owners of Ireland's Ryanair Holdings Plc aim to bring budget air travel to Argentina in 2017, co-founder Declan 
Ryan told newspaper La Nacion after meeting with government officials in the South American nation.
La Nacion reported the move would likely come through an acquisition, and said Salta-based Andes Laneas Aereas 
is a target, citing anonymous sources.
Ryanair is present in Mexico and Colombia through investments by its holding company Irelandia Aviation in other 
airlines. Irelandia Aviation said about dollar 50 million was needed to start operations with an initial fleet of five 
aircraft, according to La Nacion.
Ryan said he was optimistic about Argentine President Mauricio Macri's economic reforms but noted high inflation 
and corruption in the country were still concerns. "We have started negotiating with all the countries in the region 
except for Brazil where there is lots of corruption," he told the paper. Ryan did not specify possible routes in 
Argentina, but said he was surprised to learn students frequently traveled 20 hours by bus to the mountains of 
Bariloche, noting budget airlines could compete with bus fares. (Reuters) Source: www.businessworld.ie

Low-cost carriers continue to fly the path to big profits
Low-cost carriers continue to fly the path to big profits
Flight International

Low-cost carrier (LCC) traffic, revenue and profit figures continued to grow in 2015, as the spread of the model 
showed no sign of abating.
The latest Flightglobal/Airline Business low-cost carrier survey shows strong growth among leading carriers in the 
sector. Passenger numbers among the top 100 low-cost and leisure carriers in 2015 topped 1.1 billion: an increase 
of almost 11% over the previous year.
LCC revenues and profits, especially among the sector’s biggest players, were also up sharply in local currencies. 
However, big exchange rate movements against the strong US dollar mean this growth does not show when these 
figures are converted for comparison purposes.
When Ryanair ended the 2015 calendar year by passing the 100 million passenger mark, it further underlined the 
huge expansion the low-cost sector has continued to experience over recent years.
The Irish carrier became the second operator in the segment to reach the milestone, with 106 million passengers on 
an earned-seat basis for its financial year to March 2016. That reflects a return to double-digit passenger growth, 
after an hiatus ensuing from delays in sealing a follow-up aircraft order. It has added 25 million passengers in two 
years after putting its foot back on the accelerator. During this period, its fleet has increased from just under 300 
Boeing narrowbodies to almost 350.
Southwest Airlines remains the largest LCC in the world, carrying just shy of 145 million passengers last year. Its 
own passenger levels were sharply increased after its acquisition of AirTran, which was fully integrated at the end of 
2014.Between them, Southwest and Ryanair carried over 250 million passengers in 2015, accounting for almost a 
quarter of the 1.1 billion passengers the sector handled last year.going strongBut growth over recent years has 
been strong across the sector. Fourteen airlines each carried over 20 million passengers in 2015 and the 20 biggest 
operators had a combined passenger count of 713 million. By contrast, this stood at 420 million for the biggest 20 
LCC airlines in 2008.
Low-cost carriers continue to fly the path to big profits
More striking still is the individual growth shown by the 20 biggest LCCs in 2015 compared with their performances 
in 2008. These carriers have more than doubled collective passenger numbers over that period, some emerging 
virtually from scratch. Brazil’s Azul, the 12th biggest operator in 2015 with over 20 million passengers, only 
launched in December 2008.
Azul, aided by its acquisition of Brazilian regional operator Trip, is among the fastest-growing airlines over this 
period, together with Indian carrier IndiGo and Indonesia’s Lion Air. IndiGo, which listed on the Mumbai stock 
exchange last year, has grown from just below five million passengers in 2008 to over 31 million. Lion has gone 
from seven million passengers in 2008 to an estimated 32 million last year, although its rapid expansion has been 
tempered more recently after slowing its capacity growth.
This illustrates the rapid expansion of LCCs within emerging markets. In 2008, only four Asia-Pacific carriers ranked 
among the 20 biggest low-cost operators. That had reached six carriers by 2015. Virgin Australia – which has since 
repositioned as a network operator – was the only Asian carrier in 2008’s top 10. But IndiGo, Lion and AirAsia were 
all among the biggest carriers last year. The latter, which has doubled in size since 2008, has also developed a 
series of affiliate carriers in the region.
Not that European carriers have been left behind. Alongside the established pan-European pair of Ryanair and 
EasyJet, the likes of Norwegian, Pegasus, Vueling and Wizz Air have each more than trebled passenger levels 
since 2008.North American carriers, too – including JetBlue Airways, Virgin America, WestJet and the ultra-low-cost 
pair of Allegiant Air and Spirit Airlines – have all grown significantly during this period.
The continued impressive expansion across the sector has been achieved despite a slowdown in some key growth 
markets in Asia and Brazil.
The strong year will further increase the sector’s share of overall traffic, which has already climbed from 
representing less than 10% of passengers carried by the top 150 global airlines in 2008 to more than a quarter in 
2014.
The largest share of passengers for low-cost and leisure carriers among the leading 100 operators comes from 
Europe – which represents almost 38% of the sector; followed by the Asia-Pacific and North American markets.
Revenues for all but six of the 50 biggest airlines in the sector in 2015 covered by the report increased in local 
currency, although the sharp movements against the US dollar mean that, in several cases, they fall when 
converted into dollars for comparison purposes.
Revenues in local currency were down at only one carrier among the 20 biggest low-cost operators: Gol, as it 
battled Brazil’s economic challenges. Figures are not available for another of the country’s major LCCs, Azul.
Profits also continue to rise. At a net level, the 20 most profitable LCCs, for which figures are available, made a 
combined profit of $8.2 billion last year. That compares to $5.1 billion among the top 20 by net profit in 2014. The 
four biggest – EasyJet, JetBlue, Ryanair and Southwest – all posted operating profits topping $1 billion for their 
most recent financial years, and combined operating profit of $8 billion.
profits soar
Southwest remains the biggest LCC, generating revenues of almost $20 billion in 2015 and, in line with the strong 
profits across US airlines in the year, an operating profit of more than $4 billion.
Revenues were also up sharply at the fourth-biggest airline by revenue, JetBlue, which more than doubled 
operating profit for 2015. North American carriers, echoing the wider picture, led in LCC profitability. Six of the nine 
most profitable carriers at a net level were from North America, as Allegiant, Spirit, Virgin America and WestJet join 
Southwest and JetBlue.
Low-cost carriers continue to fly the path to big profits
Ireland’s Ryanair increased operating profit 40%, and net profit 43%, in local currency for the year ended March, to 
reach a new high – even before accounting for the one-off gains made from the sale of its largely written-down Aer 
Lingus stake.

Ryanair has been forced to cancel 44 flights today to/from and over France in what will be the 50th French strike 
since 2009 and 10th in the past 12 weeks.
The airline has called on the European Commission to take action to prevent the skies over Europe being closed by 
French ATC union strikes which they say are targeting the European Championships.
Ryanair advised customers travelling today to check the status of their flight on the Ryanair.com website before 
travelling to the airport.
Ryanair's Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs commented, "These ongoing strikes by the French ATC unions 
are being directly aimed not only at families taking a well-deserved summer holidaybut also at the millions of 
football fans coming to France this summer for the Euros." He added, "It is shocking that a small group of unionized 
workers can hold a continent of football fans to ransom, and we regret that once again we have been forced to 
cancel a number of flights due to the selfish actions of these workers." Source: www.businessworld.ie

Shares in Fastjet rose 14 per cent yesterday after the Africa-focused airline poached the boss of a rival carrier to 
lead its turnround efforts.
Nico Bezuidenhout , chief executive of South African Airways subsidiary Mango Airlines, is moving to take up the 
same role at London-listed Fastjet in August.
Fastjet started its African services in 2012, emulating the model that easyJet and Ryanair have used in Europe, but 
its shares have fallen 98 per cent over the past three years.
Political troubles and economic weakness in Tanzania, Fastjet's main market, have led to a series of profit warnings 
, and last week the company reported a pre-tax loss of $21.6m for 2015.
Fastjet has been without a chief executive since March, when Ed Winter stepped down after pressure from Sir 
Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the company's second-largest shareholder and founder of easyJet.
Colin Child , Fastjet's executive chairman, said Mr Bezuidenhout's decision to join the company "is a vote of 
confidence in the concept. He's given up a very good job at Mango and isn't wanting to step backwards".
Sir Stelios welcomed Mr Bezuidenhout's appointment as "better late than never," but renewed his criticism of Mr 
Child, saying he "is not the right man for the job of chairman".
Fastjet appoints new top manager Airlines
Last month easyGroup, Sir Stelios's private investment vehicle through which he holds his shares in Fastjet, 
requested a special shareholder meeting to remove Mr Child, saying it had "lost faith in Colin Child being able to 
turn the company around".
Sir Stelios had criticised Fastjet in a public letter in March, and questioned its ability to service its debts.
Mango is one of only a few low-cost carriers to become profitable in Africa, reporting earnings in eight of the past 10 
years. Mr Bezuidenhout has led the airline since it was established in 2006, and served two stints as interim chief 
executive of SAA.
Mr Child said "neither [Mr Bezuidenhout] nor we are hiding from the fact it's a challenging environment, but the 
more I see the more I am convinced that this is a market that's going to happen".
He said a number of the institutional investors in the company indicated they were "delighted that we've got 
someone of Nico's calibre", and said he was hopeful the company could avoid further disputes with shareholders. 
Fastjet's shares rose 14 per cent to 29.5p.

BUDGET airline Ryanair will launch an accommodation service, offering customers a choice of hotels, hostels and 
more at the lowest prices.
Its low-price accommodation service, Ryanair Rooms, will launch from 1 October, in a bid to expand its offering to 
its 116m customers and compete with the likes of Airbnb.
The service will offer hotels, hostels, B&Bs, holiday villas and homestay options, via the www.Ryanair.com website, 
but pledges that whatever is chosen will always be at the lowest prices.
"With Ryanair Rooms, we're going to transform booking accommod-ation," said Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs.
"More and more customers are looking to Ryanair for products other than flights, and we see this as a natural 
progression towards www.Ryanair.com becoming the Amazon of air travel.

Shares in Fastjet rose 14 per cent yesterday after the Africa-focused airline poached the boss of a rival carrier to 
lead its turnround efforts.
Nico Bezuidenhout , chief executive of Mango Airlines, a South African Airways subsidiary, is to take up the 
equivalent role in the London-listed group in August.
Fastjet started its African services in 2012, aiming to copy the low-cost model of easyJet and Ryanair. Its shares 
have fallen 98 per cent in three years. Political and economic woes in Tanzania, its main market, have led to a 
series of profit warnings , and last week Fastjet reported a pre-tax loss of $21.6m for 2015.
The carrier has been without a chief executive since March, when Ed Winter stepped down after pressure from 
Stelios Haji-Ioannou , the easyJet founder who is the second-largest shareholder.
Sir Stelios welcomed Mr Bezuidenhout's appointment but renewed his criticism of Colin Child, saying he was "not 
the right man for the job of chairman".
In a public letter in March Sir Stelios had questioned Fastjet's ability to service its debts.
Mango is one of the few low-cost carriers in Africa to make a profit. Mr Bezuidenhout led the airline since it was 
established in 2006.

AS THE 23 June referendum creeps ever closer, businesses are joining politicians in nailing their colours to the 
mast over Britain's membership of the EU.
Over the next couple of weeks, more organisations and business leaders will make their views public as voters 
agonise over their decision. Two brands that have already jumped in to the Brexit debate on opposite sides of the 
fence are budget airline Ryanair and pub chain JD Wetherspoon.
Ryanair boss, Michael O'Leary, has pushed for Britain to remain a mem-ber, while Wetherspoon chief, Tim Martin, 
wants to leave.
Both are using the business tools at their disposal to push politics, with the pub chain producing 200,000 anti-EU 
beermats, and the budget airline reportedly emailing its subscribers with a call for them to register for the vote.
Using YouGov Profiles, we can assess how these overt political actions will resonate with customers of both 
brands.
Ryanair customers are significantly more likely than the average punter to favour remaining in the EU.
Over half of the people who fly with the company want to stay (55 per cent), as opposed to fewer than four in 10 (37 
per cent) who want to leave. There are eight per cent who are yet to be convinced either way.
JD Wetherspoon customers are a little closer to the national average and pretty evenly split on the issue, with 45 
per cent wanting to leave and 46 per cent identifying as Remainians.
Both brands entering the political fray in such a public way has attracted more headlines for them.
Pint or flight? Brands are vying for your EU view
YouGov BrandIndex data shows that there has been an increase in the number of people talking about both 
Ryanair and Wetherspoon with their colleagues, friends and family.
Ryanair in particular has seen its Attention score rise to a yearly high of 25 in recent days, up from 14 in the middle 
of the month.
More organisations will enter the debate in the next two weeks.
What we don't yet know is whether overt political interventions from brands on either side of the referendum debate 
will harm their standing among customers who take a different view towards the EU.

Stobart Air axing routes between Dublin and Britain

Highlight: Routes from Dublin to East Midlands, Doncaster-Sheffield, and Cardiff to be axed
Body
Stobart Air is to axe three of the routes it operates from Dublin to Britain as part of its franchise deal with Aer 
Lingus, this newspaper has learned. 
The airline confirmed that Aer Lingus Regional routes between Dublin and East Midlands, Dublin and Doncaster-
Sheffield, and Dublin and Cardiff will cease with effect from November 1. 
It said it had plans to increase services on other routes and that all scheduled flights on the impacted routes would 
operate as normal between now and  October 31. 
The routes are operated as part of a wider franchise agreement with Aer Lingus that has long been seen as a key 
part of plans to turn Dublin into a transatlantic hub for US-bound passengers from Britain. 
But Stobart may soon face increased competition for those transfer passengers with negotiations under way 
between Aer Lingus and Ryanair that could see Michael O’Leary’s airline coordinating up to 50 of its short-haul 
routes into Dublin to allow for transfers on to Aer Lingus’ transatlantic services. 
The axing of the three UK services also comes at a time of heightened speculation around the future ownership and 
direction of Stobart Air after its chief executive Seán Brogan resigned last month after a board rejection of his 
management buyout bid for the carrier. 
But a spokesman for Stobart said that “these commercial decisions are the result of a systematic review of our Aer 
Lingus Regional route network which will see increases on other routes across the network later this year. The 2016 
winter schedule will be released for sale over the next two weeks. 
“Stobart Air’s continued growth is driven by its strategic and commercial focus on route development and 
performance. 
Stobart Air axing routes between Dublin and Britain
“This approach affords us the flexibility to respond to new opportunities and to make the necessary decisions on 
routes in order to protect and drive our continued growth,” he said. 
Meanwhile, Aer Lingus chief executive Stephen Kavanagh told this newspaper that his airline is on course to create 
more jobs than it promised the government it would do as part of last year’s IAG deal to buy the state’s 25 per cent 
stake. 
The airline last May pledged it would create 635 net new jobs by 2020. 
“I’m very confident that we will overshoot. If you look in 2016 alone we have added three aircraft to the north 
Atlantic, opening three new gateways. The aspiration at the time of transaction was five over a five-year period.” 
But Kavanagh refused to be specific about how many new jobs he now thought Aer Lingus could create because 
“at this moment there are too many imponderables”. 
“But we have 2.5 per cent of market share between Europe and North America. That’s a very low share position 
and a great opportunity. Even small changes in that market share are significant in terms of the size and scope of 
our operation,” he said.

Transdev could learn lessons from Irish Ferries
Transdev could learn lessons from Irish Ferries

Highlight: ICG has kept its head down and concentrated on strengthening the business
Body
If the managers at Luas operator Transdev are looking for lessons in how to regain lost ground after a costly and 
disruptive strike, they could do worse than to look to Dublin Port for lessons. 
Irish Ferries, a company with a troubled industrial relations past, has gone from strength to strength since the end of 
a bitter two-year industrial dispute that ended in 2006. 
The announcement last week that its publicly quoted parent company Irish Continental Group is to invest €144 
million to build a new cruise ferry was further evidence of a company with the wind in its sails. 
An unsuccessful management buyout attempt aside, ICG management has kept its head down ever since and 
concentrated on strengthening the business. 
In recent years, as the recession ended and exports and imports rose, ICG was an obvious early beneficiary. 
Its previous unsavoury ruthlessness on staff costs, and, more particularly, falling fuel costs boosted profits. 
Savvy management played a part, particularly in how it has bought and sold ships and other assets. For example, 
last November, as demand continued to recover across the Irish Sea, the company spent €24 million on four 
container vessels. 
It was a bargain deal, effectively giving it four vessels for the price of one. 
Management will hope that its most recent decision to invest in the new ferry will ultimately prove equally as savvy. 
The new ferry will accommodate 1,855 passengers and crew, with 435 cabins and with capacity for 165 freight 
vehicles, plus a car deck that can cater for 300 cars. 
Transdev could learn lessons from Irish Ferries
Not for the first time, Irish Ferries has opted to follow the lead of Ireland’s most successful transport company, 
Ryanair. 
The airline’s massive orders of Boeing 737 aircraft in the past have not just provided for growth but have driven it. 
Irish Ferries management, with a brand new high-spec ship to market, will hope the €144 million investment will 
have a similar positive impact. 
Nevertheless, where Ryanair has an entire continent into which to place its steady flow of new aircraft, Irish Ferries 
is effectively limited to a few routes between Ireland and Britain and France. 
Its belief that it can fill its brand new ship day after day, as competition increases both at sea and in the air, is 
dependent on continued economic growth here in Ireland. 
Of course, like a canny poker player, before taking the big punt on a new ship, ICG took a smaller each way bet. 
The new ship will actually replace the Epsilon, a chartered ferry, which was introduced on to the Dublin to Holyhead 
route in December 2013. 
Back then, the market was just beginning to grow again and the recovery appeared altogether more shaky. 
The Epsilon was brought in to test the waters and, such was the rapid growth in passenger numbers, was proving 
too small a ship for the company’s expanding needs. 
The Epsilon’s lease runs out at the end of this year so a decision was needed whether to lease a bigger ship or take 
the plunge and invest in a new one. 
The decision to invest in the new vessel is a sign of ICG’s ambition. It is also a vote of confidence in the Irish 
economy and clear evidence that, for one transport company at least, there is plenty of life after industrial turmoil 
regardless of negative publicity.

Decades after long-range airliners endedIreland's role as the stepping stone to Europe for Americans, who sipped 
Irish coffees as their propeller-driven planes refuelled, the country is slowly re-establishing itself as a major 
transatlantic aviation hub.
Last year Dublin for the first time entered the top-five rankings for transatlantic hubs in Europe, data showed, after 
British Airways owner IAG started to implement plans to use Dublin as an alternative to the continent's top hub at 
London Heathrow.
With Irish low-cost giant Ryanair considering using its fleet to feed long-haul services, senior airline executives at 
the first annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association to be held in Dublin since 1962 talked up 
prospects for further growth.
"It's an absolutely enormous opportunity for Dublin," said Pat Byrne, chief executive of Irish regional airline CityJet, 
which announced plans to double its fleet to 50 planes. "The last timeIrelandhas had this significance (for 
transatlantic travel) was when airplanes had to stop to fuel." In the 1940s and 50s U.S. presidents and movie stars 
would stop off near Shannon on the west coast ofIrelandbefore flying on to Europe's great cities, bringing a touch of 
glamour to one of the most under-developed regions in Western Europe. Locals claim the Irish Coffee, finished with 
a dash of whiskey, was invented by a local barman catering for the visiting stars. But the airport went into decades 
of decline when long-range jets could fly further. Ireland's resurgence has been fuelled in recent years by strong

the first four months of the year, the Dublin Airport Authority said. Heathrow had 230,000 transatlantic seats 
available weekly at the peak of last summer compared with fifth-placed Dublin with 41,000, according to aviation 
data and analytics company OAG. Dublin has focused on the 25 regional UK airports it has direct flights to, but the 
focus is shifting towards other parts of western Europe, said Dublin Airport Authority chief executive Kevin Toland. 
The next stage could be to harness Ryanair, whose second largest base in Europe is Dublin, with 86 destinations. 
Long averse to connecting flights due to logistical difficulties, Ryanair has said it will experiment with connections 
this summer with a view to feeding long haul airlines in the future. But Ryanair Chief Commercial Officer David 
O'Brien told Reuters it would need a "stronger compelling economic reason" before it starts regular feeds for rival 
carriers. Executives also citedIreland's pro-business regulator as a plus. The Irish Aviation Authority has been 
pushing to allow Norwegian Air Shuttle's Irish subsidiary to start flying transatlantic routes, despite heavy resistance 
from U.S. carriers against it. Aer Lingus Chief Executive Stephen Kavanagh, who has been spearheading his 
airline's hub plan since its takeover by IAG last year, said the key to further growth is being opportunistic, poaching 
passengers from overcrowded hubs in Europe and the United States. "Poor airports in North America is an 
opportunity to connect cities on the east coast directly to Dublin," he said. "We have such a small home market, we 
have to be internationally relevant in everything we do." (Reuters) Source: www.businessworld.ie

Ryanair, the Irish no-frills airline, has cut baggage fees for the vast majority of its passengers and simplified its 
luggage options in another effort to repair its reputation for poor customer service.
The Dublin-based short-haul carrier said that it would reduce baggage fees for checked-in items for 92 per cent of 
customers and attempt to tackle confusion around the fees by cutting the options from 108 down to six.
Those flying for less than two hours will find fees cut by 50 per cent, while travellers on flights of less than three 
hours will save up to 17 per cent. Baggage fees for passengers flying for more than three hours will remain the 
same.
Yesterday, the company announced passenger traffic grew to 10.6m in May, a 12 per cent year-on-year rise, 
despite a difficult period for the European travel industry, which has been hit by terrorist attacks and strikes. 
Following two profit warnings in autumn 2013, Michael O'Leary , chief executive, admitted the company had 
annoyed too many customers and announced a strategic overhaul. He scrapped or lowered a number of hated 
fees, including charges for failing to print out boarding cards in advance of arriving at the airport.
Ryanair has also introduced more flexible tickets for business passengers as it tries to attract customers who have 
traditionally shunned budget airlines.
Kenny Jacobs, chief marketing officer, said the baggage fee reductions formed part of this programme.

In February, the company said that it intended to return EUR800m to investors this year through its largest ever 
share buyback programme, while reporting third-quarter net profit of EUR102.7m, up 110 per cent compared with 
the same period in 2014.

Ryanair has done us all a favour. Henceforth, instead of having 108 baggage options when we book our flights, we 
will have only six. For this we are supposed to be thankful.
By the time Lombard has made it to the baggage options page, enthusiasm for the booking has long since waned. 
Who knows how much a bag is likely to weigh in several months' time?
Still, others would do well to follow Ryanair's lead. TV companies, energy suppliers, fund managers and countless 
others all do very nicely out of befuddling the public with 100 subtly different options. But there is a certain beauty in 
simplicity.

Body
Ryanair is to close its main base in Norway and cut half of its flights to the Nordic country in retaliation for Oslo's 
decision to introduce a tax on air travel.
The Irish low-cost airline announced its decision to close its base at Oslo Rygge - which in turn is likely to shut 
down the airport itself - on the day that Norway introduced the tax of NKr80 ($9.60) per passenger for international 
flights and NKr88 for domestic journeys.
Ryanair will start flying to London and Vilnius daily from Oslo's main Gardermoen airport and move some flights to 
Torp, an airport 75 minutes south-west of the capital, but 16 routes in all will be cancelled, reducing Ryanair's flights 
by a half to Norway.
Norway and Ryanair have been in a stand-off for some time over various issues, from labour conditions and pay to 
the introduction of the tax.
Erna Solberg, Norway's centre-right prime minister, said last week: "This government will not be blackmailed by 
Ryanair."
David O'Brien , Ryanair's chief commercial officer, called the introduction of the tax illogical and unfair as it 
penalised the Irish airline more than local rivals SAS and Norwegian Air Shuttle, which often have higher fares.
Ryanair hits back over Norway air tax Airlines
Both SAS and Norwegian have also criticised the tax.
He deflected criticism from the Norwegian government that Ryanair was merely using the tax as cover to close 
down its Rygge base.
"Call our bluff . . . I want to make it clear: the only reason we are closing it down is the new tax," Mr O'Brien said, 
adding that Ryanair would reopen the base if the tax was withdrawn.
Ryanair claimed Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands had all scrapped similar taxes.
Rygge airport, which is located near Moss, about 45 minutes south of Oslo, has already said it will close down later 
this year if Ryanair shut its base.
Ms Solberg said yesterday that the government would not back down.
"They drive a hard bargain, they have done that in many other countries. The question is whether all countries 
should just give in. There are many countries that have chosen not to change their tax policies despite Ryanair's 
pressure."
She added: "NKr88 per flight is not a reason for such a powerful company not to continue at Rygge."
It is not Ryanair's first brush with Scandinavian countries.
The Irish airline threatened to pull out of Denmark last year after a labour court allowed Danish trade unions to 
blockade and strike against Ryanair aircraft.
Ryanair then closed down its base in Billund, home to Legoland, but at the end of last year claimed that the dispute 
had served to boost its business there, making its Danish flights 90 per cent full.

Highlight: Christoph Mueller goes on leave and new leader takes the helm tomorrow.
Body
Group managing director and CEO of Malaysia Airlines Berhad (MAB) Christoph Mueller will go on leave on 1 July 
and step down from the MAB board, with his newly-appointed replacement Peter Bellew taking the helm of the 
restructuring Malaysian flag carrier.
Mueller resigned from his position on 10 March and is serving his notice period until 9 September. He will "remain 
available to the company until the end of his notice period to help ensure a smooth leadership transition."
A spokesperson for the airline did not immediately respond to a request for clarification as to what "remain 
available" means.
Malaysia Airlines said it has been looking for a new CEO since April and that the process has involved internal and 
external as well as local and foreign candidates.
Bellew, a former Ryanair executive, has been a member of MAB's senior management team since 1 September 
2015, when the company started operations. The airline said his appointment will "ensure continuity in the 
execution of the Malaysia Airlines turnaround plan and further progress of the overall restructuring effort, as set out 
by Khazanah in its 12-point MAS Recovery Plan".
"It also allows for an accelerated and seamless leadership transition from Mr Mueller," the airline added.
Airfinance Journal reported on 28 June that Bellew had been made an executive director of the board.
Although Mueller has not publicly disclosed where he will work next, an unconfirmed report by German-language 
publicationManager Magazindated 26 June says that he will join Dubai-based carrier Emirates as its chief 
transformation officer in charge of "digitalisation".
"I'm afraid Malaysia Airlines is not able to comment on Mr Mueller's next steps," a spokesperson for Malaysia 
Airlines told Airfinance Journal when asked to comment on the Manager Magazin report.
Malaysia Airlines appoints new CEO
As part of its restructuring, Malaysia Airlines is reducing its fleet and optimising routes. The old company Malaysian 
Airline System (MAS) sub-leased all its aircraft to a newly created company Malaysian Airlines Berhad (MAB). 
Banks and lessors with exposure to Malaysia Airlines were asked last year to consent to the proposal and the 
airline has been in negotiations with its creditors to try to secure reductions in lease rentals and loan principal 
payments, as well as the return of some aircraft.

Highlight: Restructuring Malaysian flag carrier says loss will be smaller than initially budgeted.
Body
Malaysia Airlines, which is undergoing financial restructuring process, expects to report a loss for fiscal year 2016, 
according to a statement from the airline.
It adds, however, that the loss would be "significantly smaller than initially budgeted at the beginning of the year, 
and ahead of the turnaround plan for the airline to be sustainably profitable by 2018".
In the first quarter, revenue was down 21.7%, while ASK (available seat kilometres) decreased 30.2%. Average 
yield per passenger rose 23.4% against the same quarter in 2015, but the overall load factor of 68.9% was lower, 
though is now "trending upward".
"The market environment is showing strong signs of improvement in China and North Asia. Route profitability also 
improved in Australasia, although demand in certain markets remains week," the airline says.
The airline has ordered two additional Airbus A350-900s, adding to the original four it has on order. This is to "reach 
a critical fleet size which allows for scheduled maintenance and future network expansion".
Malaysia Airlines says preparation for the introduction of these aircraft, planned for late 2017, is ahead of schedule 
with initial pilot and engineering training "well underway".
This year, all the airline's A380s will undergo a C-check, which will be performed in-house for the first time.
"Even though personal circumstances mean I will not complete my full term as chief executive, I am confident that 
the foundations are now in place for the national carrier to achieve sustainable profitability in the stated timeframe 
and regain its rightful place as a symbol of national pride," says Christoph Mueller, the airline's chief.
Malaysia Airlines says Mueller has expressed a desire to continue to remain on the board of directors as a non-
executive director "if circumstances permit". The airline's board has appointed current chief operating officer and 
former Ryanair executive Peter Bellew as executive director of the board with immediate effect "[i]n order to 
facilitate a smooth transition" when Mueller leaves.

Although Mueller "" who is serving out a six-month notice period after announcing his resignation in April "" has not

Highlight: Ryanair Ltd., an Irish airline, has opened its new European training center in London Stansted Airport.
Body
Ryanair confirmed that it will create over 1,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew, and engineers in 2016, more than 
450 of which will be located at Ryanair's 13 UK airport bases to support its 14 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft, an 
investment of over $1.4bn in the British economy. These new jobs will bring to more than 3,500 well paid aviation 
professionals that Ryanair employs directly in Britain, in addition to sustaining thousands of support jobs at 
Ryanair's 18 UK airports. Welcoming the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon George Osborne MP, to its new 
European Training Centre today, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary called for a strong "Remain" vote in the European 
Referendum on 23rd June next. Ryanair believes that Britain's economy will be stronger if it remains part of the 
European Union because: This will lead to more UK jobs and stronger economic growth; It will encourage more 
foreign inward investment in the UK of exactly the type that Ryanair has announced today; The EU single market 
has created the low fare air travel revolution which has transformed UK tourism and jobs; Prime Minister Cameron 
has negotiated significant reforms to protect Sterling, limit immigration, and prevent Britain from being dragged into 
closer Union while reducing bureaucracy for British businesses; and UK foreign inward investment will be lost to 
competitor EU member states such as Ireland and Germany if Britain votes to leave the European Union. 
Speaking at London Stansted Airport, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "We are pleased to welcome Chancellor 
Osborne to open our new European Training Centre which now includes 4 flight simulators, a full aircraft interior for 
cabin crew training, and an industry leading full scale engineering training aircraft. These new facilities will allow 
Ryanair to recruit and train over 1,000 pilots, cabin crew and engineers in 2016, and many of these jobs will be 
based across Ryanair's 13 UK based airports, where we are adding 14 new aircraft, and growing our UK traffic from 
36m passengers to 41m passengers in 2016. "It is this type of large scale foreign inward investment that is helping 
to drive the UK economy and job creation. It is exactly this type of investment that will be lost to other competitor EU 
members if the UK votes to leave the European Union. The single market has enabled Ryanair to lead the low fare 
air travel revolution in Europe, as we bring millions of British citizens to Europe each year, and welcome millions of 
European visitors to Britain, and we are calling on everyone to turn out in large numbers and vote "Remain" on the 
23rd June. I am absolutely certain that the UK economy is better off in Europe, and that is why Ryanair is 
Ryanair opens new European training center in London Stansted Airport
campaigning hard and actively calling on UK voters to vote "Remain" on the 23rd June." Charlie Cornish, Chief 
Executive of MAG, owner of London Stansted Airport, said: "I'm delighted Ryanair has chosen London Stansted 
Airport as the base for its new training and engineering facilities, particularly at a time when both businesses are 
seeing significant growth. "Together, London Stansted and Ryanair have been at the forefront of the European air 
travel revolution of the last 20 years. When Ryanair first started flying from London Stansted, passengers had a 
choice of just a dozen EU destinations but this morning they can choose from over 140 EU destinations, more than 
at any other UK airport. As competition has strengthened, airlines have become more efficient, air fares have fallen, 
and choice has increased. By opening up the European travel market to competition, the EU has done far more for 
British consumers and businesses than any government could ever have done acting on its own. "London Stansted 
delivers more European visitors into London than any other airport, generating a significant economic boost to 
London's economy and UK PLC. Leaving the EU would undoubtedly be a huge backward step for UK aviation, a 
sector that employs around 1 million people and supports some of our most successful and innovative industries."

Michael Murray: Ryanair well placed for decent growth

Highlight: Carrier looks in a good place despite intensifying competition and risk of excess capacity
Body
As businesses reach maturity, management often struggle to find profitable new pathways to growth - especially 
when competition is intensifying. A common ‘solution’ to this problem has been for a company to try to sustain 
earnings per share growth by buying back its own shares. But Ryanair’s latest share buyback programme was not 
motivated by lack of growth opportunities. 
Half of the most recent buyback proceeds came from the sale of its minority stake in Aer Lingus, the rest from the 
superior margins and handsome cashflow returns on capital employed being generated by the core business. Its 
share buybacks are being run in parallel with the continued build up of the fleet with – remarkably – no net gearing 
on the balance sheet at present. 
Many Ryanair watchers think, and some (mainly anti-private sector ideologues) hope, that there will be a stop to the 
gallop of this fantastically successful airline and its brash chief executive. But chief executive Michael O’Leary 
exposed more effectively than any other organisation or individual just how massively inefficient the former state-
owned Aer Lingus was, and the huge waste of taxpayers’ funds it engaged in over decades before the late Tony 
Ryan’s low-cost carrier came on the scene and his highly competitive pressure forced change. 
No economy benefited more than Ireland’s from Ryanair’s success, as inward and outbound travel on a large and 
widely affordable scale became a reality, generating huge increases in economic activity. Our rival state airline – 
after 50 years of gross inefficiency and sucking cash from the taxpayer – was forced to shape up. 
Aer Lingus, happily, is no longer owned by the taxpayer, and is no longer listed on the stock market either. Instead 
it has been swallowed up by its former and most effective-ever boss Willie Walsh, now at IAG. Only the Aer Lingus 
brand, legacy aircraft and routes are left, and Ryanair shareholders (by virtue of their former minority stake) have 
benefited handsomely from its sale to IAG. 
Michael Murray: Ryanair well placed for decent growth
While Ryanair continues to excel, elephants don’t gallop. With a market capitalisation of €17.7 billion, it is now three 
times the size of EasyJet, and 15 times the size of Eastern European airline Wizz Air. It is about 25 per cent bigger 
than international airline group IAG, the acquirer of Aer Lingus. 
Having propelled itself from nothing over 35 years to this position, its next growth phase cannot be as it was from 
the much smaller base of even a decade ago – notwithstanding consistently improving its business model and 
leaving no stone unturned for new ways to drive revenue growth, improve customer experience and load factors 
and drive costs out of the business through technology, purchasing power, scale economies, low operating costs 
and a low maintenance cost, fuel-efficient fleet. 
At last week’s results announcement, Michael O’Leary, side by side with his equally formidable chief financial officer 
Neil Sorohan, had plenty to announce in terms of both the short and medium-term outlook – on costs, on revenues, 
on fleet capacity, on marketing initiatives, and on new routes to fuel future growth – much of it to come from the 
emerging markets of Eastern Europe where Wizz Air is the main, but much smaller competitor, in the low-cost 
space. 
So here are the essential elements of the recent initiatives and the business plan that is intended to underpin the 
company’s medium-term growth prospects and with it the share price – which doesn’t look rich relative either to last 
year’s earnings, prospective earnings, or stock market ratings as a whole. 
1.  Its access to new airports: Ryanair continues to open new routes across Europe and retains ambitious growth 
plans, in particular through new emerging Eastern European routes. 
2.  Increasing penetration of main airports: Historically, Ryanair was confined to many peripheral airports at a good 
distance from the major cities. This limited its appeal to the business traveller where travel time from airport to city 
centre was a key driver of choice. But as Ryanair continues to penetrate the main ‘nearer-to-city’ airports, its appeal 
to the higher margin business traveller rises and the revenue from that market segment should rise with it. 
3.  Its increased market segmentation, facilitated by that rising proportion of business travellers, is also now a driver 
of new ancillary earnings – from options on premium seat choice, on priority boarding, and other mainly technology-
driven revenue enhancers made more accessible to the customer through the new Ryanair apps, with car and hotel 
bookings easily executed along with flights and boarding passes. This is driving ancillary revenues as well as 
facilitating more efficient targeted marketing at lower cost. 
4.  Its fleet acquisition programme will increase the fleet numbers by 16 per cent and deliver a step change in 
performance in cost and scale economies. More fuel efficient consumption and seating capacity rising from the 
current 189 per aircraft in the existing core fleet to 197 seats in the new, will spread both the lower fixed and 
variable operating costs over a larger passenger base. However, caution is needed here. Competitors also have 
significant orders for new capacity over the next six years. If deliveries coincide with a downturn in what is after all a 
cyclical industry, load factors, pricing power and earnings could suffer significantly. That said, Ryanair’s financial 
strength and cost advantages over rivals should leave the company nicely placed to squeeze some of the 
competition out. 
5.  Its oil price hedging: Ryanair’s recent trading performance has to be viewed in the context of unfavourable fuel 
hedging relative to competitors. Fuel was hedged over the last 12 months at $90 per barrel, but is now 95 per cent 
hedged at $62, and 44 per cent hedged to full year 2018 at $50. Savings of $360 million from the hedging 
programme are estimated in total. 
     On all other metrics, Ryanair continued to improve its cost performance relative to the competition and to 
achieve meaningfully higher load factors (around 93 per cent versus below 90 per cent or lower for the competition). 
Last year, costs per seat fell by 2 per cent (excluding fuel), beating the competition. Now that the unfavourable fuel 
price hedges have substantially run their course, the new forward hedged fuel prices for 2017 and 2018 and the 
dollar aircraft purchases hedged at $1.31 are set to deliver substantial cost savings relative to recent years. 
Michael Murray: Ryanair well placed for decent growth
6.  An ungeared balance sheet on a net basis and long-term fixed rate bonds provides cheap funding over the 
medium to long term. The balance sheet muscle will be critical in the event of a downturn in the industry (induced 
perhaps by a combination of excess capacity from new fleet deliveries across the sector coinciding with a slowdown 
in macroeconomic growth). 
7.  The company’s ‘always getting better’ programme is broadening its appeal beyond the cost-conscious traveller 
in terms of airport accessibility, segmented business customer offerings, winning metrics in on-time arrivals and the 
lowest lost baggage figures of all the European airlines. The rise of the business traveller on Ryanair, aside from 
boosting overall margins is also important for driving growth in ancillary revenues and increased access to main city 
airports should continue to be a growth driver as well as the company’s plans for many more route openings in 
Eastern Europe. 
8.  Ryanair’s management team is proven in terms of its experience and success with a strong corporate culture in 
keeping with the no nonsense ethos of its chief executive. 
While there are all of these positives, the company is not understating the risks. Fare reductions this year are 
estimated at 7 per cent in an endeavour to sustain load factors at the market beating 93 per cent. But with fuel costs 
now substantially down from the elevated hedged levels, the company has guided a post tax earnings rise of 13 per 
cent, notwithstanding the fare reductions. However, it acknowledges that disruption by air traffic controllers or a 
repeat of terrorist attacks could upset this guidance. 
Ryanair’s financial strength and market power are a significant comfort and I see its current modest low teens price 
earnings ratio as a potentially attractive level at which to top up my currently modest holding. But I will wait to see 
how the French air traffic controllers behave in coming weeks before jumping in.

Low fuel costs and higher volumes lift Wizz Air Airlines
Low fuel costs and higher volumes lift Wizz Air; Airlines

Low fuel costs and increased volumes lifted profits at Wizz Air to record levels as the company forecast further rises 
in profit in 2017 despite heightened price competition.
The UK-listed Hungarian airline yesterday reported adjusted net profit for the year ending in March at EUR224m, up 
53 per cent from the previous year, and ahead of the company's March forecast of EUR200m-EUR210m.
The airline's profit measure excludes currency moves and exceptional items.
The airline carried a record 20m passengers - a 21 per cent rise - while revenue rose 16 per cent to EUR1.43bn. 
Earnings were lifted by lower fuel prices and increased volumes.
Jozsef Varadi , Wizz Air founder and chief executive, pledged that the company would do "whatever it takes" to 
remain competitive on pricing as the airline faced a period of increased competition with Ryanair, which also 
reported increased profits this week.
Wizz Air's Dublin-based rival, which carried more than 100m passengers in the last year, is planning to base a 
further nine aircraft in central and eastern Europe this year, foreshadowing an increased race to capture the 
region's 300m consumers.
Low fuel costs and higher volumes lift Wizz Air Airlines
Mr Varadi said the airline had matched Ryanair on costs. "Whatever the market demands to remain competitive, we 
will do it. Our unit costs will decline by 5 per cent thanks to lower fuel prices and flat unit costs."
The carrier is one of the fastest-growing members of a breed of low-cost airlines like Norwegian, which are offering 
greater competition to legacy carriers and Ryanair.
The company floated on the London Stock Exchange at the start of 2015, with an initial price of £14.50 per share. 
The shares were trading at £19.91 by early afternoon yesterday.
The carrier has set a profit target range of between EUR245m and EUR255m for the year to March 2017, although 
it added that the guidance was "heavily caveated" by how it performed in the second half.
Analysts said the airline's stronger than expected revenue performance in Q4 2016 suggested that profit guidance 
for 2017 was conservative. But they warned that Wizz faced several risks, including the possibility that Britain would 
leave the European Union.

BUDGET airline Ryanair missed expectations in its full-year profits yesterday, as the impact of terrorist attacks on 
bookings and low oil prices began to take their toll.
But the no-frills carrier said it will respond by cutting fares by seven per cent, adjusting to a market in which lower 
airfare prices are required in an era of unrelentingly cheap oil.
Rival airlines including British Airways owner International Airlines Group have warned of increasing competition on 
airfares to ensure flights stay full.
Ryanair's adjusted net profits came in at (EURO)1.24bn (£961m) for the 52 weeks to 31 March, a 43 per cent 
increase on the previous year, although this missed analysts' estimate of (EURO)1.3bn. However, the company's 
results were in line with its own forecasts.
Revenue was up 16 per cent at (EURO)6.54bn, which was marginally below analysts' forecasts of (EURO)6.55bn.
Ryanair said its Easter bookings had been adversely impacted by more than 500 flight cancellations following the 
Brussels terrorists attack and repeated, mostly French, traffic controller strikes.
The airline has warned its first quarter yields will also be hit negatively by cancellations, lower airfares, the early 
Easter and sterling weakness in the run up to the referendum in June.

TOURISM is one of our biggest exports - and London is the most-visited city on earth. But the industry is worried 
that this world-beating ranking could be at risk if Britain cuts itself off from Europe.
In fact, Europe is our biggest tourist market, with more than 60 per cent of visitors to the UK coming from the EU. 
Nearly three-quarters of business visitors come from the continent. So anything that encourages those visitors to 
think of other destinations is a concern for London's hotels, flagship stores and attractions.
Of course, we'll still be physically in the same location. The appeal of the capital's iconic sights, unparalleled 
heritage and vibrant West End would still exist. So why should EU status matter? In short, the EU has enabled 
lowcost, low-hassle travel. This has boosted the income generated from tourists travelling to London, and enabled 
British tourism firms to sell more not just to Brits but to the whole of Europe. Brexit would hurt the domestic tourism 
industry and our global tourism brands because it would, over time, increase friction - creating annoyances and 
costs (such as new visa requirements) that would make travel less appealing, and constrain access for UK 
businesses. Take air travel. Without the work of the EU, cheap flights across Europe would never have happened. 
The EU's liberalisation of Europe's airspace has led to the rapid growth of lowcost airlines - including UK companies 
like EasyJet, but also those like Ryanair which have put London at the heart of their networks.
These low-cost flights have fuelled British businesses' expansions, making it more affordable for smaller firms to 
visit prospective continental customers. They have also brought Europe to London, underpinning the £9.6bn spent 
in the UK by EU tourists every year.
Brexit threatens London's world beating tourism industry: Don't let the capital become a museum
A similar Open Skies deal with the US is only beginning to realise its potential. When further liberalisation between 
the EU and the rest of the world occurs, do we want to be part of that deal, or find ourselves excluded? There's 
another hit the tourism industry would face. Outside the EU, we'd see downward pressure on disposable incomes 
as the UK economy struggles with the consequences of Brexit - putting expenditure on nonessential leisure travel at 
risk, as well as impacting London's high value business travel market.
Meanwhile, the protectionist, antiimmigration rhetoric of Brexit campaigners shows we could face draconian and 
economically illiterate restrictions on workers from outside the UK. This would be horrendous for hotels and 
attractions at peak times of year.
Tourism has been able to grow so rapidly, and contribute so much in tax revenues and jobs for British workers, 
because the industry has also had access to a huge pool of European hospitality talent and can hire people to meet 
seasonal demand or fill skilled vacancies. This is a difficult argument to make in public, but it has the merit of being 
true. It's also worth bearing in mind that plenty of young Londoners gain experience by working in the Med's tourism 
resorts.
Finally, there is a real danger that lucrative business travel to London could fall into long-term decline. That's 
because the capital is currently the place global businesses want to put either their global or European 
headquarters. Outside the EU, we would start to see businesses locate their HQs in Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam. 
This would result in less investment in hotels, retail and attractions in London - and we'd see British workers losing 
their jobs.
Access to Europe has made London a world leader in business travel, flight networks, and global brands as well as 
tourist spending. London will always be a great historic city. We mustn't let it become a museum.

Highlight: O'Leary comments set to intensify pressure on higher-cost legacy carriers
Body
The crash of an EgyptAir jet killing 66 people last week will help drive down fares this summer as airlines try to lure 
passengers with price cuts, according to Michael O'Leary , chief executive of the low-cost carrier Ryanair.
"Regardless of the outcome of the investigation into EgyptAir . . . it will mean lower prices through the June quarter 
and probably into the September quarter," he said.
Terrorist attacks "tend to hit our pricing over the next three to five months".
This summer prices could fall 2-3 per cent, he said, though some of the reduction was also due to the benefits of 
lower fuel costs being passed on to customers.
Mr O'Leary also said that Ryanair's push across Europe would contribute to a 7 per cent fall in prices this year.
The Ryanair boss's comments are likely to step up the pressure on higher-cost legacy carriers. Air France-KLM, 
Lufthansa, British Airways and Iberia have all either cut back on certain routes or voiced concerns over a glut of 
capacity this summer.
But Mr O'Leary insisted that Ryanair would expand its offering and pass on to customers the savings made by the 
arrival of more fuel-efficient, aircraft.
Ryanair expects reduced fares after EgyptAir crash Airlines
"We are shovelling loads of capacity into their markets where [the legacy airlines] are not able to compete on 
costs," Mr O'Leary said.
Yet even Ryanair appears to be curtailing its ambitions for expansion.
Capacity growth for the year to the end of March 2017 is expected to halve to 9 per cent. Europe's biggest low-cost 
airline indicated that net profits in 2017 would come in between EUR1.38bn and EUR1.43bn - slightly below 
consensus forecasts of EUR1.47bn.
Mr O'Leary insisted that the slowdown would not affect Ryanair's ability to continue cutting fares. The group's new 
Boeing 737 single-aisle jets would raise seating capacity 4 per cent and save 16 per cent on fuel cost per 
passenger.
"We will grow the fleet from 341 aircraft last year to almost 550 by 2024," he said. "That underwrites our ability to 
lower airfares for every one of the next eight years. We are putting more pressure on competition out there."
Nevertheless, analysts warned that this could be a difficult year for airlines in Europe struggling with repeated 
strikes, despite lower fuel prices.
"Summer 2017, especially the second quarter, faces significant capacity [over]supply in the European market," said 
Damian Brewer of RBC Capital Markets.
On top of that, bookings have been hurt by terror attacks in Belgium and Paris at a time when carriers are 
expanding capacity with new aircraft. Iata, the industry group, noted this month that capacity growth had exceeded 
passenger traffic in February and March this year. Concerns are mounting that airlines may be expanding too 
quickly into a market that is growing at a slower rate.
"Faster capacity growth is the inevitable consequence of cheaper fuel," said Gerald Khoo, transport analyst at 
Liberum. "Lower costs encourage airlines to add more capacity, or cut less, than they would otherwise have done. 
This puts downward pressure on pricing, which will inevitably result in financially weaker airlines having to 
eventually revise their plans."
Ryanair said annual profits after tax increased 43 per cent, to EUR1.24bn, in the year to the end of March. Revenue 
was EUR6.54bn, up 16 per cent on the year and just below analysts' forecasts of EUR6.55bn.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair continued to rein in costs, with more than half of its 2018 fuel costs already hedged at $50 
a barrel. Senior and middle management had also agreed to a pay freeze for 12 months, while pilots and cabin 
crew had agreed a five-year productivity plan.
"There was evidence of non-fuel unit costs coming under control, suggesting that the 1 per cent reduction target for 
this year may be credible," said Mr Khoo.
Ryanair's net profits were helped by a EUR398m gain on the sale of its stake in Aer Lingus to International Airlines 
Group, owner of British Airways and Iberia.
Ryanair said it was "actively campaigning" for Britain to remain in the EU. "Ryanair strongly believes that the UK 
economy and its future growth prospects are stronger if it remains a member of the European Union."
Mr O'Leary warned last week that the group would cut back on investment in Britain if the UK left the single market.

PRIME Minister David Cameron will today highlight the potential increase in travel costs if Britain were to leave the 
European Union.
Cameron, who will be seen standing in front of a plane with EasyJet boss Carolyn McCall, is set to discuss the 
Treasury's recent warn-ing that Brexit would make Britain poorer by the equivalent of £4,300 per household by 
2030 and every year thereafter. The report also warned that a vote to leave would push the UK economy into a 
recession and lead to an increase in unemployment of around 500,000.
Cameron is set to warn that an exit from the EU would lead to the pound depreciating, resulting in the cost of travel 
rising.
Last week, chancellor George Osborne joined Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary to take a stand against Brexit.

DUBLIN (AP) - European budget carrier Ryanair has posted record full-year profits and passenger figures, and 
expects both to hit new highs this summer amid rapid growth and declining fares.
Monday's results for the year ending March 31 showed the Dublin-based airline strengthening on every front. Net 
profit before exceptional gains rose 43 percent to 1.24 billion euros ($1.4 billion) and the percentage of seats sold 
rose 5 points to 93 percent. Total sales rose 16 percent to 6.54 billion euros and the overall number of passengers 
for the year rose 18 percent to 106.4 million.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary says Ryanair expects average fares to fall around 6 percent this summer and 
even more in winter amid increased competition and well-hedged fuel costs. He says Ryanair should carry 116 
million passengers and record a minimum net profit in 2017 of 1.38 billion euros, 11 percent higher than Monday's 
record figure. Analysts expect Ryanair to beat that forecast by at least 100 million euros.
O'Leary said Ryanair foresees its fleet of Boeing 737-800s growing this year by 53 aircraft to reach 380 as the 
airline expands eastward with seven new bases including Bucharest, Romania; Prague, Czech Republic; Sofia, 
Bulgaria, and the German cities of Hamburg and Nuremberg. Ryanair already is central to western Europe's short-
haul traffic with the biggest market share in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain. It's No. 3 in Germany and 
France and No. 2 in Britain where it's battling to dethrone budget rival easyJet.
Ryanair shares rose 2.4 percent in afternoon Dublin trading to 13.53 euros.
Monday's net profit excluded an exceptional gain of 317.5 million euros from Ryanair's November sale of its stake in 
rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus to IAG, the parent of British Airways. Ryanair launched three hostile bids for Aer Lingus 
that faced opposition from competition regulators, the Irish government and labor unions.
Analysts credit Ryanair's 2013 decision to start improving customer service and broadening its product range as 
critical in driving its latest growth. A business previously infamous for surprise extra charges and cut-throat 
inflexibility now offers smoother online sales, family and business tickets, more relaxed baggage rules and better 
space on its new Boeing models.

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Irish no-frills airline Ryanair (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported Monday that its fiscal 2016 profit 
before tax grew 43 percent to 1.72 billion euros from 982.4 million euros last year. Earnings per share were 115.63 
euros, higher than 62.46 euros last year. 
 The latest results included exceptional accounting gain of 317.5 million euros on sale of Aer Lingus shareholding.  
Adjusted pre-tax profit was 1.40 billion euros and adjusted attributable profit was 1.24 billion euros or 92.08 euros 
per share.  Revenues for the year climbed 16 percent to 6.54 billion euros from 5.65 billion euros a year ago. 
Scheduled revenues grew 17 percent and Ancillary revenues grew 13 percent.  Traffic went up 18 percent to 106.4 
million customers as load factor grew 5 percent to 93 percent.   Unit costs fell 6 percent, while it was down 2 
percent ex-fuel. Average fare dropped 1 percent.  The company noted that the fourth quarter yields on close-in 
Easter bookings were adversely impacted by over 500 flight cancellations following the Brussels terrorist attacks 
and repeated (mainly French) ATC strikes.  Looking ahead, the company said it cautiously expects full year net 
profit to rise modestly, by approximately 13 percent, to a range of 1.375 billion euros to 1.425 billion euros.  This 
guidance remains heavily dependent on the strength of close-in summer bookings and next winter's yields, the 
strength of Sterling and the absence of any further external shocks or significant ATC strikes/cancellations.

Irish low-cost giant Ryanair plans to cut fares sharply in coming months, but said it expects to boost profit by 
boosting its share of an increasingly competitive European short-haul market.
The airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, outlined the planned cut to fares on Monday as it reported net 
profit of 1.24 billion euros (dollar 1.39 billion) for the year ended March 2016, an increase of 43 percent on the 
previous year.
Fares will fall by an average of 7 percent in its current financial year, which ends on March 31, with fares falling by 
between 10 and 12 percent in the winter months, chief executive Michael O'Leary said.
"If there is a fare war in Europe, then Ryanair will be the winner," he said in a video presentation. Ryanair expects 
to carry 116 million passengers in the year to March, an annual increase of 9 percent. Ryanair said in a statement it 
"cautiously" expected net profit to increase by approximately 13 percent in the year to March 2017, to between 1.38 
billion euros and 1.43 billion euros, less than the consensus of 1.47 billion in a poll of over 10 analysts compiled by 
the company ahead of the results. Rivals including British Airways-owner IAG, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM have 
warned recently about increasing capacity in the sector and the impact on tourism from militant attacks in Paris and 
Brussels. easyJet earlier this month said strong demand for beach holidays was making up for a drop in travelling in 
the wake of the attacks. Ryanair shares closed Friday up 20 percent compared to a year ago at 13.16 euros, while 
the Thomson Reuters European Airline Index was down 3 percent. Ryanair shares have fallen 12 percent since the 
start of the year, in line with the index.(Reuters) Source: www.businessworld.ie

       VIENNA (dpa-AFX) - The European markets ended the first session of the new trading week with modest 
losses. The markets briefly turned positive this morning, but traded in negative territory for the majority of the 
session. The European markets logged their largest increase in a month at the end of the previous week, leading 
investors to take some profits.  Traders were disappointed by the unexpected decrease in Eurozone private sector 
data Monday. 
Commodity prices also struggled at the start of the week, as the U.S. dollar strengthened.   The risks of a de-
anchoring of inflation expectations to below 1 percent or close to zero in the euro area have increased and hence, 
the central bank acted forcefully, ECB Executive Board member Peter Praet said in an interview to a newspaper, 
published Monday.   'We have seen in some countries some signs of de-anchoring in wage formation, Praet said in 
an interview with the Portuguese daily Publico.   'But, this being said, we haven't concluded that inflation 
expectations are de-anchored.'  The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks decreased 0.99 percent, 
while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, lost 0.46 percent.  The DAX of 
Germany dropped 0.74 percent and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.66 percent. The FTSE 100 of the U.K. declined 
0.14 percent and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.51 percent.  In Frankfurt, pharmaceutical and 
chemicals giant Bayer fell 5.72 percent after making an all-cash offer to acquire U.S. agrochemicals firm Monsanto 
Co. for $62 billion.  Nordex lost 1.66 percent despite reporting a rise in Q1 profit and sales.  Aixtron soared 16.21 
percent. China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund LP said it would make a voluntary public takeover offer to buy 
the German semiconductor equipment maker for about 670 million euros ($752 million), including net cash.  
Daimler dropped 1.57 percent and BMW weakened by 0.93 percent. Volkswagen also slipped 0.58 percent.  In 
Paris, Peugeot surrendered 1.06 percent and Renault lost 1.14 percent.   In London, Inmarsat decreased 4.04 
percent after Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating on the stock to 'Equal weight' from 'Overweight.'  RBC Capital 
Markets upgraded its rating on shares of Royal Mail to 'Sector perform' from 'Underperform.' The stock finished 
higher by 4.29 percent.  Ryanair climbed 2.09 percent. The company's full year earnings per share were 115.63 
euros, higher than 62.46 euros last year.  Novartis increased 2.60 percent in Zurich after new guidelines on the 
treatment of heart failure strongly endorsed the use of its drug Entresto.  Richemont declined 3.48 percent, after it 
was downgraded by JPMorgan and Citigroup.  Insurer Aegon dropped 1.13 percent in Amsterdam after announcing 
European Markets Weakened At The Start Of The New Week
the sale of GBP 3 billion annuity liabilities to Legal & General.  Fiat Chrysler fell 4.44 percent in Milan on a report 
that the carmaker has used illegal software to manipulate pollution emissions of its vehicles.  Eurozone consumer 
confidence improved for a second straight month and at a faster-than-expected pace in May to its highest level in 
four months, preliminary data from the European Commission showed Monday.  The flash consumer confidence 
index climbed to -7 from -9.3 in April. Economists had forecast a score of 9 for the month.   Eurozone private sector 
growth weakened to the lowest level in more than a year in May as improvements in Germany and France were 
offset by softening of activity outside the big-two economies. The flash composite output index fell unexpectedly to 
a 16-month low of 52.9 from 53 in April, the results of the Purchasing Managers' Survey by Markit Economics 
revealed Monday. The index was forecast to rise to 53.2.  Germany's private sector activity expanded at a faster 
pace in May, flash survey results from Markit showed Monday. The composite output index rose to a 5-month high 
of 54.7 in May from 53.6 in April.  The French private sector growth improved to a 7-month high in May, flash survey 
data from Markit showed Monday. The composite output index rose to 51.1 in May, a 7-month high, from 50.2 in 
April.  British exporters logged a moderate growth in the first quarter, the latest Quarterly International Trade 
Outlook from the British Chambers of Commerce and DHL showed Sunday. The trade confidence index increased 
by 1.4 percent sequentially to 116.04 in the first quarter. However, it dropped 4.4 percent from the prior year.

percent, to a range of 1.375 billion euros to 1.425 billion euros.
This guidance remains heavily dependent on the strength of close-in summer bookings and next winter's yields, the 
strength of Sterling and the absence of any further external shocks or significant ATC strikes/cancellations.

(RTTNews) - The European markets ended the first session of the new trading week with modest losses. The 
markets briefly turned positive this morning, but traded in negative territory for the majority of the session. The 
European markets logged their largest increase in a month at the end of the previous week, leading investors to 
take some profits.
Traders were disappointed by the unexpected decrease in Eurozone private sector data Monday. Commodity prices 
also struggled at the start of the week, as the U.S. dollar strengthened.
The risks of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations to below 1 percent or close to zero in the euro area have 
increased and hence, the central bank acted forcefully, ECB Executive Board member Peter Praet said in an 
interview to a newspaper, published Monday.
"We have seen in some countries some signs of de-anchoring in wage formation, Praet said in an interview with the 
Portuguese daily Publico.
"But, this being said, we haven't concluded that inflation expectations are de-anchored."
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks decreased 0.99 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, lost 0.46 percent.
The DAX of Germany dropped 0.74 percent and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.66 percent. The FTSE 100 of the U.K. 
declined 0.14 percent and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.51 percent.
In Frankfurt, pharmaceutical and chemicals giant Bayer fell 5.72 percent after making an all-cash offer to acquire 
U.S. agrochemicals firm Monsanto Co. for $62 billion.
Nordex lost 1.66 percent despite reporting a rise in Q1 profit and sales.
Aixtron soared 16.21 percent. China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund LP said it would make a voluntary public 
takeover offer to buy the German semiconductor equipment maker for about 670 million euros ($752 million), 
including net cash.
Daimler dropped 1.57 percent and BMW weakened by 0.93 percent. Volkswagen also slipped 0.58 percent.
European Markets Weakened At The Start Of The New Week
In Paris, Peugeot surrendered 1.06 percent and Renault lost 1.14 percent. In London, Inmarsat decreased 4.04 
percent after Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating on the stock to "Equal weight" from "Overweight."
RBC Capital Markets upgraded its rating on shares of Royal Mail to "Sector perform" from "Underperform." The 
stock finished higher by 4.29 percent.
Ryanair climbed 2.09 percent. The company's full year earnings per share were 115.63 euros, higher than 62.46 
euros last year.
Novartis increased 2.60 percent in Zurich after new guidelines on the treatment of heart failure strongly endorsed 
the use of its drug Entresto.
Richemont declined 3.48 percent, after it was downgraded by JPMorgan and Citigroup.
Insurer Aegon dropped 1.13 percent in Amsterdam after announcing the sale of GBP 3 billion annuity liabilities to 
Legal & General.
Fiat Chrysler fell 4.44 percent in Milan on a report that the carmaker has used illegal software to manipulate 
pollution emissions of its vehicles.
Eurozone consumer confidence improved for a second straight month and at a faster-than-expected pace in May to 
its highest level in four months, preliminary data from the European Commission showed Monday. The flash 
consumer confidence index climbed to -7 from -9.3 in April. Economists had forecast a score of 9 for the month.
Eurozone private sector growth weakened to the lowest level in more than a year in May as improvements in 
Germany and France were offset by softening of activity outside the big-two economies. The flash composite output 
index fell unexpectedly to a 16-month low of 52.9 from 53 in April, the results of the Purchasing Managers' Survey 
by Markit Economics revealed Monday. The index was forecast to rise to 53.2.
Germany's private sector activity expanded at a faster pace in May, flash survey results from Markit showed 
Monday. The composite output index rose to a 5-month high of 54.7 in May from 53.6 in April.
The French private sector growth improved to a 7-month high in May, flash survey data from Markit showed 
Monday. The composite output index rose to 51.1 in May, a 7-month high, from 50.2 in April.
British exporters logged a moderate growth in the first quarter, the latest Quarterly International Trade Outlook from 
the British Chambers of Commerce and DHL showed Sunday. The trade confidence index increased by 1.4 percent 
sequentially to 116.04 in the first quarter. However, it dropped 4.4 percent from the prior year.

TODAY 23
Ryanair is not only one of the world's biggest airlines; it is also one of the most hyperactive.
In the past 12 months it has raised its guidance on full-year 2015 to between EUR1.18bn and EUR1.23bn, 
announced an EUR800m share buyback, launched a private corporate-jet scheme and begun legal action over 
another website's allegedly misleading advertisements for its flights.
Today investors will get a chance to see how all these initiatives and announcements are reflected in the low-fare 
airline's profits.
Moreover they will want to see how chief executive Michael O'Leary intends to keep the growth momentum going, 
given the clouds on the horizon after the terrorist attack on Brussels airport, an important base for Ryanair, weaker 
sterling, and the possible end of low oil prices.
As analysts at Davy stockbrokers in Dublin put it in a results preview note for investors: "Guidance is key." Vincent

Hewlett-Packard , the maker of printers and personal computers, is expected to show a continued slide in 
revenues when it announces earnings.
The company, founded in Silicon Valley in 1939, recently split its hardware and enterprise businesses into two listed 
companies, in an attempt to help each achieve growth.
However, amid a broad contraction in printer and laptop sales, analysts expect that HP's revenues will have fallen 
to $11.7bn in the fiscal second quarter, 9 per cent lower than a year ago.
The company is looking to areas outside its core markets for eventual growth, including copiers and 3D printing.
HP released its first commercial 3D printers this month, with two models specifically aimed at manufacturing clients.
The devices, one of which costs $130,000 and will ship this year, can print linked parts out of a hard plastic 
material, at 10 times the speed of other printers.
Nike, BMW and Johnson & Johnson are among companies that are testing the commercial printer. If successful 
such devices could usher in a new style of printer-based manufacturing.
However, analysts do not expect 3D printer sales to have a meaningful impact on HP revenues this year or next.

Investors watch how M&S shapes up with non-food sales
Investors will be hoping that new chief executive Steve Rowe can put a stop to Marks and Spencer 's tumbling 
clothing and homeware sales as the high-street stalwart reports full-year results on Wednesday .
Shares in M&S have fallen 24 per cent in the past year as the retailer struggles to arrest falling sales in the non-
food part of its business, with like-for-like sales down 13 per cent in five years.
Mr Rowe is expected to announce a strategic review for the clothing and home division alongside annual financial 
results.
"We expect . . . a similar approach to that applied in food - a relentless focus on driving top line like-for-like via 
volume sales growth," said analysts at HSBC.
"This is a change in strategy to that of Marc Bolland, whose tenure was characterised by a significant period of 
infrastructure investment, and where against a challenging market backdrop improvements in the financial 
performance of the business were gross margin and cost led."
Mr Rowe blasted last quarter's 2.7 per cent drop in general merchandise sales as "not good enough" and said: "We 
have not been a stylish as we need to be. We've not had the right products in the right place. There's a lot more to 
do."
Corporate diary: May 23 - May 27
He added, however, that there remained "an awful lot of self-help we can do", thanks to heavy investment in 
product design, warehousing and online infrastructure in the years before his appointment.
M&S's results have long been a tale of two businesses, with its food division popular among Britain's middle 
classes, while clothing and homeware have struggled.
Revenues are forecast to inch up from £10.3bn to £10.4bn, while pre-tax profits rise 1.4 per cent from £661m to 
£670m. Paul McClean

If ever a company should know how to stay under the radar it is Qinetiq . The company - spun out of the Ministry of 
Defence a decade ago - is responsible for sensitive defence technology research, testing and consultancy.
Qinetiq is the biggest non-US partner to the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and is an important 
UK supplier. While secrecy makes publicising what Qinetiq does a little harder than for most companies, there is not 
likely to be too much cloak and dagger about its annual results.
In fact there should be little to surprise. At a trading statement issued at the end of March Qinetiq confirmed that it 
was on course to deliver on expectations for the year.
However, some questions may need to be answered this year and next. In March the MoD announced that the 
allowed profit rate for single source contracts would be cut from 10.6 to 8.95 per cent.
Investors will want to know what the impact will be on Qinetiq as it seeks to reorganise its wide array of businesses 
under a relatively new chief executive. About a third of group revenues are potentially exposed to the rate cut.
They will also be keen to hear Steve Wadey 's strategic vision now that he has been in post for a year.
Analysts at Canaccord Genuity suspect a wave of acquisition ahead, as well as organic investment, to drive the top 
line as margins fall.
They forecast a slight fall in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation from £135.6m to £131.2m 
for the year to March 31. Peggy Hollinger
United Utilities will tell the market next week how it has fared under the first year of tougher price controls imposed 
by the regulator.
The water company will announce its full-year results, with analysts predicting slightly higher profits than for the 
previous year.
In March United said it expected to make slightly higher revenues than 2014-15 as an increase in sales in the non-
regulated parts of the business made up for tighter price controls.
The company has benefited from lower finance costs, but as it said net debt would rise slightly as it spent on 
maintaining and renewing its infrastructure.
In 2014-15 United made £341.6m in pre-tax profits. Analysts expect that to have risen to £386.8m for 2015-16.
Investors will want to hear how proposed changes to the highly regulated water market, including a government 
push for more competition, will affect United Utilities in future. Kiran Stacey

       LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Strong passenger growth, fuller planes and low fuel costs helped Europe's largest low-
cost airline, Ryanair, record a 43-per-cent jump in its annual profit, the airline said on Monday.  Ryanair promised to 
cut passenger fares this year after its post-tax profit soared to 1.24 billion euros (1.39 billion dollars) in the financial 
year to March 31, spurred by rises of 18 per cent in passengers and 16 per cent in revenue.  The airline had 
'delivered significant traffic and profit growth in all four quarters,' Ryanair owner Michael O'Leary said, adding that it 
had attracted 'millions of new customers.'  Ryanair said it flights operated at an average of 93 per cent of capacity 
and should remain at a similar level this year, while passenger numbers are expected to grow by another 9 per cent 
to 116 million in its new financial year.  It expects to reduce average fares by about 7 per cent this year and 
forecasts a 13-per-cent rise in net profit to between 1.38 billion and 1.43 billion euros.   Copyright dpa

Datalex strikes deal with IBM
Travel software company Datalex has announced a collaboration with tech giant IBM.In a statement issued 
to the Irish Stock Exchange last week, Datalex said it had reached an agreement with IBM to “collaborate in 
the development and delivery of joint travel retail solutions in digital commerce, cognitive computing, 
analytics, data and cloud services”.Datalex, which counts Aer Lingus, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic 
among its clients, will hold its agm in Dublin on Tuesday.The company is also due to publish an interim 
management statement that day.
Profits jump at DCC
DCC has reported a 35.5 per cent rise in full-year operating profit to £300.5 million, driven by the performance of its 
energy division following the acquisition of Butagaz and Esso Retail, the company’s biggest acquisitions to date. 
The sales, marketing, distribution and business support services group also signalled further growth ahead. “The 
group expects that the year ending March 31, 2017 will be another year of profit growth and development,” it said in 
a statement. 
Meanwhile, last week also saw some board changes at DCC. Cormac McCarthy, the former Paddy Power chief 
financial officer, has joined its board as a non-executive director. 
DCC also announced that the deputy chairman of its board, David Byrne, intends to retire from the board after the 
company’s upcoming agm on July 15.
Revenue boost for Newry firm
Revenue at financial software firm First Derivatives rose by 41 per cent to £117 million in the year to the end of 
February. 
Boardroom Briefing
The Newry-based firm announced last week that its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation rose by 51 per cent to £23.3 million during the same period. Profit before tax, adjusted for factors such 
as a once-off disposal gain last year, rose by 56 per cent to £16.8 million. 
“We expect another year of strong growth, at least in line with market forecasts, while continuing to invest for growth 
in the future,” chairman Seamus Keating said. 
Ryanair unveils new routes
Ryanair has announced its first Luxembourg flights, with two new routes to London Stansted and Porto starting from 
September. 
According to figures from the airline, its new routes will deliver 200,000 customers annually at Luxembourg Airport. 
The airline will publish its full year results tomorrow. 
Non-executive appointment at IFG
IFG appointed a new non-executive director to its board last week. Kathryn Purves joined the board of the Dublin-
listed financial services company with effect from May 17. 
“Kathryn is an experienced financial services executive bringing a breadth of functional experience having worked 
across investment, commercial, legal and more recently risk management, where she has been chief risk officer of 
Partnership Life Insurance, the FTSE small-cap life insurance company,” IFG said in a statement. 
Earlier this month, IFG said thatc it was trading in line with expectations for 2016 so far, with revenues and profits 
ahead of the same period in 2015. 
The week ahead
In addition to Ryanair’s results tomorrow and Datalex’s agm on Tuesday (see above), there’s a few other things to 
keep an eye on in the coming days. 
On Tuesday, AIB will publish a trading statement. That day will also see property investment firm Hibernia Reit 
publish its results for the year to the end of March.

Highlight: It is important to carry out due diligence on companies you are interested in putting your money into
Body
The lifetime investor who doesn’t suffer losses from the risks inherent in stock market investing almost certainly 
hasn’t been born. The best we can do is to be as thorough in due diligence as possible. 
When looking at a prospective investment, one rarely finds the answers in the numbers alone. 
Yes, they are important. But it is the future sustainability of the business model, the company’s market position, its 
management experience and calibre, regulatory environment and the macroeconomic environment and outlook 
(and the earnings growth capacity that flows from these things) that matters from the perspective of the investor 
seeking to form a view on the sustainability of dividend payments, capital accretion and hence share price 
prospects. 
When I look for the growth drivers and their sustainability I look at the following key issues:
1.The company’s market position: is it strong and sustainable and what makes it such? 
2.Technological capability: does it have patented proprietary technology? 
3.Does it have a storehouse of expertise and experience in specialist niches that would be difficult for a competitor 
to easily replicate and that therefore enjoys some pricing power? 
4.Does it have a price advantage driven by economies of scale? 
5.Does it have a strong brand (or a portfolio of brands) which enjoys high levels of trust, built up in the consumer’s 
mind over decades, and that delivers the margins that come with the scale economies and strength of brand equity 
(Colgate Palmolive, Nestlé, Coca-Cola, or Diageo)? 
Invested: 15 questions to ask when investing
6.What is the strength and prospective strength and growth dynamics of the geographic markets into which the 
business sells and operates, how geographically diversified are those markets, and how much untapped market 
opportunity remains? 
7. Do its margins – relative to others in the sector – point to operational excellence, efficiency and market 
leadership in its segment? 
8.Can it finance more capacity to drive further growth (for example, Ryanair) or is its balance sheet already 
stretched? 
9.Is there a collaborative element in the nature of its relationship with customers in new product development and 
the quality of its research and innovation capability which gives it pricing power (Kerry Group)? 
10.Is it a market leader in a consolidating industry with a strong track record and reputation for delivery, and a 
disciplined approach to achieving shareholder accretive returns on capital when judging acquisition opportunities 
and the price to pay? 
Does it have a clear track record on acquisitions in terms of delivering on cost savings and returns on capital 
invested (DCC)? 
11.Is it a market disrupter with a technology-driven cost advantage over incumbents (Amazon)? 
12.Having satisfied myself on the sources of competitive advantage, I look at other factors: the numbers. In 
particular, the company’s balance sheet composition and strength. 
While there is no simple guideline for determining the ideal balance sheet structure, I see businesses with high fixed 
costs and operations in cyclical sectors as much less capable of supporting high debt levels relative to their 
cashflows unless they are being run on a very high risk basis. 
13.A focus on the debt metrics is important too because if the business is overburdened with debt relative to its 
cash generation, its capacity to expand and strengthen its market position and take advantage of opportunities to 
build on its economies of scale may be curtailed. 
An investor – whether institutional or private – must also bear in mind the limitations of a company’s annual 
accounts as it reveals the balance sheet position only on one day per annum (and the company has the flexibility to 
choose year end and half year end dates that offer the best prospect of showing the company in the best financial 
light). This is especially so for seasonal businesses which have peaks and troughs in their borrowing position on 
particular months of the year. Choosing the trough month for borrowings for your year end may give a false 
impression of the underlying borrowing requirements of the business through the year as a whole. 
14.I am usually happy to leave a decent slice of the annual earnings per share of most of the companies in which I 
invest in the company itself rather than seeking a big dividend payout. It is not only more tax efficient, but if the 
company is delivering stellar returns on capital, I feel it is likely to do better with my money in terms of generating 
more capital growth than paying me a high dividend that will be subject to my marginal tax rate, USC and PRSI. 
It is prudent to look at big dividend payers with a jaundiced eye. The extent to which their dividends are covered by 
after-tax earnings is important and if they have had a run of annual dividend payments close to, or above, their 
after-tax annual earnings I ask myself two questions: is that dividend sustainable? Or has the company run out of 
investment opportunities to deliver an acceptable return on capital with the cash that is being generated within the 
business? 
15.Corporate governance, management stability. Track record on execution. Delivery on market guidance. Market 
opportunities and threats arising from regulatory developments or emerging technologies or social and 
demographic changes, and the capacity and track record to undertake successful acquisitions and to build scale 
are all important too. 
Invested: 15 questions to ask when investing
And finally, I keep an eye on regulatory developments in Brussels where industry lobbyists are powerful and self 
serving. Much of the evolving regulatory programme opens up opportunities for companies and niche players in 
areas such as health and safety and environmental standards – and threats for industries such as tobacco, 
although the tobacco companies’ global spread and lobbying nous has kept them in the premier division in terms of 
equity market performance and dividend growth delivery over many decades now.

Brexit campaigners object to Ryanair 'Fly home to vote Remain' sale
Brexit campaigners object to Ryanair 'Fly home to vote Remain' sale

       LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Campaigners for Britain to leave the European Union complained to police on Friday 
that Ryanair has broken election law through its 'Fly home to vote Remain' ticket promotion ahead of a referendum 
on June 23.  The airline, whose owner Michael O'Leary wants Britain to remain in the EU, offered British citizens 
one-way flights home for 19.99 pounds (29 dollars) on June 22 and June 23 for bookings made by midnight 
Thursday.  'By its discount on flights on the day before, and the day of the referendum, Ryanair is paying the 
expense, in part, of provision to voters in order to influence them to vote in the referendum,' Dominic Cummings, 
campaign director for Vote Leave, said in a letter of complaint to London's Metropolitan Police.  'This appears to be 
corrupt, since the company is offering discounts on the commercial rate to customers with the sole aim of ensuring 
that they vote and vote to remain in the European Union,' Cummings said. 
 The Metropolitan Police confirmed it had received the complaint and would examine it to determine whether any 
offence had been committed.   Reacting to the complaint, O'Leary extended the promotion for an extra 24 hours 
and said it 'fully complies with Ryanair's policy of lowering the cost of air travel' to and from Britain.  'The Leave 
campaign must be getting really desperate if they're objecting to low-fare air travel for British citizens, so we're 
pleased to extend our 'Fly home to vote Remain' sale by another 24 hours,' he said in a Ryanair statement.  'As the 
UK's largest airline, Ryanair is absolutely clear that the UK economy and its growth prospects are stronger as a 
member of the European Union and the single market than they are outside the EU,' O'Leary said.  British election 
law includes an offence of 'treating,' making it illegal for someone to 'directly or indirectly give or provide any food, 
drink, entertainment or provision to corruptly influence any voter to vote or refrain from voting.'  Cummings said 
Vote Leave believes the Ryanair offer counts as treating and could also contravene British law on bribery.

[Re: Is Ryanair risking its own reputation by coming out strongly for Remain? Tuesday]No. Ryanair's support for the 
Remain campaign is completely congruent with the reality of its business and its brand, and people like consistency 
between what brands say and what they do.
First, the brand's core appeal is its low cost fares and extensive routes. The EU's liberalised air policy allows 
airlines to operate without restriction and additional fees, critical for low-cost-carriers. Ryanair is the biggest low cost 
carrier in Europe, with 30+ European bases and over 110m www.passengers.No other European country has an 
exit referendum pending. Even if the company offends some pro-Brexit customers in the UK, the business impact 
would not be significant.
Second, its high profile support is also consistent with its outspoken, straight-talking brand personality. It provides 
Ryanair with free publicity consistent with what people would expect and reinforces the low-cost association of the 
brand. The only question, bearing in mind Ryanair's controversial brand image, is whether Remain would want its 
endorsement.
Sophie Devonshire, The Caffeine Partnership I have no problem with businesses explaining how Brexit might affect 
them, but I do have a problem with politically-motivated chief executives trying to scare the public because they've 
been asked to by politicians. That, to me, is an abuse of those companies' position as respected figures of 
authority. And customers should react accordingly.

Ryanair have been forced to cancel over 70 flights tomorrow to/from and over France with further delays likely.
This is the fifth French strike in two months and Ryanair havecalled on the European Commission to take action to 
prevent the strikes.
The airline says thousands of flights from the UK, Ireland, Spain and Italy - none of which either take off or land in 
France - are cancelled and hundreds of thousands of passengers' travel plans again disrupted.
Ryanair advised customers travelling on Thursday to check the status of their flight on the Ryanair.com website 
before travelling to the airport and urged all those affected to sign its Keep Europe's Skies Open petition, which it 
will present to the European Commission once it accrues a million signatures. Ryanair's Chief Marketing Officer, 
Kenny Jacobs commented, "Once more Europe's consumers are being held to ransom by tiny French ATC unions, 
causing hundreds of thousands of passenger flights to be cancelled or delayed, while the European Commission 
and French Government sit on their hands." He added, "As we approach the peak holiday season, European 
travellers should prepare for a summer of discontent as there is absolutely nothing preventing these selfish unions 
from staging even more strikes in the coming weeks and months." Source: www.businessworld.ie

Michael Jacobides YES At a time of heightened political sensibility and populist bashing of "big business", it feels 
risky for a corporation to take a clear stance on a key political debate. Brexit campaigners have already targeted 
Mark Carney for taking a view, despite the fact that his duties clearly call for an assessment, so Ryanair will take 
some heat. Still, this is a gamble that Ryanair has to take. Companies often help shape policy and, inasmuch as 
they are transparent, it is fair game for them to make their case. Provided that Ryanair as a company has 
established that Brexit will have a major adverse impact on its business, it owes it to its shareholders, employees 
and stakeholders to speak up. Corporate leaders who act in the interest of their companies and their stakeholders, 
rather than leveraging their power to advocate their personal political views, should join in the chorus, regardless of 
the risks, so that voters can know what the business world really believes.
£ Michael Jacobides is associate professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at London Business School.
Chris Rumfitt NO The referendum is one of the biggest decisions facing the country in decades and Ryanair is quite 
right to have its say. They have made their name as an "opinionated brand" and their chief executive is famously 
one of the most outspoken in British business. Every day, their customers and employees benefit from European 
freedom of movement, so they are just the right people to stand up for Remain. Other companies have also made 
their voice heard, but in putting ordinary passengers and staff at the centre of their case, Ryanair's message is 
especially powerful.
What are the risks? Well, if the Leave campaign wins, it might seek to make companies who fought against them 
pay a price. But frankly, from the perspective of most businesses, the thought of leaving the EU is such a gamble 
that if Leave does win, everything post 23 June looks like a black hole. Against that backdrop, there is no further 
threat the Outers hold against them.

Byline: George Parker in Stansted
Body
The Brexit debate has forged some strange alliances and few more surprising than George Osborne lining up with 
former foes Ed Balls and Sir Vince Cable in an aircraft hangar to warn of the dangers of leaving the EU.
While Mr Osborne last year delighted in defeating Mr Balls and Sir Vince, his one-time rivals buried past differences 
to help the chancellor avoid a similar fate if the UK votes to withdraw from the bloc in its June 23 referendum .
Mr Balls and Sir Vince joined the chancellor at a Ryanair hangar at Stansted airport yesterday to say that leaving 
the EU's single market would be "a one-way ticket to a poorer Britain".
Meanwhile, Mr Osborne's Conservative colleague Boris Johnson was touring the country continuing to attack his 
own government, including the "scandal" that NHS accident and emergency waiting times were at their highest 
ever.
While Mr Johnson argued that Britain could spend more on the health service if it left the EU, Mr Osborne, Mr Balls 
and Sir Vince said Brexit would impoverish the country.
Mr Balls, shadow chancellor until 2015, hopes their words will carry more weight because he and Sir Vince have 
moved away from politics and are more likely to be seen nowadays on Strictly Come Dancing or The Great British 
Bake Off than in the House of Commons.
Plane speaking: Leaving is one-way ticket to poverty, say old foes
To make the point, they assembled in a shed at Stansted with a Ryanair Boeing 737 painted with Remain campaign 
slogans. Michael O'Leary , Ryanair chief executive, said his company created 450 jobs in the UK this year but 
would scale back investment if Britain left the EU's single market. "If Britain isn't in the EU, those investment and 
jobs would be going to other countries," he said.
Sir Vince pointed out that the single market was "a British vision of an open Europe" and said that the world's best 
companies came to the UK because of it; many smaller companies formed the supply chain that served them.
Mr Osborne revealed another "new" Treasury figure about the cost of Brexit, claiming Britain could lose £200bn of 
exports and £200bn of inward investment by 2030 outside the single market.
The event confirmed the Remain camp's relentless focus on the economy following confirmation last weekend by 
Michael Gove , the pro-Brexit justice secretary, that if Britain left the EU it would also leave the single market.
Mr Osborne said this was one of the "decisive moments" of the campaign and criticised opponents for suggesting 
that warnings of economic dangers were part of an establishment conspiracy.
In a jibe at Mr Gove and Mr Johnson, the chancellor said the Leave camp seemed to believe in "a massive 
conspiracy" and would next accuse him of "faking the moon landing, kidnapping Shergar and covering up the 
discovery of the Loch Ness monster".
Mr Johnson fired back a jibe at David Cameron, saying accusations of conspiracy theories were "a bit rich from 
those who said World War Three would break out if we leave the European Union".
Mr Osborne said he was sceptical of polls that suggested the Remain camp's focus on the economy did not sway 
voters, with polls showing the two sides are neck and neck. "The argument is being won by those who say it would 
be economically costly to leave," he said.
Mr Osborne's focus on the economy in the Scottish independence referendum campaign in 2014 and the general 
election in 2015 had its doubters. But the presence of Sir Vince and Mr Balls alongside him yesterday was a 
reminder that establishing economic credibility has been a powerful weapon in the past.

O'Leary warned Britain faces higher holiday cost if it voted for Brexit. "I am absolutely certain that the UK economy 
is better off in Europe, and that is why Ryanair is campaigning hard and actively calling on UK voters to vote 
'Remain' on the 23 June," he said.

It was announced today that Ryanair will create over 1,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers in 2016.
Over 450 of these new jobs will be located at Ryanair's 13 UK airport bases to support its 14 new Boeing 737-800 
aircraft, an investment of over dollar 1.4bn in the British economy.
These new jobs will bring to more than 3,500 aviation professionals that Ryanair employs directly in Britain, in 
addition to sustaining thousands of support jobs at Ryanair's 18 UK airports.
Welcoming the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon George Osborne MP, to its new European Training Centre 
today, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary called for a strong "Remain" vote in the European Referendum on 23rd June 
next.O'Leary commented, "The single market has enabled Ryanair to lead the low fare air travel revolution in 
Europe, as we bring millions of British citizens to Europe each year, and welcome millions of European visitors to 
Britain, and we are calling on everyone to turn out in large numbers and vote "Remain" on the 23rd June." The 
Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne added, "I'm delighted to be at Ryanair today to hear about their 
plans to create 450 new highly skilled jobs this year in the UK, and welcome their call for Britain to remain part of 
the European Union. Today's announcement is just another example of how British jobs and livelihoods directly

May 16, 2016( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  Finance minister George 
Osborne attacked pro-Brexit campaigners for saying Britain should not just leave the European Union but also its 
single market, as he sought to convince voters that the economy faces big risks in next month's referendum. 
Osborne said Britain would lose 200 billion pounds ($287 billion) a year in trade in 15 years' time and miss out on 
the same amount in foreign investment, if it fell back on World Trade Organization rules to govern its ties with the 
EU after a Brexit. 
"Leaving the EU is a one-way ticket to a poorer Britain," Osborne told media in an aircraft hangar at Stansted 
Airport, northeast of London, where the head of airline Ryanair said his firm could lower investment after an "Out" 
vote. Opinion polls have shown that voters tend to think that staying in the EU would be better for Britain's economy 
but they also remain almost evenly split between those who want to stay in the bloc and those who want to leave. 
As part of a relentless series of warnings about the economic risks of Brexit, Osborne's finance ministry is due to 
publish a report on the short-term impact of an "Out" vote soon. A leading supporter of the "Vote Leave" campaign, 
justice minister Michael Gove said earlier this month that Britain should also leave the single market after a Brexit. If 
a post-Brexit Britain wanted to remain part of the single market, it would probably face demands from the rest of the 
bloc to keep its borders open to EU workers and to continue paying into the EU's budget, just as Norway and 
Switzerland do. The "Out" campaign has put stopping high levels of immigration and Britain's contributions to the 
EU budget at the center of their message to voters. Osborne spoke on Monday alongside former Labour Party 
economics spokesman Ed Balls, who was long a critic of Osborne, and former business minister Vince Cable, a 
senior member of the opposition Liberal Democrat party. Balls and Cable both said Britain risked economic damage 
if it left the EU. Osborne also accused the "Out" campaign of resorting to conspiracy theories ahead of the 
referendum for calling into question the motives of global bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development when they spoke of the economic risks of Brexit. "The 
economic argument is beyond doubt. It's not a conspiracy, it's called a consensus," Osborne said.

Byline: Michael Murray
Highlight: Here’s how to start building a balanced portfolio
Body
One of the remarkable things about the financial crisis we went through from 2008 until recently is how little appears 
to have changed in the thought processes of so many Irish investors. Most got badly burnt by an overexposure – 
either directly or indirectly – to the property sector. 
But there is little to suggest a growing appreciation of the merits of other asset classes which can offer easier and 
potentially safer longer-term returns and advantages when you take all of the factors pertaining to property relative 
to other asset classes into account – returns, costs, liquidity, management, tenant risk, possible regulatory risk and 
asset concentration. 
Many Irish investors fail to focus on risk correlations. But one thing which hopefully has been learned is the major 
risk correlation that exists between Irish property investment and shares in Irish banks given that more than five 
times the banks’ shareholder funds are invested in property by way of loans and mortgages on property. 
By contrast, with the exception of a few Reits, property represents only a tiny proportion of the other Irish listed 
companies’ assets. 
The shares of the major Irish listed companies (ie, aside from the banks which were wrecked by property) – CRH, 
Ryanair, Kerry Group, Smurfit Kappa, DCC, Greencore, Paddy Power Betfair, and Kingspan – have delivered 
returns to their investors in the past decade ranging from 250 per cent to over 1,000 per cent. 
The returns from property over the same period have been not far from between zero at the best end and minus 20 
per cent or more at the lower end, depending on location and property segment. 
But it is not just the single asset class that private investors in this country have been over-focused on. To the 
extent that they have invested in shares, their focus has been overwhelmingly on Irish shares. Yet the size of the 
Michael Murray: Irish investors love to tie themselves down to property, and that is their undoing.
Irish equity market, by capitalisation, is less than 0.5 per cent of the size of the US market, according to the World 
Bank, less than 5 per cent of the British market, and less than 0.25 per cent of the market capitalisation of all of the 
world’s stock markets put together. 
So focusing on one small equity market exposes you to just a tiny proportion of the global equity investment 
opportunity. Why do so many Irish investors stick to the home knitting – but especially property, and shares 
correlated to property? 
Aside from the inferior historic returns on Irish property versus other asset classes, bear in mind some of the other 
disadvantages of residential property as an investment – be it in Ireland or elsewhere – compared with blue-chip 
shares and indeed other asset classes. 
First, there is the risk concentration issue with a single residential property in a single location. Secondly, there is 
the liquidity risk if the market turns sour. Thirdly, there is the tenant concentration risk of default. 
Fourthly, there are all of the outgoings on property that many investors don’t take into account when they are 
measuring the yield from the asset. 
Repair and maintenance costs, upgrading and modernisation, service charges, void periods between one tenant 
leaving and another taking over, rent loss from tenant default risk, lease registration costs, and agents’ letting fees 
plus Vat all nibble away at your return. 
Deduct all of these from the gross rent over a five-year period, and you are likely to come to a net pre-tax yield on 
the capital value of the property of not much more than 60-65 per cent of the gross yield. That brings the true pre-
tax yield for good quality residential property down to similar levels to (or even lower levels than) good quality, large 
and liquid equities. 
Every asset class has cyclical characteristics. For that reason, it is sensible to look at the returns of different asset 
classes over the long term. For this purpose, I will exclude what one might call the “indulgent” asset classes of fine 
wine, art and classic cars – all of which, if well chosen, have proved capable of delivering handsome capital 
appreciation over time. 
The asset classes I have chosen are ones which I believe are appropriate for investors seeking to build a balanced 
portfolio that takes account of the different types of investment and financial risk including inflation – and so risks to 
real returns over time. 
So, equities, corporate bonds, government bonds, index-linked bonds, and cash have a place in this portfolio. While 
inflation has been low in this country over the past decade, it makes sense to look at how assets perform in real 
terms against inflation over long periods of time and to be conscious of the possibility that, at some stage in the next 
decade or two, higher inflation may once again raise its ugly head. 
There are, of course, no perfect hedges against inflation, but there are index-linked gilts where the coupon tracks 
the rate of inflation. Since 1900, equities have consistently paid back in real terms during periods of low to high 
single-digit inflation, and during periods of deflation. 
But in periods of double-digit inflation, both equities and gilts have delivered annualised negative real returns. For 
that reason, carrying some weighting in a balanced portfolio in index linked bonds might make sense as a modest 
hedge – especially for those relying on fixed income pensions, for example. 
The time to move on such a hedge is when the vista of a return to inflation looks to be a good distance off, because 
once that vista raises its head, the price of index-linked bonds is likely to rise markedly. 
But as between equities, gilts, and cash, although equities have been more volatile than the other asset classes, 
taking the 115 years since 1900, the average annual return from British and US equities has outstripped by far the 
inflation rate, as well as the return on cash and bonds. 
Michael Murray: Irish investors love to tie themselves down to property, and that is their undoing.
In the case of Britain, the average annual total return from equities over the 115 years has been 9.3 per cent versus 
3.9 per cent for inflation, 4.7 per cent for cash and 5.2 per cent from gilts. 
Despite the devastation in the banking sector and the more recent drop in hard commodity prices and the heavy 
weightings of both of these sectors in the overall British equity market indices, over all ten, 15 and 25 year periods 
the average annual total returns from British equities have outstripped inflation quite comfortably. The same applies 
to other developed economies. 
Still, there have been some periods when equity investors have been crushed unless they held on for recovery. 
During the period of high double-digit inflation rates in the mid-1970s, equity returns more than halved over two 
years: down by nearly one quarter in 1973 and by nearly another 50 per cent in 1974. 
But patient investors saw British equity returns rebounding quickly in 1975 to 145 per cent. After a fairly flat 
performance in 1976, returns jumped to 51.8 per cent in 1977. This was followed by ten years of double digit annual 
returns. 
While the past is no guide to the future, an examination of trends over 115 years suggests to me that a heavy 
weighting in a well diversified portfolio of equities makes huge sense unless one anticipates an extraordinary 
political upheaval or event that inflicts long-term damage on businesses and capitalist economies. 
That said, I am prepared to park close on 20 per cent of my capital in cash at present – some of which I may deploy 
in other assets (such as index-linked bonds and gold) over the coming months, given the rising levels of political 
instability in pockets of Europe and the Middle East . . . not to mention Brexit risks following the British referendum 
next month. 
Asset classes aside, I view the composition of my exposure within the equity class to be critical: I am essentially a 
conservative investor seeking long-term capital growth ahead of inflation, but my portfolio is heavily weighted 
towards companies in energy distribution, healthcare services, and ones that have iconic consumer staple brands 
as well as ones that serve consumer addiction. 
Also, aside from a few medium-sized and high-growth niche operators, I keep my portfolio heavily weighted towards 
shares that are highly liquid and can be easily traded if necessary. 
As for real estate, aside from my home I have a single exposure to a well-managed pan-European multimillion 
square foot industrial property company with strong cashflows from thousands of tenants across four countries. 
But I have no further appetite for the sector, least of all for a single property in an Ireland that looks to be moving 
towards serious political instability and socialist-driven spending. In the absence of the emergence of politicians 
who have the guts and the capacity to articulate the case for capitalism, or indeed a change in our electoral system, 
this looks set to become the dangerous and unappetising norm. 
No two individuals’ personal circumstances are the same but an awareness of the multitude of investment 
opportunities and asset classes available and consideration of their relative advantages in terms of liquidity, growth 
prospects and diversification is essential. 
A portfolio diversified by asset class, by geography, and by sector will invariably deliver disappointment from time to 
time but almost certainly not devastation. 
 Over the long term, if prudently built up, it is likely to deliver returns comfortably ahead of inflation. 
And after a good decade of equity returns, a visit to the classic car showrooms, the art galleries and the wine vaults 
to modestly indulge your success might be called for.

Ryanair would move some investment out of Britain if it votes to leave the European Union and the "extreme 
volatility" that would follow such an outcome could put downward pressure on air fares in the short term, its chief 
executive said on Friday.
The Irish low-cost airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, flies 40 million of its 100 million-plus passengers 
a year to and from the United Kingdom and has its largest hub at London's Stansted Airport.
CEO Michael O'Leary is one of the most vocal business leaders campaigning for a vote to remain ahead of the 
June 23 referendum on EU membership.
"After 9/11, after every crisis Ryanair is selling cheaper fares, we keep people flying. So the fact is it would have a 
downward effect on our pricing for six to 12 months, but we will keep people flying," O'Leary told reporters. "The 
longer term effect though is we will invest less in the UK, we will certainly switch some of our existing UK 
investment into other European counties because we want to continue to invest in the European Union and it will be 
bad for air travel and British tourism." British air fares could also rise sharply in the long term if a vote to leave 
threatened Britain's access to EU air services agreements, he added. A Brexit may also put some downward 
pressure on aircraft prices and O'Leary said there is always an opportunity for Ryanair to stock up in such a 
downturn, though its current supply of Boeing planes takes it out until 2023. However, he said the "Remain" 
campaign should be cautious about warning of "apocalyptic scenarios." While a period of extraordinary volatility 
would undoubtedly follow for six to 12 months after a Brexit, fundamental economics would then take over and 
sterling would recover, O'Leary said. Ryanair is spending around 25,000 euros to run advertisements calling on its 
customers to vote to remain, he said, and would step up that marketing drive closer to the referendum date. "Most 
of the contribution being made by Ryanair is through our email, our customer base, advocating a remain vote 
Ryanair would pull investment from UK if it leaves EU Ryanair would p...
because we fundamentally believe it's in the UK's best interests to remain in Europe," O'Leary said. "Will Ryanair 
have any effect? I think not really. Around the margins, we may." (Reuters) Source: www.businessworld.ie

It was announced today that Ryanair has signed a deal with Comtrade which will see the software engineering 
services and solutions provider developing the carrier's myRyanair platform, an application that speeds up the 
booking process by over 20% and assists passengers with their entire journey.
It allows customers to select their travel preferences by creating a personal profile to securely store payment and 
passport details and search Ryanair's 1,800 air fare routes; ensuring faster bookings and flight check-ins.
Based on a customer's personal profile, myRyanair can assist with other travel-related activities, from tailored 
holiday tips to money-saving logistics. At the customer's choosing, it can link them with other passengers whom 
they can share a taxi with, remember what plane seats they prefer or offer restaurant suggestions for the 
destination.
Ryanair claims the launch of myRyanair signals the airline's push to disrupt and transform the aviation industry by 
becoming a digital travel company with pioneering, customer-focused technology. With a strong emphasis on 
customer service, the carrier aims to grow its passenger numbers to 180 million per annum by 2024. Working from 
the vision of Ryanair's user interface (UI) design team, Comtrade developed myRyanair and turned it into an 
application capable of securely handling and processing the details of Ryanair's 106 million annual passengers. 
With a focus on speed, it can also fill four Boeing 737s every minute at peak booking times. CTO of Ryanair, John 
Hurley says, "In the future, I see Ryanair as a digital travel leader that happens to have an airline attached to it. We 
want to use technology to personalise the user experience for our increasingly tech-savvy customer base and 
myRyanair is very strategic and central to that vision." He added, "The scale of myRyanair is phenomenal. It is built 
to handle the details of 106 million people and as we grow, myRyanair's capabilities will grow with it. Our 
Ryanair to become 'Digital travel leader' of the future; Ryanair to beco...
partnership with Comtrade was fundamental to turning myRyanair from a vision to a reality." Source:

Load factor for the month of February 2016 was 93%, an increase of four percentage points, compared to 89% for

load factor jumped 4% points to 93%. These record monthly numbers and load factors are due to our lower fares, 
our stronger forward bookings and the continuing success of our "Always Getting Better" customer experience

enjoy more service enhancements, as we continue Year 2 of our AGB programme, which includes our new website, 
new app, new cabin interiors, new crew uniforms, and improved inflight menus, as Ryanair continues to deliver 
much more than just the lowest fares and the most on time flights in Europe."

It's nice for a chap to have a hobby. Over the years Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou has campaigned for higher dividends 
from easyJet with the passion others devote to ornithology or model trains.
Result! Yesterday, the low-cost airline he founded said it would raise payouts from 40 per cent to 50 per cent of 
earnings, as he has demanded.
EasyJet framed the change in the context of a review of its capital structure. Carolyn McCall , the airline's 
impressive chief executive, pointed out that payouts had hit 50 per cent before, thanks to special dividends.
But this still looked like a victory for the entrepreneur, who controls 33 per cent of the company.
Payout ratios are in vogue for dividend setting because they spare businesses cyclical squeezes. A high payout 
ratio suggests that a business has limited opportunity to generate big returns from investing retained earnings. That 
is a characteristic of mature businesses. EasyJet's middling ratio is therefore somewhat at odds with Dame 
Carolyn's belief that she can grab lots more market share from European flag carriers.
She would be assisted, of course, by easyJet's low costs. These now include an investment-grade credit rating, 
making it possible to raise debt cheaply. Revealingly, perhaps, the group has abandoned its target gearing range of 
30-50 per cent.
Politics of payout ratios
Sales growth is meanwhile set to slow, according to S&P CIQ estimates. It seems Sir Stelios sees easyJet maturing 
faster, or at least growing more slowly, than Dame Carolyn does. Differences of this kind do not trouble Ryanair, 
another low-cost airline. That may be one reason its shares trade at a premium to those of easyJet.

Highlight: Investors “nervous" carrier will expoit volatility to introduce low initial guidance
Body
Budget airline Ryanair has “heavily underperformed” in the aviation sector and wider market in the last month, 
according to new analysis of the aviation sector. 
Investors are “nervous that the company will take the opportunity of April/May volatility to introduce a particularly 
low” initial guidance for its likely performance next year when it announces full-year results later this month, said a 
report into the European aviation sector by analysts at Barclays.  
“Another bumpy start to the summer,” said the report about the wider sector.  
 “April/May have clearly been very tough for the European airline industry, with Brussels terror attacks weighing on 
bookings, combined with operational disruption from ATC/security strikes in France and Germany.” 
Nevertheless, Barclays is optimistic about Ryanair’s fortunes. 
It says that it continues to believe that the Irish airline’s “self-help transformation will enable it to outperform the rest 
of the industry on yields, as load factor tops out and its capacity growth slows”.  
Ryanair is described as Barclays’ “top pick” in the sector and it predicts further growth at the airline of 10 per cent 
over the summer months.  
It emerged last week that Ryanair and British Airways  are close to a passenger sharing deal. 
Barclays highlights Dublin, as well as Copenhagen, Cologne, Stansted and Rome’s Fiumicino, as likely growth 
airports for the airline.   
“We believe Ryanair has engaged in significant promotional activity to stimulate traffic following Brussels,” said the 
report.

The Irish Independent has today reported that Ryanair is likely to feed passengers to the Aer Lingus long-haul 
network as part of what would be an unprecedented formal agreement between the two former arch rivals, 
according to IAG chief executive Willie Walsh.
The proposed deal could see Ryanair feeding passengers from its extensive network at Dublin to Aer Lingus routes 
serving North America.
Mr Walsh said IAG remains open to the feeder idea with Ryanair and that there's "no objection to it". Speaking 
yesterday, the IAG chief executive said, "If customers want to connect from a Ryanair flight, we're very happy to do 
that. There were some commercial issues, but I think it's workable."
The IAG chief executive said he doesn't agree with Mr O'Leary's prediction that legacy carriers such as British 
Airways or Lufthansa will eventually cull their short-haul networks. Last month, Mr O'Leary told the Irish 
Independent that Ryanair will trial interlining at London Stansted and Barcelona later this summer. He said that 
would allow passengers travelling from cities that may not have a major Ryanair route network, such as Belfast, to 
connect to other Ryanair services at Stansted to onwards destinations. IAG, which also owns British Airways, Iberia 
and Vueling, acquired Aer Lingus last year for E1.36bn. Ryanair had tried three times to buy Aer Lingus but was 
blocked by Brussels. Source: www.businessworld.ie

Highlight: The Boeing Company and Ryanair Ltd. have announced the delivery of the airline's 400th next-
generation 737-800.
Body
"The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with its industry leading technical reliability and seating capacity, has been the 
foundation upon which our successful and safe growth has been built upon, since we took our first delivery in March 
1999," said Ryanair's Chief Operations Officer, Michael Hickey. "We are delighted to be now taking delivery of our 
400th 737-800, which includes the new Boeing Sky Interior and slimline seats, offering extra leg room and an 
enhanced customer experience, as part of our 'Always Getting Programme'." "A key factor in Ryanair's continued 
success is the outstanding economics of the Next-Generation 737-800," said Monty Oliver, vice president, 
European Sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. 
"This 400th 737 delivery is a special milestone for both our companies and we are honored that Ryanair continues 
to be an all-Boeing operator." Ryanair has more than 130 unfilled orders for Next-Generation 737-800s and is also 
the launch customer for the 737 MAX 200, the newest member of the 737 MAX family. The Dublin-based carrier 
ordered 100 737 MAX 200s, a variant based on the successful 737 MAX 8, that can accommodate up to 200 seats, 
increasing revenue potential and providing airlines with up to 20 percent better fuel efficiency per seat than today's 
most efficient single-aisle airplanes.

Highlight: Ryanair Ltd. has commenced works on a new flight simulator project at its headquarters in Swords, 
Dublin.
Body
Once complete, this new flight simulator will allow Ryanair to assess cadets and provide an industry leading 
opportunity for pilots to practice their manual handling skills in a relaxed environment. Atkins is providing 
multidiscipline services including; civil and structural, architecture, M&E and fire safety engineering. 
Design works where provided from concept stage through to construction including planning and tender stages. 
Atkins is also providing PSDP and assigned certifier roles. The new annex building which includes a link bridge to 
the existing Ryanair HQ will house the first of a new generation fixed base flight simulator. The building includes two 
new briefing rooms and a large open area in which the simulator will be located. Construction is currently underway 
on site and is expected to complete by the end of May 2016. Justin Norman, director, Atkins, said: "Atkins is 
delighted to be project designers for the new annex to house the simulator. We look forward to completing this 
exciting project successfully with Ryanair and Ganson contractors." Garry Hanratty, project manager, Atkins, said: 
"It's exciting to work with such a dynamic client. The proposed building is being constructed on an existing 
reinforced concrete podium slab which brings its own set of challenges from a design and construction perspective. 
Another interesting challenge is the requirement to keep the Ryanair HQ building and surround infrastructure 
operational at all times. Atkins ultimate goal is to ensure Ryanair has a purpose built building to showcase their first 
new generation fixed base flight simulators."

Body
Europe's airlines are cutting costs and pledging to pare back the expansion of routes and flights across the 
continent as the boost to their profits from low oil prices fades. Lufthansa this week followed International Airlines 
Group, which owns British Airways and Iberia, in promising to curb capacity .
Should we believe that they - and the US airlines that have been making the highest profits in the world - can 
change their ways and ensure that the industry behaves in a more disciplined fashion than before? Put it this way: 
history is not on their side.
The global airline industry has achieved a remarkable feat in the past couple of years. For the first time since US 
airline deregulation in 1978, it has made sufficiently high profits to be worth investing in. Its recovery from the twin 
shocks of the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the financial crisis of 2008 has led to something unfamiliar - 
a respectable bottom line .
You would not know that from the reaction of investors: share prices of US airlines have fallen in 2016, although it is 
likely to be their most rewarding year ever. Like airline luggage, what travels hopefully may not arrive. Shareholders 
have little faith that the companies will resist their old instinct to redistribute all profits to their customers by adding 
new flights and trimming fares.
As one of these customers, I welcome that. Air travel may not be a pleasant experience, but it has become 
remarkably cheap and flexible. I recently found, for example, a return flight from London City Airport to Rotterdam - 
Airlines will keep on flying for no money
both secondary airports - on CityJet, the Irish airline, for £140 including taxes. That would have been outlandish in 
the past but is now commonplace.
Another example: when booking a holiday in Turkey (fares are soft following recent terrorist attacks in Istanbul and 
Ankara), I saw that EasyJet allowed me the choice of landing at three different airports in southern Turkey. At times, 
it feels as if low-cost airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair have taken lessons from Starbucks in clustering 
destinations as tightly as coffee shops.
They can do so profitably because their costs are low, but the relentless growth in flight capacity in the past few 
decades makes it harder for rivals such as Air France-KLM. The number of direct flights such as London-Rotterdam 
has risen from 6,000 globally in 1980 to 17,000 this year; passenger air travel has expanded tenfold in 40 years as 
more people fly more often.
This persistent imbalance of supply and demand - worsened by the fact that new entrants tend to keep on adding 
flights even when legacy carriers try to retrench - has turned airlines into what Warren Buffett once called "a death 
trap for investors". Berkshire Hathaway's chairman should know, having invested $358m in US Air (now part of 
American Airlines) in 1989 and bemoaned his mistake ever since.
Consolidation into the big three legacy airlines - American, Delta and United Airlines - with low-cost Southwest 
making four, has perked up US profitability. "Capacity discipline", the US industry's term for not behaving as laxly as 
usual, helped global airlines to make a respectable return on capital last year. Even so, Mr Buffett is right to prefer 
US railways to airlines as an investment. By coincidence, Delta matched BNSF, the railroad company owned by 
Berkshire, on two measures last year. Both held a 17 per cent share of their respective industries; both made 
operating profits of about $7.8bn.
The resemblance ends there. Even in an exceptional year, Delta's operating margin was 19 per cent compared with 
BNSF's 35 per cent in an ordinary one (it took Delta $41bn of revenues to achieve this operating profit while BNSF 
required only $22bn). BNSF, which runs 32,500 miles of track , is also far better shielded from competition - no one 
will build a matching set of lines.
In theory, airlines should not risk the sacrifice of hard-won profits by adding to capacity at the peak of the cycle and 
returning to wasting capital. Those such as IAG and Lufthansa are trying to avoid it by offering route cuts this week, 
although Lufthansa's share price fell after its first-quarter results .
But there are several obstacles to what would count as common sense in other industries. One is the fierce 
response of regulators. The US Justice Department nearly blocked the merger of American and US Airways in 2013 
because of worries about a potential reduction in competition. Last year, it launched an inquiry into possible 
collusion after airline chief executives talked publicly of "capacity discipline".
Even if regulators were not determined to stamp on profitability, airlines will probably do it themselves. A 
combination of high fixed costs and low seat prices makes it hard to shed capacity - keeping an aircraft sitting on 
the tarmac can end up being more expensive than filling the seats with people paying low fares. As Air France has 
found with recalcitrant pilots , it is difficult for legacy airlines to reduce their wage bills.
In other words, an industry that has been run for decades like a privately financed public utility, with shareholders 
being squeezed and customers reaping the benefits, will probably carry on like that. Happy travels, everyone.

Body
The attacks on Brussels in March continue to dampen demand for flying in Europe, though traffic was strong during 
the Easter holidays, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said on Wednesday.
O'Leary last month predicted Ryanair's profits would fall by 10-20 million euros in January-March as a result of the 
Brussels attacks and air traffic control strikes, and forecast airlines would have to cut fares.
British Airways-owner IAG and Lufthansa in recent days cited the Brussels attacks as a factor in trimming growth 
plans for the year.
"The Brussels effect has dampened demand into April-May though funnily enough it did not create as much 
disruption over the Easter period, but I think that's because a lot of families had holidays booked," O'Leary told 
journalists at a conference in Dublin. He said Brussels Zaventem airport, where suicide bombs killed 16 people, 
would be back up to full capacity by the end of June and the impact on summer demand would depend on whether 
there were further attacks. "The danger for us is that you have one or two more of these events somewhere in 
Europe during the summer and that will effect confidence," he said. Asked if he was concerned about summer 
demand, O'Leary said he was "always worried about (consumer) confidence ... business is going great and when 
business is going great, that's when you worry." Ryanair is due to announce its results for the year to the end of 
March on May 23. (Reuters) Source: www.businessworld.ie

Body
Howard Millar, former Ryanair deputy chief, will head Stellwagen Capital, a subsidiary of Aviation Finance Company 
(AFC).
He will also serve as chief operating officer of Stellwagen Group, the holding company of AFC and Seraph Aviation 
Management.
Stellwagen Capital has announced plans for a $1 billion initial capital raise from institutional investors in Europe and 
the USA by the fourth quarter of this year.
The company expected to raise up to $5 billion from worldwide institutional investors over the next three years.
Investors will include insurance funds, pension funds, banks and investment funds. The group plans to list the 
investment vehicle on the Dublin Stock Exchange via loan notes.
"We will use innovative and highly efficient structures to raise capital for secured financing of both new and 
delivered aircraft, and generate significant returns for our investors," says Millar. "The leveraging of my own and the 
group's outstanding aircraft financing knowledge and experience will have a transformational impact on the 
industry."
Millar brings "game changing" ability to the group with 23 years' experience in aviation, including raising capital in 
the public and debt markets, says Douglas Brennan,Stellwagen Group's chief executive.
"Howard will lead this innovative financing vehicle in raising capital from both the debt markets and from large 
institutional investors mainly, in Europe and the US. This capital will enable the Group to provide secured aircraft 
financing to airlines across the globe," adds Brennan.

Highlight: CEO of StellCap looks to raise capital to fund narrowbodies, A350s and 787s.
Body
Howard Millar, the new CEO of Stellwagen Capital (StellCap) and former CFO of Ryanair, intends to raise $5 billion 
to provide airlines an alternative to operating leasing.
"The economics for an airline in terms of an operating lease are at certain times, not hugely advantageous," he tells 
Airfinance Journal. "We will raise capital, through StellCap. Our sister company AFC will originate the loans and I 
will raise capital and collateralise the loans."
Through StellCap, a newly-formed subsidiary of Stellwagen Finance Company, Millar looks to raise $1 billion by the 
final quarter of 2016 to provide financing for airlines buying aircraft, reaching a total of $5 billion over three years.
"That's our first fund. It will be a 10-year fund, so for the first raise, we've gone to our US lawyers last week and 
we're appointing the people who are going to run our regulated vehicle this week," he adds. "So our plan is to list 
the loan notes on the Dublin Stock Exchange. We are preparing the prospectus for that and we would hope to go 
live in the fourth quarter."
According to Millar, the fund will primarily focus on financing narrowbody aircraft, including Boeing 737s and Airbus 
A320s, but will also consider looking at financing A350 and 787s as well. AFC will continue to work in more 
specialised funds for A380s.
Over a 10-year period, Millar is offering loan-to-values (LTVs) of 80-85% and with "a significant balloon payment of 
the end", of a higher percentage than a typical transaction.
"This is something that is designed to appeal to large pension funds, insurance companies who want to put capital 
to work for a 10-year period and get a targeted return of 8 to 9% per annum," he says.
Millar adds that he has been speaking to investors in the US, Europe, the Middle East and an investor about a 
potential renminbi loan note as well.
Airlines that use the fund will get to own the aircraft at the end of the loan. This is not the case in operating leases 
where the lessor maintains ownership of the aircraft.
Millar to raise $5bn for operating lease alternative
At the end of the 10-year period, the airline can decide to either refinance the aircraft or it can decide to sell it and 
pay off the balloon.
"It's a similar structure to a finance lease, but it's more like a mortgage-debt-type financing. It's a relatively simple 
structure. Airlines pay away huge amounts of maintenance reserves and the operating lessors are making a lot of 
their trading gains from the maintenance reserves."
Millar says that the structure will offer "superior cashflows for the airline" when compared to an operating lease of 
the same tenor.

Highlight: No raises for those earning over €100,000 per year except in very exceptional circumstances
Body
Top executives at Ryanair will not receive a pay rise this year because the airline is facing significant challenges, 
according to a note issued to staff from its chief executive, Michael O’Leary. 
Ryanair’s senior management team has seen its pay and bonuses frozen until April 2017 at the earliest. There will 
be no pay increase for non-crew employees earning over €100,000 per year except in very exceptional 
circumstances, O’Leary said. 
In the note, seen by The Sunday Business Post, O’Leary said the factors causing the challenges included the 
terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels, increasing price competition from other airlines, targets for traffic growth, and 
an expectation that fares would continue to fall this year after a flat year in 2015. 
O’Leary said he had expected fares to be flat in the last quarter of 2015, but they fell by 1 per cent, while in the 
three months to March, he had expected fares to fall by 3 per cent, but they were now forecast to fall by 6 per cent. 
The note said the airline had “little room for movement this year on pay”, as it would have to further cut its costs to 
fund lower fares, in order to deliver more value and better service for customers. 
The Ryanair board approved a pay increase of 2 per cent for non-crew employees earning under €100,000 per year 
who had no performance or attendance issues in the past 12 months. The company recently concluded long-term 
pay agreements with pilots and cabin crews. 
In February, the airline said its pre-tax profit for the three months to the end of December rose to €103 million, up 
from €49 million for the same period the previous year.

Highlight: Irish LCC reports â,¬1.24 billion profit after tax for its fiscal year.
Body
Ryanair reported a â,¬1.24 billion ($1.39 billion) profit after tax for its 2016 fiscal year, ended 31 March, up from 
â,¬867 million in the previous year.
Total revenues reached â,¬6.53 billion last year, a 16% increase from the â,¬5.65 billion the previous year.
"FY16 was a year in which we delivered significant traffic and profit growth in all four quarters (despite an average 
oil price of $90 per barrel as a consequence of hedges put in place in 2014) as our AGB (Always Getting Better) 
service programme is attracting millions of new customers to our lowest fare and lowest cost model," Michael 
O'Leary, the carrier's CEO, said in a statement.
During the year, traffic increased 18% to 106.4 million passengers. Year-on-year unit costs fell by 6%, says 
Ryanair.
The carrier expects its fuel bill to fall some â,¬200 million in fiscal year 2017 as lower Euro pricing is partially offset 
by bigger volumes due to growth.
Ryanair anticipates between â,¬1.37 billion and â,¬1.42 billion for its 2017 full year net profit guidance. "This 
remains heavily dependent on the strength of close-in summer bookings and next winter's yields, the strength of 
Sterling and the absence of any further external shocks or significant ATC strikes/cancellations," it comments in a 
statement.
Ryanair recorded a â,¬317.5 million gain after selling a 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus for â,¬398 million.
During the year, â,¬1.84 billion net cash flow was generated by operating activities.
In its 2016 fiscal year Ryanair took delivery of 41 new Boeing 737-800 units and net capital expenditure reached 
â,¬1.21 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents reached 1.26 billion at the end of the year, up from â,¬1.18 billion in 2015.
Debt repayments accounted for â,¬384.9 million.
Ryanair 's year-on-year profit rises by 43%
This year the Irish low-cost carrier plans to receive 52 aircraft, which will grow its fleet to 380 units by year-end.

Ireland's most reputable organisations are being celebrated today after the Reputations Agency released their 
Ireland RepTrak 2016 study.
The study was compiled by the Reputations Agency and their global partners the Reputation Institute and ranks the 
100 largest and most visible organisations in Ireland based on 5,093 responses gathered from the general public 
from 4th January to 14th March 2016.
Bord Bia has been named the most reputable organisation in Ireland followed by Eason & Son (2nd), An Post (3rd), 
Google (4th) and Lidl (5th).
The independent study ranked each company on its RepTrak Pulse score, representing an average measure of 
four emotional indicators: trust, esteem, admiration and good feeling. It also studied how organisations were rated 
across the seven more rational dimensions of reputation - leadership, products & services, innovation, governance, 
workplace, performance and citizenship. This is the seventh year of the most comprehensive study of corporate 
reputations undertaken in Ireland. This year's report shows that organisations operating in food related sectors were 
among those with the top reputations, with eight ranked in the top 20 - Bord Bia (1st), Lidl (5th), Aldi (7th), 
SuperValu (11th), Kellogg's (14th ), Glanbia (15th), Cadbury (16th) and Kerry Group (20th). Indigenous Irish 
organisations were also well represented in the top rankings with four listed in the coveted top six positions - Bord 
Bia (1st), Eason & Son (2nd), An Post (3rd), and The Irish League of Credit Unions (6th). The reputation of the 
leading sporting bodies was tracked with the IRFU achieving the highest ranking in that sector at 23rd place overall. 
GAA was ranked 49th while FAI was placed in 95th position overall. The report indictes that the reputation of 
companies among the general public fell slightly in 2016 having flatlined in 2015, following rises in trust recorded in 
2013 and 2014. Furthermore, the report shows that companies investing in building their reputation are winning 
competitive advantage. Ryanair's continued focus on customer experience with its "Always Getting Better"

programme, now in its third year, has seen it rise from 99th place in 2013 to 63rd position in 2016. During that 
period its share price has almost tripled. Managing Director at The Reputations Agency, Niamh Boyle says, 
"Reputation drives business results as a strong reputation helps to win customers, attract the right people, gain 
support from key stakeholders and ultimately drive business performance." She added, "Therefore, it is essential for 
organisational leaders to have a deep understanding of what is driving their own reputational ranking. Armed with 
the insights from this reputational analysis a business can take steps to build on their strengths and correct their

The three star Carnegie Court Hotel in Swords, Co Dublin, has been brought to the market by Savills with a guide

The hotel also houses one of Swords' best-known bars the Harp, the Courtyard restaurant and Rouge nightclub.
Carnegie Court is a popular venue for weddings and special occasions with conference and banqueting facilities. 
The property was granted planning permission for an additional 35 bedrooms within the existing ground and first

Sir, Theresa Villiers, the Northern Ireland secretary, tells the FT that Nigel Lawson, another leading campaigner for 
Brexit, "made a mistake" when he said "there would have to be border controls" to stop migrants entering the UK 
from the Republic of Ireland if Britain left the EU ( report , April 15).
But, if there are no border controls with Ireland, how will the Leave campaign keep its promise to stop free 
movement of people from the EU? Ms Villiers' answer is that migrants who entered illegally via the Irish border 
could be dealt with by the authorities once they had arrived. Presumably, that means tracking down these EU 
citizens and sending them home.
Forget the fact that the UK government is not terribly good at finding illegal migrants. Even if it did grab them, what 
would be the point in sending them home? Wouldn't they just jump on the next Ryanair to Dublin and return to the 
UK? After all, any EU citizen would still have the right to go to Ireland.

Have you always been interested in aviation?
Yes, I have always been a big fan of flying. When I saw the advertisement for an aircraft maintenance 
apprenticeship it immediately caught my eye, as it would enable me to learn exactly how aircraft got in the air and 
stayed there.
What are your qualifications?
I am an avionic technician. My experience is mainly in heavy base maintenance on the Boeing 737, 757, 767 and 
777. I am in the process of applying for a B2 licence and I plan to apply for a B1 licence next year.
You recently competed in the WorldSkills Competition. What is it and how did you become involved?
The WorldSkills Competition is held every two years and is the biggest vocational education and skills excellence 
event in the world. It is designed to show off your vocational skills and compete against the best in your field. To 
qualify for the championship, in the aircraft maintenance category, I took part in the 2014 and 2015 Irish National 
Skills competition. I won the 2014 event and was invited to compete again the following year as a guest. After this I 
was selected to represent Ireland in the 43rd WorldSkills Competition in São Paulo, Brazil. From June to mid-
August 2015, I trained intensely at the Shannon training centre. The competition itself lasted four days. During that 
time, I competed in seven disciplines: sheet metal repair; flight control rigging; daily inspection of an aircraft; gas 
turbine engine borescope inspection and hot section inspection; gas turbine compressor inspection and blade 
blending and polishing; powered flying control unit removal, inspection, reassembly and rigging; and fabrication and 
installation of an electrical wiring loom and fault finding. It is an experience that I will carry with me always and I 
know that it has helped mould and mature me, both professionally and personally.
What does your job entail?
My day-to-day work, with Ryanair, includes routine and non-routine rectifications, servicing, inspections, 
troubleshooting, functional testing and especially avionic modifications. I am an avionic technician so the majority of 
my work is based around aircraft electrical systems.
No Headline In Original
Describe your typical day
At the moment I am working nights, so I will describe my typical night. I get up around 16:30 and leave for work at 
20:00. After a quick team meeting I get started on the modification – I am currently working on an avionic 
modification programme. The work consists of aircraft strip-out to get access for the new wiring, wiring installation 
and continuity checks, aircraft rebuild and, finally, function testing of the disturbed systems. I finish at 08:00 and 
after a quick snack and a chat with my wife I go to bed.
What are your ambitions?
I am in the process of applying for my B2 licence. Once I get my licence I want to become a certifying engineer on 
the aircraft. Later on down the line I would like to be involved with [the] training of aircraft maintenance technicians.
What activities do you do in your spare time?
I am currently working a four- days-on, four-days-off shift in England, so on my days off I am back in Ireland 
spending time with my wife and our puppy, going for walks or watching a film. I am a huge rugby fan, so I also try to 
watch as many matches as I can, especially Leinster and Ireland. n

Ryanair unveils new customer initiatives
Ryanair has announced plans for a number of new initiatives, including new business and leisure packages, 
simplified baggage options and a dedicated travel agency for school tours, as part of its 'Always Getting Better' 
programme aimed at improving customer service. 
The airline also plans to launch a 'My Ryanair' Club, which will offer 24-hour priority access to seat sales, and a top-
up facility which will allow customers to top up the accounts of friends or family as gifts. 
The airline, which will roll out the initiatives over the next year, said its load factor had risen to 92 per cent from 81 
per cent since the start of the programme two years ago. 
"The continued drive to improve our customer experience has been reflected in the record passenger numbers and 
load factors we have had over the past two years," said Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer. 
ICG snaps up high-speed vessel
Irish Continental Group has struck a multi-million dollar deal to acquire a high-speed vessel. 
The company announced last week that it had reached an agreement to purchase the Westpac Express from BALI 
Westpac 2006 for $13.25 million. 
Under the terms of the deal, title to the vessel will transfer to ICG on delivery which is expected by late May, the 
company said in a statement. 
The vessel was built in 2001 by Austal Ships in Australia. It has passenger capacity of 900 and a car carrying 
capacity of 182, according to ICG's statement.

FBD appoints new director
Insurer FBD has announced the appointment of a new chief financial officer. 
John O'Grady, a chartered accountant, will join FBD's board on July 1 as an executive director and chief financial 
officer. 
O'Grady will join FBD from Liberty Insurance, where he is currently finance director. He previously worked for Aviva 
and "its predecessor companies in Ireland in various roles between 1989 and 2013, including finance director, 
claims director and operations director", FBD said in a statement. 
O'Grady will take over from Paul D'Alton, who has held the role of interim chief financial officer since last October. 
Davy upgrades its economic forecasts
Davy Stockbrokers has raised its Irish economic growth forecasts, and now expects GDP to grow by 6 per cent this 
year and 4 per cent next year "due to the exceptionally strong momentum in the economy that has been maintained 
into early 2016". 
However, Davy also warned that the possibility of Brexit, along with political uncertainty at home, posed a threat to 
its forecasts. It had previously forecast GDP growth of 4 per cent this year and 3.7 per cent next year. 
In a research note, Davy economist Conall Mac Coille said that last year's exceptional growth rate of 7.8 per cent 
meant that even if the economy flat-lined, it would still expand by 3.3 per cent in 2016. 
Strong quarterly figures released by ISE
Total listings on ISE markets have grown to almost 34,400 securities from over 4,000 issuers in 80 countries, 
according to the latest quarterly statistics from the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE). 
The ISE figures indicated that equity trades reached record levels and turnover rose by 26 per cent, compared with 
the previous quarter. 
Among the global companies listing new debt instruments on the ISE during the first three months of this year were 
car maker Ferrari and telecommunications giant Vodafone.

Highlight: Ireland should slash personal tax rates to lure Russian oligarchs
Body
Tax avoidance by high-net worth individuals will continue unabated despite scandals like the Panama papers, 
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has said. 
"That will always be with us," he said. "Wealthy people can move. The wealthy people have the luxury of making 
those choices, and will." 
He said that Ireland should slash its personal tax rates in an attempt to lure high net worth individuals from London. 
"Why are all the Russian oligarchs and Chinese in London? It's because London is a very low-tax system if you're 
rich. Why doesn't Dublin do something like that, why don't we encourage them to come and live here in Dublin? 
Because, even though it's the intelligent thing to do, it's not politically attractive." 
He also predicted that tax avoidance by multinational companies would not be stamped out, despite moves by 
Brussels to clamp down on corporate profit-shifting. 
"The Europeans as usual, led by some idiots in France, believe: 'If we pass a law, we can tax them all here in 
France.' It simply won't work and it's why the French economy is in the complete toilet," he said. 
"It's the regulators coming around after the event and trying to close the stable door after the horse has bolted. 
Multinational companies will have no difficulty producing country-by-country accounts. They will tell you just as little 
as the multinational single set of accounts do now." 
The European Commission last week introduced new rules which could lead to companies with over (EURO)750 
million in revenue publicly disclosing information about what they earn, and how much tax they pay in individual 
countries. 
O'Leary: ' Irish politics depresses me'
On the subject of personal tax avoidance, O'Leary said that wealthy people would naturally gravitate towards 
jurisdictions which allowed them to reduce their tax bills. 
The tycoon was speaking at the launch of the re-election campaign of TCD Senator Sean Barrett, whose candidacy 
he is endorsing. "We have far too few sound, sensible economists in the Dáil and in the Seanad. As an electorate, 
we have a terrible record of electing every lunatic and halfwit who runs, and that's why the country is in the mess it's 
currently in. We need sensible people like Sean in the Seanad," he said. 
"I'm very depressed by the state of the political system here in Ireland, but it's not fair to blame the politicians. We 
should blame ourselves as the electorate," 
O'Leary, who was paid (EURO)1.75 million in 2014 and is fully tax resident in Ireland, said that proposals from Sinn 
Féin and other figures on the left for a wealth tax were misguided. 
"If they introduce a wealth tax, I'll be gone on the next Ryanair flight out of the country," he said. 
He criticised single-issue candidates as "not capable of running the country", and asked the electorate to "please 
vote for parties that actually have an economic policy and stop voting for the local bankrupt property developer, the 
local doctor or dentist or the local sanitary officer, because they're not capable of running the country".

Highlight: The brains behind Gigginstown is reluctant to share limelight
Body
Factfile
Age:54 
Appearance: quiet observer 
Newsworthiness: calls the shots at Gigginstown House Stud, which captured the Grand National last week 
Only an all-too-rare victorious Westmeath team could get the same reaction in Mullingar. Hundreds of cheering 
local people lined Austin Friar Street as Aintree Grand National winner Rule The World was paraded proudly by his 
owner, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary. 
Teenage jockey David Mullins was there. So too was Rule The World's hugely popular trainer Michael 'Mouse' 
Morris. O'Leary's mother Ger beamed proudly alongside the wider O'Leary family. 
But one person, without whom the marvellous victory could never have taken place, was missing. Michael's brother 
Eddie, racing manager - and so much more - at the aviation tycoon's Gigginstown House Stud, had gone straight 
from Aintree to the Newmarket "breeze up" sales. It was always business before pleasure for the O'Learys. 
     
Michael O'Leary's chequebook is so big he could probably buy every horse in the Grand National. But where's the 
fun in that? Instead, brother Eddie trawls auctions for raw talent that others don't see. 
Rule The World's Grand National victory, a day earlier, was the latest in a string of victories that has turned 
Gigginstown into a powerhouse of National Hunt racing. 
Profile Eddie O'Leary: The other O'Leary
Weeks earlier another Gigginstown horse, Don Cossack, had won the Cheltenham Gold Cup and Rogue Angel won 
the Irish Grand National. 
"Eddie is some judge of a horse, I can tell you," Mouse Morris tells this newspaper. "To buy one Gold Cup winner in 
a lifetime is very good. To buy two, and two Grand National winners, is effin' unbelievable. I wouldn't think anyone 
else has ever done that." 
     
Eddie O'Leary - one year Michael's junior - answers the phone. He is horrified as I explain that I am writing a profile 
of him on the back of the pivotal part he has played in his brother's Gigginstown success. 
"Oh no, no. Do the profile on him . . . I'm the silent one," he says in a stronger Westmeath accent than his brother's. 
I explain that we want to profile the real brains of the Gigginstown operation. He laughs. 
"Ah, every mug is lucky the odd time. Listen, we're having a good run at the moment, but runs tend to stop." 
People close to Gigginstown had told me that hard work over the last decade is only now paying off and well-laid 
plans are now coming to fruition. 
"Everything in this game is hopefully, hopefully, hopefully," says Eddie. "Things can go wrong so quickly. No More 
Heroes was our best young horse by a long way and we left him in Cheltenham." 
The horse was strongly in contention jumping the last fence in the RSA Chase, but slowed sharply. He had severed 
a tendon and was put down that night. 
 It wasn't the first time the two brothers had lost a horse. In 2001, having conquered the airline world, Michael told 
Eddie he wanted to "have a bit of fun". Eddie chose for him his first horse, Tuco. It won the Fairyhouse bumper. 
Two more victories followed and the elder O'Leary began to get a taste for it. But tragedy struck a year later at 
Fairyhouse. Tuco fell at the third-last fence and was killed. 
Eddie is philosophical: "We've been in horses all our lives, and unfortunately those things happen. It tends to be the 
good ones, because they go a bit faster." 
But his brother was devastated: "It was a big shock to Mike. He said that never again would his entire stream be 
wiped out in one day. 'Get me a few horses,' he told me." 
Eddie called to trainer Ger Hourigan, who had a horse that had caught his eye in a recent point to point. 
"He'd the race won easily but fell at the last. I watched the Cheltenham Gold Cup in Ger's house and then bought 
the horse. It was War of Attrition. The rest is history. If Tuco hadn't died, we wouldn't have got War of Attrition." 
St Patrick's Day 2006. The Gold Cup. Huge Irish crowds pack Prestbury Park, revelling as the Celtic Tiger enters its 
final days. Beef or Salmon, beaten in three previous Gold Cups, is favourite to finally bring home victory. War of 
Attrition drifts from 7-1 to 15-2 as the horses mill around the start. 
And they're off! War of Attrition, out wide, avoiding trouble. Forget The Past and Hedgehunter, both Irish, jostle for 
the lead. Four to go. Conor O'Dwyer, onboard War of Attrition, makes his move. Every jump perfection. Ruby Walsh 
on Hedgehunter battles back up the home stretch. The crowd erupts. War of Attrition holds on. It's a one-two-three 
for the Irish.Michael O'Leary and Gigginstown have arrived. 
"My brother Eddie bought this horse four years ago and always thought he had a chance . . . I thought he was 
dreaming," an overjoyed Michael says breathlessly, cameras clicking furiously. Four years later the Ryanair boss 
would pay emotional tribute to War of Attrition after it ran its last race at Punchestown: "Apart from the birth of my 
children, this horse has given me the best days of my life." 
Profile Eddie O'Leary: The other O'Leary
Eddie's advice to buy "staying chasers" - horses that race over three miles, or more over fences - had paid off. 
Such big, elegant horses - chosen as foals by Eddie, less for their pedigree than for what he saw in them - would 
become Gigginstown's calling card. A clear focus on buying horses to win the biggest races has helped to sustain 
the national hunt scene while other recession-hit owners crashed out of the game. 
So who's the boss, I ask Eddie O'Leary? "Oh, there's only one boss," he says, laughing. 
"It's Mike's hobby. People like Mike and JP McManus could easily be sailing yachts. But they have a hobby of 
racing horses and it's good for Ireland. It's not long ago since we had no winners at Cheltenham and every good 
horse was sold to England. It's fantastic for the country and for rural employment. Fair dues to them." 
Gigginstown is estimated to have about 200 horses, spread out across a large number of independently-run yards 
across rural Ireland. Recent estimates suggest that since 2010, Gigginstown has pocketed more than (EURO)13 
million in winnings. That may cover the cost of training the horses, but probably not the cost of buying them, 
although Gigginstown's finances are kept private. 
"There's no financial return whatsoever in jump racing," says one insider with knowledge of the Gigginstown 
business. "In flat racing, for the likes of Coolmore, it is all about residual value. A filly wins and becomes valuable as 
a mare for breeding. With jump racing, the horses are geldings and so have no residual value. 
"It's about the love of the game and nothing else. Prize money is never going to cover the costs. The horses are 
expensive to buy, expensive to train. It's a rich man's game." 
But Michael O'Leary, of all people, has no interest in throwing away money. He expects winners, and his brother 
regularly delivers. Eddie pores over auction catalogues deciding the value of young horses in which he sees 
potential. 
"At auction, Eddie's real expertise comes to pass," says the insider. "He has decided beforehand what a horse is 
worth and he stops right there if it goes higher. That's it. He knows exactly when to stop spending his brother's 
money. That's why it's successful. Loyalty and trust." 
     
The O'Learys grew up in Lynn Lodge, a fine detached home on Mullingar's Lynn Road. Their father Ted, originally 
from Kanturk, Co Cork, was a businessman who, along with wife Ger, moved to Mullingar in the 1960s. There, he 
set up a number of businesses, including a woollen business called Tailteann Textiles. 
Lynn Lodge was a hard-working place. There was little tolerance for slacking. Running your own business, rather 
than becoming an employee, was the aspiration. 
"It was before the PlayStation days," says Eddie. "We all had summer jobs. Kids didn't grow up with PlayStations. 
Mike actually worked as a barman for years, and I went towards the horses." 
After Clongowes, Michael joined KPMG, opened a sweet shop and revolutionised air travel. Eddie had very different 
ambitions. Uncle Noel O'Callaghan was building a hotel empire but it was the other O'Callaghan uncles, Tony and 
Gay, who both had built up large stud businesses, to whom Eddie gravitated. Ted O'Leary had owned racehorses 
and Eddie and his sisters were keen showjumpers and hunters. Eddie began spending much of his time at Tony's 
nearby Tally Ho stud, which focused on breeding, buying and selling yearlings for flat racing. 
"Tony kind of reared me," says Eddie. "He was a father figure. I spent all of my summers there, grew up with him. I 
was the horse-mad lunatic, Mike had the brains. It was always the game I wanted to be in." 
After Clongowes, Eddie went to Tipperary's Gurteen agricultural college, after which he built his own business 
buying mares and breeding flat racehorses. 
     
Profile Eddie O'Leary: The other O'Leary
Every morning at 6am, O'Leary is out with his horses at the 200-acre Lynn Lodge stud. It's a busy life, but he loves 
it. The opposite rhythms of flat and jump racing - summer and winter - allow him time to also manage his wealthy 
brother's hobby. 
And he has a new hobby himself, also built on winners. He and his wife Wendy travel Ireland and abroad following 
the athletic exploits of their talented 18-year-old son Jack, who begins a scholarship in Iona College, New York this 
year and has already run for both Ireland and Europe. Sixteen-year-old daughter Megan is on the Irish triathlon 
team. 
But apart from that, his responsibilities at Gigginstown and Lynn Lodge keep him very busy. Foals are bred at the 
farm for sale each autumn as yearlings at Goffs, Doncaster in England and Deauville in France. O'Leary also 
purchases yearlings and in the spring he sells them on at "breeze-up" sales in Newmarket, Kempton and St Cloud 
in France where young horses that have not raced are galloped over a short distance for prospective owners. 
The number of winners at racetracks around the world that have passed through his hands is proof of his well-
acknowledged good eye as a pinhooker. 
In 2013, O'Leary's stud hit the headlines in racing circles when it smashed the European record for the sale of a 
breeze up horse. O'Leary's operation had bought the Kentucky-bred colt in 2012 for $120,000, selling it a year later 
for 760,000 guineas ($1,215,999). 
"Eddie has a good eye," says one well-known horseracing personality who knows him well. "He knows the game 
and was well-regarded even before Michael decided to get into jumping. He knows what he is doing. 
"But with a strong budget to go along with a good eye, you're in business. Michael gives Eddie the confidence and 
the money to go and do it, and Eddie does all the right things. It's a powerful mix."

Highlight: Contrarian investor Damien Lanternier has increased exposure to a firm previously criticised for its 
reputational risk.
Body
Boutique veteran Damien Lanternier has rebuilt exposure to airline operator Ryanair after stating the Irish company 
has undergone a huge turnaround to become increasingly shareholder friendly.
Speaking to Citywire Selector, Lanternier said he reopened a position in the company in February in his flagship 
fund, the €1.49 billion Echiquier Agressor  fund.
Lanternier, who was previously subject of the Citywire Selector Performance Clinic feature, has seen performance 
improve and used recent market volatility to put capital to work in a number of ‘unloved’ areas.
The Paris-based investor previously had limited exposure to the company in his high conviction European equity 
portfolio, having previously championed opportunities in the aeroplane industry.
‘We are now seeing a surge in low cost carriers, which are also being aided by low oil prices and also this is sector 
which can grow secularly long term.
‘The reason we have focused on Ryanair is because it is low cost but also seeing its overall costs decreasing, while 
it is also showing strong expansion into the major transport hubs and not airports on the outskirts or far from major 
cities.’
 Lanternier, who would not divulge the size of the position, said Ryanair is showing strong and aggressive 
expansion plans in terms of buying new planes as well. He pointed to deal it has struck with Boeing for several 
hundred new vehicles.
‘This is huge compared to other levels of purchasing in the industry. In addition, they are set to take order of up to 
200 737s from Boeing in 2017, which shows future plans,’ he added.
Despite the influx of low cost carriers, Lanternier said Ryanair has retained its position as market leader and even 
begun to shed its unfavourable reputation.
‘They continue to be the cheapest operator and I think there is some room for improving yield, as well as recovering 
the poor reputation it previously had. Gone are the days of talking of charging for toilets and other schemes.

‘They have enacted an "Always Better" programme and the reputation is improving and I think that will surprise 
some people. It is still relatively cheap but generating a lot of cash and has become increasingly shareholder 
friendly as well.’
The Echiquier Agressor fund returned 26.4% in euro terms over the three years to the end of March 2016. This 
compares to a 24.3% rise by the FTSE World Europe TR EUR over the same timeframe.

Ryanair is to launch its first loyalty scheme in decades, introduce customer satisfaction surveys and allow "one-tap" 
upgrades using mobile phones as it extends its efforts to rid itself of a reputation for poor service.
The Irish low-cost airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, has seen profits and passenger numbers soar 
since Chief Executive Michael O'Leary announced in 2014 that he would stop "unnecessarily pissing off" his 
customers.
Since then the airline has slashed punitive fees for checking in bags and rolled out pre-assigned seating, flexible 
business fares and freshly brewed coffee on board.
After decades of refusing to contemplate the kind of reward schemes offered by other airlines, Ryanair on Tuesday 
unveiled "My Ryanair Club" which will offer customers discounts and free flights depending on how often they use 
the airline. Ryanair briefly offered a customer loyalty card before O'Leary took over as chief executive in 1994. The 
new scheme, which aims to entice people to save credit card data on their Ryanair phone apps, will offer customers 
one free return flight when they book 12 flights in a year and will make specific offers to customers depending on 
their travel habits. "We always said we would never have a scheme with cards and statements and all that 
administrative waste... But with big data each passenger can have their own (personalised) loyalty scheme," 
O'Leary told journalists, adding that this would avoid any significant additional costs. O'Leary, who has transformed 
European aviation with his dedication to a no-frills service, denied that his hand was forced two years ago by 
investors and fellow executives. Instead he said, a loss of customers to rivals such as Aer Lingus and easyJet 
made change inevitable. "We had locked ourselves into a position of, 'We're cheaper, nastier and we don't care'. 
But there were millions of passengers saying I don't care how cheap you are," O'Leary said. Once passengers 
agree to save their credit card information on their phone apps, Ryanair plans to launch "one-flick" purchases, 
mimicking the "one-click" purchases on Amazon.com. Customers will be able to pay for priority boarding, express

security checks and premium seats from their phones. The app will also offer airport transfers, parking tickets - and 
eventually tickets for local landmarks and concerts - using software that recognises the phone's location. EasyJet 
offers services such as free seat reservation, fast-track security and extra cabin bag to members who pay an 
annual fee. Ryanair customers will also be prompted to rate their flight to give the company instant feedback on 
areas where customer service remains weak. O'Leary credits the company's Always Getting Better customer 
service drive with lifting annual passenger numbers to 106 million from 80 million and shrinking its average 
percentage of empty seats per flight to 8 percent from 18. Ryanair's share price has doubled to over 13 euros from 
6.50 euros in late 2014. O'Leary, whose horse won the famous Grand National steeplechase at the weekend, said 
he had learned some humility. "Customers demonstrated by moving in fairly small, but significant amounts that we 
don't know it all - that I have still things to learn." (Reuters) Source: www.businessworld.ie

generation 737-800.
Body
"The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with its industry leading technical reliability and seating capacity, has been the 
foundation upon which our successful and safe growth has been built upon, since we took our first delivery in March 
1999," said Ryanair's Chief Operations Officer, Michael Hickey. "We are delighted to be now taking delivery of our 
400th 737-800, which includes the new Boeing Sky Interior and slimline seats, offering extra leg room and an 
enhanced customer experience, as part of our 'Always Getting Programme'." "A key factor in Ryanair's continued 
success is the outstanding economics of the Next-Generation 737-800," said Monty Oliver, vice president, 
European Sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. 
"This 400th 737 delivery is a special milestone for both our companies and we are honored that Ryanair continues 
to be an all-Boeing operator." Ryanair has more than 130 unfilled orders for Next-Generation 737-800s and is also 
the launch customer for the 737 MAX 200, the newest member of the 737 MAX family. The Dublin-based carrier 
ordered 100 737 MAX 200s, a variant based on the successful 737 MAX 8, that can accommodate up to 200 seats, 
increasing revenue potential and providing airlines with up to 20 percent better fuel efficiency per seat than today's 
most efficient single-aisle airplanes.

Britons in search of sea and sand are rediscovering the traditional western Mediterranean holiday, with bookings to 
Spain and Portugal up by a quarter so far this year.
Both countries anticipate record tourist numbers in 2016 after terrorist attacks placed destinations like Tunisia and 
Sharm el-Sheikh off-limits on Foreign Office advice.
The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) said there had been a clear shift and that bookings were being 
"funnelled into limited areas". They added that industry bodies elsewhere in northern Europe were reporting a 
similar trend. More limited options for holiday destinations combined with the recovery in household real incomes 
mean the industry has been able to maintain prices.
Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said that British households have more spare cash than they did; helped by 
cheaper food and fuel.
"In the past when this has happened, households have spent that windfall on holidays and cars. This, coupled with 
the weaker sterling exchange rate suggests to me that it is unlikely that anyone is going to find much of a bargain 
when booking a flight this summer."
Tourists turn to Spain and Portugal for sun and safety Travel
Analysts at HSBC estimate that EasyJet has hedged 86 per cent of its fuel requirement for this year, while Ryanair 
has hedged 95 per cent - meaning that further declines in the price of oil are unlikely to lead to cheaper flights this 
year.
Over half a million extra Britons have already booked to go to Spain or Portugal this year compared to last, 
according to the latest data from research agency GfK, which covers all of the big -traditional operators, including 
Thomas Cook, Tui, as well as lastminute.com.
As of the first week in April, over 40 per cent of British holiday bookings were for Spain.
By contrast, bookings to Egypt are down by 60 per cent, after the loss of a Russian jet led the Foreign Office to 
advice against all travel through Sharm el-Sheikh airport which is the gateway to many of the most popular beach 
resorts. Bookings to Turkey are also down by 35 per cent.
By the end of January, the industry had already sold more all-inclusive two week packages to Portugal than in the 
whole summer season last year, David Hope, director of the travel business at GfK, said.

OWNER Michael O'Leary wants to retire Rule The World after the injury-plagued nine-year-old defied odds of 33-1 
to win the Grand National on Saturday at Aintree.
Ryanair chief executive O'Leary fears that further outings could risk damaging a horse who has battled back from 
two pelvic fractures, but has vowed to leave the decision to trainer Mouse Morris.
"I would be conscious now having had a Grand National winner not to do anything that would endanger him or 
threaten him or run the risk of pelvic injury," said O'Leary.
"We'll sit down and think about it over the summer. If I had my way I'd like to retire him, but I think in this case we'll 
let Mouse decide what he wants to do and I know Mouse will make the right decision by the horse. If he wants to 
train him on next year, then we'll train on. If not, we'll retire him and look after him for the rest of his life."
Rule The World had never won over fences in 13 starts before his National triumph, while 19-year-old jockey David 
Mullins - nephew of trainer Willie Mullins - was competing in the race for the first time.
It was also a poignant victory for Morris, the Tipperary trainer who saddled Irish National winner Rogue Angel last 
month and was touched by tragedy last year when his son Christopher died in an accident.
"Watching the race, I thought we were going to be third and I was going to be very happy with that," Morris said. 
"From where I was watching it, I didn't really believe it until he passed the winning post.
"I'd say it's very unlikely he'll run again this year anyway. We'll let the dust settle and we'll see where we are after 
that. The horse won't be abused, that is for sure."

London Heathrow is set to face more competition in the battle among Europe's hub airports after Dublin airport said 
it would build a second runway by 2020.
As the UK government continues to postpone a decision on whether to build a third runway at Heathrow, the 
announcement by Dublin Airport Authority yesterday will fuel the debate over whether London's main hub airport 
risks being further sidelined by the delay as rivals move ahead with expansion plans.
The DAA's announcement comes a year after Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, was bought by International Airlines 
Group. IAG owns British Airways, and as part of its takeover proposal it promised new routes and more long-haul 
flights from Dublin, where Aer Lingus is one of the two main airline customers along with Ryanair.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive , said at the time that the addition of Aer Lingus would allow IAG "to develop our 
network using Dublin as a hub between the UK, continental Europe and North America, generating additional 
financial value for our shareholders".
A big attraction for Mr Walsh of buying the Irish carrier was the prospect that a second runway would be built in 
Dublin in the next few years, which he said was "inevitable".
Dublin runway move reignites Heathrow fears; Transport
IAG said yesterday: "One of the advantages of IAG is that we can expand the group's flights via Dublin or Madrid 
should there be no capacity increase in south-east England. A second runway in Dublin provides more opportunity 
to achieve this."
Planning permission for the project was granted in 2007 but its development was put on hold when Ireland entered 
a financial crisis in 2008.
The approval remains in force, and yesterday's announcement caps weeks of speculation that the airport operator 
would proceed with the development now that Ireland's economy has started to recover.
The DAA said the new runway would be 3,110 metres long and cost EUR320m (£259m). Construction would begin 
next year. The authority said its debt levels were "comfortable and the group has a strong liquidity position".
Kevin Toland, the DAA's chief executive, said the airport's existing runway infrastructure was operating at full 
capacity during peak hours.
Paschal Donohoe, acting Irish transport minister, said a new runway was "of major strategic importance to Ireland".

BUDGET airline EasyJet is expected to return to the red for the first half of the year after French air traffic controller 
strikes and the terrorist attacks in Belgium hurt traffic volumes in March.
The Luton-based budget airline said 611 flights were cancelled last month, blaming the majority on strike action in 
France.
Load factors - the proportion of seats taken up per flight - were down from 92.6 per cent to 91.3 per cent. And 
although overall passenger numbers were up 4.3 per cent compared to March 2015, this growth was well behind 
the 28 per cent increase outlined by Ryanair over the same period. Stephen Furlong, transport and logistics analyst 
at Davy Wealth Manage-ment, said: "We do not believe that the company will be profitable in the first half 
[September to March]."
EasyJet appeared to have turned a corner for the first half of the previous year, generating profit before tax of £7m 
during a period which was historically loss-making.
"The largest number of cancellations we have seen reported so far is Ryanair at around 500. Given that EasyJet is 
two-thirds the size of Ryanair, then it is [equivalent] to being almost double," said Furlong. He also pointed to the 
fact that EasyJet has a greater exposure to French destinations than its competitors.
Robin Byde of Cantor Fitzgerald was more conciliatory.
He said: "A lot happened in March. There was both the terrorist attacks and the French air traffic controllers strike.
"There is a lot of news flow today and it reads negatively, but you can't read too much into it."
EasyJet fails to take off after strikes and terror
Byde added: "Given the circumstances negative headlines are understandable. But overall the business model is 
resilient. It's a temporary issue and bookings will pick up."

       VIENNA (dpa-AFX) - European shares rebounded from a one-month low hit on Friday despite a mixed session 
in Asia and lower crude oil prices as doubts grew about the ability of big oil producing countries to agree on an 
output freeze.  Regional economic reports painted a mixed picture, with the Eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence 
Index coming in at 5.7 in April versus the 7 forecast by economists, while the euro zone's unemployment rate 
continued to slow in February to hit its lowest level since August 2011.  The U.K. private sector growth slowed to a

 The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.8 percent after losing 1.3 percent on Friday. The German 
DAX, France's CAC 40 and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 were up between 0.5 percent and 0.9 percent.   Banks traded 
mostly higher, with BNP Paribas, Societe Generale Group and Commerzbank rising between half a percent and 1.5 
percent.   Low-cost airline Ryanair rallied 2 percent in London after its March traffic grew by 28 percent.  Anglo 
American shares traded marginally lower, erasing early gains. The embattled miner has solid its 70 percent stake in

Body

opportunity for pilots to practice their manual handling skills in a relaxed environment. Atkins is providing 
multidiscipline services including; civil and structural, architecture, M&E and fire safety engineering. 
Design works where provided from concept stage through to construction including planning and tender stages. 
Atkins is also providing PSDP and assigned certifier roles. The new annex building which includes a link bridge to 
the existing Ryanair HQ will house the first of a new generation fixed base flight simulator. The building includes two 
new briefing rooms and a large open area in which the simulator will be located. Construction is currently underway 
on site and is expected to complete by the end of May 2016. Justin Norman, director, Atkins, said: "Atkins is 
delighted to be project designers for the new annex to house the simulator. We look forward to completing this

Ryanair yesterday called on the European Commission to take action to prevent the skies over Europe being closed 
by French ATC unions.
They claim that the European Commission's failure to prevent these repeated cancellations makes a "mockery" of 
the single European market and Commissioner Junckers claims about making Europe competitive.
Ryanair have also called on the European Court to reverse its previous rulings that EU airlines must pay out to 
passengers in such cases of ATC strikes which airlines have no control over and yet by law, cannot recover these 
sums from French ATC unions.
Ryanair's CMO Kenny Jacobs said, "It's time for the European Commission to act to protect the interests of 
Europe's passengers who are frequently held to ransom by the French ATC union. "You cannot have an effective 
single market in Europe but then allow a tiny French union to close down half the skies over Europe, causing 
hundreds of thousands of passenger flights to be cancelled ordelayed, when these passengers cannot be re-
accommodated because all other flights are heavily booked during the peak Easter holiday period." Source:

Airlines have lodged a formal complaint with European regulators over the $60bn market for spares and repairs on 
the world's 24,000 aircraft, as EU investigators intensify their preliminary inquiry into whether carriers are being 
forced to accept anticompetitive maintenance contracts.
Iata, the industry lobby group, sent a letter to the European Commission last week listing grievances such as 
requirements by engine and component manufacturers that airlines use only their spare parts for repairs.
Meanwhile Brussels is demanding further information from aircraft suppliers in a sign that it is deepening its informal 
inquiry into the maintenance and repair market. No formal investigation has yet been launched.
The preliminary probe, first revealed by the Financial Times last year, is focused on maintenance support for the 
CFM56 turbine and Rolls-Royce's Trent XWB engines, and for components including auxiliary power systems made 
by Honeywell.
Safran, the French engine maker, and CFM, its joint venture with General Electric of the US, are among those to 
have received a follow-up letter to a questionnaire sent to dozens of suppliers last autumn.
Rolls-Royce and Honeywell said they had not received a second request for information.
Aircraft repairers face probe over supplies Airlines
The rising costs of aircraft maintenance have been attacked by chiefs at British Airways, Air France, Ryanair and 
Lufthansa. Carriers complain that some original equipment suppliers are withholding repair information from 
qualified third-party maintenance shops, limiting competition and pushing up prices.
Limits need to be set on what equipment suppliers can define as intellectual property, the airlines say. That would 
open the maintenance market to a wider range of suppliers.
Brussels refused to comment beyond confirming that it was "closely monitoring competitive conditions as regards 
maintenance of engines and components for large commercial aircraft".
The maintenance, repair and overhaul market is set for robust growth over the next decade.
ICF International and Technavio, the aerospace consultancies, estimated that the market would grow from $60bn 
this year to more than $80bn by 2025.

Shares in European airlines and travel groups fell yesterday after explosions in Brussels raised fears about the 
threat of terrorism.
Ryanair and easyJet lost about 4 per cent following the blasts in the Belgian capital before recovering in the early 
afternoon. Travel groups InterContinental Hotels, Thomas Cook and Tui were also affected.
The attacks in Belgium came as Thomas Cook , the UK tour operator, warned in a trading statement that "the 
uncertain geopolitical environment is causing some customers to postpone booking their holidays".
It said people had grown cautious about spending their breaks abroad after terror attacks in previously popular 
destinations such as Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt.
Last month Thomas Cook said the attacks in Paris in November and a bomb blast in Istanbul's Sultanahmet Square 
in January were causing delays to bookings.
Peter Fankhauser , chief executive, said customers were taking more time to "consider their options".
Destinations such as Spain, the US and Cuba remained popular.

TRAVEL and tourism shares in Europe and the US were affected by events in Brussels, with stocks in American 
Airlines opening down almost three per cent on speculation its check-in desk was the target in the attack.
The stock closed down 1.63 per cent after the airline said its desk was not hit. European airlines broadly dropped by 
around two per cent, with Ryanair and BA owner IAG both hit. The Euro Stoxx 600 travel and leisure index fell by 
1.9 per cent, breaking a five-day winning streak. Thomas Cook, which warned ahead of the bombings that summer 
bookings would be down on last year due to recent attacks, closed down 4.3 per cent. "Consumer confidence will 
have taken another hit, adding to existing fears after attacks in Paris and Turkey. It's hard to see a near term 
recovery in a lot of these travel stocks," Wyn Ellis, travel and leisure analyst at Numis Securities, told City A.M. The 
pound slid against the dollar and euro by 0.9 per cent as investors feared the attack could increase the possibility of 
Brexit, fleeing to safe havens. The yen, gold, and government-backed bonds all rallied.

       VIENNA (dpa-AFX) - U.K. shares drifted lower on Tuesday after a suspected terrorist attack at Brussels airport 
this morning killed several people and left many more injured. Brussels airport has warned passengers not to come 
to the airport, which would be closed until further notice. 
 The focus is also on the inflation data, which showed that the U.K.'s inflation rate unexpectedly remained 
unchanged at 0.3 percent in February, far below the Bank of England's 2 percent target.  Meanwhile, a decision for 
the UK to exit the European Union would put the country's 'Aa1' credit rating at risk and would be credit negative for 
UK-based companies such as the auto, manufacturing, food and beverage, and service sectors, Moody's said.  The

Hotels lost 2-4 percent.   Thomas Cook shares plunged 5 percent. The holiday firm has reported a two percent dip 
in winter bookings and said that summer holiday bookings are lower than this time last year due to volatile market 
conditions.  Miner Anglo American edged down marginally after completing a bond buyback program.   Barclays 
tumbled 3 percent after Goldman Sachs lowered its price target for the stock.  Plumbing and heating products

       VIENNA (dpa-AFX) - European shares fell on Tuesday amid risk aversion after multiple explosions in Brussels 
left at least thirteen dead and thirty five injured.  Three were three explosions in Brussels, one at a subway station in 
the suburb of Maalbeek, while two explosions occurred at the city's airport. The terror threat in Belgium was raised 
to its highest level.  With investors rushing into safe-haven assets such as the yen, gold and government bonds, a

       BERLIN (dpa-AFX) - Last year's devastating crash of Germanwings flight 4U 9525 resulted in Lufthansa 
accelerating plans for the Germanwings brand to be integrated into the airline group's new budget airline, 
Eurowings.  By October last year, Eurowings had taken over over 55 Germanwings routes as part of its efforts to 
transform Eurowings into Europe third-biggest low-cost carrier.  Lufthansa plans to add several more Germanwings 
routes next month to Eurowings, which already handles all Germanwings sales. 
 However, Lufthansa's move to create a new budget carrier to compete with the likes of Britain's Ryanair and 
Ireland's EasyJet has been fraught with problems for the Cologne-based airline group.  Three years ago, Lufthansa 
decided to shift the lion's share of its domestic German flights to Germanwings as it attempted to cut costs and face 
up to fierce competition from European discount airlines and new Middle East-based international carriers.  But the 
switch to Germanwings - where pay rates are lower than other parts of the Lufthansa group - quickly ran into stiff 
opposition from both unions and pilots, triggering a series of damaging strikes by cabin crew and pilots.  Unit labour 
costs at Eurowings are 30 per cent lower than at the Lufthansa parent company, the airline said last week.  
Undeterred by the industrial action, Lufthansa stepped up its plans for a global discount airline by launching 
Eurowings' international operations last year.  However, the new global services have been hit by complaints about 
long delays in its services.  Lufthansa hopes to address the problem by expanding the Eurowings aircraft fleet this 
year by 10 to 98.  Despite the strikes and the March 2015 crash that overshadowed Lufthansa's 60th anniversary, 
the airline group last week reported a record annual profit.  Lufthansa said it booked a 55-per-cent surge in adjusted 
earnings before interest and taxes jumped to 1.82 billion euros (2 billion dollars) in 2015 from 1.17 billion euros in 
2014, with earnings boosted by a fall in its aircraft fuel bill and higher passenger numbers.  The Eurowings offshoot 
contributed to the annual result by posting an adjusted operating profit of 8 million euros in 2015.   Copyright dpa

BRITISH Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair cancelled several flights scheduled for yesterday and today as a result of a 
two-day strike in France.
Air traffic controllers are striking in protest against staff cuts, which industry union UNSA said are unrealistic due to 
the operational needs of control centres.
The French Civil Aviation Authority called for the cancellation of several flights for all airlines using French airspace.
A number of flights between the UK and France have been cancelled, and other routes across Europe have also 
been affected.
British Airways said: "Unfortunately in addition to cancelling some flights to and from France, other short-haul flights 
are also likely to experience delays throughout the two days, given how many flights would normally use French 
airspace."

BRUSSELS (AP) - The Cypriot pilot of the FlyDubai jet that crashed in southern Russia was going to quit the airline 
after recently accepting a job with Ryanair in Cyprus, a long-time friend said Saturday.
The friend told The Associated Press that pilot Aristos Socratous, whose wife will give birth to the couple's first child 
in a few weeks, wanted to raise his family in Cyprus despite a drop in his wages.
"The loss of income doesn't compare with being close to your family in your home country," the friend said.
The 38-year-old aviator was so looking forward to making a fresh start in Cyprus that he gave up his passion - his 
two motorcycles, which he used to drag race with, his friend said.
The friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he didn't want to be named discussing his friend's 
personal matters, said Socratous was an experienced pilot who had no complaints or problems with FlyDubai. He 
said Socratous was "very happy" about FlyDubai promoting him to full captain a year and a half ago.
FlyDubai CEO Ghaith al-Ghaith also called him an experienced pilot who had 5,965 hours of flying time.
Socratous, a graduate of the Oxford Aviation Training Center, had previously worked for Helios Airways, the Cypriot 
airline that shut down after one if its planes crashed in 2005. He had also worked for XL Airways and Malaysia 
Airlines.

Highlight: Pan-African group's shares decline as founder's public criticism escalates friction
Body
Fastjet shares plunged yesterday after a row between Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou and the pan-African low-cost airline 
escalated, with the carrier threatening legal action against its second-biggest shareholder.
The board of Fastjet warned it was taking legal advice after Sir Stelios, who founded the airline and holds a 12 per 
cent stake, wrote a public letter, reiterating concerns over whether the airline had enough cash to continue.
In a letter addressed to Colin Child , chairman of Fastjet, Sir Stelios on Thursday demanded the airline resume the 
publication of monthly passenger statistics and requested updated cash flow forecasts for the current financial year.
"We are worried that you might not be able to pay your debts in the next few months," wrote Sir Stelios.
He claimed that, by stopping the publication of passenger statistics in December, Fastjet had "potentially committed 
a breach of the current brand licence that exists between Fastjet and easyGroup Holdings".
Sir Stelios owns his stake in Fastjet via his easyGroup Holdings company, which is also the biggest shareholder in 
easyJet, the low-cost airline he founded.
On Monday, Fastjet announced that its chief executive, Ed Winter , and the airline's general counsel, Krista Bates , 
would step down following pressure from Sir Stelios, who has criticised the airline's "ridiculously high cost base".
Fastjet nosedives amid row with Sir Stelios Airlines
Last week, Fastjet's shares plunged 45 per cent after it warned that profits would be "materially lower" than 
expectations and said that it may have to raise extra funds. The warning came days after Sir Stelios voiced his 
concerns and proposed an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders.
The airline was set up to replicate the successful business model of European carriers such as easyJet and Ryanair 
by providing low-cost, no-frills flying for African travellers.
However, it has been badly hit by the weakness of many African currencies, as well as political turbulence in 
Tanzania.
Sir Stelios on Thursday also asked for further information about cash flow and ticket pricing to be made available to 
him on a confidential basis.
He warned that "failure to supply this information could give easyGroup Holdings the right to take back the Fastjet 
brand in order to prevent any further damage to its good name".
Fastjet and easyGroup have a brand-licensing agreement that dates back to May 2012. The agreement allows 
Fastjet to use the name in return for an annual royalty fee based on turnover.
The board of Fastjet responded to Sir Stelios by expressing its disappointment that easyGroup had made public Sir 
Stelios's letter "without first raising its concerns with the company".
It claimed it was "wholly inappropriate", adding that it would hold easyGroup responsible for any damage caused to 
the business by the publication of the letter.
Fastjet's shares fell 25 per cent yesterday morning but have recovered to trade at 31.42p, down 13 per cent on 
Thursday's close.

GERMAN airline group Lufthansa yes-terday forecast only slightly higher profits in 2016, despite lower fuel prices, 
warning of cut-price rivals and falling average fares as it ramps up its Eurowings budget business.
Like rivals Air France-KLM and British Airways owner IAG, Lufthansa benefited from low oil prices and strong travel 
demand in 2015, enabling it to restore dividend payments to shareholders.
However, low-cost rivals such as Ryanair and easyJet have also benefited and are challenging Eurowings, adding 
more seats in Europe, and especially Germany, and putting pressure on ticket prices.
Lufthansa said it expected a slight increase in profit for 2016 after reporting adjusted earnings before interest and 
tax of (EURO)1.82bn (£1.44bn) for 2015.
Before the update, analysts had on average predicted an increase in profit to (EURO)2.08bn. Reuters

WHEN the Colin Tizzard-trained THISTLECRACK finished fifth in last year's Imperial Cup, even his connections 
would have thought you mad for suggesting he would be favourite 12 months on for today's Ryanair World Hurdle 
(3.30pm).
Grade One wins at Aintree last season and Ascot in December have followed and the eight-year-old has improved 
at an extraordinary rate of knots.
His latest win on Trials Day here in January proved without debate that he's the best staying hurdler on these 
shores and he can be backed at 5/4 with Betway.
If there is one negative with my selection, it's the drying ground, as all of his best form this season has come on a 
bottomless surface.
That said, it wasn't soft at Aintree last season when he won the Sefton Novices' Hurdle, so it wouldn't be enough to 
put me off.
His biggest danger looks to be Irish-raider Alpha Des Obeaux, who fell at the last in that Aintree race when 
challenging Thistlecrack.
The drying ground will certainly bolster his chances and I've got the most enormous respect for anything his shrewd 
trainer Mouse Morris runs at this meeting.
Thistle can crack World Hurdle puzzle Bill Esdaile previews the World Hurdle and Pertemps Final
However, his form is quite simply not as good as Thistlecrack's and he was certainly coming off second best when 
he fell at Liverpool.
Last year's winner Cole Harden hasn't been in any form so far this campaign, but his trainer Warren Greatrex is 
adamant that better ground is key to him.
He was benefiting from a recent wind operation 12 months ago and I've also got it in my mind that he was given a 
soft lead.
At a much bigger price, I can see Paul Nicholls' Aux Ptits Soins going well, at around 16/1, but won't desert 
Thistlecrack on his biggest day.

Highlight: Ferry company and boss Eamonn Rothwell have turned Irish Ferries into the Ryanair of the seas
Body
Eamonn Rothwell is the last man you would want to play poker with, according to one business acquaintance who 
knows him well. 
"He is super smart. Super sharp. Always thinking two or three steps ahead." 
Rothwell has survived one of the most infamous industrial relations battles in Irish history, a failed management 
buyout attempt and economic calamity in his biggest market, yet still the company which he leads - and of which he 
owns 14.7 per cent - can lay out a set of financial results that can only be described as a flush. 
Results published last week showed that revenues at Irish Continental Group (ICG) jumped 10 per cent last year to 
(EURO)320.6 million from (EURO)290.1 million a year earlier on the back of increased passengers, lower fuel 
prices and currency fluctuations. 
The owner of Irish Ferries reported full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) of 
(EURO)75.5 million, up 49.5 per cent on the (EURO)50.5 million recorded a year earlier. 
So what is the secret behind the success? How has Rothwell built the Ryanair of the seas? 
     
Back in December 2013, Ireland's economic statistics were starting to look positive, and a very visual sign of that 
recovery sailed into Dublin Port: a huge new ferry painted in the colours of ICG subsidiary Irish Ferries. It was a 
sure sign that the Irish economy had found its pulse. But it also signified that ICG had moved on from a difficult 
period. 
The new ship, the Epsilon, was introduced onto the Dublin to Holyhead route in order to take a bigger slice of the 
growing market (it now also does a run to Cherbourg at the weekends). 
ICG continues to ship in the profits
Nevertheless, the Epsilon was an each way bet. It was a real sign that management was in the mood for growth, 
according to one source, but the Epsilon was chartered in rather than bought, enabling the company "to test the 
waters". That lease runs out at the end of this year. A key decision now faced by management is how to replace the 
ship, with sources suggesting that, although it has proven to be a hugely successful lease, it is also too small a ship 
for the company's expanding needs. 
"It is more likely that they will buy a ship," said one well-placed source, who, like most people who have dealings 
with  the famously media-shy Rothwell, has no appetite to see his name in print talking about ICG. "If you believe in 
the strength of the economy then you might as well take ownership of it and have your own ship rather than pay 
leasing costs to someone else." 
If Irish Ferries does opt to buy a new ship - which is likely to cost in the high tens of millions - that will be a very real 
vote in the long-term strength of the Irish economy, said the source. 
"There is plenty more growth to come in the Irish economy,"  he said. "Just think about the small number of houses 
we are building at the moment and the number that we are going to have to build. A lot of the materials and 
products that go in to building those houses will be shipped through Dublin Port on Irish Continental Group ships." 
ICG, with its stable cost base and high level of fixed costs, has the ability to turn this type of top line growth into 
profits very quickly and generate a lot of cash. The company has also benefited greatly from lower fuel costs. Unlike 
most of the airlines with whom it is in competition, Irish Ferries does not hedge and so gets the benefit of lower fuel 
prices more quickly than anyone else. 
The company finished the year with net debt of (EURO)44 million, but should have net cash of (EURO)6 million in 
2016. "But in terms of free cashflow, over the next couple of years the company is likely to make at least (EURO)70 
million and because the business is doing so well they are in a position to afford a ship without any real difficulties," 
said the source. 
In recent times, management have also been very smart in how they have bought and sold ships and other assets. 
In 2012, the company sold part of its container and terminal business, Feederlink. 
It also won a lucrative concession at Belfast port. Perhaps most impressive of all was the (EURO)24 million bargain 
deal in November to buy four container vessels for effectively the price of one, again boosting its ability to capitalise 
on the Irish economy. 
On top of that, smart financial planning that has seen the company balance cheap debt with generous share 
buybacks and dividends has been key to it driving up its share price inexorably. 
Industrial relations
There is, however, another, more troublesome factor in the success of ICG. Few companies in Ireland since 1913 
have managed to bring 100,000 people onto the streets. But Irish Ferries managed it during a bitter dispute with its 
staff that ran between 2004 and 2006. 
The company had attempted to pay some of its workers far below the minimum wage and had initiated a highly 
controversial redundancy programme for more senior staff as it attempted to radically alter its staffing profile to 
allow it become the lean business it is today. 
"The outsourcing was quite important to its subsequent success to ensure that it had a competitive cost base and a 
reliable team behind it so that it didn't face strikes and disruption," said a source. 
John B McGuckian, chairman, and Eamonn Rothwell, chief executive officer, of ICG Pic: Mac Innes Photography
But John Geary, professor of industrial relations and human resources at the Smurfit School of Business, said 
public reaction to the move "was quite phenomenal" and galvanised trade unions to seek better employment rights, 
collective bargaining and organisation among migrant, contract and peripheral workers. 
ICG continues to ship in the profits
"It certainly touched a raw nerve and as a dispute it stands out for me," he said. "It was amazing that a dispute 
involving one small section of a workforce in one small industry had the effect of bringing so many people out onto 
the streets. A lot more than when we were confronted with the troika and the most severe economic crisis." 
While Geary said he would be reluctant to make a value judgment, he believes employers like ICG ultimately face a 
clear choice: compete on the basis of low wages and the undermining of conditions of employment and customer 
service, or compete on higher wages but better customer services. 
"Irish Ferries took the option, quite distinctly, of following the original Ryanair model on the sea. Imposing that 
model of low wage competition put it in direct confrontation with its workforce. It's not for me to endorse that or not 
and it can be spun in a variety of ways," said Geary. 
Patricia King, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, who was part of the Siptu negotiating team 
at the time, roundly condemns the approach Irish Ferries took. 
"I remember being in a room one night with management and it was very fractious. They were questioning what it 
was we were looking for. I remember taking (EURO)7.65 in change out my purse, which was the minimum wage, 
and throwing it on the table. 'Count that,' I said, 'that's what I want for every one of those workers for every hour 
down in the hold of that ship.' It was bareknuckle stuff." 
But what would King say to an analyst who argues that what ICG did in terms of rationalising its workforce was 
essential to keep it in business, to allow it survive the recession and to thrive in the recovery? 
"Yes, well, that type of analysis is something you would hear from someone who just looks at figures and who 
doesn't include human beings in the equation at all. It is the analysis of someone who merely sees a company as a 
vehicle to make profits and to be money spinners. It is one way of looking at it, but the people who deliver that for 
you are human beings." 
In the end, the company was forced to back down on its plans and ended up paying out (EURO)6 million in 
redundancies. And yet, the figures would suggest that ICG lost the battle but won the war. In 2007, it paid out 
almost (EURO)33 million in employee costs. By last year, despite expansion, that was down to (EURO)21 million. 
Blue chip investor base
So what comes next for the company? Soon after the industrial dispute was dealt with, a takeover battle kicked off 
that saw Rothwell lead an ultimately unsuccessful management buyout attempt. 
With the property market in a state of insanity, management found themselves up against developer Liam Carroll, 
as well as One 51 and the Doyle Group. ICG had moved from being a ferry company to a property player based on 
its holdings around Dublin Port. But the property crash soon put paid to those notions and it remained a plc. One 
person with close knowledge of the internal workings of the company said the "steady as she goes" approach will 
continue for the foreseeable future. 
"I don't see an MBO at this company, for example. It now has a blue chip investor base that is not in a selling mode 
but looking for incremental growth. Clearly there was potential for an MBO a few years ago, but that is gone and it 
certainly looks like remaining as a public limited company for the foreseeable future." 
Nevertheless, in the medium term, some change is inevitable given that Rothwell, who owns almost 15 per cent of 
the company, is almost 60. There have been a number of new appointments to the senior management team in 
recent times. 
"I am sure that is part of a long-term succession plan. But from what I can see, Rothwell still has a huge appetite for 
the business so I don't see anything changing any time soon. There's no obvious number two just yet. This is a bit 
like Ryanair: there's a number one and there's a number one." 
ICG continues to ship in the profits
At Ryanair, longtime deputy chief executive Howard Miller never got to succeed O'Leary in the way that many 
thought he would. 
Rothwell, too, has outstayed senior executives whom some might have seen as natural successors. 
But while there are many comparisons between the two companies, ultimately ICG can never truly be a Ryanair of 
the seas given that it is likely to remain very reluctant to expand out of its Irish market. 
"That puts a cap on how much it can grow, in a sense," said a source. "But then while some companies want to 
keep on growing, others are happy to stay at a reasonable size and be very profitable." 
Storm clouds on the horizon for ICG
ICG may well be proving to be a runaway success but there are potential storm clouds on the horizon. The sharp 
rise in fuel costs that some economists are predicting could turn ICG's lack of hedging quickly into a disadvantage. 
A weakened sterling, which could make Ireland less attractive to British visitors and hit Irish exporters to Britain, 
could also dampen the strong growth the company has seen in freight. 
If Brexit comes about, the company's passenger profile - with 60 per cent inbound into Ireland from Britain - could 
put it under some pressure, particularly if the British economy and sterling were to take a kicking. 
"The company does not seem overly concerned about Brexit. You have to suspect that, whatever happens, there 
will probably be some sort of trade agreement between Ireland and the UK," said a source. 
There is also - potentially - a silver lining for the company from Brexit if duty free were to be brought back in. In the 
good old days, Irish Ferries made huge money from so-called booze cruises, with half the company's profits 
generated by duty free sales. The return of duty free on the Irish Sea following a Brexit would be an obvious boon, 
while the more likely establishment of a new free trade zone would mean business as usual for ICG, analysts have 
recently pointed out. 
Indeed, most analysts have sharply increased their earnings predictions for the company, regardless of Brexit or oil 
price hikes. Those predictions are based on the fundamental fact that across every metric, the company continues 
to outperform its competitors. 
And if there is one thing that is certain, Eamonn Rothwell will continue to play his ICG cards very close to his chest.

Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, is capturing market share quicker than expected in Germany, an 
executive told Reuters on Friday.
Ryanair, which is expanding routes out of Cologne and Berlin in particular, ended 2015 with a 5 percent share of 
the German air travel market and expects that to rise to 8-10 percent this year, Kenny Jacobs, chief marketing 
officer, told Reuters on the sidelines of the ITB travel fair in Berlin.
"Michael has said we'll get to 20 percent within a five year period but so far we're ahead of that projection," he said, 
referring to Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary.
Ryanair is also not ruling out flying out of Frankfurt in the future, if it could get the right deal, Jacobs said. O'Leary 
has often said Frankfurt was one of the few airports Ryanair could not fly out of due to high fees and lengthy 
turnaround times. "It's a possibility," Jacobs said, although he added that Ryanair did not need to fly from Frankfurt 
or Munich, Germany's two largest airports, to reach the 20 percent market share target. In Germany, alongside 
Berlin and Cologne, Ryanair is targeting smaller airports such as Nuremberg and speaking to businesses in the 
area such as Adidas and Audi to inform its route decisions, part of a trend for budget carriers to target corporate 
travel. Jacobs said while the German market was currently underserved by low-cost carriers, Frankfurt and Munich 
would eventually have to increase the amount of low-cost flights to reflect growing demand for budget across 
Europe.. "For a country that gave us (discount supermarket chains) Aldi and Lidl, to have the lowest penetration of 
low-cost airlines, it's quite a surprise," he said. (Reuters) Source: www.businessworld.ie

Ryanair is casting aside its no-frills image with the launch of a corporate-jet service that promises leather reclining 
seats and fine dining catering.
The service, launched yesterday, will see the Irish low-cost airline delve further into the lucrative business market 
by appealing to companies and wealthy individuals who prefer travelling by private jet.
The airline has kitted out a Boeing 737-700 aircraft for hire with 60 business-class reclining leather seats, with a 48-
inch pitch - providing much more legroom than Ryanair's normal 30-inch configuration.
It represents a significant departure from the airline's normal approach, which has seen it upend the business 
model of Europe's flag carriers for 30 years by undercutting them on fares with its no-frills service.
Ryanair said the corporate-jet hire will be charged by the hour, and available for flights to destinations up to six 
hours away. But in typical Ryanair fashion, customers will have to pay extra for add-ons such as fine dining. "This is 
the perfect vehicle to bring government traffic or companies who want to be seen as saving money by flying Ryanair 
but still get to enjoy all the opulence of corporate travel," said the airline.
The jet, while still branded Ryanair on the outside, will be devoid of the airline's typical yellow and blue interiors. 
Ryanair has spent the past two years revamping its image after admitting its no-frills approach could "piss people

off". After two profit warnings in 2013, the carrier overhauled its business model, reduced or axed unpopular fees 
and let passengers take a second, smaller item of carry-on baggage. It is also flying to more primary airports and its 
website has been upgraded to make it easier to book tickets.
In 2014, the airline made its first foray into the corporate market by offering a "business class" service on all of its 
flights. Branded "Business Plus", tickets start from EUR69.99 and allow unlimited flight changes and premium 
seating. According to Ryanair, it flies more than 25m business travellers each year.
It says it plans to start with one corporate jet to assess the market before considering whether to add more.

LOW-COST carriers could take up to a 25 per cent share of the market for transatlantic travel, the chief executive of 
Icelandic budget carrier Wow Air told Reuters yesterday after it made its first annual www.profit.No airline has so far 
had a major success with low-cost long-haul travel between Europe and North America, although companies such 
as Wow Air, Norwegian and Lufthansa's Euro-wings are all active in the market now. Wow Air, founded in 2011 and 
offering flights to Washington DC and Boston from Europe from (EURO)247 (£191) one way, made its first profit of 
around 1.1 billion Icelandic crowns (£6m) in 2015, against a loss of 600m crowns in 2014.
Skuli Mogensen, CEO and founder of Wow Air, said people had become used to low-cost flying and online ticket 
sales, one of the ways budget carriers seek to keep costs down.
"It's all about the timing," he said.
"You don't have to explain the lowcost model anymore. Everyone has flown with easyJet or Ryanair.
"Historically, 99 per cent of the transatlantic market has been controlled by what I call the legacy cartel. I am 
confident the low-cost carrier model can capture up to 25 per cent."

Highlight: Pan-African carrier eyes funds as key shareholder urges board's replacement
Body
Fastjet shares closed 36 per cent lower yesterday after the pan-African low-cost airline warned that profits would be 
"materially lower" than expectations, and said that it may have to raise extra funds.
At one stage in the morning shares in the Aim-listed carrier were trading 45 per cent lower at 36p , having closed on 
Friday at 67p. The slump comes just days after the company received demands from its second-largest shareholder 
for the board to be replaced.
In its third profits warning in the past year, Fastjet said it expected results for 2016 to be "materially below market 
expectations" and warned "the group no longer expects to be cash flow positive for the year".
It said the challenging market conditions "have been a lot more prolonged than management originally forecast". 
The company said it was monitoring its cash position "very carefully", but with more than $20m available at the end 
of February, it said it had sufficient funds to meet its operational requirements.
Nonetheless, Fastjet said it was considering raising further funds to "provide additional headroom and ensure the 
company has the necessary resources to fund future growth as market conditions improve".
Fastjet shares plunge on third profit warning; Airlines
Last week, easyJet founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou , Fastjet's second- largest shareholder, tabled a request for an 
extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, calling for Ed Winter , the chief executive, and Krista Bates, a board 
director, to be replaced.
EasyGroup, Sir Stelios's private investment vehicle, said it was using its rights as a 12 per cent shareholder to call 
for an EGM, adding that it had "lost faith" in the management and current board, and warning that "unless the board 
does some serious cost-cutting the company will soon run out of cash".
Sir Stelios criticised Fastjet's "ridiculously high cost base", claiming that Mr Winter had "burnt some £80m in the last 
three years". He wrote: "We now have about six months left to steady this ship. Time is of the essence."
Mr Winter, who has run the company since it was founded in 2012, said in January that he was stepping down as 
chief executive but would remain in his post until a replacement was found.
The airline was set up to replicate the successful business model of carriers such as easyJet and Ryanair, by 
providing no-frills flying for African travellers.
It flies from five airports in Tanzania and has flights to Johannesburg, Lusaka, Harare and Nairobi. In January it 
announced new routes between Zimbabwe and South Africa. However, it has been badly hit by the weakness of 
many African currencies. Since the start of 2013, shares have dropped 98 per cent.

DALLAS (AP) - JetBlue Airways is taking applications for 24 slots in a new program to train novice pilots to fly a 
passenger jet.
The airline said Monday that the program - the first of its kind at a large U.S. airline - will cost about $125,000 and 
take four years to complete. Graduates could wind up flying 100-seat passenger jets.
Warren Christie, JetBlue's senior vice president of safety and training, say the program won't replace the airline's 
traditional pipelines for pilots, many of whom come from smaller airlines. JetBlue hired more than 300 pilots last 
year, and a group of 30 new hires just started training last week, he said.
Applicants will be judged with tests measuring hand-eye coordination, multitasking, critical thinking and other skills. 
Those who survive the first cut will be interviewed.
There also will be a "personality assessment" but not psychological screening, Christie said. The debate over 
psychological screening has increased since a Germanwings pilot intentionally crashed a plane last year in France, 
killing 150 people.
JetBlue expects the first group of six prospects to begin training in late summer at the airline's training center in 
Florida. JetBlue hired CAE, a maker of flight simulators, to provide the training. CAE has run similar programs for 
EasyJet and Ryanair in Europe and several airlines in Asia.
Christie believes the program will open the profession to more people. The trainees will meet all federal 
requirements before carrying passengers, he said.
"They will absolutely be as qualified as any other pilot that is operating a JetBlue aircraft," he said.
Taking a page from programs in Europe, the students will start training with other crew members in a cockpit or 
simulator much earlier than usual, according to JetBlue and CAE. Currently, some new U.S. pilots learn by dusting 
crops or toting advertising banners - experience that may bear little resemblance to working in an airliner cockpit.
JetBlue 's trial approach: Will train novices to be pilots
The applicants will pay for their own training, and the cost is not much different from the amount that many aspiring 
pilots now spend to accumulate the 1,500 flight hours necessary for an airline pilot's license.
Christie said the students will be able to defray some of their costs by earning a salary as a CAE instructor for part 
of their training period. CAE described the salary as "competitive" without providing specifics.
Nick Leontidis, president of CAE's training business, said students who struggle will be flagged for remedial training 
and, failing that, expulsion. But washout rates in similar programs at other airlines have been "extremely low," he 
said.
"We believe this is going to be an important part of how airlines are going to create pilots in the future," Leontidis 
said.
The pilots' union at JetBlue pilots opposes the plan. Jim Bigham, chairman of the union's council, said JetBlue 
should instead hire pilots with experience at regional airlines who currently get passed over.
Bigham said he is not against training newcomers to the field, "but when they come out, I want them to go gain 
some real-world airline experience prior to becoming an apprentice at JetBlue."

Bumper traffic at Ryanair
Ryanair's February traffic grew 28 per cent to 7.4 million customers, up from 5.8 million last February. 
Its load factor rose four points to 93 per cent, from 89 per cent last year. Meanwhile, rolling annual traffic to 
February grew 17 per cent to 104.6 million customers. 
Ryanair spokesman Kenny Jacobs said: "These record monthly numbers and load factors are due to our lower 
fares, our stronger forward bookings and the success of our Always Getting Better customer experience 
programme, which continues to deliver better than expected traffic and load factors." 
Last week, the airline launched its Belfast winter 2016 schedule. There are seven new routes to Alicante, Berlin, 
Krakow, Lanzarote, Malaga, Milan and Tenerife, and extra flights to London Gatwick. 
Profits up at Dalata to (EURO)28.5 million
Hotel group Dalata has reported a pre-tax profit of (EURO)28.5 million for last year, up from (EURO)4.2 million in 
2014, in what it described as a "transformational" year for the company. 
The company said revenues grew by 185 per cent to (EURO)225.7 million following the integration of 15 new hotels 
into the company. 
"2015 has been a remarkable year for Dalata," said chief executive Pat McCann. 
"The results for 2015 highlight the momentous change that the group has undergone as a result of the acquisition of 
15 hotels." 
Dalata said its pipeline for new opportunities remained very strong and it expected to fully invest its remaining 
(EURO)130 million this year. 
Boardroom Briefing
Strong results from CRH after billions spent on acquisitions
Building materials company CRH last week reported sales of (EURO)23.6 billion, 25 per cent ahead of 2014. 
The company's results statement highlighted "good profit growth" and an "enhanced portfolio through mergers and 
acquisitions". CRH made acquisitions and investments of almost (EURO)8 billion in 2015. 
It reported a jump in pre-tax profit, which increased from (EURO)761 million in 2014 to (EURO)1,033 million last 
year. 
Chief executive Albert Manifold said that "as a result of good performance from our heritage businesses and 
contributions from acquisitions, 2015 was a year of significant profit growth for CRH". 
Total Produce looks to further investments
Revenue at Total Produce increased by 10.4 per cent to (EURO)3.45 billion in 2015, according to results published 
by the company last week. 
Company chairman Carl McCann said it had "delivered a very strong performance in 2015", pointing to its growth in 
North America via a number of acquisitions it made last year. He added that the group "continues to actively pursue 
further investment opportunities". 
According to analysis by Davy Stockbrokers, Total Produce "retains significant financial flexibility". 
Smurfit Kappa makes London move
Smurfit Kappa shares began trading in sterling on the London Stock Exchange last week, the company's first step 
in a move toward having a full primary listing on the London exchange. 
The paper and packaging group's shares will continue to trade in euro in Dublin. Last month, the company 
confirmed it was "reviewing the listing arrangements" for its shares. 
In a statement released at the time, Smurfit Kappa said it remained "committed to retaining an Irish Stock Exchange 
euro-denominated listing, which will continue to provide access to a wide range of international investors". 
The week ahead
Tomorrow, Irish Continental Group will publish its 2015 results. Last week the company announced the appointment 
of a new director, David Ledwidge. He joined the company in 2006 and was appointed chief financial officer last 
year. 
Tuesday will see the newly merged betting giant Paddy Power Betfair publish results, while Permanent TSB will 
publish full-year results on Wednesday (see Ian Guider's Market Talk column on page 3).

THE ADVERTISING watchdog has ruled that travel comparison site eDreams has been misleading cust-omers 
through its Google advertisements.
The Advertising Standards Auth-ority has been looking into customer complaints after Ryanair claimed the website 
was duping those who belie-ved they were booking directly with the airline.
The budget Irish carrier has also called on search giant Google to remove eDreams from its promoted search 
listings, but says this has been ignored.
Ryanair's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said: "Google is clearly aware of this misleading advertising, 
because Ryanair has brought it to its attention at every level within the organisation.
"We believe that Google has thus far failed to block this misleading advertising, precisely because it boosts 
Google's advertising revenues by actively misleading consumers into believing they are booking tickets on Ryanair 
and/or other websites when in fact they are booking on a third party website."
In Germany Ryanair won a case forcing Google to remove eDreams from results.

       MOUNTAIN VIEW (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair (RYA.L, RYAAY) said it welcomed today's ruling by the U.K. 
Advertising Standards Authority, which found that eDreams advertising on Google was 'misleading' consumers and 
breached the CAP code.   Ryanair called on Google to ban this deceptive eDreams advertising until such time that 
eDreams stops misleading consumers by passing itself off as Ryanair.  The U.K. ASA reviewed a series of 
complaints from consumers who were deceived by eDreams masquerading as Ryanair and Easyjet using the 
airlines name, brand and logo in a blatant attempt to dupe consumers into booking higher priced tickets on 
eDreams than those available on the Ryanair.com website. 
 Ryanair believes that Google has allowed this advertising, which the ASA now confirms breaches the CAP code, 
because it directly boosts the number of 'click-throughs' on Google's paid for advertising search engine, thereby 
maximizing Google's advertising revenues at the expense of consumers.   Ryanair noted that it has repeatedly 
written to Google at the highest levels, including Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, enclosing hundreds of 
complaints by real customers who have been misled by eDreams false advertising on Google, and yet Google has 
failed/refused to take any action to prevent this deceptive advertising.  Meanwhile, a statement from an eDreams

Highlight: After a spate of issuances in 2015, the UK carrier becomes the latest airline to tap the European capital 
markets. Jack Dutton reports.
Body
US investors make up the lion's share of aviation capital markets deals but, over the past year, an increasing 
number of airlines have been tapping the European capital markets.
In December, Norwegian opened up its investor base after issuing its debut eurobond. In March 2015, Ryanair 
returned to market with its second eurobond, with a coupon of 1.125%, setting a record for the aviation industry. 
With a strong credit rating of Baa1/BBB+ stable, it was easyJet's turn to step up to the plate.
"I think we have been able to price a transaction that's captured the attention of the market," Brendon Moran, global 
co-head of corporate origination, debt capital markets at Société Générale, tellsAirfinance Journal.
The banker, who worked on the bond, explains why.
"One reason for this is its success, in what have been incredibly tricky markets that have been and remain quite 
difficult to read," he says. "We had continuing weakness going into this deal throughout January, particularly in 
equity markets, andI think fixed-income markets looked a little bit shaky."
The UK low-cost carrier's offering is a seven-year bullet repayment with a coupon of 1.75%, payable annually.The 
initial price expectations were 165 basis points (bps) to 175bps over seven-year euro mid-swaps, but the bond 
priced at 147bps over mid-swaps.
The mandated lead arrangers were Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays and Société Générale.
Allen & Overy acted for the arrangers and Herbert Smith Freehills acted for the airline.
Soaring investor demand
The road show for the bond took place in the second week of January, during which the airline visited cities in 
Europe, including London, Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Paris and Munich.
Analysis: easyJet closes â,¬500m debut eurobond
"EasyJet went through a formal road show, meeting with fixed-income investors across the continent in the areas 
where you find big pockets of liquidity for corporate bonds. They got out there, on the back of having their ratings 
announced "" Baa1/BBB+ stable "" which is always a good story to show," says Moran.
The airline opened the book on February 2. It received a soaring oversubscription of just over â,¬5 billion ($5.5 
billion), which was reduced to â,¬4.8 billion after price tensioning.
The book included about 400 investors from France (23%), UK and Ireland (21%), Germany (21%), Luxembourg 
(9%), Italy (7%), Nordic countries (5%), Switzerland (7%) and other European countries (7%).
The proceeds from the bond will be used to pay back £182 million ($257 million) of existing commercial debt 
maturing this financial year. Proceeds will also be used to finance new aircraft deliveries.
Pipeline of issuance
"We intend this to be a pipeline of issuance. We can see ourselves coming to market every 12 to 18 months, at a 
similar size, provided the economics still work for us," Mike Hurst, group treasurer at easyJet, tellsAirfinance 
Journal.
He adds: "What's driving that requirement is the 20 to 30 new Airbus aircraft that we've got arriving per annum over 
the course of the next four to five years."
EasyJet's incoming Airbus aircraft include both A320ceos and A320neos. The Ceos are delivering now and the 
Neos will begin delivering in 2017.
According to Hurst, one of the main tenets of the Moody's report that underpins easyJet's credit rating is the 
carrier's move towards bringing new aircraft onto the balance sheet unencumbered. As at September 30 2015, 
easyJet had 241 aircraft, 114 of which were unencumbered "" 47% of the carrier's fleet.
"And obviously this is a strategic move to open up a source of unsecured funding, so when new aircraft come onto 
the balance sheet,the number of unencumbered aircraft grows over time. This is one of the key pillars of our credit, 
and it is why we have been able to obtain the credit rating we have with Moody's," says Hurst.
He adds: "What drives these sort of deals is the credit quality. To really do this well, you have to have a solid, 
investment-grade credit rating, which we do. If you look at where the rest of our peer group are in terms of credit 
rating, there are relatively few who could achieve this. Many airlines quite frankly, don't have the credit quality to be 
able to issue unsecured at this size in these markets at this level of pricing."

LONDON'S bachelors really outdid themselves this weekend. While six members of a stag party were kicked offa 
flightfrom Luton forbeing drunk and unruly, a well-heeled bachelor staying in the city managed to blow over £10,000 
on his last night of freedom.
Our spy tells us that a well-heeled stag booked a private room at Angels last weekend for a most unusual bachelor 
party.
Although the mysterious stag invited his best man, the only other guests to the party were 30 female friends and a 
few of their boyfriends for a night of harmless debauchery.
Peter Stringfellow himself conceded it was "one of the best stag nights I've seen in any of my clubs."
The troupe, which could only be described as having "aristocratic" backgrounds, managed to spend well over 
£10,000 on the stag's big night out, but a group of British bachelors may be spending their own behind bars, and 
ending up even more out of pocket, after being arrested by German police for drunken loutishness. Six men who 
were detained on a Ryanair flight to Bratislava on Friday evening for becoming rowdy and aggressive with security 
on board are now facing fines of up to (EURO)25,000 (£20,000) each. Police officers at Berlin's Schoenefeld airport 
charged the men with misdemeanours under the German aviation security laws after pilots on the flight were forced 
to make an unscheduled landing so the stags could be detained. The bridegroom was among those detained, 
according to police reports.
We know where we would've rather been.

Highlight: Head of Britain Stronger in Europe denies campaign is weighted towards London
Body
Stuart Rose used to tempt journalists with goodies from Marks and Spencer, but these days all he has are biros 
inscribed with "Britain Stronger in Europe".
Five years since he stepped down from the British food and clothing retailer, Lord Rose now occupies a sixth-floor 
office at Bridgepoint, the private equity firm which he advises, and has a portfolio of board positions, including the 
chair of Ocado, the online super-market.
Dressed in a - clearly - far more expensive suit than the trademark M&S number he used to sport on results day, he 
is also heading the campaign for Britain to remain in Europe , with its unfortunate BSE acronym.
The aura of plush capitalism surrounding him has given ammunition to Eurosceptics who claim that the London 
establishment has lined up in favour of the status quo, to the detriment of "ordinary people".
Lord Rose rebutted the criticism. "This [campaign] is not Londoncentric, this is something that everybody is 
engaged in," he said.
Although several senior businessmen, including British inventor James Dyson, Anthony Bamford of JCB, and 
Helena Morrissey of Newton Investments, have spoken out in favour of leaving the EU, the two main Out campaign 
groups lack a figure of the stature of Lord Rose.
In camp is a broad church, says former M&S chief Interview: Lord Rose
In the past two weeks, not a day has gone by without more businessmen signing up for the In campaign.
Last week, these included Richard Branson, Michael O'Leary of Ryanair and Carlos Ghosn, head of Nissan. On 
Tuesday, 198 business people, including the bosses of 36 FTSE 100 companies, signed a letter to The Times in 
support of remaining in the EU.
Lord Rose said the number of business people contacting him to ask for information on Brexit, "in order to reach a 
position", has gone up "exponentially" in recent weeks as BSE looks to hit the £7m of funding that the Electoral 
Commission permits.
"We have had contributions from big business, from financial services businesses, from medium-sized businesses 
and from, dare I put it this way, the man in the street," he said. "As Tesco would say, without being too trite, every 
little helps."
He refrained from attacking the disorder of the two Out campaigns , locked in internecine warfare as they jostle to 
be anointed as the official group.
"I've noted the sort of disarray that the other side seems to be in. Frankly, I'd rather that they got themselves 
organised and we did have a proper opportunity to engage with the people who are putting the counterargument. 
"We need to have a campaign which is represented by strong teams on both sides."
He must be relieved, though, that the campaign has finally moved from the "phoney war" of the past few months - 
when "we were busy under the water, paddling like mad" - to a clear date for a referendum .
One senses that he must be glad the date is sooner rather than later, and that the campaign can finally "move up a 
gear" since, for him, this will mean an end is in sight.
There is no doubt that Lord Rose is very committed to Europe, in part because of his personal background - a 
globally peripatetic childhood, a Russian father and a mother who was part-English, part-Scottish and part-Greek.
He says he feels British "first and foremost", but that he has "never not felt European".
But he has his finger in many pies, and it is easy to sense his impatience to return to his normal globe-trotting 
business role, out of the public spotlight.
"I expected that when I took on the job [as BSE chair], that it [would] become more time-hungry as time goes on. I'll 
do what I can do, but I am mindful that my first priority is I've got other commercial responsibilities," he says. "I'm a 
businessman. I'm not a politician. I'm not remotely a politician."
Media concerns
Bosses reluctant to speak up for fear of backlash
Some business leaders are refusing to come out publicly against Brexit because they fear being lambasted in the 
British newspapers, corporate figures have claimed.
"One of the reasons business leaders fear speaking out [on Brexit] is because of how they are treated in the press," 
said the chief executive of one major multinational firm.
The businessman, who refused to give his name, said many business people did not want to be derided or mocked 
by Eurosceptic rightwing newspapers.
Lord Rose, who chairs Britain Stronger in Europe, the In campaign, said that business leaders had become more 
cautious during the "tumult" of the last decade given the financial crash and recession.
"I think there has been, to an extent, a little bit of demonisation of business," the peer said.
In camp is a broad church, says former M&S chief Interview: Lord Rose
"People are probably a little bit more thoughtful about speaking up than they used to be."
Opinion polls suggest that trust in executives has fallen since the credit crunch. Ipsos Mori recently found that 
business leaders were trusted by only 35 per cent of those surveyed, coming 20th out of 24 professions.
Last week Downing Street displayed a letter from business chiefs supporting the In campaign, with only 36 
signatures from FTSE bosses, down from 80 who had been expected to sign.
David Cameron, asked why so many had not signed, admitted that companies were often reluctant to "make any 
form of political statement".
John Redwood, the former Tory cabinet minister, recently vowed that companies that spoke up for EU membership 
would pay a "very dear economic and financial price."  Jim Pickard and Sarah Gordon

Highlight: What should I do with my lump sum?
Body
What should I do with my lump sum?
Question: I have a sum of around (EURO)25,000 to invest. What would be a good investment for three to 
five years? I am unable to decide between a managed fund and shares in two or three of the bigger 
companies, such as Kerry, Ryanair and so on. They seem to have been doing well over the past year or so, 
but I have no way of knowing what the future may hold for them. What would you suggest?
Patrick, Galway 
Answer: Patrick, thank you for your letter. 
First off, I'd suggest that you take care investing in individual shares, as that is quite a risky play. You don't mention 
in your letter what other investments you have, so perhaps you'd see those shares as forming part of an overall 
balanced investment portfolio. However, if individual shares would be your only investment, proceed with caution. 
Key to figuring out where to put your money is deciding what your investment objectives are and how much risk you 
are willing to take on. 
You mentioned that you want to invest for a three to five-year time horizon. Do you need the money for a specific 
purpose at the end of the five-year period, or would you be prepared to invest for longer? Also do you need access 
to your money over the next five years? Think about the level of liquidity you might need in the coming years. 
According to Jonathan Sheahan, managing director of Compass Private Wealth, individual shares are "far too 
volatile". "It's not something that I'd recommend for someone that's not a seasoned investor," Sheahan said. Once 
again, your approach on this depends on your investment objectives and your attitude to risk. 
Ask Emma
Taking a portfolio approach, whereby you invest in a wide range of asset classes, is one option worth considering. 
This could be done via a fund, as you suggest. In Sheahan's view, anyone with below (EURO)100,000 to invest 
should consider multi-asset funds, which are typically designed with varying risk levels on offer. Investing in this 
way, he said, allows investors with smaller sums to invest to "benefit from economies of scale". 
"Those sort of lifestyle funds are based on levels of risk. You could, for example, go for a 'middle of the road' fund 
risk-wise, and switch if your appetite for risk changed." 
Bear in mind that you will face fees if you invest in a fund. "You can generally expect an annual management fee of 
1 to 1.5 per cent," Sheahan said. 
He said that the fee structure will "depend on what you want", with greater liquidity, for example, coming with higher 
fees. "Someone, say, who is prepared to lock in their money for longer might possibly benefit from a lower 
management fee," he said. 
The consumer website of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), ConsumerHelp.ie, 
provides advice on various investment options, with information on the fees you might face. 
It recommends carefully examining the fees and charges before investing in a fund. "They can significantly reduce 
the value of your investment, especially the charges that are ongoing and are based on a percentage of your 
investment," it warned. "These have a bigger impact because the charge itself gets bigger the more your 
investment grows." 
Also bear in mind that higher fees do not correlate with better performance. "Different investment products may 
have higher charges, but this is no reflection on how well they will perform," the CCPC website warns. 
Patrick, good luck with your investment decisions. I hope this advice helps as a starting point. Before making any 
big decisions, I'd suggest getting some more detailed advice. Perhaps talk to an independent financial adviser who 
can discuss your investment choices in the context of your broader personal financial circumstances.

Aer Lingus-owner IAG forecast a more than 900 million euros or 40%profit rise this year as Chief Executive Willie 
Walsh said he planned to steer the group towards further growth.
IAG, whose portfolio also includes British Airways andVueling , will this year benefit from lower fuel prices, a long-
term strategy of reducing costs and growing demand for travel.
But the company faces uncertainty in the shape of volatile currencies, Britain's June vote on leaving the EU, and 
pressure on ticket prices from increased competition in Europe and on transatlantic routes.
Walsh said IAG was well positioned to grow in spite of those headwinds. "Clearly it will a challenging environment 
but the good news is that we're very confident in terms of our performance," he told reporters on Friday. The 54-
year-old, who once said he would retire at 55, is also planning to stick around to oversee that growth for at least 18 
months. "I'll still be 55 until October of 2017, until my 56th birthday, so there's still time for me," he told BBC radio. 
The forecast of 40% growth in the current year represents a slower pace than the 65 percent jump in operating 
profit it reported for 2015. That guidance puts it on course to post a result of 3.2 billion euros, slightly behind the 3.4 
billion euro consensus forecast according to Reuters data. IAG stock initially spiked to its highest in more than a 
month in reaction to the results, before trading down 2.9% at 543 pence by 1025 GMT. Like many European 
airlines, IAG will this year be helped by an oil price which has almost halved over the past 12 months, as long-term 
fuel hedges fall away allowing more of the benefits to be felt. The challenge for IAG is to retain the benefits of 
cheaper fuel amid pressure on ticket prices from operators such as budget airline Ryanair. Recent falls in the pound 
on uncertainty about the outcome of a referendum on Britain's EU membership are also a risk to IAG because its 
major expenditure is on fuel, priced in dollars. As for the vote itself, Walsh said that outcome would not affect IAG. 
"We don't believe it would have a material impact on our business," he told the BBC. (Reuters) Source:

(RTTNews) - Budget airline Ryanair's (RYA.L, RYAAY) CEO Michael O'Leary is advocating for Britain to stay in the 
European Union.
O'Leary has warned that the Irish Airline will cut investment in Britain and might increase flight prices if Britain 
leaves the EU bloc.
Prime Minister David Cameron has set June 23 as the date of the referendum to determine if Britain remains a 
member of the European Union.
However, if "Brexit-- Britain's exit from the EU-- happens then Ryanair will invest more in European countries such 
as Poland and the Czech Republic, O'Leary said.
Ryanair Cheif said the carrier will actively campaign for Britain to stay in the EU by running newspaper ads that 
promote EU membership and also posting pro-EU slogans on Ryanair planes.
"We'll be getting involved in the debate and trying to influence people to vote in favor of Europe because the UK 
economy and UK jobs are better off in Europe," O'Leary said.
More than 35 million passengers per year use Ryanair flights to travel between the U.K. and Europe. Ryanair 
expects 20 percent of its passengers to depart from London airports this year.

Michael O'Leary , chief executive of Ryanair, has urged the British public to vote to stay in the EU , warning that an 
exit would create huge economic uncertainty.
The outspoken boss of the Irish low-cost airline said he would "bore everyone to death" by campaigning over the 
next few months. Ryanair is also planning adverts detailing the benefit for UK travellers of staying in the EU.
Mr O'Leary said the EU's policy on deregulation and competition had driven down the cost of air travel over the past 
30 years and that the public had more to fear from UK bureaucracy than European regulation.
"The campaigners who believe that Brussels bureaucrats are terrible and British bureaucrats are some of the most 
fantastic forward-thinking gurus . . . they can't make a decision on a runway to save their lives . . . and the only 
impact they've had on air travel over the past 10 years since Gordon Brown is to raise taxes on aircraft," he said.
Mr O'Leary said any future rise in air fares was likely to result from UK government policies such as air passenger 
duty. "What will really drive air fares up over the next five years is APD. If the UK economy is stalling post a Brexit, I 
think APD is one of the things [the UK government] will raise."
Ryanair joins airlines urging public to vote to stay in EU Industry campaigners
Ryanair is not the first airline to warn on the impact of leaving the EU. Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet, is 
campaigning against Brexit, while the chief executives of Heathrow , Gatwick and Stansted were among the 
business leaders that signed a letter on Tuesday backing David Cameron's reform deal.
Mr O'Leary's comments were made as Ryanair disclosed plans to expand its London traffic by 10 per cent, taking 
the number of its customers to 23.6m.

Ryanair have today called for a 'Yes' vote in the European referendum on 23 June.The airline have claimed that 
some of the benefits of low fare air travel for British consumers have been eroded by Government regulation 
including UK APD travel tax and the EU's failure to deliver its single sky project.
Ryanair say they are critical of both UK and EU Government for failing to promote low fare tourism growth in areas 
such as the UK travel tax, however, they remain a committed supporter of the UK remaining in Europe.
Ryanair believe that EU membership means more UK jobs and better economic growth. They also believe that 
foreign inward investment in the UK will be lost to Ireland and Germany if the UK leaves Europe.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary today commented, "As the UK's largest airline, Ryanair is absolutely clear that the UK 
economy and its future growth prospects are stronger as a member of the European Union than they are outside of 
the EU. "Leaving Europe won't save the UK money or red tape because like Norway the UK will still have to 
contribute to Europe, and obey its rules if it wants to continue to trade freely with Europe, so it's clear that UK voters 
should vote Yes to Europe and Yes to the reformed Europe, that David Cameron has delivered." Source:

       LONDON (dpa-AFX) - A group of more than 100 leaders of major businesses on Tuesday backed Prime 
Minister David Cameron's campaign for Britain to remain in the European Union, saying a British exit, or Brexit, 
would 'deter investment and threaten jobs.'  'Business needs unrestricted access to the European market of 500 
million people in order to continue to grow, invest and create jobs,' the business leaders said in a letter published in 
the Times. 
 'We believe that leaving the EU would deter investment, threaten jobs and put the economy at risk,' the letter read.  
The nearly 200 signatories included top executives from 36 companies listed on London's FTSE 100 index.  Among 
the companies represented are Airbus UK, British Telecom, BP, Diageo, EasyJet, Goldman Sachs International, 
GSK, HSBC, Rio Tinto, Rolls Royce, Royal Dutch Shell, Ryanair, SABMiller, Siemens Manufacturing, Standard 
Chartered, Virgin Media and Vodafone.  'The businesses we lead represent every sector and region of the UK,' they 
wrote. 'Together we employ hundreds of thousands of people across the country.'  Cameron's deal with the 27 
other EU leaders last week means 'Britain is better off staying in a reformed European Union,' they added, 
highlighting agreements to reduce bureaucracy, deepen the single market and pursue international trade deals.  
The Confederation of British Industry, which represents some 190,000 businesses, has also backed Cameron, 
praising the EU reform package as 'a major step forward.'  Britain will conduct a referendum on June 23 on whether 
or not to remain part of the EU.  Eurosceptics inside Cameron's ruling Conservative party have provided the 
strongest support for the 'leave' campaign.   Copyright dpa

Highlight: Memories of 2008 and a rough start to the new year are making investors wary, but there is value out 
there for those prepared to take a risk,  writes Ian Guider
Body
What's going on? The question on the mind of every investor since the beginning of the year. 
We have witnessed the worst start to a year for global markets since the Great Depression in the US in the 1930s. 
Such has been the battering stock markets have taken, that we are now in bear market territory, having reached all-
time highs just last May. The capitulation has seen government bond yields fall to record lows as investors shove 
their money into safer assets. Credit default swaps, which investors buy to protect themselves, have soared, as has 
the price of gold.  
It has been brutal and punishing, with the casualties mounting up.  
The price of oil seemingly doesn't know where it will settle, its plunge below $30 a barrel has caused chaos, not just 
for the major oil companies which are seeing their profits wiped out, but for countries whose revenues are 
inextricably linked with its fortunes.  
In China, the communist government has been so spooked by slumping stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen 
and the slowest rate of growth in its economy for two decades that it has been forced into extraordinary actions to 
prevent the situation getting worse. 
Across Europe, fears are mounting that banks, still sitting on toxic loans from the 2008 crash, may face difficulty 
repaying bondholders. Their shares are not just back to levels seen then, but to prices last recorded in the 1990s. 
Even in America, with its jobless rate falling to under 5 per cent in recent months, everyone is nervous. Shouldn't 
workers' earnings be rising faster with such a low unemployment rate? Why are company earnings so anaemic? 
Was the Federal Reserve's decision in December to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years the worst 
possible timing? 
Invested: Crisis or the curse of total recall?
Closer to home, the turmoil has begun to bite. The Irish stock exchange, one of the best-performing in the last few 
years, has gotten off to a rough start. The banks have taken a big hit as have household names including Paddy 
Power, Ryanair and CRH. The declines on the Iseq are double those experienced by London's benchmark Ftse100. 
This sell-off has been a long time coming. Since 2009, fuelled by the unprecedented money printing, or quantitative 
easing, by central banks, markets have been on a run that saw most American, European and Asian indices reach 
all-time highs even as the global economy has struggled to achieve any type of meaningful recovery.  
The money unleashed has chased returns. It has gone into equities, emerging markets, commodities, private equity 
and everything else to make up for low sovereign bond yields. It may also have created the monster markets now 
face. 
"There are fires going off in every market around the world. It is an extension of what happened in 2007 and 2008. 
For me it's not a separate crisis, it is the same crisis re-evolving in a different manner," said Paul Sommerville, 
founder of Sommerville Advisory Markets. "People are saying this is a China slowdown story or an oil story. For me 
they are just some of the effects. There is way more to this than a simple sell off." 
Nick Bullman is founder and chairman of CheckRisk, a company that advises pension and investment funds around 
the world. He believes that events are now beginning to spill over into the real economy. 
"The sentiment has just been appalling and is probably worse than the fundamentals. But that being said, all the 
major markets have broken through the September lows and from a technical perspective, that is very bad news. 
The slowdown in China got people going. And that moved on to the weakness in the oil price that rather than being 
something that would stimulate the economy, it's a signal that demand is very weak. The feedback loop from weak 
oil is that a lot of European banks have effectively taken all of the money from quantitative easing and put it into 
emerging markets, commodities and oil companies," he said. 
The volatility itself is causing investors concerns. The gyrations up and down daily are getting worse and it is 
flummoxing even the savviest of experts. Mohamed El-Erian, one of the best known financial commentators and 
chief economic adviser to Allianz, took to Twitter to express his views. "While a relief, Dow's 200 plus point surge in 
less than ten minutes is adding to the general sense of confusion and in security in markets," he tweeted, in the 
wake of one particularly turbulent trading day in February. 
What has also exacerbated the concerns was the view that heading into this period, many stocks were trading at 
very high earnings multiples. As corporate earnings disappointed in the last couple of quarters and with investors 
bidding up some big-name tech stocks, it is worsening the scale of the declines. LinkedIn, for example, lost a third 
of its value in a day when its earnings came in below estimates. 
According to some commentators, what we are experiencing right now is directly the result of the very medicine that 
was given out to resolve the 2008 crisis. 
"People will blame speculators and traders. It is not. It is absolutely central bank policy that has caused a huge 
bubble in all asset prices and they are readjusting," said Sommerville. "My view is that the markets have been in an 
induced coma triggered by the central banks and they are waking up to the negative consequences of quantitative 
easing and central banks' failure to manage monetary policy. And the engine of all this is the US economy is just 
not performing the way markets were told it was performing. They have created their own bubble and that has to 
deflate to get back to normal market." 
John Mattimoe, head of equity analysis at Dublin-based fund managers Appian Asset Management, believes that 
so far the economic data we've seen, at least out of the US, has not been as bad as some fear.  
"In the last set of jobs data, not only had you the reduction in unemployment, but the first acceleration in terms of 
wage growth and in terms of number of hours worked. That is encouraging," said Mattimoe. 
Invested: Crisis or the curse of total recall?
Even in Europe, where the influence of the debt crisis is still lingering, there are chinks of light. Last year, the 
eurozone economy expanded by 1.5 per cent, although Greece remains in recession. Germany grew by a little 
stronger than the average at 1.7 per cent, but that disappointed. What analysts can't tell yet is how quickly all of that 
will change as a result of what is happening in markets.  
And what should investors do? The turmoil has frayed nerves. It is a brave person who decides to make a call on 
whether we've hit bottom.  
"We have reduced our equity recommendation from overweight to underweight for the next three to six months. 
People should be neutral or risk-off and if there is a rally they should be selling into it," said Bullman. 
Mattimoe saidAppian had been steadily reducing its allocation to equities for the last two years because it felt 
company valuations were getting too high. It had cut its equity holdings to about 35 per cent, he said.  
Still, for those who are prepared to dip their toe back into stock markets, there may be a chance to pick up 
companies with more realistic valuations. 
"In terms of people who are longer-term focused and want exposure to real assets, what is becoming more 
apparent now is that with equity markets off by a mid-teen rate you are seeing pockets of value. It is a sensible 
strategy to stagger in, rather than going in in one swoop," he said. 
How do markets prevent the calamities of 2008 repeating themselves and just who can step in to end the crisis? 
Ironically, the world is turning back to central banks for action once again.  
Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairman, told US lawmakers in February that it was closely monitoring 
conditions in financial markets and would respond if there were signs of doing damage.  
The Fed had set a course of hiking interest rates as many as four times this year. That is now highly unlikely and 
Yellen admitted that reversing course to move to negative interest rates was a possibility, albeit a remote one at this 
stage.  
The European Central Bank is set to expand its programme of asset purchases in order to get banks lending again. 
Its president Mario Draghi has spent a year printing (EURO)60 billion a month and has promised whatever it takes 
to kickstart Europe's ailing economy.  
Nick Bullman, though, doesn't see an easy way out of the quagmire. 
"There has been $62 trillion of new money created since 2008 and the only way you escape the weight of that is to 
have global [gross domestic product] growing at 3.5 per cent or inflation picking up and we've seen no sign of that," 
said Bullman. 
But there are those whose faith in policymakers and the action they have taken since 2008 is unshaken and leads 
them to believe there are tools still available to halt another recession.  
"Time and time again, policymakers have shown themselves to be bolder and more inventive than asset markets 
give them credit for," Steven Englander, a strategist at Citigroup, said in a research report to clients.  
Among the things that could be put on the table are tax cuts, with central banks using their firepower to buy 
government bonds to pay for them, he wrote. 
However, Paul Sommerville said: "Many people are expecting the Fed to reverse course. I don't think they will be 
able to do that. I think it would be a worse signal to the market." 
Mattimoe believes missteps from the main global central banks are the biggest risk to some sort of stability.  
Invested: Crisis or the curse of total recall?
"It is down to Draghi continuing to convince people he is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep the eurozone on 
a direction to a gradual recovery. In the US, it is the balancing act so that if the threats are high, the Fed won't move 
too prematurely, and if you are seeing growing domestic inflation pressure, the Fed won't wait too long [to raise 
interest rates]. There is a real worry if you get currency weakness out of China, whether devaluation or letting [their 
currency] peg go, that could have implications for devaluation across the global economy. 
"In terms of possible upside, you have got to take some recognition that we are in a zero [interest] rate world and 
that there is no return available on risk-free assets. So that provides liquidity for real assets when value does 
emerge.  
"The second issue is the US consumer because the employment picture is beginning to get the firepower to make a 
material contribution to growth."  
So has the negativity and fear been overdone?  
For all the gloom, the actual economic data has been benign. The US is pretty much close to full employment, 
Europe for all its woes is growing. For canny investors prepared to take a risk, there is value out there.  
However, the painful memories of 2008 and all that followed are etched into the minds of many. That we are only a 
few years out from the great recession makes what is happening, the swiftness at which events are occurring, very 
familiar.  
Are we doomed by the response that policymakers set in train with their unprecedented quantitative easing and the 
addiction of markets to the cheap money? Nobody knows. And that is making it all the worse.

Lower fuel bills and continued cost-cutting helped Air France-KLM to its first annual net profit for five years, sending 
its shares up 10.6 per cent.
The Franco-Dutch airline, which is 16 per cent owned by the French government, reported a net profit of EUR118m 
for 2015, against a loss of EUR225m the previous year.
The return to the black comes as it continues to battle trade unions as well as increased competition from 
aggressive Middle Eastern and budget rivals.
Air France-KLM has been fighting to reduce costs, which are high compared with low-cost carriers such as easyJet, 
which operate on short-haul routes, and fast-growing Gulf airlines such as Emirates. It has struggled to implement 
its full cost-cutting programme, demonstrated most publicly by a violent confrontation with executives at an 
employee meeting last year. The group has already announced a reduction of 1,000 jobs for this year.
Alexandre de Juniac , chief executive, insisted that the airline needed to push through further cost cuts. "Yes we 
have seen improvements and we are now in the black. But our competitors have also shown an improvement and 
there is still a gap," he said. "We have to be at the same level of our competitors . . . so to do that, we have to lower 
our costs."
Air France - KLM plans more cost cuts despite first annual profit in 5 years
Analysts pointed to the airline's weak profitability, with operating margins of 3.1 per cent compared with Ryanair's 
18 per cent. Gerald Khoo, analyst at Liberum, said: "2015 represented progress against a very weak benchmark."
The company gave no profit forecast for 2016 but warned that fuel savings would be offset significantly by negative 
currency effects and pressure on unit revenues as rivals added capacity.
Net profit fell in the fourth quarter to EUR276m from EUR308m the previous year, with revenues down by an 
estimated EUR120m because of the terrorist attacks in Paris in November.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the full year were EUR2.5bn, up from EUR1.6bn a 
year ago. Revenues rose 4.6 per cent to EUR26bn on the back of higher passenger numbers.

Is the airline bull-run taking off or losing altitude?
Is the airline bull-run taking off or losing altitude?

Over the last 18 months, airlines have been a major beneficiary of the falling oil price. A slump in jet fuel has 
expanded margins to unprecedented levels, but these could be in danger as ticket prices look set to move lower. Is 
the airline bull run coming to an end?
It's hard to make money in airlines or it used to be. In the 100-odd years the industry has existed, it has been a 
'death trap' for investors, according to Warren Buffett. Yet things have been different for several years and the 
sector has made backers a significant return.
Ryanair shares are up sixfold since 2008 lows, EasyJet fivefold, and British Airways owner International 
Consolidated Airlines Group has more than doubled since late 2011.
Historically, it was hard to make money as the sector has a high cost base, making the marginal gain on each 
additional passenger very small. If an airline cannot fill most seats it is easy to make a loss.
It is these high fixed costs that make margins so thin. According to the International Air Transport Association 
(IATA), the industry net profit margin in 2014 was just 2.3%, an improvement on 2013's 1.5%.
Margins are forecast to rise in 2015 to 4.6% and 5.1% in 2016, boosted by oil. IATA has used an average price of 
$55 a barrel for 2015 and $58.6 a barrel in 2016: should it stay at current levels (and assuming airlines haven't 
overcautiously hedged), it is possible margins could be even higher.
However, ticket prices are also expected to fall and this is a real threat to margins. Ryanair said recently that prices 
between January and March were expected to fall an average of 6%, ahead of its previous expectations of 4%.
With margins being so thin, they could evaporate completely. 'We expect the lower fare environment to continue for 
the foreseeable future, with some respite during the summer months,' said Ryanair chief executive, Michael 
O'Leary.
There has been a lot of investment in aircraft and extra capacity is expected to exceed growth in passengers. 
Increased competition could threaten yields, with price cuts and rising labour overheads paring the positive of lower 
fuel.
So what is the outlook for the main UK-listed airlines?
Is the airline bull-run taking off or losing altitude?
International Consolidated Airlines Group (-14% over the year to date)
The owner of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling has seen its shares fall the furthest this year because 
it is very exposed to transatlantic routes, which tend to be hit hard in a slowdown.
This is particularly significant as British Airways is expanding transatlantic capacity in the mid-single digits. If there 
is a slowdown and a resultant slide in demand, ticket prices are likely to come under pressure.
The company is also planning to rapidly expand its low-cost carrier Vueling, which could trigger significant 
competitive pressure from rivals easyJet and Ryanair.
Positively, management have turned around Iberia. There is scope for material upside in margins at the carrier and 
potential synergies from the integration of Aer Lingus.
EasyJet (-9%)
EasyJet has employed a successful strategy of targeting market share gains from legacies at major airports. 
However, as capacity is rising, yields could come under pressure from price cuts.
Here, easyJet is at a disadvantage to main competitor Ryanair, as the fees of its primary airports tend to be higher. 
The company's strategy of winning over business customers from struggling full-service rivals has worked well.
This has been helped by the launch of allocated seating and by pushing into major airports that business customers 
tend to favour. EasyJet's management has been very shrewd at selecting routes and managing capacity, and 
added lucrative Alpine ski destinations.
Ryanair (-4%)
Ryanair has benefited from being nicer to its customers, evidenced in its recent profit upgrades, the latest in 
September. The European short-haul market remains buoyant and the company has the dominant share at 15%. It 
has a very efficient operational structure and low costs, helping it benefit from structural changes in a market where 
larger carriers are reducing short haul capacity. Any derailment in the eurozone recovery could hit shares hard.
Of course, the main threat to all three would be a sharp rise in the oil price, which would dampen sector sentiment 
and hit margins. Excluding this, airlines will be able to make the most of heady margins. Any spike in the oil price 
would be a signal to take profits.

International markets remain nervous but Irish banks sparkle

Highlight: Janet Yellen's testimony to Congress was especially unsettling
Body
Despite the stock market rebound on Friday, international markets remain nervous following Thursday's rout, which 
reinforced the major declines across all of the main market indices since the start of the year. 
Aside from continuing concerns about China - not helped by the lack of transparency and confidence in its official 
figures - Janet Yellen's downbeat testimony to Congress- (including hints of a possible move to negative interest 
rates) was especially unsettling for financial stocks. 
Despite rising employment and real wage growth, it suggested that the Fed chairwoman had underlying concerns 
about the health of the US economy. Negative interest rates undermine bank profitability and this, combined with 
continued weakening in the oil price, has heightened market concerns about the adequacy of bank capital. 
The significant share purchase by JP Morgan chief Jamie Dimon steadied market nerves on Friday. This was 
despite similar director share purchases in their banks back in 2008, having proved subsequently to be a false 
signal of soundness. 
But despite these international trends, Irish bank shares have sparkled since early February. Bank of Ireland and 
AIB shares were up by 20 per cent, performing strongly contrary to international market trends. This is despite the 
uncertainty about the outcome of the general election and its implications for economic stability and the constraints 
on the banks' mortgage lending.  
Clearly, enough investors see value and are confident that the banks can continue to strengthen their earnings with 
the write-back of bad debts and increased personal and SME loan demand from a strongly recovering economy. 
Another notable Irish exception to the substantial knock to global equity markets last Thursday was DCC. It issued 
a trading statement that morning that was significantly more upbeat than the market had been expecting. Due to the 
higher than normal winter temperatures of recent months - which was expected to impact negatively on DCC's 
energy division's performance - the market had been marking down the company's share price since the start of the 
International markets remain nervous but Irish banks sparkle
year. But the trading statement confirmed previous guidance of expected earnings per share growth being 
substantially ahead of the previous year. Continued tight cost control improved margins and progress on integration 
of the company's recently-acquired energy distribution businesses enabled DCC to confirm their previous guidance 
of expected earnings for the year to the end of March to be significantly ahead of the previous year.  
The shares rose by more than 4 per cent on Thursday - one of the few exceptions to the overall market rout in 
London where DCC is listed. However, when the market recovered on Friday, an Irish share which didn't follow the 
recovery was Ryanair, as the market saw the sudden spike in the oil price as a potential headwind for the airline.  
As to the Irish market overall, investors are likely to keep a watchful eye on the outcome of the general election. 
While most of Ireland's largest companies are internationalised and unlikely to be affected by a result which 
suggests that political instability beckons, the impact on the Irish bond market and knock-ons for the banks of such 
an outcome would almost certainly be negative. 
Not all is gloom internationally. Europe's economy is recovering and with continued employment and earnings 
growth in the US, in the absence of deepening problems in China and increased instability in the Middle East, 
growth prospects in the developed world look reasonable. However, investor expectations for returns from equity 
markets for the rest of the year will be tempered by some material macroeconomic and geopolitical risks that 
remain (including Brexit), as well as the unknown unknowns about China.

It's been a big week for sporting protests. After Liverpool fans walked out of a match at Anfield in protest at 
proposed ticket-price increases, supporters of German club Borussia Dortmund staged a similar protest. Subverting 
the German expression "great tennis" - meaning something very good - they launched a barrage of tennis balls on 
to the field during a cup game. Here are four other outbreaks of spectator rebellion.
1. On June 4, 1913, Emily Davison, suffragette and former school teacher, threw herself under King George V's 
horse at the Epsom Derby. Davison, who was already known to the police for various acts of public rebellion, died 
of her injuries a few days later and became an emblem of the suffragette movement. Opinion is still divided over 
whether she actually intended to die or was simply trying to attract attention to women's rights by disrupting the 
race.
2. In one of the more unusual on-pitch protests, John Foley handcuffed himself to the goalposts during Everton's 
Premier League match against Manchester City at Goodison Park in January 2012. Believing Ryanair's chief 
executive Michael O'Leary to be in attendance at the game, Foley directed his protest at the "exploitation" of young 
cabin crew trainees by the budget airline. After being cut free by the police, Foley was banned from attending 
games for three years.
3. The 158th University Boat Race was interrupted when Australian activist Trenton Oldfield entered the river 
Thames and swam into the path of the rowers near Hammersmith Bridge. It was the first time in its history the race 
had been disrupted by a bather. The race was restarted half an hour later and ended in a Cambridge victory after 
Four sporting protests The List
Oxford broke an oar. Oldfield, who said he'd embarked on his act of "civil disobedience" as a protest against the 
elitism represented by the race, was sentenced to six months in prison.
4. "Paper bag protests" have been widespread in the United States, particularly among fans of American football. 
The trend - in which supporters wear brown bags over their heads to express embarrassment at their team's 
wavering fortunes - is thought to have started in 1980, when fans of the New Orleans Saints wore bags after the 
team ended the season with just one win and 15 losses, the worst ever result for a team at that time. Fans renamed 
the team the "Aints" for the occasion.

Twitter 's decline brings hope of end to corporate gaffes

Some denizens of cyber space are starting to sour on Twitter. The social media site reported this week that the 
number of total active monthly users stalled at 320m in the fourth quarter. When people who only use SMS - and 
don't see adverts - are excluded, usage actually fell for the first time, by 2m to 305m.
However, chief financial officer Anthony Noto said that growth in new users had continued throughout the period, 
and numbers of daily users remained broadly stable. Doing the maths, that means that occasional users - the non-
addicts - must be starting to bail out in droves.
While troubling for Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, the declining enthusiasm for 140-character messages may 
not be such a bad thing for the rest of us. Gaffes can and do happen anywhere, from internal staff memos to dumb 
Instagram photos, and when they happen online trolls can be counted on to leap on them. But there is something 
about Twitter that seems to bring out the worst in everyone. From the PR executive who tweeted she would not get 
Aids in Africa because "I'm white" to the person who was so "sick of the US government. I'm moving to California", 
Twitter users often type first and think later.
This week, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen became the latest person to get himself into hot water. A Facebook 
board member, he lashed out at Indian regulators for blocking the company's scheme to provide free but limited 
mobile access, calling the move " economically suicidal . . . anti-colonialism". The ensuing Twitter storm turned so 
brutal that Mr Andreessen eventually deleted the comments and apologised. Even so, Facebook founder Mark 
Zuckerberg felt the need to distance himself publicly from his longtime backer. Using a Facebook post, rather than a 
Twitter 's decline brings hope of end to corporate gaffes
tweet, Mr Zuckerberg said he "found the comments deeply upsetting, and they do not represent the way Facebook 
or I think at all".
Corporate Twitter users have repeatedly embarrassed themselves. Some do it while trying to connect with their 
customers. JPMorgan Chase's 2013 #AskJPM question and answer session was supposed to be offering career 
advice for would-be bankers. Instead, it sparked a cascade of bitter complaints about the US bank's various 
financial scandals. British Gas and budget airline Ryanair had similarly disastrous experiences with Twitter 
engagement sessions.
Consumer-facing groups can also get into trouble with inappropriate tweets linked to current events. UK 
supermarket Tesco was roundly ridiculed for tweeting that it was "time to hit the hay" during a scandal about selling 
horsemeat, and US pizza group DiGiorno used a hashtag about domestic violence (#WhyIStayed) to promote its 
products. Finally, there is the human factor. Disgruntled staff took over music retailer HMV's account to announce 
that they were all being fired in a "mass execution", and Twitter's own Mr Noto mistakenly tweeted out confidential 
deal plans.
Part of the problem is that Twitter's format encourages snap comments and rapid responses, so errors get made. 
And when that happens, the public nature of the site and its widespread use by journalists, means that critics can 
and do pounce.
Twitter says user growth rebounded in January, but some reluctant corporate users may well be hoping that this is 
the beginning of the end.

Highlight: Sir Stelios presses for dividends to be set at 50% of post-tax profits
Body
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou , founder of easyJet and its largest shareholder, is stepping up pressure again on the 
budget airline by calling for a further increase in dividends.
Ahead of easyJet's annual meeting tomorrow, Sir Stelios called for the company to increase its dividend payout 
from 40 per cent of post-tax profits to 50 per cent.
He also said easyJet should halt its practice of paying special dividends and instead return any surplus cash 
through share buybacks.
The ratcheting up of pressure comes after two years of relative tranquility between Sir Stelios and easyJet's board - 
until early 2014, he fought the company over dividends, executive pay and fleet expansion.
Sir Stelios said yesterday that easyGroup, his investment vehicle, would use a token 20m shares in easyJet - 
representing about 5 per cent of the company's total stock - to oppose the re-election of John Barton , chairman, so 
as to make the case for an increase in the dividend payout.
"In the last five years, the easyJet board's scattergun approach has meant a haphazard mixture of ordi-nary and 
special dividend payments that has left investors confused and uncertain as to the company's intentions when 
EasyJet founder calls for higher investor payouts Airlines
rewarding shareholders," said Sir Stelios, who established easyJet in 1995 and stepped down from the board in 
2010.
He then launched campaigns for the introduction of dividends and a halt to fleet expansion, arguing the company 
should focus on shareholder returns.
After consulting with its shareholders, easyJet issued a maiden dividend in 2011 that was widely seen as a victory 
for Sir Stelios.
But Sir Stelios lost campaigns against a large aircraft order placed by easyJet in 2013, and a big increase in the pay 
of Carolyn McCall , chief executive, in 2014.
EasyJet has increased dividends from 20 per cent of profits in 2011 to 40 per cent in 2015. Two special dividends 
have also been paid.
If shareholders approve dividends proposed at the annual meeting, they will have received a total of £988m since 
2011. Sir Stelios and his family have a 34 per cent stake in easyJet, and secured about £340m in dividends.
Sir Stelios said buybacks offered a "better way" than special dividends to maximise shareholder value, and noted 
Ryanair's practice of purchasing its stock so as to return cash to investors.
He also highlighted how Ryanair's shares had risen 87 per cent in the past two years, while easyJet's stock had 
fallen by 12 per cent.
This partly reflects how Ryanair's shares dropped after two profit warnings in the autumn of 2013 and then 
recovered after an improved customer service strategy was unveiled.
EasyJet's shares have fallen almost 10 per cent since its first-quarter trading update in January, when it said 
revenue had been squeezed by the terrorist attacks in Egypt and France.
Sir Stelios said he did not want to see Mr Barton removed because he was doing a good job, but warned that 
"directors will need vigilance against a background of a 23 per cent share price deterioration in the last 52 weeks".
EasyJet declined to comment.

British Airways said it would begin flying from Stansted Airport, establishing a presence at London's No.3 airport for 
the first time and bringing it into direct competition with budget carrier Ryanair on leisure routes.
BA, owned by International Airlines Group, said on Tuesday that from May it would fly to Faro in Portugal, as well 
as Ibiza, Malaga and Palma in Spain, from 49 pounds one way.
The full-service operator, which provides complimentary refreshments on flights, will compete directly on those 
routes with no-frills Ryanair, whose cheapest flights in May cost about 25 pounds one way.
BA's move into secondary airport Stansted enters traditional budget carrier territory, a change from a wider trend of 
low cost airlines increasingly flying from a city's main airport and stealing market share from full-service airlines. 
Stansted, 35 miles north of London, will become BA's fourth airport in the region. It already flies from London's 
Heathrow, Gatwick and City airports. BA said the flights would be operated by its BA CityFlyer subsidiary on two-
cabin 98-seat Embraer jets which are usually based at London City. (Reuters) Source: www.businessworld.ie

Ryanair modestly puts its current boon down to oil prices

Highlight: But is the born-again airline simply biding its time before going for low-cost, long-haul king Norwegian?
Body
There is only one word to describe the performance of Ryanair in the two years since since it decided to morph into 
a more understated, more customer-friendly version of its brash self: phenomenal. 
Where once the airline revelled in Michael O'Leary's colourful outbursts, it now relies on simple black-and-white 
numbers to tell the story: (EURO)103 million in profits after tax in its latest quarterly results; 200 airports in 31 
countries, with 78 main bases; 6million app downloads and 350 more 737 aircraft on order from Boeing. 
Most impressively of all, it is translating all of this into passenger growth at a relentless pace. Last year was the first 
year it passed the 100 million passenger mark. The airline says it will carry 106 million passengers in its current 
financial year to the end of March and it has targeted growth to 180 million passengers per annum by 2024. But 
calculations by this newspaper suggest that if Ryanair's monthly growth in 2015 was to be repeated in 2016, it 
would finish 2016 with total passenger numbers of close to 120 million. 
That, of course, presumes Ryanair can continue to place its new aircraft successfully into new bases or existing 
bases with capacity for growth. Ryanair's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs is, for Ryanair, uncharacteristically 
modest. 
"If you are an airline at the moment who can't make a profit with the price of fuel where it is, then you are doing a 
spectacularly bad job. We are not the geniuses that we might look like. No one expected oil to be at this level," he 
said. 
Jacobs is quick to warn that the fuel price bonanza will not continue for ever, and that a rise in oil prices will change 
the aviation industry dynamic. 
"Probably one or two airlines will go bust when the price of fuel goes up. And the price of fuel will go up. You will 
then see who is swimming with their trunks on or off," he said. 
Ryanair modestly puts its current boon down to oil prices
Such a scenario would, no doubt, present opportunities to cash-rich Ryanair and force it to answer a fundamental 
question: is it happy to continue on its steady path of growth for the next decade or would it risk the complexities of 
a big game-changing acquisition? 
Speculation surfaced in the US last month that Ryanair could buy rival Easyjet. Irish and European analysts spoken 
to by this newspaper poured cold water on the notion. Competition issues alone would rule out such a deal. Neither 
would it give Michael O'Leary anything he does not already have, apart from headaches. 
But much more interesting, agreed a number of industry analysts, would be the prospect of Ryanair, at some point, 
moving to buy low-cost competitor Norwegian. It has had success developing a low-cost model to the US, 
something Ryanair has long contemplated. But if the Scandinavian airline's rapid growth runs out of steam, Ryanair 
could swoop, said analysts. 
A crowded European market
"Any such deal will not be immediate, but could happen in the next three years," said German-based aviation expert 
Heinrich Grossbongardt. "Ryanair is currently very busy changing its business model and relocating its fleet to hub 
airports. That requires financial means and management attention. But once that is complete, acquiring someone 
could be the next step." 
"Norwegian has something that Ryanair lacks that in the long run will be critical: a long-haul product with big growth 
potential. The European market will become more and more crowded with Ryanair, Easyjet, Norwegian, not to 
mention the aggressively growing Wizz Air in eastern and central European markets. It is inevitable that a carrier 
the size of Ryanair will need to get a foot in the long-haul market, and Norwegian has already achieved this." 
If Norwegian hits financial turbulence and is struggling to finance its aggressive growth and fleet plans by itself, that 
could be the moment that Ryanair strikes, said Grossbongardt, who is managing director of Hamburg-based 
Expairtise. 
"It would be a good move by Ryanair and could work well," he said. 
One well-informed Irish aviation analyst said an airline "would want to be on their knees bleeding before Ryanair 
would swoop", but added that Norwegian is without doubt the most interesting asset in the European airline industry 
for Ryanair, given Norwegian's low-cost, long-haul business, as well as Ryanair's relatively scant coverage of 
Scandinavia. 
"The simple thing for O'Leary is to grow the business out to 150 million passengers over the next five years and 
make a lot of money doing that," he said. 
"But my view is that Ryanair should stay close to Norwegian in case it does get into difficulties. In that scenario, 
Ryanair would be perfect to come in and run it as a separate brand." 
Although Norwegian continues to grow strongly, it faces a range of challenges such as financing an enormous 
aircraft order book relative to its size and has had to aggressively drop fares to fill aircraft during a period of rapid 
growth, he said. It also faces regulatory issues in the US that threatens some new routes, including its proposed 
Cork to Boston service. 
"Its last corporate bond issue was done at 10 per cent or above, very expensive given that Ryanair borrows money 
at less than 2 per cent," said the analyst. 
But he said that a key hurdle to any such deal, should the opportunity arise, would come from within Ryanair. 
"The board of Ryanair is very suspicious and sceptical of low-cost long-haul. O'Leary has said he would only do it if 
the planes came at a really cheap price. So such a deal would not be without its challenges even before the EU 
Commission ever took a look at it." 
Ryanair modestly puts its current boon down to oil prices
Indeed, according to Kenny Jacobs, there is no temptation within Ryanair to "dip a toe" into an Atlantic route using 
its narrow-body Boeing 737 fleet aircraft the way others have. Right now, he said, things are working so well for the 
airline that management does not want to get distracted. 
"That would be a distraction and we have too much to go after in Europe. We'll stick to our knitting here, adding new 
bases and working with what we have. We don't need an acquisition to get to the 180 million passenger mark. It 
would push us beyond that. But if the right opportunity came along at the right time, we would look at it. But we 
don't need to to deliver the plan," said Jacobs. 
Sense and sensibility
But Jacobs did confirm that negotiations are progressing with Norwegian about a deal that would see Ryanair feed 
short-haul passengers into the Scandinavian airline's long-haul network. Such an operation could be underway 
before the end of this year and would provide Ryanair a blueprint to sell to other more reticent potential partners, for 
example, IAG's Aer Lingus, said Jacobs. 
"If we are feeding Norwegian on long-haul, then it would be interesting to give that a year and see how the industry 
evolves," he said. 
"We think this is a natural thing that is going to happen in the European industry as low-cost comes to dominate. It 
solves two problems for the high-cost airlines, which history has shown are better concentrating on long-haul. It 
gives them extra demand and also means they are less reliant on going head-to-head with low-cost carriers on 
short-haul routes to feed their hubs," said Jacobs. 
But, in reality, Ryanair is in the comfortable position that it can focus on the day job of filling its ever increasing fleet 
of 737s as they are delivered by Boeing and dispatched to bases throughout Europe. 
Germany is likely to be a key focus of this growth, according to Jacobs. The airline had a relatively modest, by its 
own standards, 5 per cent market share in Europe's biggest market last year, flying eight million customers. By 
2024, that figure could rise to 30 million passengers, with key cities such as Cologne and Hamburg presenting 
particular growth opportunities. 
"If Germany provides a big chunk of our growth, then you also have to look at some of the markets around 
Germany, such as the Netherlands and Austria, where we are relatively small," said Jacobs. 
"Take Scandinavia. We are still very happy to let Norwegian and SAS scrap it out in a price war there so we won't 
add huge amounts of capacity there for now, outside of primary airports. But between now and 2024, Scandinavia 
could account for 15 million extra passengers per annum for us." 
In central and eastern Europe, the airline is also taking the fight to Wizz Air, the latest low-cost pretender to its 
throne. Economic growth in Romania and Bulgaria, as well as an increasing appetite in the Polish market for sun 
travel, is helping to fuel the airline's expansion. Any future move by the Turkish authorities to open its skies to 
European carriers would likely be met by an enthusiastic Ryanair response, particularly from Germany, said 
Jacobs. 
Dublin too, where Ryanair added 1.2 million extra passengers last year, could be a continued focus of growth for 
the airline, he said, and the airline could add a similar number of passengers here again next year "as long as there 
are sensible airport charges and a sensible airport plan". 
Undoubtedly, any deviation from sense will see Ryanair's polite new mask slip very quickly indeed.

Highlight: Vodafone believes it is perfectly positioned to make the connection work best for customers
Body
Last year's Vodafone Cloud Barometer report confirmed what many suspected: that the cloud is now an established 
part of IT delivery and its adoption is on the rise. The survey of 700 senior IT decision makers across 16 countries 
revealed that 89 per cent of enterprises anticipate using some kind of cloud by the end of 2016, up from 77 per cent 
in 2014. 
More surprising perhaps was the revelation that 70 per cent of enterprises use or would consider using the cloud for 
mission-critical enterprise applications, such as business intelligence and ERP (enterprise resource planning) 
systems. 
All of this chimes nicely with Vodafone, which has been reinventing itself, first as a one-stop network and 
communications company, and more recently as cloud services provider. "Seven years ago we were a mobile-only 
company and offering data centre services would have seemed a stretch," said Liam O'Brien, head of business 
products at Vodafone Ireland. "Delivering complex services to customers like Ryanair and Paddy Power has given 
us a lot of credibility." 
With access to 14 data centres across nine countries - including three in Ireland - the company is working hard to 
expand its cloud portfolio, competing directly against the likes of BT with managed private clouds and a similar 
capability when it comes to connecting publics clouds and hybrid services. 
Co-location, managed hosting with bespoke hardware, private cloud services and infrastructure-as-a-service are all 
part of a product portfolio that comes with the option of a managed service wrap. It's all striking a chord with 
multinationals that are using Ireland as a launch pad into Europe and the rest of the world. 
Like other telcos, Vodafone has seen the market move its way with the network becoming a primary component in a 
new wave of IT service delivery. "The network makes the cloud," said O'Brien. "Whatever application you are 
Where mobile meets cloud
running in the cloud, whether it's public or private, you will need a good quality data network to get those 
applications on to a device and into the hands of employees." 
What makes Vodafone different from most of its competitors is its roots in cellular services. With 80 per cent of 
participants in the Barometer survey saying that mobilising the workforce is a key input into their data centre 
strategy, it's a useful pedigree to have. 
"Consuming apps on mobile devices is a driver for cloud services. A cloud model allows you to deliver applications 
to a device that is no longer connected to the corporate network easily and efficiently," he said. "It's all about having 
a high-spec, good-quality device in your hand with a secure connection across 3G or 4G, a VPN, then on to a core 
network and into the data centre. We can offer all of that." 
O'Brien claims that there isn't another company on the planet that can provide the same scale of mobility as 
Vodafone and tie it in to cloud services.  
And it's about connecting to just about any cloud - not just Vodafone's. He reels off a list that includes IBM 
SoftLayer, HP Helium, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. "We are currently working with partners to 
create a single pane of glass to provide services across public and private clouds," said O'Brien.

Online travel agent On the Beach this week said the threat of terror attacks was causing a shift in its customers' 
holiday preferences, as consumers avoid the eastern Mediterranean and head to countries such as Spain and 
Portugal.
The company said events such as the bombing of a Russian jet over Egypt and attacks on European tourists in 
Sharm el-Sheikh had caused "significant volatility in traffic" over the four months to January 31, echoing recent 
reports from Ryanair and EasyJet about weaker demand for air travel.
However, a spokesperson for On the Beach said its lack of fixed assets meant the company could respond well to 
changing demand. Chief executive Simon Cooper said the company had "delivered a solid period of growth".
The company failed to convince some investors, with shares falling 6 per cent yesterday. But a closing price of 
287p still represented a 56 per cent rise since its IPO in September.

Ryanair have today reported that traffic grew 25% to 7.5m customers in January. Their load factor rose 5% points to 
88% and rolling annual traffic to January grew 17% to 102.9m customers.
Ryanair raised its full-year profit forecast by 25 percent in early September, citing poor summer weather in northern 
Europe, strong sterling and the impact of improved customer service.
But security alerts after attacks in Paris in November and strong competition has since forced it to cut average 
fares, which fell 1 percent in the last three months of 2015 and will fall 6 percent in the first three months of 2016.
"We expect the lower fare environment to continue for the foreseeable future" with some respite during the summer 
months, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a video presentation. Rival easyJet said last week its revenue per 
seat fell 3.7 percent in the three months to Dec. 31 and that it would continue to fall in early 2016. Ryanair last year 
was the first airline in the world to carry 100 million international passengers. On Monday, it increased its forecast 
for its financial year to March 31 to 106 million from 105 million and said it expected to grow to 113 million in its next 
financial year. Chief Financial Officer at Ryanair, Kenny Jacobs today commented, "Ryanair's January traffic grew

It was announced today that 85 full-time and 30 part-time jobs are being created by six businesses operating at 
Belfast International Airport.
This is the third consecutive announcement of a major jobs boost at the airport and will mean the injection in wages 
of more than £1.5 million into the Northern Ireland economy.
This latest batch will bring to 298 the total number of new jobs announced at the airport within the past two months. 
The jobs are across a wide cross-section of aviation support activities including on-site food outlets, taxi operations 
and private charter services.
Caterers SSP is planning to increase its workforce by 20 full-time and 30 part-time staff while the Fed & Watered 
outlet will add 10 new employees to the payroll. The airport taxi firm, Belfast Airport Taxis, is taking on thirty 
additional drivers to deal with the expected increase in passenger numbers with planned expansion by existing 
airlines and the opening of a three-aircraft hub by Ryanair at the end of March. Catering, retail and logistics 
company, LSG, has 16 places to fill. Private charter company, Jet Assist, will create 6 jobs with Car Care Solutions 
adding 3additional jobs. All of the jobs will be featured at an Airport Jobs Fair to be held in the Templeton Hotel, 
Templepatrick, next Monday afternoon, 8th February. Belfast International Airport Director of Commercial 
Development, Brian Carlin said, "These jobs have little or no lead-in times. There's a need for them now as we

Body
Ryanair plans to return EUR800m to investors through its largest share buyback to date, highlighting how Europe's 
leading budget airline has made significant progress to overhaul its aggressive image and poor customer service.
The Dublin-based low-cost carrier yesterday reported third-quarter net profit of EUR102.7m, up 110 per cent 
compared with the same period in 2014.
The EUR800m buyback is the strongest evidence yet of Ryanair's recovery after two profit warnings in the autumn 
of 2013, when Michael O'Leary , its outspoken chief executive, admitted the company annoyed too many 
passengers and promised a strategy overhaul.
Changes to Ryanair's business model included cutting baggage fees and other charges that put some people off 
travelling with the airline. It also sought to copy easyJet's strategy of wooing business people, partly by announcing 
plans to fly to more major European hubs rather than obscure airports far from city centres.
The company credits this new approach for the improvement in its fortunes, which saw it become the first airline to 
carry 100m international passengers during a single year in 2015. Last September, Ryanair raised its full-year profit 
guidance for the year to March 2016 by 25 per cent, to a range of between EUR1.17bn and EUR1.22bn.

recovery yet
"They have radically transformed their business and the exciting thing is it seems like they've still got a long way to 
go," says Oliver Sleath, an analyst at Barclays.
But not all of Ryanair's recent progress is down to its new strategy. European airlines in general are benefiting from 
Europe's modest economic recovery and lower fuel prices. Even Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, flag carriers hit by 
strikes, are predicting record profits for 2015.
There have also been setbacks. Ryanair's third-quarter earnings missed analysts' expectations because it felt 
compelled to cut fares after November's terrorist attacks in Paris, which caused some people to shun air travel.
The airline said average fares fell 1 per cent to EUR40 in its third quarter, and warned they could decline by 6 per 
cent in the three months to March 31.
Ryanair is not the only transport group to be affected by the Paris attacks. Last week, easyJet warned its revenue 
per seat in the three months to December 31 was due to fall, while Stagecoach, the bus and train operator, said last 
year its earnings could be affected.
Ryanair also warned that its fourth quarter and next financial year could see average fares hurt by unfavourable 
currency movements and a EUR2.50 increase in Italy's municipal tax that is levied on passengers.
However, analysts say Ryanair has allayed fears that changes to its business model, notably its move into more 
major European airports, would result in significantly higher costs. Ryanair said it expected unit costs excluding fuel 
to fall by 2 per cent in 2015-16.
"The shift in strategy seems to have worked well in the context of cash," says Stephen Furlong, an analyst at Davy, 
Ryanair's broker.
"It's a cash machine. And the cost base continues to be industry leading and falling."
Plans for the EUR800m buyback come after Ryanair said in September it would hand EUR400m to shareholders 
after the sale of its 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus to International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways. This 
is being supplemented in 2015-16 by a EUR400m buyback.
While investors have benefited from ad hoc capital returns, Neil Sorahan , Ryanair's finance director, said the airline 
had no plans to commit to a regular dividend or share buyback.
He partly justified this stance by referring to a volcanic eruption in Iceland in 2010 that caused travel chaos by 
causing some of the biggest European airspace closures since the second world war.
"It's a very cyclical industry, you can wake up to find a volcano erupting in your back yard, so we don't want to 
commit to a regular dividend," he said. "We prefer to do ad hoc chunky buybacks . . . which we think is a better 
position for our shareholders."
Ryanair needs its new customer service strategy to work - in the spring of 2013 it agreed to buy 175 short-haul 
passenger jets from Boeing in a $16bn deal.
Such is Ryanair's confidence that it confirmed yesterday that it expected to hit the upper end of its net profit target 
for 2015-16. It also predicted it will carry 106m passengers.
This momentum looks unlikely to disappear. Ryanair is aiming to carry 180m passengers a year by 2024, by which 
time Mr O'Leary is targeting net profit of EUR2bn.

Dividends do not mix very well with airlines' business models. Of the large listed European airline groups, only 
easyJet has paid a regular and progressive dividend over the past few years. It is not hard to see why. Aviation is a 
capital-intensive industry, reliant on substantial debt financing of aircraft purchases. It is also cyclical and prone to 
external shocks from terrorist attacks , volcanic eruptions and oil price volatility.
There is a way around these uncomfortable realities. Ryanair has never paid a regular dividend. Since 2008 it has 
returned a total of EUR2.9bn to investors via a combination of special dividends and share buybacks that fit around 
its capital allocation priorities. It said yesterday that it would kick off another EUR800m programme of share 
repurchases; the shares rose 5 per cent even though Ryanair missed analysts' forecasts for net income.
A blueprint for other cyclical, capital-intensive industries? Up to a point. One criticism of share buybacks - that they 
leave investors with a bigger slice of a smaller pie - is blunted by Ryanair's rapid growth. Its share count has fallen 8 
per cent since 2008 as equity has risen 62 per cent. The relatively smooth ascent of its share price has meant it 
rarely suffered the indignity of buying back shares only to see the stock fall back.
Ryanair thinks it will keep growing; full-year profit will be at the top of its forecast range and it plans to carry 80 per 
cent more passengers by 2024. The shares do not look particularly overvalued (though they do trade at a higher 
multiple of profits than easyJet's). Yet much of the benefit of expected lower fuel prices will be passed through to 
customers in the form of lower fares, just when the industry is embarking on a period of above-average capacity 
growth. European capacity will grow more than 7 per cent in 2016, says Citigroup, putting more pressure on ticket

As a low-cost carrier, Ryanair will weather those conditions better than most of its rivals. Still, for buybacks to carry 
on working, Ryanair needs a lot to go right. For future returns, the company should instead consider paying a 
special dividend, as it did after selling its Aer Lingus stake . That may have tax implications for investors but it does 
afford those who are less ebullient about industry prospects a choice in how the cash is deployed.

RYANAIR is planning to return (EURO)800m (£609m) to its shareholders, after it unveiled a huge share buyback.
The company said by the end of the nine-month process, it will have returned (EURO)4bn to shareholders over 
eight years.
The announcement came as the Irish budget airline posted results showing profits after tax jumped to (EURO)103m 
in the three months to the of December, a 110 per cent increase on the year before. Traffic rose 20 per cent to 25m 
passengers, with revenues rising 17 per cent to (EURO)1.3bn.
Average fares fell one per cent to (EURO)40, which the company put down to its snappily-titled "load factor 
active/yield passive" pricing strategy.
However, Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive, said bookings had fallen after the terrorist attacks in Paris 
and Brussels.
"We reacted to this softness by running price promotions and discounted fares to stimulate double digit traffic 
growth."
The airline added that it expects net profits will be towards the upper end of the (EURO)1.17bn to (EURO)1.22bn 
range.
"We caution, however, that this guidance is heavily dependent on the absence of further unforeseen events 
impacting close-in bookings and yields in the fourth quarter, especially over Easter," he added.
Shares took off yesterday, rising 5.45 per cent by the close.

Ryanair forecast record passenger numbers will enable it to hit its annual profit target, despite falling ticket prices 
due to security alerts in Europe and cheaper oil.
The low-cost giant said on Monday average fares will continue to fall in the coming months as more airlines take 
advantage of lower fuel prices.
It also announced an 800 million euro share buyback over the next nine months.
Ryanair hiked its full-year profit forecast by 25 percent in early September, citing poor summer weather in Northern 
Europe, weak sterling and the impact of improved customer service. But security alerts after attacks in Paris in 
November and strong competition has since forced it to cut average fares, which fell 1 percent in the last three 
months of 2015 and will fall 6 percent in the first three months of 2016. "We expect the lower fare environment to 
continue for the foreseeable future" with some respite during the summer months, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary 
said in a video presentation. Rival easyJet last week said its revenue per seat fell 3.7 percent in the three months to 
Dec. 31 and that it would continue to fall in early 2016. O'Leary said he expected to pass on a "significant amount" 
of 430 million euros of Ryanair's fuel cost savings, but that would be offset by a further 8 percent increase in 
passenger numbers in 2016. Ryanair last year was the first airline in the world to carry 100 million international 
passengers and on Monday increased its forecast for its financial year to March 31 to 106 million from 105 million. It 
plans to carry 26 percent more passengers in the first three months of 2016 compared to the same period last year. 
'LITTLE UPSIDE' ON PROFIT Ryanair re-affirmed its expectation to post net profit at the upper end of a range of 
1.175 billion to 1.225 billion euros for its financial year. O'Leary said that the current forecast was heavily dependent 
on a strong Easter and the presumption there will be no major militant attacks in Europe. Ryanair will start its 800 
million euro share buyback in the coming days, but said it had no plans to commit to a regular dividend or share buy 
back, and that these would be ad hoc. Shares in the airline closed Friday up 36 percent on the year at 13.69 euros, 
Ryanair expects to hit profit target despite obstacles Ryanair expects...
while the Thomson Reuters European Airline Index was flat. Ryanair shares have fallen 8.8 percent since the start 
of the year, compared to a fall of 10 percent in the index. (Reuters) Source: www.businessworld.ie

       VIENNA (dpa-AFX) - U.K. shares fell on profit taking on Monday, as oil prices fell around 2 percent following 
last week's sharp rally and disappointing data out of China and South Korea rekindled growth worries.   Asian 
markets surrendered early gains to end mixed, with Chinese stocks coming under significant selling pressure after 
the latest batch of manufacturing and service sector data heightened concerns of a deeper economic slowdown.   
U.S. stock futures also drifted lower amid fresh concerns over China's economy. 
After disappointing fourth-quarter GDP data, investors await U.S. personal income and spending, construction

Closer home, the benchmark FTSE 100 was down 29 points or 0.47 percent at 6,055 after climbing 2.6 percent on 
Friday, supported by higher oil prices and hopes for more stimulus measures in China, Europe and Japan.  
Commodity-related shares traded mostly lower, with Antofagasta, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell losing 1-2 percent.  
Rolls-Royce Holdings lost 1 percent despite winning a $2.7 billion order for Trent 1000 engines.  HSBC Holdings 
dropped 1.8 percent on a report it will impose a hiring and pay freeze globally in 2016 as part of its drive to cut as 
much as $5 billion in costs by the end of 2017.  BT Group rallied 3 percent after the telecom giant delivered a strong

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Irish no-frills airline Ryanair (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported Monday that it's third-quarter profit 
more-than-doubled from last year with strong traffic growth and lower unit costs, despite lower fares. Looking 
ahead, the company said it remains comfortable with full year guidance, and lifted its traffic forecast for the fourth 
quarter and fiscal 2016. Further, the Board has approved an 800 million euros share buy-back to commence on 
February 5.  Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said, 'We are pleased to report that our low fares policy delivered 
strong Q3 traffic and profit growth... Following a strong first half of Q3, we noted weaker pricing and bookings 
immediately after the terrorist events in Paris and Brussels. We reacted to this softness by running price promotions 
and discounted fares to stimulate double digit traffic growth.' 
 For the third quarter, pre-tax profit grew 105 percent to 111.1 million euros from 54.3 million euros a year ago. 
Profit for the quarter, all attributable to equity holders, climbed 110 percent to 103 million euros. Earnings per share 
grew 118 percent to 7.68 euro cents.  Revenue for the quarter climbed 17 percent to 1.33 billion euros from 1.132 
billion euros last year.  Scheduled revenues increased 18 percent year-over-year to 987.1 million euros driven by 
higher traffic, partly offset by lower average fares.  Ancillary revenues grew 16 percent to 342.4 million euros driven 
by a solid performance in on-board sales and reserved seating offset by reduced travel insurance and lower car-
hire.  Traffic grew 20 percent to 24.9 million customers from 20.8 million customers a year ago. Load factors rose 5 
percent points to 93 percent.  While average fares fell 1 percent to 40 euros, this was offset by 5 percent drop in 
unit costs, while unit costs excluding fuel was down 1 percent.  In the quarter, fuel and oil rose 7 percent to 485.1 
million euros due to an 11 percent increase in hours offset by lower euro fuel prices per gallon.  Looking ahead, for 
the fourth quarter, the company expects that traffic will grow by 26 percent, compared to previous estimate of 22 
percent.  With limited visibility of close-in Easter bookings in March, the company now expects fourth quarter fares 
to fall by 6 percent, compared to previous view for drop of 4 percent.  With stronger load factors, the company 
raised fiscal 2016 traffic target to 106 million customers from previously expected 105 million customers. This 
represents a 17 percent increase on last year's 90.6 million customers.  Further, the company said it remains 
comfortable with full year guidance that net profits will be towards the upper end of the 1.175 billion euros to 1.225 
billion euros range, pre-exceptions.  The company cautions, however, that this guidance is heavily dependent on

the absence of further unforeseen events impacting close-in bookings and yields in Q4, especially over Easter,

       VIENNA (dpa-AFX) - The European markets ended the first session of the new trading week in the red. 
Following the rally at the end of the prior trading week, stocks gave up early gains Monday due to falling crude oil 
prices and renewed concerns over China. Disappointing Chinese manufacturing data spooked investors and 
caused oil prices to turn lower.  Chinese manufacturers signaled deterioration in operating conditions at the start of 
2016 but the pace of contraction slowed slightly from December, the results of a private survey showed Monday. 
  However, official data released by the government showed that the manufacturing sector underwent a faster 
contraction than seen at the end of 2015.   The Caixin Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 48.4 in January from 
48.2 in December, Markit said. Nonetheless, activity has been contracting for the eleventh successive month.   At 
the same time, the official manufacturing PMI fell to 49.4 in January from 49.7 in December. According to the 
National Bureau of Statistics report, the sector contracted for the sixth straight month.  The official non-
manufacturing PMI dropped to 53.5 from 54.4 in December but stayed in positive territory.  The European Central 
Bank will review and possibly reconsider its monetary policy stance when it meets in March, Executive Board 
member Benoit Coeure said Monday.   'But for the recovery to become structural - and thus to increase growth 
potential and reduce structural unemployment - monetary policy does not suffice,' policymaker said at a conference 
in Budapest.  The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks decreased 0.79 percent, while the Stoxx 
Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, lost 0.43 percent.  The DAX of Germany dropped 
0.41 percent and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.56 percent. The FTSE of the U.K. declined 0.39 percent and the SMI 
of Switzerland finished lower by 0.11 percent.  In Frankfurt, Dialog Semiconductor rose 1.30 percent. The 
chipmaker is eyeing new acquisition targets to spur growth, its chief executive told German weekly Euro am 
Sonntag.  Lab equipment maker Sartorius climbed 6.86 percent after updating its medium-term forecast.  BMW 
dropped 1.64 percent and Daimler fell 0.65 percent. Volkswagen also finished lower by 0.94 percent.  In Paris, Total 
sank 2.25 percent, but Technip advanced 0.92 percent.  Vivendi decreased 5.34 percent and LafargeHolcim 
weakened by 2.73 percent.   In London, HSBC Holdings dropped 1.60 percent on a report it will impose a hiring and 
pay freeze globally in 2016 as part of its drive to cut as much as $5 billion in costs by the end of 2017.  Rolls-Royce 
Holdings finished unchanged despite winning a $2.7 billion order for Trent 1000 engines.  BT Group climbed 1.93 
percent after the telecoms giant delivered a strong performance in the final quarter of 2015 and announced a new

organizational structure.   Ryanair Holdings jumped 5.45 percent after strong third-quarter earnings.  Nokia sank 
11.29 percent in Helsinki, after the firm said it had settled a lengthy patent dispute with South Korea's Samsung.  
The euro area manufacturing sector growth slowed as estimated in January with rates of expansion in output, new 
orders and new export business all easing at the start of the year, final survey data from Markit showed Monday.   
The final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 52.3 in January from 53.2 in December. The reading 
matched flash estimate.  British manufacturing growth quickened unexpectedly at the start of the year to the 
strongest level in three months, survey data from Markit Economics showed Monday. The Markit/Chartered Institute 
of Procurement & Supply Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing rose to 52.9 in January from 52.1 in 
December. Economists had expected the index to fall to 51.8.  U.K. mortgage approvals rose to a 4-month high in 
December, the Bank of England reported Monday. The number of mortgage approvals rose unexpectedly to 70,837 
in December from 70,424 in November. This was the highest since August 2015. Economists had forecast 
approvals to fall to 69,600 in December.  U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the fourth straight month in 
January, according to a report released by the Institute for Supply Management, although the index of activity in the 
sector did show a slight increase.  The ISM said its purchasing managers index inched up to 48.2 in January from a 
downwardly revised 48.0 in December, but a reading below 50 continues to indicate a contraction in manufacturing 
activity. Economists had expected the index to climb to a reading of 48.3 from the 48.2 originally reported for the 
previous month.  Personal income in the U.S. rose in line with economist estimates in the month of December, 
according to a report released by the Commerce Department on Monday, although the report also said personal 
spending came in virtually unchanged.  The report said personal income climbed by 0.3 percent in December, 
matching the increase seen in November as well as economist estimates.  Meanwhile, the Commerce Department 
said personal spending edged down by less than 0.1 percent in December after rising by 0.5 percent in the previous 
month. Spending had been expected to inch up by 0.1 percent.  With a jump in spending on public construction 
partly offset by a drop in spending on private construction, the Commerce Department released a report on Monday 
showing that U.S. construction spending rose much less than expected in December.  The Commerce Department 
said construction spending inched up 0.1 percent to an annual rate of $1.117 trillion in December from the revised 
November estimate of $1.116 trillion. Economists had expected spending to climb by 0.6 percent.

Fitch Ratings upgraded Southwest Airline's outlook from stable to positive in October. The news was an 
endorsement of the carrier's recent successes.
As well as earning an upgrade from Fitch, the airline generated its highest third-quarter profit and tapped the capital 
markets with a $500 million unsecured bond carrying the low coupon of 2.650%.
Southwest's strong cash position and stable leverage has set it up well for 2016. The airline has taken advantage of 
low interest rates and strong financial results to decrease gradually its leverage and refinance existing debt.
Tammy Romo, chief financial officer at the carrier, was understandably upbeat about the airline's achievements 
when she spoke with Airfinance Journal to discuss Southwest's strategy. "This quarter was a record performance 
on almost every front. So we couldn't be more delighted," she says.
Tapping the unsecured market
In November, Southwest closed a $500 million offering of five-year senior unsecured notes. The deal was 
especially notable for achieving a 2.650% coupon, which is competitive in the unsecured bond markets.
Unsecured debt is an option only available to a select few airlines because most could only issue paper at 
prohibitively high margins. Instead, many opt for commercial loans and aircraft securitizations to achieve tighter 
pricing.
The list of airlines that can choose unsecured debt consists largely of investment-grade carriers. According to 
Airfinance Journal's Deals Database, the 2015 group includes just a handful of legacy carriers such as Etihad, 
American Airlines and Latam.
One of Southwest's European counterparts, Ryanair, also opted for unsecured debt, in March 2015. The Irish airline 
priced its â,¬850 million ($882.3 million) eight-year Eurobond at the lowest coupon for an aviation issuance: 
1.125%.

Southwest's November issuance should be thought of as a refinancing, says Romo. The airline has substantial debt 
maturities "" totalling about $600 million "" due in 2016, including about $300 million in a single bullet payment. 
November's issuance will refinance those debt payments at tighter spreads.
The carrier was helped in this regard by its October upgrade from Fitch ratings. In its analysis of Southwest's credit 
rating, Fitch drew attention to its strong financials. It expects the airline to continue performing strongly.
In a statement, it wrote: "Going forward, Fitch expects Southwest to continue to generate solid free cash flow, 
exhibit stable or modestly declining leverage, and maintain its substantial financial flexibility. Southwest's 
investment-grade credit ratings are also supported by its competitive position in the US domestic market, its strong 
brand, and its sizeable base of high-quality unencumbered assets."
Speaking about the bond, Romo notes: "The market was favourable and the coupon rate was 2.65%, and we were 
delighted with that. That was actually below the debt that we issued last year, which was 2.75%."
She adds: "We were more than five times oversubscribed pretty much instantly. The morning went fast and furious, 
and there was obviously a healthy appetite for our notes." Tammy Romo, CFO of Southwest
Romo expects Southwest to continue tapping the bond markets for unsecured debt in the coming year. She points 
out that commercial debt and aircraft securitizations are a good option for many carriers, but if an airline can tap 
unsecured debt at low rates then it should do so.
Speaking about these other sources of financing, Romo says: "All of those are good opportunities in this low 
interest rate environment. For carriers who don't have the good fortune to have the strong credit rating that we do, I 
think EETCs [enhanced equipment trust certificates] continue to be a nice opportunity. But obviously for us, at the 
rates we're getting unsecured [debt], it just doesn't make sense in our situation."
She adds: "To the extent we decide to do additional refinancing next year, I would suspect that unsecured would be 
high on our list, obviously if the interest rate environment continues to be favourable."
Since Romo spoke with Airfinance Journal, the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates for the first time since 2006. In 
December last year, the Fed finally announced plans to hike interest rates, pushing them up by 25 bps to 0.5%.
Although the increase is relatively small, it will have an impact on the industry. For carriers like Southwest, the 
immediate effect will be a higher cost of borrowing. However, historically speaking there is no definitive link between 
interest rates and profitability.
Airlines have succeeded and failed in higher interest rate environments. What matters more is the traffic growth 
driven by higher levels of disposable income.
According to its third-quarter 2015 results, Southwest has an additional $310 million of 5.125% notes due 2017, so 
it may choose to do another refinancing in 2016.
There are other factors at play, but if the airline continues to post strong numbers and is still looked on favourably 
by the ratings agencies, then another unsecured issuance should not come as a surprise.
Snapping up 737-700s
Southwest has a large order book with Boeing for 737 Max aircraft. It became the launch customer for the Max 
variant when, in May 2013, it converted 30 existing orders for current models to the latest generation of Boeing's 
narrowbody family.
As of September, the airline's fleet consisted of almost 700 aircraft, including 119 -300s, 12 -500s, 463 -700s and 
98 -800s.

The carrier's unfilled orders with Boeing total 200 737 Max aircraft, 34 737-800s and 25 737-700s, according to the 
latest numbers from the manufacturer.
Although the airline is set to take a large number of new aircraft, it has also been very busy in the used market. 
Southwest has plans to take delivery of almost 60 737-700s in the next few years.
When discussing the carrier's activity in the secondary market for these aircraft, Romo says, with some 
understatement: "It's definitely true that we've been active in that market."
Airfinance Journal has heard some operators, active in the market for used -700s, speak about Southwest's buying 
spree with something bordering on irritation. The carrier has bought so many, one executive confided, that the 
aircraft are now quite difficult to come by.
Romo outlines the scale Southwest's aircraft purchases. "We have been very active in that market for a bit now, 
and we are at a point where there's not as many -700s that there were a year or two ago," she says. "For instance, 
in 2015 what we last reported was 24 additional -700 aircraft and 15 for 2016, and we've got 14 coming in 2017 and 
four in 2018. Including all of 2015, that's 57 pre-owned -700s."
As Romo explains, these deliveries are replacing the 717s Southwest acquired during its merger with Air Tran in 
2011. Southwest has been sub-leasing its 717s to Delta, helping it to keep the uniform fleet that is central to its low-
cost business model.
She adds: "The pre-owned market came together very nicely. As we were replacing the 717s, the pre-owned 
market was quite favourable, and we jumped in and took advantage of that.
"We have been very focused on our fleet planning here for the last several years, and the benefits from our fleet-
modernization efforts. We're right on track with what we were expecting, which is a $700 million Ebit [earnings 
before interest and tax] contribution just from a result of our fleet-modernization efforts."
In the absence of external shocks, 2016 looks promising for Southwest.
The airline continues to post record profits during a fleet modernization programme.
On the back of a very successful year, the carrier has also continued to issue enviably cheap debt - and it looks set 
to continue doing so, even in a higher interest rate environment.

(RTTNews) - European shares gave up early gains on Monday, as oil prices fell around 2 percent following last 
week's sharp rally and disappointing data out of China and South Korea rekindled growth worries.
Asian markets surrendered early gains to end mixed, with Chinese stocks coming under significant selling pressure 
after the latest batch of manufacturing and service sector data heightened concerns of a deeper economic 
slowdown.
U.S. stock futures also drifted lower amid fresh concerns over China's economy. After disappointing fourth-quarter 
GDP data, investors await U.S. personal income and spending, construction spending and manufacturing PMI 
numbers later in the day for further clues on the future path of rate increases.
Closer home, the pan-European STOXX 600 was down about 0.1 percent after climbing 2.2 percent on Friday, 
supported by higher oil prices and hopes for more stimulus measures in China, Europe and Japan.
Elsewhere, the German DAX, France's CAC 40 and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 were down between 0.4 percent and 0.6 
percent.
Commodity-related shares traded mostly lower in London, with Antofagasta, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell losing 1-
2 percent.
Rolls-Royce Holdings slid half a percent despite winning a $2.7 billion order for Trent 1000 engines.
HSBC Holdings dropped 2 percent on a report it will impose a hiring and pay freeze globally in 2016 as part of its 
drive to cut as much as $5 billion in costs by the end of 2017.
BT Group rallied 3 percent after the telecoms giant delivered a strong performance in the final quarter of 2015 and 
announced a new organizational structure.
Ryanair Holdings jumped 4 percent after strong third-quarter earnings.
Dialog Semiconductor rose over 2 percent in Frankfurt. The chipmaker is eyeing new acquisition targets to spur 
growth, its chief executive told German weekly Euro am Sonntag.
Lab equipment maker Sartorius climbed 5 percent after updating its medium-term forecast.
European Shares Give Up Early Gains
Nokia shares fell more than 10 percent after the Finnish firm said it had settled a lengthy patent dispute with South 
Korea's Samsung.
In economic releases, the euro area manufacturing sector growth slowed as estimated in January with rates of 
expansion in output, new orders and new export business all easing at the start of the year, final survey data from 
Markit showed.
While British manufacturing growth quickened unexpectedly at the start of the year to the strongest level in three 
months, U.K. mortgage approvals rose unexpectedly to 70,837 in December from 70,424 in November.

(RTTNews) - Irish no-frills airline Ryanair (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported Monday that it's third-quarter profit more-than-
doubled from last year with strong traffic growth and lower unit costs, despite lower fares. Looking ahead, the 
company said it remains comfortable with full year guidance, and lifted its traffic forecast for the fourth quarter and 
fiscal 2016. Further, the Board has approved an 800 million euros share buy-back to commence on February 5.
Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said, "We are pleased to report that our low fares policy delivered strong Q3 traffic 
and profit growth... Following a strong first half of Q3, we noted weaker pricing and bookings immediately after the 
terrorist events in Paris and Brussels. We reacted to this softness by running price promotions and discounted fares 
to stimulate double digit traffic growth."
For the third quarter, pre-tax profit grew 105 percent to 111.1 million euros from 54.3 million euros a year ago. Profit 
for the quarter, all attributable to equity holders, climbed 110 percent to 103 million euros. Earnings per share grew 
118 percent to 7.68 euro cents.
Revenue for the quarter climbed 17 percent to 1.33 billion euros from 1.132 billion euros last year.
Scheduled revenues increased 18 percent year-over-year to 987.1 million euros driven by higher traffic, partly offset 
by lower average fares.
Ancillary revenues grew 16 percent to 342.4 million euros driven by a solid performance in on-board sales and 
reserved seating offset by reduced travel insurance and lower car-hire.
Traffic grew 20 percent to 24.9 million customers from 20.8 million customers a year ago. Load factors rose 5 
percent points to 93 percent.
While average fares fell 1 percent to 40 euros, this was offset by 5 percent drop in unit costs, while unit costs 
excluding fuel was down 1 percent.
In the quarter, fuel and oil rose 7 percent to 485.1 million euros due to an 11 percent increase in hours offset by 
lower euro fuel prices per gallon.
Looking ahead, for the fourth quarter, the company expects that traffic will grow by 26 percent, compared to 
previous estimate of 22 percent.
Ryanair Q3 Profit Climbs, Lifts Traffic Forecast; To Buy Back EUR 800 Mln Shares
With limited visibility of close-in Easter bookings in March, the company now expects fourth quarter fares to fall by 6 
percent, compared to previous view for drop of 4 percent.
With stronger load factors, the company raised fiscal 2016 traffic target to 106 million customers from previously 
expected 105 million customers. This represents a 17 percent increase on last year's 90.6 million customers.
Further, the company said it remains comfortable with full year guidance that net profits will be towards the upper 
end of the 1.175 billion euros to 1.225 billion euros range, pre-exceptions.
The company cautions, however, that this guidance is heavily dependent on the absence of further unforeseen 
events impacting close-in bookings and yields in Q4, especially over Easter, where it is working to deliver 26 
percent traffic growth.
In London, Ryanair shares were trading at 14.01 euros, up 1.89 percent.
