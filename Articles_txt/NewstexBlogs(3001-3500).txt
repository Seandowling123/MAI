Ryanair | Published in: European News[1]Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline today (11 Dec) rejected recent 
speculation emanating from the Belgian Government and/or Brussels Airlines that there was some prospect that 
Ryanair would move to Brussels Zaventem when Brussels Airlines disappears due to its catastrophic losses. 
 Ryanair has rejected this idle speculation and confirmed its commitment to its base at Brussels Charleroi, where 
Ryanair has operated for 15 years, and has built a growing and successful partnership with Brussels South 
Charleroi Airport. 
Ryanair confirmed that it has recently reaffirmed its traffic development plans with Brussels Charleroi Airport, that it 
continues to add new aircraft and new routes at Charleroi, continues to grow traffic and jobs in Charleroi, and that it 
has no intention of moving to Brussels Zaventem, even if Brussels Airlines, an airline which is effectively controlled 
by Lufthansa, ceases operations. Ryanair called on the Belgian Government to reject Brussels Airlines pathetic 
attempt to obtain subsidies for its high labour costs, which would result in the Belgian taxpayer effectively 
subsidising Lufthansa, one of Europe's strongest airline groups. Ryanair pointed out that Lufthansa freely chose to 
take a 45% stake in Brussels Airlines, and if Lufthansa is unhappy with Brussels Airlines cost base, then it should 
reduce those costs or invest in the airline, rather than inappropriately pressurising the Belgian Government to 
subsidise another large Lufthansa partner. Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: 'Ryanair is extremely proud of its 15 
year partnership with Brussels Charleroi Airport. As our recent 10 year extension confirms, we remain committed to 
Brussels Charleroi regardless of what happens with Brussels Airlines and Zaventem. 'We are quite clear that if 
Brussels Airlines needs funding, then it should come from its principal shareholder Lufthansa, and not from artificial 
state aids or subsidies from the Belgian Government. In any event, Brussels Airlines problems are far deeper than 
its salary costs, or its airport costs at Zaventem. Our analysis suggests that Brussels Airlines is simply another high 
fare, high cost, airline in an era when most passengers want low fares and efficient services such as that provided 
successfully by Ryanair at Brussels Charleroi Airport.'

 New York, December 6th (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY[1]) closed 
the trading
day higher by $0.05 or 0.14% from its previous close. Ryanair's price action formed what is considered to be a
doji close, where the open and close prices are very close to each other, mainly signaling an indecision between 
buyers and sellers.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY[2]) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's trading range is defined by a trough, which marked calculated support at $32.49 and by a peak that set 
the 
resistance point at $35.68. These levels are closely watched by traders managing their positions.
Traders wanting to establish a position in Ryanair or traders that are already holding the stock can use the doji 
close to their advantage, since the pattern present a short-term pause in the stock's price action. This pause 
results in an entry point for traders depending of which way the stock resolves this short-term indecision.
The Doji is an important candlestick pattern that provides information on their own and as components in a number 
of important patterns. Doji form when a security's open and close are virtually equal. The length of the upper and 
lower shadows can vary and the resulting candlestick looks like a cross, inverted cross or plus sign. Alone, doji are 
neutral patterns.
Any bullish or bearish bias is based on preceding price action and future confirmation. In the case of Ryanair, given 
that the stock finished the session higher, bulls should monitor their positions for confirmation that the stock will 
continue higher by taking its intraday high. Below a Doji illustration:

Edinburgh Airport. This is a prime example of what can be achieved by dismantling the BAA monopoly and we look 
forward to further growth at Edinburgh Airport under its new ownership. Our summer 2013 schedule will see us 
operate 27 routes at Glasgow Prestwick, including 2 new routes to Rzeszow and Warsaw Modlin, which will help

investment at Edinburgh Airport. When I came to Edinburgh Airport in the summer, it was clear that we had to repair 
the relationship with Ryanair and work with them to provide more choice for Scottish passengers. I'm pleased that 
today we can announce a new relationship and new routes. This announcement underlines the fact that Edinburgh 
and Scotland is an attractive market for a variety of operators and that we as an airport are open and willing to do 
business to expand our network and encourage growth.' Iain Cochrane, Glasgow Prestwick CEO, said: 'We're 
delighted with Ryanair's latest commitment to grow its business from Glasgow Prestwick which is another sign of its 
continuing confidence in our airport. The decision to increase its Prestwick operations for next summer, along with 
new routes to Rzeszow and Warsaw is great news both for the airport and the region too. It gives travellers an even 
greater choice of value-for-money destinations next year and a further boost for the local economy, with more 
visitors to Scotland coming through the airport gateway.

upgraded by investment analysts at Goldman Sachs from a 'neutral' rating to a 'buy' rating in a note issued to 
investors on Tuesday. 
 The analysts wrote, 'We expect Ryanair to benefit from continued pricing strength in 2H13/FY14 (we forecast 
revenue per pax growth of 5.4%/3.2%) owing to capacity discipline in the European short-haul market. This, 
together with limited capex commitments, should drive improving asset turn and returns on capital as well as 
significant cash generation, placing Ryanair at an increasing discount to its historical valuation. We factor into our 
valuation a return on capital impact from a new plane order, which we expect to be limited.'

 Ryanair today (3 Dec) called on Minister Leo Varadkar to reverse the recently announced 2013 price increases at 
the DAA airport monopoly and the Government-controlled CIE train and bus monopolies to prevent visitors coming 
to Ireland for 'The Gathering' in 2013 being ripped-off by the Government-owned, high-priced transport providers.
Speaking at an aviation conference in Dublin today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: 'The much-hyped 'Gathering' in 
2013 is just another PR stunt, since it won't address or significantly increase seat capacity of airlines flying to 
Ireland in 2013. Instead, it allows the Dept of Transport's monopoly providers - the DAA, CIE/Iarnrod Eireann and 
Bus Eireann - to further hike prices by double digit percentages (up to 10 times inflation). Any new visitors coming 
to Ireland in 2013 will be ripped-off by the very Government that purports to welcome them. If the Dept of Transport 
is really committed to welcoming visitors to Ireland in 2013, then it should be: (1) cutting airport charges: (2) 
lowering bus and rail fares instead of hiking them yet again; and (3) taking up Ryanair's offer to significantly grow 
passenger numbers instead of protecting the failed, high-cost DAA monopoly. Since there is no significant increase 
in airline seat capacity to/from Ireland in 2013, any new visitors coming to Ireland for 'The Gathering' will simply 
displace other passengers who are already flying here. The much-trumpeted increase in transatlantic seats in 2013 
equates to a miserable 1% of actual passenger volume in 2012. The DAA monopoly is failing dismally to attract 
higher volume short-haul business by refusing to offer commercially competitive prices. This is why Ryanair is 
expanding rapidly in Europe while traffic at the three DAA airports continues to decline. If Minister Varadkar fails to 
reverse these recently announced price increases by the DAA and CIE, which he owns and controls, then The 
Gathering should be renamed 'The Grabbing', since every visitor to Ireland in 2013 will be ripped-off by the 
Government's air travel tax, higher DAA charges and unjustified increases in rail and bus fares by the tax payer-
subsidised CIE monopoly. This is the latest example of why Ireland's tourism industry is struggling. It is controlled 
and operated by a Department of Transport whose policy failures result in Irish consumers and visitors being 
gouged in order to finance its inefficient transport monopolies. The Irish economy urgently needs a radical agenda 
which delivers passengers and jobs instead of conferences, which substitute waffle for action.'

Caribbean to adopt new strategy to deal with APD

 BRIDGETOWN, Barbados: Barbados says the Caribbean will need to adopt a new strategy to ensure a 'fair' 
resolution to the controversial Air Passenger Duty (APD) tax that travellers out of the United Kingdom pay based on 
their destination.
 Tourism Minister Richard Sealy said that while the United Kingdom government has indicated it is not going to 
abolish the APD, the fight would now be to have the region re-banded within the existing system.
 'We are asking for the Caribbean to be re-banded. We are currently in Band 'C' and the US is in band 'B'. We are 
simply saying, because of how the APD is calculated, you pay a smaller (tax) when you are going to Honolulu, 
Hawaii or the west coast of the U.S. than when you are coming to Barbados, which is closer.
 'We believe there is a special case for the Caribbean, the most tourism dependent region in the world, to be re-
banded,' Sealy said. The APD, instituted in 1994, is a British environmental tax aimed at offsetting aviation's carbon 
footprint. In its initial stage, it was set at £5 (US$7.85) per person.
 Earlier this year, a number of leading international airlines, including British Airways, EasyJet, Ryanair and Virgin 
Atlantic urged Osborne to suspend the planned APD pending the outcome of an independent study of the economic 
effects of such a tax rise. The airlines said that the eight per cent increase introduced in April would reduce 
passenger numbers and hinder the UK's economic recovery.
 They said that as a result of the increase, a family of four flying from the UK to the Caribbean would have to pay 
close to £400 (US$625.08) in taxes. In 2005 such a family would have paid a total of £80 (US$125.06) in taxes.
 Regional governments have been lobbying London to remove the tax, which they said negatively affect the growth 
of the tourism industry since the Caribbean has been placed in a band that makes travel to the region much more 
expensive than travelling from London to the United States.
 Earlier this month, Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Chairman and St. Lucia's Prime Minister Dr. Kenny Anthony 
expressed disappointment that the United Kingdom has 'opted to retain its discriminatory approach' in dealing with 
the APD.
 Anthony had written to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne on the 'deleterious effect' the 
controversial United Kingdom Air Passenger Duty (APD) tax is continuing to have on Caribbean economies. Sealy 
said it is crucial to 'ramp up the lobby effort and in essence try to pressure the UK Government into recognising the 
absurd situation'.
 He said the Caribbean Diaspora in the UK could also serve as an advocate and lobby this effort, as public pressure 
often proved an effective catalyst for change. 'In fairness to them, they have not shut the door on us We have had 
Caribbean to adopt new strategy to deal with APD
minor successes in the past but we now need to see what we can do to have something more permanent in that 
respect,' he added.

Ryanair | Published in: European News[1]
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost airline, has confirmed deep cuts to its flights at Madrid and Barcelona and 
across its Spanish operations in 2013 in response to the Spanish Govt doubling of airport taxes at both Madrid and 
Barcelona El Prat airports on 1 July 2012.
 From 30th March 2013, Ryanair cut its Madrid and Barcelona operations as follows: Madrid (-35%): · 4 based 
aircraft cut (from 14 to 10); · 13 routes cancelled; · 22 route frequency cuts; · 272 weekly flights cut; · 1.9m pax lost 
(from 5.3m to 3.4m); · 1,900 'on site' jobs lost (ACI). Barcelona El Prat (-23%): · 1 based aircraft cut (from 13 to 12); 
· 4 routes cancelled; · 20 route frequency cuts; · 170 weekly flights cut; · 1.2m pax lost (from 5.4m to 4.2m); · 1,200 
'on site' jobs lost (ACI). Spain (total) (-12%): · 648 weekly flights cut; · 4.5m pax lost (from 30m to 25.5m); · 4,500 
'on site' jobs lost (ACI). These Ryanair cuts are the unavoidable response to the Spanish Govt's unjustified and 
unnecessary doubling of airport taxes at both Madrid and Barcelona El Prat airports in July 2012. These 
extortionate tax increases, which are now being investigated by the EU Commission, are particularly damaging for 
Spanish tourism, jobs and the economy at a time when youth unemployment in Spain stands at an alarming 50%. 
In Madrid, Ryanair's Michael Cawley said: 'Ryanair objects to the Spanish Govt's decision to double airport taxes at 
both Madrid and Barcelona airports and increase airport charges at many other Spanish airports. Sadly, this will 
again lead to severe traffic, tourism and job cuts at both Madrid and Barcelona airports this summer as part of a 
12% overall reduction in Ryanair's Spanish operations. Ryanair's traffic cuts will cause a combined loss of 3.1m 
passengers and over 3,100 jobs at Madrid (35% less flights) and Barcelona El Prat (23% less flights) while other

reversed but only when the Spanish Govt and its already high cost airport monopoly AENA reverse these unjustified

Ryanair | Published in: UK News[1]Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost airline, today (28 Nov) announced that in 
order to comply with the UK Office of Fair Trading's recent ruling on credit card fees it will introduce an avoidable 
2% credit card processing fee on all new credit card bookings made from 30 November, to cover credit card 
payment costs.
Ryanair's 2% credit card fee can be avoided by using debit cards (including Ryanair Cash Passport cards) or 
German ELV transfer. In addition, Ryanair's  6/£6 admin fee (which covers costs associated with Ryanair's website, 
www.ryanair.com[2]) will apply to all new bookings made from 30 November, except those bookings made using a 
Ryanair Cash Passport in Ireland, Germany and Spain, where admin fees can be avoided until 1 February, 15 
February and 21 March 2013, respectively. This will bring all of Ryanair's European operations in line with its UK 
procedures, following the OFT's ruling. Ryanair's Stephen McNamara, said: 'Ryanair continues to deliver the lowest 
fares and a no fuel surcharges guarantee to all our passengers. However, to cover our credit card processing costs 
and to comply with the UK OFT's recent ruling, we are introducing a 2% credit card handling fee from 30 November 
2012. Passengers can avoid credit card fees by paying for their ultra-low fares with a debit card or a German ELV 
transfer.
From 30th November, admin fees ( 6/£6) will apply to all new bookings, except bookings made with a Ryanair Cash 
Passport card in Ireland, Germany and Spain where Cash Passport cardholders can continue to avoid admin fees 
until 1February, 15 February and 21 March respectively.'

Nov 27, 2012 (Gulliver:http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/ Delivered by Newstex)
 THE deregulation of American air travel[1] was a near-unqualified success for cost-conscious travellers, who can 
now fly across the country far more cheaply than in the era of heavy regulation. There are more flights and they 
cost less. But deregulation was never completed. Even today, foreign carriers are forbidden from competing with 
American airlines in the domestic market. 
Clifford Winston, a scholar at the centrist Brookings Institution in Washington, took on this subject in a recent New 
York Times op-ed[2]. American airlines are taking advantage of reduced competition to cut capacity and raise 
prices, Mr Winston argues:
Unfortunately for travellers, this situation is unlikely to change anytime soon. With five airlines now serving 85% of 
the domestic market four, if American Airlines and US Airways merge, as industry analysts expect the major 
carriers are worrying less about the one factor that could disrupt their cosy, cram- em-in strategy: competition.
That is, unless policy makers do what they should have done a long time ago and allow foreign airlines, including 
discount carriers like Ryanair[3] and global players like Qantas[4] and British Airways[5], to serve domestic routes in 
the United States. Why, after all, should an industry that has ingeniously used free-market principles to squeeze the 
most revenue out of each middle seat be protected from competing in a real free market?
As things stand now, the United States allows foreign airlines to serve its major cities as part of international 
agreements conventions that have been around for decades. Foreign airlines have never posed a threat to national 
security or to the safety of air travellers; there s no indication that such carriers have resisted American security 
measures in the past or any reason to think they d violate any protocols required for domestic routes either.
As Mr Winston notes later in his op-ed, America's domestic airlines are likely to oppose the opening up of the 
country's market to foreign competition. Given the airlines' pull with both parties in Congress and the fact that airline 
labour unions would probably oppose this move, too it's unlikely that you'll be able to take British Airways from 
LaGuardia to Minneapolis anytime soon. But in the meantime, Mr Winston offers a plausible half-measure that 
could partially open the American air travel market without drawing too much fire from the domestic airlines. Instead 
of letting foreign airlines in fully (a pipe dream anyway), he writes, America could limit them to mid-size and regional 
airports that have "lost service in the past few years". That looks like a win-win: small and mid-size American cities 
get new flights, consumers get more competition, and foreign carriers get a foothold in the American market. It's an 
idea worth taking seriously.

 Continuing our series of notes from the Sohn London Investment Conference[1], next up is Nicolas Walewski of 
Alken Asset Management. He pitched 5 long ideas at the event: Ryanair, Grifols, Continental Tires, Gemalto, and 
Amadeus.
 Nicolas Walewski founded Alken Asset Management in 2005. Before that he was fund manager for the Oyster 
European Opportunities Fund.
 Walewski started by talking about the macro picture in Europe which he said was characterised by a lack of 
visibility. He argued that the European consumer will remain in recession for some time and so it is hard to know 
where to find value in Europe?
 His answer was to find businesses to invest in which have at least one or more of the following 3 characteristics: 
 1. Low cost business models
2. Oligopolies
3. Innovators
 He gave Ryanair as an example of a low cost business. Grifols and Continental Tyres as examples of oligopolies, 
and then Gemalto and Amadeus as innovators. Tiger Management's Julian Robertson likes Ryanair[2] according to 
his latest interview as well.
For the rest of the hedge fund presentations from this event, head to notes from Sohn London Investment 
Conference[3].

Ryanair | Published in: European News[1]Ryanair, Europe s only ultra-low cost airline, today (22 Nov) announced 
40% cuts at its Budapest base with the closure of 10 routes and loss of over 280 weekly flights from 10 Jan 2013 
after the Hochtief-run airport increased charges, refused to provide efficient facilities and failed to offer a 
competitive cost base for future growth offered by Ryanair. Ryanair s Budapest traffic will fall by 800,000 pax p.a. 
(from 2m to 1.2m pax) leading to the loss of up to 800  on-site  jobs*.
 Hochtief s failure to agree a long term growth deal with Europe s largest airline is further proof that Budapest 
Airport has no interest growing Hungarian tourism, traffic and jobs as it repeatedly increases charges even as its 
traffic declines. This was confirmed by Patrick Bohl (Budapest Airport) who recently admitted that  budget airline  
passengers pay more than Malev transfer passengers, with Budapest enjoying  probably the best recovery any 
airport has seen when they lost a national carrier.  These Budapest cuts (effective 10 Jan 2013) will include: 5 to 3 
based aircraft 30 routes to 20 (down 33%). From over 280 weekly flights to less than 170 (down 40%). 2m to 1.2m 
pax p.a (down 40%). Frequency cuts on 9 of 20 other routes The loss of 800,000 pax p.a. and 800  on-site  jobs at 
Budapest Airport. Ryanair regrets these cuts and confirms that they can be reversed if a competitive cost offer and 
efficient facilities become available at Budapest Airport. In Budapest today Michael O Leary said:  Ryanair regrets 
Hochtief Budapest Airport s decision to increase charges, impose inefficient facilities and reject our proposals for a 
competitive growth offer which would have allowed Ryanair to grow traffic and routes at Budapest. Ryanair will now 
switch 2 aircraft from Budapest with the loss of 10 routes, reductions on 9 others and the loss of 110 weekly flights. 
Sadly, 800,000 passengers p.a. and over 800 jobs will be lost by Budapest to other airports elsewhere in Europe, 
where Ryanair will continue to grow. With 1.2m passengers and 20 routes, Ryanair will remain one of the 2 largest 
airlines operating at Budapest, but Hochtief cannot continue to ignore the competitive marketplace, where airports 
all over Europe have been reducing costs and offering efficient facilities in return for traffic growth. We hope there is 
a way to reverse these cuts to ensure further Ryanair growth at Budapest.  RYANAIR S BUDAPEST ROUTE

Ryanair | Published in: UK News[1]Ryanair, Europe s only ultra-low cost airline, today (21 Nov) called on Atrapalo 
to hand over the  40,000 it was awarded by a Barcelona court to its misguided customers, who were charged 
hidden handling fees when booking Ryanair flights on the screenscraper website.
Ryanair has been fighting various cases across Europe to prevent its passengers from being subjected to 
excessive charges and to ensure Ryanair has appropriate contact details to communicate with its customers. Many 
screenscrapers have been: Mis-selling Ryanair flights with hidden mark-ups as part of packages; Failing to provide 
consumers with a proper breakdown of the flight price; Failing to provide Ryanair with passenger contact details 
which prevents Ryanair from communicating directly with passengers in the event of schedule changes or flight 
disruptions (similar actions by other travel agents resulted in thousands of passengers being left without any 
information during the 2010 volcanic ash airspace closures, as travel agents and screenscrapers failed to forward 
Ryanair information to passengers); Failing to provide Ryanair with passenger credit card details, which prevents 
passengers from receiving refunds directly from Ryanair; Failing to notify passengers of Ryanair s Terms and 
Conditions of Travel at the time of booking; Failing to notify Ryanair of special assistance requirements of 
passengers. In the interests of consumers and price transparency, Ryanair allows and encourages  price 
comparison only  websites to access its timetable and pricing information, for an annual charitable donation of just  
100. This allows them to compare Ryanair s guaranteed lowest fares with those of high fare airlines. Ryanair s 
licence agreement is open to all genuine  price comparison only  websites and already many have signed up, 
whereas Atrapalo has refused. Ryanair s Stephen McNamara said:  Ryanair has been fighting various cases across 
Europe to prevent our passengers from being subject to excessive charges and to ensure Ryanair has appropriate 
contact details to communicate with our customers. A Barcelona court recently awarded Atrapalo  40,000 and the 
screenscraper website recently asked how it should spend the sum. Ryanair is calling on Atrapalo to hand the 
money over to their misguided customers to refund the additional fees they have been charged by Atrapalo. 
Screenscraper websites have caused a number of difficulties for passengers and our message is simple: book 
directly on www.ryanair.com for the guaranteed lowest fares and best customer care.

 THE ONION has an interesting report[1] on American Airlines' plan to refocus its operations away from aviation 
towards publishing.
"Our first love is and always has been our travel and lifestyle magazine in fact, distributing American Way is the 
reason we first got into air travel back in 1930," said former American Airlines CEO and current American Way 
editor-in-chief Thomas Horton. "Sadly, the publishing industry is changing, and we can no longer afford to use the 
seat-back pockets of a major international airline to maintain our print circulation."
In similar vein, perhaps it's time for Ryanair to give up on flying and concentrate fully on the scratch-card business.

 Scandinavian airline group SAS has said negotiations with unions on massive job and pay cuts are making 
progress. There's only one day left to strike a deal and head off the firm's insolvency, management says. Embattled 
Scandinavian SAS Group, which operates the troubled Scandinavian Airlines, said on Monday marathon talks with 
trade unions on huge cuts were advancing well.
 Management indicated that all but one of the smaller unions had already thrown their weight behind a large 
package of cost-saving measures the company deems necessary to prevent SAS from having to file for insolvency.
 The airline group emphasized that a final deal with all sides concerned had to be reached in the course of Monday, 
after a former Sunday deadline was extended bilaterally.
 Cuts across the board
 SAS has not made a full-year profit since 2007, struggling to keep afloat in the fight against discount carriers such 
as Ryanair and Norwegian Air Shuttle.
 The company said it expected unions to agree to pay cuts of up to 15 percent, depending on which part of the firm 
they worked in. Cabin crew members for instance would have to accept a 12-percent drop in wages. There would 
also be cuts in pension claims, the firm added.
 SAS reiterated that the sale of regional airline Wideroe and the group's ground-handling unit would also have to be 
part of the deal, reducing overall staff to 9,000 from 15,000 at the moment.

 Vilnius: As Lithuania is preparing for the European Union (EU) presidency, flights to Brussels are becoming a 
headache. Negotiations with airlines to increase the number of flights do not seem to be successful.
 For the first time next year our country will preside over the EU Council. The preparations were started a long time 
ago but not everything goes as smoothly as expected. The idea is that while Lithuania presides over the EU 
Council, flights from Vilnius to Brussels and vice versa should operate at least twice a day according to the time of 
scheduled meetings since many high ranking officials will be coming to Lithuania from the entire EU. Our country s 
officials will also have to fly to Brussels and chair meetings there, says daily Lietuvos Rytas.
 Currently two airlines operate flights from Vilnius to Brussels. Belgium s Brussels Airlines have one flight every day 
except Saturdays, while Irish Ryanair operates flights to Charleroi airport three times a week. Lithuanian officials 
think that these flights will be not enough for the time when Lithuania will preside over the EU.
  Currently we have started negotiations with Brussels Airlines. So far we have only agreed on more convenient 
time but not on the additional flight,  says Director of Presidency of the EU Council, Ambassador Remigijus 
Motuzas.
 Also, recently negotiations with the airlines airBaltic were launched.

Ryanair | Published in: UK News[1]Ryanair, today (16 Nov) condemned the Govt-owned DAA airport monopoly s 
proposed price increases for 2013 which include;
 - increases in summer landing and passenger charges - increases in remote stand passenger charges - a 36% 
increase in wheelchair charges as unacceptable and irresponsible in the light of Dublin Airport s record low traffic 
figures and the Govt s much vaunted commitment to  The Gathering  in 2013. Since traffic at Dublin Airport has 
fallen over the last five years from 23m in 2007 to 18m in 2011, despite the opening of the DAA s  1.2bn T2, these 
latest price increases are unjustified at a time when Ireland s air passenger numbers and visitor numbers are 
operating at five year lows. The fact that the Govt is promoting  The Gathering  as its main tourism initiative in 2013, 
but has failed to address the lack of seat capacity growth, and has now stood idly by while its own airport monopoly 
raises prices to further gouge visitors in 2013 suggests that the  Gathering  is a sham. Ryanair s Stephen 
McNamara said:  There is no justification for the Govt owned DAA monopoly, at a time of recession and record low 
passenger numbers, further increasing the already high charges at Dublin Airport in 2013. These price increases, at 
a time when Minister Varadkar is calling on everyone to support  The Gathering  in 2013, shows that the Dept of 
Transport and the DAA haven t changed their high charging ways. Instead of lowering airport charges to support  
The Gathering , the DAA, backed up by the DOT, are yet again raising the already high prices at Dublin Airport 
even further in 2013. It s no secret that Dublin Airport s charges are among the highest in Europe. They have 
already been described by Aer Lingus as  insane  and by Etihad Airways as  too excessive . Minister Varadkar, to 
support  The Gathering , should be calling on the DAA monopoly to lower its airport charges in 2013, not raise 
them. These DAA proposed price increases in 2013 show that  The Gathering  is yet another vacuous tourism 
initiative by Govt under which visitors will again be ripped off by the Govt s own airport monopoly as they set foot in 
the country

Ryanair | Published in: UK News[1]Ryanair, Europe s only ultra-low cost airline, today (13 Nov) confirmed that the 
Irish Govt has failed to take up its offer to lower Ireland s EU Presidency air fare costs despite Ryanair delivering a 
low-fares proposal to Government last September, based on Ryanair s double daily return flights between Dublin 
and Brussels, which guarantees low fares for politicians and diplomats flying between the EU s headquarters and 
Dublin.
 Ryanair s proposal to Govt offered an unbeatable cost saving package which included: A fixed set one-way, 
unbeatable, fare of just  49.99 A  Presidency  helpline manned 18 hours a day Over 30 days  credit  Free flight 
changes Dedicated assistance desks at both Dublin and Brussels Charleroi airports Ryanair estimates that if just 
1,000 trips were taken by Irish and EU officials over this 6 month period, the Irish Govt would save over  3.5m 
during the EU Presidency. However, despite the offer being sent to Minister for European Affairs, Lucinda 
Creighton, on 20th Sept, Ryanair has yet to receive any reply or acceptance. Ryanair s Stephen McNamara said:  
Ryanair sent this very low cost travel proposal to the Irish Government on 20th September, well ahead of the EU 
Presidency in January, which delivers an unbeatable, guaranteed low fare of just  49.99 one way, to ensure that 
Ireland could minimise its travel costs during the EU Presidency. Sadly, the Irish Government has not even 
responded to this proposal which could save the Irish taxpayer millions of euro. With austerity and budget tightening 
now the focus of every EU state, it is time that governments stop wasting money flying with high-cost, frequently 
delayed, strike-ridden airlines like Aer Lingus. With Ryanair fares starting from just  49.99, civil servants can slash 
the amount of taxpayer money they waste and spend that money instead on much needed hospitals and schools 
here in Ireland. Sadly, it appears that this Government is all talk about savings, but there is no follow-up or action.

 SAS Group, which operates the troubled carrier Scandinavian Airlines, has announced massive job cuts and other 
cost-saving measures. The company says it's a final attempt to escape bankruptcy. Loss-making European aviation 
group SAS on Monday said it was planning massive job cuts as part of a large restructuring offensive to save the 
company from going bust.
 The group, which is the operator of troubled carrier Scandinavian Airlines, has not made a full-year profit since 
2007 as it struggles to survive in the fight against discount carriers such as Ryanair and Norwegian.
 SAS announced 800 jobs would be cut, with the sale of regional airline Wideroe and the group's ground handling 
unit reducing overall staff to around 9,000 from 15,000 at the moment.
 "This truly is our final call, if there is to be a SAS in the future," Chief Executive Rickard Gustafson said in a 
statement. "We have been given this final chance to make a fresh start and to carry on these fundamental 
changes."
 Drastic pay cuts
 Gustafson was referring to an agreement on credit facilities of 3.5 billion kronor (407 million euros, $518 million) 
with a consortium of banks and its main owners, including the governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. But 
the loans hinge on new collective agreements and parliamentary approval
 SAS said staff would have to take pay cuts of up to 17 percent, depending on what part of the firm they worked in, 
with cabin crew members facing a12-percent decrease in wages. CEO Rickard Gustafson added he would take a 
20-percent reduction.
 "I know we're asking a lot of our employees, but there's no other way, and I hope all are willing to fight for the 
survival of SAS," Gustafson commented. He said the company needed to get a deal with unions in place within a 
week.

 MINYANVILLE ORIGINAL While the election and imminent fiscal cliff dominated proceedings here in the US, there 
was no lack of news abroad either. A new study showed Italian students hate math the most[1], and who can blame 
them when their country's economic figures make for such depressing reading. 
Italy's Mario Draghi intimated that Europe's woes are now starting to impact even supposed economic behemoth 
Berlin, where industrial output skidded 1.8% in September. This in a week when several celebrated Teutonic 
musicians were exposed as a fraud[2], in much the same way made-in-Munich duo Milli Vanilli were a generation 
earlier. Clearly where Germany is concerned, we shouldn't take apparent success at face value. "Germans will 
crawl *******-naked over broken glass to get low fares[3]," according to Ryanair (RYAAY) CEO Michael O'Leary. 
Hopefully Angela Merkel Co also own some shares in the budget Irish air carrier, after it bucked an otherwise awful 
week in equities to advance 8.4% week. China answered the age-old riddle as to "Hu's[4] on first?[5]" after the 
OECD said the Asian economy is poised to overtake America in 2016. This means Barack Obama will now preside 
over the first time the US has forfeited top spot since the late 18th century. Mind you, the delegates convened by 
President Hu in Beijing's Great Hall of the People last week didn't exactly appear all that excited[6] at the prospect. 
A surprisingly lopsided Electoral College result spelled doom for Grand Canyon Education (LOPE), which went off 
its own fiscal cliff in imploding 8.6%. Our current Oval Office occupant was the first since FDR in the Depths of the 
Depression[7] to be re-elected with unemployment hovering around 8%. The 1930s were when coupon-clipping 
came of age[8] but there the similarities apparently end for Groupon (GRPN), which tumbled 27.9% to a new 
lifetime low. It's Veterans' Day, meaning banks and the bond market are both closed.
 Noteworthy economic data is also conspicuous by its absence this morning, although quarterly earnings 
announcements are expected out of Ambow Education (AMBO), Beazer Homes(BZH), Cubic Corp (CUB), D.R. 
Horton (DHI), Einstein Noah Restaurant Group (BAGL), Hologic (HOLX), Inergy Midstream (NRGM), Jacobs 
Engineering Group(JEC), National Bank of Greece (NBG), Spanish Broadcasting System (SBSA),Weatherford 
International (WFT), and Zoom Technologies (ZOOM).
Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): The drug stock is downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform by BMO Capital.
Caterpillar (CAT): The Dow (^DJI) component gets cut to Neutral from Buy at JPMorgan.
Garmin (GRMN): GRMN gets slashed to Sell from Neutral at Goldman Sachs.
JC Penney (NYSE:JCP[9]) Credit Suisse cuts the company, which fell sharply last week, to Underperform from 
Perform.
Johnson Johnson (JNJ): The Dow member gets moved to Hold from Buy at Jefferies.
Stock Downgrades: JC Penney Stops Making Cents
REITs: Kilroy Realty (KRC) and Vornado (VNO) are each cut to Neutral from Buy at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Ryanair (RYAAY): Citigroup cuts the low-cost Irish air carrier to Neutral from Buy after last week's strong showing.
Strayer Education (STRA): The stock is are moved to Neutral from Buy at JPMorgan.
Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX): Shares are now Neutral from Buy at Credit Suisse.

 Seat belts on airplanes are useless.
 That was the latest rant by Michael O'Leary, the chief executive for RyanAir, the ultra-low-cost airline based in 
Ireland.
 O'Leary, who opposes seat belts because he is pushing for standing-room sections of his planes, called aviation 
authorities who disagree with him "plonkers."
 "Seat belts don't matter," O'Leary told The Telegraph. "If there ever was a crash on an aircraft, God forbid, a seat 
belt won't save you."

 Nov. 09--Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary wants to yank out the last ten rows of his airplanes to create a standing-
room-only section, and says seatbelts on planes are pointless and that they won't save you in the event of a crash.

 O'Leary, called "the strangest CEO in air travel" by Business Insider [           http://www.businessinsider.com/x-
photos-of-ryanair-ceo-michael-oleary-looking-utterly-bizarre-2011-12] -- is seeking to implement "standing room 
only" seating (or standing) at the rear of his aircraft in an attempt to get more people on-board for lower prices.
 O'Leary is quoted in the Telegraph [           http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/aviation/9661829/Seatbelts-on-planes-
are-pointless-says-Ryanair-boss.html] as saying, "If there ever was a crash on an aircraft, God forbid, a seatbelt 
won't save you."
 He's probably right. But they might save a few injuries during particularly nasty turbulence -- also a fairly rare 
occurrence.
 He's also described airplanes as a "bus with wings." I can't argue with it. The days of wearing a suit and being 
served meals on china with silverware are long gone. Yet I can't imagine standing over the course of a lengthy 
flight. I'm pretty sure he's referring to shorter flights in and around Europe, rather than long hauls from Boston to 
Hong Kong. Still, I'll sit.
 Here's his hilarious description of the state of air travel:
 "The problem with aviation is that for 50 years it's been populated by people who think it's this wondrous sexual 
experience; that it's like James Bond and wonderful and we'll all be flying first class when really it's just a b-- bus 
with wings"
 Would you take a standing-room-only spot at the back of a plane for a much less expensive fare? Are seatbelts 
pointless?

 The CEO of cheapo Ryanair is now claiming that seatbelts on planes are useless and he should be able to sell 
standing room spots on his flights.
 Such a move could result in flights that cost those standing only a couple of bucks in Europe.
 Ryanair CEO Michael O Leary   insists that it would be totally safe because he s not saying the planes are going to 
go through areas of massive turbulence, so no one will get tossed around,  writes[1] the Consumerist.
 A few gems from a man known as, ah, quite frugal:  If there ever was a crash on an aircraft, God forbid, a seatbelt 
won t save you.   Seatbelts don t matter.   You don t need a seatbelt on the London Underground. You don t need a 
seatbelt on trains which are traveling at 120mph and if they crash you re all dead

 Investment analysts at Imperial Capital increased their target price on shares of Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ: 
RYAAY) from $36.00 to $40.00 in a note issued to investors on Tuesday. The firm currently has an  outperform  
rating on the stock. 
 The analysts wrote,  Maintaining our Outperform rating and raising one-year price target to $40 from $36.We 
believeF2Q s results demonstrate that Ryanair is among the fiercest competitors in the European market, exploiting 
its low-cost advantage and luring passengers with its exceptionally low fares. We believe the wave of European 
airline bankruptcies is far from over and expect Ryanair to not just pick up passengers, but also, potentially, very 
attractively-priced aircraft from the ashes. Quarter ended 9/30/12 results handily beat expectations.Ryanair reported 
second quarter EPS of  0.34 versus our  0.29 estimate and consensus of  0.24. While costs were consistent with 
our expectations, total revenue grew 17% year-over-year (yoy) to  1.8bn, which led to the  0.05 outperformance 
versus our model. Ryanair s scheduled revenue per passenger was  2.50 higher than our forecast, due to slowing 
capacity growth. Although cost per passenger excluding fuel increased 6%, the increase in the average fare drove a 
100bp increase in operating margin to 31.9%. Guidance raised significantly.Ryanair increased guidance to  490-520 
from  400-440. The company will again park approximately 80 planes during the winter, when demand is seasonally 
weak. Ryanair saves on fuel and landing fees using this approach, in addition to lifting the average fare on its 
remaining flights. Additionally, RYAAY is expecting full year fuel costs to increase only by  260mn, versus prior 
guidance of a  300mn increase. The company has been actively managing its fuel costs by ensuring pilots and 
ground crew adhere to policies that have helped RYAAY improve its fuel efficiency, such as flying slightly more 
slowly. Ryanair s costs are low even when compared to Spirit Airlines in the U.S.RYAAY s costs have long been 
well below other European flag carriers. Its costs are also well-below the U.S. ultra-low-cost carriers, like Spirit 
Airlines. The company estimates its costs are less than half those of Spirit, driven by much lower staff and airport 
costs. As we have written previously, Ryanair works aggressively to ensure that airport costs are low, partly by 
choosing the second or third airport in a city (like the Hahn airport instead of Frankfurt s main airport). The company 
also commented that because other nontraditional carriers are failing across Europe, airports not previously 
interested in Ryanair are now actively pursuing the carrier. We believe Ryanair still has plenty of growth left as more 
airlines exit and nascent markets such as Poland mature. 
 Shares of Ryanair Holdings plc traded up 2.26% during mid-day trading on Tuesday, hitting $34.36. Ryanair 
Holdings plc has a one year low of $27.66 and a one year high of $37.12. The company has a market cap of $9.900 
billion and a P/E ratio of 14.64.

economic crisis in the eurozone will continue to weigh on short-term inbound tourism demand. This means overall 
tourist arrivals and receipt growth rates could well slow over 2013.
The report also analyses the growth and risk management strategies being employed by some of the leading 
players in the local tourism sector (ie: airlines and hotel chains) as they seek to maximise the long-term growth 
opportunities offered by the Moroccan market.
In 2011, Morocco welcomed 9,342,302 tourists, an increase of 0.6% compared to 2010, according to information 
from the Ministry of Tourism. This was a disappointing outcome and reflected several factors: first, the economic 
crisis in the eurozone weighed on outbound tourism demand from the key source markets of France and Spain; 
second, the after-effects of the April 2011 suicide bomb attack on a popular tourist café in Marrakech, which killed 
16 people; and third, uncertainty ahead of the parliamentary election of November 2011   a period marked by 
several demonstrations across the country.
Although the election passed peacefully, BMI believes the other two negative factors (eurozone slowdown and 
lasting impact of Marrakech attack) will endure across 2012. Early indications are not encouraging, with arrivals for 
January-April reportedly down by 4% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 2.52mn, according to a report in the La Vie Eco 
newspaper in June. Passenger traffic at Moroccan airports was also down, by 4.73% y-o-y, over the January-
August. Given this poor start to the year, BMI forecasts that there will be a 5% decrease in tourist arrivals for 2012 
and a 7% fall in tourism revenue.
Over the past year, BMI has revised the following forecasts and views:
- BMI has become more negative on the outlook for Moroccan tourism, forecasting that growth rates for inbound 
tourism will slow to an average of 4.8% per annum across the new, extended forecast period to 2017, with risks to 
the downside if Europe's economy remains depressed.
- BMI believes Ryanair's decision to stop 34 weekly flights to and from Morocco in October 2012 will have a 
negative impact on inbound tourism arrivals, though other low-cost carriers are reportedly looking to take over from 
Ryanair on some services.
- BMI is also concerned that the tourism sector is not being as strongly promoted as it has been in recent years by 
the authorities. This is reflected in the lack of up-to-date data available through official government channels on key 
variables such as tourism arrivals and national hotel room capacity.

 AFTER witnessing the demise of its long-time rival Newsweek, Time magazine has turned its gaze towards 
another troubled business: the airline Virgin America. The magazine reports that despite consistently ranking near 
the top of "best airline" lists, Virgin America is "far from the best in the business at making money." It has lost 
$671m since 2007, and will be reducing flights and asking employees to go on furlough from early next year. Here's 
more:
Because Virgin America is young, it doesn t have a large a network of routes which is essential to attracting 
business travellers. And because Virgin America offers a premium product (leather seats, power outlets, fleet-wide 
Wi-Fi, live TV), its flights often aren t as cheap as competitors like Southwest and Alaska Airlines and low price is 
overwhelmingly important to leisure travellers. Speaking of competitors, they have regularly jumped into markets 
where Virgin America is operating, making it difficult if not impossible for Virgin America to be profitable.
[...]
Standing in sharp contrast to Virgin America s struggles is the rise of Spirit Airlines. Along with its fellow fee-crazed 
cohort across the pond, Ryanair, Spirit has been an airline travellers love to hate for years. And yet, despite the 
common complaints about Spirit customers have to pay even for water, and could get hit with $100 fees for carry-on 
bags the airline is likely the most profitable of any in the US.
So who is to blame if an airline that s comfortable and treats passengers well fails, while a carrier that annoys and 
nickel-and-dimes customers at every turn is a run-away success? We all are.
I'm sure the magazine has its numbers right, but this hasn't been my experience with Virgin America, which I fly 
frequently between Washington and San Francisco. I've found that Virgin America's ticket prices for that route are 
often the best of any airline offering non-stop flights, and I've been surprised to see that many of the flights are not 
particularly full. Of course, I've been travelling for business, and I really hate non-direct flights. Perhaps other 
travellers are more price-sensitive or don't mind switching in Chicago or Minneapolis.
That said, I'm not going to be dragged into feeling sorry for Virgin America as a company. Air travel has become 
increasingly commoditised, and Virgin America moved (so far fairly unsuccesfully) against that trend. For better or 
for worse, many air travellers have decided they don't mind being tormented as long as they get a cheap ticket. 
Virgin's competitors seem to be giving the people what they want. If Virgin can't find a way to make its business 
model work, I'll feel bad for its employees, and I'll miss the direct flights between DC and SF, but I won't be 
shedding tears. Business ain't beanbag.

 Filed under: North Korea, Airlines, Airline Reviews [ Image removed ]Let's take a poll: would you fly an airline rated 
the "world's worst"? No? Now tell us, if that same airline was owned by North Korea would you consider it any more 
worthy of your ticket price? Probably not, you say?
 The good news is that if you answered "yes" to any of the above questions, booking on Air Koryo just got a lot 
easier. The Skytrax one-star rated airline is selling its flights to China and Russia online for the first time.
 Although we're not sure that the website will add anything to the airline's reputation. According to the Telegraph:
 
 Early reports seems to suggest the website is unlikely to help the North Korean flag carrier shake its one-star 
rating, however. Users have already reported slow response speeds, with some searches not offering any 
availability for flights, while others result in an error message appearing on the screen.
 What happens on a one-star airline? According to Startrax: "very poor quality performance ... with poor, 
inconsistent standards of ... service ... in on-board and airport environments."
 At present, the airline utilizes a number of planes constructed in the former Soviet Union and is the only airline 
rated as one-star worldwide. That said, there are 29 airlines ranked just above this dubious distinction as two-star, 
which include names you may have flown, including Air Zimbabwe, Bulgaria Air and Ryanair.

 Tiger Management founder Julian Robertson made his rare television appearance for the year on CNBC yesterday 
and talked about how now is a time to put money to work in the market.
 He thinks the economy and overseas worries are having a big effect on investors. So many investors are 
frightened about Asia and Europe that they've almost "lost their way" without realizing that many great companies 
are trading at great prices.
 He feels that this market is good for hedge funds because their namesake allows them to hedge against 
uncertainty and these potential risks. However, he worries that some managers have hedged too much and they 
won't benefit unless there's a big fallout in the world economy.
 What Stocks Robertson Likes 
 Robertson cited Apple (AAPL) as great company trading at a great value, something he says rarely happens. He 
said, "Apple is now probably somewhere around 14-15 times next year's earnings, it's very, very reasonable for the 
kind of growth you can get."
 Facebook (FB) was another stock Robertson mentioned as he likes the social media exposure and admires Mark 
Zuckerberg. However, he does not "really know enough about the stock" to own a position. He cited "younger 
people" that he's in partnership with as having owned Facebook early on back when it was private. We'd assume 
he's referring to Chase Coleman's Tiger Global.
 Robertson says he's looking for great companies and he's invested in a European airway company: Ryanair 
(RYAAY) as they're the low-cost provider. He also likes Rolls Royce (LON:RR or RYCEY on the pink sheets) 
because many people see it as a luxury automobile when in reality it is a great supplier to the aerospace and other 
industries. Steve Mandel's Lone Pine Capital has been an owner of Rolls Royce.
 In terms of financials, Robertson cited Capital One (COF) and Ocwen Financial (OCN). The latter, he says, is a 
mortgage servicing company that he thinks has a lot going for them.
 Robertson argues that steel companies AK Steel (AKS), US Steel (X), etc are overvalued and we'd need to see the 
economy really takeoff to warrant those multiples.
Embedded below is the video of Julian Robertson's interview:

 New York, October 23rd (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) ended the 
trading 
session higher by $0.05 or 0.15% from its previous close. Ryanair's price action formed what is considered to be a 
bullish engulfing candle that could very well signal a continuation of trend or reversal of the ongoing weakness.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's recent stock range was formed by a trough where calculated support was defined at $27.6612 and by a 
peak that established the resistance level at $34.1. This range could be used by traders managing their positions.
Traders wanting to establish a position in Ryanair or traders that are already holding the stock can use the bullish 
engulfing pattern to their advantage. The pattern provides a defined risk, as it shows where the bears were able to 
push the stock down, before the bulls step in with a bid.

 Copthorne, United Kingdom, October 10, 2012 --(PR.com)-- Following the success of Great Britain's cycling teams 
this summer, specialist adventure holiday tour operator Explore has announced a 62% year-on-year increase in 
cycling holiday bookings and cycle shops around the UK have reported a significant increase in enquiries and sales 
of bicycles.(1) In order to help keen cyclists travelling abroad, Airport Parking and Hotels (APH) has compiled a 
comprehensive guide to airline allowances and charges for transporting bikes. The research is available in the 
Know Before You Go section of the website at            www.aph.com/bikes.
 The table compares the allowances of 26 airlines and highlights the checked-in free baggage allowance on both 
short and long haul flights, the added costs of transporting bicycles, the weight limit for each bag and any 
restrictions that are imposed.
 In terms of complimentary baggage allowance, Emirates was found to be the most generous airline allowing 30kg 
per economy ticket on long haul and short haul routes. Several airlines also allow two items weighing up to 23kg on 
routes to and from the US, while seven of the airlines - including Ryanair and easyJet - had no free baggage 
allowances, charging for all bags put in the hold.
 With regards to the transportation of bicycles, 11 of the 26 airlines surveyed allow bicycles as part of a customer's 
free baggage allowance, including British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, Ethiad and Singapore Airline. 
However, customers will be charged for exceeding the standard free allowance, with some airlines charging a fixed 
fee. Virgin, on the other hand, allows an item of sporting equipment in addition to the ordinary free baggage 
allowance.
 Of the other airlines surveyed, most charge a fixed fee for transportation of a bicycle. These range from £25.00 by 
easyJet if customers pre-pay for their bicycle online, to £157.50 by Air France on flights departing from a country 
outside the European Zone.
 Some airlines also impose restrictions on the packing of bikes with many airlines requiring bikes to be transported 
and in a bike box rather than a plastic bag. BMI, for example, asks for handlebars to be fixed sideways in line with 
the crossbar, pedals turned inwards or removed and the front wheel removed and fixed to the rear wheel.
 Nick Caunter, Managing Director of APH said, "Having your bike with you on holiday is a great way to explore and 
exercise at the same time. However, travelling with a bike can be awkward and expensive, so we wanted to provide 
a go-to-guide for consumers thinking about travelling by air with bicycles."

Oct 09, 2012 (Gulliver:http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/ Delivered by Newstex)
 A BLOGGER on the New York Times website has put together a list of his "Six Biggest Complaints About Business 
Travel". Tom Szaky, a businessman from New Jersey, is annoyed by the scarcity of power outlets in airports, seats 
that don't recline very far and that must be upright on landing, excessive in-flight announcements, check-in 
procedure, inconsistent lounge rules, and policies forbidding him to bring alcohol onto planes. It's an interesting 
grab-bag of ideas, though if these are the things that most annoy Mr Szaky, then his travelling life doesn't sound too 
awful.
A couple of the whinges resonate. I agree with Mr Szaky's resentment of unnecessary in-flight announcements, 
though this is more of a problem with low-cost carriers than with full-service airlines. (And noisy airlines are unlikely 
to quieten down any time soon. "Our services are not cathedral-like sanctuaries," said Ryanair's Michael O'Leary 
once. "Anyone who looks like sleeping, we wake them up to sell them things.") But, unlike Mr Szaky, I find it hard to 
object when airlines tell me that check-in closes 40 minutes or so before departure. It's not easy getting 200 people 
through security and onto a plane in organised fashion, and airlines certainly don't want massed ranks of 
passengers turning up mere minutes before departure. And it's sensible to discourage people from bringing their 
own alcoholic drinks on board; the passenger who's consumed six cans of lager during a five-hour flight will not 
make the most winsome of travellers. And then there's the requirement that seats be put in the upright position for 
landing. On the one hand, this compromises Mr Szaky's efforts to relax-a serious consideration indeed. On the 
other, it enables passengers to leave the craft more easily in the event of an accident. Hmm...

In response to the Philippines' very serious problem with sex trafficking, the government in power passed 
the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, which serves to outlaw cybersex, cam girls, and pretty much any scenario 
in which someone would think to point a web cam at their genitalia - sorry, ChatRoulette, but your days are 
apparently numbered. This move, which would effectively ban something like 95% of the Internet and also crack 
down on organized crime, is no doubt well-intentioned, but may prove difficult to enforce? Yes, we believe so.
The government seems to acknowledge that taking porn out of the Internet is right up there with the labors of 
Hercules as far as impressive feats go. The bill even goes so far as to establish a special police task force devoted 
to finding people shaking their naughty bits on the Internet, and identifying who they are shaking them for. 
Cybersex, for the purposes of the bill, is "the wilful engagement, maintenance, control, or operation, directly or 
indirectly, of any lascivious exhibition of sexual organs or sexual activity, with the aid of a computer system, for 
favour or consideration."
 So, yeah, definitely like, most of the Internet? This isn't the first time the nation has attempted a pretty strong 
crackdown on online sex, though. A pair of Swedish nationals who ran cybersex operation in the country were jailed 
for life last year. Oddly enough, the bill also seeks to make it illegal for non-Filipinos who are not even in the country 
to broadcast their sexy times and parts to the Phillipines.
 Journalists in the country also worry that the whole bill might be a trojan horse to crack down on freedom of the 
press, as it makes libelous comments made on blogs or websites a criminal offense punishable by up to 12 years in 
prison. So in short, there will be no more trolling or pornography on the Internet in the Philippines. You, uh, you let 
us know how that goes, guys.

Lufthansa launches new budget airline to keep costs in check
Lufthansa launches new budget airline to keep costs in check

German carrier Lufthansa has announced it will pool European flights with its Germanwings budget carrier after a 
re-launch of the low-cost airline in 2013. The move comes as Lufthansa grapples with mounting costs.
 Lufthansa's new low-cost carrier would have about 90 planes and start operations in January 2013, the German 
airline group said in a statement released late on Wednesday.
 The new division, whose name has yet to be decided, was scheduled to run all domestic and European short-haul 
flights outside of Lufthansa's main hubs Frankfurt and Munich.
 Lufthansa Chief Executive Christoph Franz said he expected "significant efficiency gains" from the new budget 
carrier, which would be based at Cologne-Bonn Airport.
 "Our aim is to once again fly these services profitably under the umbrella of a single company," Franz said.
 In Germany and Europe, the German airline is facing stiff competition from low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and 
Easyjet. Under a major restructuring program, Lufthansa aims to save 1.5 billion euros ($1.94 billion) by 2014, 
slashing more than 3,500 jobs.
 However, the airline saw net profit slump 24 percent to 229 million euros in the second quarter of 2012, and is 
currently locked in a fierce labor dispute with its cabin staff, who demand a pay rise of 5 percent and guarantees 
against outsourcing.
 Lufthansa shares gained significantly in early trading Thursday, as investors welcomed the launch of the new 
budget airline.
 Robert Czerwinsky, analyst with DZ Bank, rated the airline's shares as a clear buy.
 "The launch of the airline in the face of strong opposition from labor unions means good news for investors," he 
told news agency Reuters.

New York, September 19th (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) ended the 
trading 
session lower by $0.36 or -1.1% from its previous close. Ryanair's price action developed what can be considered a 
reversal pattern in the form of a tweezer bottom, which is a candlestick pattern that is usually formed at the end of a 
downtrend. The tweezer bottom is considered a reversal pattern, so traders will need to monitor the price action for 
confirmation.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Traders looking for an entry in Ryanair can use the tweezers as a good reference point to establish the long 
position, as the pattern provides defined risk by giving a good reference point for support.
Traders look for tweezer bottoms, as they provide an entry with a small defined risk. They are a leading indicator 
that provide an alert for a trend reversal or stabilization. The tweezers imply that bears or sellers were not able to 
push the stock lower, therefore providing the opportunity to look for a bounce. Below an example of a Tweezer

Filed under: Europe, Lithuania, Spain, Airlines, Transportation, Budget Travel, News, Consumer Activism [ Image 
removed: Ryanair fees ]Travelers taking issue with budget airline Ryanair is nothing new. In fact, it now seems to 
simply be commonplace.
 First, there was the Norwegian man who was arrested after complaining that the in-flight sandwich he purchased 
tasted like rubber. Then, of course, there were the passengers who staged a sit down strike in Belgium after being 
told they must take a bus 225 miles to their
final destination after being rerouted. The list really does go on from here.
 The ire doesn't stop with the passengers, however, as there was also the Ryanair pilot who was coincidentally 
transferred to Lithuania after publicly making remarks against the company, a move, which ultimately caused the 
veteran pilot to quit. Recently, there has even been talk of Ryanair making customers pay to use the lavatory.
 As usual, this can all be traced back to Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary who also wants to do away with co-pilots 
and has suggested that long-haul flights offer free oral sex.
 Oftentimes, such stunts are attributed to extreme marketing moves meant to gather attention, and it has seemed 
that recently Ryanair has backed off a bit from their ludicrous outcries.
 Or, maybe not.
 According to a recent Time Business article, when a passenger traveling from Alicante, Spain, back home to 
England complained of Ryanair charging her a fee of (EURO)60/person to print boarding passes for her family of 
five (a total of $390), Time reports that O'Leary branded the woman as "stupid" and called the rest of Ryanair 
passengers "idiots." Continue reading Woman Pays Ryanair $390 To Print Boarding Passes, CEO Calls Her

Written by: EasyJet PLC | Published in: UK News easyJet, Northern Ireland's largest airline, today appeared before 
the House of Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee to give evidence on the air transport strategy for 
Northern Ireland and highlight easyJet's long term commitment to serving the region.
Speaking at today's House of Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, Paul Simmons, the airline's UK 
Director said: "easyJet started its Belfast operation on 18 Sept 1998; we have a local base located at Belfast 
International Airport and we directly employ over 230 local people.
 In Northern Ireland easyJet has grown over the past 14 years to become the largest airline in the region with a 
market share of 46%, serving 23 destinations direct from Belfast International Airport. easyJet also fly to 4 London 
airports offering passengers the best access to London. By way of comparison Aer Lingus has 8% market share, 
and with BMI taken into account British Airways has 7% of market share.
 Northern Ireland has seen several airlines come and go from Belfast, but easyJet's consistence in the Northern 
Ireland market and experience of carrying over 34 million passengers since its launch in the region makes it well 
placed to give evidence on matters affecting local people and the local economy in terms of air transport.
 Airport Passenger Duty (APD) however, remains one of the most significant barriers to growth in Northern Ireland, 
with local people being disadvantaged when they fly to UK destinations such as London, Manchester and Scotland 
as they are hit twice with tax. This is an unfair tax overall, but it's especially unfair for the people of Northern Ireland. 
And if this tax is increased, it will have a serious impact on tourism.
 Like British Airways, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic, we continue to call on the Government to publish an independent 
study of the economic effects of APD. We are confident such a study would show that APD's damage to economic 
activity outweighs the revenue obtained. We believe that it is irresponsible of the Treasury, if it is serious about 
pursuing economic growth, to keep piling on APD increases without conducting a study of this kind."

RyanAir CEO Michael O'Leary made headlines this week when he argued that a customer in Spain deserved to pay 
$380 for having RyanAir print a boarding pass. He went even further when he said that "all passengers are stupid 
who think we will change our policies or our fees". I've been thinking about this statement all morning and I can't 
shake the bad taste it's left in my mouth. Having lived in Europe for five years and being a patron of RyanAir, I can 
see why my impression of the airline was dead on and here are the lessons that I took from O'Leary's statement.
Just because you can doesn't mean you should
I understand O'Leary's logic of charging for convenience, that's what most customers want. My issue comes with 
how much he charges for the convenience. Some will argue that if the convenience is worth it the customer they will 
pay it, but on an airline if you don't have the boarding pass you can't get on the flight. So the charge is really a 
hostile convenience charge.
Flexibility is a sign of business acumen
The rigid adherence to airline's policies screams to me a lack of strategy by O'Leary and his management team. In 
an industry that is struggling to make revenue on its core service, the jump to ancillary charges should shine a 
spotlight on the airline's inability to generate revenue on its core service. Now some may say that the move to 
monetize ancillary services is an adaption strategy, but RyanAir has shown that ancillary charges are really its only 
business model.
You walk a fine line between reputation and revenue
Sure RyanAir rose to fame being a no-frills airline, but at what point do you stop being no-frills and start being a 
rock in your drowning customer's pocket? Call me naïve, but I actually like the fact that my clients view me as a 
resource not just an expense. Isn't that what you are supposed to strive for in business? Shouldn't the ultimate goal 
be fulfilling a need, not creating another revenue stream for your competitors?
 Business can be a ruthless path, with customers often left to fend for themselves but the one thing that I love about 
being a small business is that I can bend the rules for clients who really deserve it. There are things that I can't 
touch, but with office policies and pricing policies you have to really think which one is more important, this sale or 
my future sales?

· LUFTHANSA is struggling to deal with its biggest ever strike by cabin crew, who downed tools on Friday for the 
third time in eight days. The airline had to cancel around 1,000 flights, and rivals have been operating larger planes 
to transport stranded Lufthansa customers. The dispute pits cabin crew seeking 5% pay increases against an airline 
trying to cut (EURO)1.5 billion from its expenses by 2014.
· Hotel fees in America are soaring and are expected to hit record highs this year, according to Time.com. Research 
from NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies suggests fees should reach $1.95 billion in 2012, a 
$100m increase on 2011. The rise is not, apparently, due to an increase in the actual number of fees, but an 
increase in occupancy rates and the fees charged.
· Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair, had not said anything controversial for a while, so duly corrected that 
oversight this week. He suggested that a woman who launched a Facebook campaign after she was required to 
pay (EURO)300 to print off five boarding passes for a Ryanair flight was "stupid". And he added that, in general, 
customers failing to print out the passes could "bugger off".
· And this week's biggest story... Some British Airways passengers arriving at Heathrow Terminal 5 on Monday 
were left bagless after raw sewage from a broken pipe sprayed onto around 100 bags. Heathrow kindly took the 
items away for cleaning.

New York, September 6th (TradersHuddle.com) - Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) closed the trading 
session higher by $0.13 or 0.42% from its previous close. The latest price action developed a short term reversal 
pattern in the form of a tweezer top, which is a 
candlestick pattern that is usually formed at the end of an uptrend. Given that the tweezer top is considered a 
reversal pattern, traders with long positions need to monitor the price action for confirmation of weakness, and plan 
the position accordingly.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's stock has been in a defined range with calculated support at $27.66 and resistance at $31.64. Given the 
possibility of short-term weakness in the stock's price, this range could be used by traders managing their positions.
Tweezer tops are exactly the opposite of tweezer bottoms, as they define a resistance point for Ryanair that needs 
to be digested prior for the stock to move to a higher level.
Tweezer tops can be formed at the end of an uptrend, at a clear horizontal resistance point, or within a downtrend 
when price action is dealing with the declining resistance trend. Like any other candlestick pattern, it needs 
confirmation by trading below the previous day low. Below there is an example of the Tweezer Top reversal pattern:

Sept. 05--Mild day, but anyone complaining? Three more weeks of this, please. With rain over night, if that's not too 
much to ask. Let's get linking:
 CUSTOMER SERVICE The latest airline fee: charging you for printing out your boarding passes. You're thinking: 
great. A dollar here, a dollar there, it's always something. Wrong: Sixty Euros. Per pass. For a family of five, that's 
$377. Suzy McLeod printed off her passes for the flight out, but since she was staying in a somewhat remote locale, 
and you can't print them off weeks in advance, she got hit with the charges. She took to Facebook to complain. You 
imagine 
how 
the 
airline 
responded. 
Can't 
you? 
Why, 
the 
CEO 
of 
Ryanair 
himself 
responded. 
[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/9522191/Ryanair-boss-slams-idiot-who-forgot-boarding-pass.html]
 "She wrote to me last week asking for compensation and a gesture of goodwill. To which we have replied, politely 
but firmly, thank you Mrs McLeod but it was your ****-up."
 He claimed that 99.98 per cent of Ryanair passengers did print their boarding passes in advance: "To those who 
don't, we say quite politely: 'B***** off'".
 Everyone always says "I'll never fly that airline again" until they do, because there's no other choice.
 AMUSING . Meet Xavius, the world's most influential Instagram photographer. You know those people you want to 
flay with a cheese grater because they post pictures of sushi run through a desaturation filter? Consider them 
flayed:

 The scenes in which he uses the iPad were painful to watch, because A) no human being looks like anything less 
than an idiot taking a picture with an iPad, and B) I was taking pictures with an iPad at the Fair last week. Oh, I was 
fully justified. Testing out an app. But I knew I looked like a pretentious doofus -- and to make matters worse, I was 
using a tripod. Any real photographer would have been justified by walking up and slapping me.
 Speaking of social apps: You might like Timehop [http://timehop.com/], which sends you an email every day telling 
you what you were doing a year ago on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Foursquare, in case you've forgotten all 
about that day you were mayor of Chipotle in Edina for 17 hours. It sounds like a cool service for people whose 
infinite self-regard makes them want to archive their sneezes, if they could -- but it also means that fashionable 
filters will appear in your inbox a year later, and you'll wince.
 This isn't to say that filters aren't useful. Used sparingly, and correctly, they are. But we are in a curious phase in 
Western Civilization when people want to take pictures of their feet at the beach and desaturate the image, then 
add reds and yellows to make it look as if the picture was shot in 1976 and the chemicals have decomposed. So 
retro! Vintage! I bought a cheap point-and-shoot the other day to replace an older point-and-shoot, and it has a "toy

convenient; with a watch, you just glance at your wrist. A phone you have to get out and turn on. Might as well go 
back to watches on chains in vest pockets.
 Determined, perhaps, to make the watch popular again, some designers have revisited the basic watch, and come 
up with some fascinating reinterpretations:

love this line: "According to the manufacturer, a person (given enough practice) will be able to read the time using 
this watch as easily as reading time on an ordinary watch." That's what most people want in a watch. Something 
that requires practice to understand.

mindless reproduction, and painful death. Repeat as needed.
 The scientists have named the insect Conlephasma enigma.
 "We have named the new stick insect with the specific epithet "enigma" because its systematic position in the tree

Ryanair are in trouble again. Photocredit: Karen V Bryan The background
Oh dear, Ryanair's at it again - the famously "no-frills" airline is now under fire for charging a mother to print out her 
boarding passes. Suzy McLeod complained that she was charged £236 to print out five boarding passes when she 
was flying back from Spain with her family. This despite the fact that she had the passes as a PDF on her phone. 
She'd left England 15 days previously, so she couldn't print the passes, as you can only do that 14 days before your 
return flight.
 Passengers using Ryanair are expected to check in over the internet, and to print their boarding cards before 
travel; if they don't, they're charged £60 (if flying from the UK; it's 60 euros if you're flying from Ireland, which 
currently means that British passengers pay 25 per cent more.) McLeod complained on a Facebook page, asking 
people to "like" her comment if they agreed; she soon had 358,000 "likes", and more than 18,000 comments. Her 
flights were advertised at £166 per person, but after priority seating, baggage fees and the passes, they had to pay 
£1,650 in total.
 Many users agreed with her; others said that however the carrier made it clear that there would be charges for 
boarding passes.
 "We had to scrap every penny we had in cash on us to pay it. It was stressful and unnecessary. I don't think we'll 
use them again. We wouldn't even consider them," said Suzy McLeod of Ryanair, quoted on The Telegraph.
What Ryanair said
The company's spokesman, Stephen McNamara, said, quoted on The Telegraph, that it was clear that there would 
be charges if passengers didn't print out their cards.
Ryanair are wrong!
Stephen Glover on The Mail said that he was pleased holiday season was over, as the stress of air travel could be 
avoided for another year. Suzy McLeod's experience certainly chimed with him - something similar happened to his 
son. Like most people on holiday, she had no access to a printer "and - silly woman! - had ommitted to bring a 
portable printer with her." Ryanair could have printed them for free. Sure, it's in the small print, but that doesn't 
make it right - this is "little better than extortion." Ryanair just doesn't care about its public relations. Why is air travel 
"so stressful"? When home, "you often need another holiday - if that did not involve flying again."
Ryanair are right!
Archie Bland in The Independent said that he'd never been "hotter with righteous indignation" than when he 
boarded a Ryanair flight without his boarding pass. And yet, Suzy McLeod doesn't "have a leg to stand on." If you 
Mother made to pay for Ryanair boarding passes: but who's in the right?
have "the wit to actually pay attention to the terms and conditions," or "the basic organisational capactiy to use a 
printer," then you won't have a problem. You can't blame Ryanair, just as you can't blame "cinemas that charge too 
much for hot dogs, or the phone companies that give you a free handset and a whacking monthly bill." They have to 
make their businesses "viable enough to offer you a good deal." If you don't want the penalty, then pay extra for a 
British Airways flight. "And they might even throw in some complimentary peanuts."

New York, August 17th (TradersHuddle.com) - Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) closed the trading 
session higher by $0.05 or 0.17% from its previous close. The latest price action developed a short term reversal 
pattern in the form of a tweezer top, which is a 
candlestick pattern that is usually formed at the end of an uptrend. Given that the tweezer top is considered a 
reversal pattern, traders with long positions need to monitor the price action for confirmation of weakness, and plan 
the position accordingly.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's stock has been in a defined range with calculated support at $27.66 and resistance at $29.89. Given the 
possibility of short-term weakness in the stock's price, this range could be used by traders managing their positions.
Tweezer tops are exactly the opposite of tweezer bottoms, as they define a resistance point for Ryanair that needs 
to be digested prior for the stock to move to a higher level.
Tweezer tops can be formed at the end of an uptrend, at a clear horizontal resistance point, or within a downtrend 
when price action is dealing with the declining resistance trend. Like any other candlestick pattern, it needs 
confirmation by trading below the previous day low. Below there is an example of the Tweezer Top reversal pattern:

Online gambling and betting are highly regulated worldwide - these activities are almost entirely banned in the USA 
and in Latin America, online gambling and betting are only fully legal in Argentina and Chile. In Europe, the situation 
varies from country to country and in the Asia-Pacific region, online gambling is only legal in the Philippines. The 
mobile segment accounted for less than one percent of the global market until 2011, but is expected to grow rapidly 
in the future. 
Great Potential on the entire American Continent
The ban on online gambling websites in most parts of the USA has spurred the use of offshore sites. Nonetheless, 
only a single-digit percentage figure of all US Americans participate in online gambling, while almost 50 percent 
play lotto. In Canada, the government started opening the market for online gambling in 2011 to generate higher tax 
income. In South America, online gambling and betting increased in popularity in 2011, generating more than 100 
billion EUR in gross revenue.
European Online Gambling experiences strong Growth
Online gambling and betting have been legalized in an increasing number of European countries since 2011, with 
the UK starting the trend. There, individuals aged 18 to 34 are the most active. Even though in Germany online 
casinos and online poker were only legalized in Schleswig-Holstein in 2012, gross revenue from online gambling is 
expected to total nearly 2 billion EUR nationwide in 2015. In France, cash games generated most online revenue 
ahead of horse race betting, while online gambling market revenue on the Spanish market is expected to more than 
double between 2011 and 2014. Norway and Sweden were still dominated by state monopolies in 2011. In the 
Czech Republic, the market was tightly regulated in 2011 and in Turkey, online gambling is banned altogether in 
2012. 
Online Gambling Laws in the Asia-Pacific Region remain restrictive
Online gambling is illegal in Japan and China, except for the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and 
Macau. After the first successful year for traditional casinos in Singapore, in 2011, laws to legalize online casinos 
were discussed as well. In Australia, only foreign visitors were allowed to participate in online gambling due to the 
Commonwealth Interactive Gambling Act 2001.
Online Gambling Operators expand Sales Strategy
In 2012, online gambling operators discovered the social network Facebook as an opportunity to widen their reach. 
PokerStars, the worldwide leading online poker website by active players, expanded its operations to Spain in June 
2012. Further leading online poker sites worldwide include PartyPoker, iPoker, and Ongame. The latter is owned by 
online gambling company Bwin.Party, which is considering selling Ongame to social gaming giant Zynga. 
Meanwhile, OPAP, Europe's largest betting company, plans to include online gambling in its offering starting in the 
Global Online Gambling and Betting Report 2012
third quarter of 2012. 888.com   an online gambling website   has been cooperating with Ryanair since February 
2012 to offer in-flight services. Canadian gambling website Bodog was shut down in February 2012 based on a 
suspicion of taking part in illegal gambling, leading to the company's relocation to Asia under the name Bodog88. 
EverestPoker has to deal with issues, too. The online poker site experienced a decrease in active players of more 
than 40% in the fourth quarter of 2011, combined with a revenue decline of over 30%.
The global online gambling market is obviously in upheaval: new laws are introduced, sales strategies adapted and 
new revenue potentials explored. 
Key Highlights
  In 2011, "Betting" was the highest grossing activity in global interactive gambling.   In the USA, almost half of all 
inhabitants were "Playing the Lottery", while only a single-digit percentage number participated in "Online 
Gambling" in 2011.   Beginning in 2012, the UK saw increasing opportunities for live online casino services, with 
more and more online gamblers aware of this gambling method.   Online gambling revenues in Germany are 
projected to grow with a compound annual growth rate of almost +20% until 2015.   Online gambling was banned in 
most Asian countries as of 2012, but consumers were generally interested in gambling.

Aug. 08--So it's now official that Las Vegas-based Allegiant Air will start flying weekly flights from Spokane to Oahu.
 The story [http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2012/aug/07/airline-announces-nonstop-service-between-spokane-/] 
appeared on Spokesman.com earlier today. Some notable and not well-known facts about low-fare Allegiant. It flies 
into and out of 80 cities, including Bellingham, Wash. Which tells you how competive Allegiant has to be, if they 
choose to set up flights in and out of places like Missoula and Bellingham.
 Also notable is some of its operating philosophy. It chooses about a dozen destination locations and then forms 
routes from smaller cities to those destinations. Yes, Allegiant.com [http://Allegiant.com/] lists Bellingham as a little 
gem of a getaway.
 Here's another key part of their approach: The airline uses the Ryanair model of looking for secondary revenue 
through sales of food, beverages, and souvenirs on board as well as charges for checking luggage and advance 
seat assignments. Which means, the current discount rate of $180 one-way to Oahu doesn't stay that low when you 
start adding in other costs, like luggage. The St. Petersburg Times reported that the airline's average "extra" 
revenues came to $33.35 per passenger in 2011.
 And a Wikipedia [           http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiant]entry added this nugget of insight: "Allegiant CEO 
Maurice Gallagher stated in an article that appeared September 2009 issue of Fast Company that the advantages 
of this pricing structure was psychological. He went on to say, 'We collect $110 from you at the end of your trip. If I 
tried to charge you $110 up front, you wouldn't pay it. But if I sell you a $75 ticket and you self-select the rest, you 
will.' "

EULOGIES for Ryanair's customer service are rare, so here's one for you.
On July 23rd, my wife booked a flight to France for early the following morning in order to attend a funeral. For 
various reasons the funeral was then postponed, and the ticket became useless. So at 5.45pm on the 23rd, 15 
minutes before the customer-service line was due to close for the day (and 12 hours before Mrs Gulliver was due at 
Luton airport) she rang Ryanair and explained to a very nice woman what had happened and why. "I'll need to 
speak to Head Office about that," came the reply. "But they work till 7pm, so please ring them in an hour on this 
number."
Before my wife could make the call, the woman from customer services rang back. "We can cancel the flight," she 
said, "if that's what you want." That's precisely what my wife wanted. So Ryanair cancelled the booking, and gave 
her a full refund. That's right: a full refund. The money was in our bank account within 24 hours. According to the 
"Pre-Flight Changes" section of the company website, "All Ryanair flights are fully changeable but cannot be 
cancelled." It seems that is not, in fact, wholly true. Rather than point my wife to its rules and head home for the 
day, which is what we were expecting, Ryanair's staff listened to her story and made the decision to help. Good 
work.

MINYANVILLE ORIGINAL Groupon (GRPN) gapped down 9.09% to a fresh low, and if such a showing is enough to 
again drive its CEO to drink, shareholders will hope it is with Diageo (DEO) after the Guinness-maker gained 1.29% 
to hit an all-time high. And soon after comments by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi sent stocks to 
their best two-day surge all year, he was dismissed by one leading economist as the "leader of NATO   No Action, 
Talk Only." Yet verbal diarrhea is surely far preferable to constipation. Especially after Progenics Pharmaceuticals 
(PGNX) slid 50.09% on news its medicine to treat the latter aliment was rejected for extended use.

While Ryanair saw profits slump by a third, Air France-KLM even posted a huge loss in the second quarter of 2012. 
High fuel costs, low consumer spending and the euro crisis are compounding the woes of Europe's carriers. 
Ryanair posted a net profit of 99 million euros ($121 million) in the months April through June, which was 29 
percent less than in the same quarter a year ago.
 Europe's biggest budget airline said Monday that passenger numbers had climbed six percent to 22.5 million, 
which had boosted second quarter revenues 11 percent to 1.28 billion euros.
 However, the result was weighed on heavily by rising fuel and oil costs, which had soared 27 percent to 543.8 
million euros.
 In addition, the weak economic outlook for Europe had restrained growth.
 "There is no sign of a European-wide economic recovery,   and no light at the end of the tunnel," Ryanair's Chief 
financial Officer Howard Millar told Reuters Insider TV.
 Millar also announced that Ryanair would ground 80 of its 270 planes over the winter, adding that in view of oil 
prices at $100 per barrel "it really doesn't make sense to fly these aircraft."
 Despite the problems, Ryanair said that it would maintain its profit outlook of between 400 million euros to 440 
million for 2012.
 Air France-KLM flies into the red
 Even worse hit by the crisis in the airline business is Franco-Dutch airline operator Air France-KLM which reported 
a steep loss of 895 million euros ($1.1 billion) in the second quarter of 2012.
 The result compares unfavorably with a loss of 197 million euros a year earlier, but was primarily the result of 
"restructuring provisions" to the tune of 368 million euros, the airline said Monday.
 In January, Air France-KLM announced a three-year restructuring plan, seeking to eliminate 5,122 jobs with the 
aim of saving 2.0 billion euros by 2015.
 Group chairman Jean-Cyril Spinetta said that uncertainty in the global economy, coupled with oil price and 
exchange rate volatility, would make improving the group's productivity "even more necessary."
 Air France-KLM's revenue rose 4.5 percent to 6.5 billion euros, lifted by a 2.4 percent increase in passenger 
numbers to 55.4 million in the second quarter. But cargo was down 6.9 percent in the three months.
 Germany's national carrier Lufthansa will release its results for the second quarter on Thursday.
 Analysts are eager to learn how Europe's biggest airline is faring after announcing it would cut 3,500 jobs in view of 
a record loss of $521 million in the first quarter of 2012.

Investment analysts at Imperial Capital began coverage on shares of Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ: RYAAY) in a 
note issued to investors on Monday. The firm set an  outperform  rating and a $36.00 price target on the stock. 
 The analysts wrote,  In an era where European airlines are struggling and several have failed, Ryanair has 
produced consistent profits. With nonstandard service to many lesser-known airports, RYAAY has grown to carry 
more Intra-European passengers than any other airline, even more than the long established national airlines, 
British Airways, Lufthansa, and Air France. On several occasions, as smaller carriers have failed, RYAAY has 
stepped in to replace the service, often on short notice, creating additional opportunities for growth for the company. 
 Ryanair Holdings plc opened at 29.45 on Monday. Ryanair Holdings plc has a 1-year low of $23.87 and a 1-year 
high of $37.12. The company has a market cap of $8.573 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of 12.86.
 RYAAY has been the subject of a number of other recent research reports. Analysts at HSBC downgraded shares 
of Ryanair Holdings plc from an  overweight  rating to a  neutral  rating in a research note to investors on Monday, 
June 11th. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase downgraded shares of Ryanair Holdings plc from a  neutral  rating to an  
underweight  rating in a research note to investors on Wednesday, June 6th.
 Ryanair Holdings plc (Ryanair Holdings) is the holding company for Ryanair Limited (Ryanair). Ryanair operates a 
low-fares, scheduled passenger airline serving short-haul, point-to-point routes between Ireland, the United 
Kingdom, Continental Europe and Morocco.

July 25--A few years ago, I wrote a column about what the fee-laden airline of the future would be like. 
[http://www.chron.com/business/steffy/article/Coming-soon-more-airline-fees-than-you-can-count-1771764.php]I 
wrote it tongue-in-cheek, but it grows less funny as airlines move closer to making it reality.
 Fees, of course, have become big business for the airlines. This week, IdeaWorksCompany released its analysis of 
airline fees [http://www.ideaworkscompany.com/wp-contentuploads201207press-release-70-ancillary-revenue-top-
10-pdf], or as its known in the industry "ancillary revenue." The study, sponsored by Amadeus, found annual fee-
related revenue at 50 international airlines jumped 66 percent in the past two years to $22.6 billion.
 [           http://blog.chron.com/lorensteffy/files/2012/07/ffgraphic.jpg]
 All those bags are going to cost you -- even if you carry them on (Fotolia)
 At the top of the list was United Airlines, with $5.2 billion, or $36.47 per passenger. It was followed by Delta Air 
Lines and American Airlines at $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. Southwest Airlines has made marketing 
hay out of not charging for bags, but it still generated the fifth-highest fee revenue at $1.2 billion, charging for things 
such as early check-in and in-flight WiFi. [           http://www.southwest.com/html/customer-service/travel-
fees.html?int=GNAVTRAVELFEES]
 Spirit Airlines, not surprisingly, leads the world in fees as a percentage of total revenue: 33.2 percent.
 Airlines, in other words, have tapped a gusher. They've found away to squeeze more money out of existing 
passengers, and they aren't about to stop. Some carriers, including United, have already begun raising fees for last-
minute flight changes. [           http://www.airfarewatchdog.com/blog/4680772/chart-changes-to-same-day-flight-
changes/]
 Spirit, meanwhile, charges for carry-on bags and for booking a reservation. As Bill McGee points out, these fees 
may 
soon 
become 
common 
practice 
with 
other 
carriers 
as 
well. 
[ 
 
 
 
 
 
     
http://travel.usatoday.com/experts/mcgee/story/2012-07-25/What-airline-fees-are-coming-next/56470558/1]McGee 
suggests studying the websites of Ryanair [           http://www.ryanair.com/en] and Spirit [           
http://www.spirit.com/Default.aspx], because they are the industry's unabashed fee pioneers. Ryanair once 
proposed pay toilets on its planes.
 As the use of fees grows, airlines must do a better job of disclosing them at the point of sale. Airlines have fought 
new government rules that require more transparency in pricing -- Spirit tried to charge a $2 "unintended 
consequences fee" for complying with the rules [           http://consumerist.com/2012/03/spirit-airlines-sued-over-2-
unintended-consequences-fee.html] -- but an appeals court recently upheld the rules [           
BLOG: Loren Steffy: What will airlines charge fees for next?
http://consumerist.com/2012/07/sorry-airlines-court-says-you-have-to-tell-the-truth-about-airfares.html], 
saying 
airline price quotes can deceive the public because they're often significantly lower than the actual cost of travel.
 Despite the government's efforts to make airlines disclose full travel costs more clearly, fees are here to stay. 
Given the economics of the airline business, most carriers would rather collect fees than actually fly. A few years 
ago, it sounded like a joke, but can fees for pressurizing the cabin or a successful landing be far off?

AIRLINES earned  18.23 billion ($22.6 billion) in ancillary revenues in 2011, a 66% increase on 2009. Analysis by 
IdeaWorks, a consulting organisation, and Amadeus, a company that provides technology to the travel industry, of 
the 50 airlines that disclose ancillary earnings (three more than last year) highlights the profound importanace of 
ancillaries to an industry that often struggles to make profits. Several carriers earned over 20% of total revenues 
from these add-on charges in 2011, and several earned over  30 per passenger.
United Continental is by some distance the biggest ancillary earner, raking in more than  4 billion in 2011, ahead of 
Delta, which took just over  2 billion. Low-cost carriers may be more traditionally associated with ancillary-revenue 
streams than legacy airlines, but they don t appear till fifth place in the overall list, with Southwest taking $950m, 
ahead of easyJet on $890m and Ryanair on $886m. Southwest, remember, does not charge for baggage.
Budget airlines dominate the table that ranks airlines by the proportion of their total income derived from ancillary 
sources. The top ten airlines according to this metric are all low-cost. Spirit Airlines is most reliant on ancillaries, 
earning over 33% of its income that way in 2011, followed by Jet2 and Allegiant on 27%. The third table issued by 
IdeaWorks looks at ancillary revenues per pasenger. Qantas top this list, snaffling over  40 a head on average 
thanks mainly to a frequent-flyer programme that generated  896m last year.

TWELVE airlines agreed recently to include debit-card charges in their advertised prices for passengers who book 
online. Aer Lingus, BMI Baby, Eastern Airways, EasyJet, Flybe, German Wings, Jet2, Lufthansa, Ryanair, Thomas 
Cook, Thomson and Wizz Air will reveal the fees as part of their main price listings, rather than after customers 
have already made it through most of the booking process. The change comes after the Office of Fair Trading 
(OFT), a British regulatory body, complained that online, debit cards are the "equivalent of cash".
The OFT is right, of course, that charging an add-on fee for what amounts to a cash payment is nonsense. It's hard 
to imagine any significant portion of travellers who book online pay with anything other than a debit or credit card. 
Airlines will still be able to add extra fees late in the process for credit-card bookings, but credit cards often feature 
far higher interchange fees than debit cards. There's no reason to expect merchants to charge the same amounts 
for all forms of payment, especially when some forms of payment cost merchants much more. But it's perfectly fair 
to ask, as the OFT did, that fees be revealed up-front. 
What this really shows is the power a determined regulator has to change behaviour industry-wide. "We made it 
clear from the start that we would use all of our enforcement powers, including court action if necessary, but are 
pleased to have reached agreement with the airlines before court proceedings were required," Clive Maxwell, the 
OFT's chief executive, said in a press release. Good on the airlines and the OFT for coming to a deal, and saving 
the taxpayers the cost of a court battle.

Apply: British Airways Visa with 100,000 Bonus Avios
Today and tomorrow are the last days to get the British Airways Visa. Since some of you have been asking for a 
very clear, prioritized list of pros and cons to the card, here's our top 10 list of why to get the card, and also the key 
reasons why you may not want to get it. 
Top 10 Reasons to Get the British Airways Visa
1. Largest Current Credit Card Bonus: up to 100,000 Avios Points 
50,000 Avios after first purchase
Additional 25,000 Avios (75,000 total Avios) after spending $10K on the card
Additional 25,000 Avios (100,000 total Avios) after spending another $10K ($20K total) on the card
There's been a downward trend for credit card bonus offers, with the Sapphire Preferred bonus reduced to 40,000 
from 50,000 and the Freedom reduced from 20,000 to 10,000, so this is a great opportunity to pick up at least 
50,000 bonus miles, and up to 100,000 if you can spend $20,000 on it within a year.
2. 50,000 Avios for 2 Roundtrip Coach Awards to Europe from Boston
As we wrote Maximizing British Airways Avios-Fly Aer Lingus to Europe and Avoid Fuel Surcharges even if you 
don't want to fly British Airways to Europe due to steep fuel surcharges of $500 or more per ticket, the upside of the 
distance-based award chart is that you can book a coach award on Aer Lingus from Boston to Dublin or Shannon 
for just 12,500 Avios one-way, or 25,000 roundtrip. That means that after buying a cup of coffee with your new 
British Airways Visa, you can get 50,000 Avios points and redeem them for two roundtrip coach tickets Boston to 
Dublin, then get to London or anywhere in Europe cheaply on Ryanair and other low cost carriers. Taxes and fees 
are about $146 per Aer Lingus ticket, so under $300 for the two tickets.
3. Cheap awards on LAN to South America
Top 10 Reasons to Get the British Airways Visa (and 3 Reasons Not To)
You can fly business class on LAN from Miami to Punta Cana for just 15,000 Avios (30,000 roundtrip) or Miami to 
Guayquil business class for 20,000 Avios (40,000 roundtrip) for a Galapagos adventure. 
4. Cheaper Awards on AA Short Haul Direct Flights Than Using AAdvantage Miles
Crazy but true: it will cost you fewer Avios points than AAdvantage miles to book an American Airlines coach award 
between California and Hawaii. Same with other short haul direct flights, such as NYC to Montreal for just 4500 
Avios one-way, or 9000 roundtrip.
5. Cheap Intra-Asia, Intra-Europe and Intra-Australia Short Haul Awards 
Avios are not only handy for short haul flights within the U.S.: they're great for short hops among cities in Europe 
(British Airways, Air Berlin), intra-Asia (Cathay Pacific, 
6. Companion Ticket for British Airways First Class or Business Class
If you can manage to put $30K on the card in a calendar year, you can get a free companion ticket valid with an 
award ticket. This is not your typical award ticket that requires you to buy an expensive full fare ticket in order to 
qualify for the companion ticket. Instead, you could use 120,000 Avios points of the over 130,000 points you would 
earn by spending $30K on the card to fly yourself and your partner or friend first class between the East Coast and 
Europe. Yes, there would be fuel surcharges and taxes on both tickets amounting to about $1000 per ticket, but 
British Airways' new First Class is quite a treat!
See How to Maximize the British Airways Companion Certificate on Award Tickets
7. NYC Michelin Dining Discounts 
Who doesn't enjoy splurging occasionally on a Michelin-star restaurant? Thanks to the British Airways Visa, my 
husband and I have enjoyed $400 off Michelin star dining at top NYC restaurants such as Eleven Madison Park, 
Per Se, Sushi Azabu and Jean-Georges in the past year. British Airways has twice run dining promotions that offer 
$50 off twice at NYC Michelin restaurants, so by splitting the check and each using our card, that's been $100 off 
each time, at four different restaurants. This has more than made up for the $95 annual fee, which is not waived.
See British Airways Visa Offers $100 Off 2 NYC Michelin Restaurants--Again!
8. Chip and Signature
As we wrote in Best EMV Chip Travel Credit Cards in the U.S., the British Airways Visa is one of the few U.S. cards 
that offer an embedded chip, which is incredibly helpful at automated machines and in more remote areas in 
Europe that only accept chip cards. I encountered this several times in our trip to Mercantour National Park, France 
and along the toll roads along the French Riviera.
9. Diversify Your Points
Don't put all your eggs in one basket, whether in terms of financial investments or frequent flyer miles and loyalty 
points. Any given program can and ultimately will suffer a devaluation. And since British Airways miles already 
underwent a devaluation in conjunction with their change to Avios points, it's more likely that another program's 
miles/points will get devalued first.
10. 2.5 Avios for each $1 of British Airways Spend
While getting 2.5 Avios points for each $1 of British Airways spend is the least important reason, since most U.S. 
travellers don't have a ton of British Airways spend, it is more generous than the 2 miles you typically get from other 
airline credit cards.
3 Reasons NOT to Get the British Airways Visa
Top 10 Reasons to Get the British Airways Visa (and 3 Reasons Not To)
Ok, so as always, there are cons. Here are the main ones we see:
1. Not for long-haul International Awards
While we'll be flying soon first class on Cathay Pacific to Bali using pre-devaluation British Airways miles, this is 
now a much more expensive award. Use American AAdvantage miles for this kind of trip, not British Airways Avios
2. Not for Travel on British Airways, Unless Using a Companion Ticket
Due to high fuel surcharges and London Heathrow departure taxes, we do NOT recommend using Avios points for 
travel on British Airways EXCEPT for First or Business Class using the Companion Ticket
3. Not for Everyday Spend, Except When Meeting Minimum Spend for the Bonus
This is not an everyday spend kind of credit card, the way the Freedom and Sapphire Preferred are, since its only 
bonus category is for spend on British Airways. This can also be said, however, of virtually all other airline credit 
cards.

[ Image removed: Spain, Barajas ]
The government of Spain has announced that it is raising airport taxes.
The amount of the increase depends on the airport, with the average being 18.9 percent. Taxes at the two busiest 
airports, however, will more than double. Madrid's Barajas airport will increase from 6.95 euros to 14.44 ($8.64 to 
$17.94). Barcelona's El Prat airport will go from 6.12 euros to 13.44 ($7.60 to $16.70).
Ryanair and Vueling have already passed the extra fee onto their passengers. Other airlines have yet to decide 
how to respond. The tax is retrospective for those who booked before July 2, 2012, and are traveling from July 1 
onwards.
Spain is one of the most troubled economies of the Eurozone. It has recently been granted up to 100 billion euros 
($124 billion) in bailouts for its banks and the government is planning harsh austerity measures in order to balance 
the books. With summer tourist season kicking into high gear, the increased tax will bring in tens of millions in 
much-needed funds, assuming it doesn't turn away too many tourists.

I m lucky enough to have lived through the  Jet Set  era, and to have been travelling regularly in those days to and 
from the far east - often enjoying business, and sometimes, first class.
Back then, travelling anywhere by air was special. You were treated fabulously, from the moment you checked in, 
until the point at which the crew saw you off the aircraft. The food was reasonable (often excellent in business or 
first) drinks were free and plentiful, and you would receive little extras like pillows, blankets, eye shades and even 
slippers to wear during the flight, whilst you languished with tons of leg room and a personal television.
When I first moved to Lanzarote, I continued to pay extra to enjoy some of this  special  feeling, by choosing always 
to use British Airways for my trips. The food wasn t great, but it was free, as were the drinks. The luggage 
allowance was generous, there was plenty of leg room, and the pilots retained that wonderful clipped vowel voice to 
the extent that you half expected them to shout  Tally ho, ginger!  at any moment. 
And then BA stopped flying the route.
So, like many people, I switched to budget airlines like Easyjet and Ryanair. I put up with their rigorous rules about 
hand luggage, the lack of space for my legs and the lack of any ceremony and pleasure as part of the deal. 
I did so because they offer astonishing value for money. I sometimes wondered how they could fly my portly frame 
and a suitcase for 2000 miles for the price of a half decent meal, but I was a convert, and relished spending the 
money I d saved once I was at whatever destination I had chosen.
Until last Saturday, when it all went horribly wrong.
It s a long story, but one worth recounting in detail to underpin my decision to never fly budget again.
I was booked on a 6.25 AM flight with Easyjet from Gatwick, returning home to Lanzarote after a business trip- I 
arrived at the airport at 4.25AM because I wanted to get through security, have some breakfast and buy some stuff I 
needed on the air side shops   including a pen refill I can t get at home. I was already checked in on the flight, I 
simply needed to drop my bag with them.
My Time And Sanity Are Worth More Than I can Save With Easyjet
One of Easyjet s money saving methods is to use a communal check-in. They don t have a separate queue for 
each flight. I was horrified to see that the check-in (for bag drop only) was simply huge, and I joined the queue at a 
few minutes before 4.30AM.
In normal circumstances, it should have taken me about an hour to get through, still leaving me enough time to get 
some food. But, every ten minutes or so, an Easyjet rep would call out  Anybody for the Kefalonia flight, please 
come forward, check in is closing.  This happened 5 or 6 times, and people who had arrived after me were hauled 
past me to check in and go through. 
Can you imagine how that felt after three hours sleep and no food? My middle aged temperament was really 
struggling to stay under control! It gradually dawned on me that many people were effectively gaming the system. 
Turn up ten minutes before the check in closes, wait at the back of the queue, and then simply come forward when 
your flight is shouted. 
At 6AM, I finally hit the front myself and I loaded my case onto the scales. The young lady on the desk looked at my 
printed boarding card and said to me:  You re very late, you ll need to run once you get through security if you want 
any chance of making your flight, please get to the airport on time in future.  Showing incredible composure, and not 
wanting to be offloaded, I replied:  I have been here since 4.30AM, the problem is the system, not my arrival time.  
She told me  You should have come to the front of the queue, even if nobody called you. Next time, just do it, or you 
might not get on your flight.  I just looked at her and took my passport back.
Fortunately, I got through security without any mishaps, and I did indeed run for the gate, arriving in a sweaty mess, 
the last but one person to board the aircraft, and without having time to organise my music or book for the flight. I 
ended up paying a fortune on board for a very poor attempt at a bacon roll and a very  instant  cup of coffee. Once 
airborne, and without music or book, I had time to reflect:
The flight was still great value for money. 
But what value would I put on my time and state of mind? 
Standing in a queue for an hour and a half is something I m happy to pay for to avoid. 
Being spoken to by a young lady as though I was at fault for not arriving three hours before my flight, or for not 
jumping a queue is something I m happy to pay for to avoid. 
Running through an airport, when I m tired and hungry, is something I m happy to pay for to avoid.
So I ve come full circle. It has suddenly dawned on me that the compromises required to keep the price so low just 
aren t worth it to me.
I d actually rather pay more, and receive something approaching good service.
That won t be the case for everyone reading this. But for me, it s the right solution. 
Sadly BA don t fly this route anymore, but I ll cast around amongst the scheduled services, and hopefully I ll find 
one that offers the right value / service compromise to suit my needs.

IT IS one of the most infuriating things about booking a flight on a budget airline: clicking through to the online

charge ; Gulliver calls it a sneaky exercise in money-grabbing. Ryanair, for example, charges a £6 ($9) fee. That is 
for each person, for each leg of a trip. For a family of four booking a return, that means a £48 charge just for using a 
card, even if you pay for the whole thing in one go. 
Ryanair and its ilk can clearly charge what they like for a flight. But it is sly to lay it on customers at the very last 
moment, once they have reached the checkout and are about to pay (bear in mind, this is not a straightforward 
process: to get to the payment page they will already have ploughed through many screens of offers on hire cars, 
suitcases, priority boarding and the like). It is not as if the charge is optional. Has anyone ever turned up at Ryanair 
headquarters and tried to pay with cash? It was once the case that the airline's customers could swerve the charge 
if they paid with an Electron debit card. It is not clear to me why it cost Ryanair £48 less to process a family s flight 
with this obscure piece of plastic than with the more popular cards that everyone has in their wallets. In any case, 
something must have changed, because as soon as many regular fliers cottoned on and applied for Electrons to 
use solely for booking flights, it began charging for its use too. Nowadays, the only way to avoid it is to pay with a 
pre-paid Ryanair  passport card . 
So it is good, if thoroughly overdue, news that budget airlines have today been told to include these administration 
fees in their upfront prices, following enforcement action by Britain s Office of Fair Trading. Ryanair will begin its 
new era of transparency on August 1st when it will include administration fees on its adverts. It will include it in the 
prices it offers on its website from December 1st. Eleven other budget carriers will also be affected: Aer Lingus, BMI 
Baby, Eastern Airways, easyJet, Flybe, German Wings, Jet2, Lufthansa, Thomas Cook, Thomson and Wizz Air.
It is not all positive, though. Anyone booking with a credit card rather than a debit card will probably still be 
surcharged.

Ryanair operates a low-fares scheduled passenger airline serving short-haul, point-to-point routes between Ireland, 
the UK, Continental Europe, and Morocco. The company offers more than 1,300 scheduled short-haul flights per 
day serving 155 locations. This case study looks at how Ryanair has risen to become the world's most popular 
airline for international travel.
Features and benefits
* MarketLine Case Studies describe topics such as innovative products, business models, and significant company 
acquisitions.
* Fact-based and presented in an accessible style, they explain the rationale of commercial decisions and illustrate 
wider market and economic trends.
Highlights
Ryanair has redefined the airline industry with its low-cost operating model. In order to keep costs to a minimum the 
airline uses small, regional airports and operates as a point-to-point carrier, thus avoiding the costs associated with 
a hub-and-spoke service.
The company's adoption of a low-cost operating model allows it to pursue a price-led offering. Ryanair advertises 
itself as "The low fares airline" and has a price promise under which it will pay double the difference if a customer 
finds the same flight cheaper elsewhere. The tradeoff for the low fares is a so-called "no-frills" service.
Although the company receives a great deal of negative publicity, this is not entirely warranted and Ryanair in fact 
tops several rankings that measure customer satisfaction. These include rankings for punctuality, environmental 
friendliness, lost bags, and the number of complaints received.
Your key questions answered

 Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton has won a role to advise Ryanair on competition aspects of its latest bid for Irish 
aviation rival Aer Lingus.
Ryanair, which already owns 30% of Aer Lingus, has made a new offer which values the airline at  694m (£560m). 
Arthur Cox chairman Eugene McCague is advising Aer Lingus on the corporate aspects of the bid, alongside Dublin 
corporate partner Stephen Hegarty, while it is understood that regular adviser A&L Goodbody is representing 
Ryanair on corporate law. 
Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton has won a role to advise Ryanair on competition aspects of its latest bid for Irish 
aviation rival Aer Lingus.
Ryanair, which already owns 30% of Aer Lingus, has made a new offer which values the airline at  694m (£560m). 
Arthur Cox chairman Eugene McCague is advising Aer Lingus on the corporate aspects of the bid, alongside Dublin 
corporate partner Stephen Hegarty, while it is understood that regular adviser A&L Goodbody is representing 
Ryanair on corporate law.
The bid comes just days after the long-contested competition issue surrounding Ryanair s existing stake in Aer 
Lingus was referred by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to the Competition Commission.
UK and European authorities have been investigating the stake since the deal completed in 2006 amid concerns 
that it could hamper competition for passenger air travel between the UK and Ireland, claims which Ryanair 
disputes.
Cleary's team is being led by City and Brussels-based partner Nicholas Levy, while Covington & Burling is advising 
Ryanair on the competition dispute over the existing stake, led by Brussels antitrust partner Georg Berrisch.
Meanwhile, Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft competition partner Alec Burnside is continuing to represent Aer Lingus 
on the competition aspects of the existing stake, flanked by Linklaters  Eamonn Doran.
Cleary checks in for competition role on new Ryanair Aer Lingus bid
The OFT commenced an investigation into Ryanair s stake in Aer Lingus in October 2010 but the process has been 
delayed several times, most recently due to a legal challenge by Ryanair which was dismissed by the Court of 
Appeal in May.

MINYANVILLE ORIGINAL TeleNav (TNAV) tumbled 3.30% to a fresh low after the navigation-software maker was 
reduced by Robert W. Baird's marvelously-named analyst Will Power. Meanwhile Chesapeake Energy (CHK), 
whose CEO prefers $12 million maps of the antique variety, continues to lose its way, with a downgrade this 
morning following yesterday's decline. Tom-Tom (TMOAF), whose GPS devices get you to your destination much 
more effectively - except in beleaguered Europe, where they send you to the wrong country, of course - gained 
13.48% on an upbeat reaction to its deal with Apple Inc. (AAPL). And pride-of-Dublin Ryanair (RYAAY), which 
transports hooky-playing compatriots much to the chagrin of Angela Merkel, fell 1.63% on bearish research 
comments.
Today in economics, analysts expect an essentially unchanged figure for April business inventories at 10:00 a.m. 
Eastern. In earnings action, Culp Inc. (CFI), Korn/Ferry International (KFY), and Luby's (LUB) are all due to report 
results.
McDonald's (MCD): The Dow member gets downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Goldman.
Chesapeake Energy (CHK): As mentioned, shares are moved to Market Perform from Outperform by Sanford 
Bernstein.

By Martin T., Macronomics
 He who rejects restructuring is the architect of default.    Macronomics.
Following on the theme of deflationary indicators (see our conversations  Shipping is a leading credit indicator     
Shipping is a leading deflationary indicator ), we thought this time around we would venture towards Air Cargo and 
Airlines, given that on June 5 the Lex Column in the Financial Times asked an interesting question in relation to 
Europe and Airlines:
 How many airlines does Europe need? Certainly not 40, providing 8.5 per cent more seat capacity in 2011 
compared with 2007. One theory says that the region could live with three flag carriers (Lufthansa, International 
Airlines Group and Air France-KLM), a couple of budget airlines (Ryanair and easyJet) and perhaps, a few niche 
players. But while consolidation talk is plentiful, the actual pace of airline rationalisation remains fairly stately. 
As we posited in our  Shipping  conversations, as far as Airlines are concerned, in similar fashion, it is as well 
aglobal game of survival of the fittest.
In fact Lex Column concluded their 5th of June EU consolidation conversation by the following:
 Ultimately, though, credit withdrawal pressures may be required to achieve rationalisation. Last year, these pushed 
Malev and Spanair out of the skies. It could be an even tougher winter ahead. 
We already know from our various credit conversations relating to 2011 issues, namely access to dollar funding, 
that many European banks have in fact scaled back from dollar-funded businesses such as aircraft financing. In 
similar fashion to shipping we believe credit withdrawal will accelerate the pace of rationalisation in the European 
skies.
As a reminder:
AIR TRAFFIC   A LEADING DEFLATIONARY INDICATOR
Last year issues surrounding liquidity issues and difficulties in accessing dollar funding mean most European banks 
are paring back on their Structured Finance Operations: Definition of Structured Finance business - source Credit 
Agricole CIB:
 The Structured Finance business consists in originating, structuring, and financing operations involving large-scale 
exports and investments in France and abroad, often backed by collateral security (e.g. aircraft, ships, corporate 
real estate, or commodities), as well as complex and structured loans.
The Structured Finance division comprises nine finance segments: aviation and rail / shipping finance / tax-based 
leases / natural resources, infrastructure and power / real estate and lodging / export and trade finance / acquisition 
finance / transactional commodity finance / structured finance advisory. 
So in our Air Traffic conversation we will first look at Air Cargo as a leading deflationary indicator then at the 
ongoing issues plaguing Airlines which will lead to consolidation.
According to a note by Nomura published on the 12th of June, Air Cargo is a leading indicator of chemical volume 
growth and economic activity:
 Our air cargo indicator of industrial activity came in at -7.6% (y-o-y) in May, following -7.8% in April and -4.3% in 
March. As a readily available barometer of global industrial activity, air cargo volume growth is a useful indicator for 
chemical volume growth. 
It has also been a very reliable indicator in relation to industrial production according to Nomura:
 Over the past nine years  monthly data, there has been an 85% correlation between air cargo volume growth and 
global industrial production (IP) growth, with an air cargo lead of one to two months. In turn, this has translated into 
a clear relationship between air cargo growth and chemical industry volume growth. 
Nomura s proprietary air cargo indicator shows a high correlation (85%) with global industrial production:
Moving on to the ongoing issues plaguing the Airlines industry, as recently as yesterday IATA (the International Air 
Transport Association) has almost doubled its 2012 loss forecast for European airlines and said the continent s debt 
crisis could wipe out an expected global profit according to Bloomberg - IATA Doubles Loss Forecast for Europe 
Airlines on Crisis:
 Carriers in Europe may lose $1.1 billion this year, compared with a March forecast for a $600 million loss, the 
airline body said today at its annual meeting in Beijing. It reiterated a forecast for a $3 billion global profit. The 
worldwide estimate could be reduced if the European economy worsens more than expected, the group said.  If 
there s a full-blown crisis, all bets are off,  Tony Tyler, head of IATA, which represents about 240 carriers, said in a 
Bloomberg TV interview yesterday.  It will have a big impact on the world economy and a huge impact on airlines.  
Global profits are already set to fall from $7.9 billion last year, as recessions in the U.K., Spain and other European 
countries damp demand and erode gains from lower fuel prices. Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA), Air France-KLM 
(AF) Group and International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG), Europe s three biggest full- service carriers, 
have all announced plans to cut staff or restructure operations following first-quarter losses. 
Although the recent fall in fuel costs could been seen as good news for Airlines, in the 1st quarter of 2012, soft 
pricing and high fuel costs had already meant losses for European airlines due to weak price elasticity for European 
carriers as indicated by Bloomberg on the 26th of April:
 Most European airlines will record losses in 1Q, according to consensus expectations. Load factors improved on 
depressed air fares, which rose 6% on average during the period, barely enough to cover the 400 bps to 500 bps of 
margin loss due to higher fuel costs. Substantial hedging should alleviate some, not all, of the pain.  - source 
Bloomberg
AIR TRAFFIC   A LEADING DEFLATIONARY INDICATOR
In fact given that many carriers hedge more than 70% of fuel consumption, it is highly unlikely that the recent fall in 
fuel prices will make a big difference to their difficult situation:
 European airline fuel hedges could alleviate the effects of a 1Q fuel price increase. Jet fuel prices rose 16% yoy 
and 9% sequentially. The effect of high fuel prices could be damped as many carriers hedged more than 70% of 
fuel consumption for the period. Hedges are typically most effective when prices rise significantly sequentially.  - 
source Bloomberg, 26th of April.
So as we posited in our conversation    Growth divergence between US and Europe? It s the credit conditions 
stupid  , same apply to US Airlines versus European Airlines, its the credit conditions stupid given, as indicated by 
Bloomberg in their article - IATA Doubles Loss Forecast for Europe Airlines on Crisis:
 IATA raised its profit forecast for North American carriers to $1.4 billion from $900 million. The airlines will boost 
earnings from $1.3 billion last year as they refrain from adding many flights amid a 0.5 percent growth in demand, 
the slowest pace worldwide, the group said. 
As far as traffic is concerned, in similar fashion to shipping (see our previous posts), traffic to the Americas have 
been the biggest beneficiary as indicated by Bloomberg in April:
 Lower airfares boosted international demand and improved load factors for European carriers in 1Q. Traffic to the 
Americas saw the best improvement, probably aided by depressed U.S.-to-Europe air fares. Asia-Pacific region 
traffic, the second-biggest market, also improved during the period on lower fares.  - source Bloomberg, 26th of 
April.
As far as Europe consolidation is concerned, the game of survival of the fittest is truly on. For instance, Air France-
KLM in the first quarter of 2012 took market shares to its rival IAG (the British Airways and Iberia company formed 
in January 2011) as reported by Bloomberg on the 26th of April:
 Domestic load factors improved in 1Q for the top full-service European airlines, though they remained weak at 
about 67 on average, on a 3.6% traffic gain and with capacity unchanged. Air France added capacity and increased 
traffic, improving load factors and gaining market share from IAG, which cut capacity during the quarter.  - source 
Bloomberg.
Europe has already seen some airlines collapse this year, including Hungary s Malev and Spain s Spanair as a 
matter of fact.
When it comes to low cost airlines, the fight is as well truly on, in a weak pricing environment where Ryanair s loss 
in the 1st quarter was, as reported by Bloomberg, EasyJet s treasure:
  Ryanair s 2.3% capacity cuts weighed on low-cost European airlines  domestic capacity growth (3.4%) in 1Q amid 
weakness in pricing. EasyJet countered Ryanair s contraction by adding 7% capacity during the period, increasing 
market share. Domestic load factors were unchanged for European low-cost carriers on a 1% increase in traffic.  - 
source Bloomberg 26th of April.
Although US Airlines have been benefiting from European woes, according to Bloomberg, American, United Airlines 
are most exposed to a potential fall in Latin America Airfaires:
 Non-premium airfares for U.S. to Latin America travel fell for the second straight month in May, by 3%, while 
premium fares fell sharply by 28%, indicating Latin America passenger yields may slow. American Airlines and 
United are the most exposed to demand changes to the region because they are the biggest carriers to Latin 
America by traffic.  - source Bloomberg, 17th of May.
But in this global deflationary environment, it is not only affecting American and European carriers facing potential 
headwinds such as pricing issues, weak earnings and consolidation threats. Australian airline Qantas predicted a 
91% drop on the 5th of June 2012 leading to an 18% slump in its share price on the day:
AIR TRAFFIC   A LEADING DEFLATIONARY INDICATOR
 Qantas Airways Ltd., Australia s largest carrier, plunged to a record low in Sydney trading after
saying annual profit may fall as much as 91 percent because of losses on overseas routes and higher fuel costs.
The carrier, which listed in 1995, slumped as much as 18 percent, the biggest drop since February 2009, to as low 
as A$1.16 at 1:52 p.m. in Sydney as the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index
rose 1 percent. Credit-default swaps rose to an eight-month high.
Underlying profit before tax may be A$50 million ($49 million) to A$100 million in the year ending June because of a 
A$700 million increase in fuel bills and a doubling of losses at Qantas International, the airline said today. The 
Sydney-based carrier could also lose its investment-grade credit rating at Standard & Poor s following the profit 
warning, said National Australia Bank Ltd.  - source Bloomberg
On the 5th of June Qantas 5 year CDS jumped 15 bps to 365, their highest since October 2011,
according to CMA data. S and P downgrading the carrier from BBB is likely and a two-grade two-grade cut to a non-
investment level is an  outside possibility,  according to National Australia Bank said in a research note as reported 
by Bloomberg.
In similar fashion to Wilbur Ross planning shipping expansion as industry distress grows for shipping (which we 
discuss in our recent shipping conversation), the sharks are circling the stricken airline industry as well, with 
Qantas shares jumping 11% today, their biggest gain in more than 5 years as reported by Bloomberg. This jump 
has led Qantas to hire Australian bank Macquarie Group Ltd to ward-off the predators    Qantas Hires Macquarie for 
Takeover Defense After Slump :
 Qantas may be more attractive to bidders after its stock slumped to its lowest levels on record last week after 
forecasting the first annual net loss since a 1995 initial public offering. The airline, which can only legally be 
controlled by Australian investors, is battling rising losses on international services as rivals from the Middle East 
and Asia lure passengers. 
Similar to the shipping industry, consolidation, defaults and restructuring are going to happen no matter what, in the 
Airline industry in our on-going deflationary game of survival of the fittest.
 The first thing you have to do is accept that decay sets in and there s nothing you can do about it.

Filed under: Europe, Greece
[ Image removed: kos town harbor ]There are more than 200 inhabited Greek islands and travelers can feel a bit 
overwhelmed trying to decide which ones they should visit. Most Americans stick to Santorini, Mykonos or Crete but 
there are scores of other viable alternatives that are just as alluring as these famous locales.
Over the next several weeks, I'll be reporting on some Greek islands you might want to consider for your next 
holiday. Our first stop is Kos, a bucolic island of about 30,000 year-round inhabitants that was the home of 
Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine. Here are several reasons why Kos is well worth a visit.
Direct Flights. Unlike many Greek islands, you can fly directly into Kos on Ryanair from a dozen European cities 
including London, Rome and Brussels, and a number of other discount airlines, including German Wings, Air Berlin, 
and Easy Jet. We flew from Bari, Italy for about $100 each, one way. Kos is also a convenient ferry hub where you 
can continue on to Patmos, Kalymnos, Rhodes, Pireaus (Athens) and a number of other ports.

Ryanair fears an end to its run of success; Lufthansa saves, invests and modernizes; Air Berlin wants to introduce 
discount fares. Europe's airlines are fighting for market share in an industry in flux.
 Europe's biggest discount airline, Ryanair, was always good for new savings ideas - most of which normally came 
from the boss himself, Michael O'Leary. By reducing the amount of ice in drinks, for example, the airline shed 
thousands of kilos and saved thousands of euros in the process. Ryanair even considered using just one pilot per 
flight - although, apparently, nothing ever came of that.
 Not all companies are considering such measures, though, despite Europe's ongoing economic woes and the high 
fuel costs that are increasing pressure on European airlines. As aviation expert Heinrich Großbongardt said, the 
airlines are continuing to groan under oil prices, which are expected to rise even further throughout the year.
 "And then you've got the 'little things,' like aviation taxes and emission credits, on top of that," Großbongardt said in 
an interview with DW. And European airlines are also dealing with tougher competition as a result of the expansion 
of state aviation companies from the Persian Gulf region.
 Air Berlin in transition
 The ongoing recession and the shrinking price gap between discounters and regular carriers are a few reasons for 
Ryanair's pessimism, which comes at the end of a long run of success and despite record profits recorded last year.
 But the Irish carrier isn't the only discount airliner in transition.
 Air Berlin - Germany's second-largest airline - has also been battling weak numbers. Aside from an internal 
austerity package announced earlier this year, it also has plans to introduce discount fares.
 Its new "JustFly" price includes online-only check-in and extra fees for checked baggage - as its competitor 
Germanwings, a Lufthansa subsidiary, has been doing for some time.
 Großbongardt emphasizes that Air Berlin finds itself in a difficult transition period: it has to save while implementing 
a new business model.
Europe's airlines gear up for turbulent times
 Whereas in the past the company largely carried business passengers on flights within Europe, it's now intending 
to extend this to longer routes, including through a partnership with Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways.
 Lufthansa in holding pattern
 Lufthansa, recognized worldwide by its emblematic crane logo, is also facing tough times. It will likely have to lay 
off personnel, and merge operations and subsidiaries.
 With its new "Score" program, Germany's flag carrier hopes to earn an additional 1.5 billion euros by the end of 
2014. Last year, even though the airline broke the 100-million-passenger mark for the first time, this wasn't enough 
to boost its bottom line.
 Due to a lack of demand, Lufthansa intends to strike business class from certain routes. And as an offensive 
maneuver it will also build up its business class offerings on stretches with high demand - with new seats that can 
turn into beds.
 As such, Lufthansa is positioning itself to maintain its leadership in the premium sector.
 Up in the air
 At Lufthansa's main competitor, Air France, rumors of downsizing up to 5,000 jobs are causing concern. Within the 
last year, French-Dutch parent company Air France-KLM suffered 800 million euros in losses. A 2-billion-euro cost-
cutting program is intended to help out by the end of 2014.
 Within the industry Großbongardt thinks other consolidations are to be expected. Never before have there been so 
many players on the European aviation field, he said, adding that he doubts they all can be successful.

Filed under: Europe, Airlines, Budget Travel
[ Image removed: ryanair photo ]Ryanair, Easy Jet, German Wings and other discount airlines have changed how 
Europeans travel, but until last week, I'd yet to fly on a budget European airline and had no idea what to expect. 
After booking a ticket from Bari, Italy, to Kos in Greece several weeks ago on Ryanair, my expectations were very 
modest based upon a very annoying booking process and a series of warning emails I received about baggage and 
boarding procedures.
But my interactions with live Ryanair staff were pleasant and the flight itself was smooth sailing. Here are some 
observations and tips for flying on Ryanair.
Don't use Google Chrome. After clicking through what seemed like a thousand pages offering me everything from 
rental cars to luggage, I clicked "purchase" but then my browser just spun fruitlessly for hours without confirming my 
purchase. It was unclear to me if the purchase went through, so I had to call Ryanair, which, like everything else 
associate with this airline, isn't free. I was told that their site doesn't support Google Chrome and that I should try 
again with Internet Explorer. I did so and the purchase went through without a hitch.

Why Go
Come to Paris for its gypsy jazz, dusty little bookstores and the beautiful Sacre-Coeur Basilica, more magnificently 
curved and lascivious than any church should dare. Listen to buskers play while the sun falls over the Eiffel tower, 
and dream amongst the lilac rooftops of Montmatre, where artists such as Dali and Picasso used to live in a whirl of 
abysnthe and cabarets. Still in full swing, come for pavement cafes such as Cafe de Flore, where thinkers continue 
to debate over a cafe noir, and for the hopeless romance of the city's endless boulevards so impressive you can 
somehow walk miles more than you ever have before. Come for the boulangeries and patisseries with elegant 
calligraphy on their signs, and irresistable freshly baked buttery croissants, pain au chocolat and macarons. Come 
for formal gardens so beautiful it's little wonder Parisians have a reputation for seeming smug. Who wouldn't, living 
here?
Paris is known for being expensive, but with these Paris budget travel tips you can enjoy 2 nights at a 5-star hotel 
for $75, unique accommodation in an art gallery for under  30, and bars that serve free couscous and moules frites 
meaning you will never have to suffer as Ernest Hemingway did. As a young man, he had to create walking routes 
away from the most tempting bistros and boulangeries in Paris for lack of funds.
Getting to Paris with miles or points
Given that roundtrip coach tickets to Paris can be over $1000 from the U.S., you can save some serious cash by 
using frequent flyer miles or loyalty points instead. A few of our favorite budget options, and links to credit cards that 
enable you to earn the miles:
Business Class on Aer Lingus Boston to Dublin: 50,000 British Airways Avios points + cheap flight to Paris
You can get 50,000 British Airways Avios points after your first use of the British Airways Visa, enough for a 
roundtrip in business class between Boston and Dublin. You can then buy a cheap flight, for example on Ryanair, 
from Dublin to Paris for under $100 roundtrip.
Paris Budget Travel Tips
Coach on Aer Lingus to Dublin: 25,000 British Airways Avios points + cheap flight to Paris
Coach is half the points of business class, so you could get 2 roundtrip coach awards on Aer Lingus Boston-Dublin 
after your first use of the British Airways Visa, and as in the above, buy cheap Ryanair flights Dublin-Paris.
Apply for the British Airways Visa - 100,000 miles
First Class on Lufthansa (Last Minute): 135,000 United Miles
You only live once, so why not use your miles for first class on Lufthansa? Lufthansa s new First Class offers a 
fantastic experience. You ll need to be book this last minute, as Lufthansa no longer releases first class award 
space in advance. See How to Deal with No More Lufthansa Advance First Class Availability. You can earn the 
miles from either 2 credit card applications plus credit card spend, or from 3 credit card applications. Apply for the 
Ink Bold plus either the United MileagePlus Explorer or the Sapphire Preferred, then either earn the additional 
United miles through spend or by, in about 3 months, applying for the third card (the United MileagePlus Explorer if 
you already applied for the Sapphire Preferred, or the Sapphire Preferred if you already applied for the MileagePlus 
Explorer).
United MileagePlus Explorer (up to 65,000 miles--see Best Travel Credit Cards to apply)
Apply for the Ink Bold Business Card - 50,000 points (50,000 points transfer 1:1 to United miles)
Apply for the Sapphire Preferred Visa - 40,000 points (40,000 points transfer 1:1 to United miles) 
Paris Budget Tips
Cole Porter may have loved Paris when it sizzles, but July and August are the worst times to visit. Flights and hotels 
are at their most expensive, and most restaurants close for a few weeks as locals ditch the streets for the beach.
With its mild West European climate, it's worth visiting Paris from Fall to Spring, when flights are discounted and 
museum lines are much shorter. It may rain during your stay, but there's something lovely about wandering the 
city's avenues scented with rain and chestnut blossom; and there are worse things than enjoying Croque Madames 
and onion soup in warm little bistros while the wind howls outside.
Try and fly to Charles de Gaulle airport rather than Paris Beauvais. From Beauvais, it takes well over an hour by 
bus to get to Paris, and the shuttle costs  15 each way. From Charles de Gaulle, a single on the RER train costs 
much less at  9.25, and it runs every eight minutes.
If you are coming from London, the Eurostar can cost as little as  80 return, and it takes you from London St 
Pancras to Gare du Nord in just over two hours.
If you are staying in Paris for a few days, save money and time and buy a carnet of ten metro tickets for  12.70. 
Each ticket lasts for two hours with as many transfers as you wish. The metro closes at 12.30am, 1.30am on 
weekends, but taxis are surprisingly inexpensive though the fare starts at  5.50.
If there are two things French people care about, it's good food and good manners. Do yourself a favor and say 
'Bonjour Madame/Monsieur' when you enter a store or restaurant, and 'Merci' as you leave. You'll save yourself the 
sight of a disparaging Parisian shaking their head at you.
Paris is no fairytale, and while most people experience no problems at all, like any metropolis there is some tourist-
targeted crime. Be especially aware of your belongings on the train from Charles de Gaulle airport. On the footsteps 
of the Sacre-Coeur, don't accept a ring from any of the shady men, however much they insist it's a gift. If you 
accept, in a few minutes they'll be back to pushily demand a few euros from you. At Gare du Nord train station and 
around the Louvre, con-artists pretending to be deaf might ask you to sign their petitions. If you stop to say yes, you 
might well find your belongings have been hustled from you.
Paris Budget Travel Tips
Where to Stay on a Budget in Paris
There's no getting round the fact that Paris is an expensive place to sleep. Even a room in a basic hotel costs 
around  100 a night.
But plan ahead, and you could be staying in a 5-star hotel for $75 for 2 nights. Apply for the Hyatt Visa and you ll 
receive a sign up bonus of 2 free nights at any Hyatt property in the world, including the Park Hyatt Vendome. If 
your spouse or travel partner also gets the card, that s 4 nights for a total of $150. See Best Park Hyatt to Stay 2 
Free Nights with the Hyatt Visa
Another possibility for free luxury hotel nights is the new Fairmont Visa. It s not quite as lucrative as the Hyatt Visa, 
as you ll need to spend $1000 within the first 3 months to receive your 2 free nights, but if you plan ahead, it could 
be worth it, so that you can stay 2 free nights (and breakfast for two daily) at the 4-star Le Royal Monceau-Raffles 
Paris. See Fairmont Visa Signature Card Review
If you prefer a more low-key stay and the flexibility to cook for yourself, consider an apartment stay. You could 
check out Apartment Service Worldwide (www.apartmentservice.com) or HomeAway.com for ideas. A pretty one-
bedroom apartment in Montmatre is as cheap as  60 a night, and if you stay for a week or more, you may well get a 
huge discount.
For somewhere unique and achingly hip, why not sleep amongst the abstract art at apartment-cum-gallery Cafe au 
Lit. In the up-and-coming Belleville district, a bed at Cafe au Lit may be very basic, but it's only  30.
For those who enjoy the conviviality of hostels, St Christopher's Inn may be the best in Paris. It's modern and 
sparkling clean with a hip location in the 19th arrondissement.
Where to Eat on a Budget in Paris
Compared to New York, Sydney or London, most restaurant menus in Paris are notably similar - the French love 
their own cuisine, and who can blame them?
Gourmands will love the great value lunch menus in Paris. As long as you are off the tourist route, most bistros are 
great, as a French chef would be far too proud to serve bad food to his own people.
These affordable restaurants are particularly recommended: the renowned Chez Gladines at 30 Rue des Cinq 
Diamants in the 13th arrondissement serves hearty portions of Basque favorites like Sherpherd's Pie for only  8, 
while Les Racines in the Latin Quarter (22 Rue Monsieur le Prince, Odeon) has been voted bistro of the year by 
France's leading food critic Gilles Pudlowski, and serves classic French dishes such as veal stew and red mullet for 
around  12, though come early as this little joint is full every lunchtime.
My favourite bistro has to be Bouillon Chartier, 7 Rue du Faubourg, Montmatre. One of the city's last-standing 
bouillon restaurants, Bouillon Chartier comes from a time when working-class apartments had no kitchens, so 
workers used to come for lunch here, brandishing their own knives and forks. It is not just its charming history, nor 
even the honest food, Le Chartier epitomizes high-ceilinged Belle Epoque glamor, and the fabulous waiters are true 
gentlemen, decked out as they are in starched white shirts and bow ties.
If Bouillon Chartier is full and you are in Montmatre, you could head to La Mere Catherine at the foot of Sacre-
Couer, 6 Place du Tetre. Established in 1793, this was the first place in the city to be coined a bistro, and yes it is a 
little touristy, all checkered tablecloths and live piano music, but it is also fun. No wonder La Mere Catherine was 
where Danton wrote, 'Eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we may die.' 
The districts to head to for crepes are the Latin Quarter, Montmatre and ritzy Montparnasse, which is where the 
Bretons who invented crepes first settled. Make sure to choose a stand where the crepes are made from scratch, 
not only because they are more delicious, but because half the joy is in the anticipation of watching your pancake 
being freshly made.
Paris Budget Travel Tips
There is no shortage of falafel houses in Paris, especially in the Jewish quarter of Marais. The crisp chickpea fritters 
are especially famous at L'As du Fallafel on 34 Rue des Rosiers, favored by no less than Lenny Kravitz and Paris 
foodie David Lebovitz. Note that it closes for Shabbat, meaning from a bit before sundown Friday and all of 
Saturday, as well as for Jewish holidays.
In Paris, a number of bars do free couscous on Friday and Saturday evenings, including Les Fontaines (153 Rue 
Saint-Maur) and Le Grenier (152 Rue Oberkampf), a sweet little dive bar with live jazz in buzzing Oberkampf. On 
Wednesday and Thursday nights at 9pm, Le Tribal Cafe in the 10th arrondissement does moules frites gratis, and 
even a Mojito is only  4 during their happy hour at 8pm (3 Cour des Petites Ecuries). Now, who said Paris was over-
priced?
What to do in Paris
Sandeman's free Paris tour is informative and often entertaining, and a great way to get acquainted with the city's 
main sights on your first day. It leaves at 11am and 1pm from St. Michel's fountain, but do be sure to tip the guide a 
few euros.
Sign up for a free tour with a local Parisian using Paris Greeters and glimpse a side of Paris that tourists rarely get 
to see. The volunteers are keen to show you their side of the city they love, whether it's colorful vintage markets or 
hidden city squares. Do make sure to request a greeter at least two weeks before your trip, it's well worth it. And do 
donate something so that they can continue to provide this great service.
You could pay  14 and wait for hours in different lines to take the elevator to the top of the Eiffel Tower, or you could 
just take the stairs to the second floor for  5 worth of stunning views. For an alternative vista that takes in the Eiffel 
Tower and Sacre-Couer in one magnificent sweep, take the elevator to the top of the superb Pompidou Centre for 
free.
To beat the queues for the Louvre, head to the ticket office within the metro stop Palais-Royal-Musee du Louvre. 
You will save hours of time. Also, the first Sunday of every month is free, though get there early. Otherwise entry 
costs  14. Don't forget that the museum is closed on Tuesdays.
There are wonderful parks across the city. In summer, free movies are shown at Parc de la Villete, and there are 
free puppet shows at Jardin de Luxembourg. You can also enjoy the man-made beaches put up along the river 
Seine during the hottest months.
My favorite thing about Paris is its book stores. With its cherry blossom and Great Gatsby posters, Shakespeare & 
Company is particularly bohemian and lovely, though it's full of Midnight in Paris fans at the weekend, so if you can, 
browse on a weekday. You can even have a go at the old piano upstairs, anyone is invited to play.
For a more glamorous browse, head to Karl Lagerfeld's Librarie 7L on 7 Rue de Lille in the 7th arrondissement. It is 
filled with photography and design books for the hippest of coffee tables, and sometimes you can get a sneaky view 
of his chic studio.
If you are into Parisienne chic, quirky museums such as Fragonard Perfume Museum at 9 rue Scribe are always 
free, and you can learn how perfume is made in the free tour. If you go, consider combining this with a visit to the 
nearby Palais Garnier, Opera de Paris with its magnificent Chagall ceilings. Unguided visits are 9 EUR (6 EUR for 
students) and guided tours in English are available (reservation advised) for 13.50 EUR.
The department store Galeries Lafayette holds a designer fashion show on its 7th floor every Friday at 3pm, which 
teenage girls in your group will especially love. You must reserve at welcome@galerieslafayette.com a few weeks 
in advance, but if you don't hear back, do call +33 1 42 82 36 40 to confirm.
Gothic Notre Dame de Paris is always free, and if you are lucky, on Sunday mornings you can hear beautiful organ 
music and operatic hymns at Sunday mass.
Paris Budget Travel Tips
France is about 9% Muslim, and the Latin Quarter's Paris Mosque, made of pink marble, is startlingly beautiful. 
Relax in the Turkish baths, or enjoy some mint tea and baklava in the serene mosaic courtyard filled with fig trees. 
You could easily spend a whole day here, entrance is free and guided tours are available.

If you hesitate to invest in the stock market because the P/E 10 is still high relative to its historical levels, it probably 
means you already reached your risk tolerance. P/E 10 may come down, but a lower P/E 10 doesn t necessarily 
mean a lower price. A lower P/E 10 may be achieved by a higher P and an even higher E. A lower P/E 10 does no

London is one of the most expensive places in the world, and with thousands descending upon the city this summer 
for the 2012 Olympic Games, prices will only climb higher. If you want to visit during the Olympics but fear a cheap 
trip to London isn't possible, consider the following tips to make your stay in the city a bit more affordable. With 
some flexibility and a little traveler's ingenuity, you'll be able to save a few pounds across the pond.
Photo by sxc.hu/redfloorPlan ahead. Of course this applies to plane tickets and accommodation, but it also means 
looking into things such as transport ahead of time. The official London 2012 website warns that the city will be 
flooded with visitors for the Olympics and advises travelers to think in advance about how they'll get to the various 
Olympic venues. 
London's extensive public transport network can help you stay out of traffic jams and save cab fare. Make this 
option even cheaper by purchasing an Oyster Card. You can buy a weekly or monthly card, but it's probably easiest 
for a short-term visitor to get a pay-as-you go card, which doesn't require a photo ID and can be topped off as 
necessary.
Think outside the center. When booking accommodation for a cheap trip to London, look beyond the heart of the 
city and also think outside of the traditional hotel or B&B. You can find a cheap room away from the hub of activity 
yet still on the public transport network. London is divided into six zones, with the first being the very center and the 
sixth the outskirts. Research where the venues are for your Olympic events, and consider staying a zone or two 
farther out on the same transit line. You may spend more time on the Tube, but you'll save a significant amount of 
money.
When looking for budget London accommodations, consider sites such as Airbnb, Craigslist, VRBO, and even 
CouchSurfing. Entrepreneurial folks with spare rooms will be looking to cash in on the influx of visitors during the 
Olympics, and you can use this to your advantage. Often you can negotiate rates with individuals, and respected 
booking sites have verification standards for hosts and guests alike.
Photo by sxc.hu/superelvisBe creative with flights. Rather than booking a direct JFK-Heathrow flight, consider 
buying separate flights and piecing together a cheaper trip to London. For example, use frequent flyer miles to get 
you to the East Coast, and then price flights to hubs such as Frankfurt and Amsterdam. From there, you can take 
How to Attend the Summer Olympics on a Budget
an EasyJet or RyanAir flight to Luton, Stanstead, or another satellite airport (or ride the train through the Chunnel) 
at a reduced rate. Just remember that those budget airlines charge you for luggage.
Seek savings elsewhere. The flight to the U.K. and the tickets to the Olympics are naturally going to take up the 
largest chunk of your budget, so make up for your spending on those items by scrimping on others. Consult 
TimeOut London for cheap meals and cocktails, discounted theatre tickets, and a list of free things to do in the city. 
Consider spending a couple of dollars on a smartphone app that provides tips for a cheap trip to London. For $1.99, 
for example, you can download Sutro Media's London: Free & Budget app. Sticking to a budget while you're there 
will help you relax a bit about having to spend so much on the flight and those once-in-a-lifetime tickets.

Matthew Engel of the Financial Times writes about its popular "Lunch with" series, which interviews business men 
and women, as well as others, during a meal.
Engel writes, "Obviously if the paper wishes to interview the world's movers and shakers, it has to do so largely on 
their terms. If the serving US secretary of defence says he will share coffee at the Pentagon, it is difficult to argue 
(especially as it was Donald Rumsfeld). And, naturally, cost-control is a corporate objective.
"But there is a purpose in building the series round lunch, and the editor, Lionel Barber, wants to maintain that 
tradition. 'Lunch,' he says, 'should be done with panache but not indulgence.' He defines that as 'excellent food but 
not vintage wine.'
"A kind of nadir was reached when the self-promoting head of Ryanair insisted on using his office as a venue and 
treating our then aerospace correspondent, Pilita Clark, like one of his passengers: ' 'Here,' says Michael O'Leary, 
shoving something the size of a small grapefruit wrapped in red and white cardboard over the table. 'Lunch.' ' Yet it 
made for a revealing encounter. And in 2010 Alec Russell flew out to meet Morgan Tsvangirai, the Zimbabwean 
prime minister. The menu read as follows: 'Coke: US$1; Sprite: US$1; Return flight to Harare: £950.' Interview: 
priceless.
"Sometimes the free lunches can be the most spectacular. Conductor Sir Simon Rattle cooked shoulder of lamb; 
American TV host Jay Leno barbecued steaks in his garage (or hangar - it held his 130-strong collection of classic 
cars). Best of all, the grand dame of American cookery Julia Child, then 85, allowed Victoria Griffith to cook for her - 
'Steak and couscous,' said Child charmingly, 'the perfect combination.'"

It started as an April Fool's joke that Westjet and Ryanair
both found quite amusing, and has now evolved into one of the most
hotly contested airline topics in recent weeks - the child-free flight.
While
Ryanair claimed that 50% of 1000 Europeans surveyed would pay higher ticket
prices to avoid kids in cabins, and WestJet's fictitious Kargo Kids program
pledged to confine children to a special VIP area, the debate has sparked endless sparring between
all types of travelers. It was mostly funny and a bit ridiculous to watch, or
even think about, until it became real, and now it's scary. And, this
frequent-flying momma with a four-year-old who's been an AAdvantage Platinum
cardholder since her first year of life has a few opinions of her own on this
subject.
Effective 1 July, Malaysia Airlines will introduce a
special upper level economy deck on their new Airbus A380 from Kuala Lumpur to
London that is indeed child-free. That's
right, no kids allowed. Families traveling with children under 12 will not be
The Child-Free Flight: Super Idea or Slippery Slope?
permitted to sit in the cabin no matter what they wish to pay. This comes on the heels of their
controversial move just months ago to ban infants from the first class cabin on
most flights.
While the airline says that the downstairs
cabin will be enhanced, with the addition of extra lavatories and a dual
airbridge for what they call "speedier embarkation and disembarkation," they
maintain the move is to enhance the appeal to higher-paying frequent and
business travelers who feel they shouldn't have their comfort compromised by
noisy children. 
Is this right? Is this okay? One has to wonder where you draw the
line. A recent story by Keli Goff on
Huffington Post is still drawing fierce, venomous comments and arguments back
and forth by readers who either strongly agree or vehemently disagree with the
question which ultimately becomes, "Where do you draw the line?" 
Yes, sometimes children scream or
misbehave, whether it be in stores or on flights. They're
not adults, they don't think like we do, and in the case of younger kids, yes,
they do sometimes cry in flight if they're uncomfortable or hurting. That's life; we all did it once when we were
young, and some still do when they grow up.
They have bad days (and flights) or good ones, just like we do and at
the end of the day, if a family is willing to pay fares for particular cabins,
or even for the right to fly in an economy seat, is it really acceptable to ban
them based on a supposition of how an individual may or may not behave?
I've flown countless hours with my young
daughter, who's been to Europe, Africa, Asia, and back multiple times. Was she cranky at times? Yes, but guess 
what,
so was I. And any noise or inconvenience
she may have made in flight was absolutely nothing compared to the gentleman who sat next to us recently with a 
most unfortunate case of uncontrollable
flatulence. Or the lady who was angry at me for having an aisle seat when she
wanted it (and didn't pre-book it), who just decided to keep getting up for the
The Child-Free Flight: Super Idea or Slippery Slope?
entire five-hour trip, causing me to fold up my laptop and move back and forth,
feeling as though she had the right since "I warned you, I need my aisle, I get
up a lot…"
What about people who can't quite hold
their drink, and get loud and rowdy, or "loud talkers" or those who sing
along with the music piping into their headphones, disturbing the readers around
them, or elderly folks who move slowly
and block up the jetway? Should we start putting them in a new section too or
ban them altogether? Seems to me that
the only people who have made the news in recent times for disturbing a flight
have been disgruntled in-flight staff, or highly intoxicated people - all
adults, not children.
We live in a world
that is supposed to promote tolerance, and we're fortunate enough to have the
right to travel the world. Banning
someone based on a prejudged supposition based on age just seems like we're taking a huge step back when 
we've
come so far. Something just doesn't
seem right.

Why Go
On the northern fringe of Europe, the west coast of Scotland boasts hundreds of miles of rugged coastline set 
against a backdrop of highland moors dotted with tiny crofts and sheep. Off the coast, a string of wild islands 
stretches into the Atlantic, with not a kids' club or all-inclusive resort in sight.
It may rarely be sunbathing weather on the west coast of Scotland, but its white sandy beaches provide plenty of 
interest. Rock pools teem with crabs and cockles, while the powder soft sand is strewn with amber seaweed and 
pale seashells. Marram grass dances in the sunlight while children slide down towering sand dunes looking over the 
Atlantic ocean. Tiny birds swoop over rocky black islets in search of food, their gentle calls crashing with the lapping 
waves. With more deserted beaches than the entire Mediterranean, even in the height of summer you can have a 
perfect sandy bay all to yourself.
Unfortunately, this is Scotland and it could just as likely rain all week. Still, that does not deter seasoned surfers, 
bikers, horse riders and kayakers from turning the west coast's bays into their very own adventure playgrounds for 
much of the year.
Insider Tips
Peak season is June to August when the Gulf Stream ensures a mild summer. May and September can also be 
lovely months.
The Scottish comedian Billy Connelly said that there is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing, which is 
the best attitude to have on a holiday in Scotland. British weather is highly unpredictable. For example, I spent a 
week in March on the west coast hand wore flip flops and a summer dress every day. It snowed for the whole of the 
next week.
The west coast is an especially rainy part of the UK. Even if you book a coastal holiday for August, bring an anorak 
and some warm pullovers just in case.
Adventure Travel Guide to the West Coast of Scotland
Midges are similar to mosquitoes. Watch out for huge clouds of them on a still summer evening, and bring plenty 
insect repellant with you.
Getting There
From the U.S., the best deal is 25,000 British Airways Avios (or 50K Avios for Business Class) for an Aer Lingus 
roundtrip coach flight Boston to Dublin + ~$150 in taxes/fees. See Maximizing British Airways Avios-Fly Aer Lingus 
to Europe and Avoid Fuel Surcharges. You can easily earn 50,000 British Airways Avios with just one use of the 
British Airways Visa, even if you don't put any further spend on the card to earn the full 100,000 Avios.
Link: British Airways Visa - 100,000 miles
Then from Dublin, it's about ~35 EUR + checked baggage fees roundtrip to Glasgow Prestwick on Ryanair.
Renting a car is the best option if you want to keep a flexible itinerary. The coastal routes and islands often have 
quiet single track roads, so take your time and go slowly. Use passing places. It is customary to raise a friendly 
hand to drivers who give way to you, and you will score major points with the locals if you use the passing places to 
allow them to overtake.
The shimmering lochs and snow-capped glens on the West Highland Railroad truly make this one of the world's 
most beautiful rail journeys. The train network is excellent, connecting many villages and towns in the highlands. 
Book via Scotrail
From London Euston to Glasgow Central, the train takes just under five hours and it can cost £50 or less if you use 
The Trainline to find the best deal. At Glasgow Central, it is easy to transfer onto the stunning West Highland 
Railway line.
If you are short on time, there are Easyjet flights from major London airports to Glasgow for around £30. 
Ryanair flies to Glasgow Prestwick on the West Coast for similar prices, but beware of all the add-ons included in 
their online basket. If you plan to head further north on the west coast, there are daily flights from London to 
Inverness airport with Easyjet and Flybe. All these flights take around an hour and a half. Skyscanner will find you 
the best flight deals.
You will need to take a ferry if you want to visit one of Scotland's islands. CalMac operates year-round, and there 
are full timetables on their website.
From May to September, Sheerwater provides the more scenic option. If whales or dolphins are spotted from the 
ferry, the captain will stop the boat so passengers can enjoy the scene.
Where to Stay
There are plenty of sleeping options on the west coast. Whether you go for self-catering or a grand country hotel 
such as at Loch Melfort Hotel, it is best to book well in advance if you plan to stay in summer.
Despite Scotland's changeable weather, camping is also a popular sleeping option. There are campsites along the 
coast, but my favorite is Camusdarach (0044 1687 450 221), 6 km along the coastal road from Arisaig to Mallaig.
If glamping is more your thing, spend a few nights in one of the futuristic Ecopod domes near Port Appin. 
What to Eat
Scotland may not have the best culinary reputation, but times are changing. On menus across the west coast, fresh 
shellfish are the dish of the day.
A well-loved local dish is Cullen Skink, a rich soup of smoked haddock, potatoes and cream, which always hits the 
spot after an energetic day on one of the west coast's blustery beaches.
Adventure Travel Guide to the West Coast of Scotland
The Cornerstone Seafood Restaurant in Mallaig serves a particularly creamy Cullen Skink. This cozy restaurant 
overlooking Mallaig's lively harbor also does Moules Mariniere, served perfectly in a classic French broth 
sweetened with chopped up garlic and shallots for under £10. 
A fish supper eaten at a town harbor while the boats come in is one of life's simplest pleasures. The chips should 
be fat, soft and fluffy, the battered haddock should have a bubbly golden crunch around it, and of course, the 
supper should be doused in lots of salt and vinegar. Lovely. The scampi at Troon's famous 'chippie' Wee Hurrie 
comes particularly recommended. You can find the takeaway on Harbour Road, just look for the queue of people 
coming out the door.
Again, it may not be the healthiest way to start the day, but a cooked Scottish breakfast is justifiable if you are to 
spend the day surfing or mountain biking. A Scottish breakfast is the same as your typical English fare, with the 
addition of some golden potato scones and black pudding.
Surfing on Tiree
The windswept Isle of Tiree has the country's best surf conditions, along with some of the highest sunshine records 
in Britain. It's a small island; twelve miles long by three miles wide, but surf evangelists cannot praise Tiree enough.
Beginners can enjoy a holiday on Tiree too. You can rent all your gear and get lessons from Surf School Scotland.
The Gulf Stream can only bring so much warmth though; water temperatures reach about 15°c in summer. Still, the 
less than tropical temperatures are nothing that a good wetsuit and a hot mug of tea afterwards cannot sort out.
In midsummer, daylight hours are some of the longest in the UK, the sun shines on Tiree's white beaches until 
around 9.30pm.
Tiree may be four and a half hours west of the mainland by ferry, but wind surfers, kite surfers, paddle boarders and 
just plain old surfers descend on the island all summer, so book accommodation well in advance. There are only 
two hotels, so most visitors opt for self-catering or stay at the excellent Millhouse backpackers. Wild camping is also 
possible, but ask for crofters' permission first.
If you are short on time, flights leave for Tiree from Glasgow airport, but if Tiree seems too far to go, the reef at 
Thurso to the north of Scotland holds swell of up to 15 feet, and has hosted numerous international surfing 
competitions.
Pony trekking on Skye
The Isle of Skye's fairy glen is an enchanting sight. Conical hills look like a complex mountain range shrunk in a 
spell, and the fairy pools beguile. The water is crystal clear and looks bathtub warm, the color of the Indian ocean, 
but fall for the magic and dive in, and you might be surprised to find the water's temperature closer to Iceland's than 
Indonesia's.
There are around pony trekking and horse riding centres across Scotland, including one in Uig, near the fairy glen. 
Check out the Trekking and Riding Society of Scotland for more info.
Cycle down Ben Nevis
At 4406ft, Ben Nevis is Britain's biggest mountain, and home to a world-class downhill mountain biking course. This 
is a route for expert mountain-bikers only though, in a 3 km scramble for life, surrounded by rocks and loose scree.
The Ben Nevis bike course is open from May to September. It costs £10 to take the gondola up to its top station, 
then take the bike track down.
If you are not bringing your own bike, you can rent good equipment at the base of the gondola from Alpine Bikes; 
they advise booking well in advance.
Adventure Travel Guide to the West Coast of Scotland
There is little better than cycling through Caledonian pine forests in the dappled afternoon light, and there are over 
25 miles of dedicated cycle routes round Ben Nevis.
Be careful when cycling in towns, there are rarely bike paths and drivers are generally unfriendly towards cyclists.
It is free to take your bike on Scottish trains, but do book space for it in advance. If you are taking your bike on a 
bus, you must dismantle and box it first.
For information on bicycle tours and rentals across Scotland, visit CTC UK 
Kayaking Round the Small Isles
On an overnight kayaking and camping trip with Rockhopper Sea Kayaking, explore deep caves and ancient 
remains by the coast. As you round sea cliffs, you might even spot some sea eagles and otters.
Wilderness Scotland and countless others also provide kayaking holidays.

Ryanair doesn't offer seating preferences - yet. Photo credit: David Precious
Air travel remains a generally unpleasant, though necessary business, but small victories are always welcome. Like 
finding the "perfect seat", for example.
And which is the perfect seat on a standard aircraft? 6A, of course.
Scotland-based flight comparison site Skyscanner polled 1,000 air travelers, asking about their seat preferences 
(leaving aside extra legroom seats) - aisle, center, or window, row placement, even superstitions about row 
numbers. The site found that a 45 percent of respondents preferred seats in the first six rows; 60 percent preferred 
a window seat, 40 percent want the aisle, and only 1 percent of the respondents would take the middle seat if it was 
on offer. The survey comes as low-cost airline easyJet announced that it is now allowing passengers to book seat, 
for a fee of course.
So, what's the worst seat on the plane? 31E, according to the survey, a middle seat towards the back of the plane.
Why 6A? "Anecdotally, some passengers seem to opt for the middle section near the wings where they are less 
likely to feel turbulence while others want to be near the front for ease of getting off the plane, less engine noise or 
even to get a better choice of food available," explained Sam Baldwin, Skyscanner's travel editor. "The window 
seems a popular choice for those looking to sleep, especially for long haul flights, while those who take more trips 
to the toilet prefer to aisle so as not to disturb fellow passengers and the aisle is also popular for tall passengers 
looking to stretch their legs. Frequent fliers have also reported that the left hand side of the plane is best as the 
windows are off centre, allowing for wall space to lean on."
Obviously... "So they had to perform a survey to figure out first class is where people most like to sit?" asked blog 
The Interrobang. "These guys are breaking ground!"
Skyscanner is wrong. Anna Nichols, Expat blogger at The Telegraph, declared that Skyscanner have got it wrong: 
The best seats are one of the two first row aisle seats, because it enables the passenger to "deplane" quickly. That 
not everyone agrees that 6A is the best is also probably why a number of sites exist, such as Seat Guru, that 
purport to help you figure out what seat is best for you on any given airline.
What's the 'perfect seat' on an airplane? 6A

You'd assume it'd be tough to find anyone who thinks the recent secret service prostitution scandal is funny. What 
with "secret service buying women" being a rather improbable set-up for a joke and all. But there's at least one 
person who finds it utterly hilarious. And he or she works in advertising for Spirit Airlines. You can see where this is 
going.
The low-cost airline recently posted a series of "jokes" to promote its low-cost flights to, yep, Colombia. The image, 
above, shows a prototypical "secret service guy" (sunglasses, ear-piece, circa 1995 Caesar-style haircut), giving 
the universal "shush" sign. Behind him: the slogan "More Bang for Your Buck, Flights to Cartagena and Other 
Destinations" and a bevy of nearly naked women. Comic gold?
As XX Factor noted, the ad is about as funny as... there really just isn't an appropriate analogy here, is there?:
We sure hope Spirit Airlines find success with this ad. 'Cus there's nothing funnier than a single mother selling her 
body to make money, getting stiffed on her rate, and facing the wrath of her pimp."
Interesting that we still have to point this out, isn't it? Suddenly, those Ryanair ads feel downright tame.

IF YOU can hire a set of golf clubs for as little as (EURO)35 a week, picking them up and dropping them off at the 
airport, why would you bother to schlep your own equipment onto a plane and pay your airline a huge fee for the 
privilege? This is the sensible thinking behind ClubstoHire.com, a company that started business 18 months ago 
and now operates from nine European airports. I recently saw a press release they sent out and was rather struck 
by their modus operandi.
You get the golf clubs from a shop at the airport or from a ground handler who meets you there, and you can even 
hire shoes. Financially, the deal makes sense. With, for example, Ryanair or Air Berlin, you'll pay (EURO)50 each 
way to put your clubs on a plane, and have to worry about your prized irons getting damaged in the hold or lost in 
the system. Hiring also allows you to have a bit of fun trying some different kit from what you hack around with at 
home. So long as the company has a way to deal with those passengers leaving/arriving at the more ungodly 
hours, and the clubs are decent, it sounds like birdies all the way.

Ryanair, the most hated European budget airline, is known for advertising low fares and then hiking up the actual 
cost with fees for luggage, food, and priority boarding. Most Ryanair passengers know what to expect when 
traveling on the airline, but the company recently made some of their most faithful customers angry: musicians.
Many musicians, particularly those based in Ireland (Ryanair's home country), rely on the airline to get them to the 
continent when they're playing gigs or going on tour.
However, new fees for musical instruments have made the cost of flying so expensive that musicians are struggling 
to afford it, and are even forced to turn down gigs.
Ryanair currently charges a fee for instruments placed in the hold, even though these instruments would otherwise 
be subject to the same baggage fee as any other suitcase.
Even when instruments are small enough to be brought on the plane and placed safely in an overhead bin, 
musicians are still subject to additional charges. Although some musicians (cellists, for example) often pay for a 
separate seat for their instrument, Ryanair is mandating that they place their instruments in the hold, meaning the 
cellist has paid both an extra seat cost and an instrument fee.
Musicians are banding together (no pun intended) to punish Ryanair with a boycott.
"It's just penalizing working musicians for doing their job," said Keith Pascoe, an Ireland-based violinist who 
founded the "Musicians against Ryanair" Facebook group. The group reached 15,000 members at its peak before 
being converted into a page by Facebook.
"Now with the London Olympics refusing to pay musicians for their participation and Ryanair targeting us, we really 
do feel the underdog," Pascoe said. "I fly twenty times a year from Cork and used to use RA so go figure the 
amount they are losing on 15,000 Facebookers who are boycotting them."

The European budget airline Ryanair is on a mission to cut fuel costs. In addition to announcing that it will now print 
its in flight magazine, which will also double as a menu, on thinner paper, Ryanair is also cutting the amount of ice 
on board and will reduce the weight of the seats and carts. These changes will save them thousands of pounds in 
fuel and printing costs, but that's not all they are doing to lighten their load.

Flight attendants for Ryanair may find their jobs in jeopardy if they don't keep their weight in check. Airline 
spokesman Stephen McNamara told The Telegraph: "We encourage staff to watch their weight - with the motivation 
of appearing in the annual Ryanair calendar."
Sounds crazy, but some airlines do more than encourage. Thai Airways required specific BMI and waist line 
measurements of their flight attendants last March, and gave employees six months to drop the weight. In August 
2010, the same happened to 28 Turkish Airline flight attendants who were given six months to lose weight or be 
faced with termination.
I may be in the minority here, and it isn't lost on me that part of these airlines' motivation is to be known for having 
hot flight attendants, which, to be honest, is part of the "fantasy" of the flight attendant (Pan Am, anyone?) but this 
really doesn't bother me much. I can't think of another job where each extra pound you carry actually costs the 
company money. As long as their weight and BMI requirements are in a healthy range, and the attendants know 
upfront, is it really that terrible to ensure that they aren't spending money they don't need to? What do you think?

Yes, gas prices are rising, which means airfares are rising too. But one airline, Ryanair, thinks they have figured out 
how to keep their fuel costs in check: by telling flight attendants to lose some weight.
Apparently, the budget Irish airline will do anything it takes to keep its famously low prices low (like $20 flights 
around Europe)-even if that means encouraging its female crew to slim down. And their incentive to do so? A 
chance to appear in Ryanair's porn-like 'Girls of Ryanair' calendar.
Hmm, being told by your employer to drop some pounds so you can pose nearly naked in their creepy calendar for 
the entire company and its customers to see? Well, if that's not an incentive to lose weight, I don't know what is.
According to Ryanair spokesperson, Stephen McNamara, their focus has nothing to do with sexualizing their 
employees-it's all about keeping fares low (of course!):
We cut costs wherever possible, and the changes will represent a significant reduction in weight. Fuel is an integral 
part of the fare - you can't fly passengers anywhere without it.
Other cost-cutting measures Ryanair has implemented include using less ice in the drinks, cutting the size of its in-
flight magazine, charging to use the restroom on board, and even imposing a "fat tax" at one point for passengers 
who were overweight.
Oh, and in case you're wondering, the airline didn't comment on what incentive male crew members have to stay 
trim.
Way to go, Ryanair.

Ryanair is infamous for its cost-cutting prowess, but with jet fuel prices still rising, it's going further than ever to trim 
the bill.
The budget airline is getting increasingly imaginative. Here are some of the things it's doing, according to Oliver 
Smith at The Telegraph:
It's encouraging cabin crews to watch their weight, and incentivizing it with the potential of appearing in the annual 
Ryanair calendar
The in-flight magazine is being cut down in size and will double as a menu
There will be less ice taken aboard flights, and it's reducing the weight of its seats and trolleys
Ryanair even considered, but didn't go through with, the idea of removing all the armrests on the plane
The next step? Ryanair's a big supporter of the "fat tax," which looks to charge overweight passengers extra.

A top lawyer for the European Court of Justice has said that Irish low-budget carrier Ryanair should pay 
compensation for passengers who were stranded during a volcanic eruption in Iceland in 2010.
 Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will likely have to compensate passengers who weren't able to continue their flights 
due to a 2010 eruption of an Icelandic volcano under the Eyjafjallajokull glacier. The air traffic disruption was 
caused by fears that the volcanic ashes might damage jet engines.
 Ryanair is fighting a 1,130-euro ($1,500) compensation claim for food and accommodation incurred by an Irish 
customer who had her flight back to Dublin cancelled and was only able to return a week later.
 A lawyer for the EU Court of Justice, Advocate General Yves Bot, found on Thursday that the passenger's claim 
was justified. He pointed to EU regulations which forced airlines to look after their clients even when flight 
cancellations were due to extraordinary circumstances and beyond the control of carriers.
 "There is no room for a separate category of particularly extraordinary events which would fully release the air 
carrier from its obligations," Bot said in a statement. But he added that apart from the costs for food and 
accommodation, airlines should be spared from having to pay passengers extra damages, if they were not directly 
responsible for flight cancellations or delays.
 Lost the battle, but not the war?
 A definitive ruling will only be available in a couple of months, though. Advocate generals only provide a 
preliminary, non-binding opinion on cases handled by the European Court of Justice. However, the Luxembourg-
based body more often than not follows their advice in its final rulings.
 Ryanair has frequently branded the European Union's new passenger rights rules as unfair. In April 2011, the Irish 
carrier introduced a two-euro surcharge on all its flights to cover compensation costs it had already been forced to 
pay.
 Advocate General Yves Bot noted that the move could not be held against Ryanair as airlines were free to pass on 
costs resulting from the EU's regulations to their ticket prices.

One of the leading low-cost airlines JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU) is now contemplating the acquisition of a 
stake in one of its interline partners, Aer Lingus Group plc (AERL).
 The Irish Flag carrier, Aer Lingus, which is partly owned by peer Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY) and the 
government of Ireland is planning to sell approximately a 25% stake to JetBlue. According to market reports, Aer 
Lingus' current market capitalization is approximately (EURO)461 million, and the stake owned by the government 
(approximately 25.4%) is valued at (EURO)116 million. If the stake sold is entirely government owned, it is 
estimated that JetBlue will have to shell out approximately (EURO)134 million (the balance being the premium to be 
paid to the government).
 The deal appears to be a government move, given that the European sovereign debt crisis that has forced it toward 
privatization, in an attempt to cover deficits. But possibilities of Ryanair Holdings (the principal owner with a 29.8% 
stake) selling its share cannot be ruled out.
 JetBlue is considered a preferred choice of investors owing to its strong financial position with unrestricted cash 
and short-term investments of $1.2 billion plus a strong foothold in the U.S. market.
 However, considering the current scenario in the global airline industry in which carriers are struggling to run 
operations profitability, the financial viability of the proposed deal still remains in question. If JetBlue moves ahead 
with the deal, the agreement would mark an important step in shaping its international market presence, diversifying 
its business strategy from being primarily a domestic carrier. But we believe any financial synergy arising out of this 
deal will be difficult to estimate in the near term.
 The airline industry was hit hard by the unrelenting market turmoil and rising fuel costs in 2011 after a strong 
rebound in 2010. Unfortunately, we don't expect a marked improvement in 2012. Conditions could in fact worsen, 
given Europe's weak outlook and its financial problems, which have effectively halved global airline profits the 2010 
peak.
JetBlue-Aer Lingus Buyout Plan - Analyst Blog
 Going by the recent reports of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), airlines saw their profits plunging 
more than 85%, from where they are expected to fall further in the current year due to the Euro-zone crisis. In such 
a situation, JetBlue's new deal may further stress, its healthy liquidity position notwithstanding.
 The carrier already remains pressured by high operating costs. Besides fuel cost, the carrier will also remain 
impacted by heavy maintenance expenses throughout this year due to the gradual aging of the fleet. A big fleet of 
A320s, the company acquired in mid-2000s is due for restoration works this year.
 As a result, JetBlue estimates capital expenditures of $645 million for the year, mostly (approximately $430 million) 
dedicated to aircraft expenses. In addition, the company is also obligated toward debt maturities and capital lease 
payments of over $200 million.
 In terms of Aer Lingus financials, the company reported a 6.4% decline in adjusted operating profits in 2011. The 
carrier's debt position increased at a rate of 7.8% year over year to (EURO)577.2 million versus gross cash that 
inched up 1.1% year over year to (EURO)894.8 million in 2011. Passenger growth of 1.8% in 2011 has also been 
less than impressive and the carrier has already projected that it foresees lower additions given difficult market 
conditions.
 Considering all the pros and cons of buying the stake, JetBlue's next step toward the deal will be something to look 
forward to.
 We maintain our long-term Neutral recommendation on JetBlue. For the short-term (1-3 months) the stock holds a 
Zacks #2 Rank (Buy rating).

The one thing we remember best from Production and Operations Management class is Ryanair CEO Michael O' 
Leary's famous quote: "No, it's not war, it's peace. We want a little piece of who, a little piece of Stansted, a little 
piece of Germany, a little piece of Italy, and a big piece of Easyjet."
In the run-up to our first integrative exercise at the end of this week, I'll tell you how our Saturday snowboarding 
excursion to Les Diablerets was a little piece of everything:
Accounting - Pro forma income statement per person for a day of snowboarding
Revenue CHF 0
COGS CHF 0
Gross Profit CHF 0
Overheads (snowboard rental + lift ticket) CHF 115
Transportation costs (train ticket) CHF 27
Depreciation CHF 2
(Investment in ski pants: CHF 100, straight-line depreciation over a useful
life of 5 years with 5 day trips per year - hopefully)
Other Operating Expenses (lunch and drinks) CHF 15
Operating Profit (Loss) (CHF 169)
Thankfully, no interest and tax expenses... yet... (until I start paying Billag)...
A little piece of... everything!
Finance - Net Present Value of a year's worth of snowboarding, given UBS savings account interest rate (the 
opportunity cost of spending on snowboarding) of 0.25%
= - CHF 169* 5/ (1.0025) = - CHF 842.89
Economics - In accordance with the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, the marginal utility of 1 day in the dungeons 
is low, but that of 1 day on the slopes is high. Hence, with one Saturday break from classes, we were able to 
increase our total utility by spending that day on the slopes.
Production and Operations Management - Estimated cycle time for ski rental process = 20 minutes. Throughput 
time = 45 minutes. Bottlenecks where work-in-progress accumulates: scanning and payment queues.
Entrepreneurship - Spend entire day at nursery slope, and get refund on chairlift ticket in cash. New source of 
income: cash balance, estimated return rate 4% (Source: Toy World case)
Leadership - Matching people with similar ability levels and scheduling needs, we were able to put together a group 
for Les Diablerets on Saturday and another for Verbier on Sunday. The result: more happy faces!
... and Leadership failures, such as forgetting to get the ski maps until we were on top of the mountain, and then 
proceeding to careen down the wrong slope. End result: Instead of getting back to Les Diablerets village, the piste 
stops abruptly at the bottom of a button lift, and team gets separated as different members fall off or get off their 
respective buttons at different points along the way back up the mountain.
And in honour of our first Economics quiz last week, we wrap up with "the dismal science" of Economics all over 
again. Before we came to IMD, we were Libertarians, which is why we believed that an MBA would give us a leg up 
in the market economy. Enter the dungeons and Plato's Republic, and the pendulum swings right in the other 
direction as we gave up our individual spoils (such as Toblerone winnings and class notes) towards the common 
good. So there was no longer an incentive for extra effort, until the SABRE marketing simulation came along and 
we celebrated our victories with music and whoops that were audible right at the other end of the dungeons. Then, 
we realized that nobody is king for long and in a market with perfect competition, abnormal profits will always get 
wiped out. 
So what do we do next? Sit back and eat bonbons!
Yours,
Hwei-Yi

NYT aviation blogger Nicola Clark takes a positive view of the program:
On a flight from Amsterdam to São Paulo this week, for example, you could have chosen the director of a British 
answering service, who has a passion for reggae and jazz; an Italian chemical engineer fluent in Dutch, English, 
Spanish and Portuguese; or a Norwegian alternative-rock fan en route to visit family in Argentina.
We worry that "Meet & Seat" will be used instead for Facebook-stalking strangers and securing seats next to

DUBLIN (AP) - Online payments company PayPal announced Tuesday it is expanding its operations in jobs-hungry 
Ireland in a government-sponsored deal praised by Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny.
PayPal, a division of the internet auction company eBay Inc., already employs about 1,500 people in the Dublin 
suburb of Blanchardstown. The company said its new site in the border town of Dundalk will hire 1,000 more over 
the coming four years.
Since the late 1980s Ireland has wooed about 600 American high-tech companies to Ireland, including social media 
giants Google, Facebook and Twitter. PayPal's new investment is receiving a confidential level of aid from the 
government's foreign investment recruitment agency, the IDA.
At a joint Dublin press conference with PayPal executives, Kenny said the San Jose, California-based company's 
decision represents "a clear recognition of the opportunities that Ireland offers global leaders like PayPal."
Kenny's year-old government is hoping that multinational companies based in Ireland will lead the country to 
economic recovery. Multinationals provide just 5 percent of jobs but generate nearly 20 percent of gross domestic 
product in Ireland, a country that exports four-fifths of its goods and services, chiefly to Britain and the United 
States.
Irish unemployment stands near a two-decade high approaching 15 percent, emigration is rising for the first time 
since the early 1990s, and the government's own ability to stimulate domestic demand is extremely limited by 
austerity demands tied to its 2010 bailout by the European Union and International Monetary Fund.
Online auction site eBay acquired PayPal in 2002. A year later PayPal opened its European base in 
Blanchardstown with just 25 employees. Today's site manages 42 million PayPal accounts in Europe, the Middle 
East and Africa. Worldwide, the company allows customers to send and receive payments on the Internet in more 
than two dozen currencies.
Louise Phelan, vice president of global operations for PayPal in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said the 
company hoped to have at least 200 Dundalk positions filled by July in customer support, sales, finance and 
compliance.
PayPal Set To Create 1,000 New Jobs In Ireland
Phelan said she was "very proud to support Irish job creation" and credited IDA support as instrumental. She said 
PayPal was aiming "to help people pay for things anytime, anywhere and on any type of electronic device."

Britain's easy to offend Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) recently deemed Ryanair's flight-attendants-in-their-
underwear campaign too offensive for public consumption.
The ASA pulled the plug on the newspaper ad, which featured Ryanair staffers posing under the headline "RED 
HOT FARES & CREW," after receiving 17 complaints that it was offensive and objectified women.
While the ads seemed mild to us (the feminist blog Jezebel noted, "meh, I've seen worse"), it's hardly a surprise 
that the ban-happy ASA axed the campaign.
The ASA is a self-regulatory watchdog that watches over advertising in the Britain. While it looks into 10 to 15 
questionable ads a week, it takes only one public complaint for the ASA to ax an ad ... and complainers have taken 
full advantage.
The ban-happy ASA has pulled the trigger on everything from ads spouting misinformation to ads featuring 
excessive cleavage to over-Photoshopped advertorials.
While some praise it for being an equal opportunity censor (it has dropped the hammer on Israeli tourism ads that 
pretend Palestinian territories don't exist and Palestinian tourism ads that pretend Israel doesn't exist), others 
complain there's neither rhyme nor reason to its rationale. An ad featuring an underweight model for the Drop Dead 
fashion website was banned, but an ad for H&M featuring a similarly emaciated model avoided censure.
The ASA noted that "Although we acknowledged that the women in the ads had consented to appear in the 
calendar, we considered that the ads were likely to cause widespread offense, when displayed in a national 
newspaper, and therefore concluded that they breached the [advertising] code."
(This was the calendar that accompanied the newspaper ad campaign.)
This online ad for clothing line Drop Dead was banned in November 2011 after the ASA received one complaint 
regarding its underweight model. ASA called Drop Dead "socially irresponsible" for portraying the image in which 
featured the "hollows in her thighs" and highly visible ribs and collar bones.

This ad for Lynx (the British equivalent of Axe) was banned in November for being "sexually suggestive, indecent, 
provocative."

The UK's Advertising Standards Authority are back, this time putting a stop to the above lingerie ad. Which seems 
pretty tame as far as lingerie ads go, until you take a moment to realize they are not selling a raised bust and more 
eye-catching cleavage, they're advertising... an airline.
The "budget airline" Ryanair apparently offers a cabin crew comprised of hot women in their underwear-so a 
breastraunt in the vein of Hooters, only there aren't mediocre wings and it flies-and uses the slogan "RED HOT 
FARES & CREW!"
The ads ran in several newspapers until the ASA's hammer came down. They said:
"We also considered that most readers would interpret these images, in conjunction with the text ... and the names 
of the women, as linking female cabin crew with sexually suggestive behavior. Although we acknowledged that the 
women in the ads had consented to appear in the calendar, we considered that the ads were likely to cause 
widespread offense, when displayed in a national newspaper, and therefore concluded that they breached the 
[advertising] code."
Apparently it all started with a petition-now with 11,000+ signatures-spearheaded by an incensed flight attendant.
I'm a member of an airline Cabin Crew and what's more I love my job. My work colleagues, many of whom are 
male, work hard with me to ensure the safety of our passengers. Safety is our number one priority, not the brand of 
our underwear.
A lot of people are going to these ads are fine and the ASA is going to too far and blah blah blah nanny state, and 
we agree they're not very provocative (they're certainly not on par with a hair salon advertising a chic haircut to go 
with your sexy domestic violence). They are, however, a lame way to sell cheap airfare. Whether or not that's a 
banning offense is another matter.

Feb. 16, 2012 (China Knowledge) - Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd, or COMAC, a leading aircraft 
manufacturer in the country, yesterday inked an agreement to acquire 20 C919 aircraft orders from BOC Aviation 
Pte Ltd, a unit of Bank of China<601988><3988>, at the Singapore Airshow 2012 from Feb. 14 to Feb. 19. 
The new deal brought the C919 orders of COMAC, today named AVIC Landing Gear Advanced Manufacturing Co, 
to 235 units, said a person familiar with the matter. Presence at the signing ceremony were Chen Si Qing, chairman 
of BOC and executive VP, COMAC chairman Jin Zhuanglong, Robert Martin, managing director and CEO of BOC 
Aviation and Wu Guanghui, the VP and Chief Designer of the C919.

China Southern Airlines Co<600029><1055>, have ordered a total of 215 C919 from COMAC. Foreign airlines like 
RyanAir has also inked a MOU to acquire C919 with financing facilities provided by Chinese banks. The C919 
aircraft is expected to start trial flight in 2014 and be delivered starting from 2016. 
COMAC aims to have as many as 300 C919 orders by the end of this year, said Chief Designer Wu Guanghui. In 
addition, COMAC expect to ink an agreement with Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft manufacturer, within two 
months for jet development, said Vice President Han Kecen. 
Many more orders are expected to come from the Chinese customers with business jets that are seeing a potential

Ltd's agreement to buy three Embraer's Lineage 1000 ultra-large executive jets, first sale of two Piaggio Avanti II, 
and other major manufactures. 
With growing aviation industry and strong increase in Chinese outbound travel market the demand for more civilian 
airports, MRO and business travel related services are expected to see more foreign companies entering China. 
Industry cluster facilities catering to the aviation industry are gradually integrated into major industrial parks across 
China. Most notably is the Aviation Park located in Beijing E-Town in Daxing District in southern Beijing. Its joint 
partner is the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp that creates a 2 km sq of area for the high-tech 
aerospace-equipment manufacturing. With the coming second airport in the area Beijing E-Town will attract

The UK's advertising regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two adverts by the low-cost 
airline Ryanair for being too sexually suggestive. The adverts, which were published in national newspapers, 
showed two female cabin crew members in their underwear. The headline stated "RED HOT FARES & CREW!!!" 
and advertised the airline's low fares and the 2012 cabin crew charity calendar. The adverts attracted complaints 
that they were sexist and objectified women, particularly female cabin crew, and were offensive and unsuitable for 
display in national newspapers. Defending the adverts, Ryanair said that the images of the women were taken 
directly from their 2012 calendar and, because the crew had volunteered to produce and promote the calendar, the 
images could not be said to be sexist or to objectify women. Ryanair also said that as similar images are often 
featured in the same media, the adverts could not be said to be unsuitable for public display. The ASA disagreed, 
finding that, though the adverts were not overtly sexual, the appearance, stance and gaze of the women were 
sexually suggestive. It also believed that most readers would interpret the images and the text "RED 
HOT...CREW!!!" as linking female cabin crew with sexually suggestive behaviour. As such, the adverts would be 
likely to cause widespread offence.
The ASA did not comment specifically on whether the images objectified women or were sexist, however it made 
clear that sexually suggestive adverts such as these are likely to cause offence and do not belong in the national 
newspapers. The trick of using a scantily-clad model to grab attention for (often unconnected) goods or services 
may be an old one, but beware that the ASA has been clamping down on them (see for example the recent 
adjudications on Marks & Spencer and Lynx).

A handful of airline Ryanair's ads featuring an underwear-clad flight attendant with the caption "Red Hot Fares & 
Crew!" have been banned, shockingly.
Ryanair, which is easily in the running for one of the most ass-backwardly run businesses ever, released the ads 
this past December, prompting an investigation from the Advertising Standard Authority to determine whether the 
ads were offensive enough to warrant removal. At the time, we wondered exactly how long it takes to determine 
whether something is offensive. Turns out it takes roughly two months.
The ASA has banned the ads, according to Morningstar Online, after a grassroots campaign (aptly titled "Cabin 
Crew Against Sexism") protested. Apparently, they felt that plastering the image of a nearly nude flight attendant 
somehow undermined the critical roles that the cabin crew plays in maintaining order and safety on flights. No 
kidding.

THE grounding of Malev, Hungary's national carrier, shows once again how Eastern European countries are 
struggling to fly their flags around the world. According to a report from CAPA, Hungary is now expected to follow 
Slovakia in switching to a predominantly low-cost carrier (LCC) market. The report notes that, prior to Malev's 
bankruptcy, LCCs accounted for just 24% of capacity in Hungary, compared with more than 70% for its neighbour 
to the north. That figure shot up to 40% overnight, and with Ryanair circling covetously above will only rise further.
But there are few positive signs for Eastern Europe's older airlines. Slovakia has a high LCC penetration because it 
abandoned its flag carrier in 2007. Lithuania did the same thing two years later, while Latvia clung onto its national 
airline, but only by marketing it as a pseudo-LCC with pan-Baltic aspirations-baffling analysts, and perhaps 
government financiers, in the process. Poland and Romania seem no more confident in their flag carriers, beating 
paths to Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates for financial backing and feed-in traffic. While none would 
admit it, they are all perilously close to their own Malev moment.
Malev itself stopped flying after its suppliers, spooked by an EU ruling that the airline return $390m in state aid, 
demanded up-front payment for their services. However, this was much more than a cashflow problem. Hungary, 
like others, was styling itself as an upcoming East-to-West hub. It had noticed that the Gulf's three big carriers-
Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways-were scooping up intercontinental traffic at an extraordinary pace. It had 
noticed, too, the response of the legacy carriers in Western Europe. Nursing hangovers from years of operational 
profligacy, they had retreated to their hubs and were abandoning routes to Eastern Europe. Hungary needed to hit 
back.
Malev's strategy was to develop its home base (Budapest Liszt Ferenc airport) as a regional hub with spokes 
extending across Europe, sustained by transit traffic from its partners in the oneworld alliance and elsewhere. The 
model was remarkably similar to the ones currently pursued by Poland, Romania, Slovenia and the Czech 
Republic-all of whom want to become the region's dominant hub. But while axing unprofitable long-haul routes was 
sensible, Malev found it no easier making money in the short-haul sector. The Hungarian market is simply too 
small, saddling operators with low occupancy rates and punishingly high overheads. Whenever a new route 
became viable it was swooped on by LCCs like Wizz Air.
Flagging carriers out east
Sadly, the contraction of Malev's route network is now being mimicked across the region. TAROM, the Romanian 
flag carrier, has also scrapped long-haul routes, leaving it with less capacity than the three LCCs parked up at 
Bucharest's secondary Baneasa airport. Flight movements in Ukrainian airspace have increased six-fold since 
1993, and yet traffic among domestic operators has only doubled. LOT, the Polish flag carrier, may have fared 
better, preserving long-haul connections and inching closer to a deal with Turkish Airlines. But Istanbul, like its 
insatiable Gulf rivals, is spoilt for choice. It has also been courted by Slovenia's Adria Airways, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina's B&H Airlines, and CSA Czech Airlines. Even if there is room for another European hub connecting 
Asia to the Americas, the trouble is everyone wants it on their turf.
Hanging a 40,000-foot curtain
The options on the table for Eastern Europe's flag carriers are worryingly limited. Let's generously presume two 
succeed in their stated hub goals, securing catchment areas large enough to hoover up transit traffic from bordering 
countries. What, then, of the rest? The transport ministers of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia recently mulled over one 
solution-a shared Baltic carrier for all three countries, akin to Scandinavia's SAS or Central America's TACA-but 
their plan quickly hit political rocks. A wider point-to-point alliance across the entire bloc would be even harder to 
negotiate. And in its absence, notwithstanding modest operational gains from new regional jets, the LCC vultures 
will continue circling. The next time you complain about your American or Western European legacy airline, spare a 
thought for those who face the real prospect of flying with Ryanair as their national carrier.

Controversial Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary had to call for police protection after an angry mob of unemployed 
Spanair workers sought to attack him, Irish Central reports.
O'Leary had been at Bilbao Airport in Spain announcing new Ryanair routes when he apparently flashed a "v for 
victory" sign at the workers, who were protesting the loss of their jobs after the collapse of Spain's fourth largest 
airline.
The announcement at Bilbao airport seems to tie into a strategy by O'Leary to move into areas when other airlines, 
crushed by the euro crisis, pull out. When Hungary's Malev suspended operations earlier this week, the Irish budget 
airline announced a new hub in Budapest within hours.
This footage, taken from Spanish TV, shows the gesture:

DESPITE hostility from many foreign governments and airlines the European Union last month went ahead and 
introduced a requirement for airlines to buy permits to cover the carbon-dioxide emissions of all flights into and out 
of European airports, including the portion of those flights that is outside EU airspace. China was one of the states 
most vehemently opposed to Europe's unilateral imposition of this "carbon tax" and today the Chinese official news 
agency Xinhua said the government had banned the country's airlines both from buying permits and from adding 
supplements to their ticket prices to cover their cost. In theory the EU could now ban Chinese airlines from 
European airspace, possibly triggering a horrendous global trade war. But in practice the airlines have until early 
next year to account for this year's emissions, so there is still plenty of time for negotiation. It will be interesting to 
see who blinks first. 
No doubt the Chinese airlines will in public uphold the party line, and continue to protest at being included in 
Europe's emissions-trading scheme (ETS). However, they may privately be looking with envy at the rest of the 
world's carriers, which are free to start adding ETS surcharges to their ticket prices. To explain why, here are some 
rough calculations that Andrew Charlton of Aviation Advocacy, a consultancy, has made about Ryanair's new ETS 
supplement of 25 euro-cents per passenger per flight.

Hungary's national airline Malev ceased operations early on Friday after its planes were held overseas for unpaid 
debts, Reuters reports.
All flights were grounded from 0500 GMT. The airline's website, www.malev.hu, has been replaced with a message 
informing passengers about compensation options.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the decision was made after two aircraft were not allowed to take off 
from Tel Aviv and Ireland. This ends almost 66 years of continuous service for the aircraft carrier.
Over 3,700 Malev passengers have been stranded, and the airline is arranging alternative flights, Malév CEO János 
Berényi told a press conference, according to All Hungary News.
Following an EU ruling against Hungary last month, Malev said its suppliers had lost confidence and started to 
demand advance payment for services, while the government could no longer provide cash injections.
"This has accelerated the outflow of cash to such an extent, that by today the situation of the airline has become 
unsustainable," the airline said on Friday.
To make matters worse, Malev was ordered by the EU to return the $390 million worth of illegal state aid it had 
received between 2007 and 2010, the equivalent of its entire 2010 revenue, Bloomberg reports.
Malev isn't the first airline to fall to the European crisis. Spanair, Spain's fourth biggest airline, went bust last month.
Orban is already plotting Malev's return, but other airlines are already capitalizing on the void it has left: Just seven 
hours after Malev's announcement, Irish airline Ryanair said it was building a new base in Budapest, The Journal 
reports.

THE future of Malev, Hungary's 66-year-old national flag-carrier, has looked bleak since the European Commission 
ruled last month that government aid it had received between 2007 and its renationalisation in 2010 was illegal and 
must be repaid. The deeply indebted airline had no way of paying the money back and indeed was relying on 
continuing state backing to keep going while a buyer was sought. Early on Friday it ceased flying after the 
government-which is suffering a debt crisis of its own-decided to stop financing it.
Viktor Orban, the prime minister, said that restarting Malev was "not impossible". Earlier this week the airline's boss 
had used the same half-hearted phrase to express his hopes of reviving takeover talks with the Chinese state 
owners of Hainan Airlines. However, in the absence of a deep-pocketed rescuer, the loss of confidence an airline 
suffers on grounding its planes tends to prove fatal. Especially when, as in this case, stronger rivals immediately 
swoop in to grab its customers. Ryanair, which only ten days ago had announced plans to open five new routes out 
of Budapest airport, said on Friday that it would increase that to 31 routes, basing a fleet of brand-new Boeing 737-
800s at Budapest from February 17th. Likewise Wizz Air, a Hungarian low-cost carrier, also said it would expand its 
Budapest schedules to fill the gaps left by Malev.

Hungary's heavily debt-ridden national airline Malev has had to ground flights and stop operations just days after 
Spanish state-owned Spanair filed for bankruptcy in light of the European debt crisis.
 Hungarian state-owned airline Malev has gone out of business. Flights were grounded, leaving over 7,000 
passengers stranded and operations were shut down on Friday due to its "unsustainable" financial situation.
 "At 0500 GMT on February 3, after 66 years of almost continuous operation, Malev stopped taking off," chief 
executive Lorant Limburger said at a news conference.
 The airline has debts of around 200 million euros ($270 million) and has had difficulties finding new investors. Last 
month, the European Commission ordered Malev to repay state aid received between 2007 and 2010. The decision 
prevented Hungary from providing liquidity to the airline and prompted partners to ask for "payments in advance 
and claims accelerated incredibly. No company can honor payments months in advance," Malev chief Laszlo 
Berenyi said.
 Budapest had moved Thursday to prevent a forced grounding of its airline, appointing an administrator to shield it 
from creditor claims and also declared it a "strategically important company."
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban told state radio after Friday's announcement, that a new national airline could be 
established if investors were prepared to operate it profitably and risk their own money.
 Aviation crisis
 Malev's is not the only plight in European aviation in light of the euro crises. Spanish airline Spanair also filed for 
bankruptcy at the end of January.
 A spokesman for the International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts a net loss for European carriers of 
around 450 million euros this year.
Hungary 's national airline goes out of business
 Meanwhile, in response to Malev's announcement, the low-cost Irish airline Ryanair said on Friday it is planning 26 
new routes from Budapest, Reuters news agency reported. The new routes are expected to be operating by April 
and will carry up to two million passengers per year.

Carlos Tevez waits to make his Manchester City debut. Will he ever play for the club again? Photo credit: Alfonso 
Jimenez
The January football transfer window has closed with a whimper rather than a bang, most commentators agree. 
While last year's deadline day say record spending of £225 million, this year was a more subdued affair, with the 
Premier League spend coming in at £60 million, according to the BBC.
Clubs are showing financial prudence. The lack of headline-grabbing, big money deals implies that "the Premier 
League is breathing the fresh air of restraint", wrote David Conn in The Guardian. Conn suggested this was due to 
the new UEFA financial fair play rules, which mean if indebted clubs overspend they face serious sanctions. 
However, Conn also pointed out that it is impossible to know at this point whether or not the rules will have a long-
term effect on football spending: "Restless ambition, rich men's impatience and the desperation of strugglers still 
thrash beneath the waters, calmer as they seem."
Carlos Tevez is going nowhere. Manchester City failed to offload striker and former captain Carlos Tevez, setting 
the stage for some serious fireworks. Manager Roberto Mancini said Tevez was "finished" at the club after the 
player apparently refused to come on as a substitute against Bayern Munich last year - and relations have only got 
worse. Tevez is currently in "self-imposed exile" in his homeland of Argentina, reported Sonia Oxley for Reuters, 
and is facing a £1.2 million pound fine from City for flying home without permission. Now that interest from AC 
Milan, Paris St Germain and Inter Milan has come to nothing, the club faces a tricky legal situation, said Oxley: "The 
high-risk option would be to release him and sue him for the loss of a transfer fee that local media estimate at 25-30 
million pounds but there would be no guarantees for City that Tevez would be able to pay it."
A game between Everton and Manchester City was halted after a man chained himself to a goalpost. According to 
The Daily Mail, the man was protesting over Ryanair not employing his daughter. Presumably it's easier - and safer 
- to handcuff yourself to a goalpost than to a Ryanair plane.
Pavlyuchenko out, Saha in. It was a busy transfer deadline day for Tottenham Hotspur, with Roman Pavlyuchenko, 
Steven Pienaar, Sebastien Bassong and Vedran Corluka on the way out; and Louis Saha joining on a free transfer 
from Everton and Ryan Nelson moving to White Hart Lane after Blackburn cancelled the defender's contract. The 
Premier League January transfer window: What you need to know
arrival of 33-year-old Saha raised a few eyebrows, as the striker is notoriously injury-prone: "Saha has managed 20 
appearances this season, scoring just twice," noted Andy Hampson in The Independent.
Queens Park Rangers also hit the transfer day headlines, bringing in striker Bobby Zamora from Fulham and Djibril 
Cisse from Lazio. Manager Mark Hughes told the club website: "I rate Djibril very, very highly. I've watched him for 
many years and always been impressed by what he brings to the table."
Cahill to Chelsea, Terry on trial. Gary Cahill's move from Bolton Wanderers to Chelsea was one of the top ten 
transfers of the winter window, according to Goal: "Cahill adds some much needed depth to the Chelsea back line, 
and looks set to earn himself a starting berth alongside club icon John Terry." And speaking of Terry, the Chelsea 
captain has entered a plea of not guilty to a "racially aggravated public order offence", reported The Telegraph. 
Terry allegedly racially abused Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during a match last year. The trial 
is scheduled for 9 July; the Chelsea player is expected to captain England during Euro 2012 in June.

So...why was that guy doing that, exactly? According to the Guardian, he was protesting the Irish airline Ryanair:
Never before has a Premier League match been interrupted by a middle-aged man protesting about Ryanair's 
recruitment policies on the basis that his daughter did not get a job with the airline.
Well, she's gonna score a cushy gig with Ryanair now.

AN ARTICLE in this week's Economist looks at Boeing and its struggles to fill its orders.
At Boeing's Renton factory near Seattle the existing version of the 737 is now being turned out at a record rate of 
35 a month, after a recent speeding-up of the two assembly lines. At the front of assembly line number one, a plane 
destined for flydubai, an airline that can't afford capital letters, is ready to roll. Behind it is the latest addition to 
Ryanair's huge fleet of 737s, which has just had its engines fitted. Next, a Korean Air plane which is about to 
receive rows of seats; then an Azerbaijan Airlines jet, its toilet cubicles lined up alongside ready for installation. The 
plan is to increase the production rate further, to 42 a month by 2014. Fortunately, there is space to squeeze a third 
assembly line into the giant hangar.
Read the whole piece.

· SWISS International Airlines is-by some distance-the best of the European short-haul carriers according to a new 
survey. Its "customer score", in a poll of more than 6,000 people by Which?, a consumer watchdog, was 76%. Aer 
Lingus came second with 67%. Swiss was the only airline to receive a five-star rating for its check-in procedure, 
and the only one to earn four-star ratings for its cabin environment and value for money. The table was propped up 
by Thomas Cook Airlines in 19th place on 37%, just behind Ryanair on 38%. Which? notes that Ryanair gets four 
stars for its costs, but only two stars for "value for money". "Passengers have perhaps realised the hard way", went 
the write-up, "that cheaper doesn't necessarily mean better."
· A report by Amadeus (pdf), a company that provides technology to the travel industry, looks at the way technology 
is changing the face of travel. There's talk of translation tools, augmented-reality tools, intelligent-recommendation 
tools and luggage that can let you know where it is. One of the outcomes of these developments is that business 
travellers will morph into "business tourists", thanks to all the useful new services that hotels will provide. We can 
but hope.
· This is not very recent, but Brendan Nelson's take on the military strategies needed to get a seat on London's 
public transport during rush hour is beautifully put together.

Via David Lucas (whom the Kats thank) comes a YouTube link to this interview with Michael O'Leary at the 
Innovation Convention 2011. Michael is CEO of Ryanair, an airline on which this Kat does not propose to pass 
comment. Asked about IP and the patent system, Michael felt that it did indeed support committed scientists and 
medical research and that it encouraged R&D. He also agreed with a position which this Kat has supported from 
time to time, that the tax system could be put to better use in creating and steering business incentives into desired 
forms of investment and business development.
On trolls and traffic wardens. One of the IPKat's readers, inspired by some of the vitriolic comments with which 
many folk who inhabit the social media greeted the news that Sisvel International had acquired more than 450 
Nokia patents, most of which relate to wireless technologies, was moved to comment as follows:
"This anti-troll vitriol made me think that our collective distaste for trolls is in fact comparable to the instinctive dislike 
some people have for traffic wardens, or indeed the police. The analogy is useful because it casts a light on where 
the problem lies: more (much more) in the audience than in the actors. Here a purchaser whose business it is to 
manage IP has bought a partially licensed FRAND portfolio from a company which can revert to what is (or should 
be) their primary business: making products and selling services. It is placing policing in the hands of a professional 
policeman. If, as a result, the recalcitrant potential licensees are brought into line and take FRAND licences (as 
others have already done) then the seller, purchaser and -- most importantly -- existing licensees all benefit. The 
benefit to existing licensees comes from the removal of what otherwise is a market advantage for the recalcitrant. If 
the portfolio isn't just a try-on (and, remember, these were Nokia patents, so they did come from a practising entity), 
does it not then make sense to pass responsibility for policing the market to someone whose job it is to do that?
Seen in this light, the real objections to the acquisition arise for the same reason that people dislike traffic wardens: 
because the wardens make them obey the law. I in fact prefer the police analogy because it catches the broader 
audience. It's not just criminals but also those who want to deal with criminals who distrust the police. The broader 
short-term consumer interest is bound to dislike policing of recalcitrant licensees since this adds to costs and drives 
up prices or reduces choice. But a consumer with a long-term outlook would realise that an orderly, well policed 
market for the fruits of innovation in fact encourages development and drives down average costs of 
dissemination. The enlightened view is therefore to welcome this disposal and hope it is a sign of things to 
come". Bravo, says Merpel: the analogy is a good one. But how contingent is it on the fact that the Nokia is 
Monday miscellany Part 2
FRAND-friendly? The patent policing function of Sisvel (or any other enforcer) may struggle to curry public favour in 
technologies or for portfolios where FRAND licensing, and therefore fair and easy access to the patented 
technology, is not an option.
Emailing the IPKat all the way from the UK Intellectual Property Office is Matthew Navarra, who is bubbling with 
enthusiasm to tell Kats and other creatures about the IPO's burgeoning list of forthcoming events. So many and 
varied are these events that there's no way this weblog can list them all, but if you are interested in seeing what's 
coming up, this is where to look.
The IPKat thanks his friend Zuzana Hecko (Allen & Overy Bratislava, s.r.o.) for drawing his attention to the following 
very recently European Commission studies on trade secrets and parasitic copying. The Kat hasn't yet had a 
chance to read his way through all of this yet, and hopes that one of his kind readers might nobly sacrifice a few 
precious hours to provide a neat summary:

The problem with tech is that the really cool stuff doesn't usually turn up. 
Get the latest Mobile Devices at Mobile Phone Advisor
From the jetpacks we were promised as kids to Intel's latest concept PCs, what we actually end up with tends to be 
considerably more mundane - Ryanair instead of jetpacks, or incremental improvements on kit we've already got.
The iPhone was the exception. It was the jetpack, the flying car, the house on the moon and the food in pill form, 
the outrageous promise actually delivered. 
Where other phones had clearly been made, the iPhone could have been recovered from the wreckage at Roswell, 
evidence of an alien civilisation who'd never discovered cut, copy and paste.
The iPhone turned five yesterday, and I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that it completely transformed mobile 
tech. Before iPhones we had Orange SPVs and shoebox-sized BlackBerries. Now, we get goodies such as Sony's 
Xperia S, Android powerhouses and a really nice mobile Windows.
Are you an Android fan? If it weren't for the iPhone, you'd have a Google-powered Blackberry.
Something kinda ooh
The most important thing about the iPhone, to me at least, wasn't the hardware. It was the way people reacted to it: 
it generated so many oohs and aahs from people that you'd think Apple had made a baby, not a pocket computer.
I've never heard people talk about gadgets in the way people did (and do) about the iPhone. People - normal 
people, I mean, the kind of people who couldn't care less about tech - were smitten.
That never happened with a BlackBerry 8100 or an Orange SPV.
Have others copied Apple? Of course, and that's good. Apple changed the game, and everybody with a 
smartphone benefited. 
Gary Marshall: The iPhone changed everything
Today's smartphones - and their bigger brothers, tablets - are things of wonder, the sort of objects you'd previously 
see on TV programmes set hundreds of years in the future. Whether your weapon of choice is Android or iOS, 
Mango or BlackBerry, it owes the original iPhone an enormous debt.

Oh dear... It would seem that the retail shit is really hitting the fan. Following my earlier Sears news, now it would 
appear that J. C. Penney has fallen out of love with Saatchi's Kev "I always wear black" Roberts and his LoveMarks

Michael O'Leary, the famously charismatic CEO of Irish budget airline Ryanair, is known for pushing the limits of air 
travel when it comes to keeping fares low. 
In 2008, the low-cost carrier began levying a £6 (about $8.40) administrative fee on debit and credit card payments.
Click here to see past cost-cutting measures > 
Today, Ryanair is pledging to keep the last-minute booking fee, despite the Treasury's plans to ban airlines and 
other businesses from tacking on hidden charges to Internet transactions. 
Ryanair is trying to wriggle its way around the proposed legislation by claiming that the credit and debit card 
surcharge is an "administrative fee," and not a processing fee passed on by the banks, according to The Daily Mail. 
In September 2011, the low-cost carrier launched its own pre-paid card, "Ryanair Cash Passport," as the only way 
for passengers to avoid booking fees. 
Any passenger that purchases the prepaid MasterCard and does not use it after six months, however, will face an 
inactivity fee of £2.50 (about $3.50) per month.
Ready to see all the other crazy things Ryanair has done to keep flights super cheap?
Introducing standing-room-only seating 
In July 2010, Ryanair introduced plans to charge passengers £4 (about $6) for standing-room-only seats.
The proposal involved removing the back 10 rows of seats from the airline's 250 planes and replacing them with 15 
rows of vertical seats. 
Ryanair claimed to be shopping the idea to Boeing, but the jetmaker wasn't too fond of bypassing European safety 
regulations to help customers save a few pennies.

Asking overweight passengers to pay more
In 2009, Ryanair proposed a "fat tax" for overweight passengers after one-third of travelers voted in favor of the 
extra charge in an online poll conducted by the Irish carrier, according to The Guardian. 
One month later, the airline said it was dumping the contentious tactic because there was no way to collect the 
money without causing delays. 
Charging customers to use the toilet
In 2009, Ryanair considered charging passengers £1 (about $1.40) to use the toilets on board.
CEO Michael O'Leary told the BBC:
One thing we have looked at in the past, and are looking at again, is the possibility of maybe putting a coin slot on 
the toilet door, so that people might actually have to spend a pound to spend a penny in future. 
In 2011, the airline confirmed it was dropping the coin-operated scheme in favor of another controversial plan.

American Apparel's racy ads no longer come as a surprise -- that's its brand equity.
But Christmas, winter and the holidays present a particular creative challenge for CEO Dov Charney (who oversees 
his ads directly): What does sexy look like when most of the world is bundled up in coats and scarves?
Fortunately -- or not, depending on your taste -- Charney has come up with an answer: Nothing says Hanukkah like 
the gold lamé disco shorts pictured here.
That's not all. Check out our gallery of AA's current crop of seasonal ads. (Just bear in mind that there are some 
things you can't un-see.)
WANT MORE? Check out Business Insider's new Advertising news channel.
Bundle up!
This one is reminiscent of photos that have emerged from Charney's 'personal' collection ...
(Which you can see here if you really want - NSFW.)
... as is this one.

HAVING spent the last few months compiling a book of business quotations for The Economist, this Gulliver has 
been struck by just how many zingers have emanated from the world of aviation. I find it refreshing that, in an age 
where executives are becoming ever more anodyne, the industry still has its share of plain-speaking characters. 
One reason is that airlines, alongside sports teams and media groups, are among the few companies sexy enough 
to attract a certain type of brash businessman-often regardless of a firm's economic prospects. It is hard to imagine 
characters such as Ryanair's Michael O'Leary or Southwest's Herb Kelleher being tempted into the paperclip-
manufacturing business. (Lord King, then chairman of British Airways, said that if "Richard Branson had worn a pair 
of steel-rimmed glasses, a double-breasted suit and shaved off his beard, I would have taken him seriously.") 
For the quotation hunter, it also has another advantage. In recent times it has had two ideologically opposed 
camps-incumbents wishing to protect themselves with regulation, and new entrants espousing the free market-
engaged in a public slanging match. Which is always fun.
So, ladies and gentlemen, sit back, fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the fight. Here are ten of the best quotes I have 
found. Feel free to chip in with your own favourite.
"If the Wright brothers were alive today Wilbur would have to fire Orville to reduce costs." Herb Kelleher, founder of 
Southwest Airlines
"We don't fall over ourselves if they say 'my Granny fell ill'. What part of no refund don't you understand? You're not 
getting a refund so fuck off." Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair
"A recession is when you have to tighten your belt; depression is when you have no belt to tighten. When you've 
lost your trousers-you're in the airline business." Sir Adam Thomson, founder of British Caledonian
"The best thing we can do with environmentalists is shoot them. These headbangers want to make air travel the 
preserve of the rich. They are Luddites marching us back to the 18th century." Michael O'Leary trumpets his green 
credentials
Our favourite air lines
"If someone wanted to pay £5 to go to the toilet I would carry them there myself. I would wipe their bums for a fiver." 
Michael O'Leary again
"Running an airline is like having a baby: fun to conceive, but hell to deliver." CE Woolman, founder of Delta Air 
Lines
"The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, and then 
earns little or no money. Think airlines. Here a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the 
days of the Wright Brothers. Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done 
his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down." Warren Buffett
"It takes nerves of steel to stay neurotic." Herb Kelleher
"Think and act big and grow smaller, or think and act small and grow bigger." Herb Kelleher
"You fucking academic eggheads! You don't know shit. You can't deregulate this industry. You're going to wreck it. 
You don't know a goddamn thing!" Robert Crandall, boss of American Airlines, to an unnamed Senate lawyer in 
1971

Each week, advertisers launch hundreds of new TV ads. Walmart and Target, for instance, have both launched 
about 40 new commercials each for the holiday shopping season. As the campaigns roll out, TV advertising 
research agency Ace Metrix screens each one for more than 500 consumers who then rate them according to 
effectiveness.
An Ace Score of 0 means an ad is a total dog. A nearly impossible top score of 900 means it's a winner.
Last week, retailers debuted a blitz of ads hoping to tempt holiday shoppers. Although Best Buy had a horrible Q3 
2011 its new "Game on Santa" ad did really well with consumers, who rated it the best, most-effective ad of last 
week.
Verizon also did well with two of its ads in the Top 5.
What follows are the top five best new ads of the prior week, with some insight and commentary from Ace Metrix 
CEO Peter Daboll.
Target: "Reindeer House" - Ace Score: 579
It's a 15-second ad, which is unusual. Ads that are 30 seconds long tend to be more effective, Daboll says, so 
anytime a company can get a high-level result from the cheaper, shorter format it's icing on the cake. This ad got to 
the point -- Target sells Garmin GPS products -- extremely quickly.
http://www.youtube.com/embed/21BPbbwqp2k
Subway: Michael Strahan & Justin Tuck - Ace Score 584
NFL stars Michael Strahan and Justin Tuck did well for Subway's December promotion, which also surprised 
Daboll. "I think people respond to the food rather than the celebrities. They can be polarizing because it's about 
whether you like the character or you don't, or you like the team or you don't." (The ad shown here is part of the 
same campaign; the specific ad rated by Ace Metrix was not available.)

http://www.youtube.com/embed/Umh8dNZErdE
Walmart: "Woman Finds Ring In Muffin" - Ace Score: 587
Walmart has launched more than 40 new ads this holiday season. This one did well with older women, Daboll says, 
because it had a sentimental story and was funny. (Apologies for the quality -- Walmart has yet to upload the spot 
to its YouTube channel.)

Extra-marital dating website AshleyMadison.com has erected a billboard of serial adulterer and presidential hopeful 
Newt Gingrich in Bucks County, Pennsylvania that reads: "Faithful Republican, Unfaithful Husband. Welcome to the 
AshleyMadison.com Era."
Given that Gingrich's edge in the polls has recently been dwindling, could the former Speaker's clinching of the 
coveted pro-adultery demographic be just what his campaign needs?
Considering that the thrice-married Republican candidate recently took a "no-adultery pledge" to increase his clout -
- much to the glee of snarky political bloggers -- it's probably not what the Team Newt had in mind. But according to 
Ashley Madison CEO Noel Biderman, the billboard can only help him.
"We thought that this was the most appropriate way to contribute to the campaign," Biderman told Business Insider. 
"Seeing [Gingrich] as a human and flawed makes him more relatable. Just because someone has an affair doesn't 
mean that they aren't personally capable of leading a state or city or country."
In fact, Biderman continued that without adulterous leaders like FDR, JFK, and Clinton, "our country would be 
decimated." 
Gingrich was not Ashley Madison's first choice. Biderman reached out to Herman Cain last week to be the site's 
president of international affairs.
"We offered to pay him the same salary that he would have gotten as president," Biderman told B.I., but Cain did 
not respond to the $400,000 offer.
"It's not the first time we've been left at the altar," Biderman said. 
But Ashley Madison, which caters to 12 million users from 7 countries, has moved on. There is currently one 
Gingrich billboard in the Pennsylvania swing county, and Biderman said he has at least two more billboards in the 
works.
The Gingrich campaign did not respond to a message requesting comment.

Michael O'Leary, the EU's equivalent of Southwest Airlines really, really hates the EU - and he's not afraid to tell the 
EU precisely where they can stick their regulations and hauteur, J.P. Freire notes at the American Spectator:
Here is a transcript of the first few minutes of O'Leary's John Galt speech (video below):This is the first time I think 
that I or RyanAir have ever been invited to a conference by the European Union. Because as most of you know, the 
European Union spends most of its time suing me, torturing me, criticizing me or condeming me for lowering the 
cost of air travel all over Europe and making life so really difficult for their favorite airlines, which as we all know like 
high-fare airlines, like Air France, British Airlines, and Lufthansa who must be protected at all costs because they're 
the future of Europe - the future of europe lies in people being forced to pay 800 euros for one-hour flights across 
the continent; the future of Europe lies in people being forced to pay fuel surcharges for the right to travel on 
Europe's best airlines run by the Germans, the French, and the British.
As Freire writes, "For this speech to come from someone in Europe, let alone at a summit at the EU, is a 
conservative dream." Watch the whole thing - or at least the first three or four minutes; the equivalent of Rick 
Santelli's now legendary tea de coeur in early 2009.

Michael O'Leary, the CEO of discount airline Ryanair, is a familiar part of the company's brand: the carrier offers 
cheap 'n' cheerful flights with none of the fancy stuff you might find on Virgin or British Airways.
The downside is that Ryanair has a celebrated reputation for rooking its passengers any way it can, such as 
charging a $56 fee for printing boarding passes, charging booking fees for using credit cards, and even advertising 
non-existent flights.
Likewise, O'Leary also has a reputation for ruthless.
He's used the F-word at journalists, required his chauffeur to drive in the bus lane to avoid traffic, said that 
"business books are bullshit and are usually written by wankers," and been accused of telling lies in court.
He's also not afraid to put on a show. To promote his routes, he has dressed variously as St Patrick, a French 
chambermaid and a Roman centurion. He also once promised business class passengers "beds and blowjobs." 
(The image above, for instance, was taken Nov. 24 at a press conference in Brussels to reveal new destinations 
and options for passengers.)
Once you know all that, the following images of O'Leary pulling faces and clowning around will come as no surprise. 
This just isn't normal CEO behavior.
They were all taken at his own press events.
At a Jan.26, 2010, press conference on new Italian routes, held in Milan, Italy.
April 9, 2003: Announcing a 10 euro fare from Berlin-Schoenefeld to London-Stansted.

As a rule of thumb, advertisers try not to associate their products with ruthless communist dictators who control 
hermit kingdoms with iron fists.
But rules are made to be broken, and ad agencies love breaking them. Jong-Il -- or at least his image, which 
advertisers weren't afraid to borrow -- featured in campaigns for everything from games for the XBox360 to the 
Coco de Mer chain of sex shops, with varying degrees of success.
The ad featuring Jong-il reviewing Call of Duty 4 -- "very fun game, American scum!" is hilarious. A South African 
dairy's pun on the phrase "bad eggs" ... not so.
Here's a look at a few of them.

Is it being hit in the face with pepper spray sexy? It is, admittedly, a question you didn't know you needed an 
answer to.
Nonetheless, advertising/editorial photographer Tyler Shields has attempted a solution. His latest project features 
two models, allegedly wearing American Apparel underwear, giving a bunch of police officers a taste of their own 
medicine.
Shot in London, Shields' role reversal features models Francesca Eastwood and long time collaborator Alessandra 
Torressani. He claims he used real pepper spray:
"This was just about as crazy as it looks and yes we used real pepper spray which is no joke. Trust me you do not 
want to be sprayed in the face!"
The project has a worthy underlying message about bullying and standing up for what you believe in ... which is 
only somewhat clouded by the hot babes in heels.
For reference, that's the original image up top of the pepper spray cop casually dousing Occupy U.C. Davis 
protesters back in November.
Now here's Shields' reinterpretation:

Looks as though Ryanair is continuing its vaunted legacy of sensitivity and deference toward women.
About a month ago, I assembled a compendium of awfulness that has defined airline Ryanair's gender relations 
(and customer relations, for that matter) over the last, oh, forever.
The fact that Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary personally selects female employees for a yearly Cabin Crew Charity 
(lingerie) Calendar doesn't help. Nor does the fact that he once manhandled his barely-dressed 'honorees' for a 
promotional video for the calendar:
http://www.youtube.com/embed/guSk8s2AGww?feature=player_embedded
Anyway. I digress.
Turns out that O'Leary is in a bit of hot water (again!) over some ads that Ryanair released for said calendar, 
according to the Guardian. And what's so bad about this advertisement, which features an actual Ryanair employee 
pinup? This is what's so bad:
Yikes. And the ad has generated so much controversy that, according to Guardian, the Advertising Standard 
Authority has launched an inquiry after receiving complains that "the ads are 'sexist and objectify women, 
particularly female cabin crew.'"
This naturally begs the question, How much inquiring does it take to determine sexism? We'd think (particularly 
given the visual medium) this would be one of those 'snap judgment' things. Particularly when the Ryanair 
spokesperson somehow manages to be this smarmy (via Guardian:
A spokesperson for Ryanair said that it has been running the charity calendar for five years and that it would 
"continue to support the right of our crew to take their clothes off to raise money for those who need it most".
Ick.

Nearly 10,000 people have signed a petition asking Ryanair to drop its annual calendar featuring pictures of its 
female flight attendants posing in lingerie. The protest, on Change.org, was started by someone who identifies 
herself as Ghada, a flight attendant, and reads in part:
"Safety is our number one priority, not theçbrand of our underwear."
Ryanair is also using images from its calendar in its current advertising. The image at right is of "Gillian," from the 
month of March.
Ryanair is unrepentant. Michael O'Leary, CEO of the discount air carrier, famously cares little for the opinions of his 
customers or staff. The company told the Daily Mail that the calendar was being sold to raise money for a charity 
that aids children with the skin condition EB (epidermolysis bullosa):
"We will continue to support the right of our crew to take their clothes off to raise money for those who need it 
most."
There is a counter-petition, also on Change.org, for people who support Ryanair's calendar. Only one person has 
signed on to it so far.
To prove this isn't a bunch of sexist nonsense -- and you can take that with a grain of salt -- O'Leary also posed in 
his underwear at the calendar's launch in November. It wasn't pretty.

Thanks to some mind-numbingly stupid creative investments in their indigenous property market during the housing 
bubble, some of Irelands richest fell the hardest when that bubble burst. Okay, so maybe not the richest, but 
certainly the most indulgent. Now those very same folks are attempting to offload their personalized properties with 
little luck. One need not get inside the gates of this $3.6M estate to understand that this is one uniquely heinous 
renovation of an Irish classic from 1798. That's because the gates themselves are crafted to look like a dragon 
preparing to strike. Inside, things don't get much better, with a Tim Burton meets Spiderman aesthetic that would 
have a hard time finding a buyer were it next door to Marvel Comics headquarters, never mind on the outskirts of 
Dublin. The only saving grace is that the stately facade doesn't seem to have been significantly altered during the 
seven year renovation that created this abomination. Plus, with so many other fine estates on the market in Ireland, 
we doubt this one will sell anytime soon.
Click here to view the full photogallery.
  In it's facade and grounds, this Georgian stone manor, known as Jamestown Court, is just as described, "a truly 
historic estate," but head inside and one finds it has fallen victim to some dastardly design choices. Red velvet 
coats the walls of the master bedroom and a sitting room, the master bath has been tiled, floor to ceiling, in a 
hideous brown marble, and cheap-looking furnishings and artwork populate nearly every room. Still, for 62 acres 
and a stone shell from 1720, the asking price of $3.7M isn't exorbitant. 
Click here to view the full photogallery.
  Thanks to a little bit of Irish luck, there are a few notable estates that haven't been retrofitted with terrible interiors. 
This, the 1785 Mount Kennedy House, is one such classic home. Resting on 169 acres of rolling emerald 
countryside-complete with a herd of sheep-this "classical Georgian mansion" has rooms that can be accurately 
described as baronal, and most retain their 226-year-old details. The price for this seven-bedroom, four-bath 
Kennedy compound is available upon request.
Globe Trotting: Irish Estates Left Behind When the Property Market Crashed
Click here to view the full photogallery.
  Lyons Demesne, the estate of the late Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, is perhaps the most spectacular of the many 
Irish estates on the market today. It's no surprise then, that it's also probably the most expensive. When it first went 
to market in 2009, the place was asking around $100M. A year later, the price was slashed down to $65M in hopes 
of a quick sale. A buyer never showed and now the price reads "Available Upon Request," otherwise known as "as 
much as we can get." The late Mr. Ryan is said to have spent upwards of $120M restoring the property to its 18th-
century glory, too bad that glory can't fetch a 21st-century buyer.
Click here to view the full photogallery.
  Finally, here's an Irish country home with a more reasonable price tag and tolerable interiors. Located 10 miles 
south of the Dublin city center, this 19th-century stucco manse might have some bold colors on the walls, but at 
least there isn't a dragon guarding the gate. The five-bedroom spread sits on a comfortable four-acre lot and is 
distinguished more by its restraint than by any risky interior design. At $2.5M, the most sensible home on this list is 
also, thankfully, the least expensive.

New York, November 30th (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) ended the 
trading 
session higher by $0.45 or 1.54% from its previous close. Ryanair's price action formed what is considered to be a
bullish engulfing candle that could very well signal continuation of trend or reversal on ongoing weakness.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's recent stock range has been formed by a trough where calculated support was defined at $28.48 and by 
a peak that established the 
resistance level at $30.17, which could be used by traders planning their trades.
Traders wanting to establish a position in Ryanair or traders that are already holding the stock can use the bullish 
engulfing pattern to their advantage. The pattern provides a defined risk as it shows where the 
bears were able to push the stock down, before the bulls stepped in.
The bullish engulfing pattern is a leading indicator that provides an alert to the bulls that
the trend will continue or that there is an immediate reversal to the short term weakness seen on the stock. Below

Baggage handlers from Liverpool John Lennon Airport have recently staged a strike over job cuts.
The ground staff walked out of their jobs in a two-hour protest over proposed job losses in the North West and they 
formed a picket line in front of the terminal waving placards and flags. It was the second protest in a 24 hour period 
that the demonstrators voiced their anger at the announced plans for 47 compulsory redundancies by Servisair. The 
firm deals with airlines including Ryanair and FlyBe.
All of the activists were members of the GMB union, the general trade union for the UK. Eddie Parker, GMB official, 
said: "Servisair initially put 75 jobs at risk from redundancy.
"Given the level of unemployment on Merseyside and given that Servisair is making a profit, compulsory 
redundancies are not acceptable."
A spokesman for Liverpool John Lennon Airport has said that passengers whose airlines use the aircraft ground 
handling company can expect to be able to fly without disturbance during the row and the firm has promised there 
will be no disruption to flights.
Although a number of staff have continued to work despite the plans for industrial action, ensure that the travels and 
holiday is unaffected by using ship baggage services instead.
Robinsons1stopship offers door to door international shipping from as little as £99, so contact them today to avoid 
any baggage handling strikes and the costly baggage fees. All belongings are securely packaged and loaded with

Bloomberg Terminals are the information lifeblood of the financial industry.
Among other functions, they provide breaking news and collect articles from all over that are relevant to trading.
But Bloomberg also collects what they call "Odd" news; basically, that includes everything not relevant to markets. 
Today, for example, that included stories on astronauts, the grossest parts of the mall, and the world's biggest pork 
taco.
But traders and bankers don't seem to find those stories very compelling. When they click on non-finance articles, 
it's usually because there's some nudity involved.
The evidence: we've collected the top ten most-read Bloomberg Terminal news in the Odd category for the last 
month.
"Highwood believes it smashes pumpkin record"
The tenth-most popular non-finance article was a Comtex writeup of this story about a Chicago-area town's effort to 
break a Guiness World Record by lighting 32,000 jack-o'-lanterns.
An innocent beginning.

IN A rare show of unity, four airlines wrote to Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, yesterday to 
request the scrapping of Air Passenger Duty (APD). APD is the tax charged on every passenger, except those on 
transfers, flying out of Britain on a plane seating more than 20, and the chief executives of IAG (the holding 
company of British Airways and Iberia), Virgin Atlantic, Ryanair and easyJet claim it is "threatening the 
competitiveness of the UK and is stifling growth".
Sensing, perhaps, that the tax won't be scrapped any time soon, they give Mr Osborne a second, interim request: 
the establishment of an independent enquiry to look into the effects APD is having on Britain's economic 
performance. A similar study performed in Holland after the introduction of a travel tax there in 2008 impelled the 
Dutch government to axe the tax altogether.
The letter would benefit from dropping some of its more emotive language, such as the "hard-working families" 
being taxed for taking a "well-earned holiday", but the airline bosses can be excused a show of emotion. They point 
out that passenger numbers at Britain's APD-hit airports have dropped for the last three years, yet grew by 66m in 
European airports in 2010.
APD was introduced in 1994 as an environmental tax, and it didn't stop passenger numbers in Britain rising every 
year until 2007. But the tax didn't seem to impinge strongly on consumer behaviour until the end of 2010, when 
passengers heading to the US had to start paying £60 ($94) each in economy class; those flying in business class 
to Singapore had to hand over £170. With passengers also due to start paying an Emissions Trading Scheme tax in 
the new year on flights into and out of the European Union, all European airlines face an uncertain few months. 
Thanks in part to the APD effect, those whose business is concentrated in Britain have even more to worry about.

The UK's top family brand 2011? That's Marks & Spencer, which has knocked Boots off the top spot, according to 
the FamilyBrands report from Isobel and YouGov, writes Maria Stadtmueller. And Ryanair has been voted one of 
the worst family brands, while giant retailer Tesco has slipped out of the top 20 for the first time.
Facebook is making little impression on the family, sitting in 59th place, down from 43rd last year - just 2% of those 
surveyed cite the social media brand as 'promoting and supporting family values'.
"It will come as no surprise to many that Facebook has fallen down the rankings, given the recent consumer 
backlash against unwelcome revamps and growing privacy concerns," says Amber Faulkner, digital integration 
director, Isobel.
"Whilst most of us joined the social behemoth to connect with family and friends, reports of misuse of data, a lack of 
communication regarding changes to the site and a steady infiltration of brands using it as a marketing channel 
mean that, for many, Facebook is losing its original purpose - the user feels like they are being used."

Lufthansa unveils aggressive expansion plan for Berlin

German airline Lufthansa plans to boost passenger services to and from Berlin when the city's new international 
airport opens next year. It will also cut ticket prices in a bid to beat low-cost rivals at their own game.German airline 
Lufthansa has unveiled an ambitious new Berlin strategy to coincide with the opening of the capital's new 
international airport in June 2012. 
The plans include expanding its fleet and passenger facilities, flying new routes and knocking down ticket prices 
amid fierce competition from no-frills airlines. The new airport, Berlin Brandenburg International, will be Germany's 
third-largest once it opens its doors next year.
"We're going to expand our presence in a manner that we've never done before," Carsten Spohr, head of 
Lufthansa's passenger services, said at a press conference in Berlin on Wednesday. 
"We're banking on Berlin and are committed to grow at an above average rate here."
New destinations, new planes 
Those growth plans include boosting the carrier's Berlin fleet. The number of planes based in the city will rise to 15 
from 9, increasing passenger capacity by over 40 percent. Lufthansa says it will introduce a more flexible flight plan 
and operate more sophisticated Airbus jets for Berlin.
There are plans to create 4,000 new jobs in Berlin and the neighboring state of Brandenburg. The airline is hiring 
130 new pilots and 200 flight crew members. The company's overall investment in Berlin is estimated at 60 million 
euros.
 Lufthansa also plans to fly to 38 destinations from Berlin in the future, instead of the current eight. The new non-
stop services - which will fly to cities such as Valencia, Bologna, Birmingham, Istanbul and Barcelona - are seen as 
an attempt to capitalize on the soaring numbers of tourists flocking to the German capital.
The move is likely to increase pressure on Lufthansa's budget rivals. In addition to domestic player Air Berlin, the 
German capital is serviced by a number of no-frills carriers including Easyjet, Norwegian and Ryanair.
Lufthansa unveils aggressive expansion plan for Berlin
"There's certainly room for another big carrier in booming Berlin," German aviation analyst Heinrich Großbongardt 
told Deutsche Welle. "The city's catchment area is also increasingly attractive for international business so it's the 
right move for Lufthansa."
Tickets starting at 49 euros 
The expansion measures in Berlin, Lufthansa says, will help make its short-and medium-haul traffic profitable. 
Some analysts estimate that Lufthansa has been losing around 100 million euros each year on those routes even 
though the carrier has been turning a profit on its international flights. 
Lufthansa also announced it plans to offer one-way tickets from Berlin to destinations in Europe starting at 49 euros 
- a first for the airline and a direct challenge to budget airlines that have been offering discount prices for years.
"This is a major step for Lufthansa, which has lost passengers to low-cost carriers because of its inflexible ticketing 
so far," independent airline industry analyst Cord Schellenberger told Deutsche Welle. 
"It may be a late move but Lufthansa has finally learned the right lessons from low-carriers who know how to make 
money on short-haul flights."
Targeting Air Berlin?
But some analysts are skeptical that the new strategy will really help turn around Lufthansa's European continental 
traffic.
Großbongardt said Lufthansa's aim of keeping unit costs at the new Berlin airport one third below average costs 
across its domestic and European network was unrealistic unless it tackled high labor costs, he said. 
Instead, Großbongardt said, Lufthansa's expansion plans in Berlin looked more like a direct attack on its main 
domestic rival, Air Berlin which has traditionally been the dominant airline in Germany's capital.
Air Berlin has been floundering in the red in recent years and has been forced into a cost-cutting program and fleet 
reductions.
 "The plans are a clear attempt to push Air Berlin over the brink," Großbongardt said. "Air Berlin may be struggling 
but it's still a tough competitor to Lufthansa on German and European routes. Lufthansa would certainly benefit 
from Air Berlin disappearing from the market."
Berlin to LA 
But for all its firepower, Lufthansa has, for now at least, been trumped by Air Berlin when it comes to operating long-
haul international flights from the German capital.
Air Berlin plans to fly to 70 destinations from Berlin non-stop starting next summer. The airline already operates 
flights to New York, Miami, Dubai and Bangkok. Next May, it's set to add another destination to its list - Los 
Angeles.
Lufthansa has said it has no plans to offer long-haul services before 2013, preferring to concentrate on bolstering its 
European business.

Perhaps inspired by the latest release of its spicy cabin crew calendar, CEO of Irish budget carrier Ryanair, Michael 
O'Leary is talking about launching a service where passengers can watch porn on flights, according to The Sun (via 
Gawker).
The dirty scenes won't be available to view on screens on the back of seats, assures O'Leary, the X-rated 
entertainment would only be downloadable through an inflight-app for iPads and smartphones.
Click here to see all the crazy things Ryanair has done to keep flights super cheap > 
Unfortunately, excited passengers will have to wait at least a year before they can even think about purchasing 
raunchy scenes on their handheld devices. The airline is still not sure whether it will be able to secure powerful 
enough broadband connections or if there is a market for porn on planes, reportsThe Sun.
Of course, Ryanair's famously charismatic boss is known for pushing the limits of air travel when it comes to 
keeping fares low. 
And travelers are willing to play along if it means cheap tickets. 
In September 2011, Ryanair reported a 6 percent climb in passenger traffic, increasing to 7.25 million from 6.84 
million the previous year.
O'Leary's cost-cutting measures may not always get the greenlight - and are often the subject of controversy - but 
the company's innovative milieu is something to admire. 
Introducing standing-room-only seating 
In July 2010, Ryanair introduced plans to charge passengers £4 (about $6) for standing-room-only seats.
The proposal involved removing the back 10 rows of seats from the airline's 250 planes and replacing them with 15 
rows of vertical seats. 
Ryanair 's Latest Money-Making Scheme: Screening Porn On Planes (RYAAY)
Ryanair claimed to be shopping the idea to Boeing, but the jetmaker wasn't too fond of bypassing European safety 
regulations to help customers save a few pennies. 
Asking overweight passengers to pay more
In 2009, Ryanair proposed a "fat tax" for overweight passengers after one-third of travelers voted in favor of the 
extra charge in an online poll conducted by the Irish carrier, according to The Guardian. 
One month later, the airline said it was dumping the contentious tactic because there was no way to collect the 
money without causing delays. 
Charging customers to use the toilet
In 2009, Ryanair considered charging passengers £1 (about $1.40) to use the toilets on board.
CEO Michael O'Leary told the BBC:
One thing we have looked at in the past, and are looking at again, is the possibility of maybe putting a coin slot on 
the toilet door, so that people might actually have to spend a pound to spend a penny in future. 
In 2011, the airline confirmed it was dropping the coin-operated scheme in favor of another controversial plan.

Ryanair has long struggled with a bit of an image problem. It is notoriously unpopular among fliers, earning the title 
of "least favorite airline" - likely due in no small part to CEO Michael O'Leary's seemingly stingy attitude toward 
passengers. You want examples? Right this way.
He's long pushed to install pay-for-use toilets on his planes - and once proposed removing toilets in order to cram 
more passengers on flights. And, so long as we're on the subject, O'Leary also tried to get a standing-room fare 
installed for flights, in a bid to make turbulence all that much more terrifying, one would suppose.
You want more? You got it.
Ryanair was caught in another customer-relations kerfuffle last year when a passenger claimed she wasn't allowed 
to board because the ink on her ticket wasn't dark enough. Around the same time, O'Leary settled a defamation 
case with the head of the Airline Pilots Association, after reportedly referring to him as a "failed Aer Lingus pilot" on 
national T.V.
A group of passengers once accused Ryanair of abandoning them on the wrong Canary Island. The Irish 
Paralympian table tennis team said it was left in flux last year after Ryanair reportedly "refused to allow more than 
four wheelchair passengers to travel at any one time," according to the Belfast Telegraph.
We could do this all day. Bottom line: Ryanair got problems. But, as we learned after the President of France 
reportedly took legal action against the airline for a series of ads that featured an unauthorized photo of Carla Bruni, 
Ryanair doesn't give two hoots about its image.
Which brings us to this: the launch of Ryanair's 2012 Cabin Crew Charity Calendar, which I guess women actually 
try out for, or something. And if you win you get to pose in your skivvies for a calendar. Yay. Here's a video from 
last year's launch, to give you a quick idea how this all goes down.

Over the weekend I was near-convinced I'd found the sketchiest CEO ever. A long-time connoisseur of Ryanair's 
horrendous hijinks, I was only marginally surprised when a video emerged of CEO Michael O'Leary manhandling 
some of his bikini-clad employees for a charity calendar, whilst grinning like a Red Bull-fueled madman. This had to 
be it, the Holy Grail of gross bosses - and the accompanying photos of him hugging Ryanair stewardesses in their 
undies confirmed as much, I thought.
But, oh, I was wrong.
After releasing his initial "does it even need to be said"-level of horrible ads, Ashley Madison CEO Noel Biderman 
has topped himself.
For the blissfully unfamiliar, here's some background on Biderman and what he does. Biderman is the married 
entrepreneur behind Ashley Madison, a site designed for married individuals looking to cheat on their spouses. He's 
famously said that monogamy is "a failed experiment," despite the fact that (as I mentioned before) he's married. 
His site purportedly helps unhappy marrieds meet other unhappy marrieds.
And that brings us back to his ads. Biderman is notorious for them. The most famous is from way earlier this year - 
it's a T.V. spot that was slashed from the Super Bowl, in which an initially distraught, cuckolded wife embraces the 
willful freedom that comes with realizing that her spouse is cheating on her. She's sad - but also liberated! Now she 
leers at her coworkers, and thrills at the possibilities that her husband's asshattery has afforded her. It's the "no 
means yes" of digital adultery.
Now, I realize that getting persnickety over ads from an adultery website is kind of like criticizing the Fast and the 
Furious movies because they promote unsafe driving. But the latest set of ads from Biderman underscores his total 
hypocrisy.
The first one was released around Halloween and the second released today - we found both images via Jezebel. 
Both imply that finding a woman of a 'physical ideal' is justification for cheating on your wife. You can see the 
Adultery Website CEO Releases (Yet Another) Offensive Ad, Is Definitely the Sketchiest Ever
second one to the left, to give you an idea. (Just an FYI, Jezebel tracked down the woman in the so-called "scary" 
ad and she's none too pleased with how her image is being used.)
The ads - the second one, in particular - completely invalidate Biderman's core defense of his business: that 
adultery is healthy and good for a marriage (and both men and women), particularly after the fire dies down. 
Despite being cruel and mean, it also calls women out in particular. The woman in the ads is no longer considered 
"good enough." So it's time to cheat on her. And the fact that he's releasing ad after ad in this vein is grating and 
tired. 
Given the sheer volume of ads in the Ashley Madison canon, it's impossible to say for sure whether another exists 
that puts men up to the same scrutiny. But, as far as I can tell, there's no ad available that aims to shame a guy - no 
ad featuring a larger gentleman with a come hither look, whom we're supposed to mock. It's not monogamy that 
Biderman sees as a failure - it's women.
But is he the grossest CEO yet? We're learning not to hold our breath.

Irish airline Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary is looking to make flying with his company just a little more enjoyable. To 
that end, he's looking to provide a smartphone and tablet app for passengers that would grant them access to 
entertainment options, including some controversial additions like video games and gambling. Also porn. Did we 
mention the porn? He wants to charge passengers for watching pornography on his planes.
Of course, there are some major obstacles. First, he'll have to overcome potential backlash from people who are 
understandably upset with the idea of people watching pornography in such proximety to children, or themselves. 
To his critics, the Daily Mail quotes O'Leary as saying:
"I'm not talking about having it on screens on the back of seats for everyone to see. It would be on handheld 
devices. [...] Hotels around the world have it, so why wouldn't we?"
Why indeed?
Besides the ick-factor of his plan, there are also some technical issues to overcome. Namely, finding a way to 
maintain a strong broadband connection with the plane while in flight. After all, if you have a lot of people streaming 
steamy content, it's going to take a lot of bandwidth. Also, it's probably a fair assumption that the kind of person who 
would watch pornography on a plane probably already has pornography loaded onto his or her (but let's be honest, 
"his") mobile device. So, a certain premium quality to the content will likely be necessary.
Now, while everyone has a right to watch whatever they want, doing so in an enclosed space miles above the 
ground is going to be problematic. You may be fine with going to a porno theater, but that doesn't really make it fair 
for you to drag everyone else to one as well. If you need more proof that this is a half-baked scheme, here's the 
Daily Mail's commentary on some of O'Leary's other plans to monetize the airline:
Last month he said he was looking at removing all but one toilet from his planes to put in extra seats. While he has 
previously proposed charging passengers for using the toilet in-flight.

Say what you want about Kim Kardashian, the socialite certainly sets the trends. No sooner did she announce her 
quickfire separation than Filene's, a firm founded in 1881 and famous for its Running of the Brides, similarly called it 
quits. And rounding out an ominous week in equities, Europe came closer than ever before to concluding its Big Fat 
Greek Wedding is destined to end in divorce and the drachma. (To be fair the news wasn't all bad - Estée Lauder 
(EL), whose advertising always does its best to promote matrimonial bliss, surged some 16.30% in five sessions.) 
Ongoing economic angst across the Atlantic and a fuzzy final communiqué - precisely the sort of $10 word the 
continent can't afford - from the Group of 20 in France sent shares down for the first week in six, the S&P 500 Index 
sliding 2.48% to take it back into the red for 2011. While Athens is reduced to panhandling with a humble coffee cup 
- presumably the iconic Gotham version invented by the exquisitely named Mr. Buck - upscale Starbucks (SBUX) 
fared far better. Its 6.74% earnings-related increase on Friday sent shares to their highest level in history. Doubtless 
delighting the Occupy Wall Street crowd, who photographic evidence indicates can easily afford expensive lattes, 
the better to be wide awake while marching on Sleepless Seattle.
Elsewhere the jobless rate unexpectedly ticked down to 9.0% in October, John Corzine newly unemployed even as 
Kate Gosselin finally found productive work. And upstate New York still can't catch a break. Rochester's own 
Eastman Kodak (EK), whose stock has now shed 75.98% in a year, announced a $222 million quarterly loss. The 
company has long been a proponent of a 13-month year but time alas waits for no man and it finally ran out on 
Albany born man of the hour Andy Rooney. Today in economics, September consumer credit is out at 3:00 p.m. 
Eastern. Another busy week in third quarter earnings kicks off with Babcock & Wilcox (BWC), Dish Network (DISH),

(RYAAY), Sysco (SYY), and WMS Industries (WMS) all due to report results.

YOU MAY have heard that Ryanair, the Irish low-cost airline, recently used "duct tape" to repair an aeroplane 
windshield. It's a great story, combining fear of flying, anxiety about low-cost products, and the legend of duct tape 
being able to repair just about anything. British and American tabloids certainly made the most of the story. But it's 
not true, says Patrick Smith, the author of Salon's "Ask the Pilot" column [emphasis added]:
Say what you want about Ryanair overall - this is a carrier known to push the boundaries of "low-cost carrier" into 
ever more controversial directions - but this is another one of those things that looks a lot worse than it is.
For starters, there was no duct tape. The mechanics had applied a heavy-duty aluminum bonding tape known as 
"speed tape." Embarrassing as it might appear, superficial or noncritical components are routinely patched with this 
material. It's a temporary fix, until more substantive repairs are made later on. The tape is extremely durable and is 
able to expand and contract through a wide range of temperatures.
"We never use, and don't even stock, duct tape," says Charlie (last name withheld), a veteran airline mechanic with 
22 years experience on Boeings. "Some of the tapes we use cost hundreds, even thousands, of dollars per roll. 
Speed tape is one of those. Last I heard, it costs about $700 per 4-inch-wide roll. It's approved by the manufacturer, 
FAA and company engineering department for certain repairs ... always temporary."
This was a cosmetic application; the tape was used to keep uncured sealant in place; by no stretch was it "holding 
the window in" or any such claim. The taped section was not a stressed area of the windscreen or frame.
Now you know. So why did the Ryanair pilots turn the plane around and head back to Stansted airport a little over 
20 minutes into the flight? Mr Smith's buddy Charlie had an answer for that, too: there could have been a "small 
pressurization leak" (something Mr Smith explains is mostly a "nuisance" problem), or some of the tape could have 
"peeled away", creating an unpleasant noise. Either way, there was never any real danger. The tape wasn't actually 
holding the window in or anything like that; the actual pressure seal is further inside the airframe.
Anyway, read Mr Smith's whole column for the full story, and don't worry: they're not duct-taping your plane.

Younger workers are far more eager than their older counterparts to ditch their current jobs, according a new report 
from global HR consulting firm Mercer.
Click here to see the charts > 
Surprisingly, those same young workers - aged 16 to 34, with a special emphasis on the 16-to-24 group - are also 
significantly happier at their gigs. Many of them would even recommend their employers to job seekers more often 
than their older colleagues would.
And this is a global phenomenon - the data spans 30,000 workers from 17 countries on four continents.
Maybe it's that today's younger workers more commonly want to try out a series of jobs before settling on a single 
career trajectory, or that older workers have been at it long enough to be bored and jaded. Either way, employers 
better get a handle on their happiest (and probably hardest-working) employees to keep them around.
Australian and Argentinian workers are most likely to jump ship
Young Italian workers are more than three times as happy with their employers as the average worker
Young French workers are more than three times as satisfied with their jobs as the average worker

Russia 's Experiment With Budget Airlines Fails Miserably
Russia's Experiment With Budget Airlines Fails Miserably

The bankruptcy of Russia's last two low cost carriers, Avianova and Sky Express, in the past month has brought an 
end to the short era of budget flights in Russia.
On November 1, federal air transport agency Rosaviatsia suspended Sky Express' licence, citing weak financial 
and operational results as the reason.
Now the carrier is about to be taken over by oligarch Oleg Deripaska's Kuban Airlines. Talks between the two 
companies started last summer after Sky Express' debts to its home airport Vnukovo had topped nearly RUB2bn 
((EURO)47.5m) as of April.
Sky Express was set up in March 2006 by KrasAir CEO Boris Abramov, the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD) and others as the first attempt to introduce a low-cost carrier that would cater to Russia's 
holiday-mad population.
Its maiden flight was on January 29, 2007 from Moscow to the popular Black Sea resort of Sochi. But on October 
29, just 20 days after its low-cost rival Avianova ceased operations, Sky Express also grounded its fleet for good.
"It's really hard for a small, low-cost company with small capital to survive," says Sergei Babichenko, head of the 
press office of BasEl, the holding company that owns Kuban Air. "Sky Express started to sink in 2008 with the 
beginning of the global financial crisis. Company debts were growing, planes stayed idle. Our shareholders decided 
to save the business and staff, which was almost a charitable act. This company could not operate on its own."
Cheap tickets should have been a winner in Russia where domestic flights are often more expensive than those to 
European destinations. Avianova managed to transport 2.5m people in two years and climbed to an impressive 
sixth position among Russian domestic passenger carriers. But intense passenger traffic didn't translate into profits. 
Avianova gave up the ghost on October 9 and began to pay compensation to more than 60,000 ticketholders 
booked on flights after this date. 
Monopoly in the making 
Russia 's Experiment With Budget Airlines Fails Miserably
What mainly contributed to Avianova's demise was very high fuel prices. Kerosene supply is a monopoly market 
and the price continues to rise, but the issue has been ignored by Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS).
The other big reason for Avianova's failure was the impact of inefficient ground maintenance at airports, which 
reduced the number of miles a year the company's fleet could fly. Even the international hub of Moscow can't 
compete with western standards, let alone Russia's regional airports. 
Avianova deputy CEO Konstantin Teterin blames existing legislation. "In Russia, the low-cost business model in its 
classic realisation, like Ryanair or Southwest, is impossible. Regional airports can't offer any special conditions for 
low-cost companies, there are no secondary hubs [and] taxes for planes with passenger capacity of 180 seats, 
which is ideal for a low-cost company, are very high.
Avianova's experience showed huge demand for cheap tickets. I think if the government admits low-cost companies 
are needed, new airlines with a hybrid business model, like AirBaltic, EasyJet, may appear." 
The upshot is that the current conditions on the Russian aviation market make it impossible for low-cost airlines to 
operate without government support. Yet moves by the regulator make it clear that the government's strategy is to 
increase the monopolisation of the sector. 
Moscow airports Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo are ready to merge, and the national carrier Aeroflot will get 
preferential treatment, while smaller companies will in effect be pushed out of the market. "The aviation sector does 
need consolidation to make it more profitable in general and also more safe," admits Alfa Bank analyst Yuly 
Matevosov. "There is the same tendency in other sectors - government wants to clean them up from minor players 
and make them more transparent." 
The real war against small airlines started in September after President Dmitry Medvedev said the nation's aging 
fleet was becoming unsafe and should be scrapped. As if to prove his point, Russia suffered from a string of 
catastrophic air crashes, culminating in the crash of a Yak-42 that went down in Yaroslavl in September, killing most 
of the much-loved Lokomotiv Yaroslavl ice hockey team. 
The government reacted quickly, proposing changes in legislation to improve safety: from 2012, all planes must be 
equipped with the crash prevention system (which is absent on most airliners now) and companies with fleets of 
less than 10 airplanes are forbidden to offer regular flights. The transport ministry also announced it will suspend 
the company licence if the number of flights with two-hour delays exceed 10% of all flights in a season. 
However, a result of the new rules will be to reinforce Aeroflot's monopoly, as well as help second biggest Russian 
airline Transaero. Tellingly, both said they're not worried with the new legislation. 
On October 26, Aeroflot deputy CEO Shamil Kurmashov claimed the company's market share would grow to 36.6% 
by the end of 2015. Considering many competitors will have to leave the market after new the regulations come into 
force, Aeroflot's ambition is well within its reach, says Investcafe analyst Kirill Markin. 
Alfa's Matevosov reckons Russia won't seen any new low-cost carrier for a couple of years; the aviation sector 
requires long-term investments and there is no big investor interested in creating an independent low-cost company 
right now. More likely, he says, one of the leading airlines will start its own low-cost daughter company.
However, Kurmashov says Aeroflot has no plans to create a budget daughter company in the foreseeable future, 
explaining that under current conditions it's simply impossible. For example, he notes, airport taxes for low-cost 
airlines are the same as for "traditional" companies. 
So the niche is empty now with no signs of any of the big domestic airlines ready to fill it, especially as they can now 
snap up the losers' local routes, pilots, planes and customers. Further, foreign companies are banned from the 
Russian market and that's not going to change anytime soon.

BA in BMI bid.
International Airlines Group, parent company of British Airways and Iberia, announced Friday that it has reached an 
agreement to buy British Midlands airline (BMI) from its parent company, Lufthansa. The sale, which is expected to 
be complete by the first quarter of 2012, will successfully rid the German company of the money-losing airline and 
gain BA coveted slots at cramped Heathrow Airport, which is currently operating at full capacity after axing plans for 
a third runway. Financial details of the deal are still unclear, but according to Reuters, analysts are putting the value 
at around £300 million.
The news, however, hasn't done much for IAG's stock, which lost nearly 4 percent on the news, The Press 
Association reported, putting it at the bottom of the FTSE index. IAG's purchase is widely being seen as a bid to 
increase its capacity at Heathrow in an effort to encourage growth after its sharp decline in third-quarter profits this 
year, driven down by higher fuel costs.
Bet-makers Paddy Power knows a trend when it sees one, which is why it's now taking bets on which airline will be 
the next to fall into IAG's hands. LAN Airlines is the 4/1 favourite, with Swiss International Airlines at 6/1, EasyJet at 
a distant 25/1 and RyanAir at 100/1.
Heathrow monopoly? This deal will, The Economist's Gulliver blog said, tighten the grip BA and its OneWorld 
Alliance partners have on London's biggest airport and reduce competition for flights between London and North 
America. BMI is currently the second largest carrier at Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport, and, as the blog noted, 
"If IAG were allowed to keep all of BMI's takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow, its share of these would rise from 
about 45 percent to 53 percent." BA Chief Willie Walsh, speaking to BBC Radio Friday morning, said that this would 
be a smaller percentage of slots than Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners have at Frankfurt, or Air France and 
its Sky Team buddies have at Paris Charles de Gaulle. "True, but two near-monopolies do not justify a third," the 
blog judged; Britain's Competition Commission might agree and force IAG to sell off some of BMI's slots.
Virgin, flyers lose out. Virgin, The Economist noted, is one of the major losers in this deal: The airline "had also 
expressed an interest, hoping to integrate BMI's short- and medium-haul routes in Europe, the Middle East and 
Africa with its own transatlantic routes to form a strong, Heathrow-based hub-and-spoke network" and now, sees its 
BA parent company IAG gobbles up BMI, snags more Heathrow slots for BA
rival sliding in to the Heathrow spot. Travelers may also find themselves lacking in choices for airlines departing 
from Heathrow after the purchase; but more than that, The Economist noted, IAG's deal is part of a larger trend of 
big airlines buying up smaller ones or flying subsidiaries, which can't be good for competition. USA Today's 
Boarding Area blog worried, too, that BMI flyers might be getting shafted: "[I]f you have a stockpile of miles, I'd get 
burning. Now."
Asia, here we come. BA and IAG haven't exactly had boom years in the last few, so why would a flagging airline 
want to buy another flagging airline? IAG Chief Walsh told reporters following the deal, "It is clear that bmi in its 
current form is unsustainable but we're confident we can make a success of it.... We will particularly look to expand 
BA's long-haul network ... it will allow us to connect Heathrow and the UK to emerging markets, particularly in Asia 
and Latin America."

Michael O'Leary, the famously charismatic CEO of Irish budget airline Ryanair, is known for pushing the limits of air 
travel when it comes to keeping fares low. 
And travelers are willing to play along if it means cheap tickets. 
In September 2011, Ryanair reported a 6 percent climb in passenger traffic, increasing to 7.25 million from 6.84 
million the previous year.
O'Leary's cost-cutting measures may not always get the greenlight - and are often the subject of controversy - but 
the company's innovative milieu is something to admire. 
Introducing standing-room-only seating 
In July 2010, Ryanair introduced plans to charge passengers £4 (about $6) for standing-room-only seats.
The proposal involved removing the back 10 rows of seats from the airline's 250 planes and replacing them with 15 
rows of vertical seats. 
Ryanair claimed to be shopping the idea to Boeing, but the jetmaker wasn't too fond of bypassing European safety 
regulations to help customers save a few pennies. 
Asking overweight passengers to pay more
In 2009, Ryanair proposed a "fat tax" for overweight passengers after one-third of travelers voted in favor of the 
extra charge in an online poll conducted by the Irish carrier, according to The Guardian. 
One month later, the airline said it was dumping the contentious tactic because there was no way to collect the 
money without causing delays. 
Charging customers to use the toilet
All The Crazy Things Ryanair Has Done To Keep Flights Super Cheap (RYAAY)
In 2009, Ryanair considered charging passengers £1 (about $1.40) to use the toilets on board.
CEO Michael O'Leary told the BBC:
One thing we have looked at in the past, and are looking at again, is the possibility of maybe putting a coin slot on 
the toilet door, so that people might actually have to spend a pound to spend a penny in future. 
In 2011, the airline confirmed it was dropping the coin-operated scheme in favor of another controversial plan.

RYANAIR is in talks with aircraft manufacturers about the acquisition of up to 300 planes. The low-cost carrier 
apparently reckons it could pick up market share in Europe during this time of economic uncertainty, and so wants 
to expand its fleet. But Joseph Lampel, a professor of strategy at Cass Business School in London, is unconvinced 
by the rationale for such a move. I rather like his explanation:
One of history's enduring mysteries is why Napoleon invaded Russia. He had an empire, all the pomp and 
circumstance of an imperial court, and the all round title of military genius. And yet he could not resist the lure of 
complete domination of the European continent. He had plenty of victories, but what he wanted was total victory.
One gets the same feeling reading the news release about Michael O'Leary's ambition to acquire 300 aircraft from 
Russian or Chinese manufacturers if he cannot get them from Boeing and Airbus. The goal is to grow Ryanair to 
130 million passengers, which would make the airline the largest in Europe, and one of the largest in Europe [sic].
What is the rationale for this audacious expansion? It seems that Michael O'Leary is convinced that the economic 
recession will lead to mass defection from other airlines to Ryanair. What this assumption seemingly ignores is that 
the cost of air travel is a smaller proportion of the total cost of travel. The cost of being there is usually much greater 
of the cost of getting there. The recession is therefore likely to reduce air travel primarily because fewer people can 
afford to spend their hard earned cash on hotels, restaurants, and other travel pleasures.
Is O'Leary unaware of this basic economic reality? This is hard to say. What is clear is that he sees the current 
economic crisis as an opportunity to push aggressively forward where other airlines fear to tread. The risk he runs is 
that an extraordinary success story will come apart. It is not only that this expansion will stress Ryanair's 
organizational capacity and constrained terminal availability to the limit, but there are also other forces lurking in the 
background ready to take on O'Leary if he stumbles. There are shareholders who are told that they can expect 
much lower dividends during the expansion, and there are also O'Leary's many critics who have always felt that he 
cuts too many corners.
Perhaps he should take a lesson from Napoleon. When told by his advisers that the winters in Russia were 
exceptionally long and cold he insisted that they were misinformed. The winters in Moscow, he told them, were no 
colder than Paris, just a bit longer. He lived to find out that reality can bite.

EVER get the feeling you've been cheated? John Lydon asked the crowd that question at the end of the last 
concert performed by the original Sex Pistols, but it could perhaps be asked of today's air travellers as well. A study 
of more than 200 airlines by Amadeus, a company that provides technology to the travel industry, and IdeaWorks, a 
consulting organisation, reveals that carriers are expected to collect $32.5 billion in ancillary fees this year, for 
everything from baggage and onboard meals to advertising revenue. This represents a 44% increase on 2010's 
figure-and some travel advocates are wondering where the fees are heading. "Certainly, a lot of passengers are 
concerned about the cost of taking multiple bags," said David Jeanes of Transport Action Canada. "It's also 
somewhat unfair because it's a price per bag, rather than price per weight and for older people... who might be 
travelling with smaller bags so they can handle them... that's a concern."
North American carriers started pursuing ancillary revenues after oil prices soared in 2008, and have continued the 
practice ever since. And with spending on jet fuel across the world expected to rise by $10 billion from 2010 to 
2011, ancillaries are helping keep North American airlines afloat-to the tune of $15 billion this year. "As ancillary 
revenues continue to grow rapidly, we are now seeing increasing interest from full service carriers around the world, 
which are starting to implement ancillary services through global distribution systems," said Holger Taubmann, vice-
president of distribution at Amadeus.
The massive increase in fee-based revenues may not be as startling as it appears, though. IdeaWorks reckons 
almost half of the $9.9 billion rise can be chalked up to an increase in flyers and general revenues, with the rest of 
the increase split between better financial disclosure, stronger merchandising efforts and the sale of more services. 
The ubiquity of ancillary services is also dependent on the airline you're flying. Those charging the most fees, such 
as AirAsia, AerLingus and Ryanair ("Ancillary Revenue Champs", in the report's parlance), get 19.8% of their 
operating revenue from fees. The equivalent figure for the big seven American airlines is 11.9%, while low-cost 
carriers worldwide get 6.5%. At the bottom, traditional airlines such as Air China, Emirates and Singapore Airlines 
get an average of 2.9%, the same as last year. No matter what business model airlines choose, ancillary fees are 
here to stay: at least you don't always have to pay them.

Oct. 24, 2011 (China Knowledge) - The Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, a leading aircraft manufacturer in the 
country, has won an order for 20 C919 aircraft from Sichuan Airlines Co Ltd, making its total order to 165.
The Shanghai-based plane maker, however, did not disclose the listing price and aircraft delivery schedule. 
On Oct. 19, the leading Chinese aircraft manufacturer announced an order for 45 C919s from ICBC Financial 
Leasing Co, a unit of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China<601398><1398>. 
The C919 model is China's first self-developed commercial aircraft, said a person familiar with the matter, adding 
that Commercial Aircraft Corp of China expects the C919 to make its first flight in 2014 and to tap the commercial 
aircraft market two years later.
Ryanair Holdings, the biggest discount airline in Europe, in June expressed its intention to order at least 200 jets 
from Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, sources reported. 
China is expected to need about 5,000 new aircraft through 2030, 71% of which will be narrow-body planes, said 
Boeing Co, the world's leading aircraft maker.

Irish carrier RyanAir is known for coming up with unusual ways to cut costs in a steady effort to keep fares 
unthinkably low.
In 2009, for example, CEO Michael O'Leary proposed standing-seating, the logic being that you can stuff more 
passengers onto an aircraft when they are packed in vertically. 
Other cost-saving methods have included abolishing check-in desks, asking passengers to carry their own luggage 
onto the plane, and charging for in-flight meals.  
Now, in its latest penny-pinching scheme, the budget airline has introduced plans to reduce the number of toilets on 
each plane from three to one, allowing space for up to six extra seats.  
Trimming the number of onboard lavatories, thereby increasing the aircraft's carrying capacity, could slash ticket 
costs by as much as 5 percent, reports thejournal.ie.
While a spokesman for the carrier said the new layout will only be implemented on short-haul flights, it remains to 
be seen what distance passengers are willing to go - or at least how far their bladders will let them - to save 
money.

More German travelers have been using foreign airports since a flight tax was imposed early this year. Berlin 
appears to be following in the footsteps of the Netherlands, where a similar levy was trialed three years 
ago.Consider two small airports in the middle or Europe. At Maastricht Aachen Airport, business is booming thanks 
to an influx of German passengers who are fleeing a national aviation tax introduced on January 1, 2011. 
Meanwhile, just 80 kilometers across the border, Germany's Weeze Airport has been steadily losing customers.
A few years ago, things were exactly the opposite. The Netherlands had its own, yearlong experiment with an 
aviation tax, but revoked it in July 2009 after it saw Dutch hubs like Maastricht Aachen Airport lose passengers to 
rivals in neighboring countries, including Germany.
The levy cost Dutch airports, airlines, and related businesses between 1.2 and 1.3 million euros in lost revenue, 
according to a study by Amsterdam Aviation Economics, a research institute affiliated with the University of 
Amsterdam.
Hans van Mierlo, a professor of public finance at the University of Maastricht, said the abundance of transportation 
options in Europe means travelers can and will seek out alternatives whenever one country unilaterally imposes an 
air passenger tax.
"The [Dutch] crowd went to Germany; now the German crowd comes to us," he told Deutsche Welle. "I am 
surprised that the German government didn't learn from the Dutch failure."
 Hefty rates
The German aviation tax runs at a rate of eight euros per one-way flight within Europe, 25 euros for medium-haul 
services to the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, and 45 euros for long-haul flights. The tariff only applies to 
flights originating in Germany. The German Finance Ministry reported the duty raised 434 million euros in revenues 
in the first half of 2011.
However, for travelers, the tax can double the total cost of a bargain ticket. That has driven Irish budget carrier 
Ryanair to cancel some of its services from Weeze Airport and add flights at Maastricht. Meanwhile, rival airline 
Germanwings has launched a service linking Maastricht to Berlin 12 times per week.
German aviation tax pushes travelers to cross-border airports
Those moves helped drive Maastricht Aachen Airport's whopping 70 percent increase in passengers so far this 
year. That is quite a comeback from the time of the Dutch aviation tax, when it lost 25 percent of its customers.
 Among the new clientele is Ne Pham from Jülich, Germany. She told Deutsche Welle that she used to fly out of 
Cologne or Dusseldorf to destinations like Italy, the United States and her native Vietnam. 
"It's cheaper to fly from [Maastricht] than from Germany," she said. "It's easy to find, has lots of parking spaces, and 
a very fast check-in. It's small but nice."
Maastricht makeover
To accommodate new passengers, Maastricht Aachen Airport has renovated its main waiting area and sole 
restaurant. A new bus line runs from Cologne directly to the Dutch airport, where travelers are greeted by a row of 
flags from seven European countries. Airport staff members are required to speak German and English in addition 
to Dutch, and a number of them speak French as well.
Marion Schramm and her husband, from Geilenkirchen, Germany, echoed Pham's reasons for choosing Maastricht 
Aachen Airport. But they were not as impressed by the small airport's recent makeover.
"It's obviously dinky," Marion Schramm told Deutsche Welle, "You see everything right away. But it's a lot cheaper 
than Germany at the moment."
Weeze's woes
The German Airport Association, which represents German air hubs, has called for an immediate end to the 
national flight tax. It reported a tepid growth rate of 3.2 percent at airports throughout the country this July, 
compared with the same month last year.
Weeze Airport, near Dusseldorf, had 22.8 percent fewer customers in the same time period. Ludger van Bebber, 
the airport's managing director, said many of the hub's clients used to come from the Netherlands.
"The aviation tax destroys the level playing field for us," he told Deutsche Welle. "That is the main issue we have 
here at Weeze."
Meanwhile, Berlin's two hubs are seeing travelers hop across the border to nearby Polish airports. And people in 
Munich do not have to drive far to reach a number of alternative airports in Austria and the Czech Republic.
 Dutch chairman confident
While the German Finance Ministry has denied recent media reports that it might lower the aviation tax rates, the 
ministry is scheduled to evaluate the levy's effects on small and medium-sized airports in June 2012.
The chairman of Maastricht Aachen Airport, Jan Tindemans, said he is not worried about his business in the short 
term - even if Berlin ends up decreasing or revoking the tax.
He told Deutsche Welle that winning back market share in the wake of the Dutch tax experiment was very difficult. 
He does not expect things to be any easier for German hubs.
"No bakery wants its customers to go for one or two times to another bakery, because they always think [the 
customers] will stay there," he said. "There will be some people who will go back, but I don't think there will be much 
of an effect."
Tindemans said Maastricht Aachen Airport is seeking to add more airlines and destinations to its roster. He added 
that his airport could double annual traffic to almost one million passengers over the coming years if economic 
conditions remain stable.

Aachen Airport. But they were not as impressed by the small airport's recent makeover.
"It's obviously dinky," Marion Schramm told Deutsche Welle, "You see everything right away. But it's a lot cheaper 
than Germany at the moment."
Weeze's woes
The German Airport Association, which represents German air hubs, has called for an immediate end to the 
national flight tax. It reported a tepid growth rate of 3.2 percent at airports throughout the country this July, 
compared with the same month last year.
Weeze Airport, near Dusseldorf, had 22.8 percent fewer customers in the same time period. Ludger van Bebber, 
the airport's managing director, said many of the hub's clients used to come from the Netherlands.
"The aviation tax destroys the level playing field for us," he told Deutsche Welle. "That is the main issue we have 
here at Weeze."
Meanwhile, Berlin's two hubs are seeing travelers hop across the border to nearby Polish airports. And people in 
Munich do not have to drive far to reach a number of alternative airports in Austria and the Czech Republic.
 Dutch chairman confident
While the German Finance Ministry has denied recent media reports that it might lower the aviation tax rates, the 
ministry is scheduled to evaluate the levy's effects on small and medium-sized airports in June 2012.
The chairman of Maastricht Aachen Airport, Jan Tindemans, said he is not worried about his business in the short 
term - even if Berlin ends up decreasing or revoking the tax.
He told Deutsche Welle that winning back market share in the wake of the Dutch tax experiment was very difficult. 
He does not expect things to be any easier for German hubs.
"No bakery wants its customers to go for one or two times to another bakery, because they always think [the 
customers] will stay there," he said. "There will be some people who will go back, but I don't think there will be much 
of an effect."
Tindemans said Maastricht Aachen Airport is seeking to add more airlines and destinations to its roster. He added 
that his airport could double annual traffic to almost one million passengers over the coming years if economic 
conditions remain stable.

Berlin saw the fastest marathon in history on Sunday, but on the anniversary of the first-ever running of the storied 
race in ancient Greece, Germany learned that the current crisis in Athens won't be solved in a hurry. Stocks 
snapped a three-day winning streak, selling off late amid renewed European contagion concerns. With China's 
market falling to a 15-month low and U.S. durable goods orders down for a second month in three, the rest of the 
world hardly looks in fine fettle either. Save havens were scarce, cosmetics company Estee Lauder (EL) sliding 
6.40% and in no position to put lipstick on a PIIG. Bank of America (BAC), whose Merrill Lynch unit was driven to 
the brink of bankruptcy by Stanley O'Neal, declined 4.94% for the Dow's worst performance. Alcoa (AA), which 
rewarded his work with a lucrative position on its audit committee, fell 4.91% in a photo finish between beleaguered 
blue chips. (Eastman Kodak (EK), which cratered a further 14.84% to a fresh low, must have supplied the film.)
K-Swiss (KSWS), sponsored by a former tennis star, imploded 8.63%; if Anna will forgive me the phrase, that made 
it one of The Biggest Losers. Amazon bucked a bad day, ending up a tidy 2.45% to within touching distance of last 
week's all-time high. 1999 began with the euro and ended with Jeff Bezos man of the year; one has aged better 
than the other. History major Meredith Whitney marked an anniversary, and Andy Rooney indirectly reminded us 
that those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. He was born in 1919, the same year the Treaty of Versailles 
officially ended World War I. An exceptionally astute Frenchman, wary of Germany, prophetically said at its signing 
that "This is not peace. It is an armistice for 20 years." All these years on, the two countries are alas as divided as 
ever. Today in economics, analysts expect a slowdown in July pending home sales at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. On the 
earnings front AZZ Inc (AZZ), CalAmp Corp (CAMP), DemandTec (DMAN), Hennes  Mauritz, Micron (MU), 
Worthington Industries (WOR), and Xyratex (XRTX) are all due to report results.
INITIATIONS:
Agnico-Eagle Mines (AEM): The stock is initiated with an Overweight at HSBC Securities.
European airlines: JPMorgan rolls out an Underweight on Air France-KLM (AFLYY) and has new Neutrals on

Celestica (CLS): BMO Capital begins CLS with a Market Perform rating and assigns it a price objective of $8.50.
Upgrades & Downgrades: Advanced Micro Devices in Retreat
Chinese gaming stocks: Macquarie has an Underperform and $4 target price on Shanda Games (GAME), has a 
new Neutral on Perfect World (PWRD) ($15 target), and establishes Outperforms on Giant Interactive Group (GA) 
($4), NetEase.com (NTES) ($50), and Changyou.com (CYOU) ($40.)
Rigel Pharmaceuticals (RIGL): JP Morgan has a fresh Overweight on RIGL.
TravelCenters of America (TA): TA is a new Neutral at UBS.
Magellan Health (MGLN): The stock gets begun with a Buy at BBT Capital.
Asset managers: Blackstone (BX) is a new Neutral at Sterne Agee, which starts Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co. 
(KKR) with a Buy.

UPGRADES:
FMC Tech (FTI): FTI is taken to Overweight from Neutral at JP Morgan.

Qiagen (QGEN): Shares are moved to Outperform from Market Perform at Leerink Swann.
ONEOK (OKE): OKE is raised to Outperform from Market Perform with Wells Fargo.
DOWNGRADES:
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): Shares are slumping before the bell on several analyst downgrades. Among them 
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, which lowers the chip giant to Underperform from Neutral and takes its target down 
to $5 from $8. The analyst wrote in a note that "We prefer buy-rated Intel Corp (INTC) which is poised to gain in 
notebooks/servers near-term and has superior manufacturing prowess."
DaVita (DVA): DVA is cut to Hold from Buy at Citigroup.
Dril-Quip (DRQ): The stock is now Neutral from Overweight at JPMorgan.

Sept. 20--[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/.a/6a00d8341c630a53ef015391c042ba970b-pi]
     The airline industry is protesting the Obama administration's plan to increase fees and taxes on commercial 
passengers and corporate jets to help battle the nation's debt crisis.
     Two of the world's largest airline trade groups say the proposed fees and taxes would hurt the economy and 
force the industry to eliminate jobs.
     To help cut the nation's debt, the Obama administration has suggested doubling the aviation security fee 
imposed in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Each passenger is now charged $2.50 for each leg of a 
trip, with a maximum of $5 for a one-way trip. Under the proposal, the charge would be replaced with a standard $5 
per trip fee, with annual increase of 50 cents from 2013 to 2017.
     The fee could collect an additional $8.8 billion over five years and $24.9 billion over 10 years.
     The administration also wants to raise a per-flight fee from $60 to $100 for all corporate planes that fly in 
controlled airspace, generating an estimated $11 billion over 10 years.
     The Air Transport Assn., the trade group for the nation's largest airlines, said the industry already pays more 
than its share of taxes.
     "We oppose any new taxes on airlines or their passengers," said ATA President Nicholas E. Calio.
     The International Air Transport Assn., the trade group for the world's airlines, also issued a statement Tuesday, 
objecting to the proposed new fees.
     "Airlines and their passengers are being asked to pay for national security, although it clearly is a responsibility 
of government," said IATA Director General Tony Tyler.
     When it comes to adding new fees on passengers, however, the nation's airlines have not been reluctant to act.

airspace, generating an estimated $11 billion over 10 years.
The Air Transport Assn., the trade group for the nation's largest airlines, said the industry already pays more than 
its share of taxes.
"We oppose any new taxes on airlines or their passengers," said ATA President Nicholas E. Calio.
The International Air Transport Assn., the trade group for the world's airlines, also issued a statement Tuesday, 
objecting to the proposed new fees.
"Airlines and their passengers are being asked to pay for national security, although it clearly is a responsibility of 
government," said IATA Director General Tony Tyler.
When it comes to adding new fees on passengers, however, the nation's airlines have not been reluctant to act.
Airlines protest fee increase plan
The nation's largest airlines collected $1.38 billion for charging passengers to check baggage and change 
reservations in the first three months of the year, a 4% increase over the same period in 2010, according to the U.S. 
Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

Boeing (NYSE:BA) is betting big on China expecting that  increasing wealth and government spending on 
infrastructure will lead to continued growth in domestic passenger traffic. The company expects China's fleet size of 
planes will more than triple over the next 20 years, requiring around 5,000 new commercial aircraft worth $600 
billion during the same time-period. Boeing has 51-52% of Chinese market share, which it hopes to maintain. We 
believe that Boeing's long and close association with Beijing will help it get a large chunk of this expected demand, 
providing further upside to its stock price. Boeing competes in the commercial aircraft market with the European 
aerospace giant Airbus as well as Embraer (NYSE:ERJ) and Bombardier. Boeing will also face competition from 
Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), which is a state-backed firm developing its own commercial jet 
and expecting to start deliveries to customers from 2016.
We currently have a price estimate of $91 for Boeing's stock, about 40% above the current market price.
Chinese air travel to continue sky-rocketing
Air passenger trips in China grew by 16% from previous year. For the first time last year, the North American travel 
market was surpassed by travel within the Asia-Pacific region and Boeing expects that China will account for more 
than 40 percent of demand in the Asia Pacific region over the next 20 years.
((Boeing: Current Market Outlook 2011-2030))
Sustained economic growth, growth in trading activities, increasing wealth and continued market liberalization will 
help the growth in Chinese air industry. Also, its expected that major Chinese airlines will focus upon becoming 
global players and shift their focus to international markets, leading to increased demand for fleet. Growing China's 
in bound tourism will also support the growing demand for commercial aircraft.
Boeing's close association with China
Since 1916, Boeing has had a long history of cooperation with China. The company is the single largest purchaser 
of made-in-China aviation parts, committing hundreds of millions of dollars to dozens of suppliers. It also represents 
aircraft and services interests with annual turnover of roughly $5 billion dollars.
As Chinese Air Travel Booms, Boeing Hopes Orders Will Take Flight
China has a component role on every current Boeing commercial airplane model - the 737, 747, 767, 777, as well 
as the world's newest and most innovative airplane, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
We believe that this close relationship will help Boeing secure a major chunk of demand for new commercial aircraft 
and help increase Boeing's share of global commercial aircraft deliveries.
Increasing market share risk after COMAC's C919 debut in 2016
Boeing will likely face severe competition in Chinese market after 2016 when China's state-backed COMAC 
expects to start delivering its C919 commercial planes to customers. COMAC has already managed to enlist 
Ryanair as a customer, which currently flies only Boeing jets. This will hurt Boeing's share of global commercial 
aircraft deliveries after 2016.
You can drag the trend lines in the modifiable charts above to see the impact of these trends on Boeing's stock 
value.

Attention turns to the German courts tomorrow for a ruling on the legality of bailouts. Today, eyes are on Italy.
Italian PM Calls Vote of Confidence
Bloomberg reports Berlusconi Cabinet Will Call for Confidence Vote on Revised Austerity Plan
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called a Cabinet meeting today to authorize a confidence vote in Parliament 
on an amended 45.5 billion-euro ($64.5 billion) austerity plan that prompted a general strike.
The meeting at 6 p.m. in Rome will pave the way for a vote on the measures, which will include raising the value-
added tax rate by one percentage point to 21 percent, a 3 percent levy on incomes of more than 500,000 euros a 
year as well as an increase in the retirement age of women in the private sector starting in 2014, Berlusconi's office 
said in an e-mailed statement.
Travel Woes
The eight-hour walkout by CGIL, Italy's biggest union, disrupted travel and manufacturing as protests in Rome and 
other cities attracted as many as a million people, according to the union. Fifteen percent of workers at Fiat SpA (F) 
took part in the strike, the nation's biggest manufacturer said by e-mail.
Fifty-eight percent of employees stayed off the job, the union said in a statement on its website, citing a survey. 
Innovation Minister Renato Brunetta, citing a poll of 10 percent of civil servants, said 3.1 percent of public-sector 
workers participated in the strike, according to an e-mailed statement.
About 50 percent of trains, most of them regional, were halted, according to CGIL. Rome's two metro lines and local 
commuter trains were shut down, ATAC, the company that runs them, said in a statement on its website.
Stranded Passengers
Italian PM Calls Vote of Confidence; 70,000 Protest in Rome Against Austerity; Strikers Shut Down Transport; 
European Stocks at July 2009 Levels
Hundreds of people were stranded at airports in the capital and Milan as flights were delayed or canceled. Alitalia 
SpA said it canceled some domestic and international flights and Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) said it canceled 200 
flights to and from Italy, affecting some 35,000 passengers.
Italian Workers Strike Against Austerity Measures
The New York Times reports Italian Workers Strike Against Austerity Measures
Thousands of workers took to the streets in Italy on Tuesday in a general strike to protest a package of ever-
changing austerity measures required by the European Central Bank and now up for debate in the Italian Senate.
The eight-hour strike shut down transport and businesses nationwide. It was called by the C.G.I.L. union, which 
represents 2 million public and private sector workers, in opposition to a 45.5 billion-euro austerity package of tax 
hikes and spending cuts proposed by the Italian government last month to reduce Italy's budget deficit by 2013.
The Northern League, the most powerful party in Mr. Berlusconi's coalition, had been vehemently opposed to 
raising the retirement age for women, since in Italy public day care is scarce and grandmothers routinely serve as 
child care providers.
Addressing a crowd of an estimated 70,000 people in Rome on Tuesday, Susanna Camusso, the leader of C.G.I.L., 
called the change to the labor law "unjust" and threatened more strike actions if it weren't removed.
"If Parliament doesn't strike this from the bill, they have to know that we will use every path and initiative possible so 
that this shameful measure is removed," she told an estimated 70,000 supporters outside the Colosseum on 
Tuesday.
Pierluigi Bersani, the leader of the center-left opposition, criticized the measures. "This package should be 
strengthened and made more equitable," he said. "It's useless to pass it quickly if it's not done well. Otherwise we 
will end up having a new austerity package every week."
On Monday, Mario Draghi, the outgoing Bank of Italy president and incoming president of the European Central 
Bank, became the latest European leader to pressure Mr. Berlusconi to approve the measures swiftly.
He said that Italy should "not take it for granted" that the European Central Bank would continue buying Italian debt.
Expect Hit to Tourism
One of Italy's bright spots is tourism. Don't expect that to last if transportation disruptions become the norm.
European Stocks Lowest in Two Years
Please consider European Stocks Drop to Two-Year Low; Shell, Lloyds Lead DeclineEuropean stocks declined for 
a second day, dragging the Stoxx Europe 600 Index to the lowest in two years, amid concern that the global 
economy is slowing.
The Stoxx 600 lost 1.6 percent to 223.13 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the lowest since July 29, 2009. The 
gauge has tumbled 23 percent from this year's peak in February amid concern that Europe will fail to contain its 
sovereign-debt crisis and that the economic recovery in the U.S. will falter.
The Stoxx 600 pared an earlier loss of as much as 3.6 percent as the European Commission said it may present 
draft legislation on joint bond sales by euro-area nations when completing a report on the feasibility of common debt 
sales, putting pressure on Germany to drop its opposition.Euro Bonds Aren't Happening Anytime Soon, If Ever
This is the third reported euro-bond rally attempt in a few week. Here's the real deal: they aren't happening.
Italy Bond Yields Relatively Quiet
Italian PM Calls Vote of Confidence; 70,000 Protest in Rome Against Austerity; Strikers Shut Down Transport; 
European Stocks at July 2009 Levels
Yield  on Italian 10-Year government bonds was relatively quiet on a day of  massive turmoil elsewhere related to 
Swiss Franc intervention (see Switzerland  to "Buy Foreign Currency in Unlimited Quantities", Sets Euro Peg 1.20;  
Extreme Mid-Day Currency Volatility; Gold is Safe Haven, Not Francs)
No Confidence Stunt
Berlusconi's  approval rating is 22%. Nonetheless, he will survive a vote of no  confidence because for now, he has 
over 50% of the votes in Parliament. That Berlusconi needs to pull this stunt is certainly not confidence  inspiring.

Aircraft market hit by economy
Editor, The Times:
The article "This is not your comrade's Soviet jet" in the Business section should give pause to the many Boeing 
IAM members who think they can continue to strike and demand more [Sept. 1].
The comment by Stephen McNamara, a spokesman for Ryanair, throws cold water on the attitude that Boeing jets 
are the best and will always sell.
"Most passengers," he said, "don't care what type of airplane they fly."
Ryanair, whose current active fleet is only Boeing 737s, announced negotiations to buy a planned Chinese 
competitor to the Boeing 737, the C-919, which is expected to be cheaper, the article stated.
Looks like the global economy has hit the commercial-aircraft market, too.

New York, August 30th (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) are trading 
very close to calculated resistance at $27.35 with the current price action closing at just $26.13 placing the stock 
near levels that make it
difficult to buy.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's current stock range is defined by current calculated support defined at $24.92 and by the 
resistance level at $27.35, the stock is clearly over-extended from support, making it difficult to establishing new 
long positions at this level.
Traders don't have a clear entry point for Ryanair, as the stock is well above support, however, as the stock pulls 
back towards $24.92 it
will definitely provide a reference point to establish a trade. On the other hand if the stock decides to break above 
resistance level at $27.35 then traders
will get an opportunity to enter Ryanair stock by establishing a position as the stock moves to a higher range.

IT'S been an unusual week for flight delays. An SAS service from Stockholm to Chicago was grounded on Tuesday 
when a mouse was spotted gambolling round the cabin before passengers boarded. The mouse could not 
subsequently be found, so the decision was taken to rebook the passengers on different flights because of fears the 
animal might damage the electric wiring. But that incident was positively humdrum compared with goings-on in 
Paris on the same day, where a CityJet flight bound for Dublin was delayed for two hours after Gérard Depardieu, a 
French actor, appeared to urinate, or at least spill urine, in the cabin just before take-off. Full story here.
Inconvenient animals and misbehaving passengers are not unheard of as causes of delays, though this is the first 
time we've heard of an actor using an Evian bottle in such a manner. Our selection below highlights some other 
occasions where weary passengers would have had especially good reasons for cursing their flying luck.
Rats
It's one thing for a loveable mouse to ground your plane, but in June a Qantas flight was grounded for a day and 
passengers were rebooked onto new flights after five baby rats were found in a medical cabinet on board. Similarly, 
passengers due to fly with Alaska Airlines in February were moved to another plane when a rat was spotted in the 
cabin of their original craft after it had already left the gate. And a "giant rat" spied in an overhead locker by a 
passenger caused the grounding of an Air Canada flight heading to London in February 2010. At least that rodent 
was found and removed. A Thomas Cook flight from Paphos to London in February 2011 was delayed because the 
pilot had spotted a rat on the inbound flight. It left 24 hours late with its passengers on board, even though the rat 
had not been found. 
Pythons 
Four baby pythons escaped from their cage during a Qantas flight from Alice Springs to Melbourne in 2009. They 
could not be found, so the plane was taken out of service and fumigated (killing the pythons if they were still on 
board), and passengers due to head to Sydney on the plane were moved to different flights.
Cat
You're grounded
A Pakistani International Airways flight left Manchester 26 hours late in October 2006 because a cat that had been 
discovered on the plane during the inbound flight from Karachi had gone missing. After the craft had been partially 
stripped down the animal was eventually located and persuaded off the plane by a vet.
Naughty passengers 
A Ryanair flight from the Canary Islands was delayed by three hours in February this year when passengers got 
angry about excess-baggage charges. All 166 passengers were eventually ordered off the plane, and only 66 of 
them were allowed back on.
Too much fuel
The captain of an easyJet flight accidentally loaded with an excessive ten tonnes of fuel asked 37 passengers to 
volunteer to get off plane on Boxing Day 2010. When only seven stepped forward, the last 30 passengers to have 
booked their tickets were ordered off the craft. Some claimed afterwards that they had been threatened with arrest if 
they did not comply.
Blocked toilets
The departure of a Biman Bangladesh flight from Dhaka to London in August 2009 was delayed for ten hours 
thanks to its blocked toilets. Engineers spent two hours sorting out the problem, apparently caused by passengers 
trying to flush inappropriate items down the loos, but the flight was then delayed for another 7½ hours (which must 
really have tried the passengers' patience) to ensure the plane arrived at Heathrow during the permitted arrival 
hours.
Unsuitable pilot
The pilot of a S7 Airlines plane bound for Moscow from Frankfurt in October 2009 was denied take-off permission 
because staff had smelt alcohol on his breath. A test confirmed their suspicions and he was replaced shortly 
afterwards by another pilot. In a similar story ten months earlier, the pilot of an Aeroflot service heading from 
Moscow to New York was replaced after passengers rebelled because of the way he slurred his words over the 
Tannoy. An Aeroflot representative who came on board the plane to assess matters apparently said that it was "not 
such a big deal" if the pilot was drunk.
Arabic spoken
In August 2007 an American Airlines flight from San Diego to Chicago returned to the gate and then, because it had 
missed the curfew for night-time departures, did not end up leaving until the following morning. The reason? A 
passenger had decided she wanted to get off the plane. According to the Chicago Sun Times, "The woman first 
complained to the flight crew that six men were possibly speaking Arabic in the boarding area. The woman added 
that they 'had odd behavior.'"

If you've flown on a commercial airline in the last couple of years, you've probably paid a fee to check your 
baggage. You've probably hated it. You've probably wondered why your airline would commit so egregious a 
customer service faux pas just to collect a few extra dollars.
Because it isn't just a few dollars.
Delta collected nearly a billion dollars in baggage fees last year. Spirit's portion of revenue attributed to baggage 
fees now exceed 10%. Folks, that's a lot of money; those fees aren't going away. Ever. Can you say "real business 
change"?
It's not nearly so controversial as when RyanAir proposed having passengers pay to use the bathroom. And of 
course, that's why it will stick. When business change makes sense, it ... makes sense.
Wal-Mart doesn't cut paper pay checks any more. In fact, it's been a couple of years since the largest company in 
the USA made that business change. And I told you just last week that the traditional credit card merchant account 
might be on its last legs. These are the kinds of business changes that work. The kind you want to uncover to grow 
your business. The kind that we specialize in here at Answer Guy Central.
You know what to do now ...

Does big data really amount to anything more than the data we had all along? It all depends on how it's put to use, 
writes Alistair Croll in a post at O'Reilly Radar. If big data is left buried in silos, it might as well be no data.
The companies that have made the most of big data have been disruptive start-ups, Croll writes, citing Zappos, 
Amazon, Craigslist, eBay, Ryanair and others. "One by one, industry incumbents are withering under the harsh light 
of data," he writes. "Large companies with entrenched business models tend to cling to their buggy-whips."
It's hard to disrupt your own business model, but that's not simply the result of complacency. Entrenched 
enterprises have more to lose than start-ups have, and they can't take as great risks. While start-ups can ask 
forgiveness, established companies have to ask for permission, Croll writes.
Making the most of big data comes down to knowing which questions to ask, he suggests. Viewing an old problem 
in a new light is the path that successful start-ups take. To find value in huge volumes of data, companies have to 
make the right queries. "Without the right questions, there really is no such thing as big data--and today, it's the 
upstarts that are asking all the good questions," he writes.

Aug. 8, 2011 (The Business Insider delivered by Newstex) -- 
The trial for three men aged 53, 64, and 70 for aggravated robbery started today in Sweden, in what has been 
dubbed the "Old-Timer Gang", The Local reports.
The trio of men allegedly used explosives to conduct a series of robberies in southern Sweden and Denmark 
between 2007 and 2010.
Police confiscated weapons and a series of explosives that they say the men used to execute robberies, and got 
additional information via a wiretap.
In one of the wiretapped conversations, the 64-year-old allegedly talked about his dislike of the police.
"I could go into the station and shoot thirty of them. I really hate them. There are way too few coppers shot in 
Sweden. At least ten should be shot per month," he reportedly said. 
The Local reports that the men were winking and smiling at each other during the trial while the prosecution gave 
their opening statements. 
Here are the mugshots and CCTV footage of the "Old-Timers Gang":

Aug. 8, 2011 (The Business Insider delivered by Newstex) -- 
Forget the volatile stock market. Everyone will be watching airfares today.
That's because late last week, the US Senate approved a bill that would extend the Federal Aviation 
Administration's funding authority until next month. It means the 7.5 percent tax is back, and fares could suddenly 
rise, which would anger many passengers.
I have the backstory here.
The important thing is that by midnight today, most of the airlines will have to decide whether to raise their fares or 
return their prices to where they were before the tax expired. If they raise prices, then lawmakers have essentially 
helped the airline industry impose an across-the-board 7.5 percent fare hike.
It wouldn't be the first time the government has helped the airline industry, of course. And most are betting that the 
airlines won't do it. It's bad PR. Plus, it makes them look like piggies.
Then again, if the big airlines unilaterally raise their fares by 7.5 percent, it wouldn't be the stupidest thing they've 
done in regards to pricing. In fact, the airline business is a case study in how not to price a product.
Here are four other pricing mistakes the airlines make.
Not offering an "all-in" price. Sure, businesses often break out mandatory taxes and other required fees from their 
prices. But the airline industry has turned this into an art form. For example: Offering roundtrip ticket based on a 
one-way fare, even though there's no way to buy a one-way ticket (makes the fare seem half as expensive). This is 
endlessly frustrating to air travelers, who often have to wait until they are at the end of their purchase to find out the 
true cost of their ticket.
Adding "gotcha" fees after the purchase. For years, the cost of a checked bag was included in the price of an airline 
ticket. But several years ago, airlines began a process called "unbundling," which turned out to be quite profitable. 
5 Deceptive Ways Airlines Take Your Money
(They collected $3.4 billion in baggage fees last year, according to a recent study by IdeaWorks.) But the fees are 
endlessly frustrating to air travelers, in part because of their inadequate disclosure, and in part because it's difficult 
to know exactly how much air transportation will cost. (Wireless phone companies also practice this kind of 
deceptive pricing.)
Not leaving well enough alone.  If you think you know what's included in the price of a ticket, and what isn't, just wait 
a week. Some airline, somewhere, will come up with a new mandatory fee. In Europe, Ryanair is known for its 
many annoying extras, from fees for seat reservations to fees for printing a boarding pass. In the US, rogue 
discount carrier Spirit Airlines isn't far behind, charging for carry-on bags and printing a boarding pass. This 
constant change leads to confusion and hostility from customers (but alas, not enough to make people stop flying).
Bragging about it. It is one thing to practice the dark art of deceptive pricing behind closed doors. It is quite another 
to shout about it from the highest rooftops. But that is exactly what airline executives have done, much to the 
dismay of their customers. Earlier this year, a United Airlines executive talked about his airline's status as a leader 
in "ancillary revenues and in innovation" and late last year, a US Airways executive told an investor conference that, 
were it not for fees, his airline wouldn't have been profitable. Geez, you'd think they would keep that kind of 
nonsense to themselves, don't you?
This isn't a tirade against airline pricing. (Oh, alright, it kind of is.) But how many of these same pricing mistakes do 
you see other businesses make? This kind of corporate idiocy is widespread.
Tried to buy a concert ticket from Ticketmaster lately? Taken a look at your cellular phone bill? Heck, try to buy a 
car and just see how many price games are played with you, the unwitting customer.
But I think airlines set the standard when it comes to stupid pricing practices. And I have a feeling we're about to 
find out just how stupid they really are. Midnight is only a few hours away.

Aug. 5, 2011 (The Business Insider delivered by Newstex) -- 
Irish budget airline Ryanair is denying claims that it offered a sandwich and a soda to a passenger suffering from a 
heart attack and later charged the sick man, reports the Irish Independent.
Per-Erik Jonsson was on a flight from England to Sweden when he suffered a heart attack and fell unconscious.
"[The flight attendants] said he had low blood pressure and gave him a sandwich and a soda. And they made sure 
he paid for it," the man's daughter, Billie Appleton, told Swedish newspaper Aftonblade.
Appleton claims she had to hit her father's chest to keep him breathing, and they had to drive themselves to the 
hospital once the plane touched down.
It is an EU regulation that all plane's must have staff trained for medical emergencies.
Ryanair responded (via the Daily Mail):
In line with procedures for such cases a Ryanair cabin crew suggested a diversion to the nearest airport or to have 
an ambulance on stand-by on arrival at Skavsta, so that the passenger could receive medical treatment.
However, the passenger's companion, who identified herself as a nurse, declined this offer.
The family are demanding an apology.

Its pocket sized, pumps out super quality sound and has even been designed by a former NASA engineering 
legend, what could be a better companion than to accompany you on your travels than the FoxLv2 Bluetooth for 
iPad portable speakers?
As the rain falls miserably on the British Isles “ in the North at least “ our minds are cast to our impending summer 
holiday in the sun and all those glorious beach parties we are going to attend. As we look out of the office window, 
depressed by the cars having their headlights on at four in the afternoon in mid-July, we start to imaginary pack our 
suitcase. Space “ and weight “ is of the essence if we do not want to be stung for an extra £40 by Ryanair at the 
airport for going a kilo over the weight allowance, so the smaller our gadgets are the better.
Being the first pocket-sized wireless speaker, Dr. Godehard Guenthers, the former NASA audio ˜legend company 
Soundmatters, informs us, the FoxLv2 Bluetooth for iPad makes the ˜perfect travel companion. Not only is it small 
enough to slip in your pocket or bum-bag and carry it down to the beach, but the FoxLv2 also consists of some 
apparently unique features.
These unique features include œTwoofers, œBassBattery, œDomeForward and œLinear Magnetic Drive, which to 
non-musical purists basically means these portable Bluetooth speakers deliver a smooth and high quality listening 
experience.
Battery life is a critical criterion of modern ˜travel gadgets, especially when accompanying one to the beach and, 
with a patented re-chargeable built-in woofer/battery, the FoxLv2 lasts for 8 hours “ yep that should just last the 
duration of a day at the beach.
The FoxLv2 Bluetooth for iPad “ Speakers made for the beach
As we plan what we are taking on holiday we tot up how much our suitcase of goodies is going to cost, and being 
priced at $199, the FoxLv2  Bluetooth for iPad will certainly boost your pre-holiday spending budget, although it 
could be worth it.

[ Image removed: Aberystwyth, Wales ]
 When deciding where to go for a beach vacation, Aberystwyth in Wales probably isn't the first place you think of. It 
wasn't ours either. My wife and I picked it on the advice of an English friend who had never been there and about 
an hour's research on the Internet. We like to travel by the seat of our pants because it usually leads to a great 
experience. Usually.
 Since this will not be an entirely positive article let's get the downsides out of the way. First, the beach is stony and 
smells of rotting seaweed. Second, in four days of eating out at restaurants recommended by locals the only decent 
meals we had were at our BB and a Sunday roast at The Fountain Inn. Third, there's no nightlife outside the pubs 
and we saw a bunch of football hooligans fighting on the street outside one of them. Blood flowing, police sirens 
wailing, the whole nine yards. I feel bad mentioning these things because the locals were generally very nice. Most 
of those football hooligans were actually Scottish. Let's get on to the good things.
 Aberystwyth has been a popular seaside resort for a century, although now it's suffering from competition from 
easyJet and Ryanair. In the days before 100 round-trip fares, working class people could only afford to go to places 
like Aberystwyth or Blackpool. Now they can go to Cyprus or Spain. While this is bad for the local economy, it does 
bring prices down, making Aberystwyth a good spot for budget travelers. Our BB, the Seabrin Guest House, was a 
ridiculously cheap 55 a night for me, my wife, and son. We got a delicious breakfast and a huge bay window 
overlooking the sea. Some of our best moments in Aberystwyth were lounging in front of the Seabrin drinking beer 
and watching the sunset with the owners.

(OOTC:RYAOF)  (NASDAQ:RYAAY)  (           NASDAQ:RYAAY), early in the trading session. Ryanair is currently 
trading lower by 0.87%, so definitely the sellers in control, as the stock's volume is already above average.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair has already traded 1.668 times its 3-month average volume, and has calculated support and resistance at 
$25.58 and $30.55 respectively. Traders like to use volume as their lie detector for price action moves through 
predefined trading ranges.
The overall market index SP 500 is trading lower by -0.39% from its previous trading close, which means that 
Ryanair stock is underperforming the overall market.

The easy part is taking all the photos. The slightly harder part is knowing which are worth foisting on other people, 
not least because foisting is more complicated than taking. Anyway, I hope you enjoy these Brittany holiday snaps 
which I took a couple of months ago and have now picked out as worth exhibiting here.
My usual Brittany airport destination has been Brest, quite close to where the friends whom I regularly visit live, in 
Quimper. But, probably because of the new and very obviously architect-designed buildings, all plate glass and 
shiny metal at peculiar angles, that have been constructed at Brest airport, Ryanair no longer sends its 737s from 
Stansted to Brest. It either costs them too much or it takes them too long to turn their planes around, or some 
combination of the two. Ryanair prefers its airports to be not very glorified sheds.
So instead I arrived in Brittany at Dinard, near the coastal town of St Malo. And when my friend came by car from 
the other end of Brittany to collect me, it made sense for us to have a wander around St Malo, which has a 
particularly fine smaller and older version of itself, right next to the sea, with a wall around it that you can walk on 
top of.
On the evening of my arrival I observed this:
What could it be? A wreck perhaps? Odd.
A week later, in the course of my return home, we visited St Malo again, and once again took a stroll around the old 
town walls. The tide, having been in when I arrived, was out, and all was revealed:
           
It's a swimming pool, refreshed and replenished every time the tide comes in. Which makes a lot of sense. When 
the tide goes out in that particular part of coastal France, it goes out a long way, and wherever the sea is, my guess 
Some not so recent Brittany pictures
is that the currents in it can play evil tricks, what with the tides having such a long way to travel, andthrough such 
complicated places. How much nicer to wait for the tide to be out, and to take a swim in a nice safe pool, as this 
person obligingly proved for me.
           
Now here are a couple snaps of images done by other people, both timeless and universal in their different ways. 
First, an advertisement, on a bus shelter:
           
I don't think I need comment on that, other than to say that I haven't seen this particular advert in England. Which 
proves ... I don't know what.
Second, another universal set of circumstances:
           
Not very well photoed by me, for which apologies, through a shiny shop window. Had I been a cleverer 
photoshopper, I might have been able to straighten that out, but you surely get the picture, and clicking on it makes 
it that bit clearer, as with all of these snaps.
A sheep in the middle is saying "Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me", to get to the precipice quicker.
Again, I'll let readers draw their own conclusions about what particular contemporary circumstance is being 
portrayed. Euro purchasers perhaps? You decide.
Finally, a surfer, photoed through rain:
           
This was taken at something called the            Baie des Trépassés, which does not mean the Bay of the Very Out of 
Date. Trépassés means people who have trespassed as in "crossed over", in other words people who are dead. 
The very same complicated coastal currents which caused anyone drowned at sea anywhere near it to wash up at 
the Baie des Trépassés (hence the name) now cause the waves in the Baie des Trépassés to be bigger than in any 
nearby places, hence the surfers. Of the many intriguing places I have visited in Brittany, this was the weirdest. The 
vile weather when I saw this place only added to the weirdness.

The latest Competition Commission (CC) ruling requiring BAA to sell Stansted and one of its Scottish aiports - 
probably Glasgow - has to be welcomed. To be sure, this divestment process has been exceedingly protracted - 
taking over five years to date with the possibility of yet another appeal to the courts by BAA. Back in 2006, Spain's 
Ferrovial led a consortium which paid over £10 billion for BAA - a take-over that has undoubtedly destroyed 
shareholder value. Some sympathy has to be extended to the consortium given the wholesale change in the 
competitive landscape for UK airports - a case of not just moving the goalposts but of shifting the entire pitch.
However, the widely-reported shambles at Heathrow, for which BAA must bear much of the blame, acted as a 
stimulus for reform. As such, the CC was let loose, which eventually led to the sale of Gatwick for £1.5 billion. It is 
now proposed that the sale of Stansted should progress with haste. Likely buyers include infrastructure funds, 
although all potential bidders will carefully scrutinise the amount of capital expenditure that will be required at 
Stansted. The ownership of Scotland's main airports will also be split, with the likelihood that BAA will retain the 
thriving Edinburgh airport.
Crucially, as UK airport ownership becomes increasingly fragmented, airlines now have greater choice rather than 
being dependent on a near BAA monopoly, as was the case before the Gatwick sale - a subject on which Ryanair's 
outspoken Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, has robust views. Moreover, greater comparative operating data will 
become available which should drive up overall efficiency levels.
Looking forward, the UK's three main airports - Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted - surrounding London are 
expected to become increasingly competitive: Luton is also growing strongly. Of course, if you are part of the 
Ferrovial consortium, you will feel very short-changed by forced sales, such as that at Gatwick. Indeed, such major 
regulatory U-turns should normally be avoided. But introducing far more competition into the ownership of the UK's 
airports has to be the best long-term solution.

   Jul. 21, 2011 (The Business Insider delivered by Newstex) --
Americans have dominated the heavens from the Wright Brothers first powered flight to the space shuttle Atlantis 
final touchdown this morning. Is this the end of our nations aeronautics leadership “ and should we care?
Lets not over-dramatize. NASA is not going out of business. In military applications, our hardware and crew 
capabilities run circles around everyone else, as the Pakistanis can attest after the stealth raid that killed Osama bin 
Laden. Boeing remains one of the global leaders in commercial aviation, though it is challenged at the middle and 
upper segments of the market by Airbus and at the lower end by Brazils Embraer, among others.
We even lead in Hollywoods version of the skies. When an asteroid threatens to destroy Earth on the big screen, 
who ya gonna call “ China? No way. Not yet, at least.
But that could change.            Chinas space program is ambitious, apparently well-funded, and mostly secret. While 
U.S. scientists share the International Space Station with collaborators from other nations, the Chinese plan to 
launch the first module for a future station of their own later this year. They intend to move into their new home in 
space in 2020, which is the year the ISS is scheduled to close. Unless plans for a replacement move ahead quickly, 
China may be the only country with a permanent manned presence in space a decade from now.
China is also on the move in commercial aviation. The nations leadership decided to get into the business in a 
serious way less than a decade ago. The first step was the development of the Comac (for Commercial Aircraft 
Corp. of China) ARJ21, a 70- to 100-passenger regional jet. Six prototypes have been built for testing, and 
commercial flights may begin late this year. Most of the 239 initial orders have been by Chinese and            nearby 
Asian airlines, but a unit of General Electric (NYSE:GE)  has signed up for five of the planes with an option for 20 
more. (Not coincidentally, GE engines power the ARJ21.)
A Final Touchdown
China also has its sights set on larger aircraft. Ireland-based Ryanair signed an agreement last month to help 
Comac develop and launch its C919 narrow-body jet, which boasts a capacity of up to 200 passengers, by 2018. 
This was unwelcome news for Boeing. Ryanair currently flies 272 of Boeing (NYSE:BA) s 737 jets, configured to 
carry 189 passengers each.
The decline, real or potential, of American leadership is not a story about China, however; it is a story about us. For 
roughly the first two-thirds of the 20th century, we made all sorts of efforts to fly faster, farther, longer and higher 
than anyone else dared. This was never truer than after the Sputnik scare in 1957; we feared Soviet leadership in 
space and missile technology, and we certainly did not want to give up aviation bragging rights to the Communists. 
So we set ourselves on a mission to get to the moon.
But by the time we did it, we started asking ourselves why we did it. It was expensive. Its practical and financial 
value was unclear. Then as now (and always), there were conflicting priorities and demands for government money.
The space shuttle program just barely made it into the window before we essentially closed up shop on new 
government-built manned space vehicles. President Richard Nixon authorized the shuttle program in 1971. A 
decade later, Columbia made the first shuttle flight. Today, essentially the same craft that was designed in the early 
1970s finished its final mission, still the largest and most capable human-carrying vehicle in the skies. The shuttle 
never lived up to its hype as a cheap, reusable craft that would be safe enough for civilians and cost-effective 
enough to launch every week, but when it first flew, it was decades ahead of anything else.
I have watched about a half-dozen shuttles soar into the sky, mostly from a beach near our Florida home, 80 miles 
away. Even at that distance it is spectacular, especially at night. I was disappointed when clouds obscured our view 
of the final launch earlier this month.
I will still get to see rockets blast off from the Kennedy Space Center. The current Delta (NYSE:DAL) , 
Atlas/Centaur and Titan rockets, however, are considerably smaller than the shuttle “ which was considerably 
smaller than the Saturn V rockets that carried the Apollo missions to the moon. In heavy lift capabilities, we have 
made no progress in nearly a half-century.
We rested on our laurels in civil aviation, too. Boeings flagship 747 first flew commercially in 1970. It was the largest 
passenger plane in the skies for 37 years, before the Airbus A380 eclipsed it. Bigger is not always better, and 
Boeing did make many improvements under the skin over the years to keep the 747 competitive, yet the fact 
remains that when you want to move the most people or freight over large distances, the best answer no longer is 
an American product.
Boeings 737, 757 and 767 are also dated designs, and the 757 was discontinued in 2004. I prefer to fly in the more 
modern and comfortable Airbus A320s and A330s. Boeings wide-body 777 is a worthy competitor to the Airbus 
A340, of similar 1990s vintage. Were all still waiting for our first flight in Boeings oft-delayed new entrant in the big-
jet category, the 787 œDreamliner. The company hopes to put the first one in commercial service later this year.
So were still in the game, even if were not winning in a rout. Which gets us back to the question of whether it 
matters. How important is it that the most capable, most efficient, most reliable flying machines be designed and 
built in this country?
Important enough, I would say, not to give up our leadership position without a good reason and without a fight. 
Even after a century of flight, aviation still has room to get better: safer, faster, cheaper, quieter, more comfortable, 
or more fuel-efficient. The advances we made in aviation have often filtered into other areas of our lives, and the 
material benefits of building and deploying better aircraft contribute to our high standard of living.
A Final Touchdown
We invented powered flight. We had the leading role in advancing it to where it is today. The shuttles missions are 
over, but I think flying “ in the atmosphere or beyond it “ can still take us places.

This exceedingly large jacket may not appeal to fashionistas, but it could be the answer to airlines' baggage fees 
(via            The Daily Mail).
Fed up with the strict rules imposed by budget carriers like EasyJet and Ryanair, Andrew Gaule invented the Rufus 
Roo, a lightweight polyester jacket whose six pockets hold 10kg worth of baggage.
That's enough room to carry tons of stuff, from spare clothing to a laptop, Gaule told            The Daily Mail.
The baggy coat is not only convenient, it's also a money saver. The average family spends up to $700 checking 
bags on Ryanair holiday flights, according to a recent study reported on by The Daily Mail.
The            jacket comes in a variety of colors sized for for men, women, and children, and costs around $50 U.S. 
dollars.

 New York, July 7th (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (OOTC:RYAOF)  (NASDAQ:RYAAY)  (      
     NASDAQ:RYAAY) ended the trading  session higher by $0.29 or 1.01% from its previous close. Ryanair's price 
action formed what is considered to be a bullish engulfing candle that could very well signal continuation of trend or 
reversal on ongoing weakness.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's recent stock range has been formed by a trough where calculated support was defined at $28.56 and by 
a peak that established the  resistance level at $30.55, which could be used by traders planning their trades.
Traders wanting to establish a position in Ryanair or traders that are already holding the stock can use the bullish 
engulfing pattern to their advantage. The pattern provides a defined risk as it shows where the  bears were able to 
push the stock down, before the bulls stepped in.
The bullish engulfing pattern is a leading indicator that provides an alert to the bulls that the trend will continue or 
that there is an immediate reversal to the short term weakness seen on the stock. Below an Engulfing Bullish

 New York, July 5th (TradersHuddle.com) - Unusual high volume detected on shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC 
(OOTC:RYAOF)  (NASDAQ:RYAAY)  (           NASDAQ:RYAAY), early in the trading session. Ryanair is currently 
trading lower by 1.04%, so definitely the sellers in control, as the stock's volume is already above average.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair has already traded 2.341 times its 3-month average volume, and has calculated support and resistance at 
$28.93 and $30.55 respectively. Traders like to use volume as their lie detector for price action moves through 
predefined trading ranges.
The overall market index SP 500 is trading lower by -0.25% from its previous trading close, which means that 
Ryanair stock is underperforming the overall market.

by the price of fuel.

   Jun. 22, 2011 (China Knowledge Newswires delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Jun. 22, 2011 (China Knowledge) - Ryanair, an Irish low-cost airline with its head office at Dublin Airport, and the 
Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd, the maker of the country's first home-grown jumbo jet, have signed a 
memorandum of understanding in Paris, sources reported.
According to the MOU, COMAC will help Ryanair design an aircraft that could rival Ryanair's fleet aircraft, the 
Boeing (NYSE:BA)  737.
The deal suggests that Ryanair may look beyond its main supplier U.S.-based Boeing Co and rival Airbus SAS, the 
world's largest commercial plane maker, to buy aircraft from other rivals.
Some analysts said the MOU may also suggest that Ryanair expect to put pressure on Boeing to provide better 
terms for a large fleet upgrade. Talks between Ryanair and Boeing on a 200-plane order broke down in 2009, but 
Ryanair said it would not rule out a fresh order if Boeing improved its terms.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest short-haul airline, said in May that it had met with officials from COMAC and Russian 
rival United Aircraft.
State-owned COMAC said it expects to sell 2,000 jumbo jets, the homegrown C919, during the next two decades. 
The company has won orders of 100 C919 jumbo jets and the figure will increase this year, said Wu Guanghui, vice 
general manager of the COMAC and the jumbo jet's chief designer.

Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) has recently signed an agreement with CFM International, one 
of the world's major aircraft engine makers, making the engine maker the sole overseas supplier for its C919 
passenger plane's propulsion system. The LEAP-X1C engine under development by CFM International was 
designated as the only powerplant for C919, the first Chinese-made trunkliner. Flagship product of Comac, C919 
features 168 seats for all-economy class layout and 156 seats for hybrid class layout. Its designed standard range 
is 4,075 km and extended range 5,555 km, which enables it to operate on diversified air routes. The group is also 
expected to ink a memorandum of understanding with Ryanair, an Irish budget airline on future cooperation during 
the show, sources close to Comac said. According to its plan, Comac would complete contract-signing with 
aerostructure and airborne system suppliers for C919 aircraft this year.

has developed a reputation. He's loud. He says what's on his mind. He really doesn't care what you think about 
him. He's probably broken every rule of            public relations and            investor relations. I've been with            
Gadling since December 2008, and O'Leary has been a great source of posts every step of the way.
So, he's the CEO and he can say what he wants. This isn't really how it works: most CEOs have plenty of people 
telling them what to say and when to shut up. This is why O'Leary has it made.
And now it's time for my confession: five reasons I'm jealous of Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair:

Spirit Airlines has never shied away from controversy in its advertising, so it should be no surprise its latest 
campaign            features strippermobiles that say, "Ill go both ways for $18."
It's just another chapter in years of cheap sex jokes and double entendres that capitalizes on the 12-year old boy in 
every consumer.
Spirit became the first ultra-low cost carrier in the US when it restructured to fit the Ryanair mold in 2007.  It has 
been planning an IPO since last September, but delayed pricing in May.
Every time a big event or scandal has come along, Spirit's been there. Its current "Weiner Sale" campaign 
showcases a hot dog, with the promise that the fares are "too HARD to resist." And if that's not enough, Spirit also 
announced that there's a Weiner Sale "expansion," but they're not going to "enlarge" the fares.
Spirit's first foray into these types of ads was its "Hunt for Hoffa" game, in which the player had to dig around to find 
missing union leader Jimmy Hoffa's body (2006) 
Then there was the airline's MILF campaign: Many Islands, Low Fares (2007) 
Tiger Woods couldn't escape Spirit's wrath, getting targeted by the airline's Eye of the Tiger sale (2009)

   Jun. 7, 2011 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Michael O'Leary - loved, presumably, by his mother and probably not many else - truly wants passengers to pay 
less to fly. Of course, that's the point of a low-cost carrier like Ryanair, right? Well, O'Leary, the airline's CEO, loves 
his            passengers so much that he doesn't want them to pay taxes. At least, not the UK's Air Passenger Duty.
Someone has to get slammed, though. If one tax goes away, there needs to be another to take its place.
Always thinking ahead, O'Leary has suggested that the burden be shifted to the hospitality industry, which could 
replace most of the revenue from the Air Passenger Duty with a modest levy of £1 per night on hotel rooms.
In fairness, O'Leary notes that the APD is the highest flight tax in the world, and it's keeping people off planes. 
Since 2007, he told the Daily Telegraph, "Visitor numbers to Britain have fallen from 33 million to 29.5 million." Now, 
the fact that the global financial crisis and subsequent recession happened during this period may (or may not) 
have something to do with the drop in visits to Britain, but doubtless, there's a role in it for the tax, too.
I guess this is a case of passing the buck in the most literal of senses.
Don't cry for            Michael O'Leary ... he has a rockin' cheering section:

Airlines around the world are raking in the cash with extra fees, according to a new report.
In 2010, airlines generated almost $22 billion from ancillary revenues streams, including baggage fees, co-branded 
credit cards and premium club passes. That is a 775 percent increase from the $2.45 billion in ancillary revenue 
reported by airlines in 2007.
The newly-merged United Continental topped the globallist with $5 billion in ancillary revenue in 2010. Delta Air 
Lines (NYSE:DAL)  came in second with $3.7 billion while American Airlines (NYSE:AMR)  came in third with $1.95 
billion in extra fee revenue.
"Difficult airline economics are driving this activity," said Jay Sorensen, president of IdeaWorks Co. which authored 
the report. "Carriers can boost revenue through a la carte fees to balance damage brought by recession, new 
competitors, traveler demand for low fares - due to the culture prompted by low-cost airlines - and rising oil prices. 
Today, ancillary revenue has grown well beyond its low-cost airline beginnings and is practiced around the globe."
IdeaWorks, an airline and travel research firm in Wisconsin, partnered with global travel distribution company, 
Amadeus to put together the report. Amadeus sells software solutions to airlines and other travel firms to help them 
maximize their ancillary revenue streams.
Here's the top ten from 2010:
1. United Continental $5 billion
Extra fees generate $22 billion for airlines in 2010, new report says
2. Delta Air Lines $3.7 billion
3. American AIrlines $1.95 billion
4. Qantas Airways $1.53 billion
5. US Airways (NYSE:LCC)  $1.13 billion
6. Ryanair $1.13 billion
7. easyJet $926 million
8. Emirates $603 million
9. Alaska Airlines (NYSE:ALK)  $552 million
10. TAM Airlines $509 million

  May 29, 2011 (The Reality-Based Community delivered by Newstex) -- 
After a favorable EU ruling, the City of Maastricht            banned tourists from its cannabis cafes about six months 
ago.  As a border city, Maastricht was a magnet for drug tourism and most of the shops were not supported 
(economically or politically) by the local population.  I had assumed that such a step would not be taken in 
Amsterdam, but the city leadership has been overruled by the national government, which will            restrict 
cannabis access to Dutch citizens nationwide.   Some people are mystified that a country would take a step to 
reduce tourism, particularly during an economic downturn, so let me quote            an illuminating analysisby an 
obscure West Coast academic:
One might wonder why the Dutch would not want drug tourism, given that governments normally do their best to 
lure tourists to visit and to spend money. The coffee shop owners of course want drug tourists and the profits they 
bring. But the rest of community endures more costs than benefits.
The central problem with drug tourism is one of selection: People who will travel even an hour to use drugs are not 
a random sample of all drug users. The same principle applies to all those Brits who fly RyanAir to Spain for all-you-
can-drink weekend promotions at budget hotels, and the U.S. college kids on spring break who are drawn to similar 
offers in Mexico. Cannabis users as a population are not particularly prone to vandalism, disorderly conduct, and 
petty theft, but the subpopulation of users that will take a trip (no pun intended) for cannabis often commit these 
crimes, creating nuisance, distress and policing costs for locals.
A further cost to the country that attracts drug tourists is how more serious criminals respond. If you are a dealer in 
cocaine or ectstasy or methamphetamine, and you want to efficiently access a pool of probable customers, border 
towns with drug tourists are attractive bases of operations. There you will find many young men who are by 
definition unusually interested in using drugs and are away from whatever social constraints and norms surround 
them at home.

   May 23, 2011 (International Political Economy Zone delivered by Newstex) -- 
           Let me confess by that I live with the very embodiment of environmental evil. My flatmate is one of those 
Europeans who have taken advantage of the advent of low-cost carriers to travel around the continent affordably to 
see more of what it has to offer. This week Bratislava, the next Riga, maybe Prague in two weeks' time. This is so 
because certain environmentalists view short-hop flights as a unique form of devilry. When bus and train networks 
will take you pretty much anywhere you want to go, they argue, why fly Ryanair or EasyJet? Short-haul flights of the 
sort weekend vacationers like my flatmate take are said to be far worse in climate change terms than terrestrial 
transportation. Too, airports and the constant buzz of airplanes supposedly add to the noise pollution of already 
aurally challenging urban life. Living under a flight path, I certainly appreciate Icelandic volcanoes late in the 
evening!
So you have movements alike Plane Stupid here in the UK who spend their time fighting the expansion of major 
London airports alike            Heathrow and            Stansted. Recall the "           Battle of Heathrow" a few years 
back. Certainly the            potty-mouthed Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary regularly tossing f-bombs in the direction of 
the green crowd does nothing to endear himself to them.
But wait. Despite the endless enviro-pessimism of this crowd, they should find comfort in costly aviation fuel--not 
diminished European appetite to rediscover scenic towns across the continent via air travel--dooming Ryanair and 
Easyjet expansion. Earlier on, the            news was that Easyjet was now losing money, and that it did not plan to 
increase capacity for the first time ever:
Rising oil prices and aviation taxes have nearly doubled easyJet losses as the budget airline announced a freeze in 
fleet growth over the next two winters.
EasyJet admitted that consumers will not swallow the higher fares needed to offset higher costs, so aeroplanes will 
be parked in slower months to stem losses. The Luton-based carrier revealed the capacity squeeze as first-half pre-
tax losses, racked up during the traditionally quiet six months to 31 March, rose from £79m to £153m.
Maybe Costly Fuel Will Doom Low Cost Airlines
EasyJet highlighted the struggle for airlines to pass on soaring costs as revenue per seat slipped by 2.1%, which it 
attributed to a £1 increase in air passenger duty last autumn to £12 per flight. The near-doubling of losses was 
driven by a £43m impact from fuel, which now accounts for more than a quarter of the cost base, and a £21m hit 
from APD. EasyJet said it would hold its fleet size for its 2011 and 2012 winter programmes at 204 planes, while 
warning that it could change plans to grow its total fleet from 199 jets to 220 over the next two years.
Things are            no better for Ryanair. Aside from not making much money, it now plans to reduce flight capacity 
for the first time in its history. It is also thinking of a move upmarket as low-cost fares look to have run their course 
for now:
Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) will cut capacity for the first time in its history next winter as fuel costs threaten to 
render dozens of routes unprofitable, ending decades of growth that made it Europes No. 1 discount airline.
Ryanair fell the most in 20 months in Dublin trading after Chief Executive Officer Michael OLeary said hed ground 
80 of 300 jets and lay people off for the low season starting in October. Even with a 12 percent fare increase he 
forecasts net income no higher than last years 401 million euros ($563 million) -- or 18 percent less than estimated 
by analysts.
œIts the first time ever that well go negative on traffic, OLeary said in an interview. œWe take delivery of 50 aircraft 
this winter so instead of running around trying to open up new bases and routes in November and December well 
sit them on the ground. With higher oil prices it makes no sense.
Ryanair has transformed the European airline industry since OLeary took over in 1990 after studying the growth of 
Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV)  in the U.S., offering flights between cities never previously served by air and 
luring passengers from established carriers with bargain-basement fares and a no-frills service. More recently, the 
CEO signaled plans to attract higher-paying flyers after exhausting opportunities to lift sales by charging for 
everything from checked bags to credit-card bookings.
So there you go: costly fuel may do in short-haul flights so reviled by the environmental crowd in a manner that all 
sorts of protests have failed to achieve all these years. At least the charity calendar survives, eh?

   May 23, 2011 (The Business Insider delivered by Newstex) --
Theres been a lot of speculation as to who will be selected as the new editor of the            Irish Times. Paddy 
Power has a            convenient breakdown of the frontrunners which is impressively broad, ranging from print 
journalists to TV presenters. The next editor has a huge task. With the company            allegedly losing over ??1M 
each month, major change is urgently required. Here are five actions the new editor should think about:
1. Find a partner for Ireland.com
 If Ireland.com was a person, it would be a highly confused cross-dressing hermaphrodite. Notwithstanding the fact 
that its traffic appears to be decreasing, its totally unclear who it appears to be aimed at. Ireland.com is a great 
domain and it could be a great business if operated by the right company. Paddy Power, Ryanair or several others 
could potentially do something very interesting on a revenue-share basis.
2. Launch a daily deals site
 Yes I know everyones doing it. Yes, even            those guys. But in this case, its probably not a bad fit. No need to 
built anything-just partner with Groupon, LivingSocial or Boards Deals.
3. Start aggregating news
 I suspect I should tag this section ˜sacred cow slaughtering. If you look at the high growth news sites, theyre either 
built on other peoples content (e.g.            HuffPo and            Drudge) or pro-am journalism (e.g.            Storyful 
and            Storify). I think its time the Irish Times jumped onto this bandwagon. Is it a long-term fix? No. But it will 
start to drive traffic further and gives them a way to actually compete with the likes of            The Journal.
4. Put a paywall on the business section
 Do you know why the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times are able to make money online and so many other 
newspapers arent? Its because readers get their companies to pay for it rather than coming out of their own pocket. 
What should the Irish Times do next?
Its financial and business content after all so accountants grudgingly accept is as a valid expense. The Irish Times 
has a great            business section which can replicate this model in Ireland. Expand it, paywall it and target the 
people who can pay for it. Ill happily be customer number one.
5. Spin out the online group into a separate company
 Separating the print and online assets will give a lot more flexibility when it comes to negotiating salary cuts and 
redundancies. A new entity, devoid of the historic print overheads and liabilities, can not only raise capital in the 
private market, it can use its equity in place of cash as part of settlements and incentives.
I read the Irish Times online every day but Ive never encountered a serious effort to extract cash from my wallet. 
The company needs to get serious about monetization-we need their voice in Irelands media landscape.

   May 23, 2011 (Minyanville delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Stocks fell for a third straight week, technology shares especially hard hit as an 11% implosion in Hewlett-Packard 
(HPQ) outweighed the euphoria over LinkedIns (LNKD) 109% opening session surge. While the Dows devilish five 
day drop of 0.66% didnt actually presage            the end of the world, we may be about to endure an even worse 
fate. With Iceland once again erupting and Europes sovereign crisis stubbornly refusing to go away, history 
definitely isnt over -- rather, its            doomed to repeat. Given Fitch downgraded Greeces credit rating three 
notches, one wonders why Ms. Aniston is being urged to do the            till-debt-do-us-part thing with a native by her 
Papa. Mamma Mia meanwhile looks an even worse movie in retrospect -- not only was it shot on the Greek islands 
of Skopelos and Skiathos, but by donning a pair of Gap Inc (GPS) 
overalls on set, Meryl Streep proved investors would be better off sticking with the stock picking prowess of Merrill 
Lynch, the retailer sliding 17.48%            on Friday.
Among the continents other PIIGS, Italy -- whose            economy and            sex scandals eerily echo California 
and Arnie -- saw Standard & Poors reduce its outlook on the country from stable to negative on Saturday amid the 
œincreased fragility of Silvio Berlusconis coalition. And the appellation José -- a popular name in America            no 
longer -- suffered a further body blow when Mr. Bean lookalike José Luis Rodríguez Zapateros ruling Socialist Party 
suffered its steepest electoral losses in more than three decades over this weekend. On this side of the Atlantic,       
     our own president made millions due mainly to book royalties -- no surprise in a week when Barnes & Noble 
jumped 31.1%. And McDonalds (MCD) hit an all time high as one customer            ate his 25,000th Big Mac. 
Having retired from his job as a prison guard, at least he wont have to deal with Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Its all 
quiet on the economic calendar but todays earnings are expected to include Apollo Investment (AINV), Campbell 
Soup (CPB), GT Solar (SOLR), Krispy Kreme (KKD), Ryanair (RYAAY), and Tech Data (TECD).

The            McNulty Report on the railways is to be broadly welcomed. In particular, a greater emphasis on ticket 
prices that are market-related is crucial: this should be the starting point for any reform. Hence, the proposal for far 
more shoulder-type fares “ those applicable between peak and off-peak periods “ is eminently sensible. The aim 
should be to manage demand, via the pricing mechanism, so that trains operate at high capacity throughout the 
day. Both Ryanair and EasyJet have load factors of around 85% compared with the 50% figure applicable on the 
London-Birmingham railway line.
And why cannot more long-distance trains operate during the night, like airlines, offering ultra cheap fares which 
would free up more capacity at the most popular travelling times? Surely, many students would travel during the 
night time if the fares were extremely low. Compared to many overseas railways, which are heavily subsidised, UK 
railway tickets are undoubtedly expensive. In part, this is due to the excessive costs incurred by Network Rail “ a 
company in desperate need of restructuring “ that are passed onto rail franchise holders.
Every effort, therefore, should be made to tackle Network Rails bloated cost base and its soaring capital 
expenditure. Importantly, the adoption of these market-orientated policies would further weaken the poor financial 
case for HS2, which was highly unconvincing even before the DfTs recent sharp (8%+) cutback to its previous 
aggressive revenue growth assumptions.
Indeed, the DfTs economic case for HS2 seems now to rest heavily on the nebulous "non-monetised benefits, 
which underpin the strategic case for high-speed rail". Overall, in reforming the railways, the priority should be to let 
the market set rail ticket prices, with some back-up regulatory protection to prevent price-gouging. Getting that right 
- and also addressing Network Rails excessive costs - would give the UK railway a sensible financial base on which 
to grow.

   Apr. 28, 2011 (The Economist delivered by Newstex) --
I AM on the whole that rare thing: a fan of Ryanair. The budget airline usually gets you to your destination on time. 
The staff on board its flights are hard-working and efficient. And, of course, it's cheap, and passengers will put up 
with a lot for those low prices.
But I wonder whether the airline's latest ruse for getting passengers to spend more might not backfire. Checking in 
bags is not cheap, and many passengers will avoid it if they can. So Ryanair is not only, like its rivals, restricting 
passengers to one carry-on bag each (including handbags and any duty-free purchases), it is limiting this to 10 kilos 
and has started to police this vigorously. So, for example, at Stansted a team of Ryanair staff now stop passengers 
making their way to the gate to weigh their bags. And at small airports such as Béziers Cap d'Agde in France every 
carry-on bag is weighed.
The inevitable result is a lot of petty inconvenience (passengers forced to stuff handbags into wheelies for weighing, 
even when they're obviously within the weight limit) and plenty of waste (a bag of pasta jettisoned to avoid paying 
35 euros for an overweight bag), as well as some extra revenue at the expense of extra customer irritation. But the 
real problem is that it turns Ryanair's ground staff into baggage police who treat each passenger as a suspected 
rule-breaker rather than someone to help to their flight. In my own case yesterday, the staff were so focused on 
weighing my bag (which was within the 10-kilo limit) that they failed to notice that I was heading to the wrong flight.
British Airways made the mistake a few years ago of turning check-in staff into a row of petty officials whose first 
mission seemed to be to argue with passengers over their carry-on bags. BA eventually realised this was a fine way 
to lose customers, and changed policy. Ryanair may reckon that its customers will not be too bothered because 
what they really care about is the price of the ticket. We'll see.

Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft is launching an office in Brussels with the hire of Linklaters competition partner 
Alec Burnside.
Burnside (pictured), who has been recruited with a remit to open and manage the new office, specialises in EU 
competition law and regularly advises on high-profile cases involving global industries, governments and bluechip 
corporations.
Recent deals he has worked on include Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT)  acquisition of Yahoo's search function, Aer 
Lingus's successful defence of Ryanair's hostile takeover bids, and Deutsche Borse's pending merger with NYSE 
Euronext. (NYSE:NYX)
Burnside's departure leaves the magic circle firm's Brussels base with four competition partners. The office is 
headed up by the firm's global head of antitrust Gerwin Van Gerven.
Cadwalader chairman Christopher White commented: "Alec is recognised as one of the leading competition lawyers 
in Europe. His attraction to Cadwalader and our investment in him and the opening of an office in Brussels reflect a 
mutual commitment to fielding the finest global antitrust team practising today."
Cadwalader antitrust chief Rick Rule added: "To be able to bring on board a solicitor of the calibre of Alec Burnside 
is a game-changer for our global antitrust group."

Aer Lingus Wants to be a Provider of Seats, Let Others Do the Rest

   Apr. 12, 2011 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) --
As usual, there was great discussion at the Phoenix Aviation Symposium last week, but one in particular grabbed 
me.  Steven Kavanagh, Chief Commercial Officer for Aer Lingus in Ireland has an interesting way of looking at his 
airline.  He wants to be œan expert at producing seats and then make that a platform for others to peddle their 
wares.  Its a view that certainly isnt shared industry-wide, but for an airline in Aer Linguss position, it probably 
makes sense.
This piece of the discussion came up during a back and forth about inflight internet.  Steven argued that airlines 
shouldnt have to pay to install internet at all and that the internet company should take all the risk.  In his mind, Aer 
Lingus has a captive audience of people on the airplane and other companies, like internet providers, should pay a 
price to be able to have access to those people.  So internet would be installed at the providers expense and in 
addition, a small royalty would be given to the airline for each sale.  The bulk of the revenue goes to the internet 
provider.
You could repeat this with all kinds of products and services.  Meals?  Sure.  Inflight shopping?  Why not?  
Entertainment options?  Yep.  Its an interesting way of looking at what an airline does.  I imagine the view is colored 
by the fact that Aer Lingus has tremendous competition from Ryanair on nearly all its short haul routes.  Its tough to 
compete with those guys, but this kind of model lends itself well to that effort. 
Of course, this biggest issue here is one of branding consistency.  If you use this model, youre going to be offering 
all different kinds of brands on top of your brand and the message can be muddled.  That might not be an issue for 
Aer Lingus or other carriers where brand isnt considered that important.  After all, people make choices based 
primarily on schedule and price, right?  So if Aer Lingus has a good fare at the right time (and it runs an on time 
airline), then it may think its got the idea right.
Aer Lingus Wants to be a Provider of Seats, Let Others Do the Rest
Others, however, disagree.  Take a look at Southwest, for example.  Gogo inflight internet has a model thats 
somewhat similar to what Steven suggests.  That company handles the pricing and takes on some of the risk.  They 
also brand the service as Gogo.  Southwest hates that idea, and thats one of the main reasons it opted to go with a 
different provider, Row 44.  It wanted to control the experience and have it branded as Southwest.  Southwest 
wants to own the entire customer experience; the opposite of what Aer Lingus proposes.
Part of that may be that Southwest has one of the better brands out there (despite the recent problem of holes in 
737s), so it wants to cultivate it and protect it.  Opening the airline up to look similar to an app store for your mobile 
phone doesnt work for that purpose.
But even those airlines that like this model only like it when it benefits them.  Lets say, for example, that Expedia 
(NASDAQ:EXPE)  pitches itself as a provider of travelers who want to book tickets and that if you want access to 
those travelers, you have to pay for placement.  This is exactly the opposite of what American has suggested 
should happen.  American has said that maybe Expedia and others should pay for the privilege of having their 
information available for the customers.  Its the opposite argument.  Something tells me that well only hear this 
argument when it means airlines dont have to spend money.
In the end, this strategy isnt right or wrong in general.  Its an airline-specific thing.  And for Aer Lingus, which 
competes hard with low fare airline Ryanair, it probably makes sense.  But it does come at the expense of the 
brand.

So the            truth is out, Downing Street didnt tip Guido off and send him the snap of the Camerons waiting glumly 
at Stansted Gate 48 for their flight. Fellow Ryanair traveller Beckett Fish took the snap on his iPhone and put it on 
Facebook. His friend Mark Edwards saw the pictures on Facebook and sent them to Guido, who was in a            
Soho pub when he received the picture on his Android phone. A bit squiffy Guido still managed to blog the picture 
via phone in the pub. Then all hell broke loose.
Lobby hacks on Twitter immediately reckoned it was the best publicity Cameron has seen in months, they 
speculated it was planted by Downing Street. Hacks were on the phone immediately to Guido chasing the story. 
Hastily Guido agreed a deal with Beckett and Mark via email. By the time Guido left the pub we had agreed a 
worldwide picture syndication deal and sold the picture to half of Londons newspapers. We sold it to the BBC and 
Sky as well. It was all over the            front pages the next day.
The idea that Downing Streets new spinner Craig Oliver arranged all this is a flight of fantasy. It was down to good 
old fashioned luck and fast thinking. Usually Guidos co-conspirators get a T-shirt for a really good tip, Mark and 
Beckett are looking to get more than enough cash for another holiday. Readers make this blog what it is: the blog 
you love and they hate¦

At the beginning of the week Oliver Letwin put his foot in his mouth, again, telling Boris Johnson that: œWe dont 
want more people from Sheffield flying away on cheap holidays. It looked like a disastrously out of touch gaffe as 
millions of œsqueezed middle swing voters prepare to go on their cheap annual holiday away from austerity. David 
Cameron inadvertently provided the perfect rebuttal by flying away on a cheap Ryanair flight. On Thursday this 
blogs readers saw him pictured with Sam looking grumpy in a way that fellow cattle class travellers will recognise. 
 On Friday it was front page news around the world¦ 
Political hacks agreed it was the best PR Cameron had got in months. Sceptical media cynics reckoned it was too 
good to be true and that it was a Downing Street inspired photo-op, BBC and Sky hacks speculated that it was a 
set-up and even admired the cleverness of the user-generated-content style camera phone shot. Somewhat 
flattering Craig Olivers abilities¦

SWOT Analysis, is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and 
Threats involved in a project or in a business venture. It involves specifying the objective of the business venture or 
project and identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving that 
objective.
The aim of any SWOT analysis is to identify the key internal and external factors that are important to achieving the 
objective. SWOT analysis groups key pieces of information into two main categories:
Internal factors  The strengths and weaknesses internal to the organization. 
External factors  The opportunities and threats presented by the external environment.
The internal factors may be viewed as strengths or weaknesses depending upon their impact on the organization's 
objectives. What may represent strengths with respect to one objective may be weaknesses for another objective. 
The factors may include all of the 4P's; as well as personnel, finance, manufacturing capabilities, and so on. The 
external factors may include macroeconomic matters, technological change, legislation, and socio-cultural changes, 
as well as changes in the marketplace or competitive position. The results are often presented in the form of a 
matrix.

That            bacon flavored air supposedly wafting around at the moment might only be an April Fools joke but for a 
couple little PIIGS, the aroma this afternoon did undeniably contain the sweet smell of success. Dublin duo Allied 
Irish Banks plc (AIB) and Bank of Ireland (IRE) duked it out for the distinction of being their countrys best 
performing big financial stock today. Granted some may say thats a decidedly dubious honor, akin to being the 
worlds tallest leprechaun, but few can quibble with respective share price increases of 20.42% and 22.29%. The 
sharp upward moves on what are admittedly still beleaguered and perilously low-priced stocks comes after stress 
tests of the nations banking sector revealed it requires an additional ??24 billion ($34 billion) in cash, in addition to 
structural overhaul.
Yusuf Heusen, a senior sales trader at Londons IG Index, wrote in a note that œConsensus seems to be that theres 
little to fear for the consequences of the stress tests on Irish banks. Skeptics have argued that similar continental 
stress tests have previously been suspiciously easy to pass, but today at least the market appears to be relieved by 
the removal of an element of uncertainty. For Bank of Ireland, the Emerald Isles largest lender, investors are 
applauding its intention to escape the governments grasp by raising ??5.2 billion ($7.4 billion) in additional capital.
The ruling party also announced restructuring plans which would make Allied Irish and Bank of Ireland the countrys 
two biggest banks, a move long suffering bondholders have also widely welcomed. This onetime ˜Celtic tiger has 
suffered through a real rough time of it in recent years and insult was added to injury when Merrill Lynch, long 
known as the ˜Irish mafia on Wall Street, effectively sent its taxpayers a ??106 billion bill in property-related losses. 
(Click here for Michael Lewis gripping account.) Ireland is overdue a change of luck but lost in todays euphoria was 
the news of another sovereign-debt downgrade by Standard and Poors, the third ratings agency to do so. With both 
banks' shares still down about 80% in the past year even after todays surge, it may yet be a bit premature to break 
open the piggy bank.

Swisher Hygiene
Irelands best known businessman, Ryanair (RYAAY) CEO Michael OLeary, is apparently deadly serious in his 
plans to charge passengers a            fee to pee. But based on todays solid 3.66% increase in shares of Swisher 
Hygiene, Inc. (SWSH), he may make more money by investing in this Charlotte, North Carolina based provider of 
sanitation solutions. The 25-year old company offers assorted facility services, including restroom bowl, urinal, and 
sink cleaning, in addition to germicide application and restocking of air-fresheners and soap dispensers. Its a dirty 
job but a nation of neurotics is extremely grateful someone is doing it. (The œpinky pull doorhandle technique 
employed by            public restroom germaphobes once even made it all the way to page one of The Wall Street 
Journal.)
Swisher, which also offers rental and cleaning of floor mats and mops, operates via 78 either company-owned or 
franchised outfits in the US and Canada and serves industries including foodservice, hospitality, and healthcare. 
Todays increase, which at one point made it one of the Nasdaqs top 25 performing stocks on a percentage basis, 
followed an announcement they are acquiring Tennessee-based based Linen Services Plus. Steven R. Berrard, 
CEO of Swisher, said œWe continue to gear up our presence in the linen, warewash, and laundry markets and the 
purchases are another step in rounding out our full service coverage. No less a of heavyweight investor than H. 
Wayne Huizenga certainly isnt throwing in the towel on Swisher, having acquired a majority interest in November 
2004.

Office Depot
Like Swisher, Office Depot, Inc. (ODP) was founded in 1986 and its shares certainly went down the toilet this 
afternoon. On a day the Dow hit a high for the year, this Boca-based business supply powerhouse nosedived 
9.07% after announcing the restatement of 2010 financial results following an Internal Revenue Service rejection of 
its claim for an $80 million tax benefit. Accordingly the specialty retailer will now swing to a steep loss of $46 million, 
or $0.30 on an EPS basis, from last years previously reported $33 million profit. Investors are in an unforgiving fool-
me-once mode -- something similar occurred at the company in 2007 -- and S&P equity research promptly cut their 
price target by a steep $1.50 to $3.50 on the sell rated stock, which was already underwater to the tune of about 
40% in the past 52-weeks amid a still-sluggish macroeconomic environment.
Chief Financial Officer Mike Newman admitted œwe are disappointed by the development and added that the 
restatement will adversely impact first-quarter 2011 operating cash flow. For a firm which once passed up an ad 
that showed            disorganization at work, Office Depot (NYSE:ODP)  may need to get its own house in order.
Logitech International
Those good folks at Guinness (DEO) have spent their time this week trying to ascertain whether Smokey the cat, 
whose            purr has been recorded at a Boeing-beating (NYSE:BA) 92 decibels, is the worlds loudest. (Maybe 
the market is premature in saying Ireland is out of of the woods after all, based its on lost productivity alone.) Well, 
at least we now know why the feline was so content; the worlds biggest maker of mice made for easy prey today. 
Logitech International SA (LOGI), which also makes assorted other computer peripherals, wireless devices, and 
digital gadgets, imploded 18.86%. This after our            headline downgrade lowered its outlook for fiscal 2011 
operating income to the range of $140 million to $150 million, down from previous guidance of $170 million to $180 
million. Sales forecasts have also been cut to between $2.35 billion to $2.37 billion, again well off prior expectations 
of $2.40 billion to $2.42 billion and also shy of Street estimates of $2.41 billion.
Irish Banks Are Back In The Green
Such a preannouncement is highly unusual from the Apline outfit, which is normally run with the efficiency of a 
Swiss watch. The company referenced sluggish demand in its European retail segment as a reason for the shortfall. 
March is also invariably a seasonally weak quarter for margins, compounding the problem. One small sliver for 
optimists to cling to is that there does not appear to be any cannibalization occuring in tablets.

Ryanair is unhappy that it has to pay compensation under EU rules to people who are canceled or delayed even if it 
isnt the airlines fault.  So, it has introduced a ??2 compensation levy on all bookings.  Some say its awful that 
Ryanair is charging a fee just to compensate people if something goes wrong.  Others applaud Ryanair for 
highlighting the tremendous cost of a rule that may not make sense.  What do you think?
And yes, I realize today is April Fools Day, but this aint no joke.

 New York, March 31st (TradersHuddle.com) - The NYSE Airline index ended the session lower by closing at 
$43.07, which represents -0.96% versus its previous day close. The airline index saw a broad decline with 2 out of 
12 airlines trading higher.
Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) was the top performer of the sector today closing at $27.8 representing 0.36%. versus 
the previous trading session. Shares of Ryanair, the low fare European airline have defined support at $26.21 and 
resistance at $27.60.
Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (NYSE:GOL) was also among the top performers, closed the trading session at 
$13.73 representing -0.07% from its previous close. Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes, the low fare Brazilian domestic 
airline has calculated support and resistance levels at $12.56 and $13.84 respectively. The other top performer was 
Lan Airlines (NYSE:LFL)  (NYSE:LFL), which closed the trading session at $25.59 representing -0.35% from the 
previous trading session.
The sector's worst performers include AMR (NYSE:AMR) that closed the trading session at $6.46 or -5.69% from 
the previous close. Shares of AMR, the owner and operator of the 2nd largest U.S. based airline and founding 
member of the Oneworld airline alliance have defined support at $6.34 and resistance at $6.74. Also among the

the previous trading session.
Benchmark crude for May delivery was higher closing the trading session at $106.59 a barrel on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange higher by $2.32 from the previous trading session. Crude prices are closely watched by 
traders as they usually correlate with the airline stocks, given that a big component of the airlines' cost structure is 
covered by the price of fuel.

Nothing new to this blog's readers, but Booker            has a go at the "increasingly surreal state of our public 
finances", as highlighted by several events last week, not least the Budget. There, those who could stomach 
listening to the preposterous Osborne, will recall that he claimed he was intended to encourage growth in the 
economy while continuing to remedy the hole in our bank balance created by the last government's reckless 
overspending.
Yet, despite the general impression that the Cleggerons are cutting back on public spending -- as Channel 4's Jon 
Snow put it, we are facing the most severe cuts since World War Two -- the budget revealed that our spending will 
in fact increase even faster than we were told it would last October.
In the small print of last year's spending review, little George told us that annual spending was due to rise from 
£696 billion to £739 billion in four years' time. In the small print of last week's Budget, spending is projected to rise 
from £694 billion this year to £743.6 billion in 2014-15, an increase of some £50 billion. That, of course, makes it 
even more bizarre that we should be throwing money at the Libyan adventure, to which effect Booker brings up the 
issue of the million-pound Storm Shadow missiles.
That invites a rather entertaining comment that "Baroness" Ashton's remuneration and pension package, servants, 
cars, homes and expenses, amount to about £1m per annum, same as the missile. Why don't we drop her on the 
Libyans?
If we could then enlist the RAF to drop off the 500,000 or so who were demonstrating against the "cuts" yesterday, 
then we might at last have found something useful for the junior service to do -- even if Ryanair could probably do it 
cheaper.

 I fly back from Rome to LA tomorrow. I have been in "old Europe" for 2.5 weeks now and it is now time to return.   
My mind is clear and I'm eager to get back to work again.  I owe work for several co-authors and I apologize for 
being a bum.    To reduce academic leisure, I propose that everyone's tenure should be revoked and we should all 
have to earn our privileges again.
My dad always asks me; "what have you learned recently son?"  So,  What have I learned in Europe?
1. In Maastricht, Holland -- the people are tall and the food is good.  You will not find a Starbucks there. If you look 
for coffee at a "Koffee House" you will meet drugged out dudes eager to sell you "weed".  I didn't buy any.
2.  There are many places to buy beer in Maastricht and the beer is good.
3.  Maastricht University has many serious economists and I greatly enjoyed talking to them.   You should read the 
work of Piet Eichholtz and            Nils Kok.
At the Green Real Estate Conference, I talked and talked some more.  Several of my U.S friends were there (Max 
Auffhammer, Erin Mansur, Howard Chong,  Dwight Jaffee, John Quigley,  Grant Jacobson) and old friends such as 
Henry Overman and Yongheng Deng were also participating in the conference.    My favorite wife was also in 
attendance and without our son around we had the chance to talk to each other.  We had dinner together in a cave 
in an old Castle and we drank a lot of high quality wine.
4.  The International Herald Tribune is a pretty good newspaper.
A Return to Los Angeles (the March 2011 Version)
5. There is an airline called "Ryanair" and I don't fit into their seats.  When the plane lands, they play a celebration 
bugle that matches the sound of the start of a horse race and everyone on the plane cheers that they are safe and 
alive.  Pretty strange!
6.  At European airports, there is no gate for loading you into the plane; you disembark from a steep staircase that I 
was worried I would slip on.
We miss Los Angeles.  I miss the modern showers and the smells of Spring but I am a big fan of Europe and hope 
to return soon.
For my friends at UCLA who actually expect that I will do what I promised I would do (and I can't remember what I 
promised to do),  I will be very busy the next couple of months.  I am refreshed and ready to work very hard again.

   Mar. 18, 2011 (TradersHuddle.com delivered by Newstex) --
 New York, March 18th (TradersHuddle.com) - Unusual high volume detected on shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC 
(OOTC:RYAOF)  (NASDAQ:RYAAY)  (           NASDAQ:RYAAY), early in the trading session. Ryanair is currently 
trading higher by 1.58%, so definitely the buyers stepping in, as the stock's volume is on pace to break its average.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair has already traded 0.765 times its 3-month average volume, and has calculated support and resistance at 
$26.21 and $31.50 respectively. Traders like to use volume as their lie detector for price action moves through 
predefined trading ranges.
The overall market index S&P 500 is trading higher by 0.81% from its previous trading close, which means that 
Ryanair stock is outperforming the overall market.

When budget airline mogul Tony Ryan finished his $140M renovation of Lyon Demesne, a 600-acre estate and 
1785 Georgian manor house (above), he probably wasn't keen on his rowdy compatriots holding their drunken St. 
Patrick's Day festivities on the property. Sadly, Ryan passed away in 2007 and his sons            put the immaculate 
mansion up for sale. With no takers at the initial $112M price, the brothers            trimmed it down to a slightly more 
accessible $70M. But, while $42M buys a lot of green beer, we thought we'd find some Irish country houses that 
don't require a billionaire's budget and could host a shamrock shindig without spoiling too much. 
?' In the village of Ashford, 40 minutes from downtown Dublin, lies Glanmore Castle, once the home of playwright 
John Millington Synge. The castle has now been divided into smaller homes and the prominent central tower is now 
for sale at $1.295M. Combining modern technology with classic details, the castle has solar panels on the roof. 
Despite the traditional Irish form, the four-bedroom castle loses points for its single bathroom.
?' The listing for Rathangan Lodge is short on interior photos,            suggesting a full renovation would probably be 
necessary, but the 1740 stone hunting lodge, built for the Earl of Leinster, boasts 11,000 square feet of interior 
space, perfect for a massive pre-renovation party. There are 33 rooms in total and four acres of land close to the 
village of Rathangan Town. $1.2M buys the chance to tackle a Tony Ryan-style renovation.

?' For those in need of a more privacy for their St. Patty's soiree, Phillipstown Manor boasts over 1,400 acres, but, 
much like Rathangan Lodge, requires a complete interior renovation. The stately facade and gorgeous country 
views should soften the pain of a $2.7M fixer-upper.

 New York, March 15th (TradersHuddle.com) - Unusual high volume detected on shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC 
(OOTC:RYAOF)  (NASDAQ:RYAAY)  (           NASDAQ:RYAAY), early in the trading session. Ryanair is currently 
trading lower by 2.73%, so definitely the sellers in control, as the stock's volume is on pace to break its average.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair has already traded 0.897 times its 3-month average volume, and has calculated support and resistance at 
$28.21 and $31.50 respectively. Traders like to use volume as their lie detector for price action moves through 
predefined trading ranges.
The overall market index S&P 500 is trading lower by -1.89% from its previous trading close, which means that 
Ryanair stock is underperforming the overall market.

   Mar. 9, 2011 (The Business Insider delivered by Newstex) --
MILLIONS OF HOLIDAYMAKERS “ including thousands of Irish “ could see  their holiday plans ruined after staff in 
Spanish airports announced a  series of strikes from April to July.
The scheduled walkouts “  which are set to begin on April 20, and continue well into the peak  holiday season in 
July “ involves around 12,500 ground staff employed by  the state-owned airport authority, Aena.
They are walking out in  protest at state plans to privatise the authority, which could see many  of them lose their 
jobs, the Daily Telegraph reports.
The impact of  the strike action could spread further, the Telegraph adds, if the  countrys air traffic controllers joined 
in the actions “ because  flights to Portugal and Morocco would also be affected, given they  travel through Spanish 
airspace.
Airports in the Canary Islands  and the Balearic Islands are also affected by the proposed action.
Ryanair  said the action “ if it was to ultimately take place “ would see it  cancel around 300 flights over the Easter 
period, affecting the plans of  57,000 passengers across its European operations.
Chief executive  Michael OLeary            has called on the European Union to intervene in  the dispute, saying its 
effects stretch far beyond Spanish borders.
Spanish Airport Workers Plan Massive Series Of Strikes During Peak Travel Season
           The Independent reports, however, that the  disruption will not mean an immediate government response; 
when similar  wildcat strikes took place last year, the government indicated it would  not look favourably on any 
action intended to disrupt its vital tourism  industry.e
The 22 various day-long stoppages are led by three  trade unions which are opposed to the part-privatisation of the 
airport  authority, a move that            Reuters believes could raise as much as ??30bn for  the state.
The dates specified for the strikes are 20, 21, 24, 25  and 30 April; 2, 14, 15, 19 and 20 May; 13, 23 and 30 June; 1, 
2, 3, 4,  15 and 31 July; and 1, 15 and 31 August.

   Mar. 6, 2011 (International Political Economy Zone delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Turning and returning to some secret place to hide
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say
Take my breath away...
           OK, so L.A.-based 80s synthpop / New Wave band Berlin has little to do with their titular city aside from the 
name. The band's greatest hits (like its Top Gun            theme) came before the Berlin Wall collapsed. Now, 
though, beneficiaries of the Iron Curtain's demise are complaining that tourists are literally taking their breath away. 
Unbeknownst to many, Berlin is Europe's third largest tourist destination for overnight stays after Paris and London. 
And so the complaints rain down: We are being overrun by foreigners, punks, weirdos, etc. To use a regrettable 
term, some Berlin residents seek living space away from the travelling hordes. Like many others, this occurrence is 
another story of globalization. Whereas the European travel market was once dominated by national carriers 
charging higher air fares, low-cost airlines like (Greek) 
EasyJet and (Irish)            RyanAir have revolutionized the industry by standardizing planes, minimizing frills, and 
using secondary airports to offer bus fare-like rates. My Italian flatmate, for instance, flies out to visit different 
European cities three weekends each month.
           Some Europeans tend to be snobbish about tourists. From constantly bugging locals for directions to 
crowding out local transportation, there's always some minor gripe to be heard. As an IPE fiend, I happen to be in 
the minority that realizes the benefits of tourism for local industry and welcomes travellers unreservedly. Migration is 
a right of all peoples--read the Universal Declaration on Human Rights if you're in doubt. So, let people roam where 
they wish to provided they put some towards respecting local rules and customs. But it appears not everyone is 
happy about these events happening in Europe. The denizens of Berlin's Kreuzberg district, for instance, are            
crying foul:

œHelp, the tourists are coming was the name of a gathering organized recently by the Green party in Kreuzburg. 
The turnout was good - over 120 people squeezed into a hall to talk about what they should do about the tourists 
who many long-time residents say are ruining the neighbourhood.
The bogeymen in their eyes have a profile: They are young and hail from England [yobs?], Sweden, or maybe Italy. 
In the morning they rattle sleeping residents out of their beds as they drag trolley suitcases over the cobblestones 
on their way to catch an early Ryanair flight. At night, they disturb the peace with loutish, alcohol-fuelled behaviour, 
littering the sidewalks with broken beer bottles and vomit. œWere not a zoo, said one young man in low-hanging 
jeans and a hoodie. œTourists need to head over to Alex or Kudamm, he added, referring to Alexanderplatz and 
Kurfürstendamm, two areas which have traditionally been main tourist magnets in the German capital.
But things are changing. The one-time alternative neighbourhood was once best known for its squats, drop-outs, 
punks and immigrants, not to mention the annual May Day demonstrations where leftists square off against police. 
But Kreuzberg is now firmly on the itinerary of many tourists, alongside the Brandenburg Gate and the TV Tower. 
With its many bars and clubs, hip reputation and cheap prices for accommodation and beer, Kreuzberg has become 
a prime destination for the low-cost-airline set.
It seems complains mirror those from the time of Berlin (the band). In addition, the practice of informal hotelling 
(think            Crashpadder or            Airbnb) is upsetting those in the formal sector:
œIve lived in Kreuzberg for 20 years, was a refrain often heard at the meeting, although it was hard to know 
whether people were angrier about the neighbourhood losing some of its gritty edge or at the techno blasting away 
in the all-night, open-air clubs along the Spree River. Indeed, some of the complaints by the self-styled œalternative 
crowd were reminiscent of the objections voiced by Swabian villagers upset at local punk shows in the 1980s...
There is also a thriving black-market hotel sector, which has the Berlin government concerned. Those are 
apartments that are regularly rented out by the day, week or month to young tourists or foreign students. The 
practice, while illegal because the owners lack the proper permits, is very popular. œBerlin has become the capital 
of the holiday rental, according to Burkhard Kieker, head of the city marketing agency, who said the trend pushes 
rents up and makes apartments scarce.
But the situation is unlikely to change any time soon, especially as Berlin keeps breaking its own record for tourist 
visits each year. In 2010, according to the citys tourist office, there were more than 21 million overnight stays and 
the total number of visitors topped 9 million, an increase of 9.5 percent over 2009. There are currently 112,000 hotel 
beds in the city; another 15,000 are planned...
œCity policy has simply been overwhelmed by all the development, admitted Gerhard Buchholz from the citys 
tourist board. But city authorities arent likely to discourage tourists from going to Kreuzberg or any other 
neighbourhood, despite complaints from locals. Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit is a big backer of the citys tourism 
sector, since industry-poor Berlin has few other sources of revenue. Tourism adds about ??9 billion to city coffers 
every year.
According to marketing chief Kieker, the Kreuzberg protests are overwrought and residents should be proud rather 
than annoyed that visitors from all over Europe come to experience something of the lives Kreuzbergers get to live 
every day. The neighbourhood has become a central part of Berlin, he said, instead of remaining the niche place it 
used to be. But it appears that for many long-term residents, living in that niche was just fine.
This problem is one I am sure most other cities would love. Having too many visitors! From where I come from, that 
would be worth putting up some inconvenience with. I suppose stricter zoning regulations can help overall, but still--
you may not know how good you've got it till its gone. In the wisdom of Berlin...
Through the hourglass I saw you 
In time you slipped away
EasyJet Takes Yer Breath Away: Berlin v Tourists
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today--I am unafraid

Which airline operates more Boeing (NYSE:BA)  737s than any other carrier? Why, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) 
, of course, with nearly 550 in its fleet.
But Southwest doesn't operate the Boeing 737-800, the most popular version of the next-generation Boeing 737. 
Southwest has 20 on order, but those aircraft don't begin arriving until next year.
Our question this week: Name the airline that operates more Boeing 737-800s than any other carrier in the world.
Answer below.
Answer: Dublin-based Ryanair, which just took delivery of its 300th Boeing 737-800.

   Feb. 21, 2011 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) --
London is one dizzyingly well-connected city, uniquely positioned as a hub for air travel around Europe and beyond. 
The city has five airports--Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton, and London City--six if you count tiny Southend. In 
2010, over 127 million passengers were carried through these airports. By way of contrast, Paris, the next biggest 
city in Europe in terms of passenger numbers, saw 83 million people pass through its two airports in 2010.
With this post, Gadling launches a new series designed to call attention to London as a launchpad for travel around 
Europe and beyond--from daytrip locations just outside the borders of Greater London to destinations as far afield 
as Dubai. We'll provide an overview of transportation options and also provide a budget-minded navigation of each 
destination.
First up: Oslo.
Several airlines fly from two London airports to Oslo. From London Heathrow, British Airways and SAS fly to Oslo-
Gardermoen, the city's main airport. From London Gatwick, Norwegian Air Shuttle flies to Oslo-Gardermoen and 
Ryanair flies to Oslo-Rygge, a secondary airport south of the city. When I searched for fares on Kayak, Ryanair's 
flights to Oslo-Rygge were cheapest, though I decided against this option in order to avoid having to deal with the 
lengthy transit time between the center of Oslo and Oslo-Rygge.
The cheapest flight I found to Oslo-Gardemoen was flown by Norwegian Air Shuttle, a Norwegian low-cost airline 
with good reach across Europe and an especially strong network throughout Scandinavia. My flight ran £95.60 
($153). I booked it just six days prior to departure.
My accommodation, organized through airbnb, cost me $152 for two nights. The $76 nightly charge breaks down as 
follows: $68 for the room plus a $16 airbnb service fee. Budget watchers will observe that I've spent $305 before 
arriving in Oslo.
My accommodation via airbnb amounts to one of the cheapest beds in Oslo, though single rooms at            
Ellingsens Pensjonat, the least expensive Oslo guesthouse I came across during research, are cheaper at 400 
NOK ($70) per night.
Launchpad London maiden journey: Midweek jaunt to Oslo
Bargain-hunters can find relatively low rates in private accommodation. Rooms in private homes can be booked at 
the train station tourist office on the day of requested accommodation. These rooms begin at around 300 NOK 
($53) per night, and there are dozens of private Oslo rooms on offer depending on season.
Want more options?            Bed & Breakfast Norway lists the following accommodations with single rooms available 
for under 400 NOK per night: the centrally-located            Den Blå Dør for 400 NOK ($70) and            Enerhaugen 
for 370 NOK ($65); and            Ambiose Bed & Breakfast for 370 NOK ($65) and Bed & Breakfast Poppe for 250 
NOK ($44), both of which are located on the outskirts of Oslo. During the summer, camping is another budget-
friendly accommodation option. From June 1 through September 1, sites for one or two people can be booked at       
     Ekeberg Camping's Oslo City Camp starting at 180 NOK ($32) per night.

The Costa del Sol lazily stretches out along the southern Mediterranean coast of Spain. Not really committing to the 
industrious ambitions of            Barcelona or            Madrid, the coast is a land of perpetual siesta, where work 
orders are responded to with a simple "manana," and beaches gradually disappear into salty azure waters. It is the 
kind of place that convertibles were invented for.
To tackle it in 3 days would be a shame, but better than having not visited at all. To really cover the ground

 New York, February 14th (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (OOTC:RYAOF)  
(NASDAQ:RYAAY)  (           NASDAQ:RYAAY) ended the trading session higher by $0.41 or 1.38% from its 
previous close. Ryanair's price action formed what is considered to be a bullish engulfing candle that could very 
well signal continuation of trend or reversal on ongoing weakness.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's recent stock range has been formed by a trough where calculated support was defined at $28.60 and by 
a peak that established the resistance level at $31.50, which could be used by traders planning their trades.
Traders wanting to establish a position in Ryanair or traders that are already holding the stock can use the bullish 
engulfing pattern to their advantage. The pattern provides a defined risk as it shows where the bears were able to 
push the stock down, before the bulls stepped in.
The bullish engulfing pattern is a leading indicator that provides an alert to the bulls that the trend will continue or 
that there is an immediate reversal to the short term weakness seen on the stock. Below an Engulfing Bullish

   Feb. 10, 2011 (The Business Insider delivered by Newstex) --
Following a baggage fee dispute earlier this week that resulted in 100  Belgian students being kicked off a Ryanair 
flight, the budget airline  released a statement accompanied by a Youtube video which demonstrates             the 
proper way to pack a carry-on bag.
In the statement, the carrier suggested that Belgian universities add  the lesson to their curriculum œfollowing the 
unacceptable and unsafe  behavior of over 100 Belgian students last Saturday in Lanzarote.
The tongue-in-cheek video, which is set to the Benny Hill theme song,  shows a traveler impressively packing 
enough clothes for a two-week  vacation into one 10kg carry-on bag.

Tropea, Italy, February 08, 2011 “(PR.com)“ After centuries of isolation from the rest of the Italian mainland and 
Europe at large, the Southern Italian region Calabria is getting increasingly connected as the rest of the world finds 
out about its unique qualities such as its 800km stunning coastline, outstanding beaches, picturesque villages and 
the generally low prices and year round sunny, warm climate.
In 2011 the Airport of Sant Eufemia Lamezia Terme (SUF) in Calabria becomes a hub for Ryanair making the 
region accessible to low cost travellers from as far as Stockholm in Sweden, London in the UK, Brussels in 
Belgium, Dusseldorf in Germany and Barcelona in Spain. The domestic links in 2011 are Lamezia to Bergamo 
(Milan), Bologna, Pisa and Trapani.
Other popular routes are the seasonal flights with Air Transat from Toronto and the charter flights from Moscow.
"International property specialist InCalabria are well prepared," says Dennis Onstenk, the owner. "InCalabria is 
specialised in international direct marketing of Calabria property at competitive prices. In our central Tropea office in 
Italy our international team of consultants help buyers find the ideal property to suit their personal needs. We then 
assist in all matters concerning the purchase “ we are known to provide the best service in the business". The 
company currently has property on its books starting at Euro79.000 for a one bedroom apartment and Euro106.000 
for a two bedroom apartment.
InCalabria and their peers can look forward to a busy year as people from the United Kingdom and Northern 
Europe seek an escape from the doom and gloom and cold, dark winter months without breaking the bank.
They may just find it in sunny and affordable Calabria.

Over hundred passengers mutinied a Ryanair flight from the Spanish Canary Islands when several passengers 
were asked to pay a fee for outsized carry-on luggage, as they were boarding the flight.
One male passenger, who was traveling with other Belgian college students, refused to pay then was denied 
access on to the plane.  Thats when his other traveling companions rushed the tarmac and mutinied the flight.  
Spanish police were called to calm the situation, eventually removing all 166 passengers.
Only 66 of the passengers were allowed to continue to their final destination in Belgium and only after a three hour 
delay.

 Another day, another chance for Ryanair to make the news. Today's incident comes from the Spanish            
Canary Islands where a plane full of passengers had to be emptied after a mass fight broke out.
The fight happened after one passenger got angry when he was told he'd need to pay to have his oversize bag 
checked. This didn't go down well with him, or with the large number of fellow students he was traveling with.
A fight broke out and the flight crew called for assistance. Police arrived, and all 168 passengers were told to leave 
the plane.
According to the news report, all passengers had to be "identified", which probably means the flight crew pointed 
out which of them were involved in the scuffle.
Of those 168, only 64 were allowed to fly home to Belgium. The rest of them were forced to spend the night in 
Lanzarote. None of the students stranded on the island had any money left, so the Belgian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs had to intervene, forcing Ryanair to fly the students back. This will take several days as the group is being 
flown back five or six at a time.
Thankfully for Ryanair, this is one incident that can't be blamed on them - and those passengers stuck on the island 
deserve all the inconvenience they can get.

In terms of passenger use, the railways are enjoying a ˜golden age. Figures earlier in the week showed that 1.32 
billion passenger journeys were made last year. Not only was this figure well up on 2009 but it was also the highest 
railway use since the mid-1920s (if the 1939-45 war period is excluded).
Inevitably, this scenario begs the question as to how future rail demand levels can be met. In the long-term, the 
Government plans to modernise the network, with the c£34 billion High Speed 2 project being key. Initially, the latter 
is scheduled to run between London and Birmingham “ and eventually to Manchester and Leeds. Since High Speed 
2 is unlikely to be operational before 2026, other solutions should be explored.
Like many markets, the UK rail network suffers both from excess demand “ packed carriages to London during 
commuting hours “ and from inadequate demand “ near empty carriages in some rural areas. The market should be 
allowed to make its own adjustments. This philosophy should be embraced “ at least in part - by the planned 
franchise amendments. Longer franchises and more scope for the franchise holders to adjust to consumer demand 
are anticipated.
Much of the capacity concern focuses on both the West Coast and East Coast Main Lines, where trains are often 
very crowded. Why cant these standard services run regularly throughout the night, with very cheap tickets being 
on offer which would be highly attractive to students?
By adopting a Ryanair booking policy, the 1am London Kings Cross to Edinburgh fare, for example, could be 
minimal “ just like its fare to an obscure Polish city on a Tuesday in deep winter. At peak hours, market demand 
would ramp up fares. After all, many people currently fly during the night as well as visit 24-hour Tesco shops. Will 
24-hour rail travel eventually become the norm?

New York, February 3rd (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (OOTC:RYAOF)  (           
NASDAQ:RYAAY) are trading very close to calculated resistance at $31.50 with the current price action closing at 
just $30.78 placing the stock near levels that make it difficult to buy.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's current stock range is defined by current calculated support defined at $28.60 and by the resistance level 
at $31.50, the stock is clearly over-extended from support, making it difficult to establishing new long positions at 
this level.
Traders don't have a clear entry point for Ryanair, as the stock is well above support, however, as the stock pulls 
back towards $28.60 it will definitely provide a reference point to establish a trade. On the other hand if the stock 
decides to break above resistance level at $31.50 then traders will get an opportunity to enter Ryanair stock by 
establishing a position as the stock moves to a higher range.

Michael OLeary, chief executive of budget airline            Ryanair, was his usual feisty self today during a            
conference call accompanying his companys Q3 results.
The no-frills airline boss, famous for his            outspoken style, used the call to            let fly at competitors, tick off 
ignorant journalists and enjoy some banter with the analysts who came on to ask questions. Below weve gathered 
some soundbites:
On Air Frances new base in Marseille
˜We havent heard anything about Air France “ it already has a base in Marseille. So Im not sure what it is it has 
announced but I suspect its some dressed-up, not-very-important development.
On the situation in Egypt (where Ryanair doesnt fly)
˜Weve been fending off questions about the impact of the Egyptian crisis on us all morning. Its like, what are you 
talking about?
On fare rises
˜I see the kind of commentary coming out of the other airlines: well, were at the big airports so were going to get 
more business passengers and our fares will rise very significantly. I mean if that bullsh*t was true, BA would be the 
worlds most profitable, most successful airline. Its not.
On analysts with two questions
˜Robert, we charge extra for double questions!

With oil and inflation each marching inexorably up and the Middle East again ablaze, its as if were slowly going 
back to the decade of leisure suits. No surprise then that an iconic 70²s sitcom summed up equity action. When it 
came to winning weeks, the Dow did indeed conclude            Eight is Enough, its 0.41% slippage on Cairo concerns 
snapping a two month upturn. (Also read            Revolt in Egypt: Two Investment Scenarios.) Accordingly, the 30-
year bond yield surged to a nine month high just as one Bond            bid us his swan song, and similar safe haven 
buying sent gold to its best single session showing for three months on Friday. (Making King Tut worth much more, 
always            assuming he survives the week intact.) Standout stocks in otherwise uninspiring market action 
included Natuzzi SpA (NTZ), the Bari based sofa and sectional maker surging 19.9% with Italians evidently inspired 
by the $63 million Englishmen recently            uncovered in their couches.
Though he can well afford it with corn surging while wheat is at its highest level in 29 months, a Kansas City pitcher 
walked away from $12 million. This as Goldman Sachs (GS)            super-sized the salary of its CEO in a filing, 
announced late on a Friday afternoon for some strange reason. It comes as Lloyd Blankfeins track record for œ           
doing Gods work could be questioned, what with the            foreclosure rate rising ominously at religious 
institutions. Today in economics, Januarys Chicago Purchasing Managers Index is out at 9:45AM Eastern. On the 
corporate front another full week for fourth quarter earnings is underway with Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Exxon 
Mobil (XOM), Gannett (GCI), Honda Motor (HMC), McKesson (MCK), and Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) all due to

Ryanair CEO            Michael O'Leary is probably the most insane airline CEO in the world - but at the same time, 
he's probably one of the most brilliant. Even when global airlines went into a panic during the recent economic 
meltdown, his airline stayed profitable, and his numbers usually outshine those of many legacy carriers.
So, when Mr. O'Leary held a conference call with members of the press to discuss his Q3 earnings report, it was 
filled with everything we've come to expect from him.
Inside Investor Relations picked some of the juiciest quotes,including him making fun of journalists, calling claims 
by British Airways "bullsh*t" and mocking Air France. Their take on the call            can be found here.
Mockery aside, the airline did have some bad news to report - it posted a $14 million loss in Q3 of 2010, mostly due 
to the major travel disruptions after record snowfall in Europe. Add the fallout from Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull, 
and 2010 was a pretty lousy year for Ryanair.
Stuff like this only makes me love Mr. O'Leary even more.

   Jan. 28, 2011 (The Economist delivered by Newstex) --
           A PIECE in this week's Economist looks at recent changes in the budget-airline market and the efforts 
carriers are making to pep up slowing growth rates. Ryanair, for example, is trying to make greater use of primary 
airports in order to "concentrate less on increasing traffic and more on extracting larger amounts of money from 
each passenger". And Air Berlin is also taking ideas from traditional airlines.
Air Berlin now arranges its timetables to encourage transfers at its Berlin Tegel, Düsseldorf and Palma hubs, like a 
traditional network carrier. It also has a frequent-flyer programme. Through its Niki associate in Austria, the airline 
even offers a direct flight from Berlin to Dubai three times a week. It is discussing a co-operation deal with Emirates, 
so that passengers from the Gulf carrier can connect in Vienna to fly to other European cities. Air Berlin is also 
joining the oneworld alliance based around British Airways and American Airlines. (NYSE:AMR)

   Jan. 24, 2011 (TradersHuddle.com delivered by Newstex) --
 New York, January 24th (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (OOTC:RYAOF)  
(NASDAQ:RYAAY) closed the trading day lower by $0.4 or -1.36% from its previous close. Ryanair's shares price 
action formed what is considered to be a doji close, where the open and close prices are very close to each other, 
mainly signaling an indecision between buyers and sellers.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's current stock range is defined by a trough, which marks calculated support at $28.60 and by a peak that 
marked the resistance point at $31.89. These levels are closely watched by traders managing their positions.
Traders wanting to establish a position in Ryanair or traders that are already holding the stock can use the doji 
close to their advantage, since the pattern present a short term pause in the stock's price action. This pause results 
in an entry point for traders depending of which way the stock resolves this short term indecision.
Doji are important candlesticks that provide information on their own and as components in a number of important 
patterns. Doji form when a security's open and close are virtually equal. The length of the upper and lower shadows 
can vary and the resulting candlestick looks like a cross, inverted cross or plus sign. Alone, doji are neutral patterns.
Any bullish or bearish bias is based on preceding price action and future confirmation. In the case of Ryanair, given 
that the stock finished the session lower, bears should monitor the stock, as it could reverse if it manages to trade 
above today's intraday high. Below a Doji illustration:

   Dec. 26, 2010 (International Political Economy Zone delivered by Newstex) -- 
           Is too much vacation bad? Working in academia right now, I must unreservedly state that one of its perks is 
having more free time once the semester is out. However, for the clock puncher / office slave classes, things are 
not as straightforward. Take the example of the Philippines. Inheriting a "hectic" holiday schedule from its colonial 
masters of manana the Spanish, things have gotten out of hand in recent years. In a bid to supposedly increase 
vacation trips and decrease disruptions due to holidays, it has had a habit of moving holidays that fall midweek to 
Fridays and Mondays.
However, the economic benefits of doing so are not clear. Indeed, industry voices and the president himself are 
looking to reduce the number of paid holidays to a more manageable 16 [!] days--still world-leading by any 
standard, though:
With less than two weeks left before Christmas this year, the Philippine government unveiled a holiday gift to its 
people: Friday would be day off to mark Christmas Eve, and a second public holiday, in honor of a national martyr, 
would be observed on Monday, Dec. 27.
The result was a windfall four-day weekend. But instead of invoking cheer, such surprises are increasingly being 
met with grumbles from Philippine business leaders, its president and even some of its heavily vacationed workers. 
The Dec. 12 holiday shuffle was part of a distinctly Philippine way of handing out and scheduling days off”offering 
many official vacation days, and often rearranging them at the last minute to fall on the nearest Friday or Monday.
The country's leaders have hoped the long weekends will encourage citizens to shop and travel, boosting retail 
sales and the local tourism industry. Former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo embraced the strategy, 
dubbed "holiday economics," and was often photographed on long weekends kitted out in a wetsuit for some 
surfing, or visiting her home province [of Pampanga], north of Manila.
Philippines ' Economics of Excessive Vacation
Not working out that way. First, disposable income is not high enough to encourage jaunts elsewhere in the 
Philippines during long weekends. Let's just say there isn't yet a habit of going around Europe on cheap Easyjet or 
Ryanair weekend trips:
The tourism industry in the Philippines accounts for 8% of total gross domestic product, compared with nearly 
double that in nearby Thailand, so shuffling and adding holidays to benefit the travel industry would have a relatively 
slight knock-on effect on the broader economy. Many Filipino workers don't earn enough to go off on lavish jaunts 
around the country anyway. The per capita income here averages under $2,000 a year. Even those with solid 
professional jobs struggle to make ends meet, and don't necessarily get paid on national holidays.
Second, all these paid holidays are, according to some, making the Philippines less attractive as a business 
destination compared to its neighbouring countries which get by on less R&R:
Fewer holidays could help stir more foreign interest in the economy. In a recent study, the Joint Foreign Chambers 
of Commerce warned that the number of holidays and their erratic timing dissuades some foreign companies from 
coming here. Under Philippine law, businesses have to double daily wages for those who work through the main 
public holidays, or pay up to 50% on other selected holidays. That is a powerful deterrent as lower-cost locations 
such as Bangladesh and Vietnam open up to the global economy.
Already, foreign direct investment is the lowest of the major Southeast Asian countries, totaling $1.95 billion in 2009 
compared with $4.88 billion in Indonesia, $7.60 billion in Vietnam and $5.96 billion in Thailand.Maybe too much 
vacation isn't good. But then again, I'm not exactly in a position to gripe, right?

resistance point at $31.59 might limit their upside, however if the stock breaks resistance, it could be a good point to 
add to the position.

 Thanks to OnlineTravelReview for this gem: A            Ryanairpilot has quit after being transferred to Lithuania, 
allegedly in response to his remarks against CEO Michael O'Leary in the            Financial Timesnewspaper.
Captain Morgan Fischer, a five year RyanAir pilot with more than 20 years of experience, is the first senior staff 
member to comment publicly against his employer. He wrote a letter in response to CEO O'Leary's suggestion that 
a 737 aircraft only needs on pilot and a "trained flight attendant" to jump in in the case of emergency. Fischer, who 
is no longer with the company, is quoted in FT as saying:
 "I would propose that Ryanair replace the CEO with a probationary cabin crew member currently earning 
approximately ??13,200 net per annum," Capt Fischer has written in a letter to the Financial Times, which reported 
Mr O'Leary's comments last week.
 "Ryanair would benefit by saving millions of euros in salary, benefits and stock options," the captain said, and there 
would be no need for approval from the authorities.
Fischer, an American, was recently transfarred from his base in Marseilles, France to Kaunas, Lithuania after his 
based closed. Cooincidence? We're not sure. But Fischer believes it's more than just bad luck - other pilots were 
offered spots in Spain, France and Italy, he says. Fischer has since quit.
That will teach you not to argue publicly with your employer. Or not.

 If I could make this stuff up, I'd become a novelist. Seriously.
Captain Morgan Fischer, a pilot with Ryanair, decided to try out the type of stunt for which his boss,            Michael 
O'Leary, is famous. And, he learned what happens when you tangle with a master media whore.
Apparently implying that O'Leary is a moron, Fischer took public issue with the company CEO's notion that a co-
pilot could be swapped out with a flight attendant. So, he suggested that O'Leary be replaced with someone from 
that pool of employees, specifically a "probationary cabin crew member currently earning ??13,200 a year."
I'm starting to believe that O'Leary is thin-skinned.
After taking a potshot at the Ryanair top dog, any hope Captain Morgan had of landing someplace warm was 
dashed. Rather,            according to the Guardian, he "was offered a transfer to Kaunas in            Lithuania after 
Ryanair announced the closure of operations in Marseille, where the pilot is based."
Keep in mind that Fischer, an American, is "embroiled in a contractual dispute with the airline and, according to 
Ryanair, did not submit a request for a reassignment destination." Unlike the other pilots in his situation, he won't be 
able to score a new spot in a place like Spain, Portugal or Italy.
There's a bit of extra significance here, because "Kaunas is considered Siberia for Ryanair pilots." That only leaves 
one question: is Ryanair considered Siberia for pilots at other            airlines

Last night I interviewed Labour MEP Mary Honeyball about her criticism of Ryanair for producing a charity calendar 
full of scantily clad flight attendants. Depsite the fact that it is expected to raise £85,000 for charity, Ms Honeyball 
thinks it shouldn't have been produced on the basis that it objectifies women and Ryanair may have put pressure on 
its employees to take part - not that she had a shred of evidence for the accusation, mind you. She seems quite 
happy for men to appear semi naked in calendars which are on sale in shopping centres around the country. What's 
the difference? We had a great caller last night, Laura in Epsom, who, speaking as a feminist, said she thought it 
was great that women felt liberated enough to appear in calendars like this. In my view, if semi naked firemen with 
their bodies covered in oil can appear on a calendar sold in a normal retail outlet, I cannot for the life of me see how 
one can object to Ryanair flight attendants appearing in their bikinis.
Mary Honeyball has done some fantastic work on preventing human trafficking. I think she should stick to that as 
she's on far safer ground than the flimsy arguments she produces in her interview.

How to Take The Kids to London
Kaleel Sakakeeny
London is a perfect family travel destination, and Just because you have kids doesnt mean you cant all go.
And the ratio of the pound to the dollar is improving.
A rebounding greenback will mean destinations that were off-limits to you last year are now accessible.
œThe strength of the dollar against the British pound means that this is a good time to take that trip to London, says 
Tom Hall, a travel editor for Lonely Planet in London.
By using value rail services like Eurostar or low-budget airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet, you can have a 
surprisingly affordable European vacation.
And Family Travel to London is ideal, because the city with its close cultural and historical ties is a terrific 
destination for families having their first overseas adventure.
The iconic attractions like the Double-decker bus and the famous London Bobby are familiar and comforting, and 
Londons underground system (TheTube) is easy for families to understand.
And that makes traveling through London fun, easy cultural experience.
Taking the Kids to London
Although London is a relatively simple family travel destination, family travel anywhere is a challenge.
Here are some simple but important  tips:
¢ Be sure to schedule free time. A day in the park people watching or having a picnic can beat any tourist attraction
¢ Let the kids carry their own money, and give them the experience of converting dollars to pounds. Its a great math 
assignment and builds confidence and self-esteem
¢ Split up! Mom and dad can go in separate directions, each with a child, and come together to share later. Kids 
love having experiences their siblings dont
Youll be surprised how many traveling families never think of this or are uncomfortable trying it
It works.
¢ Avoid hotels. Consider renting a short-term apartment or œflat. Youll save money on meals and œlive like a 
native shopping the local shops.
And youll meet people more quickly, and travel is always about connecting with people, not necessarily seeing 
places!
Let us know how you do, and watch the Taking Your Kids to London Family Travel Video PostCard

 Self Weighing Luggage launched to aid Business Travellers in 2011
The current weather conditions at Gatwick and other UK Airports are playing havoc with UK businesses travellers. 
Coming at a time when the the green shoots of recovery are appearing in the economy this is an unwanted blow. 
The recent recession has had many businesses and business travellers looking at costs and trying where possible 
to reduce their expenditure. For many, 2011 will see a return to the skies, but perhaps in a more cost-effective 
manner. Cost will be a driving force and the launch of self weighing luggage from FLYLIGHTLuggage.co.uk can 
help make the excess baggage charge history.
 (PRWeb UK) December 2, 2010
 The current weather conditions at Gatwick and other UK Airports are playing havoc with UK businesses travellers. 
Coming at a time when the the green shoots of receovery are appearing in the economy this is an unwanted blow.
The recent recession has had many businesses and business travellers looking at costs and trying where possible 
to reduce their expenditure. Delays and cancellations caused by weather, ash cloud or indeed industrial dispute 
have impacted on business travel budgets. For many this meant reducing air travel, however as the economy 
improves the imperative to get out and meet clients grows as well. While costs due to weather, strikes or volcanos 
are outside the control of the business traveller, some cost can be curtailed. Business travel in 2011 will see a 
return to the skies, but perhaps in a more cost-effective manner. Cost will be a driving force and most will be keen 
to avoid the scourge of the modern flyer “ the excess baggage charge.
Incidental revenues earned from excess baggage charges have been one of the key drivers of profits for airlines 
such as Ryanair and Easyjet, whilst even the traditional airlines such as BA earn revenue from such charges.
Self Weighing Luggage launched to aid Business Travellers in 2011
Packing for a business trip requires forethought and planning but on a trip where the itinerary has not been 
confirmed those extra pairs of shoes and clothing, not too mention, laptops, brochures or samples tossed into the 
suitcase at the last minute could just be enough to tip the baggage over the weight limit. This is where the airlines 
can add charges to the unsuspecting traveller. It many cases this can be many times the amount actually paid for 
the flight.
Although low budget airlines offer unbelievable great deals on air fares, these prices will rise substantially when 
luggage reaches the wrong end of the scales. With self weighing luggage such as FlyLight Luggage, business 
travellers can avoid inflated excess baggage fees with luggage with built in scales, making sure that weight limits 
are easily adhered to.
Indeed it was on a Ryanair flight from Shannon that, Flylight Luggage was born on the idea to innovate a core 
consumer product, incorporating an integral self weighing luggage device that fulfills the size dimensions of most 
airlines.
The recently launched self weighing luggage from FLYLIGHTLuggage.co.uk has been built with business travellers 
in mind and will save money, time and inconvenience. The clever digital display screen is battery operated (new 
batteries supplied) and is incorporated in the handle mechanism.
Flylight Luggage is the sole distributor in the UK for these cases; sets can be ordered on line by visiting the Flylight 
Luggage online store.
Deliveries take 3 to 5 days; all technical questions are answered on the website but there is also a helpline for any 
queries +44 (0) 1202 769 570.

For investors in most airline companies, 2010 has been a terrific  year. Most air carriers' stock prices soared in 
2010--a marked departure  from the previous several years of pain from a weak economy, excess  capacity, and oil 
price increases that in 2008 made fuel expenses their  highest percentage of airline operating costs ever.
Driving this  outperformance have been both fundamental and non-fundamental factors.  The industry has emerged 
from the recession healthy, with passenger  volumes rising nicely on effectively flat ticket prices and the  carriers' 
non-fuel costs down or growing modestly at best. In addition,  stock prices have been buffeted by a wave of 
consolidation that has  begun taking place;  Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV)   (NYSE:LUV - News) recently 
announced that it will acquire fellow low-cost carrier  AirTran Holdings (NYSE:AAI)   (NYSE:AAI - News),  and 
United Airlines owner UAL Corporation recently merged with  Continental Airlines to form  United Continental 
Holdings (NYSE:UAL)   (NYSE:UAL - News), the largest airline company in the world. These deals have come on 
the heels of  Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL)   (NYSE:DAL - News)  acquiring Northwest Airlines in 2008, and they 
have helped underscore  the fact that the entire airline industry seems to be embracing capacity  discipline and is 
focusing on cost containment. In addition, investors  ostensibly are pricing acquisition premiums into some of the 
remaining  names in the space.
Explosive Stock-Price Returns
Holders of  almost all airline companies have been rewarded nicely in 2010. United  Continental, for instance, was 
up 125% in the first 10 months of 2010,  while  US Airways (NYSE:LCC)   (NYSE:LCC - News) rose 144%,  Alaska 
Air Group (NYSE:ALK)   (NYSE:ALK - News)  increased 53%, and AirTran, buoyed by its purchase offer by 
Southwest,  rose 42%. Other players also have registered nice gains, including   JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU)   
The Case For Betting Against The Airlines (LUV, AAI, UAL , DAL , LCCALKJBLURYAAY, FAA, AMR , SKYW)
(NasdaqGS:JBLU - News)(up 28%), Delta (up 22%),  Ryanair Holdings  (NasdaqGS:RYAAY - News)(up 22%), and 
Southwest (up 20%).
Traditional  open-end mutual funds have modest exposure at best to the airline  industry; for example, last month, 
Morningstar's Fund Spy column noted  that no one mutual fund as of Oct. 7 had invested more than 14.5% of its  
assets in airlines. Instead, we believe that the best way to gain  exposure to the entire airline industry while avoiding 
single-stock risk  is through an exchange-traded fund. In addition, we highlight that the  ETF structure offers some 
flexibility for investors that traditional  mutual funds do not offer, including the ability to short an ETF that an  
investor believes is overvalued.
Investing in an Airline ETF
Right now, investors can consider just one airline ETF,  Guggenheim Airline  (NYSEArca:FAA - News),  which 
began trading in early 2009 and which has nearly doubled in price  since that time. A concentrated ETF that holds 
just 23 airline  companies, Guggenheim Airline is a modified equal-dollar-weighted fund,  with large allocations 
devoted to United Continental (almost 19% of  assets), and Delta and Southwest (each of which comprises another 
15% or  so of assets). Just over 75% of assets are invested in U.S. airlines;  other U.S.-listed companies that FAA 
holds include US Airways, JetBlue,   AMR Corporation (NYSE:AMR)   (NYSE:AMR - News), SkyWest  
(NasdaqGS:SKYW - News), Alaska Air Group, and Ryanair Holdings.
Given  current industry fundamentals and FAA's high valuation, we believe that  this ETF would make a compelling 
short opportunity for an investor.
First,  there is no question that investors in the airline industry need a  strong stomach. There have been more than 
180 bankruptcies in the  industry over the past 30 years, and since deregulation in the late  1970s, the industry has 
been plagued by issues like capital intensity,  minimal customer-switching costs, and cutthroat competition. In more  
recent years, oil-price volatility has only exacerbated the industry's  structural issues. Indeed, famed investor 
Warren Buffett purchased  preferred shares in US Airways (then known as USAir) in the early 1990s  and later rode 
the company into bankruptcy before recovering and booking  a small profit; Buffett has lamented that investment, 
calling it his  worst one ever. He also has noted that in the airline industry, "you've  got huge fixed costs, you've got 
strong labor unions and you've got  commodity pricing. That is not a great recipe for success." And while,  as we 
noted above, we are encouraged by better and more rational  behavior on the part of the airlines in the form of 
capacity discipline  and cost containment, the industry has to overcome a long track record  to the contrary. On top 
of this, recently rising fuel costs have not yet  begun to affect airlines' earnings results but undoubtedly will in  
coming quarters, quite possibly to a level greater than the carriers are  suggesting in their guidance.
In addition, the valuation of air  carriers is very high, in our opinion, and bound to revert to the mean,  given that 
merger premiums appear to be baked into many companies' share  prices. Although further consolidation 
unquestionably is ahead, we do  not believe that all carriers will be acquired away, meaning that share  prices are 
likely to fall back down to earth. Also, of the nine  U.S-listed companies in this fund that Morningstar's equity 
analysts  follow (comprising almost 69% of the assets of this ETF), just  two--United Continental and AMR--trade at 
any meaningful discount to our  analysts' fair value estimates. The other seven all trade at or above  our analysts' 
fair value estimates. In addition, Morningstar's equity  analysts assign uncertainty ratings of "very high" to five of 
these nine  companies, and "extreme" uncertainty ratings to the other four: Delta,  American, US Airways, and 
United. We believe those factors make an ETF  that is ripe to be shorted.
FAA charges an annual expense ratio of  0.65%, which may seem high. However, this ETF holds airline stocks  
traded on exchanges all around the world, and it would be very costly  for investors to try to assemble this same 
portfolio of companies on  their own. We also would alert investors that this ETF is not very  liquid, meaning that 
investors should keep a close eye on bid-ask  spreads when transacting. That said, individual investors using limit  
orders for FAA probably won't run into any liquidity issues. And, we'd  also note that taking an outright short position 
The Case For Betting Against The Airlines (LUV, AAI, UAL , DAL , LCCALKJBLURYAAY, FAA, AMR , SKYW)
in a security,  including an ETF, can expose investors to the unlimited loss potential  if the ETF continues to rise. In 
addition, the expense ratio actually  serves as a slight tailwind for the investor who is short.
Few Other ETF Options 
Right  now, FAA is the lone ETF with any meaningful exposure whatsoever to the  airline industry. Other ETFs in 
which airline companies are included  make fairly ineffective options for an investor who is searching for  airline 
exposure. For example, five airline companies are included in  the shipper-intense  iShares Dow Jones 
Transportation Average   (NYSEArca:IYT - News)  (0.47% expense ratio), which has the next-largest airline  
representation of any U.S. ETF. However, even in IYT, the air carriers  have fairly small position sizes (together 
comprising less than 8.6% of  the ETF's assets), and the performance of IYT and FAA hasn't been  particularly 
correlated historically. After IYT, the representation by  airline companies in U.S. ETFs drops precipitously. If 
anything, the  best alternative is probably to buy single stocks of airlines, despite  the risk that single-stock investing 
presents.
Note that ETF  providers are known for chasing returns, with good-performing sectors  typically having several 
product launches while they're hot. However,  until recently, aviation has not had a prolonged period of strong  
returns while ETFs have been growing. So we would not be at all  surprised to see other ETF providers launch 
niche aviation-themed ETFs  in the future.

New York, December 2nd (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (OOTC:RYAOF)  
(NASDAQ:RYAAY) closed the trading session at $31.51 just above calculated resistance at $30.73 moving to what 
appears to be a new range, as this move will clearly raise the attention of momentum buyers.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's stock was trading in a well defined range with support at $28.80 and resistance at $30.73, given that this 
range was broken traders will be closely monitoring the stock?s price action for clues of direction.
From a technical perspective it can be expected that previous resistance becomes support, as the new range gets 
defined, however, given that Ryanair's stock is still near the broken resistance level, traders will be focusing on 
$30.73 to see if the stock holds the breakout without rolling over.

Unlike the best airlines,            which are all located in Asia, the world's worst airlines are scattered around the 
continents.
           Zagat's airline survey identified three terrible airlines in China, four in Europe, along with our very own US 
Airways. (NYSE:LCC)
The only airlines that scored lower than US Airways were budget airlines like easyJet, Spirit and Ryanair and one 
company from Russia.

   Nov. 30, 2010 (The Magistrate's Blog delivered by Newstex) -- 
 This blog is blessed with a following of people who read, comment, agree, disagree, query, quibble, and whatnot. 
Apart from my loyal following of Mr. Toad and his acolytes (who maintain silence unless I venture to suggest that 
some drivers treat the law too casually for my taste) I don't imagine that I have too many avid readers from the 
criminal fraternity.
So here, as an early Christmas present, are a few of Uncle Bystander's hard-learned insights into the sharp end of 
criminal justice:-
i) A life of crime is rubbish, even if you are good at it.
ii) It's no fun having a stash of gold bars buried under the patio if you lie awake nights wondering when Harry The 
Hatchet or (preferably) the Old Bill come crashing through the door to exact their particular kind of retribution.
iii) Most drug dealers live with their Mum and don't earn enough to fund their own habit. The blinged-up Merc-
driving Mr. Big is largely a media myth. It's a dirty shifty business.
iv) Never trust your Co-D. 'Honour Among Thieves' is bollocks. You think he's your mate but after he has sold you 
down the river he will rob his Granny's purse.
v) Listen to your brief. He is smarter and better educated than you. He is very likely free, as well. If he tells you to 
plead, plead. If he tells you it's worth a run, go for it but don't forget the one-third off that you are gambling with. In 
court, shut up. Let him do the talking, you can do the time. Win or lose he goes home to his wife and kids.
vi) However much you hear about rubbish Government computers, don't forget that even the piss-poor ones have a 
really long memory. If you have had a result in avoiding capture for some piece of naughtiness, but the police have 
your DNA or prints or whatever - forget about that Ryanair cheapie with Angie-Leigh or Kayley. The airport 
computer will sort out a reception committee for you before you have left Kos.
vii) Think carefully before you elect for the Crown Court. A jury is easier to fool than a bench of JPs (who are, trust 
me, rarely as daft as they look) but if you come unstuck and you get the wrong judge you will get hammered. I sat 
next to one of the old school once as he sentenced a mugger. Even on a late plea, Hizonner weighed the man off 
for a nine, when the unofficial estimates were for five at worst.
Good luck, but don't push your luck.

so definitely the sellers in control, as the stock's volume is already above average.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair has already traded 1.15 times its 3-month average volume, and has calculated support and resistance at 
$28.80 and $30.73 respectively. Traders like to use volume as their lie detector for price action moves through 
predefined trading ranges.
The overall market index S&P 500 is trading lower by -1.01% from its previous trading close, which means that 
Ryanair stock is outperforming the overall market.

The announcement of the            Royal engagement of Prince William to Kate Middleton is a cause for celebration 
in the UK. As advertisers, retailers, and the British Government eye up the opportunities for related advertising, 
merchandising, and tourism, it is the perfect opportunity to explore and refresh our knowledge on the rules and 
etiquette in the UK regarding advertising and promotion of the Royal Family and Royal events.
By and large, etiquette in the UK dictates that members of the Royal Family should not be used in any form of 
marketing communication or advertising which suggests their affiliation with or endorsement of a particular product 
and service. The UKs Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) CAP Code of advertising practice endorses this view, 
advising that members of the Royal Family should not be shown or mentioned in marketing communications without 
their prior permission (rule 6.2).  Incidental references to Royal Family members which are unconnected to the 
advertised product, or are merely a reference to a book, film, or article about the individual, may be acceptable. It 
remains to be seen whether the ASA will take any action in respect of Irish budget airline company Ryanair, which 
has already used a picture of the newly engaged couple to promote their low air fares
Rule 3.52 of the CAP Code advises that Royal Arms or Emblems should not be used by marketers without prior 
permission of the Lord Chamberlain, the senior official in the Royal Household. Conventional representations of the 
Royal Arms are as follows:
Section 99 of the UK Trade Mark Act 1994 takes a stronger view, making use of the Royal Arms or Emblems (or 
arms or emblems so closely resembling the Royal Arms that they are likely or calculated to deceive) in connection 
with a business and without the authority of the Queen, a criminal offence
The            UK Trade Mark Act also prevents applications to register trade marks incorporating elements of Royalty, 
such as the Royal Arms, or signs or devices resembling the Royal Arms, representations of the Royal Crown or any 
British Royal Etiquette: Dos and Donts of Advertising and Promotion
Royal flag, representations or portraits of the Royal Family, names of the Royal Family or names and pictorial 
representations of Royal residences (e.g. Balmoral), unless prior consent has been given by or on behalf of the 
Queen. Applications to register marks incorporating the word ROYAL may also be opposed or rejected, particularly 
where the word is used in relation to high quality goods which might suggest Royal patronage, for example luxury or 
organic foods or high quality porcelain, or where the word is used alone or in conjunction with a descriptive word 
(e.g. ROYAL VENISON for meat). Marks of Royal Patronage, or Royal Warrants, may be applied to goods and 
services which have received formal endorsement by the Royal Family for their quality and excellence, but only by 
the particular Warrant Holder (individual or company) to whom the right has been granted.
So etiquette and law dictates that images or references to the Royal Family, or Royalty in general, should be used 
with extreme caution. However if Prince Williams engagement and Royal Wedding generates anything like the 
fervour created by that of his parents, the nations appetite for Royal memorabilia and commemorative 
merchandising will be considerable. If the estimated projections of the boost the Royal Wedding may have to the 
British economy are correct (£620 million has been suggested), marketers will likely want a slice of the royal pie, 
etiquette or not.

Portugal Is Preparing For A One-Day All-Out National Strike

   Nov. 24, 2010 (The Business Insider delivered by Newstex) --
PORTUGAL IS PREPARING for a day of            all-out national strike today, as part of a nationwide public protest 
against the countrys austerity budget which is set for approval in parliament on Friday.
The countrys two main trade unions, UGT and CGTP, are both holding a national day of industrial action “ the first 
time in 0ver two decades that the two unions have arranged co-ordinated protests “ and will involve workers from 
both the public and private sectors.
The two unions between them have over 1.5 million workers, and an overwhelming majority of them are expected to 
take part.
Opposition to the severe Budget is widespread, and its passage was only secured after the Social Democratic 
Party, the largest opposition party “ which had threatened to block its passage “            agreed to abstain on the 
vote.
Left Bloc leader Francisco Louca, who commands the fourth-biggest share of the Assembly of the Republic, has 
slammed the package, saying it would œpenalise families with tax increases and salary cuts.
Prime Minister Jose Socrates, however, has            pledged to remain in power and attempt to introduce the budget 
in efforts to avoid becoming the third Eurozone country “ after Greece and Ireland “ to require a bailout.
 Transport hit 
100% of staff on the Lisbon Metro system walked out of work at midnight, along with the entirety of the staff in many 
of the countrys city and town halls.
Portugal Is Preparing For A One-Day All-Out National Strike
Private businesses and transport have been massively affected;            the Wall Street Journal reports that the two 
largest main commuter lines into the countrys capital have also been shut down, while the majority of air travel into 
the country has also been hit.
           The Irish Independent reports that Ryanair has cancelled four flights to Faro airport “ two each from Dublin 
and Cork “ while Aer Lingus has cancelled its flight in both directions between Lisbon and Dublin.
Ryanair alone has been forced to pull 60 flights across its entire European operation as a result of the strikes, and 
claims that the industrial action is more disruptive to its operations than the volcanic ash cloud had proven earlier 
this year.
Portugals finances are under such strain that the archbishop of Braga has called on priests in his diocese to donate 
a months wages to those suffering hardest in the crisis.
œWe live in extremely serious times. We cannot ignore this and must show a concrete love for the people, 
Archbishop Jorge Ortega said in a letter to priests,            AFP reports.
The cost of borrowing for the Portuguese government            has this morning breached the 7% mark, for the first 
time since November 11.

 What would travel bloggers do without Ryanair? From            trying to get rid of co-pilots to arresting passengers 
for            complaining about the sandwiches, the budget airline provides endless grist for our mill.
Yesterday more than a hundred passengers refused to leave their plane after their Ryanair flight from Fez, 
Morocco, to Beauvais, France, was diverted to Belgium. It was one of four Ryanair flights diverted to Liege due to 
foggy conditions in France. Passengers were offered a bus to their final destination, a journey of 225 miles. While 
passengers in three of the planes agreed to go, those in the fourth flight refused, insisting to be flown there instead. 
The flight had departed Fez three hours late and landed in Liege at 11:30 PM. The passengers didn't leave the 
plane until 3:30 in the morning to catch a 4:30 AM bus home.
That's the story both sides agree on. Beyond this, there are two stories. Passengers say they were then abandoned 
by the crew, who even left the cockpit open, and were not given any water for several hours. The toilets were also 
locked.
Ryanair said the crew stayed for an hour and only left when some passengers got disruptive. They also say that 
they would have gotten an earlier bus if they had agreed to leave.

A Ryanair crew locked more than 100 passengers on a plane in Belgium after they refused to get off the aircraft, the       
     Daily Mailreports.
The mostly French commuters were incensed that the plane, which was supposed to land near Paris, had been re-
routed to Liege in neighboring Belgium due to bad weather.
The crew offered for the stranded travelers to sit in a transit lounge inside the airport, but were rejected. So they 
locked the toilets, turned off the lights, and got off the plane.

   Nov. 11, 2010 (The Economist delivered by Newstex) --
WHAT will the hotel of tomorrow look like? According to œ           Hotels 2020: Beyond Segmentation, a new report 
from Amadeus, a company that provides technology to the travel industry it will be a place where clever use of 
technology and social media allow the customer's desires to be met ever more effectively.
Indeed if I were a hotelier, the future outlined in the report would make me blanche. It predicts a growing cult of 
individualism among guests, who will increasingly expect their hotel experience to be configured precisely as they 
want it. Rohit Talwar, a futurist who wrote the report, talked to me about œthe emergence of an app culture, where 
consumers expect to have what they want when they want it.
As a result, hotels will have to be adaptable on several levels, not only to the range of macro-economic scenarios 
that could result from the fall-out to the financial crisis, but also to the particular needs of these newly individualist 
guests. As the report puts it:
A greater emphasis will be placed on offering a consumer led spectrum of choices from which guests can 
personalize their hotel stay “ encompassing everything from room size to linens, media and amenities.
Guests will not want to pay for the things they do not need. Mr Talwar questions whether they will still, for example, 
be prepared to pay for 400 television channels if they are only interested in a couple, or will be bringing their own 
entertainment and so just want a plug and Wi-Fi. And why should they be content with bog-standard hotel-chosen 
artwork on the walls when digital displays can show their own choice of photographs and pictures?
What kind of hotel will this rather spoilt new-age traveller be checking in to? Mr Talwar sees changes to hotel 
design happening in waves. So over the next two to three years hotels will be ripping out front desks, and guests 
will check in and out in their rooms or online. Then, with the next wave of technology, the vision becomes decidedly 
futuristic. Public spaces become invaded by technology, or specifically œvisual clutter, where guests sit watching 
The individualist's dream
3D holograms from their phones. And indeed, since customers wont want to sit down beside somebody watching a 
holographic movie on their computer, the best hotels will have to work out new ways to allow this technological elite 
to co-exist.
In an effort to pay for all this, hotels will increasingly try to maximise revenues from each customer. As Ryanair has 
realised, captive audiences are there to be sold to, and for hotels that might mean gadgets, branded goods, or more 
unusual items such as a œcity card that a guest can use to pay for items around the city. Hotel branding will change 
in other ways, of course. Where Giorgio Armani led the way in Dubai, others may follow. Indeed new entrants won't 
be restricted to the fashion world. The report poses the rather scary question: "Would there be customers for the 
Jumeirah Beckham Towers or the Hyatt Madonna?"

   Nov. 1, 2010 (Minyanville delivered by Newstex) -- 
 September, traditionally the single worst month in equities, saw the S&P 500 Index post its best such performance 
since 1939. October, which has had such historic market meltdowns as 1929 and 1987, was witness to a Dow gain 
of 3.06%, good for its best performance for four years. Since today starts what has invariably been the best three 
month period of the entire year for shares, contrarians have good reason to be concerned. A stock named Monster 
(MWW) appropriately enough paced the entire S&P 500 on the last session before Halloween, a 25.50% increase 
on Friday capping its best week since October of 08. Printer maker Lexmark International (LXK) experienced the 
scariest week, ending 19.0% lower after its top-line earnings came in light. On this particular Friday however 
commentators were careful to avoid the usual hyperbole of Wall Street, and no one was saying its stock            had 
bombed.
Two men in their mid fifties, Bill Gates and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, both celebrated their birthdays on October 28th 
but the State Department remembered only one, even on the day Microsoft (MSFT) easily topped earnings 
estimates en route to rising 5.1% on the week. Pontiac            passed away on Sunday, as did another noteworthy 
octogenarian. Will both be sadly missed?            Ask not. And while China took ownership of the            worlds 
fastest supercomputer from America,            an 18 year old from these United States beat the Chinese on home soil 
to the Miss World crown, a reminder that for all the present economic attention over China, the rapidly aging country 
could very likely get old before it gets rich. Today in economics, Octobers ISM manufacturing index and September 
construction spending are each out at 10:00AM Eastern. Peak earnings season has passed but today still sees 
Allergan (AGN), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Baker Hughes (BHI), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A), Corning (GLW), 
Humana (HUM), News Corp (NWS), and Ryanair (RYAAY) all expected to announce results.
Initiations
Discovery Communications (DISCA): The stock is a new Neutral at Cowen & Company.
Upgrades and Downgrades: Life Is Swell For Intel
AudioCodes (AUDC): AUDC is begun at Market Outperform at Rodman & Renshaw, which sets a $5.60 price 
target. The brokerage believes the stock is a way to play the early stages of a secular recovery.

World Fuel Services (INT): BB&T (NYSE:BBT)  Capital rates World Fuel Services (NYSE:INT)  a new Buy and 
assigns a $40 price objective.
Upgrades
Intel (INTC): Key Dow component Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)  is upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Macquarie, 
which has a $24.90 price target. See also            What Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN) Is Telling Tech Investors.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): Meanwhile rival semiconductor stock Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD)  is

 Government greed for new tax monies, from whatever source, is endless. The new German tourist tax, however, 
threatens to cost much more money than it will bring in. We read:
Ryanair axes 1,000 jobs at German airport - Business News, Business - The Independent
(Hat tip to CaryGEE.)
We fly Ryanair in Europe.
Ryanair makes travel affordable and permits air travel to European destinations which in the old days of outrageous 
air fares were impossible to reach by airplane because of the usurious flight costs.
We say, leave Lufthansa and their inflated fares to the business passengers who can charge their flights to their 
companies as tax write-offs as a cost of doing business. Many private people on the other hand can not afford the 
high Lufthansa (and other carrier) rates for domestic European travel and every extra Euro hurts.
Now Germany is planning to tax the cheap airfare business by assessing a flight surcharge on tourists.
There are any number of things that a nation could or should tax to raise money, but tourists and tourist travel 
would not seem to be the right thing.
Who came up with this crazy scheme in Germany?
Whoever came up with the idea should lay down his or her political career and go do something useful.
Ryanair Reducing Operations in Germany because of Ill-Conceived German Tourist Tax
Ryanair already wrote the following news release in            June (24 June, 2010), warning the German government 
of the consequences of the tourist tax:
 style="color: #996633; font-size: 18px; text-align: center; text-transform: "Ryanair Concerned That Proposed 
German Tourist Tax Will Damage German Tourism, Jobs & Economy INDEPENDENT RESEARCH PROVES 
THAT TOURIST TAXES CAUSE TOURISM DECLINES WHILE NON-TAX COUNTRIES GROW  
Ryanair, the worlds favourite airline, today (24supthsup June) called on the German Govt to abandon its plan to 
introduce a tourist tax on flights which will inevitably lead to steep declines in German air traffic and tourism 
particularly in the German regions. Independent research (by RDC Aviation) proves that seat capacity (and traffic) 
grew strongly in those EU countries which do not impose tourist taxes (Belgium and Holland), while countries which 
impose tourists taxes such as the UK and Ireland continue to suffer steep traffic and tourism declines.
At the conference, Dutch economist Jan Veldhuis, of Amsterdam Aviation Economics, presented a report on the 
Dutch ˜Eco tax which resulted in the Dutch govt scrapping the tax after it estimated the tax would result in up to 
10,000 jobs losses, ??1.2bn is lost tourism, airport and airline revenues and cost the govt up to ??200m in 
unemployment payments while generating as little as ??260m in its first year.
Ryanair warned that any proposed tourist tax in Germany would have a similar impact and cause steep declines in 
traffic at German airports and lead to tourism declines and job losses.
Speaking today in Berlin, Ryanairs Michael OLeary said,
œThe German Govts proposed tourist tax will make Germany an uncompetitive, expensive tourism destination 
which will result in lost visitors, lost jobs, lost tourism revenues and end up costing Germany far more than the tax 
will generate.
œIndependent analysis by RDC Aviation proves that countries which impose tourist taxes continue to see capacity, 
traffic and tourism declines. Growth has returned throughout Europe except in countries such as Ireland and the UK 
which continue to tax tourists instead of welcoming them.
œAs the Dutch experience proves, tourist taxes are deeply damaging and self-defeating and we hope that the 
German Govt will see sense and scrap their plans for a tourist tax."

When the German government recently announced a new tourist tax designed to offset their budget woes, many 
airlines announced they'd be forced to cut flights and jobs. So far, Irish low cost carrier            Ryanair has been the 
only one to actually deliver on that threat.
Because of the upcoming tax, the airline is reducing its presence at Frankfurt Hahn airport. At the moment, Ryanair 
operates over 530 flights from Hahn, and will bring that down to 382. In the process, 1000 jobs will be lost. Three of 
the airlines Boeing (NYSE:BA)  737 aircraft will be moved to other airports in their route network. 
From Frankfurt, this also means the loss of routes to Berlin, Prague and Gothenburg. The size of the Ryanair 
operation in Frankfurt is massive - and this reduction in flights means the airline will handle 1 million fewer 
passengers a year. 
If Ryanair is just the first of German based airlines to make cuts like this, the proposed ??8 tourist tax will most 
likely all go to waste on unemployment benefits for fired workers.

MARTIN BROUGHTON'S been eating too much red meat. As if            being rude about the American approach to 
airport security wasn't enough aggression for one speech, the chairman of British Airways also            told a joke 
about Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair.
In Mr Broughtons telling, Mr OLeary goes into a pub, asks for a pint of Guinness and is told by the barman that it 
will cost him £1.
œJust £1? asks Mr OLeary.
œWell, Im a great fan of yours, says the barman.
So Mr OLeary hands over £1 and the barman goes to pour the pint, when he stops and asks: œWould you be 
wanting a glass with that?
Ho ho. (We can't, by the way, credit Mr Broughton with that joke, which has been doing the rounds since at least 
April.)

 After last months proposal of an 80% tax rate for bankers, Ken Livingstone has come up with another ingenious 
idea - tax people who go on holiday more than once a year! Cos they must be filthy rich, innit.
He made a speech at the Travel Convention in Malta this week (a nice paid gig if ever there was one), declaring 
that overseas holidays were "a class issue". He went on to say that he would like to see a tax imposed after the first 
outbound holiday of the year. He has clearly never heard of the word 'aspiration'.
Overseas holidays are certainly not a class issue in the 21st century. When you can get a £30 return to Rome with 
RyanAir you can hardly claim these holidays are to do with class. Taxing people to go on more than one holiday a 
year is a fatuous idea based on outmoded notions of what constitutes being rich and affluent. People should be free 
to go on as many holidays a year as they like. We are already taxed to the hilt when we abroad and don't need to 
be faced with even more charges.
Anyway, how on earth would it be policed? What constitutes a holiday?
We all know plenty of people who go abroad to visit their families. Does that constitute a holiday? These hairbrain 
ideas just show how out of touch Ken really is with modern day Londoners.
With policies like these, Boris had better watch out. Not.

 The retirement age in France is 60. Given demographics and increasing longevity, this is not sustainable. None of 
that matters to people on the take. Moreover, and unlike Greece, polls shows most support the striking workers.
Please consider French Workers Strike Against Sarkozy Pension PlanFrench workers are demonstrating today for 
the fourth time in five weeks in nationwide marches, disrupting rail and air traffic as labor unions threaten open- 
ended strikes to press President Nicolas Sarkozy to scrap his pension-system overhaul.
Railway and Paris subway workers and as well as teachers, air-traffic controllers and port and refinery employees 
walked out to protest plans to raise the retirement age to 62 from 60 and lift the age for a full pension to 67 from 65. 
Unions, which warn they may renew the strike every 24 hours unless the government backs down, said 244 
marches will take place across France today in cities including Toulouse, Marseille and Nantes.
Three rallies since Sept. 7 that brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets failed to derail 
Sarkozys retirement proposals. The government says the changes are needed to help France cope with an aging 
population and help balance the pension systems budget by 2018. Labor unions called for more demonstrations on 
Oct. 16.
œWe need this reform to save our system, [said Luc Chatel, the government spokesman]
A survey in yesterdays Le Parisien newspaper showed 69 percent of the respondents support todays protest and 
61 percent said they favor an open-ended strike. The Paris-based pollster CSA called 1,011 adults on Oct. 6-7 and 
gave no margin of error.
French Unions On Strike Against Pension Reform, Disrupt Rail, Air Traffic
Frances aviation authority advised carriers to cut half of their flights to and from Paris Orly airport and a third to and 
from Roissy Charles de Gaulle because of the air-traffic controllers strike. The Lyon airport canceled 21 percent of 
its flights it said on its web site.
Air France-KLM Group said the protest wont affect its long-haul flights, while some European and domestic flights 
will be canceled or delayed. Ryanair Holdings Plc (OOTC:RYAOF)  (NASDAQ:RYAAY)  said its canceling 250 
French flights today.
The RER B commuter train, which connects Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports, will face the most disruption, with 
no trains running inside Paris, forcing travelers to take other transportation.
Workers at refineries and gas and electricity plants joined the strike. Employees at the oil terminal at the port of 
Marseille, who have been on strike for the past 15 days because of the governments plan to revamp the ports 
system, joined in. The correct government response to this mess is to do what Reagan did to the PATCO workers, 
fire all the public union employees on strike and terminate their benefits.
Moreover, the French government should take this opportunity handed to them on a silver platter and go one step 
further to make a much needed change and dissolve all public unions. The same should happen in the US.
This would end the nonsense quickly and effectively. As in the US, there would be lines miles long to take those 
jobs at much lower wage and benefit levels.

   Oct. 12, 2010 (Money Crashers - Personal Finance Blog delivered by Newstex) --
One of the biggest benefits that I have ever gained from getting myself out of debt is to have the financial means to 
travel internationally. Of course it is a matter of personal taste, but if my choices are driving a brand new sports car 
or taking several trips to foreign countries, its an easy decision. Buy the latest flat screen TV or take a sightseeing 
trip through Europe? Its a no brainer. There is nothing as fulfilling to me as being able to experience a new part of 
the world.
I have had the pleasure of traveling internationally six times now in my life, three times in the last three years. Am I 
rich? Not by any stretch of the imagination. But I have uncovered some awesome methods that will help you save 
some serious money the next time you travel internationally:
1. Consider a Travel Agent
One would think that using a travel agent would do nothing more than add an unneeded expense to your trip. After 
all, with the Internet, youd think you should be able to find the cheapest air fares just as easily as any travel agent 
could, right? Well, actually, travel agents have access to a ton of resources and unadvertised fares that we cant 
access. Moreover, the online resources that are used in other countries for finding cheap flights and hotels are 
different than those we use in the US. There are some websites we havent even heard of. Lastly, travel agents 
simply have way more knowledge than us because they have so much more experience. For example, you cant 
expect a first-time international traveler to know that Ryanair and easyJet are the two leading discount airlines in 
Europe. You cant expect a first-time traveler to know whether it makes sense to travel by rail or air in a certain 
country or continent. Someone visiting a country for the first time wouldnt know his left foot from his right when it 
comes to choosing the best hotel that will offer the top deal.
4 Tips To Save On International Travel
The long and short of it is that I would definitely consider using a travel agent, especially if youre traveling 
internationally for the first time. When I traveled internationally for the first time, I was pretty nervous, especially with 
two layovers in countries where I did not speak the language. My travel agent was able to provide me with tips and 
strategies for navigating these foreign airports with little to no obstacle. The agent also helped me find a great hotel 
deal and recommended the best way to travel within the country that I was visiting.
2. Renting
Rather than scouring the internet for cheap and affordable hotel accommodations, you can save yourself a bundle 
by renting an apartment during your stay. They are pretty easy to find, believe it or not. The rental fees are 
unbelievably reasonable, and I think it also lends an air of creativity to your trip. I rented apartments in Kiev, St. 
Petersburg, and Paris, and had great experiences in each of these places. You not only save a ton of money and 
live in huge places, but you also get to see how the œlocals live. Living so culturally also will help you gain the best 
experience while youre there. For example, I could go to my landlord to find good local dinner spots, the best 
museums to visit, and the œcant miss spots in the city. I also was able to find a few œdiamonds in the rough 
regarding entertainment options that I never would have found anywhere else.
I would seriously recommend this option, for both financial reasons and to improve the quality of your excursion. 
Youll come back with so many awesome stories that are a direct result of renting an apartment.
3. Sightseeing Tips
Regarding your sightseeing, I would do your cursory research on the internet, but I would also invest in a 
guidebook. The Lonely Planet series turned out to be great for me, and Fodors also has a series of travel books.
Having a guidebook actually in your hands can be quite a lifesaver. It certainly was for me. I used it to get œun-lost 
a few times, and it helped me find some of the best tourist spots that I might have missed otherwise. Check into 
buying used guidebooks as well since youll probably only be using them one time. The prices for these guidebooks 
can actually be quite reasonable. Ultimately, not only will they drastically enhance your experience, but they will 
also provide you with some great money-saving tips.
4. Eating Out
The topic of eating out, to me, kind of goes hand in hand with your lodging choice. Usually, I opted for renting a 
place. Therefore, I always made sure that I had a kitchen where I was staying, and was able to save quite a bit by 
simply doing a little grocery shopping and eating some meals in my room. You may think this would take away from 
your overall experience, but it never really did for me. For example, if you visit a few local coffeehouses the first few 
mornings of your stay, is it really necessary to take your breakfast at these places every morning for the rest of your 
trip? I never felt so, and decided on some home-cooked meals instead. The savings can be substantial should you 
go this route.
It also gives your vacation an added touch in my opinion and gives you a taste of the œlocal life once again. 
Additionally, it can be a time saver, too. Running late for some type of performance? Try getting in and out of a 
restaurant in a large international tourist destination in a short period of time. Its just not going to happen. However, 
if you have food at home, you can whip up something quick and be on your way.
In Short
If you have the disposable income, I would highly recommend visiting another country. My visits overseas have 
given me memories that will last a lifetime. Also, you can do it without breaking the bank. Do your research and 
follow some of the tips I have listed above and you might be surprised at how reasonable international travel can 
be.

   Oct. 5, 2010 (Lexington Herald-Leader delivered by Newstex) --
Pearse Lyons was a busy man when the earthquake shook Haiti in January; he was running a global biotechnology 
company and getting ready to host the            Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games.
But Lyons was shaken, too. After flying down to see the devastation for himself, the founder and president of 
Nicholasville-based Alltech decided the best thing he could do for Haiti was to create jobs to help the long-
impoverished nation build a sustainable future.
The company started a Haitian fair-trade coffee business, adopted a school and worked with the University of 
Kentucky Opera Theatre program to create a childrens choir, bringing 24 children up to sing at the Games.
If there was any doubt that Alltechs Haitian Harmony project has taken on a life of its own, you just had to be at UKs 
Singletary Center on Tuesday night when the world-famous Irish band The Chieftains and their musical friends from 
Ireland, Lexington, Nashville, New York and Canada joined with the singing Haitian children for a benefit concert 
that rocked the house.
œWhen you get an invitation like this, you cant refuse, said Paddy Maloney, who has led The Chieftains for nearly a 
half-century. œThis was our way to help. The thing hasnt gone away; (Haitis) just as bad as ever.
œIts a pitty we didnt have another day to rehearse so we could have done some Haitian music, Maloney said, 
adding with a wink: œBut it was a hell of a show.
Lyons said Maloney and friends agreed to donate their services after Shane Ryan, who owns Lexingtons Castleton 
Lyons farm and Europes biggest discount airline, Ryanair, agreed to fly The Chieftains over from Ireland on a 
The Chieftains & friends boost Haiti aid effort
private jet. Irish tenor Ronan Tynan, who performed at the Games opening ceremonies, returned from a gig in 
Florida to join the benefit.
œWe had a meeting of the Irish minds, Lyons said, adding that his brothers John and Lorcan helped with the 
arrangements. The Chieftains got to see the Games cross-country competition Saturday before a private dinner 
downtown with Irelands equestrian team.
œThe hospitality has been just amazing, Maloney said.
Lyons expected the benefit concert to raise more awareness than money, although many in the audience bought 
Alltechs Haitian coffee and made donations on their way out.
The childrens choir returns to Haiti on Thursday, and Lyons and UK Opera Theatre director Everett McCorvey have 
been thinking the same thing many others have: How will these children ever be able to cope back home after 
having such an amazing trip?
œI have a personal responsibility for these 24 children, Lyons said. œTheres an outpouring of compassion for 
these children, but at the end of it we have to give them a future. They will have an education. We will follow 
through.
There is talk of scholarship funds for them and others, of a traveling choir and ways to expand the concept to other 
Haitian schools, but nothing has been decided. With this concert and others, Lyons hopes to have recruited lots of 
help.
œThe audience was really with us, Lyons said, œand that was the important thing.

   Oct. 3, 2010 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Earlier this week, 10 million Spanish workers went on strike to protest changes to workers rights and pensions. As 
usual, the strike shut down airports, forcing most European air carriers to cancel their flights. Once the strike was 
over, it took several days for things to get back to normal. 
As airlines struggled to get enough planes back to Spain to pick up passengers, both Ryanair and            Easyjet 
had a bad message for their customers - you can fly with us, but you can't bring your luggage with you. 
Most of the passengers were given absolutely no warning about this, while others only got a few hours notice. As 
tired vacationers struggled to find ways to get their possessions sent home, others had to give up and just leave 
their things at their hotels, without the chance of ever seeing them again. 
One passenger left over $1,500 worth of clothes in Gran Canaria, a very quick way to completely spoil what was 
supposed to be a fun vacation. As is becoming common with low cost carriers, they showed that they really don't 
care by saying little more than "sorry for the inconvenience".

   Oct. 1, 2010 (The Orange Rag delivered by Newstex) -- 
 More random round-up than usual this week, as still slightly spaced out from flying (well obviously I didn't drive) trip 
to New York -- arrived Tuesday 9:00pm, flew back out Wednesday 6:00pm -- and seemed to spend an inordinate 
amount of time hanging around Irish airport transit lounges -- I was flying via Aer Lingus. (And my admiration to the 
man I saw eating fish 'n' chips with a pint of Guinness at Shannon Airport at 5:00am on Thursday morning.) So what 
did we learn?
-- The object of the exercise was to cover a Richard Susskind lecture on the Wednesday -- full report in next week's 
American Legal Technology Insider.
-- However we also learned that Aer Lingus may be awfully nice and helpful as an airline -- but they do seem to 
have fallen on hard times. You now have to buy your own booze -- and breakfast as the end of a long haul flight 
was a carton of orange juice. Er, that's it. Oh, ambassador you are spoiling us. Perhaps they are preparing 
themselves for Ryanair.
-- Not surprisingly, the flights were primarily full of Irish people and -- after helping one elderly lady load her carry-on 
luggage into the overhead locker --  I was told that for that act of kindness I was going straight to heaven. "Madam, 
" I replied, "being told they are going straight to heaven is the last thing anyone wants to hear at the start of a 
transatlantic flight." And, talking of carry-on luggage, at the New York departure gate, there was a mountain of 
booze & cigarettes the passengers had bought in duty-free and were taking home. And by mountain I mean the 
average off-licence doesn't stock that much food and drink. There again, everyone one I spoke to on the flight said 
the current state of the Irish economy now made Albania sound an attractive place to live.
-- I had an interesting chat with my US oppo Monica Bay of ALM's Law Technology News -- she recommends 
Angry Birds as an addictive game for the Apple iPad and suggested watching TwiT TV's new podcast series -- iPad 
Today -- available free of charges from iTunes as the ideal way to keep up with the latest iPad development news
Something for the weekend - in a New York state of mind
http://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/ipad-today/id381972795
-- I also tested out the theory that if you make a fleeting -- in one day, out the next -- trip to another timezone, you 
don't suffer from jet-lag because your body clock remains on its 'home' setting and hasn't had time to start shifting 
to another zone. Sounds a good idea -- and possibly might work if I could ever master the secret of sleeping on a 
plane, so I don't get back home feeling wrecked after being up for 23 hours in a row.
-- I also bring you news of a new game, you can play in hotels or office block where they have banks of 
elevators/lifts facing each other -- it's called Verticruising and the idea is you race someone in another lift to the 
same floor. The game starts by each player pressing the floor they are going to, then it is all down to how fast your 
respective doors close -- and whether someone else calls your lift en-route. (Yes, I know that does reveal in Norfolk, 
where nothing much ever happens and we have to make our own entertainment.)
-- Finally, a little diet tip I picked up from a woman who, it just so happened, I was having cocktails & dinner with on 
Wednesday night. She said that the secret to her looks was to never eat anything after 2:00pm on a day when it 
was still warm enough to wear a bikini. I shall make this my mantra from now on.

   Sep. 30, 2010 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Looks like the Russians managed to beat Ryanair to claiming the dubious honor of being the first airline with 
standing room only. 
On a Tatarstan airlines flight from Antalya (           Turkey) to Ekaterinburg (           Russia), passengers were told 
that the flight was full, and that they'd need to stand if they wanted to get to their destination. 
In total, six adults did not get a seat - which means they were also without a life jacket and oxygen mask, not to 
mention the possibility that the plane would not have enough bags of pretzel snack mix for them. 
Apparently, the original plane with 148 seats had been switched out at the last minute for a plane with 142 seats. In 
any normal situation, the airline would "bump" the six passengers and leave them behind, but I guess telling people 
to just shut up and find somewhere to stand is much cheaper. 
Of course, the passengers are now demanding compensation from the airline, expecting just under $5,000 for the 
experience of having to stand. Look at the bright side - if told to stand, you won't have to worry about a middle seat, 
and there won't be any arguments over the armrests.

   Sep. 27, 2010 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 What could possibly be next? Absent Ryanair-style fee insanity, there seems to be little the            airlines can do 
to our wallets now. Blankets, bags and beverages are just the tip of the iceberg: it seems anything that can come at 
a price does. The only thing missing is a seemingly well-intentioned Congress that wants its share of the airlines' 
recently found largess. 
Make no mistake about it: extra fees translate to real money for airlines. Last year, they amounted to $7.9 billion in 
the United States, and in the second quarter of 2010,            the top six airlines in the country picked up $2.1 billion. 
Following the effects of the 2008            financial crisis, this is cash these companies desperately needed to collect. 
This is where            Congress enters the picture. Right now, the government scores a 7.5 percent on fares. By 
effectively unbundling certain "amenities" - like checked baggage - from the fares, the airlines can charge lower 
prices, with the ancillary stuff charged on a pay-to-play basis. In the end, the feds are stuck with a smaller revenue 
base to tax. And, the airlines are able to bypass the excise tax, and boost their profits a bit.

   Sep. 26, 2010 (Plane Buzz delivered by Newstex) --
Hello earthlings.
It's that time again. Time for this week's issue of PlaneBusiness Banter.
Subscribers can access this week's issue            here.
Last week we were honored to deliver the luncheon speech at the third annual The Beat Live Conference in 
Chicago.
Right off the bat Jay Campbell and the rest of the folks at ProMedia made news of their own, as it was announced 
that ProMedia, the parent company of The Beat, and its related business travel publications, had been acquired by 
Northstar Travel Media.
Northstar currently owns both Travel Weekly and Business Travel News.
After all that news was digested -- it was time for the show.
As I have told readers in the past, the reason I am such a big fan of The Beat Live is because of the people who go 
to the conference. Confrontation is encouraged and embraced. This is not a "polite" gathering. People are not afraid 
to speak their mind. This is a good thing.
If it has anything to do with corporate travel, it was probably discussed. The biggest problem I had this week was 
trying to decide what exactly to write about. There was way too much to choose from.
PlaneBusiness Banter Now Posted
But aside from my traipsing around the country, it was a fairly heavy news week.
American Airlines jolted the markets Wednesday when they announced guidance for the third quarter that was 
below expectations. While the airline should still post a profit for the quarter, it will post a loss for the year.
On the international front, we talk about the interesting comments made by Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary this past 
week about why it is the Ryanair model may now begin to change. If you want an idea of what he is talking about -- 
think Southwest Airlines.
Then there was the bizarre fine imposed on United by the DOT last week. Of course we are talking about that. 
Speaking of United and Continental -- this coming Friday is the big day! Unless something unforeseen happens 
between now and then, the two airlines will close on their merger Friday.
Analyst Dan McKenzie with Hudson Securities talks about why investors should not be concerned with Delta's 
increase in fourth quarter capacity (hint: the power of the airline's Tokyo hub).
Union votes? The big AFA representational election begins this week for the Delta Air Lines' flight attendants. I give 
you my take on what they should do and why.
Then there is that DOT proposal that would see new rules concerning passengers, fees, denied boarding payments 
and more. The public comment period ended this last week. Our stance? Transparency yes. But these are 
commercial items that do not lend themselves easily to heavy-handed governmental regulation.
There is a lot more that we're talking about this week. You just need to subscribe to find out!

   Sep. 24, 2010 (The Economist delivered by Newstex) --
MICHAEL O'LEARY, the boss of Ryanair, shows his softer side in an            interview with Bloomberg.
œAt the moment its all about price, price, price, but as you slow down the growth rate youre doing less discounting 
to fill seats, he [Mr O'Leary] said. œYour focus is more on ˜most-on-time airline in Europe, the fewest bags lost, 
brand-new aircraft, all-leather seating -- the carey-sharey stuff.
All-leather seating? Carey-sharey stuff? Has hell frozen over as well?
Mr O'Leary also suggests that Ryanair is to alter its policy of operating from airports away from urban centres and 
will seek slots at all of Europe's bigger facilities, with the exception of London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle 
and Frankfurt am Main.
Costlier airports are also becoming viable as Ryanair reduces its use of facilities such as check-in desks and 
baggage-handling machines in response to customers registering for flights electronically and carrying hand 
luggage, OLeary said. That has cut entry expenses and kept ticket prices lower.
And unlike the paying-for-toilets, standing-passengers themes that Mr O'Leary is so fond of pursuing, these 
projections seem likely to happen”and they're also surprisingly passenger-friendly.

 There will be no RyanAir flights at Frankfurt/Hahn due to resurfacing of the runway from 5 p.m. September 20 to 
12:30 p.m. on September 23, 2010.
The airport decided on this solution because the work could be done faster in the daylight hours of those days, 
rather than trying to do the job piecemeal at night over an extended period of time. This has turned out to be a 
brilliant solution weather-wise because Germany right now is enjoying a period of Indian Summer with clear skies, 
bright sun and balmy temperatures, so that one presumes that the runway will be resurfaced under optimal 
conditions. News reports indicate the new runway should be good then for the next 15 years.
The Official website of the airport Frankfurt-Hahn reports as follows:
"Closure of the runway
There´s no air traffic due to building measures between 20.09.10, 5 p.m. and 23.09.10, 12:30 p.m.
Affected passengers are already informed from their airlines.
The passenger terminal is closed from 20.09.10, 6 p.m. till 23.09.10, 09:30 a.m.
We want to ask for you understanding. Thank you!"

New York, September 17th (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (OOTC:RYAOF)  
(NASDAQ:RYAAY) are trading very close to calculated resistance at $30.59 with the current price action closing at 
just $30.24 placing the stock near levels that make it difficult to buy.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's current stock range is defined by current calculated support defined at $28.19 and by the resistance level 
at $30.59, the stock is clearly over-extended from support, making it difficult to establishing new long positions at 
this level.
Traders don't have a clear entry point for Ryanair, as the stock is well above support, however, as the stock pulls 
back towards $28.19 it will definitely provide a reference point to establish a trade. On the other hand if the stock 
decides to break above resistance level at $30.59 then traders will get an opportunity to enter Ryanair stock by 
establishing a position as the stock moves to a higher range.

Forget the full horizontal position of a first class seat on a trans-Atlantic flight. How about a partial standing seat 
instead?
 Aviointeriors is introducing the SkyRider - a "ultra-high density" seat that has as 23-inch seat pitch (or less, the 
company says) - at the Aircraft Interiors Expo Americas 2010 this week in Long Beach, Calif. Seat pitch is the 
distance between the same point on two seats.
            "The SkyRider has been designed and engineered to offer the possibility to even further reduce ticket prices 
while still maintaining sound profitability, which, even with a dual or three class seating arrangement will allow 
maximum certified passenger capacity of the aircraft," the company's website says. "With a much reduced seat 
pitch, the SkyRider preserves a comfortable position for the low fare passengers."
            According to Seatguru.com, even low-fare carrier Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV)  has a seat pitch of 32 to 
33 inches on its Boeing (NYSE:BA)  737s. Think about what 10 less inches would mean for most people, not to 
mention the "to fat to fly" passengers that some airlines require to purchase two seats.
            No one has ordered these seats yet, but if Ryanair is talking about charging for using the toilets, it may not 
be long before budget carriers decide to snap up these almost upright chairs.

The CEO of Europe's largest airline Ryanair has called global warming "bullshit" and "horseshit" in an            
interview with the Irish Independent.
Michael O'Leary's scathing assault on the scientific theory targeted not just the idea of global warming itself, but 
those who perpetuate it.
From the Irish Independent:
Do I believe there is global warming? No, I believe it's all a load of bullshit. But it's amazing the way the whole 
fucking eco-warriors and the media have changed. It used to be global warming, but now, when global 
temperatures haven't risen in the past 12 years, they say 'climate change'.
O'Leary didn't hold back, targeting the entire scientific community for being wrong throughout history, and the 
weather on a regular basis.
The scientific community has nearly always been wrong in history anyway. In the Middle Ages, they were going to 
excommunicate Galileo because the entire scientific community said the Earth was flat... I mean, it is absolutely 
bizarre that the people who can't tell us what the fucking weather is next Tuesday can predict with absolute 
precision what the fucking global temperatures will be in 100 years' time. It's horseshit.

   Sep. 10, 2010 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 An Italian company, Aviointeriors, has designed and patented what it calls a "stand-up" airline seat, and 
representatives from the company have told            Travel Weekly that some airlines are interested in them. But 
don't panic at the media reports: You won't be using them anytime soon.
The spindly-looking seats, as you can see, do not force passengers to stand fully erect. Instead, they provide for a 
half-sitting, half-leaning carriage, although the feet must be on the floor for it to function as designed. The "pitch," or 
distance between the front of the seat and the back of the next row, is only 23 inches.
Aviointeriors proposes that airlines stuff as many "SkyRider" seats into  cabins that maximum occupancy rules will 
allow, and charge a lower  price for them than is charged for traditional seats.
More  passenger revenue would be good for airlines. And lower airfare could be  good for consumers. But there are 
several significant stumbling blocks  in the way of the SkyRider's eventual implementation.
    Only the most skilled contortionist could manage to sleep in one
    They will likely not be comfortable for long-haul flights
    Most importantly, FAA must approve the seats before they go into service in American skies
I covered the issue last year  after the Irish cheapie flyer, Ryanair, scored another cheap publicity  hit by threatening 
to install standing-room-only areas on its aircraft.  The Federal Aviation Administration maintains, in its            
Airworthiness Standards code, Title 14, 23.785: "There must be a seat or berth for each occupant." 
In addition, each passenger has to be assigned a restraint system that  "must be designed to support occupants 
weighing at least 215 pounds."  Your own two feet, then, presumably don't count, since in Aviointerior's  SkyRider 
seats, a significant proportion of support comes from the  passengers themselves.
Could the FAA change its seating codes?  Of course, but not without some uproar. In addition, packing more  
passengers onto airplanes could be deemed a safety risk, and at the very  least most airlines would have to employ 
more flight attendants to  supervise the safety of the additional people, and that costs money.
Stand-up airline seats are here, but you won't use one soon
European safety officials have already rebuffed Ryanair's earlier  attempt to add standing seats, and Airbus has 
been trying for years to  kick off legal            standing-room flights in Asia,  but so far, not a single Asian government 
has gone for the idea of  cramming that many people on a plane. If you've even taken the subway in  Tokyo at rush 
hour, that's really saying something.

representatives from the company have told            Travel Weekly that some airlines are interested in them. But 
don't panic at the media reports: You won't be using them anytime soon.
The spindly-looking seats, as you can see, do not force passengers to stand fully erect. Instead, they provide for a 
half-sitting, half-leaning carriage, although the feet must be on the floor for it to function as designed. The "pitch," or 
distance between the front of the seat and the back of the next row, is only 23 inches.
Aviointeriors proposes that airlines stuff as many "SkyRider" seats into cabins that maximum occupancy rules will 
allow, and charge a lower price for them than is charged for traditionally supportive seats.
More passenger revenue would be good for airlines. And lower prices for airfare could be good for consumers. But 
there are several significant stumbling blocks in the way of the SkyRider's eventual implementation.
    Only the most skilled contortionist could manage to sleep in one
    They will likely not be comfortable for long-haul flights over many hours
    Most importantly, FAA must approve the seats before they go into service in American skies
I covered the issue last year after the Irish cheapie flyer, Ryanair, scored another cheap publicity hit by threatening 
to install standing-room-only seat on its aircraft. The Federal Aviation Administration maintains, in its            
Airworthiness Standards code, Title 14, 23.785: "There must be a seat or berth for each occupant." 
In addition, each passenger must be assigned a restraint system that "must be designed to support occupants 
weighing at least 215 pounds." Your own two feet, then, presumably don't count, since in Aviointerior's SkyRider 
seats, a significant proportion of support comes from the passengers themselves.
Could the FAA change its seating codes? Of course, but not without some uproar. In addition, packing more 
passengers onto airplanes could be deemed a safety risk, and at the very least most airlines would have to employ 
more flight attendants to supervise the safety of the additional people, and that costs money.
Stand-up airlines seats are here, but you won't use one soon
European safety officials have already rebuffed Ryanair's earlier attempt to add standing seats, and Airbus has 
been trying for years to kick off legal            standing-room flights in Asia, but so far, not a single Asian government 
has gone for the idea of cramming that many people on a plane. If you've even taken the subway in Tokyo at rush 
hour, that's really saying something.

At the 2010 International Legal Technology Conference session œA New View of the Automated Law Firm", my co-
panelists and I discussed how changing market dynamics and technology might force firms to become either a 
œLaw Factory or a œBet the Farm firm. With this post, I inaugurate a new blog category to continue that 
exploration..  
  
Gerard Neiditsch, Executive Director Business Integration and Technology, Mallesons Stephen Jaques; Jeffrey 
Rovner, Managing Director for Information, OMelveny & Myers LLP; and Mary Abraham, Counsel, Debevoise & 
Plimpton LLP, and I presented at ILTA in Las Vegas on Aug 25, 2010 (INFO11, #INFO11 hashtag).
  
We postulated that firms would gravitate toward poles on a spectrum: œbet the farm firms focusing on high-stakes 
matters versus œlaw factory firms focusing on run of the mill cases. Think œhand crafted versus œindustrial 
processes. For more information, see our slides A New View of the Automated Law Firm or read the blog posts 
summarizing the session:            Legal Current post by Andrew McLennan-Murray, Applications Integrator, 
Thomson Reuters, Legal and            Hubbard One post by Charlie Vanek.
  
Two recent Business Week articles (Sept 6-12) prompted thinking about this theme.            Ryanairs OLeary: The 
Duke of Discomfort explains how the CEO of Ryanair, Michael OLeary, œis remaking commercial flights in his 
image: shabby, crabby, and cheap, cheap, cheap. At one time, all airlines thought of themselves of high end and 
exclusive, charging high prices and offering comfort. Ryanair reverses the model, doing whatever it can to bring 
price down, eliminating comfort as a byproduct of doing so.
  
OLeary illustrates that re-thinking an established product or service changes the game. The moral is not that 
prestigious BigLaw firms should cheap down service. Rather, its that the accepted wisdom about what clients want 
may be wrong. What looks like a single market may have many segments. Bet-the-farm BigLaw firms may find that 
Law Factory versus Bet the Farm Firm - learning from business
some of their practices need to be more like Ryanair. In our preparation and during the panel, we struggled with the 
question whether these law-factory practices could survive in bet-the-farm firms. For whatever its worth, in the 
airline industry, high-end and discount cannot seem to co-exist in the same company.
  
           P&G Looks to Franchise Tide Dry Cleaning offers a seemingly opposite lesson. It explains that Procter & 
Gamble will franchise the Tide detergent brand to local dry cleaners. Here, a widely-recognized and trusted brand 
will try to bring order and consistency to œa fragmented market where consumer expectations arent high. 
(Personally, Ive never seen a dry cleaner I liked.) A potential lesson here for BigLaw is that their brand names may 
bring value to some law factory work that has, to date, left clients unsatisfied. But just as P&G (NYSE:PG)  faces 
risk in extending its brand, so too would BigLaw. And note that P&G is not going directly into the dry cleaning 
business; franchising off-loads the operations. That model is likely not easily available for law practice.
  
The business world offers many models and experiments. Whether we really see a dichotomy of firms is an open 
question but it would be shocking if we did not see more variation in the future than we have in the past.

           Global-Bank Deal Targets Reserves (WSJ)
 Regulators have said new rules will help restore confidence in the global banking system. Banks have warned that 
such requirements could limit economic growth by crimping their ability to lend. Many bankers had believed their 
arguments were gaining traction, but the new limits regulators appear close to mandating are stiffer than some had 
expected in recent days.
Boehner Calls For Two Year Freeze On All Tax Rates (AP)
 House Republican Leader John Boehner onWednesday proposed a two-year freeze on all tax rates and a cut in 
government spending to the levels of 2008, before a deep recession took hold of the economy. In a broadcast 
interview, the Ohio Republican said he was offering a œbipartisan alternative to the package of business tax 
incentives and infrastructure spending that President Barack Obama was slated to announce later Wednesday in 
Cleveland.

 The market value of emerging-market stocks may surge more than fivefold to $80 trillion in two decades, 
overtaking developed nations, as China becomes the worlds largest stock market, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)  
said. Faster economic expansion and growing capital markets may lift emerging nations share of world equity 
capitalization to 55 percent by 2030 from 31 percent today, Goldman strategists led by Timothy Moe wrote in a

           SEC Looking At ˜Quote Stuffing (WSJ)
 Mary Schapiro said the agency is looking at a practice others have called œquote stuffing to assess whether it 
violates œexisting rules against fraudulent or other improper behavior. The practice involves trading in which 
unusually large numbers of orders to buy or sell stocks are placed in a fraction of a second, only to be canceled 
almost immediately. Ms. Schapiro said the agency is considering requiring traders to hold orders open for minimum 
periods.

 œWhy does every plane have two pilots? asks Michael OLeary, chief executive officer of Ryanair Holdings Plc 
(OOTC:RYAOF)  (NASDAQ:RYAAY) , the largest low-cost airline in Europe. Wearing sneakers, jeans, and an off-
the-rack short-sleeved shirt, OLeary is pontificating in his office at the companys headquarters on the outskirts of 
Dublin Airport. œReally, you only need one pilot, he tells Bloomberg Businessweek in the Sept. 6 edition. œLets 
take out the second pilot. Let the bloody computer fly it. What happens if the pilot has a heart attack? One member 
of the cabin crew on all Ryanair flights would be trained to land a plane. œIf the pilot has an emergency, he rings 
the bell, he calls her in, OLeary says. œShe could take over.

           Hurd To Get $950,000, Eligible For $5 Million Bonus At Oracle (AP)
 The biggest part of Hurds pay package will be the 10 million stock options Oracle plans to give him. The company 
said Hurds options will carry an exercise price equal to the market value of the shares  on the date they are 
granted. While the filing did not offer a specific date, Oracle shares closed Tuesday at $24.26, which would value 
10 million shares at $242.6 million. If he stays with the company, Hurd will be given options to buy another 5 million 
shares each year for the next five years.

           We have followed the dubious work of Michael OLeary, chief executive officer of Ryanair as he has struggled 
to make aircraft into human cattle cars and to charge from every possible convenience like use of a toilet.  
Demonstrating that he has even less regard for safety than he does comfort, OLeary is calling for the elimination of 
co-pilots ” suggesting that flight attendants could be trained to land planes where a pilot dies or becomes 
incapacitated.
OLeary insisted œReally, you only need one pilot . . . Lets take out the second pilot. Let the bloody computer fly it.   
To assure those people willing to trust him with their lives, OLeary that œ[i]f the pilot has an emergency, he rings 
the bell, he calls her in. She could take over.
There appear plenty of people who are willing to be treated like cattle or fly on a cut-rate airline where co-pilots are 
treated like luxuries.   Ryanair now has 7,000 employees, flying 1,100 routes to 155 airports in 26 countries.

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary is making the news again. And as usual, the news is controversial and absurd. 
O'Leary is apparently fed up with paying for two people to fly his planes, and wants to convince safety regulators 
that one pilot would be more than enough. In a magazine interview, O'Leary had the following to say:
Why does every plane have two pilots? Really, you only need one pilot. Let's take out the second pilot. Let the 
bloody computer fly it.
When asked what would happen in an emergency, leaving the plane without a pilot, he replied that specially trained 
flight attendants could assist:
If the pilot has an emergency, he rings the bell, he calls her in. She could take over.
Of course, pilots and their unions are furious, as it tries to paint a picture that planes fly themselves and don't really 
need anyone at the controls. A spokesman for the British Airline Pilots Association said: 
Are there no lengths to which he will not go to get publicity? His suggestion is unwise, unsafe and the public will be 
horrified.
After O'Leary made the news with proposals for a paid bathroom,            standing room and long haul flights            
with free oral sex, you almost have to question his sanity. Still, he can't be all that crazy, as his airline is one of the 
most profitable in the world. Earlier this year, British Airways took a reverse approach when they retrained some of 
their pilots to work as flight attendants during a strike. 
What do you think? Is this another publicity stunt, or could his airline actually save millions by removing the co-pilot?

   Sep. 6, 2010 (The Financial Services Club Blog delivered by Newstex) --
 At the end of August, the LSE had a            fat finger moment, when five stocks suddenly experienced wild swings 
which some attributed to the fact that the stocks began with the letters U, H, B and N, which happen to be adjacent 
to each other on the keyboard.
This follows the ˜flash crash of May 2010, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 6% of its value in a few 
minutes and some believe it was due to a traders fat finger hitting the billion button instead of a million, although 
there is no evidence to support this.
 Inspired by such moments, here are a few other fat finger moments:
Japanese trader makes £22 billion mistake (February 2009)A trader working in the Japanese branch of the Swiss 
bank UBS (NYSE:UBS)  mistakenly ordered £22 billion of bonds while trying to buy just £220,000.Morgan Stanley 
fined for $11 billion mistake (February 2007)The New York Stock Exchange said on Wednesday it has fined 
Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)  (MS.N) $300,000 for its failure to stop a trader from entering an order to buy $10.8 
billion in stocks, instead of the $10.8 million that was intended, an error that disrupted trading in nearly 700 listed 
stocks in 2004.
Heads up at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)  (September 2006) 
A Bank of America traders keyboard was set up to execute an order when the senior trader gave the signal ” he just 
had to press enter. Roughhousing traders tossed a rugby ball in his direction, which landed on his keyboard and 
executed the $50m trade ahead of schedule.
 Oops! Citigroup (NYSE:C)  did it again (January 2006) 
 Citigroup was investigated by the UK Financial Services Authority for the second time in 18 months after a trader at 
Nikko Citigroup intended to buy two shares in Nippon Paper at ¥502,000. Instead he input an order for 2,000 
shares.Trainee costs Mizuho $224m (December 2005) 
It's not just Sumo Wrestlers with Fat Fingers
 Japans Mizuho Securities let a 20-year-old trainee to input large trades even though hed only been there for two 
weeks. Instead of buying one share of J:Com at ¥610,000, he ordered 610,000 shares at ¥1 each. This was 41 
times J:Coms outstanding stock. The Japanese market dropped 2% and Mizuho lost $224m.Record Sales 
(February 2005) A broker tried to sell 15,000 shares in music publisher EMI at 280¼p but instead placed an order 
for 15 million in a transaction worth £41.5 million.Currencies Exchanged (November 2002)A market maker confused 
the price of Ryanair shares in euros and sterling, sending the London quote up more than 61 per cent, from 404.5p 
to 653.7p.DAX the way, I dont like it (September 2002)A Eurex trader intended to sell one futures contract when the 
DAX, Germany's index of leading shares, reached 5,180. Instead, he sold 5,180 contracts, sending the market into 
a free fall. Five hours later, the exchange announced the cancellation of a raft of other trades.Bear sends markets 
plunging (October 2002) 
 A trader at US bank Bear Stearns was blamed for a 100-point fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after he 
entered a $4bn sell order instead of a $4m order. More than $600m of stock changed hands before the mistake was 
detected. The days 183-point slump was blamed on the traders error. UBS Warburg is made to look sheepish 
(December 2001) 
 A UBS Warburg trader selling 16 shares in Japanese advertising giant Dentsu at ¥600,000 (??3,900) instead sold 
610,000 at ¥6 ” hours before UBS was to lead Dentsus IPO. The order was cancelled but not before 64,915 shares, 
almost half of the 135,000 shares in the Tokyo listing, had been sold. UBS Warburg lost up to $100m when it was 
forced to buy the shares it sold.Lehman Brothers fingered (May 2001) 
 A London based Lehman Brothers trader wiped £30bn (??44bn) off the FTSE 100 in 2001 when he ordered sales 
of shares in blue-chip companies, such as BP and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) , that were 100 times larger than 
intended. He keyed in £300m instead of £3m for a trade, causing a 120-point drop in the index and a £20,000 fine 
for Lehman Brothers.Londons biggest order (February 2001) 
 The LSE had to cancel its biggest trade in history after a clumsy trader placed an order for £8.1bn (??11.8bn)

LSE source as ˜clearly an inputting error and was cancelled almost as soon as it hit the order book.£80bn Swiss

 A careless UBS equity specialist executed the worlds single biggest share trade when he bought and sold nearly

 A bad workman blames his keyboard (October 1998) 
 Salomon Brothers sold 10,000 futures contracts on French derivatives exchange Matif. An independent audit

 A schoolboy error (September 1997) 
 A trader entered Zenecas Sedol (CUSIP) number, the six-figure code used by the exchange to identify stocks,

   Sep. 3, 2010 (Zacks Investment Research delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Boeing Company (           BA), with a steady recovery in the U.S. and Canadian economies, dreams big for its 
commercial airlines business. The bullishness was reflected in Boeing's (NYSE:BA)  2010 North America (U.S. and 
Canada) market outlook forecast on September 2, 2010. Boeing forecasts that air carriers in North America will take 
delivery of about 7,200 new airplanes over the next 20 years at an investment of $700 billion.
Paradigm Shift
Boeing forecast a paradigm shift to the fortunes of the U.S. and Canadian airliners with the continuing recovery of 
the global economy leading to a steady improvement in demand for air travel as well as cargo. In the first half of 
fiscal 2010, the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 3%. Going forward, we expect above-trend growth and a 
slowly declining unemployment rate.
In the second half of 2010, our forecast of GDP growth is only slightly lower, at about 2.8%. Earlier, Boeings 
commercial airplane deliveries were badly affected by cancellations and deferments from its airliner customers 
badly affected by the worldwide recession.
However, the tables have turned now with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasting 2010 
global passenger traffic growth of 7%. Also, air cargo traffic is expected to grow 19% in 2010. This will benefit the 
entire airline industry including Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) companies like Republic Airways Holdings Inc. (RJET) 
and Ryanair Holdings plc (OOTC:RYAOF)  (NASDAQ:RYAAY)  (           RYAAY).
To catch up with the expected rise in air traffic, airliners will need to retire older airplanes to maintain capacity. 
Taking retirements of airplanes into account, Boeing estimates the fleet size of U.S. and Canadian Airliners will 
grow from the current 6,590 airplanes to about 9,000 airplanes by 2029.
Boeing Dreams Big - Analyst Blog
Boeing Flying High
Of the $700 billion pie Boeing expects, airliners' choice for new airplanes will be skewed towards single-aisle, fuel 
efficient, environment friendly airlines. Airlines are increasingly focusing on the ages of its airplanes as fuel-thirsty, 
older planes weigh increasingly on earnings. Increased attention to aviation's impact on global climate change also 
will be a factor in selecting airplanes that produce lower carbon emissions.
Boeing forecasts that single-aisle airplanes, currently consisting of 56% of the total U.S. and Canadian airliners 
fleet, will grow to 71% of the fleet by 2029. The Boeing 737 Next Generation is a short-to-medium range, single-
aisle, and narrow body jet airliner pitted against the Airbus A320.
Earlier, Boeings Commercial Airplane segment in the second quarter of 2010 saw a stark 9% drop in deliveries to 
114 units. A lower number of 737 and 777 airplanes flew out of Boeing without a single 747 during the quarter. As a 
result, Boeings quarter revenue has dropped 12% to $7.4 billion. The segmental operating margin contracted to 
9.2% from 9.7% in the year-ago quarter due to lower new airplane deliveries.
Within the North America market, Boeing also sees a demand for 1,180 new, efficient twin-aisle airplanes such as 
the 787 Dreamliner. Boeings 787 is the first passenger jetliner of which the major portion will be manufactured from 
lightweight and environmentally friendly composite material -- a break from traditional materials like aluminum and 
titanium that were generally used for manufacturing. The new airplane of the company will also be fuel efficient, 
consuming 20% less fuel than those of its peers.
Outlook
Boeing has a unique position as the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world in terms of revenue, orders and 
deliveries, and as one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the world. Also, its revenue exposure is 
spread across more than 90 countries around the globe.
However in the near-term, headwinds over 787 delays -- along with expected cutbacks in the U.S. Defense budget -
- looms large over the fortunes of Boeing, similar to its large-cap defense prime peers like Lockheed Martin 
Corporation (           LMT) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (           NOC). We are Neutral for the time being on 
Boeing, currently retaining a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold rating).

airlines trading higher.
Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) is the top performer of the sector so far, trading at $46.35 representing 2.52%. versus the 
previous trading session. Shares of Alaska Air , the Airline serving destinations within the state of Alaska and the 
West Coast of the United States have defined support at $43.89 and resistance at $54.19.
US Airways (NYSE:LCC) is also among the top performers, currently trading at $9.75 representing 1.99% from its 
previous close. US Airways, the Phoenix based airline has calculated support and resistance levels at $8.40 and 
$9.53 respectively. The other top performer is UAL (NASDAQ:UAUA), which is trading at $22.32 representing 
1.78% from the previous trading session.
The sector's worst performers include SkyWest (NASDAQ:SKYW) that is trading at $13.18 or -1.75% from the 
previous close. Shares of SkyWest, the regional airline servicing major airlines like Delta (NYSE:DAL)  and United 
have defined support at $11.97 and resistance at $13.62. Also among the worst performers is Ryanair 
(NASDAQ:RYAAY), which is currently trading at $29.17 representing -0.31% from the previous trading session.
Benchmark crude for October delivery is trading lower trading at $73.46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange lower by $-0.97 from the previous trading session. Crude prices are closely watched by traders as they 
usually correlate with the airline stocks, given that a big component of the airlines' cost structure is covered by the 
price of fuel.

 When wackiness hits the European skies, it's usually safe to guess that Ryanair is somehow involved. A British 
plane from this discount carrier had to land in            Germany - rather than in            Poland, its intended 
destination - because            a passenger couldn't keep her tea in her cup.
The 56-year-old British woman spilled hot tea on herself, according to German police, forcing the flight from 
Liverpool to Poznan to make an unanticipated stop in Bremen. She was treated for scalding,            according to 
Reuters, and released. But, her plane left without her. So, she finished her journey by train, which was probably 
much more comfortable.
Hey, come to think it, even hot            tea on your lap is probably better than flying Ryanair ...

           Belfast City Airport will be hoping for better luck in September. Having run a couple of            Community 
Information Days last week that were advertised to 21,000 local homes but            only ended up attracting 42 
people into the airport terminal to learn more about the airports activities and plans for the runway extension, 
Ryanair broke bad news this morning.
Ryanair dont do subtle gestures, and in the case of the city airport theyre pulling their aircraft off the local tarmac 
from 1 November, ceasing the routes to Bristol, East Midlands, Liverpool, London Stansted and Prestwick from 31 
October.
At this mornings press conference in the Europa Hotel, Ryanair boss Michael OLeary said:
It is very disappointing that the promised runway extension at Belfast City Airport has still not materialised more 
than three years after we opened the base at Belfast City.
It makes no sense for Ryanair to continue to invest in Belfast City, operating restricted routes with less than full 
payloads between Belfast and other UK airports (which suffer a double APD penalty) unless there is clear and 
immediate prospect of Ryanair being enabled to safely operate longer European routes from Belfast City Airport 
and for this we need the runway extension.
The journey towards            a public inquiry looking at the proposed runway extension has been a long drawn out 
process, that was            delayed again in August.
Belfast City Airport waves goodbye to Ryanair ...; for now?
Its unlikely that OLearys intervention will speed up the process. More likely itll encourage easyJet to continue their 
bargaining between Belfast International and Belfast City airports and perhaps shift more flights down from 
Aldergrove to the harbour.
The airports Business Development Director, Katy Best said she was disappointed at Ryanairs decision. However:
Ryanairs announcement will not divert us in pursuing the continued development of the airport. Our goal still 
remains to attract new airlines and new destinations to and from Belfast City Airport resulting in a much needed 
economic boost for the region.
The extension would add 590 metres to the Holywood end of the runway would allow the existing aircraft to fly fully 
laden with passengers and fuel, offering destinations further afield in mainland Europe. The physical layout of the 
current airport site means that the longer runway wouldnt attract larger aircraft. The City Airports current planning 
constraint means it can operate no more than 48,000 flights each year. Last year they managed 39,328 flights 
carrying 2.60 million passengers; in 2008 they peaked at 42,998 flights for 2.56 million people.
While community and campaign groups like            Belfast City Airport Watch Ltd have voiced concerns and actively 
fought against the extension, their demands seem to stop short of requesting a radical cutback in the airports 
operations “ eg, halving the current flight limit. Perhaps the local jobs at stake make that an ask too far?
Sinn Féins local East Belfast representative Niall ?" Donnghaile commented:
While Im sure many residents will not be mourning the apparent loss of Ryanair, I think this move by Michael 
OLeary is an extremely retrograde step and will only punish Ryanair workers as well as the local economy and air 
travel commuters.
Dawn Purvis MLA reacted to Ryanairs announcement:
While it is regrettable, it is not surprising, Mr OLeary has long made his views known regarding the democratic right 
of the people of East Belfast to lodge their objections and lobby their elected representatives against a runway 
extension which would add to the already nuisance levels of noise and other forms of pollution. Mr OLeary probably 
needs reminded that we live in a democratic country not a fascist state where profit is more important than the 
health and well being of its citizens.
My major concern in all of this is that Mr OLearys ˜hissy fit does not cost jobs, I hope he has the decency to ensure 
that these employees can be redeployed elsewhere within Ryan Air operations.

Drug tourism in the Netherlands : Any lessons for California ?
Drug tourism in the Netherlands: Any lessons for California?

   Aug. 20, 2010 (The Reality-Based Community delivered by Newstex) --
The City of Maastricht is battling the European Union over whether it can            prevent drug tourism by having 
œcoffee shop sales restricted to Dutch citizens.  If the EU rules that Dutch coffee shops cannot deny cannabis 
sales to people from outside of the Netherlands, Maastricht may follow the lead of other Dutch border cities, which 
have simply closed their shops to get rid of drug tourism.  The EUs push for policy harmonization could thus lead to 
more restrictive cannabis policies in its member states (even as it has tended to open up access to alcohol).
One might wonder why the Dutch would not want drug tourism, given that governments normally do their best to 
lure tourists to visit and to spend money.  The coffee shop owners of course want drug tourists and the profits they 
bring.  But the rest of community endures more costs than benefits.
The central problem with drug tourism is one of selection: People who will travel even an hour to use drugs are not 
a random sample of all drug users.  The same principle applies to all those Brits who fly RyanAir to Spain for all-
you-can-drink weekend promotions at budget hotels, and the U.S. college kids on spring break who are drawn to 
similar offers in Mexico.  Cannabis users as a population are not particularly prone to vandalism, disorderly conduct, 
and petty theft, but the subpopulation of users that will take a trip (no pun intended) for cannabis often commit these 
crimes, creating nuisance, distress and policing costs for locals.
A further cost to the country that attracts drug tourists is how more serious criminals respond.  If you are a dealer in 
cocaine or ectstasy or methamphetamine, and you want to efficiently access a pool of probable customers, border 
towns with drug tourists are attractive bases of operations.  There you will find many young men who are by 
definition unusually interested in using drugs and are away from whatever social constraints and norms surround 
them at home.
Drug tourism in the Netherlands : Any lessons for California ?
If California legalizes marijuana, drug tourism would be substantial in border communities as well as in cities with 
budget airline service.   Being free from EU-like constraints, the state could try to reduce such tourism by limiting 
cannabis sales to state residents.   This however would make only a marginal difference unless state residents had 
a cap placed on how much cannabis they could buy (else they would simply buy a large amount and turn around 
and sell it at marginal profit to out of state drug tourists).  It would not be impossible to build a fairly strong 
regulatory system, but the needed policing would cost money (those putative savings of Proposition 19 are looking 
smaller all the time¦) and because the system would be imperfect, at least some California communities would 
endure the externalities of drug tourism that the people of Maastricht are facing now.

Ever heard of OpenSkies? Theyre the all business class airline formerly known as LAvion, renamed after being 
acquired by British Airways. For a little more than the cost of an economy ticket “ or sometimes a little less, 
depending on when you book, OpenSkies offers travelers between New York or Washington, DC and Paris an all 
business class flight. When you spot a fare on OpenSkies thats the same as the cost of an economy seat on a 
major airline, its certainly tempting. Throw in the 3 free checked bags you get (compared to the paltry one thats 
allowed on most international flights now), and for those who just cant seem to get everything a trip out of the 
country requires into one bag, it seems like a no-brainer.
At 6²1³, most flights consist of twisting my legs into uncomfortable, slanted positions so that I dont end up with the 
seatback bar digging into my knees and a tray table in my chest. The allure of legroom would have been enough, 
but combined with the fact that the fare was $40 less than the lowest, non-stop economy fare at the time, I decided 
to forgo more miles on my normal carrier (hello, Continental!) for an airline I hadnt heard much about before.
Now, Im rethinking that.
Not included? The hidden cost of service sacrifices
Keeping the cost of airfare down means something is sacrificed. Baggage allowances, food and plenty of other 
things have already disappeared from domestic flights. If youre flying RyanAir, you may sacrifice the convenience of 
flying into a major airport, and things like free toilet privileges. When tickets are $20 though, you chalk it up to the 
price of saving. Despite the marketing, with OpenSkies you also make sacrifices which can cost thousands of 
dollars, or even leave you stranded.
Open Skies Review: When Nobody Knows Your Airlines Name (How I Lost $1600 and Was Almost Stranded)
Checking In
Perhaps the most frustrating experience is checking in at Paris Orly. There are 2 daily flights to Newark, which 
means that costs are reduced by only renting gates on a part time basis. While airlines like Air Algerie, Aigle Azur 
and EasyJet have permanent, clearly marked signs, the OpenSkies check-in counters are obscured behind a 
magazine shop with no signs that would indicate to people passing by that the check-in desk is located behind the 
more prominently labeled store and other airlines. While the red and white of Air Algerie and the blue and white of 
Aigle Azur are clearly and prominently visible from a distance, theres nothing but a blank wall behind the Open 
Skies counter. The sole signage is a small logo on the screen at the gate “ a screen which is not visible from the 
airport entrance (its blocked by the magazine store). Add to that, to save on costs, OpenSkies contracts a 3rd party 
company to handle the check-in process, rather than actual employees of the company. The company who handles 
the check-in doesnt wear uniforms with the airline name on them, or anything with the airlines purple and gray color 
scheme, which makes it even more difficult to identify them as OpenSkies agents. Not surprisingly, even people 
who work at the airport arent always aware of the location of the check-in counter.
Why is it a problem? If for any reason youre tight on time, 15 minutes spent going back and forth through the 
terminal or taking a train to the other airport building after someone mistakenly suggests that the airline is in a 
different terminal adds up. In my case, the search added up to finding the counter approximately 20 minutes after 
check-in closed, but before the flight left.
If Problems Arise¦
Normally, if you miss a flight by a matter of minutes, an airline will place you on standby for the next available flight 
once you speak with an agent at the gate. Remember the money saving outsourcing of the check-in process? It 
also means, that if problems arise at the airport, the contracted agents dont have the authority to reschedule or 
rebook flights. Instead, all requests have to go through a call center, which doesnt have a direct connection to the 
gate, and is often only one person. A manager, supervisor or anyone who would be able to rebook a flight is 
conveniently never available. A request for the name of someone to address a letter to is met with refusal.
The end result? In my case, ??1200, or approximately $1600 at the current exchange rate for a new ticket “ no 
credit for the existing ticket, no discount, no standby. $1600 reserved for accommodations in New York “ gone if I 
wanted to leave Paris. Friends of friends came through to ensure that it didnt mean an extended stay in the airport 
lounge/recreating The Terminal. But what happens to the misguided traveler who doesnt have money for a new 
ticket on OpenSkies or another airline? From every conversation, they would be completely and totally stranded.
If Nothing Goes Wrong¦
Then you make it onto the flight. Theres nothing above and beyond the business class service youd find on a major 
airline, but it does deliver. Seats recline 140 degrees and have the expanded legroom thats typical of a business 
class service. Hot towels, socks that allow you to kick up your feet and rest them on the padded footrest, enough 
quality food to ensure that you dont leave hungry “ the amenities are all there, and in-flight service is an area where 
it doesnt seem any sacrifices have been made.
Flight attendants and cabin crew are pleasant and responsive, and though seats and the cabin interior show small 
signs of wear and tear, its nothing that takes away from the service. The difference of flying cramped in an economy 
seat compared to being able to stretch out, lean far back without bumping into someone else somehow makes the 
flight go by faster.
Recommended?
While the offer of a business class flight at a price close to economy is tempting, and the flight delivers, the lack of 
options available to passengers at the airport is something of a dealbreaker. You may be an experienced traveler 
who plans everything perfectly, but an unplanned problem can hit anyone and cause delays. Perhaps its the taxi or 
shuttle that doesnt arrive when scheduled, or an unexpected illness. Maybe its an accident on the way to the airport 
Open Skies Review: When Nobody Knows Your Airlines Name (How I Lost $1600 and Was Almost Stranded)
that holds traffic up. Or, it could be as simple as a first time passenger not finding the (obscured, poorly marked) 
check-in gate on time.
On the other hand, everything could go as planned, you could enjoy a business class flight thats generally 
comparable to that of major airlines. That chance of something going wrong may be small, but its there. The fact is 
that the cost saving staffing decisions can easily cost even the experienced traveler thousands of dollars “ or leave 
them stranded without recourse if anything goes awry and they dont have the money to pay for a last minute, 
international flight.
Perhaps its the price you pay for a reasonably priced airline ticket that doesnt make you feel like youre a level 
above being seated in the cargo hold, but its a high price to pay for trying to save.

(NASDAQ:RYAAY) ended the trading session higher by $0.34 or 1.11% from its previous close. Ryanair's price

Gbenga Kogbe “ UK Business Growth and Development “ Liligo.com 
Tell me about yourself/Whats your background?
I am business start-up and growth guy that migrated from the realm of multi-national energy companies to living in 
the world of small and medium sized companies and being as close to the action as possible. I am now responsible 
for establishing liligo.com as a travel brand in the UK.
Tell me about liligo.com?
Liligo is Europes most innovative real-time travel search engine. The company is based in Paris and is present (with 
local accents) all over Europe. Our unique proposition has won us many premier partners (including MSN, Via 
Michelin and Sony (NYSE:SNE)  Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERICY) ).
What has been your biggest challenge so far?
We have experienced quite staggering growth since we went live 4 years ago. Managing the Liligo brand in many 
different countries across Europe has been challenging for us all. 
How would you convince someone to give the liligo program a try?
The liligo affiliate program in the UK brings together all our experience gained from running programs around 
Europe. Our main strengths are high conversion rates (on average, over 50% of visits generate earnings for 
Gbenga Kogbe “ UK Business Growth and Development “ Liligo.com
affiliates) and predictable earnings with fixed commissions per click. We also pay out on clicks to low cost airlines 
such as easyjet and Ryanair “ no other affiliate programs in the UK do this!
Take a look at our campaign on            Commission Junction (program ID 2872021) to read more about our affiliate 
tools and generous commissions.
What   developments does liligo have planned?
We are planning exciting things in the mobile space and are already seeing some good results here. We have a 
leading travel iPhone app in Italy and Spain, for example, and also work with Sony Ericsson.
What are the main things affiliates do that you wish they wouldnt? 
Some affiliates would happily sacrifice long-term profitability in exchange for a quick buck. That is a real pity 
because such short-sightedness is unhelpful to us all, especially when ethics go out of the window.
What do you do that is green?
Liligo provides a real-time carbon calculator alongside flight prices, enabling users to gauge the different 
environmental footprints of their travel options.
What is on your iPod?
Or more appropriately, what do I listen to on Spotify? Everything¦ except heavy/trash metal.
Whats your favourite book?
I really love Herd by Mark Earls “ a fantastic book about our social nature.
What are your contact details (email, company, blog, facebook, myspace, forums etc)?

   Jul. 28, 2010 (Branding Strategy Insider delivered by Newstex) -- 
           
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair was in trouble again last week. Chief executive Michael OLeary was forced to 
apologise to easyJet founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, for depicting him in the January ad campaign above as a 
Pinocchio who misleads clients about punctuality.
To avoid a court case, Ryanair agreed to pay Sir Stelios costs and damages of £50,000 which will be donated to a 
charity of the easyJet founders choosing. Stelios joined in by claiming OLeary was the œugly face of capitalism.
The œugly face, however, was smiling broadly this week with the expected announcement that Ryanair would 
report first-quarter sales of £730m.
 
Despite angry volcanoes and even angrier competitors, Ryanair continues its transformation from a tiny brand that 
had only one plane to fly between Gatwick and Waterford in 1985 into Europes largest airline. More importantly, the 
brutal intelligence of Ryanairs marketing strategy has once again proved itself. It starts with advertising. A very 
special kind of advertising. Usually black and white. Consistently tacky in tone and execution. And always offensive. 
It could be a picture of a stripper dressed as a schoolgirl announcing œhot fares. It might be a hastily copied image 
of Churchill declaring that to œbeat terrorism after the 7/7 attacks consumers you should fly Ryanair. Or it might be 
a specific attack on a famous figure.
Stelios is merely the latest in a long line that includes Gordon Brown, the Pope and the president of France who 
have been aggressively parodied by the airline.
What follows is inevitably a public backlash or formal complaint. At this point, Ryanair kicks in with its PR campaign. 
OLeary himself usually goes onto the front foot and makes even more incendiary claims: Ryanair will make people 
Aggression: A Worthy Brand Builder
pay for toilets; there will be tickets for standing room only on flights; fat people will have to pay more; and everyone 
flying business class will get free sexual favours. All of it is nonsense, of course.
Few of the claims that Ryanair has made over the years are ever likely to come to pass. But thats not the point. A 
£25,000 ad campaign has suddenly become a million-pound piece of brand strategy. Because make no mistake, 
Ryanairs continued success is as much the result of building one of Europes most distinctive brands as it is low 
fares. The airline itself might publicly deny any such emphasis on branding - but the greatest trick the devil ever 
played was making you believe he didnt exist in the first place.
At the heart of the Ryanair business model is differentiation of the finest and most deliberate kind. I would - in all 
seriousness - rank Ryanair next to Hermès or Pret a Manger in terms of brand positioning and execution. Ryanairs 
brand associations centre on three key themes: low-price, no nonsense and aggression. Dont underestimate points 
two and three.
Ten years ago, there were a slew of discount airlines all competing on low prices, but all of them attempting to do 
so while they aped premium airlines. Only OLeary was savvy enough to build a brand that gloried in the low-cost 
model and made no excuses for the no-frills approach or the aggression with which it attacked established airlines. 
Or as he put it himself: œFor years, flying has been the preserve of rich fuckers. Now everyone can afford to fly.
Everything the airline has done since has centred on delivering a brand that consistently screams low price, 
aggression and no-frills - ad campaigns, the website, press conferences, and of course OLeary himself. I have a 
theory that Trinity-educated OLeary is actually quite an aesthete in his spare time. At weekends, he completes 
crosswords and enjoys the paintings of Velazquez. Only on Monday mornings does he look in the mirror, shout 
œBollocks! at himself and head out to deliver his very special brand of aggressive anarchy to the airline industry.
And what an asset he is. Think of all the identical old white duffers that run our brands so generically in the UK. 
Most would not even know what the concept of brand means, let alone their own organisations brand positioning. In 
contrast, OLeary is walking differentiation.
This is a leader who understands brand and its importance to the business and also the key role a CEO can play in 
reinforcing the positioning in the most basic but effective manner. Generic CEOs praise staff as the heart of their 
business. OLearys response: œMBA students come out with, My staff are my most important asset. Bullshit. Staff 
are usually your biggest cost.
Its time to recognise Ryanair. But lets give the airline credit for what it is, as well as what is pretends to be. Yes, its 
a superbly aggressive low-cost airline. But its also one of Europes best run brands. And while were at it - lets 
reassess Michael OLearys status too. Rather than a scourge of CEOs, he is their living prototype.

 New York, July 27th (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (OOTC:RYAOF)  (NASDAQ:RYAAY) 
closed the trading day higher by $0.14 or 0.46% from its previous close. Ryanair's shares price action formed what 
is considered to be a doji close, where the open and close prices are very close to each other, mainly signaling an 
indecision between buyers and sellers.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's current stock range is defined by a trough, which marks calculated support at $26.63 and by a peak that 
marked the resistance point at $30.29. These levels are closely watched by traders managing their positions.
Traders wanting to establish a position in Ryanair or traders that are already holding the stock can use the doji 
close to their advantage, since the pattern present a short term pause in the stock's price action. This pause results 
in an entry point for traders depending of which way the stock resolves this short term indecision.
Doji are important candlesticks that provide information on their own and as components in a number of important 
patterns. Doji form when a security's open and close are virtually equal. The length of the upper and lower shadows 
can vary and the resulting candlestick looks like a cross, inverted cross or plus sign. Alone, doji are neutral patterns.
Any bullish or bearish bias is based on preceding price action and future confirmation. In the case of Ryanair, given 
that the stock finished the session higher, bulls should monitor their positions for confirmation that stock will 
continue higher by taking today's intraday high. Below a Doji illustration:

   Jul. 26, 2010 (The Economist delivered by Newstex) -- 
    Gulliver       Michael O'Leary       A.B. | LONDON       Michael O'Leary is unbothered by Ryanair's apology    
AN entertaining interview in yesterdays            Sunday Times with the boss of Ryanair, Michael OLeary, highlighted 
the differences between his public persona and his private demeanour.
O'Leary is 49 years old and has built a robust business”70m passengers, £2.5 billion revenues”that now bestrides 
Europe. He should be feted and respected by all. But hes not, because he is rude, irascible and determinedly 
unclubbable.
"I don't want to be loved," he says simply. Mission accomplished then.
Its all a bit odd, because to meet he is a charmer”warm, very sharp, but funny, too.
Doubtless the same could be said of many a corporate bigwig who understands that nice guys, or at least publicly 
nice guys, don't usually come first. What's interesting about Mr O'Leary, though, is the way he has made a virtue of 
his pantomime-villain status. He doesn't seem to give a hoot if you loathe him, if the result is greater familiarity with 
his airline's fares.
In the week after Ryanair was forced to apologise to the founder of easyJet, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, over 
advertising that depicted him as a liar, Mr O'Leary seemed in good form. But then he readily admits that for Ryanair, 
there really is no such thing as bad press.
We generate publicity with the original ads, and more publicity when he drags my fifth humiliating apology of the 
week out of me.
And since this all apparently serves to drive more people to Ryanair's website (who, I wonder, are these new 
flyers?), that spells happiness for Mr O'Leary.

If youre outside of Europe, you likely havent been paying close attention to the            awesome drama unfolding 
over easyJet.  The airlines operations appear to be falling apart and the founder is threatening to take the name 
away if it doesnt improve.  This is worthy of a TV special.
easyJet was started in 1995 by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou.  He slapped his famed œeasy brand with bright orange 
colors on the airline and it took off from there.  The initial idea behind easyJet was to be like a Southwest Airlines 
(NYSE:LUV)  “ low cost, low fare flying all around Europe but initially from its Britain base.  Ive always thought of 
easyJet as being Ryanairs more convenient cousin.  For example, easyJet flies most to primary airports while 
Ryanair focuses on alternates.  easyJet also hasnt gone to the extremes of cost cutting in terms of passenger 
amenities, but theres a problem.
EasyJets on-time performance sucks, and for that reason, Ryanair is infinitely more convenient.  You can follow 
FlightStats to see            how dreadful easyJets performance has been on a daily basis, but the furor really came 
out of a report showing that the            airline didnt even get half of its flights out of Gatwick in the air on time in 
June.  Its not good.
Lots of excuses are coming out of the easyJet headquarters, but nobody really cares.  Management has blamed air 
traffic control strikes, but other airlines dont seem to be performing as poorly as easyJet.  This is where it gets 
interesting.
Sir Stelios may be intricately tied with easyJet, but hes pissed.  Back in May, he left the board because hes angry 
about the airlines expansion plans, which he thinks wont add value for shareholders.  His family still owns 38 
percent of the airline, but he stepped down from the board so he could act solely as a large shareholder to prevent 
management from going forward with these plans.
Awesome Drama Over easyJets Unreliable Operation
The on-time debacle has just added flames to the fire.  When Ryanair chief            Michael OLeary came out 
swinging against easyJet and Sir Stelios for having a terrible on time record and failing to publish it, Sir Stelios got 
angry.  He made it clear that he had nothing to do with it, and that led to one of the strangest things ever.  In fact, Im 
surprised it didnt cause a rip in the space-time continuum.
OLeary apologized.  In print.  No, he didnt apologize to easyJet but rather to Sir Stelios for implicating him in the 
airlines failures.  Sir Stelios has taken that apology and started a crusade of his own against easyJet.  He is now 
threatening the airline by saying that if            on-time performance doesnt improve within 90 days, hes pulling the 
brand license.  Yeehaw, this is getting good.
Sir Stelios had already been angry about the use of the brand, and this just adds flames to the fire.  See, brand 
license requires that the airline            generate at least 75% of its revenues from the core business of flying.  This 
is meant to protect other easy-branded companies that have their own spheres.  The airline, however, is arguing 
that the way that number is calculated is bull.  So the two have been going at it in court.
In the end, this is just a disaster.  How can an airline focus on running a business when its embroiled in a massive 
fight with its founder and 38% shareholder?  It really cant.  I dont blame Sir Stelios.  Hes acting in his best interests, 
as he should.  This whole thing is just a mess, and ultimately passengers will be screwed.

           If youre any kind of frequent traveler, youre probably well aware of how prices in air travel have changed 
over the past few years. With airlines charging for checked bags, many people are beginning to pack multiple carry-
ons in order to avoid these charges. But Spirit Airlines recently upped the ante by charging $20 for each bag that is 
put in the overhead compartment. Spirit is widely known for their cheap fares, making the new fees a point of 
conjecture for many Spirit customers.
Ben Baldanza, CEO of Spirit Airlines, recently appeared in front of the House Subcommittee on Aviation to discuss 
the implications behind the Government Accountability Offices (GAO) plea for airlines to disclose more information 
regarding hidden fees associated with purchasing an airlines ticket. The GAO feels that too many airlines do not 
make it clear as to where a customers money is going when they purchase a ticket.
Baldanza was present to explain Spirits idea of œunbundling service charges, citing that an airfare should only 
apply to the cost of transporting a passenger. So while you pay less money for an airfare, any additional services 
(i.e. overhead/checked baggage, food, etc) that you desire must be paid for separately. The point is to help 
customers become more aware of what theyre paying for and to decide for themselves whether or not they need a 
service. {Budget Travel} Spirits service is similar to that of Europes RyanAir, a company heralded for its $12 fares. 
But customers understand that anything extra besides transport must be paid for.
Baldanza supports his companys approach to charges by citing that Southwest, one of the only airlines to have 
actually turned a profit over recent years while still maintaining low fares, applies hidden charges for checked bags 
whether or not a customer decides to utilize the service. Mr. Baldanza seems to imply that hidden costs are simply 
a dishonest way of conducting business. {           Reuters}
In the Spirit of Taxation
As part of the price transparency called for by the GAO, taxes on hidden charges may be extended as well. 
Baldanza supported the idea by saying that low-fare airlines, like Spirit, pay a greater tax percentage per ticket than 
other carriers because they are only charging customers for the essential transportation of the passenger. Other 
carriers with non-taxed surplus charges built into the ticket price have a monetary buffer with each ticket purchase, 
meaning that their tickets are not being taxed at the same percentage as the low-fare carriers. Of course, taxes on 
surplus charges  would still apply to Spirit and their optional services, but at least things would be fair. {           
Smarter Travel}
Which business model do you think is better? Should extra services liked checked baggage fees, in-flight meals, 
and the sort be taxed to produce budgets for the FAA?

    Gulliver       Internet charges in hotels       T.W. | TEGUCIGALPA       Why do expensive hotels charge most for 
Wi-Fi?    
LIMP toast and tepid milk: yours for just $15. Most hotel breakfasts are such awful deals that the only people who 
would consider them are those who are a) horribly busy and b) spending someone elses money. Business 
travellers, in other words. The evidence is there every morning in the dining-rooms of posh hotels: apart from a few 
holidaymakers too dazed to have worked out the currency-conversion rate, almost everyone else is in a suit, 
charging the bill to their expense account.
After a few recent trips, Ive noticed a new ruse that may be squeezing even more out of the wallets of the AmEx-
wielding business set: internet access. Like a speedy breakfast, its something that most holidaymakers can live 
without, but business travellers really need”and it is priced accordingly. At the moment Im in Honduras, one of the 
cheapest countries in the Americas. Yet at the Tegucigalpa Intercontinental, one day of Wi-Fi costs nearly $17 (or 
roughly three-and-a-half days pay for the average Honduran). Whats more, its $17 per computer, which in the age 
of internet-ready iPhones is a pain.
When it comes to hidden charges, the rule seems to be that the higher the up-front cost of the room, the more the 
guests can expect to pay for extras. Most of the cheap hotels Ive stayed in recently have had free Wi-Fi”heck, you 
even get it free in McDonalds these days. B&Bs usually also charge less for things like phone calls and laundry, 
favourite money-spinners for the smart hotels. And they are more generous with extras such as bottled water in the 
rooms. (The litre-bottles here at the Intercontinental cost $4.)
Is it so surprising that expensive hotels come with expensive extras? Maybe not, until you consider other travel 
industries, such as airlines. Go with a pricey carrier and you tend to get a meal thrown in, allocated seating, and so 
on. Budget airlines, meanwhile, sell tickets for peanuts but whack you later with eye-watering luggage charges and 
expensive nibbles on board. In the hotel world, it seems like the smarter chains somehow get away with a double-
whammy: British Airways prices for the room, and Ryanair prices for the extras.

 Well the Twitterverse is agog with rumours that the Old Bill will be feeling some collars in the legal IT world next 
week. We'll just have to wait and see on that one. And we also like the reports that RyanAir is about to move into 
the legal sector with the launch of a cut-price City law firm. Apparently it will be called Ryan O'Law and fee earners 
will have to provide their own IT and will be docked one unit of billable time whenever they go to the loo or have a 
cup of coffee (they will also have to bring their own coffee). We've also heard some new recruits were disappointed 
to find that the "City of London" offices are actually located on Canvey Island.
Finally, here's a little bit of futurology, courtesy of one of our Canadian readers who found it on a Korean website. 
There are some neat ideas here though we're not sure that giant fish tanks are on everyone's IT must have list.

 Deal-hunting used to be relatively simple. You'd fire up your computer, hit a few aggregators and online travel 
agencies, maybe a few airlinesites. Then, you'd pick your ticket and pull the trigger. The lowest number wins, right?
Wrong ... at least according to Congess.
Down in            Washington, the folks who'd rather not be distracted by continued high unemployment or wars in 
two countries dispatched investigators to dig into the wave of new fees introduced over the past few years make it 
hard to figure out where the best deal is. Your cheap ride seems great, of course, until you want to grab a pillow 
and check a bag ...            or not check a bag, depending on the airline.
According to            USA Today:
Since 2007, many airlines have been charging for services that were traditionally included in the price of a ticket. 
That's improved airline bottom lines in a tough economy but raised the ire of travelers who find themselves nickeled 
and dimed to substantially higher costs.
The mathematical gymnastics involved - e.g., adding a bag-checking fee to the ticket price - are more common in 
Europe, where            easyJet and            Ryanair have forced passengers to do addition for years.
While Congressional investigators don't think passengers can do the math for themselves, it's clear that the airlines 
have figured it out: 10 U.S. airlines raked in $7.8 billion in ancillary fees last year. Delta (NYSE:DAL)  led the pack 
with $1.6 billion.

    Gulliver       Budget airlines       A.B. | LONDON       Ryanair forced to apologise to the founder of easyJet    
RYANAIR has            apologised "unreservedly" to Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder of easyJet, over advertising 
depicting him as a liar. Ryanair suggested that Sir Stelios had failed to tell the truth about easyJet's punctuality. The 
libel suit was settled out of court, with Ryanair paying Sir Stelios's costs and £50,100 (to be donated to charity), and 
taking out adverts in the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian, the newspapers in which the offending adverts had 
been placed.
This is not the first time Ryanair's boss, Michael O'Leary has tasted humble pie, and the Guardian helpfully lists his 
top six apologies. It also shares the (slightly unfunny)            cartoon Sir Stelios put together to celebrate his victory. 
I think I would have preferred a dignified silence. Although given that Mr OLeary had earlier suggested settling the 
claim with a race around Trafalgar Square or a sumo wrestling match, perhaps the time for dignity had already 
passed.

Using sexy flight attendants to advertise an airline is nothing new, but the Flight Attendants Association of Australia 
says it has had enough of them. According to the FAAA, the ads are demeaning, and increase the risk of sexual 
harassment. One of the clips that triggered their outrage can be seen above. 
The clip, made for Russian low cost airline AviaNova, shows the flight crew stripping down and sponging off the 
airplane. A spokeswoman for the FAAA said:
"It is a sad reflection of the attitude of the airlines' executives, dare I say more than likely middle aged males, 
towards cabin crew, in particular female cabin crew, by portraying them in such a demeaning, distasteful and 
irrelevant manner."
Now, I'm partly in agreement with her, but to paint airline executives as a bunch of middle aged males shows an 
equal amount of disrespect, as many of these ads come from the airline PR firm, and I highly doubt the airline 
executives specifically asked for something with some skin - PR and marketing people don't need help from airline 
executives to know that sex and partial nudity sells. 
The FAAA is going to take the issue to the International Transport Federation, but I suspect that they have more 
important issues to deal with than asking airlines to stop promoting themselves in the most effective way possible. 
The Russian carrier is by no means the first to resort to this tactic, using looks and fashion to sell airplane tickets 
dates back to the 60's and 70's when airlines would pick attractive flight attendants for their planes, and feature 
them in commercials. In recent years, carriers like Ryanair and VivaAerobus have even commissioned calendars 
showing off their cabin crew.

New York, July 8th (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (OOTC:RYAOF)  (NASDAQ:RYAAY) 
closed the trading session at $29.26 just above calculated resistance at $28.57 moving to what appears to be a 
new range, as this move will clearly raise the attention of momentum buyers.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's stock was trading in a well defined range with support at $26.63 and resistance at $28.57, given that this 
range was broken traders will be closely monitoring the stock?s price action for clues of direction.
From a technical perspective it can be expected that previous resistance becomes support, as the new range gets 
defined, however, given that Ryanair's stock is still near the broken resistance level, traders will be focusing on 
$28.57 to see if the stock holds the breakout without rolling over.

 Last year, Ryanair first mentioned their concept for several rows of standing only seats. The idea back then was to 
install special standing seats and offer them for a reduced fee. 
The new seating innovation has not been implemented yet, but Michael O'Leary wants everyone to know that he is 
still very serious about it, and hopes to pay for the new seats with proceeds from the paid bathrooms he also hopes 
to install soon. 
If there is one thing I've learned about Ryanair, it is that even though most of their ideas sound like crackpot ways to 
generate some free PR, they take their silly ideas quite seriously. 
Ryanair knows that there is virtually no limit to the inconveniences passengers will put up with in exchange for crazy 
low airfares. When your flight is just a few hours out of a one week vacation, the savings on airfare leave you with 
more money for food, booze and tacky souvenirs.
With the new seats, between 40 and 50 extra passengers can be loaded on the planes, pushing things to the 
absolute maximum the plane is approved to carry. Still, the big question is whether you'd be willing to pay an 
insanely low fare in exchange for a standing seat on a flight of several hours.

Discount European airline Ryanair is taking discount further than you ever thought possible, reports            Daily 
Mail. Starting next year, passengers can buy £4 standing tickets and pay £1 to use the lavatory.
The trick is getting it past safety regulators:
The plan is to remove the back ten rows of seats from the carrier's 250 planes and replace them with 15 rows of 
vertical seats. Two toilets at the back could also be removed to free up even more space.
In the vertical seats, passengers will still be restrained with a seat belt which will go over the shoulder, and will 
adhere to all current safety regulations which apply to normal aircraft seating, Ryanair said.
Discount flights outside the US can be ridiculously packed, and fast, and cheap. Although the idea of standing 
flights is shocking, it makes economic sense and people will buy. Even Americans have swallowed the idea of 
paying for baggage.
Why are airlines cutting costs? Fuel costs are only going up.

Shares 
of 
Ryanair 
Holdings 
PLC 
(OOTC:RYAOF)  
(NASDAQ:RYAAY) closed the trading day lower by $0.52 or -1.89% from its previous close. Ryanair's shares price 
action formed what is considered to be a doji close, where the open and close prices are very close to each other, 
mainly signaling an indecision between buyers and sellers.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's current stock range is defined by a trough, which marks calculated support at $26.63 and by a peak that 
marked the resistance point at $28.57. These levels are closely watched by traders managing their positions.
Traders wanting to establish a position in Ryanair or traders that are already holding the stock can use the doji 
close to their advantage, since the pattern present a short term pause in the stock's price action. This pause results 
in an entry point for traders depending of which way the stock resolves this short term indecision.
Doji are important candlesticks that provide information on their own and as components in a number of important 
patterns. Doji form when a security's open and close are virtually equal. The length of the upper and lower shadows 
can vary and the resulting candlestick looks like a cross, inverted cross or plus sign. Alone, doji are neutral patterns.
Any bullish or bearish bias is based on preceding price action and future confirmation. In the case of Ryanair, given 
that the stock finished the session lower, bears should monitor the stock, as it could reverse if it manages to trade 
above today's intraday high. Below a Doji illustration:

            By Daniel Carr
Cell phone rage could soon be coming to a flight near you:            Three Chinese airlines have signed deals to allow 
in flight cell phone usage. Air China, China South and China East are beginning preparations to allow passengers 
to use their cells mid flight in order to offer services offered by competing airlines throughout Europe, Africa and 
America. The set price per minute: 15 yuan!
Yes, listening to fellow passengers nattering down the phone as you recline at 30,000 feet could soon accompany 
the bad food and DVT. There has always been a general consensus among experts that the use of cellular 
telephones on board planes would ˜fly the way to disaster since the radio waves emitted by cell phones can 
interfere with the pilots two-way radio system, as well as affect the on board navigation systems.
Expert opinions, however, have been put in to disrepute after several airlines throughout the world have begun to 
trial, and indeed implement on board telephony capability. Lufthansa pushed the boundaries by allowing text 
messaging and emailing via an internet connection. Emirates then went one step further and caused controversy in 
March 2008 when they offered a full in-flight cell phone service, charging passengers the equivalent of 20 Yuan a 
minute for voice calls.
For a cell phone to be used for voice calls on board a plane, a ˜picocell - a tiny mobile phone mast - has to be 
installed. More airlines; including Ryanair and British Airways, have begun to follow in the path of Emirates and 
install these tiny antenna.
Although Air China, China South and China East            may not have the capability to offer this service to Expo 
visitors as they fly off to faraway lands, it may not be in the too distant future that we can take off from Pudong, 
whilst reminding our ayi to water the plants!
China looks forward to cellphone rage at 30,000 feet!

Once again, Irish low cost carrier Ryanair is in the news with a story involving passenger mistreatment. Yesterday, 
police were called to assist in calming 168 passengers on a Ryanair plane at Prestwick airport in the UK. The plane 
was bound for Girona, Spain, but had been stuck on the ground for six hours. 
With a wait of that length, the passengers were naturally becoming quite annoyed, but to make matters worse, the 
flight crew were not willing/able to serve any food or drinks. Because of EU tax laws, the bar carts on the plane are 
sealed until the plane is airborne, which meant passengers would have to sit the wait out without anything to drink. 
Since Ryanair is a pay-for-everything airline, passengers are not allowed to bring their own food or drinks on board, 
and at the six hour mark, this proved to be too much, and some passengers began to riot. When local police 
arrived, they didn't arrest anyone, and did the right thing - they went into the airport and purchased water and 
chocolate for the agitated passengers. 
Ryanair apologized for the incident, blaming striking French air traffic controllers for the delay. Still, it may be a good 
idea to stock an unsealed bar tray on their planes, because keeping passengers locked on board a plane for six 
hours without anything to eat or drink takes customer service to new lows. Then again, Ryanair does seem to excel 
in finding those lows whenever they can.

    Gulliver       Hand luggage in Latin America       T.W. | MEXICO CITY       A relaxed approach to hand luggage in 
Latin America    
WHOS that idiot with the titanic carry-on bag that ought to have gone in the hold? Shamefully, its sometimes me. 
The joy of skipping off the plane and out of the airport, without having to wait for the luggage conveyor-belt to crank 
into action, is so great that its tempting to cram everything into a carry-on bag (or two) until it creeps over the 10kg 
limit.
Here in Latin America such naughtiness is indulged. Equipaje de mano is normally not weighed at all and, when it 
is, the check-in police can be appeased by the transfer of a few items from one carry-on bag to another. Having 
sometimes thought my own hand luggage was a bit big, Ive been encouraged to see fellow passengers hulking 
suitcases that would be better suited to a shipping container.
Its a great contrast with Europe, where going over the weight limit reliably elicits tuts and fines. Last year Ryanair 
was attacked for applying a £30 ($45) penalty to anyone who couldnt fit their duty-free shopping into their single 
piece of hand-luggage. The same airline charges extra for check-in baggage, of any weight: £45 for the first bag 
and £70 for the second, if you pay at the airport. Overweight baggage is charged at an additional £20 per kilo.
Latin American airlines can afford to be so generous because they charge such whopping amounts for the ticket in 
the first place. My glee at avoiding a penalty of a few pesos is mad considering that I may already have forked out 
$500 for a two-hour flight. Ryanair and cos fees are hideous, but at least the flights themselves can be bought for 
pocket money.
And not everywhere in the Americas is relaxed. On a recent internal flight in Costa Rica, in a plane so tiny I 
wondered if someone was flying it by remote control, the check-in staff weighed not only the suitcases but their 
holders. Fortunately for The Economist, bulging luggage was offset by skinny correspondent.

 I am covering my last individual short position Hartford Financial Services (NYSE:HIG)  (HIG) for a 4% gain.  I've 
replaced it with a small short of the indexes via TNA (less than 2%) but I want to be shorting either right below 1100 
or below 1070.  In between those ares is a vast area of 30 S&P points that means little to me.  I will look for new 
individual names to short if we can get any sort of bounce here - net, net of all the individual names I shorted (about 
8) I probably only came out with a small gain due to the Monday morning mess, so a lot of work for nothing. :)  
Theoretically other than Discover Financial and Ryanair they all would have worked in time - but theory is only good 
for academic papers.
At this point I'd actually like to see a bounce into S&P 1100 to remount the short side of the book.  Or a move below 
1070 which would give me more confidence we are headed to the 1040s in time.
Short TNA in fund; no personal position

 New 
York, June 22nd (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (OOTC:RYAOF)  
(NASDAQ:RYAAY) closed the trading day lower by $0.43 or -1.57% from its previous close. Ryanair's shares price 
action formed what is considered to be a doji close, where the open and close prices are very close to each other, 
mainly signaling an indecision between buyers and sellers.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's current stock range is defined by a trough, which marks calculated support at $21.55 and by a peak that 
marked the resistance point at $28.57. These levels are closely watched by traders managing their positions.
Traders wanting to establish a position in Ryanair or traders that are already holding the stock can use the doji 
close to their advantage, since the pattern present a short term pause in the stock's price action. This pause results 
in an entry point for traders depending of which way the stock resolves this short term indecision.
Doji are important candlesticks that provide information on their own and as components in a number of important 
patterns. Doji form when a security's open and close are virtually equal. The length of the upper and lower shadows 
can vary and the resulting candlestick looks like a cross, inverted cross or plus sign. Alone, doji are neutral patterns.
Any bullish or bearish bias is based on preceding price action and future confirmation. In the case of Ryanair, given 
that the stock finished the session lower, bears should monitor the stock, as it could reverse if it manages to trade 
above today's intraday high. Below a Doji illustration:

New York, June 18th (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (OOTC:RYAOF)  (NASDAQ:RYAAY) 
closed the trading session at $28.40 just above calculated resistance at $28.25 moving to what appears to be a 
new range, as this move will clearly raise the attention of momentum buyers.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's stock was trading in a well defined range with support at $21.55 and resistance at $28.25, given that this 
range was broken traders will be closely monitoring the stock?s price action for clues of direction.
From a technical perspective it can be expected that previous resistance becomes support, as the new range gets 
defined, however, given that Ryanair's stock is still near the broken resistance level, traders will be focusing on 
$28.25 to see if the stock holds the breakout without rolling over.

Looking back, it seems very strange that in the early 1980s the genteel town of
Eastbourne witnessed marches of hundreds of people chanting ˜Maggie, Maggie, Maggie....Out, Out, Out.
Of course, by the standards of the time, these political activities were relatively innocuous. But the subsequent year-
long miners strike, which began in 1984, brought a new viciousness to industrial disputes. The violence in many 
Nottinghamshire pit villages, along with the quasi mediaeval riots at Orgreave, will be long remembered.
With large public sector job losses now almost certain, union militancy is likely to reappear this winter - with a 
vengeance.
Public sector unions are already anticipating industrial action, with local government, education and the NHS being 
obvious target areas. Aside from large job losses, wage cuts and less favourable pension scheme terms will be at 
the heart of many disputes. Union discontent is not limited to the public sector. The futile dispute at British Airways 
continues “ to the undoubted benefit of other carriers, such as Ryanair and EasyJet.
The Communication Workers Union (CWU) will shortly be holding a ballot amongst its 50,000 staff at British 
Telecom. The Royal Mail, too, may well face action from the CWU. Given the unions fractious relationship with 
Network Rail, strikes are also expected on the railways during the coming holiday months. At least, a widespread 
miners strike will be avoided. There are now only a handful of underground pits operational in the UK compared 
with more than a 1,000 in the early 1920s, when close to one million miners were employed.
As the sun sets on the summer of 2010, the likelihood is that the following few months will be very challenging. The 
Coalition Government will come face to face with a wide range of malcontents.
A winter of malcontents?
How tough will it need to be to ensure that its policies prevail?

œWe are like dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants, Bernard of Chartres.
œGood artists borrow, great artists steal,            Picasso, or, more likely,            TS Eliot.
Youre œstepping all over Apples IP,            Steve Jobs.
Lets get one thing straight. There arent any truly original ideas out there. Even the most astonishing scientific 
breakthroughs are built on the foundations of others work. Innovation, even great innovation, is frequently 
recombination of existing piece parts along with a twist or two, perhaps a different business model, core market, 
geographic focus.
Most of the literature on the subject, though, treats innovation as a sacred search for the truly different and unique, 
and diminishes the role of imitation. As such, it does a disservice to business “ an audience that fails to appreciate 
the critical importance of not reinventing the wheel. [You could argue that reviewers and bloggers have enabled this 
innovation-worship, including this one.]
Oded Shenkars new book, œ           Copycats: How Smart Companies Use Imitation to Gain a Strategic Edge, goes 
in the other direction. Shenkar celebrates corporate imitation. At the outset, he describes the biological conditions 
that favor imitation as a survival mechanism in all species. Then he points out that most innovative products spawn 
several followers who become long-term successes (often at the expense of the first mover). Southwest has been 
spectacularly successful, but so have EasyJet and Ryanair. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT)  borrowed many concepts from 
œCopycats “ a fresh look at how imitation contributes to innovation
Sol Prices long-gone FedMart (           Price, an amazing retail innovator, went on to found another innovative 
concept, the Price Club shopping warehouse, only to be swallowed up by imitator Costco (NASDAQ:COST)  in 
1993).
Through his case studies and skewering of the innovation-worshiping business culture, Shenkar seems to be 
advocating against doing anything new. But as the book goes on, his overarching theme becomes clearer. Sheer 
imitation can only get you so far. Imitation combined with tightly-focused innovation (a combination Shenkar calls 
œimovation) is the best strategy possible. In other words, take the best of what others have done“dont be the first 
into a new market, or be the first widget out there“but nonetheless add some distinctive capability.
What Shenkar advocates is more nuanced than the summary just presented. But as I read œCopycats, and got 
more convinced of his point, I was unconvinced that this approach needs a new name. To my eyes, innovation (at 
least successful innovation) does involve this intense borrowing of existing concepts and adding something unique 
and valuable, whether it be integration, business model, user experience, or (           as Roberto Verganti would 
assert) the meaning users attribute to the product.
But this is quibbling. œCopycats goes against the grain of the current innovation literature, much to its credit. It 
deserves to be read by anyone trying to innovate or imitate “ and perhaps those should be the same people.

    Gulliver       Carry-on luggage       A.B. | LONDON       Another reminder about what you can put in your hand 
luggage    
THREE cathartic points to make after a Ryanair flight from Marseille to London on Wednesday:
1) Soft cheese counts as a liquid and you can't therefore take more than 100g in your hand luggage. Having 
forgotten this loosely applied rule I was hauled up by security staff who had spotted the sheeps cheese in my 
daypack. I duly stuffed as much into my mouth as possible, with Mrs Gulliver valiantly joining in, before binning the 
rest and wandering queasily into the duty-free area. Our hard cheese came on board with us. Lesson learnt.
2) I tried to make amends by whingeing knowledgeably as we passed through five different queues to board the 
plane. That's clearly too many, but it's not queuing per se that bothers me. (If you don't want queues, don't fly with a 
low-cost airline.) It's unfair queuing. Perhaps this is a peculiarly British complaint. Perhaps it sounds over petty. But 
people who arrive last for the ticket check in the departure lounge should not get on the plane earlier than others 
because of an absence of organisation. It's not a big deal, but enough for some eye-rolling and muttering.
3) We were due to depart at 3pm (French time) and arrive at 4.05pm (UK time). Despite leaving half an hour late, 
we touched down in England at 4.10pm, which says something about the error margin Ryanair builds into its 
schedules. But though the flight was late and passengers had stood for a long time in a hot room before they could 
board, we were still treated on landing to the self-congratulatory fanfare and announcement that Ryanair unleashes 
when it reckons it has performed up to scratch: œYou have arrived on yet another on time Ryanair flight. 
Passengers groaned in disbelief. They know when theyve had a good flight and when not; dont try telling them 
otherwise.

short haul and high frequency have defined support at $11.59 and resistance at $12.77. Also among the worst 
performers was Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY), which closed the trading session at $26.94 representing 0.3% from the 
previous trading session.
Benchmark crude for July delivery was lower closing the trading session at $74.21 a barrel on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange lower by $-1.27 from the previous trading session. Crude prices are closely watched by 
traders as they usually correlate with the airline stocks, given that a big component of the airlines' cost structure is 
covered by the price of fuel.

   Jun. 10, 2010 (Fund My Mutal Fund delivered by Newstex) -- 
 All my shorts at this moment will be purely technical, nothing to do with fundamentals but if you insist this is a 
discount airline in Europe.  The setup is very defined, I am shorting here at $26.90 with about a 2.2% allocation.  I 
am going to give it 50 cents or 1.8% for a stop loss, which will be $27.40.
I put out 3-4 other names but with limit purchases (shorts) that require them to jump another 3-6% to trigger, so let 
us see if the S&P 500 puts another +3% day up which would be the 3rd in about 10 sessions ... which is funny 
considering the downtrend we have been in.   I am purposefully avoiding material or energy names because they 
are so news driven and the computers change their opinions on a 24 hour news cycle.
I am reminded of the Karate Kid by this market: wax on, wax off ... risk on, risk off.

Hello airline fans and fanatics.
This week's issue of PlaneBusiness Banter is now posted. Subscribers can access the latest issue here.
This week we have a real mixed bag of goodies to go through. First, we had the first "suspended" agreement 
between a union and an airline that I have ever heard of. Then, north of the border we had an airline IPO yanked at 
the last minute. Porter Airlines says it was because of "volatile market conditions." I suspect those weak first quarter 
numbers from the airline didn't help much either.
We talk a lot this week about the DOT's latest attempts to make the airline industry more consumer-friendly. 
Needless to say I think this whole exercise by the DOT is overly political and, for the most part, unnecessary.
And if the DOT thinks that the rules they have suggested are going to improve "customer service" in the industry, 
well, that just isn't going to happen.
What really ticks me off though is the fact that, overall, the airline industry in the U.S. is turning in some of the best 
operational performances it has seen in a very long time.
Apparently no one at the DOT is aware of this. Or care that this is the case. Oh no, it's more important to pay 
passengers if their bags arrive late.

In other news, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court ruling in the USAPA/Former America West 
pilot lawsuit last week. I was surprised. Word is that the former America West pilots are going to ask that the entire 
11 member court re-hear the case. A three-person panel issued the ruling last week.
Not sure if you have been keeping up with what is going on with UPS, but the company just furloughed the first 50 
or so of what it says will be as many as 300 pilots.
Yes, this was the first furlough in the history of the cargo carrier.
Meanwhile. over at American Airlines, the TWU said late last week that it has "suspended" its latest tentative 
agreement with the airline. This was the agreement with the fleet service workers and the baggage handlers that 
the TWU negotiating committee had already advised members not to vote for. It'll be interesting to hear what the 
back story is on this one. There are all kinds of stories floating around.
We talk about the latest DOT Airline Travel Consumer Report this week as well. Another great overall month for 
Alaska Airlines and another less-than-optimal month for American Airlines.
Airline stocks had a slow week. The top gainer for the week were ADRs of Ryanair -- which was a result of that 
airline's better than expected earnings numbers it released last week.
Lots of letters this week -- most of which talked about my column last week concerning American Airlines 
(NYSE:AMR)  and its merger prospects. I may post that column on a delayed basis for everyone to read. I'll post a 
link here if I do.
A little of that, a little of this. And more. In this week's issue of PlaneBusiness Banter.

Irish Minister's fury over Ryanair $120 baggage fee

   Jun. 2, 2010 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Ryanair has yet again managed to make the news with their outrageous fees - though this time, they may have 
annoyed the wrong person. 
For the busy summer season, Ryanair passengers will have to pay £5 more for their checked luggage - making the 
first checked bag £20 ($29) , and second bag £40 ($58). The real kicker comes when you are unable to check in 
online - which will double the checked bag fee to £40 for the first bag and £80 for the second. 
With these numbers, a family of two (each with two bags) that finds themselves unable to do an online check in 
could be paying as much as $350 for the right to travel with their bags. And when you consider that seats on 
Ryanair sell for as little as $5, you'll see why a bargain airline isn't always the cheapest option.
Irish Finance Minister Sammy Wilson is so outraged, that he is urging passengers to take their business elsewhere. 
Mr. Wilson says Ryanair is treating passengers with "arrogance and disdain".
Of course, the big winner in this new fee scheme is Ryanair- just this week, they announced a healthy profit from 
the past year, making them one of just a handful of profitable airlines in the world. So - if you plan to travel on 
Ryanair this summer season, be sure to verify that you can do online check in, and that you pack your stuff in one 
bag, otherwise you may burn through all your vacation cash in just a few flights.

   Jun. 1, 2010 (EU Referendum delivered by Newstex) -- 
           
With            easyJet considering taking on the government over the volcanic ash debacle, we now have            
Michael O'Leary (pictured), the head of Ryanair, getting in on the act.
This is good to see as, when I first raised questions about this, I was rather out on a limb. The bulk of the comments 
were distinctly hostile to my thesis and there was only limited support for my view that the closure of the airspace 
was an over-reaction.
Anyhow, from a safe distance after the event, O'Leary has now rounded on the Met Office's Volcanic Ash Advisory 
Centre for its handling of "aviation's biggest crisis since the war", launching a "vitriolic attack" on their forecasters. 
Met Office charts, he says, "suggested the that the big black plume of volcanic ash had spread from Iceland all over 
the southern Atlantic, much of continental Europe and half way across Russia as well as over a large part of the 
arctic circle."
"The fact is the sun wasn't blocked out in any of these areas and none of us could see a bl**dy thing didn't seem to 
worry the Met Office, where we suspect the only place that there was volcanic ash was in the basement of the Met 
Office or in between the ears of the people who produced these charts," he said.
"I don't mind paying passenger right to care when it is our fault. But if it is not our fault and some stupid regulator or 
government has closed down airspace, because some idiot in a basement in the Met Office in London spills coffee 
over the map of Europe and produces a big black cloud, we shouldn't be paying for your right to care," O'Leary 
continued.
"They made a complete dog's balls of it yet passed this cost onto the airlines. We paid compensation for their 
mismanagement for and incompetence," he then concludes.
Ryanair joins in
O'Leary, though, has got it wrong -- as he did with the Irish referendum. As we pointed out            earlier, it was not 
the Met Office, per se that was wrong, but the regulators relying on the Met Office models, without insisting on 
independent, physical verification of data -- using direct measurement from airborne sampling.
Picking on the Met Office alone is bound to be highly entertaining, but it isn't going to win a court case. For that, the 
actual decision-makers need to be identified, which is not going to be that easy, given the way responsibility has 
been diffused.
Also, the airlines are not going to be able to walk away from their own responsibilities. They had plenty of 
opportunities to comment on the IACO contingency plan and one wonders how many -- Ryanair included -- 
complained about the inadequacies and the lack of resources, before the event.
And how many now really understand why and how            the system went wrong. It doesn't look as if O'Leary has 
quite got a handle on it. If he is not careful, there will be another "dog's balls" in the making -- and he will be making 
it this time.

   Jun. 1, 2010 (McClatchy-Tribune Regional News delivered by Newstex) -- First off, it's a great quote: "We have 
claims coming from bastards who paid ??30 ($36)and are seeking ??3,000 ($3,600) back," said Ryanair head 
Michael O'Leary.
 The quote is amazing on a couple levels: One, the price of the ticket. Now, having traveled around Europe on 
discount carriers, while living there, I can say he's not exaggerating, the tickets are that cheap.
 But mostly, it's an interesting quote because he's insulting his passengers.
 It is refreshing for the ever publicly aware travel industry to drop the veil for a bit. Also, I would think, he raises a 
very interesting point.
 The idea that a volcano would disrupt European travel for weeks certainly seemed ludicrous before it happened in 
Apri, and to a lesser extent May.
 But, when it did, it raised the issue of who is responsible for expenses when such things do happen?
 From the travelers' perspective, you take off for a week, and it turns into three weeks of unexpected expenses, 
and, well, there goes a year's tuition for a kid in college. It's a heck of a burden. The reasoning for having someone 
else foot the bill, beyond not wanting or being able to afford the bill, is that the ticket was an agreement to get the 
traveler back to wherever they needed to get back, when they needed to get back. By not flying, the airline is 
breaking that contract, so the expenses belong to the carrier.
 From the airline's point of view, they would be flying if it was at all possible to be flying. Safety, however, demands 
that they don't. Safety is, after all, in the interests of the passengers.
Icelandic volcano fallout
 Now, in the United States, the stranded fees aren't are great (well, I don't think they are, I've been stranded several 
times for weather and always gotten vouchers and discounts, but never wholly free food and lodging).
 The European Union is a bit more generous with the airline's money, however.
 O'Leary's argument is that it was the goverments of the EU, after all, who made the decision to ground the flights. 
In this case, info collected later seemed to say that there wasn't a need of the widespread nature of the groundings, 
or the duration. Jet engines can survive some ash, just not a lot of ash. The EU area decisions were based on the 
notion that any ash was too much.
 Which, to me, means O'Leary has a point. His airline, especially, could be hard hit by this, as they have very low 
fares and operate a tight, well, airship.
 But his case seems to be with the governments who made the decision to close the airspace, not the passengers 
who had no way of avoiding the additional costs. And, it would seem, his case is better suited to an argument to 
change the laws and regulations for future instances. As for this past month of Euro Volcano ash, Ryanair had 
agreed to the policies when they sold the tickets, so they agreed to the outcomes.
 Having to pick up the tab for 300,000 passengers, however, would seem to threaten the ability to offer rock-bottom 
pricing in the future.

The S&P 500 imploded 8.2% for its worst May since 1962, a vanished age when the Sahara swept all before it at 
the box office. (The more            things change, the more they            stay the same.) Las Vegas Sands (LVS), up 
12% last week, and SanDisk (SNDK), 12.4% higher and traditionally a            summer safe haven, may thrive in the 
desert but a scorched earth policy left many other equities in ruins. The flash crash and fears of continental 
contagion saw the Dow nosedive 7.92%, its worst May since 1940, although todays Chicken Littles have a lot to 
learn if they think            life was any easier then.
Spain may struggle for a sense of perspective however after a frightful 24 hours in which its debt was downgraded 
and subsequent attempts to sing for its supper were thwarted in a Eurovision song contest won by a German born 
in 1991, the year European integration was codified in a Maastricht treaty her home country has come to rue. And 
from            tar heels to            tar balls its been a tough 12 months for both President Obama and BP Plc (BP). 
Today in economics the Institute for Supply Managements May manufacturing Index is out at 10:00AM Eastern. On

   Jun. 1, 2010 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Budget carrier Ryanair announced 341 million euros ($419 million) in profits for the first quarter of this year, despite 
the economic downturn and a loss during this time last year.
These profits will be whittled away thanks to taxes, an estimated 50 million euro ($61.5 million) loss from the 
Icelandic volcano, and a 3 million euro ($3.75 million) fine the Italy slapped them with for stranding their 
passengers, but considering the state of the economy it's still impressive.
In a further show of strength, Ryanair is going to pay a 500 million euro ($615 million) dividend to shareholders, the 
first time it has done so.
The airline credits a 14% rise in passengers and lower fuel costs as the main reasons for the profits.

 Dramatic real estate price cuts aren't strictly an American thing. The Irish Independent tells the story of the  Lyons 
Demesne estate in County Kildare which has a price drop from 80 million euros  to 50 million euros.  The 600-acre 
Lyons Demesne estate in Kildare was owned by the late Tony Ryan. He founded Guinness Peat Aviation and his  
son Cathal founded Ryanair. Tony Ryan is said to have spent 100 million restoring the state before his death in 
2007.  His restoration won several awards for refurbishment.
Ryan's sons, Declan and Shane Ryan put the property on the market last year with the highest price tag ever seen 
on an Irish house. The Georgian style house was originally commissioned by Lord Cloncurry in 1785 and is on 
nearly 600 acres. It has 19th-century Italian frescoes by artist Gaspare Gabrielli in its drawing room. other features 
include a cinema, gymnasium, indoor swimming pool, wine cellar and seven bedrooms in the main house as well as 
four other bedrooms in a guest wing and staff quarters. The property also has five lodges, formal gardens, and a 
spring-fed lake with a boathouse. The listing is being marketed internationally through Christie's Great Estates.

   May 28, 2010 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Whether you're traveling, banking, renting a car or buying a concert ticket, you're going to be subject to a host of 
fees, some hidden and some blatantly obvious. It's one way companies have to collect more money from you on 
top the price for the actual service.
Here are 10 particularly annoying fees, some of which you can't avoid: 
Airline Preferred Seat Selection Fee
Airplanes are designed to cram passengers into undersized seats like sardines in order to maximize profits. Savvy 
(and tall) travelers have long opted for emergency row seats for some precious extra legroom, while others like to 
be near (or far) from the bathroom. And while the ability to choose a window or aisle seat has traditionally been a 
standard courtesy while purchasing a ticket, some carriers are now charging for this non-service. According to 
Expedia, the worst offenders are United Airlines ($14-$109 for domestic flights, and $89-$109 for international 
flights) and Virgin America ($15-$50), while others, like American and Delta, still let you choose your seat for free, 
both domestically and internationally. At this rate, pay toilets are probably inevitable. Don't laugh, it's            already 
been proposed by Ireland's Ryanair.
Dealer Preparation Fee
Anyone who's ever purchased a new car has probably noticed a "Dealer Prep Fee" in the sticker, which usually 
runs anywhere from $500 to $2,000. So what exactly does "dealer prep" cover? Typically, it involves peeling the 
plastic off the seats and hood, vacuuming the interior, a wash and wax, and maybe topping off the fluids. Most 
people just pay it, but you can try negotiating or just flatly refusing to pay it, consumer advocates say.
 Ticketmaster Service Fees
If you've ever bought a ticket to see a concert, play or sporting event, you've almost certainly dealt with 
Ticketmaster, which enjoys a near-monopoly on live events in the U.S. Ticketmaster is also notorious for assessing 
various fees to the price of tickets. For instance, two $90 tickets to a recent Broadway show wound up costing 
$203.70. That included a facility charge of $1.50 per ticket, a convenience charge of $7.50 per ticket, an order 
processing fee of $3.20 and perhaps the most egregious one, a "TicketFast" fee of $2.50. "TicketFast" allows you to 
print your own ticket and save Ticketmaster the cost of printing and mailing them to you.
Auto Repair Environmental Fees
Fees, fees, fees: 10 annoying charges consumers face
What with global warming, oil spills and deforestation, we're all concerned about helping protect the planet, right? 
So are those "environmental fees" showing up on your auto repair bills a reflection of government-mandated 
regulations for the proper disposal of hazardous materials? Not really. It's actually a case of passing along costs to 
consumers while making the original charge deceptively low. Take auto repair bills, the most common source of 
these fees. Thanks to "environmental fees," an advertised $19.95 oil change may end up costing $25, or a new set 
of tires may run you an extra $20. 
Airlines Baggage Fees
Passengers traveling with bikes, skis or other cumbersome items are used to paying extra fees to haul them. But 
some airlines are now beginning to charge passengers for checked luggage. According to            Expedia, almost 
every major U.S. carrier charges between $15 -$25 for the first checked bag, and $25 to $35 for a second piece. 
The only exception is Jet Blue, which allows one piece for free -- but charges $30 for a second item. This trend has 
yet to go global, since most international carriers (except American) allow you to check one piece of luggage gratis, 
while Lufthansa and Frontier allow two pieces.
Hidden Traffic Ticket Fees 
California has long been an automotive bellwether state, paving the way for the rest of the nation in everything from 
emission standards to drive-thru restaurants. But there's a recent automotive trend in California we hope doesn't 
spread to the rest of the nation: hidden ticket fees used to plug budgetary holes. The            CEO of Southern 
Califonia's AAA explains the base fee for a carpool-lane violation is $100, but nine additional fees, such as a "state 
court construction fund fee"-- despite the fact that most people don't use the court system to handle traffic tickets -- 
brings the total to roughly $440. Some cities even charge "crash fees" for fire and police services rendered at the 
scene of an auto collision, even though general taxes already pay for such services. 
ATM Fees
We've all been there, desperately in need of cash, and no friendly ATM in sight. While technology should be making 
transactions increasingly cheaper, the cost of using another bank's ATM continues to rise. According to            
Bankrate.com,
99.2% of ATMs levy a surcharge, which now average $1.97, up 10% from a year ago. But that's not all, since you're 
getting the shaft from your own            bank too, thanks to its fee for using another company's ATM. The average 
cost of that fee is $1.46, up from $1.25 a year ago. So expect to pay an average of $3.43 for not having enough 
cash on hand. If there's a supermarket nearby, buy something cheap and opt for some cash back instead. 
Airline Fuel Surcharges
Rising fuel costs affect consumers and corporations alike. But while the average Joe can't demand higher pay to 
cover the extra money spent commuting, airlines are happy to demand increasingly exorbitant "fuel surcharges" to 
maintain profit margins. These surcharges first kicked in two years ago for international flights, and will increase by 
an average of $100 per ticket to most European destinations compared to last year,            Bestfares.com found. 
Travel to any German city doubled from $160 in July 2009 to $320 in July 2010. Dublin, which enjoyed bargain-
basement fuel surcharges last year of $14, now costs $184 -- and that's still the lowest fuel surcharge to Europe.
 Currency Conversion Fees
If you're planning on traveling overseas this summer, pay close attention to your credit card bill when you get home, 
since you'll undoubtedly find you paid more than you bargained for thanks to a "foreign currency conversion" fee of 
as much as 3%. One percent of that currency conversion fee is charged by            Visa and Mastercard, which is 
less than the commission you'd typically pay in a foreign exchange office. But            Bankrate.comsays many credit 
card issuers and banks are fleecing customers by tacking an additional 2% on top of that fee without providing any 
additional service. Among the institutions raking in a pure profit at the expense of their customers -- which they 
rarely bother to disclose -- are Bank of America, Citibank and Chase. 
Car Rentals
The question is as inevitable as "do you want fries with that?" Every time you rent a car, the clerk invariably asks if 
you want to purchase collision and supplemental liability insurance, both of which can run anywhere from $15 to 
$50 a day. But chances are good you won't need either of them, since you're probably covered by your 
owninsurance policy. Some credit cards also offer rental car insurance as well when you use them to rent an 
automobile. So be sure to check with your insurance and credit card company next time you plan to rent a car. And, 
depending on where you are, there's a chance you'll get charged fees for such normal overhead as "concession 
fee," "security fee" or "licensing fee."

   May 27, 2010 (The Economist delivered by Newstex) -- 
    Gulliver       Ticket sales       A.B. | LONDON       Why airlines may not be pricing their tickets very effectively    
THE            Economics Focus in this weeks Economist reports on pricing mechanisms and their effect on 
consumers. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT), Britains main competition-policy watchdog, has examined how buyers 
are affected by the way prices are presented. One of the five mechanisms considered is œdrip pricing, where only 
part of the price is revealed at first and extra charges are levied as the sale progresses. It will be familiar to anyone 
who has bought a ticket online and wondered at the priority-booking, checked-bag, credit-card and myriad other 
charges that can turn a seemingly decent ticket price into something rather uglier.
According to the OFTs tests, which involved a two-shop scenario, drip pricing led shoppers to make worse 
decisions than those made under any other pricing structure.
In the drip-pricing frame, for instance, more than a quarter of consumers bought at the first shop when it would have 
been wise to continue the search.
The deeper causes of these errors vary. In the drip-pricing and baiting frames [where a cheap deal is advertised but 
restricted to a few lucky shoppers] it seems that shoppers, having resolved to buy a good, feel as if they already 
own it.
But what is particularly surprising is the OFT's conclusion that the suppliers themselves dont benefit from any of the 
pricing strategies considered.
Although consumers clearly lost out there were no corresponding overall gains for retailers. Sales volumes were 
virtually the same whichever way prices were presented.
Just before you splutter, "What on earth are Ryanair doing then?", you should read the whole article for a full 
explanation.

 What would you do if a technical problem on your e-commerce website meant that wrong pricing information was 
posted for some time; customers took advantage of the low prices and, by the time you spotted it, the mistake 
added up to $1.6 million?
Heres what Zappos did in relation to their 6pm.com online store:
[...] While we're sure this was a great deal for customers, it was inadvertent, and we took a big loss (over $1.6 
million “ ouch) selling so many items so far under cost.  However, it was our mistake.  We will be honoring all 
purchases that took place on            6pm.com during our mess up.  We apologize to anyone that was confused 
and/or frustrated during out little hiccup and thank you all for being such great customers.  We hope you continue to 
Shop. Save. Smile. at            6pm.com.
An entirely different outcome springs to my mind that some companies would adopt “ think of those            
champions of customer engagement Ryanair, for instance. Thank goodness so few are like Ryanair.
Nice one, Zappos. Youre the model. Such an apt tag line to your logo.

 Ryanair has been handed a nasty blow to its business model in Germany when their federal court banned the 
budget airline from charging credit card fees on flight reservations. 
The case was brought against Ryanair by the German consumer protection agency who complained about the fee. 
Every ticket booked for Ryanair flights comes with an additional fee, varying between $2 and $5, and there is no 
way to avoid paying it. 
Because Ryanair does not offer an alternative payment method, the courts dismissed the Ryanair argument that the 
bank processing fees are simply being passed on to consumers. In their verdict, the courts said the airline must 
provide an "established" payment method that does not require any extra effort or cost. 
This verdict is just another blow to Ryanair in Europe - recently the airline was hit with a three million Euro fine for 
not aiding stranded passengers. In the end, if Ryanair does start including credit card fees in their ticket prices, it'll 
most likely mean ticket prices will simply go up. 
Ironically, the court verdict came at the same time Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary was in Germany to announce a 
major investment in Frankfurt for a new maintenance facility.

New Transport Secretary of State, Philip Hammond, and his deputy, Theresa Villiers “ undeservedly omitted from 
the Cabinet “ have many transport issues to address. Which are the priorities?
First on aviation; the decision to scrap BAs third runway project at Heathrow is sensible. However, the proposed 
expansions of both Gatwick and Stansted should continue. But the BA/Heathrow problems will not disappear. BA 
has three chronic problems “ aggressive competition, especially in Europe from Ryanair and Easyjet, seemingly 
intractable union differences and the accursed c£3 billion pension deficit. Every effort must be made to turn round 
BA. The eventual aim should be a highly competitive, non-union airline, preferably without any pension schemes, 
and with legacy liabilities being transferred elsewhere. As for Heathrow, the Department should seriously consider 
how it can auction off landing slots on a similar basis to the mobile spectrum.
On the trains, sorting out Network Rail “ with a governance body more reminiscent of the hapless Football 
Association “ is a priority. Its soaring net debt - £23 billion “ should be cut. Train franchises require attention. 
Longer, larger franchises are preferable. Prescribing an integrated franchise, similar to the Isle of Wight model, 
should be tried as a pre-requisite to the eventual integration of the network.
On the underground, close liaison is needed with TfL to ensure that the massive capex overruns of the past do not 
recur. Furthermore, the very expensive Crossrail project should be deferred until public borrowing falls.
Action on the roads is less urgent, but the priority should be plugging bottlenecks and filling potholes “ and 
forgetting yet more bus market investigations.
Improving the UKs docks is important. Hence, the controversial Dibden Bay project should be reviewed, whilst the 
larger Trust Ports should be modernized “ and preferably privatized.
Transport “ Onto the Right Track
No shortage of issues?

   May 17, 2010 (The Economist delivered by Newstex) -- 
    Gulliver       Gulliver's awards       A.B. | LONDON       The losers in our airlines and airports poll    
THERE are no surprises in the results of Gulliver's incredibly unscientific recent            poll. The least favourite 
airport of our            63 commenters is London Heathrow. Their least favourite airline is Ryanair.
Heathrow scored 11.6 points?under this system, some votes counted as fractional if the commenter nominated 
more than one facility as a "least favourite". Why does Heathrow disappoint so many? The reason seems to be 
summed up by the vagueness of one commenter when explaining their choice: œI think just for that sinking feeling 
in my stomach when I realise I'll have to go through it, I'll plump for Heathrow. The difficulty of navigating around it 
and the problems with lost luggage were also mentioned more than once. Second place went to Paris Charles de 
Gaulle, with just over eight votes. LAX was third.
My favourite rant was probably this one, although as an Englishman I obviously object strongly to the last phrase.
Europe: Heathrow wins, with CDG [Charles de Gaulle] a close second. Let's see, what's that cute adjective the Brits 
use to describe surprise? Oh, yes, gobsmacked. With an emphasis on the smacked, which is how my partner felt 
after a really horrible experience with LHR security that caused him to throw out about half his clothing from an 
"excessive" bag. We now consciously avoid any flight that would have us transfer at LHR. CDG is another 
sprawling, ineptly-designed, badly-signposted disaster filled with staff recycled from Soviet telephone offices, but at 
least they're French so they're easier to look at.
Among the airlines, Ryanair scraped past US Airways (NYSE:LCC)  to take first place. With 5.5 votes to his 
company's name, Ryanair's boss, Michael O'Leary, is unlikely to be losing too much sleep over this particular 
accolade. (Though he rarely if ever gives the impression of losing sleep over any piece of negative publicity.) And 
Gulliver does find himself wondering about the priorities of the two voters who plumped for Emirates.
Here are the top threes:
Unpopular with the readers
Least favourite airports: 1) Heathrow 11.58, 2) Charles de Gaulle 8.17 3) LAX 3.33

   May 17, 2010 (Samizdata delivered by Newstex) -- 
           Lviv, Ukraine. April 2010 
On April 21 this year, I was in Odessa, on the Ukrainian Black Sea coast. I was booked on a scheduled Ryanair 
flight from Katowice in Poland the following evening at 8.25pm. No flights had flown out of Poland or into England 
for a week, but I had suddenly been informed that I had 27 hours in which to get at Katowice airport. 
I have written a lengthy piece about this journey, giving history, sundry political and economic observations, and a 
description of just how I came to be in Odessa on April 21. Unfortunately, this blog post somehow managed to 
come to over six and a half thousand words, which is perhaps excessive.
Therefore, I have done some editing. The introduction to the post that gives all the background is on my own blog       
     here. On Samizdata, I will post from the point where the action starts. 
           
The first step was to get from the Black Sea coast to the Polish border. There was a train departing Odessa for Lviv 
at 7.00pm. I purchased a ticket.
There are three classes of ticket for overnight trains in the former USSR. The cheapest, 3rd class, is called 
platzkart. Platzkart carriages contain 54 beds. There is very little privacy, inadequate toilent facilities, and travelling 
platzkart has a certain            reputation. ("The basic layout is essentially a copy of the old slave ships, or perhaps 
the GULAG camps"). However, travelling this way is very cheap. 2nd class is kupe. Carriages contain 9 
compartments, each containing four beds, with an upper and lower bunk on either side of the compartment. There 
is more privacy, and more comfort and space. Tickets cost about twice the cost of platzkart - for a journey from 
Odessa to Lviv my kupe ticket cost the equivalent of about £10. 1st class is spalny wagon, which consists of 
compartments containing two beds each. This costs three or four times as much as kupe - not hugely expensive by 
western European standards, but a considerable premium. So, I choose kupe. I bought a ticket to Lviv. Even this is

not always easy when timetable information in the station is entirely in Cyrillic, you have no common languages with 
the railway staff, and the very badly paid staff themselves received their customer service training in the Soviet 
Union. But I managed it.
           
Of course, in a kupe carriage, you share a compartment with three other people, and it is luck as to who you get. I 
prepared myself for the journey. The custom on long Eastern European train 
 journeys is for passengers in the same train compartment to have something resembling a picnic in the 
compartment. People pack food - often things like cheese, bread, and cold meats - and these things are shared at 
meal times. I went to a shop near the main train station and purchased some bread, cold sausage, cheese, and 
tinned fish, and was prepared for a little socialising if the people sharing the compartment were friendly. I also made 
sure I had a charged laptop with a spare battery, the previous evening's episode of Lost on the hard disk, an 
assortment of movies, and a couple of good books.
So I was ready. I boarded the train and was guided to my compartment. There were three other people with me: a 
respectable looking married couple about my own age, and a younger man. I sat down. The younger man insisted 
on speaking to me and the other passengers incessantly in Russian. There was a lot of beer, vodka, and a few 
inscrutable food items on the table. His breath smelled of something including but not limited to beer. He insisted on 
talking incessantly for the half hour or so I sat there with the two other. The married couple sat there largely in 
silence with rather stern expressions on their faces, although the husband greeted me in accented but quite decent 
English.
After about a half hour of this, the married couple got up departed the compartment. The younger drunk Russian 
stayed for a bit longer, and attempted to get me to share his beer. After a while I perhaps foolishly took a swig. A 
few minutes after this, he attempted to get me to share the marijuana he had stashed in his sock. He wasn't just 
drunk. I declined on the marijuana. After a time he also got up and left the compartment. (Yes, he was probably 
Ukrainian rather than Russian, but as a state of mind, one enters Russia when one gets on a train anywhere in 
Russia, Ukraine, or Belarus. One just does).
Not long after this, the husband (but not the wife) of the other couple returned. As it happened he spoke very decent 
English: accented when he spoke but his comprehension was excellent; the sort of English that someone has when 
he has spent time working in places and environments where it is useful to be able to speak English and where it 
has been picked up along the way. He asked me where I was from. When I told him I was Australian he commented 
that my English was easy to understand. Many Australians speak heavily accented and idiomatic English, but I 
didn't. I spoke heavily accented and idiomatic English for a couple of sentences, and we both laughed. He told me 
about his travels in the Middle East and Asia. We compared notes on Dubai and Malaysia. He seemed a nice bloke 
- exactly the sort of company one hopes for in a train in a foreign country.
However, this was not to last. His wife soon returned and they had a discussion in Russian. I was told that they 
were going to a compartment in another carriage, as "he" would undoubtedly return soon, and they needed to get 
some rest. I was not unsympathetic to their point of view, but I was not pleased by this development. Given the 
choice of sharing a compartment with two sensible people and a drunk and stoned Russian nutter, or with just a 
drunk and stoned Russian nutter, I knew which I preferred. This clearly showed on my face. My English speaking 
friend translated one last phrase from his wife, directed at me. "Good Luck".
Of course, I was not expecting good luck, and I did not get it. My drunk and stoned friend returned a while later. By 
this time I had settled down on my top bunk with a book, but he still wanted my intention. More incessant speaking. 
Attempts to slap my hand with his hand. Attempts to shove beer and vodka in my direction, followed by more 
incessant talking and unpredictable reactions when I refused. After about half an hour of this, he departed again, 
thankfully.
In order to comprehend the full experience of the rest of this journey, more of the customs of Russian train travel 
need to be revealed. Firstly, each carriage has a provodnitsa (provodnik if male, but they usually seem to be 
Smoked fish thrust at me after midnight, and cigarette smuggling in the snow.
female) who is an attendant who checks tickets, provides bed linen, cleans compartments, offers coffee at the start 
and end of the journey, and is generally in charge of the carriage. Secondly, overnight trains make long stops. At a 
major station the train may stop for up to an hour in the middle of the night. When this happens, vendors selling 
food, drink, and other items appear on the platforms of the station, and passengers often get off to buy items from 
them.
Consequently, my journey developed a rhythm. My obnoxious friend would come into the carriage and irritate me 
for half an hour or more, before getting restless. At that point, he would vanish to somewhere else on the train for a 
time. If there was a stop, he would clearly leave the train. Shortly afterwards, he would reappear in the compartment 
with various items, and would talk incessantly in Russian and would thrust whatever he had bought in my face, and 
perhaps attempt to high-five me again.
What can I say? Having two smoked fish and a bottle of Ukrainian beer thrust in your face at midnight when you are 
trying to sleep is one of those things that is perhaps better to write about later than to experience at the time. But it 
does make a good story later.
The next phase in the rhythm would be that the items that had been purchased on the platform at the stop would be 
placed on the table in the compartment, and my obnoxious friend would again get restless and wander to 
somewhere else in the train. At that point the provodnitsa (who was aware she had a problematic passenger) would 
come into the department and take away all the beer, vodka, illicit drugs, smoked fish etc that were on the table. 
There was no direct confrontation - just a sort of attempt to moderate the problem. In one of these intervals I got my 
laptop out, and managed to watch Lost. I pulled the memory card out of my camera, and was just starting to sort out 
my holiday snaps when my friend returned, so I put the laptop away as I did not know how he would respond. 
Similarly, I was reluctant to get out my own food, as I did not know whether he would demand some as part of 
Russian train etiquette, or any of a number of other weird reactions.
At about 1am, the provodnitsa came in, made my obnoxious friend's bed, and then clearly went somewhere else 
and encouraged him to come back to the compartment. She then spoke to him for what seemed like about an hour 
in the sort of way a particularly patient mother would speak to a particularly troublesome small boy. I could only 
think, what a horrible job. If you behaved like this on a train in western Europe, you would be thrown off the train at 
the next station, and likely be greeted by police who would take you off and throw you in a cell. However, in the 
Ukraine, the only power apparently available to the provodnitsa is to attempt to pacify the passenger. She has 
apparent authority, but is backed up by very little power or actual authority.
In any event it didn't really work, for after she left, so did my obnoxious friend, and his cycle of going, coming back 
and being annoying continued. I was concerned that at some point he would vomit and/or urinate, but thankfully this 
did not happen, a small mercy I suppose.
At about 3am, after yet one more such incident, I finally lost my temper. After another attempt to gain my attention, 
slap hands with me, and share beer with me from my friend, I got up and swore at him, loudly and in English. I 
cursed him. I cursed his mother. I cursed his country. I expressed the view that the Mongol sacking of Kiev in 1240 
had been not nearly comprehensive enough for my liking. I managed to use pretty much every obscenity in the 
English language that is not a racial epithet. I responded to being slapped by slapping back. He made a gesture 
suggesting I join him in the corridor outside, but nothing came of that.
And oddly enough, soon after that he did finally go to bed again and fall asleep. I got a little sleep myself, too, but it 
was only a few hours to our arrival in Lviv at 7am. The provodnitsa woke us at that point. My obnoxious friend at 
this point insisted on buying me a cup of coffee, and shaking my hand as he left the carriage.
However, when I left the carriage, I was shattered. I had hoped for a restful night, and I hadn't got one. I walked off 
the train, and it was very cold. I sort of struggled to the nicest lounge in the railway station - the one with the 
admission charge and Wifi. I sat down and had a coffee. After a while I got out my laptop and attempted to check

train times. After a bit of struggling with websites, I discovered that there were two trains a day from Lviv to 
Przemysl on the other side of the Polish border, one at 23.59 and the other at 7.18. It was about 8.00am. I could 
have made the 7.18 after arriving in Lviv, but I had been too shattered to think about it at the time.
Actually, it was worse than that. Some of the carriages on that 7.18 had actually come from Odessa, on another 
train that had departed there at 6.13pm the previous evening. I could actually have gone to Przemysl directly from 
Odessa. But, as I said, figuring out the timetables in Cyrillic had not been easy.
On the other hand, two trains a day. That Silesian corridor between Lviv and Wroc??aw was once one of the 
centres of the Austrian and then Prussian empires - one of the most advanced and populous areas of central 
Europe. Now, two trains a day.
But of course there were road options to get to Przemysl, and I still had 13 hours in which to get to Katowice. It was 
only 400km. The main bus station in Lviv, was, however, about 8km south of the city centre. I could get there by 
getting a couple of trams. I got one to the centre of Lviv. Another would get me to the bus station. It seemed my 
best bet. 
           
However, after the first tram, still shattered. I passed a cafe where I knew there was power, Wifi, more coffee, and a 
good breakfast to be had. I went in.
Over breakfast, more googling. Websites suggested that entering Poland from Ukraine could be difficult, and that 
buses could be delayed "up to nine hours". Other websites suggested that crossing the border on foot could be a 
good deal faster, if you had an EU or other rich country passport. Also, it was possible to get a marshrutki - a 
privately owned minibus that goes when it has enough passengers and stops when and where passengers ask - 
what transport nerds in other countries call a            jitney - to Shehyni (??????--). Of course, this went from the 
main train station. I therefore got another tram back to the station, and after wandering around for a bit found the 
marshrutki with "??????--" on the front.

The ride to the border took an hour and a half. We went down an adequate road with a major European route 
number through many picturesque towns with beautiful churches and agriculture. There were many horse drawn 
vehicles, and fields being ploughed with animal and human labour nearby. This place is poor. Still, I was moving in 
the right direction. One of the cardinal rules of the ancient Confucian art of going with the flow (travel version) is to 
take any opportunity to move in the right direction, and I was moving in the right direction. I was concerned that I 
was going to have difficulty crossing the border.
As it happened, no problem. I got to Shehnyi. The queue to cross the border by road was extremely long and slow. 
The border features a lot of fencing and barbed wire, with a no man's land in the middle. This is an external border 
of the EU and of the Schengen area. This is a serious rich/poor border. 20 years after the end of communism, 
Poland is in many ways a fairly normal western country. Ukraine, not.

I walked across. Immigration turned out to be childishly simple, for me, anyway. As at many European borders, 
there were two lanes, one for "EU, Swiss and other EEA passports", and one for "Other passports". They may as 
well have just said "Poles", and "Ukrainians", or even "Rich", and "Poor". I was traveling on my British passport, so I 
walked down the EU line, which took me straight to the front of the line. The "non-EU" line was long and slow. My 
hunch is that if I had produced my Australian passport or an American or even a Brazilian passport, I would have 
been directed down the "EU" line. The global apartheid that allows people born in some places to move freely and 
people born in others to not move freely was as starkly evident has as anywhere I have seen. In truth, this was the 
starkest Rich/Poor border I have ever seen. Last time I crossed the Mexico/US border on foot I was made to queue 
like anyone else. American border guards go for equal opportunity humiliation, and that is perhaps fairer, if less 
convenient to me.
Smoked fish thrust at me after midnight, and cigarette smuggling in the snow.
However, having gone through immigration, I still had to go through customs, and that was what this was all about. 
The entire purpose of this checkpoint is to prevent people smuggling cigarettes. Everyone crossing the border was 
getting their luggage searched. Everyone was carrying two packets of cigarettes - 40 cigarettes in total.
As it happened, this was perhaps a problem for me, as I was carrying 200 cigarettes. I occasionally bring cigarettes 
back to the UK for Thaddeus Tremaine, on the basis that they are much cheaper in many of the places I visit than 
they are in the UK. I had bought some in the Ukraine for him, and had assumed I would be able to bring the 200 
cigarettes I am permitted when I enter the EU by air. I suddenly had a problem.
I decided that I would try the "Who, me? I am British." trick. The cigarettes were in the bottom of my rucksack. The 
official asked me "Cigaretten?" or something similar in something resembling German. It was clear he did not have 
much English. I could say "yes", and be asked how many, or I could say "no". However, that would be lying, and in 
such situations it is very important not to lie, as this can lead to trouble. Therefore, I instead said "Only a few" in the 
hope that he would not understand. This worked, but he still gestured for me to open my bag. I opened the 
compartment with my dirty underwear and socks in it. That worked well, and he gestured for me to close the bag 
without further checks. I walked on.
I was in the border crossing at the small Polish town of Medyka. Border crossing points are like military bases - they 
have the same shabby prefabricated look worldwide. This was no exception. There was a small supermarket, a few 
bars, some shabby shops selling vaguely Eastern European themed trinkets, money changers, etc.
One thing that was relatively unique to here was that there were a large number of elderly Ukrainian women, all 
holding two packets of cigarettes and one bottle of vodka to people who walked past. The Ukrainian side of the 
border was so poor that it was worth these women's while to queue for three hours in the cold in order to make a 
profit consisting of the difference between Ukrainian and Polish taxes on two packets of cigarettes and one bottle of 
vodka. These things are not expensive in Poland. The profit for such a journey would be less than $5 - possibly a 
good deal less. Middle aged and elderly women are the people who hold the country together - I saw this on the 
train and in many other places - and I felt a certain sympathy that comes from getting a poor lot in life.
I did something impulsive. I walked up to the nearest of these women, and simply handed her the relatively small 
amount of Ukrainian currency I had in my wallet. This was not much - the equivalent of six or seven dollars - but I 
just felt like doing it. She looked at me with surprise, but took the money.
However, ten minutes later, I realised that had not perhaps been a great idea. I had very little other money of any 
kind on me, and there were no cash machines near the border. There were plenty of money changers, but that was 
all. And there was no frequent transport - no jitneys here. Being a modern western country means that the state 
runs (or at least regulates) public transport, so obviously it is a lot worse. There were a few white minibuses 
carrying workers of various kinds to pre-arranged destinations. I could probably have done a deal with one of these 
people to take me to Przemysl, but I had no cash. This was still insurmountable - "Take me to a cash machine in 
Przemysl and I will then pay you" can be communicated, but these people spoke little English and it was relatively 
difficult to communicate. It would have been easier to have just held up some banknotes and asked "How much". If 
I had kept the Ukrainian money, I would have been able to change it to Zloty and I would have had less of a 
problem. However, I hadn't.
I did have about four Zloty ($1.20) on me, however, and there was a municipal bus, but it only came once every 
couple of hours. So I waited. I had no money, but (as it happened) I had some cold sausage, bread, cheese, and 
tinned fish with me, so I made myself lunch.
In a way this was worth it, because in that time, I saw something. A black van pulled up near the border. The black 
van was mobbed by elderly white haired Ukrainian women, thrusting their cigarettes and vodka through the 
windows, and being handed small sums of money. This went on for about sixty seconds. At this point another van, 
with some sort of official logo and flashing lights on top pulled up and honked its horn. The elderly Ukrainian women 
Smoked fish thrust at me after midnight, and cigarette smuggling in the snow.
dispersed. There was no attempt to detain or arrest anyone - merely to stop the women onselling their cigarettes. 
The black van drove slowly off. I gave the driver the thumbs up. He smiled.
It was better than that, though. As this went on, the skies opened and snow fell. I felt like I was in a cold war movie.
I waited the hour and a half. The bus came. I had soon traveled the 10km to Przemsyl Glowny railway station, 
noticed that there was a train going to Wroc??aw at 13.42. Great. Everything was under control. I might even have 
the chance to quickly visit the Katyn memorial in Katowice before heading for the airport. I bought a ticket. The 
ticket seller was a helpful young woman who looked like she was paid reasonably and had decent working 
conditions. I had about 45 minutes. I went from a brief walk around Przemysl: another of those nice central 
European cities. Nice church. Nice square. You could spend a nice couple of days here. I found a cash machine, 
and a bar, and ordered a ?ywiec. The beer was good and cold. Seldom have I enjoyed one more.
I got out my laptop and my camera. My hand brushed across the side of the laptop, and felt a memory card sticking 
out. I swore. I had put the laptop away hurriedly when the drunk Russian returned to my compartment in the middle 
of the night, and I had not returned the memory card to the camera. Thus the photographs of the border and its 
barbed wire, long and short queues, and the snow falling on the cigarette smugglers had not been saved. (Just why 
my otherwise splendid            camera pretends to take photographs when it has no card, I do not know). I did not 
swear as savagely as I had in the middle of the night, but I swore a little bit.
Still, that was life. Things like this happen occasionally. It was still a good story. I have borrowed a couple of 
photographs that I did not take myself for this part of the journey, but the loss of the photograph of the two vans, 
one being mobbed by elderly Ukrainian women in the snow is a shame.
 I boarded my train.
           There were way more stops than this. False advertising. 
Soon, I realised that this train was not going quickly. Still, I had five and a half hours, and the distance was less than 
300km. Not to worry. On the other hand, I was starting to wish I had checked the arrival time of the train in 
Katowice. And there was clearly no way I was getting to the Katyn memorial. Still, the train plodded along. It may 
have been quicker to get the bus, as Poland has spent more money on roads than railways since freedom. 
Eventually, though, we got to Krakow, At 5.30pm. There was still no problem if we were in Katowice by 7.00pm, and 
it was only 80km. I was getting a bit nervous, but it still seemed doable. I knew there was a bus service from 
Krakow to Katowice airport, but I did not know the times. The road from Krakow to Katowice is extremely good (this 
is the most densely populated area in Poland), and the bus would get me there pronto, but I did not know if there 
was one at the right time, so I stayed on the train. There was a bus every half hour from Katowice to Katowice 
airport, and I would surely be there in time. In the worst case scenario I could get a taxi.
Short as the last section of the journey was and important as the city pair was, the journey was really not fast. I nice 
girl of about 20 carrying a case containing a stringed instrument got into my compartment at Krakow. Her boyfriend 
helped her onto the train with her luggage, kissed her and seemed to wish her luck in Wroclaw, and left the train. I 
said hello in English and she smiled and greeted me warmly back. She studied sheet music as the train went on. 
Wroclaw contains a particularly beautiful concert hall. I imagined for a moment that she was going there to play, but 
she probably wasn't.
The journey from Krakow to Katowice is a strange one. The first section is in beautiful rolling hills in the valley of the 
river Vistula. Krakow itself is a heartbreakingly beautiful city. The train on the next platform was going to 
O??wiÄcim, a place better known outside Poland by its German name, and another reminder of the terrible history 
of this part of Europe.
The train then goes through the Upper Silesian Metropolitan Area, the largest metropolis in Poland. This is an 
industrial heartland that was built by the Prussians and Germans, and then later run in that delightful way that 
communist governments ran industry. In 1989 it was one of the most polluted places on earth. Poles from 
elsewhere still make faces and express puzzlement when you say you have been there. 
Smoked fish thrust at me after midnight, and cigarette smuggling in the snow.
           
Now though, it is a strange mixture of industrial, urban, and other. You pass through one centre of communist 
housing, then you pass the somewhat desolate (but recovering) forest, then an older town with a beautiful church, 
then a coal mine, then repeat, not necessarily in the same order. As you approach Katowice itself, the urban 
sections get larger. Katowice itself contains international hotels, shopping streets, bars and restaurants, small 
shops, large malls, and all the things you find in a civilized urban environment. It is a modern western city. I rather 
like it.
But there was no time to like it in this instance. The Upper Silesian metropolitan area is a federation of 14 cities, and 
the train seemingly stopped at all of them, traveling very slowly between. Eventually we got to Katowice station. I 
wished the nice musician girl a good day and sprinted off the train. I went to another cash machine and withdrew 
money for cab fare. The bus to the airport was due to depart in a few minutes. It was a nice modern bus, and would 
generally have been a highly efficient way of getting to the airport, but it was 7.35pm, my flight departed at 8.25pm, 
and I had no idea how chaotic the airport was going to be, given that this was the first flight to London in a week. 
Ryanair had stated that gates would close 40 minutes before departure rather than the normal 30, and although the 
30 is not normally enforced if you have checked in online, I had no idea what the situation would be. Given I was 
rushing for my original scheduled flight that had not been cancelled, I was concerned that the consequences would 
be severe if I missed it. Perhaps I would have to wait for days for another flight with a seat. And I had no idea how 
much I would be charged if so.
So I jumped into a taxi and asked the driver to take me to the airport. The taxi was a new silver Mercedes. Katowice 
airport is about 55km from the centre of the city (although it is in the metropolis). There are motorways all the way. 
The driver instantly realised that I was in a hurry (or perhaps he just liked driving his silver Mercedes fast, as this is 
what it was designed for), so we sped down the motorway. I watched the meter tick over at high speed. 50 Zloty. 
100 Zloty. 150 Zloty. This was as expensive as taking an equivalent taxi journey in Germany. Poland is generally 
cheap, but if you behave like a rich European you will be charged like a rich European, and that includes staying in 
an international hotel of getting a Mercedes taxi to the airport. 200 Zloty. 250 Zloty. 300 Zloty.
And it was still a bit more than that when we got to the airport. But we got there, at about 8pm. The success of a 
journey of 27 hours had ended up coming down to a frantic last fifteen minutes. I had not withdrawn enough money, 
so I rushed to another cash machine, went back and paid the driver, went through security, and got my belt horribly 
caught in my trousers as I desperately tried to take it off to put through the X-Ray machine.
At that point, though, the security guy made a gesture that translated roughly as "Relax". He could see my flight 
boarding in the distance, and there was still a queue and there was really no trouble making the gate in time. I didn't 
quite relax, but I slowed down. A Polish immigration guy scanned my passport. I walked to the gate and boarded 
the plane. At this point I could relax. I would be asleep in my own bed that evening. As I was.
It was a stressful but interesting journey. And it ended well. I could have done without the taxi fare at the end 
(which, incidentally, cost more than the train from Odessa to Lviv, the marshrutki to the Polish border, the bus to 
Przesmyl, the train to Katowice, the flight to London, the train from Stansted Airport to London, and the bus from 
Liverpool St Station to my home, put together). But one is hit by an unexpected expense once in a while, and the 
taxi driver got me to my flight, for which he has my thanks.

 Back during April's travel mess, the European Union warned Ryanair because Ryanair refused to compensate 
stranded passengers for lodging and food. The EU told them they were legally required to, and the budget carrier 
backed down.
Here comes the sequel to that story.
Italy has slapped Ryanair with a three million euro ($3.75 million) fine for not providing 178 people at Rome's 
Ciampino airport with help required under EU Regulation 261. This includes lodging and food that the airline was 
supposed to give stranded passengers.
Ryanair is denying the charges so this will probably end up in court. Ryanair will almost certainly bring up a 
provision in the regulation stating that, "obligations on operating air carriers should be limited or excluded in cases 
where an event has been caused by extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided even if all 
reasonable measures had been taken."
Italian officials, however, have pointed out that most other airlines offered food and hotels for the duration of the 
shutdown. Plus            Ryanair's own website says that you're covered by EU261, "If your flight is cancelled, for 
whatever reason."
Considering that an estimated eight million passengers were affected by April's volcanic eruption, this is probably 
only the first in a long series of legal actions.

    Gulliver       British Airways strikes       A.B. | LONDON       Is British Airways trying to break its unions?    
WHOD be a British Airways passenger? Yesterday the airline's cabin crew said they would be holding five four-day 
strikes, running from May 18th to June 9th inclusive, with just 24 hours of activity in between stoppages. The timing 
will be of maximum inconvenience to passengers, as this busy period includes bank and half-term holidays.
During the two-part strike it faced in late March, BA says it transported around 75% of scheduled passengers 
thanks to contingency measures such as the hiring of other companies' planes and the reassignment of staff to 
cabin-crew roles. But similar results may be harder to achieve this time round because of the sheer volume of 
passengers.
These new strikes were called after cabin crew rejected the BA offer put to them last week. Some hopes do remain 
for their cancellation, but Unite, the union which represents the workers, says this won't happen until BA returns to 
"meaningful negotiations". In Unite's words:
Cabin crew are left with no choice but to take further strike action. There can be no industrial peace without 
meaningful negotiations and while management victimises trade unionists and uses disciplinary procedures in a 
witch-hunt.
In a            letter to the Guardian today, a group of industrial-relations academics voiced similar concerns, saying 
that the cabin crews' grudge relates more to the way BA has dealt with activist employees and the strike itself than 
with disagreements over pay and conditions.
It is ironic that the original issues in the dispute now have been resolved and that the sticking points derive from 
BA's draconian responses to the union's strikes, namely, the removal of staff travel payments and victimisation of 
members for campaigning to make the union's action effective.
Looming strife
Indeed, staff are to be balloted again to assess their reaction to the dismissal of five staff members and the removal 
of flight perks from 55 others who took strike action earlier in the year.
With Unite describing the struggle with BA as a struggle for its own continuing existence within the companys 
workforce, the chances of its backing down remain thin. And with BA in the red, smarting from ash-cloud difficulties 
and doubtless casting jealous glances at the non-union workforces at the likes of Ryanair, the chances of its 
backing down seem similarly slight. An ugly summer beckons.

 Thankfully, the rail system in Europe is quite good but for any long distance travel,            chaos could be 
returning.Air passengers could face further disruption today as northerly winds bring volcanic ash back over Ireland 
and western Scotland.
A number of flights from the UK and Ireland were grounded yesterday as several Spanish airports closed.
They were expected to remain shut until the early hours of this morning as an ash cloud moved over Europe.
Ryanair said airspace over southern France could also be restricted and the airline was expecting to have to cancel 
flights until midnight yesterday.

           Today saw a mobile announcement from award winning Australian airline            Virgin Blue. The airline has 
teamed up with a company called            Mobile Travel Technologies (MTT), which specialises in¦ well, you can 
probably guess. And while airlines adopting mobile tech is            old news by this stage, the actual package being 
launched by Virgin Blue is near perfect, and is what I would hope becomes the global standard.
Whats the service?
This service is aimed at business travelers, but theres no reason for it not to be used for commercial travelers as 
well. Its a free-to-download Blackberry app - but for those without Blackberrys, all of the same functions can be 
accessed at the Virgin Blue mobile website virginblue.com.au.
What does it do?
The following list may seem simple, but its precisely what all airlines need to be doing. You can:
- Check-in over your mobile, and get sent your            mobile boarding pass to store on your device.
- select your seat with an interactive mobile maps
- make changes to flight details
- send your flight details to a contact
What we think?
The problem with checking in on-line is that it doesnt work as well as some airlines think it does. Not everyone has 
easy access to a printer, you see. So, for example, if you dont check in and print out your boarding card yourself 
Virgin Blue launches the œstandard airline package for mobile
with Ryanair, they charge you 40 quid just to print it out. In a recent flight from Schiphol airport, the queue to check-
in wound out of the terminal and down a series of corridors. It was a mess. But everyone has easy access to a 
mobile. And if every airline had a mobile service as good as Virgin Blue in place, things would be much easier.

Im back with part two of the Phoenix Aviation Symposium            airline CEO panel.  In part one, the            CEOs 
talked about consolidation.  In this post, they talk about competing and cooperating with low cost carriers.
On Competing with Low Cost Carriers in Europe
 British Airways CEO Willie Walsh:  I think what weve seen in Europe in 2009 has been more the impact of the truly 
global economic downturn [than low cost carriers (LCCs)].  People in the EU talk about BA losing to Ryanair, 
easyJet.  Theres no evidence to support that.  BA is holding market share relative to these guys because weve 
been competing with them for 20 years.  I think weve been able to adapt to their sort of competition that they 
present us.  Its really a case now that the consumer has choice and can really understand whats available.  So a lot 
of the consumer media in the UK has recognized that theres very little difference in terms of overall price between 
established carriers, network carriers and low cost carriers. 
What we witnessed was a truly awful economic environment.  Ryanair and easyJet suffered as well.  They scaled 
back their growth, saw significant falling profitability and they struggle just as much as everybody else.  The main 
issue for BA was the impact on premium travel.  IATA estimates that 7 to 8% travel in premium and generate 25% 
of revenue.  For BA, 13% travel in premium classes and generate 45% of revenue.  Weve seen some evidence of 
premium customers on short haul within Europe and moving away from the premium cabin.  That doesnt mean 
theyre moving from network carriers to low cost carriers.  It means theyre moving from the front of the aircraft to the 
back, and I think thats a structural change.  Long haul premium travel is cyclical and theres clear evidence that its 
now recovering.  Im convinced from everything Ive seen that the competition between LCCs and national carriers 
will continue.
Qatar CEO Akbar al Baker:  The same is true for LCCs in our region.  Now, its a fashion in our region.  The 
geography does not permit low cost carriers flourishing because we do not have deregulated skies.  We do not 
Five Airline CEOs on Competing and Cooperating with Low Cost Carriers
have secondary airports, we have the same cost base.  We are hardly losing our market share.  Everyone asks 
when Qatar launches an LCC.  We will do it when an LCC entrance into our market will impact share and its not 
happening because people in our region still want to travel on a full service carriers.  They realize there is so much 
of a hidden cost in my region from low cost carriers.  The fare will become nearly the same.
On the Convergence of Business Models Between LCCs and Legacy Carriers
 JetBlue CEO Dave Barger:  I dont think the LCC concept will be gone even though theres a migration thats going 
on . . . .  I dont think the true LCC model goes away. 
Republic CEO Bryan Bedford:  I think the models are converging.  What weve seen through forced financial 
restructuring are legacy carriers that have to rethink their business model.  The product is moved more toward what 
the LCCs have been doing and LCCs have been moving more toward the legacy model “ business class cabins, 
TVs, wi-fi.  Weve seen more amenities on the LCCs;  less amenities on the legacies.  So theres a product 
convergence but the networks are so powerful. 
Moving away from domestic to more balanced between international and domestic.  As these alliances crystalize, 
some of the LCCs are going to wonder where do we go?  How can we move people from small town America to the 
world?  We see Southwest trying to create their own marginal expansion internationally.  At the end of the day its a 
network business, and were trying to figure out ways to differentiate the product because the customer has decided 
to show a great amount of loyalty.
US Airways CEO Doug Parker:  I think youre right, theres definitely a convergence.  I think of it more that we end up 
having lower cost structure but more its hub and spoke airlines vs point-to-point carriers.  JetBlue and Southwest 
connect a lot of people but they dont have a hub and spoke which gives them a cost advantage.  It used to be in the 
90s and 2000s that used to be largely generated by labor costs.  You could have a model that worked; ran a hub 
and spoke out of Phoenix but had much lower costs than the other hub and spoke carriers because we had much 
lower labor costs.  That you cant do anymore because of whats gone on with the legacies. 
You have to get the cost advantage by avoiding hub and spoke.  I dont think you can start an airline doing the same 
thing in a different city and use a cost advantage.  Southwest contracts have higher labor costs but they have much 
lower costs because of their model.  The consumer wont be able to differentiate but the LCCs wont be flying to 
places like Asheville, North Carolina.

 Ryanair CEO Micheal O'Leary played tough guy this week when he told his customers that he wouldn't pay a 
penny to cover expenses resulting from being stranded due to the Icelandic Volcano. 
In statements to the media, he admitted that he was fully aware of EU compensation laws, but chose to ignore them 
claiming:
There's no legislation designed that  says any airline getting a fare of 30 euro (£26) should be reimbursing  
passengers many thousands of euro for hotel accommodation. It's absurd.
Well, unfortunately for Mr O'Leary, there actually is legislation that is designed just for that purpose. In fact, 
European air travelers are one of the most protected groups of travelers in the world. 
As it turns out, European lawmakers may have told Ryanair to re-read the laws he's bound to - because two days 
after his tough statements, the airline took a u-turn and confirmed that they would indeed be refunding passengers 
for "reasonably-receipted expenses".

Thoughts from afar on the            NI leaders debate,  the morning after the night before.
If David Ford had qualified for a seat at the table, could he have done a Nick Clegg.? As the minister of Justice and 
a prime advocate of a shared future, he would have made a difference. How much, well never know “ until next year 
that is, when weve got used to him. Other main points:
The welcome absence of Troubles whataboutery exposed the poverty of œnormal?debate.
 Peter Robinson and Gerry Adams careful not to attack each other, confirming the twin peaks of NI politics. Both 
congratulate themselves on achieving full power sharing.
 The above two escape largely unscathed from their personal troubles. In both cases, no clear grounds of attack 
were discovered. Robinson hints at suing if any fresh attack attempted. Politics as a family business and an opulent 
lifestyle due to politics barely mentioned. All Adams contacts over child abuse scandal were sympathetic, he tells 
us. End of story. Empey and Ritchie are no attack dogs.
Electoral pacts bring the debate to life. Ritchie wins exchanges with the line  pacts are alien to sharing  Adams 
ingratiating with Robinson:  theres nothing wrong with pacts. I congratulate Peter for trying to get one. Ritchie briefly 
looks brave and survives Adams bear hug but not too tight (Careful, shes a woman and this is TV.) Adams sounds 
old school.
No Clegg effect in NI leaders' debate
Adams fends off attacks for continuing Westminster abstention, now that SF have joined all the other bodies. He 
scorns the SDLPs poor voting record and (righty) dismisses exaggerated claims for  the  huge importance œof 
attendance at Westminster to bid for influence in a hung parliament. He adds grandiosely œFor Ford workers I 
negotiated directly with the British Prime Minister.
Regs claims for a direct influence as a potential member of a British government inevitably punctured by Robinson. 
œReg could be chancellor or lobby fodder, I leave it to the voters to decide which is more likely
The statesman falters. Adams smears Ritchie and the SDLP repeatedly with the  very important but entirely 
spurious claim that the SDLPs Thomas Burns went to Afghanistan paid for by the MoD -  the same MoD that tried to 
nobble the Saville Inquiry.  But Ryanair doesnt fly to Helmand. All such visits are under MoD sponsorship and 
protection. It hasnt prevented many MPs from mounting searing attacks on the government. Adams gets away with 
the smear.
Nobody is prepared to be specific on cuts. Robinson claims that Empey as a Conservative supports big cuts this 
year  round about June. Empey replies with promise to cut part of the National Insurance rise.
Adams has most skin crawling out line.  Protestant boys need equality
Who won? No winner for me. Nothing new from a confident Adams or a tired and cautious Robinson. There was a 
certain novelty in Empey speaking for a leading UK party. Ritchie was embarrassing at first as she read from 
opening statement but warmed up and won points for decency, passion and sticking to her guns against Adams. 
But she is still very amateurish. No game changer, this debate.  It was just like the usual round table. You would 
hardly know an election was on.  But at least it was no zoo party.

   Apr. 23, 2010 (Branding Strategy Insider delivered by Newstex) -- 
           
With two weeks to go before the British general election, the media seems to have gone politically bonkers. You 
cant turn a page or switch on the TV without an immediate update on the upcoming election. Marketers are not 
exempt from all this either.
We suddenly seem obsessed with the different marketing strategies being applied by the three major political 
parties. The Lib Dems have gone guerrilla. Labour is relying on user-generated content. And the Tories are using 
traditional, above-the-line media.
Its all very odd because, when you step back from all the rhetoric and look hard at the big parties, its clear that by 
any decent marketing standard, all three are hopelessly inept. Just because there is a ton of money, acres of media 
coverage and huge national importance associated with the upcoming election does not necessarily mean that the 
marketing strategies involved are actually any good.
Take the three brands on offer to the electorate, for example. Are they really differentiated in any meaningful way? 
If you jotted down all the major policy differences between the three parties, what would you write?
Compare that to our world of marketing. A decent marketer will always distinguish their brand from the other major 
competitors. Its basic stuff. You may not love Tesco, Waitrose or Marks & Spencer - but you know what they stand 
for and how they differ from each other. 
This apparent lack of differentiation is made worse by another weakness of political marketing: these parties never 
actually deliver on anything. Any well-managed brand turns positioning into action on a daily basis. The idea of 
paying for a piss on a Ryanair flight may strike you as unfair, for example, but this œtoilet tax is exactly in line with 
Democracy is a Poor Mans Marketing
Michael OLearys positioning of Ryanair as œthe low fares airline that charges for every additional service to keep 
ticket costs down.
 Compare that consistency of delivery with the current Labour government, which was elected in 1997 on a 
manifesto that promised to lower inflation, reduce unemployment, safeguard the environment and clean up politics.
Thirteen years later, the result is a horrendous record of inconsistency and contradiction that any decent brand 
manager would be thoroughly ashamed of. Yet this is the record that Gordon Brown is using to justify another four 
years.
Dont get me wrong, Im not going all Tory on you. David Camerons mob would have been equally indistinct and 
contradictory by now after 13 years in charge. And the other bloke with the Spanish wife too.
Perhaps its hardly surprising that the political alternatives being offered to us are so generic and unreliable when 
you consider the weak competitive forces within politics. The same three parties have been competing against each 
other for over a century. Name me a single consumer market where that is true. 
In the 13 years since Labour came to power, for example, the social media industry has witnessed repeated 
change: SixDegrees was supplanted by Friendster, which lost out to Bebo, which was beaten by MySpace, which is 
now losing out to Facebook.
Any well-managed brand turns positioning into action on a daily basis. Competition creates consumer orientation, 
which in turn makes marketers work harder to ensure their products deliver more. A century of the same old brands 
bereft of new competition explains why our political parties are so lacklustre and why their marketing strategies are 
so poor.
 If you want evidence of that, look at Phillip Gould - the man widely touted as the greatest political marketer of his 
generation. What is the reason for Goulds storied reputation around Westminster? Er, he ran a few focus groups 
and fed the results back to Downing Street. Not exactly rocket science, but for politicians used to waging spin rather 
than engaging in real marketing, it was deemed revolutionary.
The crappy state of modern political marketing is also a result of the inefficient nature of the British political system. 
While supermarkets battle weekly for the affections and loyalty of their target consumers, political parties need only 
to win once every four years to take absolute control of the country and run it with zero consumer orientation for the 
rest of that period.
There are numerous beverage alternatives available to you when you visit a Starbucks. But when it comes to who 
rules your country and what they do while they are in charge, you are restricted to three options and one purchase 
decision every four years.
Democracy is a poor mans marketing.
The reason why British voters are apathetic about the upcoming election is not because of the recession or post-
modern cynicism, its because they are disappointed with the goods on offer. As consumers they have got used to 
genuine choice, branded differentiation and consumer focus. So this year I am voting Tesco, Ryanair, Starbucks or 
Facebook. Stuff the election.

   Apr. 22, 2010 (The Business Insider delivered by Newstex) --
Here's what you need to know this morning:
  Greek bond yields are rising yet again, this time as the EU statistics office found that the country's deficit was            
worse last year than expected. Futures for the            euro and stock indices are responding negatively to the 
continued uncertainty.   President Obama is in New York today making his case to Wall Street for financial reform. 
He is            seeking cooperation on Sen. Dodd's bill, and several changes he wants to see implemented. There 
continues to be significant            political and industry opposition to these moves.   In an apparent pre-Volcker Rule 
move, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)  is set to announce the sale of its private equity investments for            $1.9 
billion to Axa (OOTC:AXAHY) Private Equity. It is believed that under new financial regulations depository firms will 
not be able to have private equity or hedge fund investments.   Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has taken an 
aggressive stance on the SEC case against his firm, saying that the whole thing is            political, and that he 
intends to fight it in court through the proposed jury trial.   Russia is taking advantage of current market confidence 
and offering the second largest emerging market debt offering on record, valued at            $5.5 billion. It will be the 
first time the Russian government has tapped markets since the ruble crisis and default of 1998.   The story of 
China's housing market tightening continues to grow more robust as Hong Kong today launched a further duty to 
quell speculation on high priced residential properties. 
The stamp duty increase targets properties worth more than $20 million.   U.S. telecom giants CenturyLink and 
Qwest have agreed to a merger, where CenturyLink will buy Qwest for $10.6 billion. The resulting company will be 
worth            $19.8 billion in revenues based on 2009 results.   The UK's annual deficit tops anything the country 
has seen since            World War II, as its parliamentary leaders head for their second televised debate. Tonight's 
topic will be            foreign affairs, but the subject of debt will surely arise and polling results after are likely to impact 
pound futures.   European flights have            returned to normal today, as a backlog of stranded passengers finally 
begin to make their way home. Airline            Ryanair, which originally refused to pay stranded passengers 
compensation, is now agreeing to do so.   Bernie Madoff's right hand man, Frank DiPascali, is being charged 
responsible for            $170.25 billion in debts the firm incurred to victims. The government plans to strip him of his 
10 Things You Need To Know Before Opening Bell (Q, CTL, GS )
assets, and sell them in a effort to pay back those who lost money in their investments.   Bonus: The Tiger Wood - 
Elin Woods divorce now looks "           100 percent" likely as the couple were unable to resolve their differences 
over Tiger's sex scandal.

    Gulliver       Volcano reactions       A.B. | LONDON       British Airways finds someone to blame for the current 
aviation chaos    
SO THIS is what is meant by a œdynamic situation. Yesterday afternoon saw much talk of the opening up of 
European airspace after five days' closure, and indeed airports in Italy, Switzerland, France and northern Britain did 
open today. But a new cloud of ash heading south from the Icelandic volcano that is causing the ruckus is now 
exercising meteorologists anew.
Here in Britain, the National Air Traffic Service (NATS), which monitors the country's airspace, says flight 
restrictions won't lift more widely until 1am on Wednesday morning at the earliest. This response has not gone 
down well with British Airways, which sent out a rather peevish statement earlier this afternoon: œWe deeply regret 
the great inconvenience caused to our customers as a result of NATS' decision to close UK airspace over the last 
six days.
Other British airlines refused to stick the boot in. Ryanair was much less peevish when revealing that it was 
extending the cancellation of all flights in northern Europe by 24 hours, to 1pm on Thursday. And bmi sounded 
similarly sanguine as it announced plans to relaunch flights at Heathrow from Wednesday mid-day: "...the decision 
to cancel flights is based on continuing advice from the UK Met Office and NATS (air traffic control), who are 
tracking a cloud of ash which is moving through UK airspace and affecting all airlines." No whingeing there.
Corporations are judged in part by the dignity they show in the face of crisis. We know this is a monumental crisis 
for the airlines, but BA is underperforming.

Whoever thought that the ash crisis would be over by today at some point was wrong.
RyanAir just announced the following:
Ryanair, today (Sun 18th April) confirmed that based on current meteorological forecasts, and the continuing 
emission of volcanic ash into the atmosphere over Iceland, it has decided to cancel all scheduled flights to/from the 
UK, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Holland, France, Germany, Poland and the Baltic States 
until 1300hrs on Wed 21 April.  Ryanair flights from Spain, the Canary and Baleric islands, the south of Italy 
(including Pisa, Rome, Sardinia and Sicily), Malta and North Africa will continue to operate just domestic and 
southbound routes.  This advice is based on the current stable weather trends which continue to blow potentially 
dangerous volcanic ash across the British Isles, Scandinavia and Europe.

 The gains were slim but Greek gifts and a merger Monday still sent the Dow up over 11,000 for the first time since 
September of ˜08 as volatility touched a three-year low. Palm (PALM) 
surged another 17.05% on takeover talk, prompting investors to offer it high fives which went unreciprocated as the 
firm was too busy waving a middle finger at analysts who only a month ago said            shares were worthless. See 
also            Palm Investors Banking on a Miracle. Meanwhile Tiffany (TIF) broke $50 and reached a fresh 52-week 
high as it held out hope (and an expensive index finger) an eight time recipient of its wedding rings was in the 
market for another. Alas Elizabeth, like many a tailor before her, ultimately decided a            stitch in time saves 
nine.
Alcoa (AA) opened earnings season with a revenue miss, although at least its arithmetic is above reproach given 
the caliber of its            audit committee. And investment manager turned author Liaquat Ahameds liquid assets 
increased $10,000 by virtue of his Great Depression era history (Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the 
World) deservedly winning a Pulitzer Prize. Should he pen a sequel on the Great Recession, still going on            as 
of yesterday, the cover need only be changed from            this to            this. On the corporate front CSX Corp 
(CSX), Fastenal (FAST), Intel (INTC), and Linear Technology (LLTC) all expected to report results today.
Initiations
Warnaco (WRC): Sterne Agee starts Warnaco with a Buy and assigns a $58 price target. The broker believes both 
international and retail will provide the fuel for growth in fiscal 2010 and beyond.
Ryanair (RYAAY): Low cost Irish carrier Ryanair is a new Neutral at HSBC. (NYSE:HBC)
Red Hat (RHT): UBS (NYSE:UBS)  resumes Red Hat (NYSE:RHT)  at a Buy.
Upgrades and Downgrades: Going Places With Expedia
Pharmasset (VRUS): The stock is initiated with a Overweight and $35 price objective at JP Morgan.
InterMune (ITMN): The stock is assigned the same rating with a $60 target price.
WW Grainger (GWW): GWW gets picked up at a Buy ($130 target) at Jesup & Lamont. (AMEX:JLI)
Upgrades
ConocoPhillips (COP): The oil stock is upgraded to Outperform from Perform with a $70 price objective at 
Oppenheimer, which cites an announcement that it will sell its 9% stake in Syncrude, the Canadian heavy oil 
project, to Chinas SINOPEC (SHI) for $4.65 billion.
Crocs (CROX): Thomas Weisel takes Crocs to Overweight from Market Weight and maintains its $12 target.
Gold Fields (GFI): The mining stock gets an Outperform-from-Sector Perform boost by RBC Capital. For more on 
this sector, see            Three Reasons to Add Gold to a Portfolio.
Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A): UBS raises its Royal Dutch Shell rating to Buy from Neutral.
Expedia (EXPE): The stock gets a Buy-from-Neutral upgrade at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) , which takes its target 
to $31 from $25 and also adds the shares to their Americas Conviction Buy List.
UnitedHealth (UNH): Leerink Swann lifts UnitedHealth to Outperform from Market Perform.
A123 Systems (AONE): The stock is hoisted to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank. (NYSE:DB)
Education Stocks: Stay in school, kids. ITT Educational (ITT) and DeVry (DV) are each upgraded to Outperform 
from Neutral at Credit Suisse.
Mirant (MIR): The stock is moved to Market Perform from Underperform by BMO Capital.
Downgrades
Alcoa (AA): Dow component Alcoa (AMEX:AA.PR)  (NYSE:AA)  is now Neutral from Buy at UBS.
Heineken N.V. (HINKY): Shares of Dutch brewer Heineken N.V. are lower in London today after an Underweight-

   Apr. 12, 2010 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 What happens when one UK journalist casually bets her apartment on the assumption that no one likes Ryanair? 
Ryanair comes through with a customer satisfaction letter, and demands possession of her apartment. 
The Telegraph journalist Bryony Gordon wagered her London flat against anyone who could prove that Ryanair 
passengers enjoyed their flights. In the article (dated April 7) in the UK daily, Bryony said, "you never hear anybody 
casually mention that they have just flown with Ryanair, and that they really enjoyed it. I am willing to bet my flat 
and its contents that nobody has ever said the words "Ryanair", "marvellous" and "service" in the same sentence." 
Well, you might not have heard those words, Bryony, but Ryanair has, and they want their winnings! Ryanair 
produced a small selection of customer satisfaction letters and even went to so far as to publish the letters on their 
website.  Now, the airline is seeking its reward. 
"Ryanair has provided Bryony with the details of these web-pages and is now seeking the keys to her apartment." 
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said. McNamara went on to say that Ryanair is the world's "favorite airline" and 
"provides the best on-time, baggage and flight completion performance of any major European airline, while also 
offering Europe's guaranteed lowest fares." 
We're not sure exactly how this one is going to play out, but the smart move (OOTC:SMVE)  would be for Bryony to 
bet double-or-nothing her next flight with Ryanair is a good one. Moral of this story: If you're going to place bets, be 
absolutely certain you're going to win.

This week's issue of PlaneBusiness Banter is now posted. Subscribers can access it here.
What are we talking about in this week's issue?
US Airways/United Airlines merger chatter leads off the issue. My column this week takes on the latest "leak" that 
clearly came from the United side of the house. We talk about why that was probably the case -- and then take on 
the pros and cons of a US Airways/United Airlines merger. Again.
I talk about how Continental Airlines fits into all this as well, and why, if I were Continental, I'd be very happy to sit 
on the sidelines and enjoy the perks of the United/Continental partnership. Not to mention CAL's new membership 
in the Star Alliance.
We give you the first quarter stock performance review this week. The top performing airline stock for the first 
quarter was somewhat of a surprise, but the two airlines behind number one were not a surprise.
We also give our usual monthly rundown of the latest DOT Airline Consumer Travel Report numbers. A hint: 
February was a nasty month for weather-related cancellations. Especially for Comair. What the heck happened up 
there in Cincinnati anyway?
Looks like Ryanair is serious about their "Fee for Pee" plan. Meanwhile British Airways has submitted a new offer to 
leaders of its cabin crew union.
All this and much more in this week's issue.

    Gulliver       Ryanair       A.B. | LONDON       When it's right to fight back    
GULLIVER is a fan of Ryanair, even if the budget carrier's refusal to respond to queries is aggravating. A flight last 
week was typical of the service offered: crowded and stressful (thanks mainly to the passengers' insistence on 
pushing and rushing forward at every opportunity) and yet clean, cheap and punctual.
Those who whinge about their Ryanair experience often have the air of diners wondering why they've not been 
served fillet steaks even though they only ordered burgers. A columnist for the Daily Telegraph was at it last week. 
Her article prompted Ryanair to demonstrate a side to its corporate character that Gulliver is surprised to find 
himself liking. Rather than behave in the manner you might expect of a massive corporate machine and place itself 
above such bile, the airline gleefully            responded to the article. Yes the response is half-humorous and half-
peevish, but that's a fair mix. If a commentator is going to sling mud, they should be prepared for some to come 
back their way.

There was a time “ and yes, it was waaay before kids “ when I used to fly quite a bit. I love to travel and when flying 
was cheap and I was carefree (there was such a day), I would pick up and go whenever the urge, frequent flyer 
miles and discount airfares struck me. One weekend, I even flew off to Europe on a whim to meet up with my 
husband, who happened to be working there at the time.
But heres the awful truth: I hate flying. Hate it. And not the actual act of flying “ just the awfulness of dealing with the 
airlines. Airlines have gone out of their way to make the whole experience miserable. My last few flights, even the 
ones for business, have just been horrible (thank you, USAirways). And since I still travel quite a bit for work, that 
can be a real problem: I recently took a 7-1/2 hour train ride to Pittsburgh just to avoid having to deal with the 
airlines.
And yet, the airlines keep insisting on making it worse. USAirways and other carriers charge extra for bags and 
even beverages rather than wrapping those costs into fares (like many service providers). Now, Ryanair, a discount 
carrier to Europe, is taking it a step beyond by imposing a œtoilet tax on their flights. Thats right: youll have to pay 
to pee. The toilets would be coin-operated (make sure that you have the right change when you get on board!) and 
would cost about one Euro per trip to the toilet.
The idea is to reduce the number of toilets on the flight to one (what, no back up plan?) and charge a fee to use it. 
They make more money “ and have more room for seats.
The idea is to encourage people to use the toilet before they board the plane and then œpunish (my word) those 
that dont “ or those that cant control their bathroom urges. Clearly, these people have never spent any time with 
children¦ As the mother of three kids, I can pretty much tell you that would put the kibosh on our family ever taking a 
flight on Ryanair.
Airline Introduces œToilet Tax
But the annoying thing is that Ryanair isnt alone in its determination to make airline travel as expensive as possible 
while pretending its still cheap. Base fares dont mean anything anymore “ by the time you add the            actual 
taxes and surcharges for everything from bags to drinks to blankets. A œtoilet tax is just the next step in a laundry 
list of ways that airlines can make travel more expensive. In fact,            a recent Private Letter Ruling issued by the 
IRS (downloads as a pdf) had so many variations of potentially taxable add-ons for travel that it made my head 
spin.
For what its worth, I understand that airlines are a business and its all about making money. I get it. I run a 
business, too. I just hope to never see the day where I think the best way to boost my profits is to charge my clients 
to use the toilet.Similar Posts: None Found

Everyone's in an uproar over Spirit Airlines' plans to charge            an unprecedented $45 fee for carry-on bags.
But Fast Company co-founder Bill Taylor thinks that all the criticism is misdirected.
Yes, it's a terrible idea, he writes in a post for Harvard Business Review -- but the outrage isn't really about charging 
vs. not charging.
The most important lesson here is that a company's actions should line up with the message it's been sending its 
customers all along. And, unfortunately, Spirit Airlines has never been clear about "what it stands for."
Taylor presents the case studies of two other airlines with very opposite mantras.
On the one hand, there's Southwest, which prides itself on not charging for amenities and even created an 
advertising campaign espousing the fact.
On the other, we have Ryanair, which is infamous for cutting all costs possible and charging for any perk beyond 
sitting in a seat.
Yet both have been incredibly successful while the rest of the airline business is suffering. So this issue can't really 
be about charging or not charging.
Why Spirit Airlines ' Baggage Fee Was Such A Stupid Decision
Rather, Taylor asserts that, from the start, both airlines have been very clear in their messages about what they 
stand for. They set their customer expectations for how they would behave during the recession, and they haven't 
failed to deliver.
Spirit hasn't done so, and Taylor thinks it's going to pay the price with its customers. His lesson to CEOs: "How you 
explain yourselves to the market is as important as what you do in the market."

When the going gets tough, the tough get...naked. 
The cabin crew of Air Comet, a Spanish airline, have come up with a creative way to draw attention to the 
company's recent bankruptcy: a nude calendar. Air Comet isn't the first European airline to have pulled this kind of 
stunt; Ryanair and            Viva Aerobus have also produced more SFW versions.
Through saucy photos that lend further credence to the "           sexy stew" image, the female flight attendants are 
hoping to generate publicity about the 600-cabin crew members' nine months of lost wages. They also hope to earn 
enough to fund their legal battle against Air Comet.
Photo spreads feature the fetching flight attendants in various flight-related poses, including one of a nude woman 
stretched across a jet engine, clad only in an emergency flotation vest.
This is not the first time Air Comet's "air hostesses" have used their bodies to political effect. Last February, one 
woman conducted a naked interview in which she vented her anger at the company's president. How very...Euro.

As if flying these days isnt enough of a hassle, no sooner did Florida-based Spirit Airlines this week announce a 
charge for carry-on bags when word seeped out yesterday that Dublin, Ireland-based Ryanair is pushing ahead with 
(ready for this?) plans to collect between $1.30 and $1.55 for passengers who seek to spend a few moments in its 
aircraft lavatories, notes Grumpy Editor.
This is the stuff that gives hard-working public relations people headaches.
For travelers on Ryanair, the upcoming plan could result in rather expensive extra charges on long trips, especially 
after drinking coffee.  Thats because the airline flies to 153 destinations in 26 countries.
Londons Daily Mail reports Ryanair œis working with Boeing (NYSE:BA)  to redesign the cabin and develop coin-
operated toilets on 168 of its planes. Not content with charging passengers for use of the facilities, the airline is also 
looking at reducing the number of toilets on board, leaving just one available cubicle for up to 189 passengers."
Ryanair figures removing two out of three lavatories can yield at least six extra seats.
And get this thinking relayed (presumably with a straight face) by the airlines PR person:  "By charging for the 
toilets we are hoping to change passenger behavior so that they use the bathroom before or after the flight.
Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines --- which flies to 40 destinations in the U.S., Caribbean and Latin America --- says it will 
be the first carrier to charge for carry-on luggage. 
Starting Aug. 1 (unless it backs down), the airline will nick each passenger between $20 and $45 for one carry-on 
brought on board.
Soon: Try to hold it on Ryanair ; Spirit adds carry-on fee
This after other charges, including $16 per round trip to book via its Web site, $2.50 security fee, $3.70 domestic 
segment tax, $4.50 passenger facility fee, $8 passenger usage fee and $15 to $45 for each checked bag.
With the carry-on fee, Spirits PR person quotes the airlines Chief Operating Officer Ken McKenzie boasting, œthis 
will reduce the number of carry-on bags, which will improve inflight safety and efficiency by speeding up the 
boarding and deplaning process, all of which ultimately improve the overall customer experience.
All is not gloomy.  Exempt from the carry-on charge are infant diaper bags and pet containers.

   Apr. 8, 2010 (The Moderate Voice delivered by Newstex) --
First came the news that one no-frills-type airline            Spirit Airlines was going to charge travelers for bringing on 
their own carry on luggage. That stirred a lot of outrage on talk shows: a lot of people are pissed off.
And now even THAT will cost you (so to speak) if an Airline in Ireland has its way: it wants to charge for lavatory 
use.
The phrase œif youve got go, youve got to go may soon need the phrase œand you better have some change to do 
it, too.
Fresh on the heels of one budget airline announcing that it will ask passengers to pay extra to bring carry-on bags 
on board, another is considering charging them for using the lavatory.
Ryanair, which is based in Dublin, Ireland, and bills itself as œEuropes first and largest low fares airline, is mulling a 
plan that would require travelers to pay either 1 euro or 1 British pound (about $1.33 or $1.52) for using the 
bathroom on flights lasting one hour or less.
If they do this, it may be a case where Irish eyes wont be smiling..
The plan, titled œRyanair Cost Saving Proposal, was published in the airlines inflight magazine.
The carrier said it is working with Boeing (NYSE:BA)  to develop a coin-operated door release so that when nature 
calls, passengers would need to deposit the change before being able to use the facilities.
NO JOKE: Airline Considers Passenger Lavatory Use Fee
The idea is to encourage people to use restrooms in airport terminals before boarding, Ryanair said. If the airline 
were to proceed, the changes would be at least 12 to 18 months away.
The CNN report also contains this detail which shows how the airline is considering the bottom line while being 
inconsiderate of the needs of the nature-calls-ASAP needs of its passengers:
As part of the plan, the airline is also considering removing two of the three lavatories on some of its planes so it 
could squeeze in up to six extra seats. The move would help reduce fares by at least 5 percent, Ryanair said.
Get that great idea?
1. They want to charge you to use their restroom.
2. The waits will probably be longer (anyone who flies knows that on each flight there seems to be someone in the 
restroom apparently writing his or her doctoral thesis or apparently sitting on the throne knitting three pairs of long 
underwear while the line outside of increasingly uncomfortable passengers lengthens).
CNN notes that this isnt the first time the airline has considered a œtoilet fee:
CEO Michael OLeary told the BBC in February 2009 that he was considering the charge.
The problem is, if Ryanair does it and it is successful, you can bet other airlines will at least consider it as well. 
Consumers wont have much they can do about it, except to turn the other cheek.
So in the past flying meant you had to endure leg cramps.
Now, if you fly and dont have the spare change and Ryanair gets its way and it catches on, you may have to endure 
other cramps as well. (Will this lead to an increase in adult diaper sales? Depends.)
But perhaps this is much ado about nothing and it wont happen ” and itll end happily in the end.

   Apr. 8, 2010 (Zacks Investment Research delivered by Newstex) -- 
 News reports came out today that US Airways Group, Inc. () and UAL Corporation () were again in merger talks 
now that the recession has ended and the economy seems to be (slowly) recovering. 
?DART(15
);?
 As a result, these two companies occupy the top two spots on the Zacks #1 Rank Top Performers List today. The 
"winner" is LCC with a gain of approximately 10.7%, while UAUA secures the second spot with a gain of 6.75%. 
 It would be the understatement of the year (so far) to simply say that volume for these companies was up on the 
news. Volume for LCC has skyrocketed to more than 52 million shares, compared to the daily average of about 6 
million. Meanwhile, UAUA volume soared to more than 30 million shares, versus the usual 7.5 million. 
 Both companies are part of the transportation - airline industry, which is well-represented on the . Besides US 
Airways Group (NYSE:LCC)  and UAL Corporation, there are 5 other names from that space on the list: Alaska Air 
Group, Inc. (), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (), LAN Airlines S.A. (), Ryanair Holdings plc () and Southwest Airlines Company 
(). (By the way, ALK and DAL are also among the top 10 Top Performers today.) 
 The Deal
 According to the news reports, there's not much to say about the merger yet. The talks have just begun, so a deal 
could be some ways off. Of course, it's also possible that the talks break down all together. 
 An early read from analysts suggest that it might be seen as a positive for the space, since there will be fewer 
flights between a pair of companies that have some overlap in routes. 
US Airways Group
 LCC has put together 7 straight quarters of better-than-expected earnings. More specifically, it has only missed in 
one quarter out of the last 10. In its fourth quarter, the company lost 20 cents per share, which was narrower than 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate and marked a surprise of 60%. 
 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year and next is at $1.29 and $1.35 per share, respectively. Both of those 
outlooks have reversed loss estimates over the past 3 months while gaining approximately 14% and nearly 9% in 
30 days. 
US Airways Group (LCC) and UAL Corp (UAUA) - Zacks #1 Rank Top Performers
UAL Corporation
 The overall template for UAUA is similar to LCC, except with different specifics, which is understandable since 
they're both in the same industry and had to deal with the same challenges.
UAL Corporation also strung together 7 straight quarters with earnings surprises. Most recently, the company lost 
$1.05 per share in its fourth quarter, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, which it beat by more than 28%. 
 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year has gained 50% in 30 days to $1.89 per share. Meanwhile, next 
year's target of $2.70 is up nearly 70% in that time. Analysts were expecting losses for both periods three months 
ago.

 Apr. 8, 2010 (           Market News Video delivered by Newstex) -- 
News out of Greece dampened the mood of investors on Thursday morning as the Greek government continues to 
struggle with its debt.  And Verizon (NYSE:VZ)  (VZ) and Exelon (NYSE:EXC)  (EXC) announced they would be 
forced to take non-cash charges to earnings as a result of the new healthcare legislation passed last month.  With 
trouble brewing in Greece and the US healthcare legislation impacting earnings of even more companies, one 
would expect the markets to be lower this week.  But once again the markets have shown their resilience as the 
Nasdaq has gained 1.4%, the S&P 500 has gained 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average eeked out a gain of 
0.2% so far.
Investors were encouraged by the positive data from retailers this morning.  Overall, it looks like the early Easter 
has resulted in better-than-expected sales from a number of retailers.  Some of the more notable ones include 
Macy's (M) who posted a 10.8% increase in same-store sales in March, Nordstrom's (JWN) saw same-store sales 
increase by 16.8% and Limited Brands (NYSE:LTD)  (LTD) saw same-store sales increase by 15%.  With the US 
consumer regaining its appetite for spending, investors are hopeful that the economy will continue to grow at a 
strong pace this year.
Shares of the SPDR Retail ETF (XRT) have been on a tear since early February and have gained more than one 
percent this week, including today's modest gains.
And the airline sector has made some noise this week, both positive and negative.  Starting with the positive news, 
United Airlines (UAUA) and US Airways (NYSE:LCC)  (LCC) may consider merging.  A story broke late Wednesday 
that the two airlines may merge and could rival competitor Delta (NYSE:DAL)  (DAL) as the largest US airline.  
However, with the good news, comes the bad.  Travelers could be facing further fees when they want to travel.  
Spirit Airlines announced Tuesday it would begin charging for carry-on luggage, which would be in addition to its 
fees for checked luggage.  And not to be outdone, Ryanair, may begin to charge a toliet fee on shuttle flights in 
Sector Wrap: Retail, Airlines
Europe.  It seems that the airline industry will continue to see what fees it can assess passengers as means of 
boosting quarterly earnings.
Investors bid up shares of the Claymore Airlines ETF (FAA) following the news this week, gaining almost three 
percent so far today.

           An airport worker who helped two women lift the body of a dead relative from a taxi, before they tried to 
check him in for a flight, said he knew he was dead.  
Gitta Jarant and Anke Anusic tried to check in the body of Curt Willi Jarant for a flight to Berlin at Liverpool John 
Lennon Airport on Saturday.  
They said they thought the 91-year-old, who was wearing sunglasses and was in a wheelchair, was asleep.
 Andrew Millea said the man's face fell against his, and it was "ice cold". "I knew straight away that the man was 
dead, but they reassured me that he 'always sleeps like that'," he said.  
Well, theyre economical up in Oldham. It seems like a normal ticket costs less than space in freight. Its the Ryanair 
effect. 
Bodies, incidentally, arent ice cold: they assume ambient temperature, which must have been fairly high if Mr Jarant 
had been fermenting over the course of a 40 mile taxi ride. If he was cold “ and had been dead for 24 hours “ then 
he must have been put in some form of refrigeration. 
Personally Id rather travel with a corpse, assuming it isnt too ripe, than, say a peevish child. Or this chap.

1. TripAdvisor.com did an online poll Wednesday to ask people about Spirit Airlines' plans to charge for carry-on 
bags beginning Aug. 1.
Not surprisingly, the 1,750-plus respondents in the non-scientific poll didn't like the idea: 91 percent said they 
wouldn't pay a fee for a carry-on bag.
2. The American Association for Nude Recreation suggest that you don't pack any clothes to go on a trip.
"To avoid added baggage stress as you embark upon a vacation, whose purpose is to de-stress and rejuvenate 
you, plan a Nakation - a vacation to a nudist resort!" AANR executive director Erich Schuttauf said.
"All you'll need for the week (sunscreen, cap, sunglasses, shoes and toiletries) can fit in a small carry on that will fit 
under the seat, avoiding even carry on bag fees," he said.
3. The TravelMail area of the Daily Mail in England, reported Tuesday that Irish carrier Ryanair is moving ahead 
with its plan to put pay toilets on its Boeing (NYSE:BA)  aircraft.
TravelMail quotes Ryanair spokeman Stephen McNamara:
 "By charging for the toilets we are hoping to change passenger behaviour so that they use the bathroom before or 
after the flight. That will enable us to remove two out of three of the toilets and make way for at least six extra seats 
on board." 
Ryanair is looking a fee of a pound ($1.53) or euro ($1.34), whatever you have on you.

Spirit Airlines said Tuesday morning that it will charge for carry-on bags beginning Aug. 1. Here are some reactions.
Jami Counter, senior director of            TripAdvisor Flights:
 I think that this move by Spirit may cross the line for American travelers who are already near the breaking point 
due to rising checked baggage fees, and that other domestic carriers will be hard pressed to follow suit in the near-
term. It's interesting that the program will not kick in until August, perhaps giving Spirit time to cut the program if 
there's significant backlash from customers. 
In any case, it's going to take some time for air travelers to get accustomed to the idea of an airline charging for 
carry-on baggage. While there may be a big enough customer base out there willing to suffer a wide array of add-
on fees in exchange for rock bottom fares, it's likely that this move will alienate many fliers.
I'd expect other domestic carriers to sit back and watch to see how this move by Spirit plays out. If there's not a 
strong customer backlash, other carriers may be tempted to match the move given the challenging industry revenue 
environment. At the end of the day though, I do think this is a step too far for the traveling public and other carriers 
won't follow Spirit's lead on this.
Airfarewatchdog.com president George Hobica:
 The real question is, will other airlines follow, and will this actually be good for air travel? Planes will load faster if 
people don't bring carryons on board. The carryon fees are actually higher than checked bag fees now on Spirit, so 
apparently Spirit is trying to get people not to bring carryons. 
And the other question is when will more shoes drop? When will we finally see a US airline dare to charge for using 
a credit or debit card, and who will be the first to eliminate airport check-in counter staff, forcing passengers to show 
up at the airport with a pre-printed boarding pass and pre-paid luggage fees, then proceed to a conveyor belt, show 
We have some reactions to Spirit Airlines ' fee for carry-on bags
their fee payment, and drop their bags themselves on a conveyor belt - and proceed to the gate. No human 
interaction necessary.
Aubrey Cohen,            Aerospace News, Seattlepi.com:
 I actually think this makes sense, in that I agree with the idea of allowing people to pay for what they need and not 
pay for what they don't. (Although charging for bathrooms goes too far. Do you hear me, Ryanair?) 
Also, making it cheaper -- or at least the same price -- to check a bag will eliminate the extra time and hassle 
caused by people trying to fit their camping chests into already overstuffed overhead bins.
Rick Seaney, CEO of            FareCompare.com:
 Well, I predicted this was coming - and sadly, I was right. 
Tom Belden,            Winging Itblog, Phladelphia Inquirer:
 There is no charge yet for carrying on a cane or coat, or if you're wearing clothes when boarding (perhaps that will 
be next, since clothing adds to weight, which causes an airplane to burn more fuel, which increases an airline's 
costs, which otherwise might require an increase in ticket prices, which would be unfair to all those who choose to 
wear clothes while traveling, right?)  
Chris Elliott, ConsumerTraveler.com:
 [Chief financial officer Ken] McKenzie is suggesting that passengers asked for these changes. That's nonsense. I 
don't know of anyone who wanted to pay for a carry-on bag. What's worse, I hear echoes of this when I speak with 
people at the Transportation Department: You should only have to pay for what you use. 
How far can they take that line of reasoning? All the way to the pay toilets?
