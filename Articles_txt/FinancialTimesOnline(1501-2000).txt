European airlines' shares fell on Wednesday after Ryanair warned it could miss its full year profit target as it cuts 
fares in response to increasing competition and weakening demand for air travel.
Ryanair's shares closed down 11 per cent at EUR6 after the company said it expected its net profit for 2013-14 to 
come in at the lower end of its previous guidance of between EUR570m and EUR600m, partly because it was 
responding to rivals' ticket discounting.
Europe's largest budget airline by revenue warned there was a possibility it could generate "slightly" less than 
EUR570m if yields - a measure of average fares paid - continued to weaken over the winter.
Airlines' shares were hit - including those of Aer Lingus, Norwegian Air Shuttle, easyJet, Lufthansa, International 
Airlines Group and Air France-KLM - as investors weighed the possibility of a profit-sapping price war.
One reason why certain analysts believe there is a significant risk of a price war on routes within Europe is that 
some smaller carriers - such as Norwegian Air Shuttle and IAG's Vueling - have been increasing aircraft capacity 
significantly. Ryanair and easyJet have also placed large aircraft orders this year.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said he did not see a lot of capacity growth currently, adding he was 
surprised by how flight bookings had been "weak" during September and October.
He claimed several rivals had been lowering fares, adding: "We are going to respond aggressively with pricing and 
promotions in the next number of months . . . If that doesn't affect our competitors, then good for them. But I 
suspect, as has happened in the past, they will all be following us."
Ryanair warns it may miss profit target
Analysts had been expecting Ryanair to generate net profit of just under EUR650m in the year to March 2014, and 
one said the company's trading statement was disappointing partly because it had a history of outperforming its 
earnings guidance.
The company is responding to weaker yields partly by cutting aircraft capacity on certain routes during the winter, 
and expects to carry just under 81m passengers in 2013-14, compared with a previous target of more than 81.5m. 
Capacity reductions can give airlines the opportunity to raise fares.
Ryanair indicated late flight bookings in July had been at weaker than expected yields partly because the heatwave 
in northern Europe had prompted some people to stay at home rather than fly south.
While the situation improved in August, Mr O'Leary said the company had noticed a "perceptible dip in forward fares 
and yields into September, October and November" because of several factors.
These were increased price competition and some capacity increases in the UK, Scandinavian, Spanish and Irish 
markets; the continuing effect of austerity and weak economic conditions across Europe; and the negative impact of 
exchange rates involving sterling and the euro. About 25 per cent of Ryanair's sales originate in sterling.
Damian Brewer, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said of Ryanair's trading update: "Ryanair has historically 
delivered results well ahead of its own guidance so this is disappointing news."

Airline stocks were the poorest performers on pan-European indices after Ireland's Ryanair warned it was unlikely 
to meet its full-year profit goals.
The Dublin-listed low-cost carrier fell 13.4 per cent to EUR5.87 after it said austerity measures in Europe had 
crimped demand while currency weakness in Britain - its biggest market - had hit revenues.
"This surprise statement has rocked the sector," said Charlie Menegatos at Accendo Markets. "However, Ryanair 
has reiterated the strength of its balance sheet and added that there will be no change to its planned buybacks and 
dividends for 2014-15."
Peers were down heavily as the sector also remained fragile to geopolitical knocks from Syria, which has driven oil 
prices to six-month highs recently.
Germany's Lufthansa fell 2.9 per cent to EUR12.93 while rival budget group Norwegian Air Shuttle shed 6.4 per 
cent to NKr210.50.
Aer Lingus, the Irish airline in which Ryanair still holds a near 30 per cent stake, fell 5.8 per cent to EUR1.58.
Shares in SAS, the Swedish airline, jumped 10.5 per cent to SKr14.80 after reporting a profit in its third quarter and 
forecasting a positive full year.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 inched 0.2 per cent higher to 1,214.96.

The FTSE MIB index in Milan underperformed, falling 1.4 per cent to 16,712.2 on concerns that the party of Silvio 
Berlusconi will pull out of the coalition government if the former PM, recently convicted of tax fraud, is removed from 
the Senate.
Among the Italian stocks falling on the Eurofirst, UniCredit, the bank, lost 2.3 per cent to EUR4.30.
Among the winners, French aerospace and defence contractor Thales climbed 4.9 per cent to EUR39.29.
The company is a major supplier of cockpit electronics and guidance systems.
Dutch electronics group Philips added 2.7 per cent to EUR24.67 after Morgan Stanley raised its target price to 
EUR27 from EUR26.
K+S, the German potash producer, climbed 2.3 per cent to EUR19 on hopes that a new potash industry cartel will 
be formed between Uralkali and Belaruskali, whose split several weeks ago prompted concerns about a drop in 
prices for the fertiliser.

Worries about the health of the sugar market put AB Foods under pressure in a flat London market.
AB Foods slid 3.2 per cent to £18.41 after Credit Suisse forecast that the European Union's contract round for 2014 
would cut prices by up to 15 per cent.
Analysts expect Europe's sugar market to provide about a fifth of AB Foods' earnings this year with prices holding 
relatively steady until 2017 when the EU scraps national quotas limiting production.
However, sugar prices were already beginning to reflect the regime change as Brussels piled on the political 
pressure, said Credit Suisse.
It reckoned lower cost suppliers were already finding ways to jockey for market share in the UK, where AB Foods 
supplies about half the market.
AB Foods, which has a full-year trading upate due on Monday, has already warned earnings from sugar would fall 
in 2013.
Primark, its retail arm, was therefore likely to become the group's biggest contributor to group earnings this year, 
said Numis Securities.
Numis started coverage of AB Foods with a "hold" rating, calling the company "somewhat reminiscent of the old-
style UK conglomerates". It had a £20.82 break-up value on the stock.
AB Foods slides on sugar lows
The wider market rallied from an opening decline with the FTSE 100 ending up 6.33 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 
6,474.74.
Travel companies were the sharpest fallers after Ryanair warned that pricing had deteriorated in recent weeks as 
competition increased in its key markets.
Airlines have been this year's top-performing stocks as stable fuel prices and capacity withdrawal meant market 
expectations outpaced company guidance.
Ryanair's London-traded stock lost lost 11.2 per cent to EUR6.03 while Easyjet was down 5.1 per cent to £12.15.
British Airways owner IAG was down 1.3 per cent to 291p even after reporting continued growth in premium traffic 
for August and told analysts that it had seen no evidence of the weakness Ryanair had experienced.
Holiday companies also suffered after Ryanair's warning. Thomas Cook fell 4.8 per cent to 135.7p and Tui Travel 
was off 3.2 per cent to 334.6p as the latter stock traded ex a 3.75p dividend.
Ashtead dropped 5.3 per cent to 651p to profit-taking even after the US-focused plant hire group's first-quarter 
results beat consensus expectations.
JPMorgan Cazenove remained cautious, saying comparison periods get tougher for the remainder of the year and 
the shares were already at 17 times earnings, a premium to its biggest US competitor United Rentals.
Vodafone was up 2.2 per cent to 207p to lead the FTSE 100, having weakened sharply to profit-taking on Tuesday 
following confirmation that it was selling Verizon Wireless.
Deutsche Bank said investors may have misunderstood Vodafone's own guidance because its net debt guidance 
included the effects of its acquisition of Kabel Deutschland whereas its cash flow guidance did not.
The upshot was that Vodafone's post-deal businesses remained at a "substantial discount to peers", suggesting 
upside to around 240p, Deutsche said.
Talktalk climbed 1.9 per cent to 258.2p on reports that the internet provider might be a takeover target for 
Vodafone, though investors said Vodafone was highly unlikely to be looking at UK acquisitions following its 
purchase last year of C&W Worldwide.
A late burst of speculative demand among day traders lifted Imperial Tobacco 1.4 per cent to £21.84.
A day before results, Monitise climbed 16.8 per cent to a record high of 53.8p after Goldman Sachs tipped the cash 
transfer system developer as a likely takeover target.
Setting a 100p target price, it forecast Monitise to deliver annual revenue growth of 50 per cent over the next five 
years and reach cash flow breakeven by 2015.
"We believe new product launches and major customer and contract wins in the past 12 months lend significant 
credibility to its technology platform, which also increases its strategic appeal," said Goldman.
"It is no longer a concept stock and the market underestimates its potential to become a platform vendor 
encompassing the mobile banking, payments and mobile commerce segments."

"Where are you going?" "Nowhere." "I mean, where are you going on your next trip?" "I repeat, I'm not going 
anywhere."
At this point, a look almost of panic enters the interlocutor's eyes: what is the matter with this person?
In some circles, being constantly on the move has come to be seen not only as a badge of success, but as proof of 
membership of the human race. The stay-at-home person belongs to an inferior species.
The odd thing is that this has coincided with the dire transformation of travel - especially air travel - from something 
glamorous and exciting into a penance and a humiliation, governed by the philosophy of sadistic meanness brought 
to a fine art by Irish low-cost airline Ryanair.
Those on the status treadmill of constant travel are victims of a delusion, or are simply behind the times: this was 
the conclusion I came to in a discussion with a wise Spanish diplomat friend - "people think there is something 
wrong with you if you are not travelling," he said, "but you are the lucky one."
This applies especially to summers in London. A mass evacuation of the capital occurs around the middle of July, 
leaving the city's roads blessedly free of traffic (parents transporting kids a few hundred yards to school in troop 
carriers are nowhere to be seen - presumably they have decamped to Sardinia, or Kefalonia). The whole place is 
bathed in a serenity that otherwise can be experienced only for a few days around Christmas, or when there is a 
heavy snowfall.
In praise of staying put
Leaving London in late July and the first three weeks of August nowadays (this was not always the case) seems to 
me unnecessary. The weather is usually fine - we had a blazing July and are enjoying a lovely temperate August - 
and frankly far more pleasant than the unbearable heat of Andalucia or the burning, blowy Greek islands (better in 
May or September). The days are perfect for swimming in the Hampstead ponds (almost soupily warm this July) or 
in the Thames at Walton, bracing but not icy. This is the ideal time for picnics and even barbecues. The mildness of 
our climate means that it is hardly ever too hot for tennis - and the courts are empty - in fact rather too empty at our 
club - after the excitement of the July tournament.
You might think that everything grinds to a halt, culturally, in July and August. Certainly this is not the best time for 
theatre. But this is the Proms season in London, the time of the world's greatest and most democratic classical 
music festival. For almost two months you can pay just £5 to stand and stamp in the arena in proximity to some of 
the world's finest musicians, or to enjoy the different experience of chilling out in the gallery at the very top of the 
Royal Albert Hall, further removed from the action, and with peculiar acoustics.
I had the chance to enjoy two of our finest contemporary pianists (both London-based, as it happens): Stephen 
Hough displaying his refined, insouciant virtuosity in Rachmaninov and Lutoslawski on the first night, and Dame 
Mitsuko Uchida bringing her crystalline sound and spiritual depth to Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto, with the 
magnificent Mariss Jansons conducting the brilliant Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra.
Their performances could hardly have been more different but I reckon that it is as difficult to weight the chords as 
perfectly as Uchida did in the quiet, solo opening of the Beethoven as it is to bring off the fiendish cascades at the 
end of the Lutoslawski piece with Hough's sparkling panache. As for Jansons, he seems able to bring out a wider 
palette of sounds and colours from whichever orchestra he is conducting than any other contemporary conductor.
Even if you can't get to the Albert Hall, you can listen to the Proms on BBC Radio 3 in the comfort of your home or 
(if you have understanding neighbours) garden. Surely summer is the time to enjoy your home, not to abandon it. 
The other evening we sat out under the vine on two newly acquired fold-up garden chairs, at the rickety table I 
recently got around to repainting, sipping glasses of a venerable champagne, left forgotten in my father's cellar for 
decades, which had reached a perfect stage of golden richness.
Without thinking about it, we were following the advice of a poet who, 2,000 years ago, wrote of the pleasure of 
"drinking beneath the thick-leaved vine." That poet was Horace, patron of stay-at-homers - those who realise that 
"people who rush across oceans change only the colour of the sky, not their state of mind".
Horace was writing to a globe-trotting young friend, on a grand tour of the eastern Aegean and determined to visit 
every famous beauty spot. You can be sure that Horace himself had done all that as a young man; in middle age 
we know he still made the odd trip to the Bay of Naples. But on the whole he is happy to stay in his shady valley, 
where he has learnt to make friends with himself.

As the west teetered on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East, this time threatening air strikes on Syria, the 
oil price predictably crept higher. Any military action, however, may only have a small effect on the price with 
Libya's declining production more of a long-term worry. This comes at a time when nuclear plants are being shut 
across the US, the latest an Entergy-owned one in Vermont, in what could prove to be a short-sighted move if clean 
energy remains a worthy goal. Prices for another basic material, potash, are falling fast with the arrest of Uralkali's 
chief executive in Belarus dashing any hopes of the previous cartel being re-established.
Those not distracted by events in Syria had plenty of dealmaking to keep them busy. Vodafone confirmed it was in 
talks with Verizon about selling its 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless, but the US telecoms company may have 
to find $130bn to seal the deal. In the US, Amgen agreed the cash purchase of biotech company Onyx for $9.7bn 
as it searches for growth. Also in America, stock exchange operators BATS and Direct Edge combined forces in an 
attempt to give Nasdaq and NYSE a run for their money.
But any hopes Ryanair had of acquiring rival Irish airline Aer Lingus were dashed after the UK Competition 
Commission ordered the former to sell down its stake in the latter. In Asia, conglomerate Fraser and Neave was 
busy breaking itself up after 130 years in existence by spinning off its property portfolio. If activist investor Dan Loeb 
is hoping to shake up the cosy auction house duopoly after raising his stake in Sotheby's, he has his work cut out.
Finally in financial services, JPMorgan had yet another fine hanging over it - this time for mortgage bonds sold to 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that allegedly included faulty loans - but the US bank can easily afford what could be 
a $6bn bill. Its reputation is another matter. In Switzerland, the chairman of Zurich Insurance, Josef Ackermann, 
stepped down after the apparent suicide of the company's CFO, leaving investors wondering exactly what was 
happening behind the scenes.

UK regulators have ordered Ryanair to sell down its 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus to 5 per cent in a keenly 
anticipated ruling that the low-cost carrier vowed to appeal.
The budget airline will also be restricted from seeking or accepting board representation or acquiring further shares 
in Aer Lingus to protect competition on UK-Ireland routes.
The UK Competition Commission said in a ruling on Wednesday that Ryanair's minority stake in its rival "had led or 
may be expected to lead to a substantial lessening of competition between the airlines on routes between Great 
Britain and Ireland".
It added: "Aer Lingus's commercial policy and strategy was likely to be affected by Ryanair's minority shareholding, 
in particular because it was likely to impede or prevent Aer Lingus from being acquired by, or combining with 
another airline."
Ryanair accused the commission of making a "manifestly unjust ruling". Ryanair's share price dipped 0.92 per cent 
to EUR6.46 by mid afternoon.
The decision marks the latest blow delivered by regulators to Ryanair's attempt to control Aer Lingus, with which it 
competes in the Irish market. In February, Brussels blocked Ryanair's third bid in eight years to take over Aer 
Lingus, ruling that the proposed transaction would increase fares for passengers and create a monopoly on 46 UK-
Ireland routes.
Ryanair told to cut Aer Lingus stake
Simon Polito, deputy chairman of the commission, said there was a tension between Ryanair's position as a 
competitor and its position as Aer Lingus's largest shareholder.
"Ryanair has an incentive to weaken its rival's effectiveness as a competitor," he said. "Ryanair's minority 
shareholding affects Aer Lingus's commercial policy and strategy in various ways that could be crucial to Aer 
Lingus's future as a competitive airline.
"We were particularly concerned about Ryanair's ability, either directly or indirectly, to impede Aer Lingus from 
combining with another airline to build scale and achieve synergies to remain competitive."
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said the commission's ruling was "bizarre and manifestly wrong".
"This prejudicial approach to an Irish airline is very disturbing, coming from an English government body that 
regards itself a model competition authority," he said.
Ryanair said the UK ruling failed to accept the findings of a European Commission ruling issued in February 2013, 
which it claimed found that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus had intensified since 2007. The 
commission's failure to accept this finding would be the basis of its appeal, said the airline.
Aer Lingus welcomed the decision. Colm Barrington, chairman of Aer Lingus, said: "It was unacceptable that our 
principal competitor was allowed to remain on our share register with a shareholding of 29.82 per cent and interfere 
with our business."
Ryanair will have to bring its appeal before the Competition Appeals Tribunal within four weeks. The airline can ask 
the tribunal to suspend the commission's decision during the appeals process, which could take up to six months.
Analysts pointed out that if Ryanair pursued further appeals the process could take years. Moreover, Mr O'Leary 
has not ruled launching a fourth bid for Aer Lingus, which could delay a resolution even further.
"It is one of the options that remains open to us," he told the Financial Times in an interview. "My understanding is 
that if we launch a fourth bid that it would reset everything back to zero."

the tribunal to suspend the commission's decision during the appeals process, which could take up to six months.
David Went, partner at law firm Sidley Austin, said: "If unsuccessful before the tribunal, further appeals potentially 
lie to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court . . . The commission's decision is therefore by no means the end 
of this lengthy saga."

Consolidation is a fact of life in the airline industry. Scale provides carriers with cost and revenue synergies. This is 
one point on which low-cost carrier Ryanair and smaller Irish rival Aer Lingus agree. So is it right that the former, 
with a near-30 per cent stake in the latter yet barred from acquiring Aer Lingus for clear antitrust reasons, should be 
allowed to hinder its rival's chances of participating in this trend?
That, in a nutshell, is what Wednesday's ruling by the UK Competition Commission comes down to. Aer Lingus is 
not an ailing carrier: it made EUR70m profit on EUR1.4bn of revenue last year, and has a healthy cash balance. 
But, as the airline admits, its unit costs will rise over time, eroding competitiveness. By contrast, in the right 
corporate combination, it might enjoy significant savings: the CC puts a tentative net present value of EUR60m-
EUR100m on possible cost synergies on its Great Britain/Ireland routes.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, of course, contends that his stake blocks nothing and has offered to sell it to any Aer 
Lingus bidder who tops a 50 per cent stake. But a babe in arms knows corporate relationships can be more 
nuanced than full ownership, particularly in sensitive sectors like aviation. And it is easy to see why the brash low-
cost carrier's presence could, in effect, be a poison pill.
Ryanair will appeal the imposed sell-down to 5 per cent. But the CC has said that this remedy does not need to 
await the outcome of a separate legal challenge over the bar on a Ryanair merger in Luxembourg. So its appeals 
may be limited to the English courts. That means a seven-year saga could end in months. Meantime, use of a 
minority stake to frustrate corporate strategy may have been highlighted at a time when EU antitrust regulators are 
reviewing their powers in this area. In that respect, at least, Mr O'Leary may have done everyone a favour.

Earnings from two of France's blue-chip stocks were responsible for the best and one of the worst performances on 
pan-European stock indices.
Shares in Accor, Europe's largest hotel group, fell 4.4 per cent to EUR27.52 after the company warned on full-year 
profit after reporting weaker than expected first-half results.
The owner of the Novotel and Ibis chains said operating profit in its first six months fell 6.4 per cent to EUR198m 
and forecast full-year profit to come in at between EUR510m-EUR530m, just below market estimates of EUR535m.
"Even with significant help from the cost savings programme, Accor still expects full-year core earnings to be below 
last year," said Geof Collyer at Deutsche Bank.
At the other end of the FTSE Eurofirst 300 stood Bouygues, the conglomerate, up 10.5 per cent to EUR25.33 after 
it maintained its profit outlook following a 10 per cent rise in second-quarter operating profit to EUR432m, beating 
expectations.
Overall, however, market sentiment remained clouded by the sell-off in emerging markets and the Syrian crisis. The 
Eurofirst 300 fell 0.3 per cent to 1,198.56.
Among the top gainers, oil groups were prominent as the threat of international involvement in Syria drove up oil 
prices.
Accor slips after earnings warning
Spanish oil producer Repsol added 3.2 per cent to EUR18.11 while Norway's Statoil gained 4.2 per cent to 
NKr137.60.
Oilfield services groups were also strong after forecast-beating results from Oslo-listed Seadrill, which climbed 2.9 
per cent to NKr273.50. Italian rival Saipem gained 2.4 per cent to EUR16.58.
The sharp rise in oil prices over past couple of sessions hit shares in the region's airlines. Lufthansa fell 3.2 per cent 
to EUR13.49 and Air France-KLM lost 3 per cent to EUR5.74.
Ryanair fell 0.1 per cent to EUR6.51 after the UK Competition Commission ordered the Dublin-based airline to cut 
its holding in rival Aer Lingus from nearly 30 per cent to no more than 5 per cent.
Utilities were broadly higher as gains took on a more defensive feel. France's GDF Suez rose 2.2 per cent to 
EUR16.60 after Credit Suisse raised its rating to outperform from neutral.

Are entrepreneurs freaks of nature? Jim Clifton thinks so. He is the boss of research firm Gallup, and recently wrote 
about studies it is undertaking to find those especially talented individuals who can build the next Google, Ryanair 
or Bloomberg.
Gallup estimated that such "super-entrepreneurs" number just three out of 1,000 across a sample population. 
These are the risk-takers capable of founding so-called gazelle companies: the fastest-growing breakthrough 
organisations that create a high proportion of the new jobs and genuine innovation in an economy.
Identifying these prime movers is incredibly difficult. It is not like spotting brilliant footballers or pianists, where there 
are exams, courses, teachers and systems to discover and cultivate rare prowess. However, the skills displayed by 
the next Steve Jobs or Sir James Dyson are more complex and less well understood. They involve an ability to 
organise and promote a business, make a commercial idea concrete, hire and lead a team, generate sales and add 
value. There can be no academic qualification for attributes such as inventiveness or a spirit of enterprise.
It is a tragedy that the economics profession almost ignores this subject, and that business schools have done so 
little useful work to identify key character traits of the vital few. Venture capitalists would have much to gain by 
undertaking serious scientific studies into the personalities of winners in business. But they seem resigned to the 
idea that there are few rules or systems for finding the right ones to back.
Scott Shane, a prolific writer on entrepreneurship, postulates that genetic factors are powerful determinants of 
whether someone will develop a successful business. His book Born Entrepreneurs, Born Leaders  suggests 
innate, inheritable predispositions really matter.
The small start-ups are as vital as the stars
A survey of entrepreneurs at Northeastern University supports his view: 61 per cent of respondents said innate 
drive was the main reason they started a business: only 1 per cent said their higher education was a significant 
factor.
Not everyone buys the idea that a small number of extraordinary risk-takers are the ones who make a difference, 
however. Mass Flourishing , an important new book by Nobel prizewinner Edmund Phelps, suggests individuals 
matter much less than overall culture and social values. The subtitle of his text is "How grassroots innovation 
created jobs, challenge, and change". His thesis is that most industrial discoveries were not pioneered by a few 
isolated visionaries, such as Henry Ford. Instead, he argues that progress was driven by huge numbers of citizens 
empowered to create and sell thousands of incremental improvements, from craftsmen and farmers to traders and 
factory workers. Together they generated an extraordinary period of prosperity, starting in the 1820s in Britain and 
petering out in the 1970s in the US.
Now, in the west, Professor Phelps believes there is a sense that the "glorious history of desire and dreams" has 
run out of steam. Unquestionably, there is an unholy alliance of conservatism and socialism that impedes economic 
and technological advances by resisting innovation.
In Britain, for instance, whether it is fracking, immigration, reforming the state or genetically modified foods, we 
suffer from neurotic environmentalists and Nimby elements who object to change and are deaf to rational 
arguments. They defy modernity, and seek to embrace what they imagine are "traditional" values. So they resent 
wealth creation, cling to bloated welfare and pension systems, resist new developments and so forth. By contrast, 
Prof Phelps shows how in the 19th and 20th centuries Britain and the US, among other nations, were dynamic and 
open to novelty - and that the good life was surprisingly inclusive then.
I agree with him that all entrepreneurship is important, not just the famous names. I also think that government, 
industry, regulators and institutions must be more venturesome if a nation is to compete successfully in a global 
marketplace. Meanwhile, educators, mentors, universities and philanthropists should explore much more deeply 
why certain entrepreneurs have such an impact, how to breed more of them, and how to encourage surroundings 
that will enable them to flourish.

British Airways owner IAG, this year's top-performing FTSE 100 stock, led the London market lower as rising fuel 
costs led investors to book profits.
IAG lost 4.8 per cent to 300.5p as the threat of a US-led military intervention against Syria lifted jet fuel prices to a 
six-month high.
ICE European gas oil futures, a benchmark for jet fuel, have jumped by about 17 per cent since mid-April.
"While jet fuel pricing has stabilised somewhat after a seemingly unstoppable rise between 2009 and 2011, the 
recent rise in jet fuel prices [ . . .] are still cause for concern and a severe headwind to airlines' profitability," said 
Investec Securities.
Cutting IAG off its "buy" list, Investec was also concerned that industry supply would outstrip demand.
Airlines had benefited from capacity discipline this year but recent aircraft orders by British Airways, Ryanair and 
easyJet imply a return to growth in 2014, moving towards long-term industry expansion of 3 per cent annually, the 
broker said.
"This could place pressure on yields unless underlying market expansion and/or further airline failures drive more 
supportive market supply conditions," Investec said. With IAG up 63 per cent so far this year, and pressure growing 
on both premium and short-haul yields, the chances of further outperformance were limited, said the broker.
It favoured easyJet, down 2.5 per cent to £12.34, and Ryanair, off 3.6 per cent to EUR6.52.
British Airways owner hit by jet fuel climb
Travel stocks led the wider market lower, leading the FTSE 100 down 0.8 per cent, or 51.13 points, to 6,440.97.
Tui Travel fell 3.8 per cent to 343.9p and Thomas Cook lost 8.5 per cent to 136.1p, while cruise operator Carnival 
was down 1.1 per cent to £24.83.
Precious metals miners helped counterbalance the FTSE as Syrian tensions pushed gold to its highest since June, 
with Fresnillo up 7.1 per cent to £13.10 and Randgold Resources firmer by 4.1 per cent to £53.35.
But Polymetal dropped 8.5 per cent to 741p a day before interim results, which were expected to show rising costs 
and a sharp fall in earnings on lower prices.
Among the gainers, Petrofac  rallied 8.5 per cent to £13.73 after its interim results beat expectations and came with 
an unexpectedly positive outlook.
Marks and Spencer took on 1.6 per cent to 479.1p after Citigroup turned positive.
Four years of investment in M&S's general merchandise IT and supply chain systems will pay off next year, 
delivering like-for-like sales growth after eight quarters of declines, said Citi.
"The combination of recent, material upgrades to UK economic growth forecasts and M&S management initiatives 
have markedly improved the credibility of double-digit 2015 and 2016 EPS growth forecasts," Citi said.
Fellow retailer Next advanced 1.5 per cent to £49.90 on an upgrade to "buy" from Merrill Lynch, which put a £55 
price target on the stock.
"Next is a consensus hold on the sellside despite having a lower valuation and higher earnings growth than the 
sector average," said Merrill.
"We expect Next to benefit from its counter-cyclical expansion in homewares during the downturn, given a likely 
continued improvement in UK housing activity and as we believe planning constraints are easing."
Premier Foods was up 9.5 per cent to 135.8p after Credit Suisse upgraded to "outperform" with a 155p target.
With the Hovis and Bisto owner stabilised, Premier could raise between £250m and 300m with a rights issue, said 
analyst Charlie Mills
"Valuing a business that is structurally over-indebted where profit expectations are falling is nigh on impossible - a 
deteriorating profit outlook simply crushes the equity value," he said.
"However if the profits have stabilised and can even show some growth, then the reverse is true - the equity 
leverage into a profit upturn is material.  Based on the current capital structure, we estimate a 10 per cent increase 
in the ebitda could translate into a 55 per cent increase in the equity."

Byline: Jamie Smyth in Dublin

In a dingy tenement building in Dublin, a worker washes blood off his face after a clash with police at a trade union 
picket line.
"They kept hitting him till the blood ran from his head," he cries out to his impoverished family after witnessing his 
friend being beaten to death.
This is not a sudden outburst of civil disorder in Ireland. It is a scene from Living the Lockout, a play 
commemorating the centenary of the worst industrial dispute in Irish history. The Dublin 1913 lockout saw 20,000 
workers battle employers for five months over the right of trade union recognition. They eventually returned to work 
without their key demand being met.
A century later Irish unions are once again fighting for the right to negotiate on behalf of workers in a bitter 
campaign that pits them against employers and threatens to divide the ruling Fine Gael/Labour party coalition.
"Ireland is almost unique in Europe in not recognising collective bargaining rights," says Shay Cody, general 
secretary of Impact, Ireland's second biggest trade union.
"This enables employers like Intel and Ryanair to take the same approach to workers' freedom of association today 
as employers did during the lock out."
Dublin has been praised by its eurozone partners for maintaining social cohesion and industrial peace while 
implementing cuts and tax rises worth EUR28.5bn since its financial crisis struck in 2008. It recently agreed a deal 
with trade unions in the public sector, which aims to cut pay and introduce new work practices.
Irish unions battle for right to negotiate on Dublin Lockout anniversary
Under Irish law, workers are free to join unions but employers do not have to negotiate with them. This legal point 
was confirmed in 2007 when Irish airline Ryanair won a landmark case at the Irish Supreme Court, defending its 
right to be a non-unionised company.
Unions are pressing the government to legislate for collective bargaining before the end of 2013. They argue 
European case law and the charter of fundamental rights -  which was recently enshrined into European Union 
treaties - means Ireland is in breach of EU law.
"Freedom of association is meaningless unless there is some element of collective bargaining," says David Begg, 
general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions - an umbrella group representing unions. "If the 
government fails to act a legal challenge is the logical end game."
Unions are emboldened by a 2008 judgment by a European Court of Human Rights judgment in Demir and Baykara 
v Turkey. They claim this ruling by the Strasbourg court concluded the European Convention on Human Rights 
upholds the right to collective bargaining.
Employers disagree. They say Irish labour law provides the necessary rights and protection for employees and any 
meddling with the voluntary system of industrial relations currently in place could cost jobs.
"The flexibility of the Irish labour system is a distinct competitive advantage and a key reason why so many foreign 
companies choose to locate here," says Danny McCoy, chief executive of employers group Ibec.
US multinationals based in Ireland, which directly employ 115,000 people, are at the forefront of lobbying efforts 
against any changes to the voluntary system of union recognition. The American Chamber of Commerce of Ireland 
says changing the system would "damage the capacity to attract and retain inward investment" in Ireland.
Dublin has pledged to address the issue to "ensure compliance by the state with recent judgments of the ECHR". 
But there are signs of mounting tension between the centre right Fine Gael party and the centre left Labour party, 
which has links with trade unions.
Richard Bruton, Ireland's minister for enterprise, told the Small Firms Association conference in June that any new 
system of collective bargaining introduced by the government would remain voluntary.
He is due to publish a report on the issue shortly and many of his Fine Gael colleagues remain opposed to 
mandatory collective bargaining.
"I think it would be a mistake. The last thing we want is to make changes that threaten employment," says Eoghan 
Murphy, a Fine Gael member of parliament (TD).
But as events commemorating the 1913 lockout begin in earnest this week in Dublin, the campaign to win union 
recognition is intensifying. Last month Siptu, Ireland's biggest union, accused Fine Gael of working with employers 
to once again stymie collective bargaining.
There are signs Labour is losing its patience on the issue.
"On the 100th anniversary of the Lockout, we have to deliver on the commitment in the programme for 
government," says Kevin Humphreys, a Labour TD and convener of the parliament's finance committee.
"Reckless bank lending, poor regulation and corporate greed are why the Irish economy collapsed, not trade 
unions. Stronger worker rights will benefit the entire economy, by improving domestic confidence and ensuring 
better working conditions," he said.

Italy's FTSE MIB underperformed the broader pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 on Monday after renewed political 
uncertainty hit the country's share market.
The implications of Silvio Berlusconi's conviction for tax fraud and his political party's response have sparked fears 
of a period of political uncertainty that could threaten the ruling coalition. Italian government debt prices have fallen 
in response, pushing yields higher on the 10-year bonds by 1.1 basis points to 4.33 per cent.
The FTSE Eurofirst ended flat at 1,223.52, while the FTSE MIB index fell 2.1 per cent to 16,977.76. Shares in the 
former prime minister's business empire were among those worst hit.
Mediaset, the Berlusconi-controlled broadcaster, publisher and advertising group, fell 6.3 per cent to EUR3.15.
Banks were also sharply lower, with UniCredit down 3.5 per cent to EUR4.42 and Intesa Sanpaolo off 3.3 per cent 
to EUR1.51.
Shares in KPN gained 3 per cent to EUR2.33 after América Móvil, which owns 30 per cent in the Dutch telecoms 
group, gave its backing to the sale of KPN's German unit E-Plus to Telefónica Deutschland.
Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire who owns América Móvil, gave an "irrevocable commitment" to vote in favour of 
the sale after Telefónica sweetened its bid to EUR8.55bn, from its initial EUR8.1bn offer.
Ryanair, the Irish budget airline, eased 0.8 per cent to EUR6.71 in Dublin after regulatory authorities in the UK said 
they were considering the company's stake in Irish rival Aer Lingus Group.
Italian stocks hit by fears of political uncertainty
The Competition Commission may force Ryanair to sell all, or part of its 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus after it 
said earlier in the year the market for flights between Ireland and the UK was distorted because of the holding.
Shares in French drugmaker Sanofi were helped by the results of a clinical trial that showed its Fluzone High-Dose 
vaccine was more effective at treating influenza in elderly patients than its standard dose Fluzone treatment. 
Shares in Sanofi were up 2.3 per cent to EUR76.65.

Direct transatlantic flights will be offered from regional airports in the north of the UK for the first time next spring, in 
a test of interest that could lead to the provision of regular services.
Flights to New York, Boston and Toronto main airports will be provided from Newcastle, Leeds Bradford and 
Glasgow airports in April by Jet2, which focuses on providing low-fare flights to leisure passengers flying from the 
Midlands and farther north.
The airline said it would trial a handful of flights from the three airports in response to demand, and if successful, 
would introduce the services permanently to its schedule and consider more destinations.
In November, the airline ran flights to New York from regional airports to gauge passenger interest, which it said 
had attracted great demand and been booked up.
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair has said for years that it wants to provide cheap transatlantic flights, which would be 
provided by a subsidiary, although it has no immediate plans to do so.
"Regional airports, unlike Heathrow and Gatwick, don't have direct connections to these places," said Steve Heapy, 
Jet2 chief executive.
"People don't always want to travel via Schiphol or Charles de Gaulle - we want to give people from the regions the 
chance to fly direct."
US flights to run from regional UK airports
Mr Heapy said the airline would remain focused on the north of the UK. "We concentrate on the northern markets, 
we're run by northern people and we understand it because we all live here," he said.

From Mr Paul Tweed.
Sir, I write on behalf of my client Ryanair to set the record straight in relation to your article headlined "Ryanair pilots 
raise safety concerns" (FT.com August 11).
The Pilot Group referred to in your article is controlled by an interim council comprised of KLM, Aer Lingus, 
Southwest and Air France pilots and trade union leaders. These individuals work not for Ryanair but for their 
competitor airlines, and so they are not representative of Ryanair's over 3,000 pilots. Indeed, their press releases 
confirm that they are a PR front for pilot unions of Ryanair's competitor airlines.
Ryanair has an industry-leading 29-year safety record, complies with all European and national legislation, and the 
independent Irish Aviation Authority (which is subject to rigorous oversight by the European Aviation Safety Agency 
and the International Civil Aviation Organisation) has recently confirmed that Ryanair's safety is "on a par with the 
safest airlines in Europe".

Italian banks led on pan-European bourses as yields on the country's government debt fell.
Italy's 10-year yield dropped 3.9 basis points to 4.24 per cent on Friday, taking its premium over the equivalent 
benchmark German Bund to its lowest in two years.
Italian banks are big holders of domestic bonds and the ever-diminishing likelihood of default attracted investors to 
the sector.
Intesa Sanpaolo climbed 6.4 per cent to EUR1.60 on Friday and was one of the best performers over the week, 
climbing 7.4 per cent. UniCredit climbed 1.7 per cent to EUR4.78 on Friday and was up 3.9 per cent over the week.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 climbed 0.3 per cent to 1,231.43 on Friday, giving it a weekly gain of 0.2 per cent.
Airlines were among the biggest fallers over the week. Lufthansa, the German carrier, fell 4.2 per cent to EUR14.20 
after it was downgraded by Morgan Stanley.
Smaller rival Air Berlin shed 1.5 per cent to EUR1.97 after it warned on annual profits.
Ryanair fell 7.8 per cent to EUR6.64 after pilots employed by the Irish budget airline called for an inquiry into 
employment practices and their impact on safety.
Among the best gainers this week was Subsea 7, the oilfield services group, which climbed 7.1 per cent to 
NKr121.30 over the five sessions after it reported record orders and forecast strong future profits.
Italian banks shine as borrowing costs fall
Subsea's optimism helped buoy a sector that has had little reason for cheer in recent weeks.
Italy's Saipem, which just over two weeks ago reported a second-quarter loss following two previous profit 
warnings, gained 5.6 per cent to EUR16.90 this week while France's Technip added 4 per cent to EUR86.85.

Standard Life  was under pressure yesterday on fears that its flagship fund was becoming unwieldy.
The life insurer is too reliant on its £17bn Global Absolute Return Strategies fund, which is "becoming a victim of its 
own success", Barclays argued. Strong performances in 2009 and 2010 have powered inflows but investment gains 
since then have been tougher to achieve, with June of this year its second-worst month on record, the broker noted.
The resignation last month of Euan Munro, architect of the GARS fund, would also encourage investors to pull cash 
out, argued Barclays. Mr Monro's exit led Hargreaves Lansdown to remove GARS from its influential Wealth 150 list 
of recommended funds.
Schroders' flagship UK Alpha fund suffered the same fate last year when portfolio manager Richard Buxton 
resigned. In the following three months the fund bled 40 per cent of its assets under management, Barclays said.
Standard Life Investments provides 16 per cent of group operating profit yet the shares trade on par with asset 
managers at 14 times 2014 earnings, rather than the rating of 11 times earnings given to life insurers, said 
Barclays.
"In reality, it is a life insurer with an average asset manager," the broker argued. It put a 311.5p target on Standard 
Life shares, which slid 0.9 per cent to 346.2p.
The wider market edged higher, with the FTSE 100 recovering from a five-week low to add 16.65 points or 0.3 per 
cent to 6,499.99. For the week the index was down 1.3 per cent, its biggest weekly decline since June.
Standard Life slips on GARS fund concerns
Travel stocks were among Friday's fallers after both Thomas Cook and Tui cancelled trips to Egyptian resorts from 
Germany. Tui Travel lost 0.9 per cent to 359.4p and Ryanair was down 1.5 per cent to EUR6.62.
UBS cut Thomas Cook, up 0.2 per cent to 146.3p, from its preferred list of travel stocks. While Egypt only 
accounted for between 5 per cent and 7 per cent of its programme and the financial impact for the year will be 
minimal, the high-profile press coverage was likely to keep the stock under pressure, it said.
Housebuilders broke a five-day losing streak ahead of results next week from Persimmon, the month's worst blue-
chip performer. Its shares bounced 8.3 per cent to £11.88 while Bovis Homes was ahead 7.6 per cent to 778.5p, 
Bellway added 6.5 per cent to £14.25 and Taylor Wimpey took on 6.5 per cent to 108.3p.
Balfour Beatty advanced 8.7 per cent to 245.7p after an upgrade from "sell" to "buy" from Liberum Capital.
Investors should write off an "awful" 2013 as irrelevant as the disposals and corrective measures taken will 
significantly improve prospects for 2014, Liberum argued. "Analysts have capitulated just when discontinueds and 
kitchen sinking make future profits more achievable," the broker said. "The shares offer some of the best margin 
recovery potential in the sector, and exposure to the early cycle US."
Miners followed metal prices higher, with copper at a 10-week high and gold heading for its biggest weekly gain in a 
month. Randgold Resources added 5.3 per cent to £51.50 and Polymetal took on 9 per cent to 783.5p, while 
Glencore rose 2.2 per cent to 308.4p.
A Merrill Lynch upgrade to "buy" lifted ITV 2.2 per cent to 160p. Strong UK retail sales data and an improving 
housing market suggest the risk to advertising is on the upside for 2014, it said.
Anite faded 6.9 per cent to 117p after the handset testing software maker repeated full-year guidance having made 
a relatively slow start to the year.
Frank Timis's African Minerals, the Sierra Leone iron ore miner, lost 2.9 per cent to 202p after Barclays advised 
selling. The unexpected exit this week of African's chief executive has added to uncertainties about the delivery of 
expansion plans, it said.
RSM Tenon  dropped 56.4 per cent to 1.9p after the highly indebted accountancy practice warned shareholders that 
its takeover talks would probably leave them with nothing.

International Airlines Group on Wednesday highlighted an aggressive expansion plan for Vueling, its new budget 
airline, by announcing a $5.4bn order with Airbus for 62 narrow-body passenger jets.
IAG, parent of British Airways and Iberia, also outlined options to buy up to 58 more narrow-body aircraft for 
Vueling, as it seeks to provide strong competition for low-cost carriers led by Ryanair and easyJet.
These low-cost carriers have expanded their short-haul operations at the expense of European flag carriers 
including BA, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa - putting lossmaking Iberia under particular pressure.
Barcelona-based Vueling, which IAG secured control of in April, could therefore provide the parent group with a 
more competitive position in European short-haul operations - and a significant source of earnings growth.
The 62 aircraft that Vueling is due to start receiving from Airbus in 2015 consist of 30 A320 Ceo, the European 
manufacturer's current narrow-body aircraft, and 32 A320 Neo - the next-generation model featuring more fuel-
efficient engines.
Some of these 62 will replace existing Vueling aircraft, but others will be used to expand the budget airline's all-
Airbus, 70-strong fleet.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said: "Vueling has managed to successfully expand its business profitably by 
targeting both growth markets and those areas where weak competitors are reducing capacity.
IAG places £5.4bn order with Airbus for Vueling expansion
"These new aircraft will enable Vueling to continue that expansion and replace some of its older fleet with modern, 
fuel-efficient aircraft, leading to further unit cost reductions."
Mr Walsh said at IAG's second-quarter results earlier this month that Alex Cruz, Vueling's chief executive, had a 
"free hand to compete aggressively with every one of our competitors".
The order for Vueling's 62 aircraft with Airbus, which must be approved by IAG's shareholders, is worth $5.4bn at 
catalogue prices - but airlines typically secure a discount. IAG said it had secured a "very substantial discount".
IAG has separately agreed options with Airbus to buy up to 100 A320 Neo aircraft that could go to BA, Iberia or the 
budget airline. It means IAG has put in place arrangements to purchase up to 220 narrow-body jets from Airbus.
Last month, BA began renewing its ageing long-haul fleet by taking delivery of its first Airbus A380 superjumbo.
BA is due to receive 78 wide-body jets over the next decade - 12 A380s and 18 A350s from Airbus, plus 42 
Dreamliners and six 777-300ERs from Boeing - worth $21.1bn at catalogue prices.

Ryanair fell to the foot of a flat FTSE Eurofirst after pilots at the Dublin-listed budget airline called for an inquiry into 
employment practices and their impact on safety.
Shares in the Irish carrier fell 3.8 per cent to EUR6.93 after the Ryanair Pilot Group, an unofficial body seeking 
union representation, conducted a private survey of pilots and first officers and found that nine-tenths of those 
polled had issues over the company's employment conditions and wanted regulators to investigate.
Rival airlines were mostly lower with German flag carrier Lufthansa down 1 per cent to EUR14.69 and Air France-
KLM down 1.2 per cent to EUR6.53.
But Air Berlin, the German no-frills operator, gained 6.9 per cent to EUR2.14.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended the session marginally higher at 1,230.03.
With few companies reporting earnings, much of the focus fell on the broker recommendations on companies that 
had recently issued results.
Deutsche Bank raised its rating on ING to buy from hold, favouring the Dutch financial services group because it 
was becoming "closer to being just a bank" given the divestments in its insurance business under its recent 
restructuring.
This means it would be in a better position to repay state aid sooner.
Ryanair slips as pilots call for inquiry
Analyst David Lock also raised ING's target price to EUR10 from EUR7.70. He said: "Removing state aid brings 
forward the potential for restarting dividends earlier."
Shares in ING gained 1.5 per cent to EUR8.71.
Solvay, the Belgian specialty chemicals company, was - in turn - upgraded by ING analysts.
Its stock was raised to buy from hold and its target price was lifted to EUR120 from EUR110. Its shares gained 2.5 
per cent to EUR108.15.
BASF and Lanxess, Solvay's German rivals, climbed 2 per cent to EUR66.11 and 2.7 per cent to EUR46.76, 
respectively.
German mid-cap industrial services group Bilfinger, which manages plants for BASF, rose 3.1 per cent to 
EUR74.30 after its 2 per cent fall in adjusted second-quarter operating profit was not as bad as feared.
Telekom Austria was one of only a small handful of other companies reporting and its shares lost 1.7 per cent to 
EUR5.63 after a 10 per cent fall in core earnings.

A survey of Ryanair pilots has found concerns about the low-cost carrier's safety culture, and support for an inquiry 
by regulators.
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline by revenue, declined to comment on the survey on Sunday, but said it had 
an "unblemished 29-year safety record".
The survey was commissioned by the Ryanair Pilot Group, which is seeking to have the airline's pilots represented 
by trade unions in negotiations on pay and working conditions.
It contacted more than 1,000 captains and first officers at Ryanair - more than one-third of the total number of pilots 
at the company.
The survey was prompted by a warning in April by Ray Conway, Ryanair's chief pilot and a senior manager, that 
any pilot signing a petition - organised by the Ryanair Pilot Group and calling on regulators to evaluate whether the 
company's employment model had an impact on the safety of flight operations - would be liable for dismissal.
Of those participating in the survey, 89 per cent said that, following this memorandum from Mr Conway, they did not 
consider that Ryanair had an open and transparent safety culture.
Mr Conway said in his memo that any pilot who had legitimate safety concerns should raise them through Ryanair's 
confidential safety reporting channel or with the Irish Aviation Authority.
Ryanair pilots raise safety concerns
The survey found that 67 per cent did not feel comfortable raising safety issues through Ryanair's internal reporting 
system.
It also found 94 per cent believed regulators should conduct an inquiry into the impact of Ryanair's employment 
practices on safety.
Evert van Zwol, chairman of the Ryanair Pilot Group's interim council, said it had a "strong suspicion" that the 
airline's employment practices may be affecting flight safety, but had no proof, which explained why an inquiry was 
warranted by regulators.
He added a majority of Ryanair's pilots were not employed directly but instead hired through agencies, and 
expressed concerns about their terms and conditions, saying many have so-called zero-hours contracts where 
there are no guaranteed working hours.
"The results of the survey are reason for very great concern and call for immediate action [by] all involved parties, to 
get working on a solution and lowering these [survey] percentages sharply down," said Mr van Zwol.
Ryanair said it would not comment on the Ryanair Pilot Group or its survey, which is due to be outlined in a 
Channel 4 "Dispatches" programme on Monday. It also would not comment on whether any of its pilots were on 
zero-hours contracts.
Ryanair's 2013 annual report said safety is the company's "primary priority", starting with the hiring and training of 
its pilots, flight attendants and maintenance staff.
Employees earn productivity-based incentive payments, including some for pilots based on their number of flying 
hours.
But the annual report said Ryanair pilots are subject to limits of 900 flying hours each financial year, as determined 
by Irish regulators.
It added the average number of flying hours by pilots in 2013 was approximately 798 - a 5 per cent decline 
compared to 2012.

When Saad Hammad steps into the top role at Flybe on Thursday he faces a challenge: lifting the struggling airline 
out of loss and getting it fit to compete.
It will not be the first time that Mr Hammad has trodden the turnround path.
While he was chief commercial officer at easyJet from 2005-2009, the airline went from a period of profit warnings 
to growth. As managing director of private equity group Gores, which he has just left, he steered business 
transformations at Siemens corporate telephony and at Mexx.
He comes to the regional carrier with the aim of getting it to break even next year, after a year in which losses piled 
up sevenfold to £40.7m.
The process will be comparable to that at easyJet, Mr Hammad says, although the intention is not to "easyJetify" 
Flybe.
"I had a similar encounter at easyJet when I walked in," he says. "They'd had two profit warnings, there was a lot of 
dysfunction. They didn't have a structured process in terms of route selection and, critically, route management."
It is early days, but Mr Hammad has formulated some hypotheses. A shake-up in strategy will sharpen Flybe's 
offering with a better mix of destinations and more appropriate schedule, for lower fares. The hope is that it will get 
its aircraft fuller - Flybe has a load factor of 62.6 per cent while easyJet and Ryanair are into the 80s.
Saad Hammad has mission to lift Flybe above the turbulence
In its quest to stabilise its core UK market less popular routes will be dropped. But Mr Hammad believes that 
Flybe's strength lies in the thinner routes where the low-cost carriers, with their larger aircraft, would find less profit.
"There are certain routes they cannot fly and we need to maximise those before we go head-on against them. On a 
direct airport level there is hardly any overlap with Ryanair and only a handful of routes where there is overlap with 
easyJet."
On the southeast's flight capacity constraints, Mr Hammand is clear that there should be extra, price-controlled 
capacity, at Gatwick, or Heathrow, which he veers towards, as "the more logical place to do it in terms of the wider 
benefits".
Flybe will "rebalance", tilting away from the three-quarters of its capacity it deploys domestically, to develop routes 
to Europe from its bases of Southampton, Birmingham, Manchester and Belfast.
Southampton, only an hour from London by train, holds special potential, Mr Hammad says, with an opportunity to 
lure passengers from other airports.
"It's getting into the head of customers, understanding not just what they want but what they don't want: hassle, 
congestion, delays."
But with attention fixing on the UK, contract flying now moves down the list of priorities. Flybe Finland, run with 
Finnair, made revenues of £167.2m in its financial year to March 31, and previous chief executive Jim French had 
identified it as a growth area.
"Jim and the team succeeded in securing something with Finnair so full credit there," he says. But while optimising 
that business is desirable, "you can't do contract flying with other European national airlines if your core UK 
business is not solid; they're going to be very nervous dealing with you."
Being able to make decisions like the one on contract flying was essential to Mr Hammad accepting the role, given 
Mr French's deep involvement with Flybe's history.
"I really needed to make sure that there would be a total division of labour and clarity of roles between me and Jim; 
that I effectively would have a free hand running the business and he would be a non-executive chairman. He 
assured me he would not be a back-seat driver - that would give me a free hand to effect the transformation that 
Flybe needs."
The airline is well down the path of that transformation now, with £30m in costs already cut, with a target of £50m 
by 2014-15.
It has sufficient cash to see it through 12 months, Mr Hammad says, and he is firm that he will take "self-help 
measures that can generate cash", such as non-core asset disposals, before he would contemplate any action such 
as a rights issue. Getting a higher proportion of leisure travellers, who book earlier, will aid earnings visibility.
"There's a lot of hard work ahead but we've got a great business."

Ryanair's first-quarter profits fell 21 per cent to EUR78m due to an adverse combination of higher fuel costs, the 
timing of Easter and French air traffic control strikes.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue said its fuel costs had risen 6 per cent compared with the same period 
last year, to make up 47 per cent of its total operating costs. The drop in profits was in line with its forecasts.
The fall in profits was partly offset by revenues earned from reserved seating, which the airline introduced in 
November, as well as from priority boarding and higher credit card fees. Those ancillary earnings rose 25 per cent 
to EUR357m, the airline said in its first-quarter trading statement.
Ryanair's revenue increased 5 per cent to EUR1.3bn, while the number of passengers carried rose 3 per cent to 
23.2m.
Seven new bases in countries including Holland, Poland and Morocco were performing well, the company said. It 
plans to bring in more new bases and start new routes later this year, taking advantage of rival airlines scaling back.
This month, the group said it would sell its 29 per cent stake in rival airline Aer Lingus in response to the 
investigation by the UK competition authority.
The group's shares were down 2.2 per cent in morning trading to EUR7.02.
Ryanair sees sharp fall in profits due to higher fuel costs
The airline was cautious in its outlook for the rest of its year, pointing to tough market conditions including austerity 
and continued high fuel costs. Its guidance for its full-year profit after tax remained unchanged at between 
EUR570m and EUR600m.
"We expect second-quarter yields to rise, despite last year's challenging (post-Olympic) comparables, although 
yields on close-in summer bookings have been slightly weaker in recent weeks, due, we believe, to the heatwave in 
northern Europe," said Michael O'Leary, chief executive.

A prince's birth provides a rare opportunity for publicity. And since William arrived 31 years ago, the internet and 
social media have transformed the speed and sophistication with which advertisers can move.
Ryanair, the no-frills airline, offered free flights to infants booked on July 23, the day after the royal birth, with the 
slogan "Ryan-heir." Coca-Cola used its current personalised bottles campaign to feature a toast between two 
bottles marked "Wills" and "Kate".
But it was a small potato crisp brand that earned the crown for capturing the mood of the event. Golden Wonder, 
owned by Northern Irish foodmaker Tayto Group, sent its packet-shaped mascots to hand out a free bag of crisps to 
anyone queueing third in line - as Prince George is to the throne. In doing so, it married two British institutions: the 
royal family and the queue.
Crisp bags were handed out at cash machines, shops and even lavatories (dubbed "the throne" in British slang).
It was a relatively small stunt, with the same people featuring in some publicity shots because of a shortage of 
those willing to sign consent forms. But the campaign relied on being spread via Facebook and Twitter rather than 
its scale. This is a smart approach for a brand that dominated the market in the 1980s but lacks the marketing 
muscle of PepsiCo, which owns market leader Walkers.

Shares in Barclays made the biggest single loss on the FTSE 100 on Monday amid reports the UK bank will outline 
a plan to boost its capital strength - potentially including a £4bn rights issue.
Barclays is under pressure to disclose how it will address a capital shortfall of as much as £7bn after being told by 
UK regulators that it must boost its leverage ratio, which compares equity with assets.
The bank was expected on Tuesday to detail a combination of measures designed to bridge the gap, including, 
possibly, a rights issue as well as the sale of several billion pounds worth of contingent convertible bonds, so-called 
cocos, which can suffer losses in times of crisis.
News in the Financial Times that the UK government intends to grant £2m in special funding to the Serious Fraud 
Office in connection with a separate investigation into Barclays' emergency fundraising in 2008 may also be casting 
a shadow over the stock.
Barclays fell 2.7 per cent to 311.3p, the biggest loss on the main London index by a clear margin.
Aberdeen Asset Management was the second biggest faller after eye-catching net outflows of £3.4bn from its funds 
in the three months to the end of June. Its shares fell 1.5 per cent to 401p.
WPP was the biggest gainer, climbing 2 per cent to £11.99, after the advertising agency was buoyed by bid activity 
in the sector.
Cash call fears knock Barclays shares
The announcement of a $35bn "merger of equals" between France's Publicis and US group Omnicom, to become 
the world's largest marketing group, drove gains throughout the sector as investors considered potential counter 
moves by others in the advertising market.
Overall, the FTSE 100 was 35 points, or 0.5 per cent higher at 6,590.48, supported also by gains for drugs groups. 
GlaxoSmithKline climbed 1.1 per cent to £16.82, Shire rose 1.8 per cent to £23.69 and AstraZeneca added 1.1 per 
cent to £32.90.
Shares in Ryanair were noticeably weaker, following a reported drop in net profit for the three months ended in 
June and a cautious outlook from chief executive Michael O'Leary. Its London-listed, euro-denominated shares fell 
2.1 per cent to EUR7.02.

Shares in Publicis, the French advertising agency that has plans to merge with US rival Omnicom, climbed as bid 
news helped keep pan-European indices afloat.
The $35bn Franco-US "merger of equals" was signed in Paris on Sunday and, pending shareholder and regulatory 
approval, creates the world's largest marketing company by revenues.
Publicis shares opened for trade at the same time as Omnicom's as New York markets came online and closed 
after two hours of trade up 0.1 per cent to EUR59.40.
"The deal will bring the group significant scale, which in turn will give it bargaining power and scope for significant 
potential synergies," said analysts at Citigroup.
Rival media groups rallied in response. France's Havas gained 4.7 per cent to EUR5.66.
Drugmaker Elan jumped 3.7 per cent to EUR11.55 after US rival Perrigo agreed to pay $8.6bn for the Irish 
company.
Elan put itself up for sale last month after fighting off the advances of Royalty Pharma - rejecting three offers.
Completing a trio of deals, Essilor International, the maker of lenses for spectacles, rallied 6.2 per cent to EUR85.62 
after paying $1.73bn to take full control of Transitions Optical, its joint venture with US company PPG Industries.
Publicis gains as 'merger of equals' buoys European media
Meanwhile, KPN, the Dutch telecoms company which merged its German mobile unit with Telefónica Deutschland 
last week, rose after its biggest shareholder America Movil ended an agreement that keeps its stake below 30 per 
cent.
Although the company owned by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim gave no indication it would raise its stake from the 
current 29.8 per cent, shares in KPN rose 4.6 per cent to EUR1.98.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 climbed 0.1 per cent to 1,206.04, with downside pressure from financial stocks keeping a 
lid on overall gains.
Danone, the French food group, climbed 3.2 per cent to EUR59.27 after reporting like-for-like revenue growth of 6.5 
per cent, beating market forecasts.
The maker of dairy products and bottled waters said it saw a surge in sales of baby nutrition products in China.
Ryanair was one of the biggest fallers after the Irish airline reported a weaker than expected first-quarter profit. Its 
shares fell 2.8 per cent to EUR6.97.

- Barclays kicks off the UK banks' reporting season after an eventful few weeks for the bank, writes Sharlene Goff. 
It is expected to announce a crucial deal with regulators that would give it until 2014 to comply with a tough new 
leverage requirement. Analysts are keen to find out more detail about the kind of action the bank plans to take in 
order to boost its equity - or reduce its asset base to the required level.
The Week Ahead: July 29 - August 4
Analysts expect underlying profit of about £2bn, which will predominantly be driven by the investment banking 
division. Investec Securities forecasts earnings per share of 7.6p for the second quarter, up from 6.7p in the first 
three months.
There will also be interest in any outstanding regulatory issues after Barclays was fined for manipulating prices in 
the US energy market earlier this month. The bank refused to pay the fine and said it would vigorously defend the 
matter in federal courts.
- "Big Oil" will dominate this week's corporate reporting calendar, as Europe and America's biggest integrated 
producers deliver their interim results, writes Michael Kavanagh.
Softening prices during the quarter compared with a year ago have already seen Statoil of Norway, BG Group of 
the UK and Total of France report modest falls in earnings even where production has edged up, though Repsol of 
Spain has bucked the trend.
BP and Royal Dutch Shell of the UK, Eni of Italy and Galp of Portugal join the European throng this week who are 
all expected to report the drag of softening year-on-year oil prices on their revenues.
Joining them are US majors Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil - the world's biggest oil group by market 
capitalisation - which also deliver interims by the end of the week.
BP's continuing legal wrangles in the US surrounding compensation payments following the Deepwater Horizon 
disaster will provide interest beyond the usual issues that surround oil companies' results statements.
At Shell, chief executive Peter Voser will be hosting his company's results less than a month after the Anglo-Dutch 
major announced fellow board member Ben van Beurden as his successor following his retirement from the role at 
the end of the year.
Analysts will be seeking to assess the mood music on expectations of further oil price volatility from industry leaders 
as well as the specifics of exploration success and failure, margins on refining and other downstream businesses 
alongside dividend policies that usually dominate the reporting season.
Some companies may struggle to advance on year-on-year comparisons. However, gains over the quarter made in 
Brent Crude prices and a surge in the West Texas Intermediate benchmark US contract have helped keep planned 
project spending by international oil companies high.
And in spite of the prospect of slowing economic growth in China and other leading developing economies dragging 
on previously buoyant prices since last year, supply interruptions and bouts of concern over stability in the Middle 
East have militated to keep oil prices at historically high levels - along with the rewards on offer for oil majors.
-Fiat is expected to report a year-on-year fall in net profit to EUR305m in the second quarter as Europe's economic 
woes and structural overcapacity continue to weigh on the Italian carmaker, writes Rachel Sanderson.
The group, which owns a majority of US carmaker Chrysler, will see net profit down from EUR348m a year ago, 
according to a poll of analysts by the company. Trading profit is seen in line with last year at about EUR1bn. Net 
industrial debt is expected to have swelled by nearly EUR2bn year-on-year to EUR7.2bn.
Investors are looking for an update from Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of Fiat and Chrysler, on the timing of 
Fiat completing its buyout of Chrysler, the conclusion of which depends on a court decision on how much it should 
pay Veba, a union medical retirement trust that owns the 41.5 per cent of Chrysler not already acquired by Fiat.
New car sales in the EU last month fell 5.6 per cent year on year as sluggish growth and high unemployment 
continued to sap demand. Fiat, Peugeot-Citroen and General Motors were hardest hit.

- IAG will release its half-year earnings and investors will be looking for signs of progress at Iberia, the group's 
struggling Spanish airline, writes Jane Wild.
Pre-tax losses at Iberia widened to EUR670m in the first quarter, after EUR311m of exceptional items relating to its 
restructuring, aimed at getting it on a nimbler footing against rivals. Unions strongly resisted the job losses, which 
will total 3,300 rather than the 4,500 Iberia proposed last year. Analysts will want to see tensions between pilots and 
management resolved.
The Week Ahead: July 29 - August 4
BA, which merged with Iberia in 2011 to form IAG, also recorded an operating loss last quarter compared with the 
same period a year previously, though slightly reduced at £58m. But it signalled last month it was moving towards 
making a maiden dividend.
The analyst consensus for its half year is an operating profit of EUR163m, before exceptional items for the quarter.

European equity market gains were largely results-driven on Wednesday, with the best performances coming from 
the likes of Edenred and Volvo, and other companies raising their targets for the full year.
Edenred, the French voucher and prepaid card operator, climbed 7.1 per cent to EUR24.34 after reporting a 7.7 per 
cent rise in first-half operating profit thanks to strength in its Latin American markets.
The company also forecast full-year core earnings of between EUR370m and EUR390m, up from EUR367m last 
year.
"This is slightly better than we expected and reflects a continuation of current business trends," said James Ainley 
at Citigroup.
Volvo, the Swedish truckmaker, gained 5 per cent to SKr97.90 after reporting profit and order growth in its second 
quarter, thanks to a recovery in demand in most of its main markets. The company said order books had grown in 
recent months, and that it was looking to increase production in the third quarter.
Better than expected results for British budget airline EasyJet helped boost European carriers. Ireland's Ryanair 
added 4.8 per cent to EUR7.37, while Air France-KLM rose 2.6 per cent to EUR6.22.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index climbed 0.6 per cent to 1,214.63. Banks added some weight to the advance, with 
Austria's Erste Bank up 5.8 per cent to EUR22.32. French bank BNP Paribas added 3.5 per cent to EUR47.28.
Edenred and Volvo earnings boost European stocks
Syngenta, the world's biggest agricultural chemicals maker, was the weakest stock on the Eurofirst after it said the 
poor spring weather had hit its earnings in the first half. The shares fell 4 per cent to SFr371, in spite of the 
company issuing a confident outlook for the second half.
KPN, the Dutch telecoms group, was again among the winners as a number of brokers commented on Telefónica 
Deutschland's deal to buy KPN's E-Plus German mobile network. Berenberg raised its price target on KPN to 
EUR2.05 from EUR1.45, while S&P raised its to EUR2 from EUR1.60.
Shares in KPN rose 5.2 per cent to EUR1.95, but Telefónica edged 0.1 per cent lower to EUR10.28 after its 
quarterly results showed that a slowdown in Brazil, its biggest growth market, had dented profits.

Easyjet climbed to the top of the FTSE 100 after the budget airline issued strong full year profit guidance.
Shares in easyJet were up 7 per cent at $14.30 after the company posted a 10.5 per cent rise in quarterly revenue 
and said it expected profit before tax for the year to September to be £450m-£480m, ahead of analyst forecasts.
Ryanair, the Irish carrier, ascended on the back of its rival's results. Its London-listed shares were up 3.9 per cent to 
EUR7.28.
Arm Holdings was the second-biggest riser on the FTSE, up 2.9 per cent to £9.25 after its quarterly results.
The chip designer reported that revenues were up 26 per cent in the second quarter, ahead of analysts' 
expectations in the first set of results released since chief executive Simon Segars replaced long-time head Warren 
East in the top job.
Overall, the FTSE 100 was up 0.6 per cent at 6,634.23

Ryanair is commendably efficient about boarding and unloading its planes. The same cannot be said for the 
handling of its six-year-old stake in rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus. In familiarly colourful language, the low-cost airline 
announced on Tuesday that it is now willing to offload this to another EU-based airline, provided that carrier is 
making a bid for Aer Lingus and has obtained 50.1 per cent acceptances. The market yawned - Aer Lingus's share 
price was largely unchanged - and investors should be unimpressed, too.
The statement comes after two bids by Ryanair for Aer Lingus were blocked by European antitrust officials. It also 
comes just ahead of a final UK Competition Commission ruling on whether Ryanair's retention of a minority stake in 
its Irish rival has anti-competitive implications. The Competition Commission's provisional findings, in May, were 
that it does. One of the reasons was that this stake might prevent the acquisition of Aer Lingus by another carrier. 
But that was far from being the whole story. Competition Commission officials thought the Ryanair stake could 
make it more difficult for Aer Lingus to attract a friendly strategic minority investor, for example, or to proactively 
manage its Heathrow slot portfolio. In short, assuming those conclusions are confirmed, Ryanair's latest "remedy" 
offering looks laughably inadequate.
Perhaps the best that investors could conclude is that the low-cost carrier now realises the Aer Lingus saga is into 
an end-game. If so, it would be nice if it called off its appeal, still under way, over the second EU antitrust block and 
stood down its lawyers generally on this matter. That would be in the spirit of efficiency. Then again, "nice" was 
never really Ryanair's most noticeable attribute.

Body
Ryanair has agreed to sell its minority stake in Aer Lingus to any EU airline interested in acquiring the company in a 
last-ditch effort to stave off regulatory action from UK competition authorities.
Europe's largest low cost airline by revenue made the offer on Tuesday, saying it would unconditionally sell its 29 
per cent shareholding in its Irish rival to any EU airline that wants to buy Aer Lingus and that obtains acceptances 
from 50.1 per cent of shareholders.
"This remedy unconditionally removes any ability by Ryanair to block any future takeover of Aer Lingus by another 
EU airline," said Robin Kiely, Ryanair's head of communications.
He said the unconditional offer by Ryanair removed "any remaining shred of credibility" from the UK competition 
authorities' investigation into Ryanair's minority stake in its Irish rival.
In May the UK Competition Commission made a provisional ruling, which said that allowing Ryanair to maintain its 
29 per cent stake in Aer Lingus could reduce competition on routes between the UK and Ireland. It also found the 
stake could hinder another airline's ability to acquire or merge with Aer Lingus. The commission is due to make a 
final decision by September 5 on whether Ryanair should be forced to sell all or part of its stake in Aer Lingus.
Analysts said the unconditional offer was part of Ryanair's battle with the UK competition authorities to be allowed 
to retain its minority stake.
Ryanair offers to sell Aer Lingus stake to shake off regulators
"This does not change the game in our view, but gives Ryanair a counter argument to the UK Competition 
Commission's suggestion that it is blocking any potential takeover of Aer Lingus," said Donal O'Neill, analyst with 
Goodbody stockbrokers.
"It gives Ryanair a hook with which to appeal any negative decision by the commission," he said.
The commission has the power to order companies to divest a minority stake if it finds the holding enables the 
owner to influence the behaviour and policies of a target company in a way that harms competition.
In 2010, BSkyB was forced to sell 10 per cent of a 17.9 per cent minority stake that it held in ITV when the 
commission found the shareholding would give rise to a substantial lessening of competition.
Ryanair's battle with the Competition Commission is the latest twist in the airline's long-running campaign to retain 
some control over Aer Lingus. Last year EU regulators blocked Ryanair's third bid in eight years to take over Aer 
Lingus, ruling that the proposed transaction would increase fares for passengers and create a monopoly on 46 UK-
Irish routes.

European telecoms were boosted on Tuesday after Dutch group KPN agreed to sell its German mobile unit to 
Spain's Telefónica.
Telefónica Deutschland, the third largest of the four mobile operators in Germany, said it would pay EUR5bn in 
cash for E-Plus, KPN's unit and the smallest of the four players in the German market. KPN would also take a stake 
in the enlarged group worth EUR3.1bn.
Shares in KPN added 2.8 per cent to EUR1.85, having gained 12.9 per cent in the previous session when the news 
of the offer broke. Telefónica gained 2.3 per cent to EUR10.29.
The merger would first have to be approved by European antitrust authorities, but analysts noted this would bring 
forward a number of positives for other telecoms groups.
"Telecom Italia would try again to merge with Hutchison in Italy, while TeliaSonera will finally manage to sell Yoigo 
in Spain," said John Karidis at Oriel Securities.
Telecom Italia was riding high on pan-European indices, up 6.7 per cent to EUR0.52, helped also by talk that it is 
about to recieve preliminary approval for its planned spin off of its fixed line network.
Meanwhile, Bouygues, the French conglomerate, topped the FTSE Eurofirst 300 after it said it had entered talks 
with Vivendi on a scheme to share parts of their mobile telecoms networks to help both companies reduce costs. 
Shares in Bouygues jumped 6.9 per cent to EUR22, while Vivendi, which is in talks to sell its Maroc Telecom stake 
to Etisalat, added 2.4 per cent to EUR16.08.

The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended the session 0.3 per cent lower at 1,207.16, with downward pressure from airlines.
Shares in BBVA climbed 3.4 per cent to EUR6.66 after UBS upgraded the Spanish bank to buy, saying the risks in 
Spain would be mitigated by its strength in Latin America.
Swatch Group, the Swiss watchmaker rose 1.7 per cent to SFr538.50 after saying it expected a strong second half 
following profit growth of 6.1 per cent in the first six months.
Shares in Ryanair fell 3 per cent to EUR7.03 after the Irish budget airline said it would sell its stake in domestic rival 
Aer Lingus to any European airline interested in acquiring the company.

MAG presses case for Stansted expansion

Stansted could surpass Heathrow to become a new international hub airport with four runways capable of handling 
up to 160m passengers a year, according to its owner Manchester Airports Group.
MAG proposed the idea to the Davies Commission, set up to examine options for airport expansion. Heathrow's bid 
to build a third runway has been stalled because it would add to noise levels.
MAG says that only 1,250 residents are affected by noise at the Essex airport, compared with 258,500 at Heathrow.
The £10bn cost would dwarf that of building a new airport in the Thames estuary, as proposed by Boris Johnson, 
the London mayor.
Charlie Cornish, chief executive of MAG, said: "Stansted is uniquely placed to meet the UK's aviation capacity 
needs now and over the next 15 years. Almost overnight, Stansted could double the number of flights it handles 
without any need for significant investment in new infrastructure.
"The costs and the environmental impacts of building new capacity at Stansted are likely to be far lower than at 
alternative locations. From the short term to the long term, Stansted ticks every box."
However, he said the commission should first consider expanding a number of regional airports, likely to be "best 
for passengers".
That would see the likes of Manchester and Birmingham, which have spare capacity, attracting local passengers 
who use Heathrow and acting as mini international hubs, with Gatwick and Stansted adding a second runway too.
MAG presses case for Stansted expansion
"Should the commission take a different view and conclude that the UK needs an effective hub to provide 
international connectivity, then Stansted could certainly fulfil that role in a cost-effective way," Mr Cornish added.
He said that a Stansted expansion would also help boost the economy of fast-growing places such as Cambridge 
and Milton Keynes nearby.
Stansted is the third largest airport in the southeast, with more than 150 destinations and 17.5m passengers last 
year. It is heavily reliant on Ryanair, the Irish low cost carrier.
Manchester is the only UK airport outside Heathrow with two runways and MAG believes its experience in obtaining 
planning permission for it and operating it stands it in good stead.
MAG, the UK's second largest airport operator, is still majority owned by Manchester City Council and its nine 
neighbouring authorities. To fund the Stansted acquisition, it struck a deal with Industry Funds Management of 
Australia last year in which the Australian group took a 35.5 per cent equity stake and 50 per cent of voting rights.
The Commission chaired by Sir Howard Davies will report after the 2015 election.
On Wednesday Heathrow, the UK's only hub which is operating at near full capacity, set out proposals to add a 
third runway and, possibly, a fourth.
On Monday Mr Johnson backed the case for a new four-runway hub on the sparsely populated Isle of Grain - a 
proposal similar to one by Lord Foster, the architect.

EasyJet hit a record high after one of the few bears on the stock capitulated.
JPMorgan turned positve on EasyJet with a £15.40 target price - more than double its previous valuation of 625p 
set in April.
The upgrade left only one out of 28 covering brokerages to advise selling the airline, which has been this year's 
biggest blue-chip gainer.
Bankruptcy protection in the US has spurred structural change that has cut the gap between established airlines 
and discount carriers, JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker said.
The result has been better pricing power, less infighting and a broad acceptance of ancillary fees, all of which have 
been welcomed by airline investors, he argued.
But without the legal muscle provided by a US-style bankruptcy system, European airlines were unlikely to undergo 
US-style restructuring.
As a result, European flag carriers will keep struggling to close the profit gap on the discount sector, JPMorgan 
said.
"Put bluntly, discounters' inherent cost and operating flexibilities are best put to use when there are infirm operators 
on which to prey, and we see the most opportunity in markets such as France, Italy and Germany," Mr Baker said.
EasyJet rose 4.1 per cent to £14.06, taking its gain for the year so far to 84 per cent.
EasyJet climbs after bearish broker capitulates
JPMorgan also turned positive on Ryanair, up 3.3 per cent to EUR7.33 and ahead 56 per cent in the year to date.
In the wider market, a broad-based advance lifted the FTSE 100 to a seven-week high, up 62.43 points, or 1 per 
cent, to 6,634.36.
London Stock Exchange  led the blue-chip risers, up 7.4 per cent to £15.90, after its quarterly trading update 
showed organic revenue increasing 8 per cent, at the top end of market expectations.
Advertising agency WPP rose 3.6 per cent to £12.10 after sector peers Omnicom and Publicis both gave cautiously 
positive outlook statements.
Sports Direct added 6.3 per cent to 638p, a record high, on well-received annual earnings upbeat guidance on 
current trading.
The gain gave Sports Direct a market value of £3.6bn, which would put it on the cusp of promotion to the FTSE 100 
at the next index review.
Vodafone edged 0.5 per cent to 191.4p lower after US partner Verizon posted second-quarter wireless earnings 
were slightly worse than expected, though it expected customer numbers to improve in the second half.
"This is the first time for several quarters that Verizon Wireless has disappointed and means that Vodafone is more 
exposed to potential earnings downside from its underperforming rump," said Deutsche Bank. "To maximize the 
potential value from its Verizon Wireless stake, Vodafone should look to sell the asset now."
Man Group lost 1.6 per cent to 87.7p after RBC forecast the fund manager to cut its full-year dividend by 77 per 
cent.
Whereas most other asset managers have been reporting net inflows, Man was likely to report an eighth straight 
quarter of asset withdrawals, RBC said.
The poor recent performance of AHL, Man's benchmark fund, meant net inflows may fail to materialise in 2014 
which would indicate a value of just 60p per share, it said.
Soco International  faded 3.8 per cent to 357.8p on strong volume, which traders said may suggest a setback in 
Vietnam.
The explorer has results due shortly from an offshore appraisal well at its flagship TGT field and has been testing 
increased production rates at the site.

Aer Lingus looks to long-haul growth to fuel Dublin expansion

Aer Lingus is expanding its long-haul business to boost growth and position Dublin airport as a transatlantic hub as 
it awaits a crucial decision on its future ownership by UK competition authorities.
On Thursday the Irish airline reported an 18.2 per cent increase in passenger numbers on long-haul routes in June, 
compared with the same month last year. It has also announced plans to open new routes to the US and Canada 
and boost transatlantic capacity by almost a quarter next year.
"This is a new chapter for Aer Lingus. We are back to growth mode," said Christoph Mueller, chief executive.
Mr Mueller joined Aer Lingus during a crisis in 2009 - a year when the airline posted a pre-tax loss of EUR155m and 
Ireland plunged into economic turmoil. Since then he has cut costs, reoriented the airline towards transatlantic 
rather than global expansion and returned the airline to profit. Aer Lingus made a pre-tax profit of EUR84.4m in 
2011 and EUR40.6m in 2012.
Rather than buy its own planes to expand its long-haul fleet, Aer Lingus has agreed a "wet lease" deal with ASL 
Aviation Group, which will provide aircraft and pilots for the new routes.
"This is a lower-risk option for the company," said Joshua Goldman, analyst with Davy Stockbrokers.
"With the consolidated transatlantic market and good inbound and transfer demand, the expansion of service to 
North America could offer opportunities for the company," he said.
Aer Lingus looks to long-haul growth to fuel Dublin expansion
Mr Mueller told the FT that Aer Lingus - which is already the third biggest holder of landing slots at Heathrow airport 
- is on the look out for opportunities to buy more Heathrow slots.
"A lot of people are very keen to use them for long haul but that is not for us," he said.
He said the best use of the Heathrow slots for Aer Lingus was as a "conveyor belt" shuttle carrier bringing 
passengers into the hub airport on the hour.
Aer Lingus faces two big challenges in the near term: Ryanair's refusal to sell off its 30 per cent stake in the airline 
and potential liabilities related to an employee pension scheme.
The UK competition commission is due to make a ruling on whether Ryanair should be forced to sell its 30 per cent 
stake in its Irish rival by early September. Removing Ryanair from the share register could open up opportunities for 
other airlines, including Etihad Airways, which has built up a 3 per cent stake in the airline.
But Mr Mueller told the FT that foreign ownership rules, which prevent non-EU airlines from owning more than 49 
per cent of an European carrier, complicates the situation for airline investors.
"From a buyer's point of view what do you do with a minority shareholding? You cannot really impose your 
strategy," he said.
"I believe the best solution for Aer Lingus would be for it to just be another airline listed on the stock market like an 
IAG, like Lufthansa, with a widely spread shareholder community and a nice mixture of institutional investors," he 
said.
He said he hoped talks on an EU-US free trade could provide a breakthrough on foreign ownership rules.
Aer Lingus is also backing a proposal from Ireland's Labour court to solve a longstanding row with trade unions 
over a pension scheme that the airline's employees share with other aviation workers. Under the proposal Aer 
Lingus would make a one-off EUR140m payment towards employee pensions.
Pension trustees have not yet agreed to the proposal, while Ryanair opposes Aer Lingus making any payment.
However, Mr Mueller said he was "fairly optimistic" a solution could be agreed.

Michael Cawley, one of three Ryanair executives who turned the Irish low-cost carrier into Europe's largest low-cost 
airline by revenue, announced on Monday that he would step down from the position of chief operating officer next 
year.
Mr Cawley will relinquish his full-time executive role next March, and he is expected to become a non-executive 
director at Ryanair two months later. He also plans to pursue separate business interests, including non-executive 
roles at other companies.
The 58-year-old, a chartered accountant by training, told the Financial Times he was standing down at a time of his 
choosing.
Mr Cawley joined Ryanair in 1997, the year the company floated, and he has held the positions of chief financial 
officer, commercial director and chief operating officer - the last of these roles he has done for a decade.
He also holds the title of deputy chief executive - a position he shares with Howard Millar, the current chief financial 
officer.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said Mr Cawley had made an "enormous contribution to the successful 
growth and development of Ryanair".
Mr Cawley has been responsible for Ryanair opening new routes - and striking cut-price deals with airports that 
help underpin the company's strong earnings.
Ryanair chief operating officer to step down next year
Ryanair said Mr O'Leary, leading manager since 1994, had "indicated he hopes to stay on for many years yet" at 
the company.
On more than one occasion in the past, Mr O'Leary has said he would stay on for "two or three years" more, only to 
continue well past these dates.
In March he finalised an order for 175 Boeing short-haul aircraft that will provide Ryanair with a fresh phase of 
growth.
Stephen Furlong, analyst at Davy, which is also Ryanair's broker, said Mr O'Leary and the rest of the management 
team appeared committed to the company for the medium term.

Airlines will struggle to pay for the next generation of more fuel-efficient passenger jets unless governments and 
carriers take steps to improve industry profitability, the sector's representative body warned on Monday.
The International Air Transport Association used a report about the sector's weak earnings record to urge 
governments to take a more relaxed view on global mergers, because consolidation is seen as a key driver of 
profits.
The Iata report, based on research by McKinsey, the consulting firm, found that between 2004 and 2011 the airline 
industry's annual returns on invested capital - an important measure of profitability - averaged 4.1 per cent.
This was a slight improvement on the 3.8 per cent recorded between 1996 and 2004, but is still significantly below 
the industry's weighted average cost of capital of 7.5 per cent - which represents the return that equity and debt 
investors would expect to earn by investing in assets of similar risk outside the sector.
With the majority of airlines now owned by private investors, following a wave of privatisations, Boeing estimated 
last month that carriers would need to buy aircraft worth $4.8tr over the next 20 years.
But Tony Tyler, Iata director-general, said: "Unless we find ways to improve returns for our investors it may prove 
difficult to attract $4tr-5tr of capital we need to serve the expansion of connectivity over the next two decades.
"Airlines . . . face a hyper fragmented industry structure owing to government policies that discourage cross-border 
consolidation. There is plenty of room for some fresh thinking."
Iata calls for more airline consolidation
Iata highlighted how over the past 30 to 40 years the airline industry has generated one of the lowest returns on 
invested capital among all sectors - although there are some exceptions, notably the low-cost carriers led by 
Ryanair.
The Iata report noted that other parts of the aviation industry - particularly the companies running global distribution 
systems that provide computerised airline bookings - were found to have returns well in excess of their cost of 
capital.
But the report had few prescriptions for improving carriers' profitability. It highlighted Delta Air Lines' unusual move 
last year to buy an oil refinery to cut its fuel bill, but accepted other airlines may not be able to do this.
Carriers' generally weak profitability was blamed partly on the commoditisation of air travel and the lack of industry 
consolidation.
But governments have shown limited enthusiasm to reform foreign ownership rules that would allow cross-border 
mergers between airlines.
The European Commission's latest push to persuade Washington to reform rules that prevent foreign companies 
from owning more than 25 per cent of the voting stock of the US airlines has made little progress.

The chief executive of Flybe has insisted that the troubled UK carrier was on track to "reclaim its position as 
Europe's leading regional airline", in spite of the group reporting a near sevenfold increase in its annual pre-tax 
losses.
The Exeter-based carrier on Friday blamed restructuring charges and higher staff and fuel costs, for its full-year 
pre-tax loss of £40.7m, compared with a loss of £6.2m last year.
However, investors were cheered by the airline's turnround plan, and pushed up Flybe shares 9 per cent to 45p in 
early trading, valuing the airline's equity at £35m.
Flybe's UK division alone reported a £32.5m loss, exacerbated by a 1.1 per cent year on year fall in passenger 
numbers to 7.2m as cash-strapped customers shunned air travel in favour of cheaper alternatives.
The regional carrier's UK division lost about £4.50 for every seat flown, while its load factor - an industry measure of 
how well Flybe fills its aircraft - edged up 1 percentage point to 64.1, still well below the 85-plus regularly recorded 
by Ryanair and easyJet.
"Our results for 2012/13, while expected, are nonetheless disappointing," said Jim French, Flybe's chairman and 
chief executive.
"During the year, we have taken difficult decisions as part of our turnround plan, which have affected all our people. 
Challenging as they have been, these decisions were critical to ensuring the future success of Flybe."
Flybe strikes upbeat note despite near sevenfold surge in losses
In January, Flybe initiated a restructuring that included the axing of 300 staff - including one-fifth of its UK-based 
management - and the outsourcing of support services such as on-board catering and aircraft maintenance.
Mr French said that Flybe's restructuring would deliver £40m in savings in the current financial year to March 31, 
which were expected to rise to £50m in annual savings from the following year.
Other remedial actions have included the sale of its takeover slots at Gatwick airport to easyJet for £20m - 
effectively quitting its main London hub - and deferring the delivery of 16 Embraer E-series regional jets.
The airline booked £12.8m in restructuring costs during the year - at the upper end of its previous estimation of 
£10m-£12m, with further costs of about £5m likely to be incurred this year, bringing the total to about £18m.
Flybe is Europe's largest regional airline, flying to more than 200 routes from more than 100 airports across 23 
countries.
In the 12 months to March 31, revenue fell by £1m to £614.3m, and the diluted loss per share grew from 8.5p to 
55.6p.
The airline's joint venture with Finnair reported a pre-tax loss of £6.5m, narrowing from a loss of £9.1m the previous 
year, from revenues up from £63.5m to £167.2m.

"Our results for 2012/13, while expected, are nonetheless disappointing," said Jim French, Flybe's chairman and 
chief executive, adding that the next 18 months would be vital in implementing the turnround plan.
Flybe would look to grow by increasing its contract flying operations, and identified its operations from Southampton 
airport as "a key part of its future", Mr French said.
Analysts said that rival low-cost carriers would present a challenge to that aim.
In January, Flybe initiated a restructuring that included the axing of 300 staff - including one-fifth of its UK-based

Other remedial actions have included the sale of its takeover slots at Gatwick airport to easyJet for £20m and the 
deferment of a delivery of 16 Embraer E-series regional jets.
"The recent sale of Gatwick slots and the announced deferral of new aircraft orders should provide the group with 
some cash to fund its restructuring programme, but we think it unlikely that the shares will re-rate until management 
can provide some tangible evidence of the turnround," said Edward Stanford, analyst at Oriel Securities.
The airline booked £12.8m in restructuring costs during the year - at the upper end of its previous estimation of 
£10m-£12m, with further costs of about £5m likely to be incurred this year, bringing the total to about £18m.

Flybe shares rose as much as 9 per cent in early trading, before falling back to close up 1.2 per cent at 41.75p, 
valuing the airline's equity at £31m.

Snippets of merger talk emerged to provide slight relief from the heavy selling in European stocks seen across all 
markets and all sectors.
Elan Corporation, the Irish drugmaker that last week put itself up for sale in order to fend off a hostile bid from 
Royalty Pharma, climbed 4.2 per cent to EUR10.53 on talk that US rival Forest Laboratories was among those who 
had expressed an interest.
Royalty dropped its $8bn hostile bid for Elan on Tuesday but has said it remains interested in taking part in the sale 
process.
Nokia has also been the subject of much speculation in recent sessions and on Thursday it was reported the 
Finnish mobile handset maker and networks operator was in talks to sell its mobile unit to Microsoft, with whom it 
already shares a partnership.
The shares were up 5.1 per cent to EUR3 after also advancing in the previous session on rumours of bid interest 
from China's Huawei.
Ryanair was also one of the few gainers after it announced plans to return up to EUR1bn to shareholders through 
buybacks and dividends. Its shares climbed 1.2 per cent to EUR7.06.
But the overwhelming weight was towards the downside with financials and carmakers among the biggest losers. 
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 3.1 per cent to 1,143.99.
Bid talk gives battered stocks a touch of Elan
Among the biggest fallers on the pan-European index was French carmaker Renault, down 6.8 per cent to 
EUR53.49.
The sector, which bore the heaviest losses of all the Eurofirst's industry groups, saw Germany's Volkswagen fall 3.9 
per cent to EUR147.60 and Italy's Fiat lose 4.8 per cent to EUR5.28.
Richemont and Swatch were both prominent losers after data showed Swiss watch exports were down 3.9 per cent 
in May, largely due to weakness in shipping to China.
Shares in Richemont, owner of the Cartier and Piaget brands, fell 5.2 per cent to SFr80.70, while Swatch lost 5.2 
per cent to SFr506.50.
Turkey's BIST 100 was the worst performing of the region's domestic indexes, losing 6.8 per cent to 73,461.89 on 
fears that investors will withdraw funds from riskier emerging markets.

Is it harder to succeed as an entrepreneur because big companies control more industries than they did? This was 
the suggestion of a recent article by Ben Casselman in the Wall Street Journal. He made the case that start-ups are 
declining because animal spirits are fading in the US.
I profoundly disagree with his contentions, and there are statistics to back my case. The Global Entrepreneurship 
Monitor, an annual assessment published jointly by Babson College and London Business School, found that total 
activity in the US in 2012 was at its highest level since 1999.
In particular I take issue with the idea that "dominance of large corporations in nearly every industry . . . makes it 
tough for new ventures to gain a foothold". I believe quite the opposite: the tendency towards consolidation creates 
opportunities for innovative newcomers.
Take banking in the UK. For decades it has been a cosy oligopoly. But like sheep, several banks overextended and 
almost went bust during the financial crisis. The traditional high street banks have also alienated customers with 
poor service and scandals such as the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. Despite regulatory and capital 
hurdles, a number of new players are upsetting the cartel - from Aldermore to Metro Bank (where I am a director), 
from Virgin to peer-to-peer lenders. I predict there will be many more, who will relentlessly erode the share of the 
slothful incumbents, most of which have terrible reputations combined with demoralised management, and have 
underinvested in IT and their branches. Only customer inertia has saved them from losing much bigger chunks of 
their business. But over time, it will happen.
Bookmaking is another sector where a trio of operators - William Hill, Ladbrokes and Corals - has commanded the 
market for decades. A fourth group, Paddy Power, came to Britain less than a decade ago, with just three shops by 
Titans can always be cut downto size
2005. But through entertaining punters with its quirky marketing, the Irish gambling business has expanded 100-fold 
in the past eight years.
When partners and I took control of PizzaExpress it had just 12 company-owned restaurants. It was a distant fourth 
behind Pizza Hut, Pizzaland and Deep Pan Pizza. But our offering was superior, and the public knew it. Within 10 
years, two of the three market leaders had shut down and the other has been in retreat for years. PizzaExpress, 
meanwhile, has grown 20-fold, and is now the leader. The majors were complacent and unwilling to reinvent their 
model - and suffered the consequences.
Even in fields that require significant capital there are regular launches. Legacy airlines have faced a ferocious 
assault from low-cost rivals such as Ryanair and easyJet, coming as if from nowhere to overtake national 
champions. Despite heavy regulation and fierce competition, they have succeeded by offering a no-frills service - 
demonstrating that no industry is invulnerable.
In almost every market, upstarts come along and disrupt the status quo. Technology, social shifts, deregulation and 
drive can lead to dislocation in any industry. It can be intimidating to confront businesses with long-established, 
commanding shares. But from Sir James Dyson taking on the might of Hoover in vacuum cleaners, to 
salesforce.com challenging Siebel Systems in customer relationship management, the history of capitalism has 
been forged by newcomers outcompeting bigger rivals.
Moreover many sectors are still fragmented. From catering to hairdressing, from construction to car repair, there are 
thousands of ubiquitous activities where small, family-owned concerns comprise the majority. They all represent 
ripe territory, waiting for disrupters to make their mark. Having spent 20 years in the food and drink business, I know 
that even the oldest trades are bursting with prospects.
Waves of consolidation in many sectors have come and gone. Big companies rise and die. Globalisation and the 
digital revolution have helped lower barriers to entry, and enabled fresh participants to compete in hundreds of 
sectors. Be it media, retailing, telecoms or financial services, industries that appeared unassailable have been 
turned upside down. The only constraints are the ingenuity and ambition of pioneering entrepreneurs.

Bombardier: CSeries pitches for slice of narrow-body jet market

The moment when a Bombardier CSeries jet taxis out on to the runway for its first flight is unlikely to be widely 
televised live, as the maiden flights of Boeing's 787 and Airbus's A380 were. But, as the first aircraft heads into the 
skies above Quebec, probably later this month, it could mark a moment every bit as significant as those higher-
profile maiden flights.
If the aircraft can meet expectations, it could transform competition in the narrow-body jet market - which accounts 
for far more aircraft sales annually than the higher-profile wide-body market in which the 787 and A380 compete. 
Success for the aircraft would disrupt the duopoly in narrow-body jets between Boeing's 737 family of aircraft and 
Airbus's A320. Bombardier of Canada, already the world's third-largest commercial aircraft maker by sales, would 
become a far more important force.
The manufacturer nevertheless has been struggling to persuade customers that the CSeries will meet their needs. 
It has so far won only 145 firm orders against a target of 300 by the time the aircraft enters service in mid-2014.
Since Bombardier first announced plans for the aircraft in 2004, Airbus and Boeing have announced new, more 
fuel-efficient versions of their narrow-body models - the A320neo and Boeing 737 Max - intended to satisfy some of 
the demand that the CSeries originally aimed at meeting.
Guy Hachey, chief operating officer of Bombardier Aerospace, insists, however, that the order levels are similar to 
those for other launches of new, unproven aircraft designs ahead of first flight. The maiden flight will win over 
doubters, he says.
Bombardier: CSeries pitches for slice of narrow-body jet market
"People want to know if it's true," Mr Hachey says of the claims made for new types. "We're going to fly by the end 
of the month. Then we can prove to the world that Bombardier has done it, definitely."
Questions over the aircraft's performance - and whether it provides a sufficient edge over Boeing's and Airbus's 
rival aircraft - are likely to be far more significant for the programme's future than development delays, according to 
Mr Hachey. The company announced a six-month delay to the planned first flight in November last year.
"With a programme such as the CSeries, if you're going to be moving milestones by a few months, it's not really 
considered to be late," Mr Hachey says, adding that first flight for many other new commercial jet types in recent 
years has been years late.
The scale of the commercial problem facing the CSeries was clear in March when Michael O'Leary, chief executive 
of Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier that is one of the world's largest operators of narrow-body aircraft, came to 
New York.
Mr O'Leary was in the city to sign an order with Boeing for at least 175 of its 737-800 aircraft. When asked whether 
he would consider switching from the 737 to Airbus's A320, he indicated that the 180 seats of the largest A320 were 
inadequate for Ryanair's needs and that the carrier much preferred operating the 189-seat capacity of the 737-800.
Mr O'Leary's stance illustrates how many operators of narrow-body aircraft want to pack in as many passengers as 
possible to cover the high costs of operating aircraft over relatively short distances.
"We've always held the view that we would like a slightly larger aircraft," Mr O'Leary said. "If Boeing had a way of 
getting another 10 seats on to the Boeing 737-800, that would be the perfect sweet spot."
Mr O'Leary's stance illustrates the risk that customers could opt for the higher-capacity but new and more fuel-
efficient 737 and A320 variants over the CSeries.
Nevertheless, Mr Hachey insists there is a market for aircraft of the CSeries size that has gone largely 
unaddressed. Most of the variants will carry between just over 100 passengers and 149.
"That was a market that was not served by our competition," Mr Hachey says. "We feel comfortable that this market 
segment does exist."
He adds, however, that some customers have expressed interest in a potential larger CSeries aircraft seating up to 
160 passengers.
"That gives even more economies of scale, with an aircraft that already has low operating costs," Mr Hachey says.
The immediate challenge, however, is to ensure that the CSeries avoids the technical problems that prolonged the 
flight-testing programmes of the 787 and A380.
There is significant potential for risk. Many of the aircraft's fuel savings come from its use of Pratt & Whitney's new 
geared turbofan engine - a jet engine that, unusually, has gears to keep the intake fan and internal turbines running 
at different speeds. Parts of the wing fairings will be made of light aluminium lithium alloys that have previously not 
been widely used for commercial aircraft.
Mr Hachey says, however, that there has been substantial testing of both the novel materials and the new engine to 
ensure that both work well when installed on the aircraft. The company considered but rejected the technology that 
has posed most problems for Boeing with its 787 - the lithium-ion batteries that twice suffered severe overheating 
and in one case a fire in aircraft in January, leading to the entire fleet's grounding.
Mr Hachey hopes that the cautious approach should ensure that, when engineers start examining data from this 
month's first flight, they will reveal results that help to boost the type's sales.
Bombardier: CSeries pitches for slice of narrow-body jet market
"The technology we're bringing to the market is proven technology, although we have some new technology," Mr 
Hachey says. "We're very comfortable with where we are."

For investors in US airlines, a near-decade of consolidation is starting to bring tangible benefits. Last month, Delta 
Air Lines, the second-largest carrier by revenue, announced plans to issue a dividend this year - the first such 
payout since 2003.
Contrast this with Europe where Lufthansa, the region's largest carrier by sales, in February proposed suspending 
its dividend. European airlines are struggling with a prolonged economic downturn in many of their home countries, 
but Lufthansa's move also underlined how cut-throat competition weighs heavily on the region's carriers.
In the US, consolidation that goes back to the merger of US Airways and America West in 2005 is set to culminate 
by the end of September with the expected tie-up between American Airlines and US Airways. The large eight 
airlines of 10 years ago are on course to become the big four, with reduced competition meaning that the remaining 
players have greater pricing power - the ability to raise fares after years of slashing ticket prices during market 
share grabs.
This level of market concentration means that US airline consolidation is likely to be mainly done. In Europe, there 
is a case for more mergers because there are still far too many airlines, but it may well be that the region sees a 
series of carrier collapses rather than deals.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group (IAG), which was created from the merger of British 
Airways and Iberia with the intent of becoming a leading industry consolidator, said last month that he saw no 
opportunities in the short to medium term.
Consolidation: Concentration of carriers puts collapse on Europe agenda
"It's clear there are a lot of airlines in play," he said. "Most of these are peripheral airlines that we can't see adding 
any value to the IAG group - or, in all honesty, adding any value to pretty much anybody. So we don't have any 
proposals to do anything."
The big European airline deals have already happened. Before the creation of IAG in 2011, Air France merged with 
KLM of the Netherlands in 2004, while Lufthansa combined with Swiss in 2005 and Austrian Airlines in 2009.
These three large flag carrier groups are now busy restructuring their short-haul operations, some of which are 
lossmaking because of intense competition from low-cost airlines led by Ryanair and easyJet.
The budget airlines show no sign of letting up in their quest to increase market share at the expense of the flag 
carriers - Ryanair placed an order for 175 narrow-body aircraft worth $15.6bn at catalogue prices from Boeing in 
March, and easyJet is expected to announce a large, single-aisle jet purchase soon.
Against this backdrop, where Air France-KLM, IAG and Lufthansa are preoccupied with cutting costs rather than 
doing deals, even smaller flag carriers with a potentially valuable niche have struggled to attract buyers.
The Portuguese government last December shelved the privatisation of Transportes Aéreos Portugueses, the 
country's flag carrier and one of Europe's leading airlines flying to Brazil, after only attracting one bid.
IAG and Lufthansa decided against making binding offers, in spite of both having an interest in increasing their 
presence in the fast-growing Latin American market.
Lisbon is expected to try to revive the privatisation, but even if TAP is acquired, such a deal could well be 
outnumbered by carrier collapses.
Meanwhile, with many countries having foreign ownership rules that prevent airline consolidation at a global level, 
the most notable development over the past year has been the tie-up between Qantas and Emirates Airlines.
This partnership - based on a codeshare arrangement and announced last September - is providing the Australian 
flag carrier with the opportunity to try to restore its international operations to profit by scrapping lossmaking flights. 
Qantas is flying to Emirates' Dubai hub, where passengers can transfer on to the Gulf carrier's wide range of flights 
to Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
This agreement also highlights how the relatively young, state-controlled Gulf carriers are no longer viewed as 
enemy number one by longer-established airlines. After years of intense competition, some Asian and European 
carriers are forging deals with the fast-expanding Gulf airlines.
Last October, Air France-KLM, which reported a EUR1.2bn net loss in 2012, unveiled a code-share agreement with 
Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways. Later that month, the oneworld global airline alliance - led by British Airways and 
American Airlines - announced that Doha-based Qatar Airways was joining. It is the first of the big Gulf carriers to 
join an alliance.
Lufthansa, the only large European flag carrier not to reach a deal with one of these Gulf carriers, has been 
considering the case for a partnership with Turkish Airlines, the fast-growing Istanbul-based carrier.
"The combination of our two strong markets and a strong cultural fit ... could make co-operation attractive if both 
partners can participate," said Simone Menne, Lufthansa's finance director.

Tricky decision for housebuyers seeking a bargain in Normandy

The proximity of Normandy to Paris has made the northern French region a favourite weekend retreat for residents 
of the capital - and particularly those with an interest in horses, given the region's myriad equestrian clubs and its 
concentration of stud farms.
Normandy has attracted British horse lovers, too. In 2000, Nicky and Steve Bodman moved from Warwickshire to 
an 18th-century farmhouse near the village of Saint-Siméon, with 30 acres of land including an ancient standing 
stone and burial ground. The property also came with three guest houses the couple now rent out.
When they first moved to France, with their two horses, the Bodmans spent several months renting a house in the 
Limousin region of south-central France. "It was beautiful but the flies ate the horses alive and there was also a 
problem with ticks. When we moved to Normandy we found a home with a barn that we could convert into stables, 
and a gentler climate. As a result, the horses were happier," says Nicky Bodman.
The Bodmans' property is in Lower Normandy, administratively a separate region to Upper Normandy, and 
generally more rural and bucolic than its neighbour (around Le Havre and Rouen there is some heavy industry).
The area also benefits from varied housing stock, with granite and slate common inland, and half-timbered homes 
nearer the coast. But its attractiveness as a good place to retire has led to an ageing population, or "papy-boom". 
According to the French National Institute of Statistics, 18 per cent of the region's residents are 65 or older, up from 
14 per cent in 1990.
Tricky decision for housebuyers seeking a bargain in Normandy
The upmarket seaside town of Deauville is the region's property hotspot, says Nathalie Garcin, of the Emile Garcin 
estate agency. The pretty town has a wide bathing beach and is sometimes called the "21st arrondissement of 
Paris" because of its popularity with buyers from the French capital.
"The market has been at a virtual standstill since October of last year," says Garcin. "But the return of fine weather 
in the spring, after such a long winter, and the drop in house prices, has encouraged buyers to arrange viewings."
Horseracing and polo are hugely popular in Deauville, which is also where fashion designer Coco Chanel opened a 
boutique in 1913. An increasing number of Russian visitors can now be seen shopping at high-end outlets in the 
town, which has long attracted a well-heeled British, Dutch and German crowd.
Some locals would prefer for it to stay that way. In 2006, campaigners tried to stop Ryanair operating flights from 
the UK to the town's diminutive airport, citing aircraft noise concerns. CityJet runs a seasonal service to Deauville 
from London City airport, but in Normandy low-cost carriers are still notable by their absence.
A mixed brick and half-timbered four-bedroom house, a heated outdoor pool, and 1,550 sq metres of grounds close 
to Deauville's golf course is offered by Emile Garcin for EUR1.57m.
Despite local mortgage interest rates being at historically low levels, PrimeView, a Paris-based economic consulting 
company, predicts that French house prices will fall "at least 30 per cent over the next five to 10 years" from their 
high point in the summer of 2011. In a report drawn up last year, PrimeView noted that France was still "in the 
throes of a very large property bubble". But with the numbers of transactions falling across France - not in the Cote 
d'Azur and central Paris but in many rural areas and small towns - property professionals in the country increasingly 
concede that this might be the calm before the storm.
For potential buyers in places such as the charming Pays d'Auge, a pretty area south of Deauville and famous for 
its cheese and cider, the question is surely: is this the right time to make a move? The once rather frothy property 
market here has already had two lean years and there is no reason to think prices will move in an upwards direction 
anytime soon. The winding country lanes - perfect for walking, cycling or riding - have a timeless feel, but in some 
villages the shops and bars are feeling the pinch and opting to close down as a result of la crise . In Normandy as in 
much of rural France, this could be a summer for finding a house, making a low offer and crossing your fingers.
With its oval-shaped central square ringed by beautiful, half-timbered buildings, Beuvron-en-Auge is one of the 
Pays d'Auge's most attractive villages. Here, a four-bedroom, two-bathroom house - built in 2009 but in a traditional 
style with a steeply sloping roof and exposed beams inside - is on the market for EUR690,000 through the Orpi 
estate agency.
Buyers looking for a property to modernise should budget for about EUR1,000 per sq metre for basic renovation 
including new plumbing, heating and rewiring, says Nathalie Garcin, but luxury fittings and using specialist 
craftsmen could double this figure.
Although Normandy's coastline is generally less dramatic than that of its neighbour, Brittany, the pretty seaside 
resort of Étretat, south of Dieppe, with its shingle beach framed by spectacular cliffs which have eroded into pillars 
and arches, is an exception. The town has a less exclusive feel than Deauville but has an artistic heritage all its 
own, helping it to attract a clutch of impressionist painters such as Claude Monet and, crise or no crise, second-
home buyers today. A six-bedroom, six-bathroom detached house outside Étretat, with 8,000 sq metres of grounds, 
is available for EUR960,000 through Square Habitat. Meanwhile, the average price for a two-bedroom terraced 
fisherman's cottage in the town is about EUR120,000. They may be of modest size but have good potential as 
holiday rentals.

Ryanair faces the prospect of being forced to sell its 30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus following a ruling by the UK's 
Competition Commission.
In a provisional ruling published on Thursday, the commission found allowing Ryanair to maintain its stake in its 
Irish rival could reduce competition on routes between the UK and Ireland and hinder Aer Lingus's ability to be 
acquired or merge with another airline.
"While not giving it control over day-to-day running of its rival, Ryanair's minority shareholding can influence the 
major strategic decisions that could be crucial to Aer Lingus' future as a competitive airline on these and other 
routes," said Simon Polito, the commission's deputy chairman.
The commission found Ryanair's shareholding allowed it to block special resolutions by Aer Lingus and to hinder its 
plans to issue shares and raise capital. Ryanair could also prevent its rival from disposing of its valuable slots at 
Heathrow, said the ruling.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, described the commission's ruling as "bizarre and manifestly wrong".
"The commission's finding that Ryanair's shareholding obstructs Aer Lingus' ability to attract other airlines was 
disproved by Etihad's purchase of a 3 per cent stake and the evidence submitted by other large European Union 
airlines, which confirmed that Ryanair's shareholding was not a barrier to other airlines acquiring a stake in Aer 
Lingus," he said.
Ryanair faces regulatory pressure to sell stake in Aer Lingus
Potential remedies published in the latest ruling include forcing the airline to sell all or part of its 29.8 per cent stake 
as well as imposing safeguards on Ryanair to protect competition.
The ruling marks the latest blow delivered by regulators to Ryanair's attempt to control Aer Lingus, which competes 
with it in the Irish marketplace.
In February Brussels blocked Ryanair's third bid in eight years to take over Aer Lingus, ruling that the proposed 
transaction would increase fares for passengers and create a monopoly on 46 UK-Irish routes.
The commission has begun a consultation on the findings, which is scheduled to close on June 20.
Mr Polito said the commission was particularly concerned Ryanair could interfere with Aer Lingus' ability to be 
acquired by, merge with, or acquire another airline.
The commission is expected to publish its final report by July 11.
The commission has the power to order companies to divest a minority stake if it finds the holding enables the 
owner to influence the behaviour and policies of a target company in a way that harms competition.
In 2010 BSkyB was forced to sell 10 per cent of a 17.9 per cent minority stake that it held in ITV when the 
commission found the shareholding would give rise to a substantial lessening of competition.
Aer Lingus said it welcomed the provisional findings by the commission.
"Aer Lingus looks forward to continuing to assist the UK Competition Commission in its investigation into the anti-
competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding," it said in a statement.
Mr O'Leary, however, said UK taxpayers interests would be better served if the commission investigated British 
Airways takeovers of BMI, Iberia and Vueling.

The all-too-stately dance between Ryanair, Aer Lingus and antitrust regulators took a few more shuffling steps 
forward on Thursday. A provisional decision by the UK competition authorities that Europe's biggest low-cost airline 
should reduce its holding in Irish rival Aer Lingus, because this allows it to influence the latter's strategy, was almost 
as predictable as Ryanair's declaration that the findings were "manifestly wrong". Both carriers - and other 
interested parties - can now make further submissions to the UK Competition Commission, after which the agency 
will issue a final conclusion in July.
No one should expect a quickstep thereafter. Even if the CC's view is unaltered, Ryanair executives have indicated 
that their legal advice is that the carrier cannot be forced to dispose of its Aer Lingus stake while an appeal against 
the European Commisison's earlier block on a merger between the two carriers is ongoing. In short, resolving this 
tangle could take many months, if not years. Lawyers will doubtless get richer.
But it would be a mistake to think that, because Ryanair has long since written down the value of its near-30 per 
cent Aer Lingus holding, the financial stakes in this seven-year-old tussle are no longer significant. The Irish 
government, with a quarter of Aer Lingus' shares, is also a potential seller. Without Ryanair sitting on the register in 
a weighty fashion, it is easy to see that Aer Lingus's chances of combining with another carrier to achieve greater 
scale could be enhanced. And the idea of using Dublin Airport's spare capacity, for example, as a base from which 
to feed long-haul flights into Europe is not entirely fanciful. Sadly, though, getting from here to there may require a 
lot more fancy footwork.

European semiconductor stocks were boosted on Thursday after a positive outlook on the sector from analysts at 
JPMorgan.
"Semiconductor stocks are up strongly in the second half and inventory data looks supportive of a continuing up-
cycle," the broker said in a note to clients.
Shares in STMicroelectronics, the Franco-Italian group, rose 2.1 per cent to EUR7.34 after JPMorgan named it as a 
key pick in the sector as it was beginning to benefit from both cost cuts and the improving business cycle. The 
broker also named Germany's Infineon Technologies, which rose 3.3 per cent to EUR6.61.
Thanks also to gains for a number of financials and UK-listed mining stocks, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 closed 0.3 per 
cent higher at 1,227.16 - putting in a resilient performance after a 5 per cent rout of Tokyo stocks in the Asia 
session.
"Over the last couple of weeks, the negativity in Asia has followed through to the European session, but we're not 
seeing this today as investors sit on the sidelines and see how things play out," said Craig Erlam at Alpari UK.
The day's batch of eurozone data were also supportive as economic sentiment within the single currency bloc 
continued to improve.
There were some strong performances in the insurance sector. Germany's Allianz climbed 2.8 per cent to 
EUR121.80 after Nomura raised its rating to buy from neutral and its target price to EUR140 from EUR103. Allianz 
was "firing on all cylinders" the broker said, with earnings growth being driven by all business segments.
Chip stocks help lift European indices
Dutch insurer Aegon climbed 4.5 per cent to EUR5.38 after it completed the conversion of its preferred shares.
Airlines were buoyed by data from the International Air Transport Association that showed global passenger traffic 
rose 3.2 per cent in April, from last year. Germany's Lufthansa rose 4.4 per cent to EUR16.84, while Air France-
KLM added 2.4 per cent to EUR7.68.
Ryanair climbed 1 per cent to EUR6.96 even after it came under regulatory pressure from the UK Competition 
Commission to sell its 30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, whose shares added 1.3 per cent to EUR1.55.
Linde, the German industrial gases group, fell 2.2 per cent to EUR149.05 after Citigroup cut its rating to neutral 
from buy.

European markets reversed much of their May gains this week as investors sold out of equities amid global growth 
concerns.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 lost 1.7 per cent over the week to close at 1,226.58. Banks were among the most unloved 
stocks.
"Uncertainty on the Chinese economy and global monetary policy triggered turmoil in the markets - but we see this 
as a correction, not the start of a new trend," Danske Bank analysts wrote in a note to clients.
In Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank fell 6.8 per cent to EUR34.95 against a 1.1 per cent loss on the Xetra Dax.
In Spain, shares in Banco de Sabadell slipped 7.5 per cent to EUR1.45, while the benchmark Ibex 35 closed down 
3.7 per cent over the week.
Italian lender Intesa Sanpaolo slumped 6.4 per cent to EUR1.38, against a 4 per cent fall on the FTSE MIB.
Investors sent shares in Metro rallying 8.3 per cent to EUR26.90 after analysts at Morgan Stanley upgraded their 
rating in the German retail group for the first time in nearly a decade.
Elan shares also received a fillip after the Irish pharmaceutical group's board unanimously rejected Royal Pharma's 
$6.5bn bid.
Royal Pharma, a US private equity group that buys royalty streams, previously made a $5.7bn takeover bid which 
Elan called a "misplaced or naive offer".
European lenders unloved amid growth fears
Investors gave their vote of confidence, sending the shares up 7.3 per cent to EUR9.52.
Record full-year profits from Ryanair sent shares in the budget airline up 6.5 per cent to EUR6.74.

EasyJet to buy Gatwick slots from Flybe
EasyJet to buy Gatwick slots from Flybe

EasyJet is seeking to strengthen its grip on Gatwick by agreeing to pay £20m for take-off and landing slots at the 
UK's second largest airport that are held by Flybe.
EasyJet has overtaken British Airways to become the biggest airline at Gatwick, with an estimated 40 per cent 
market share, and these slots should enable the airline to defend itself against encroachment by the UK flag carrier, 
Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair.
Europe's second largest low-cost carrier by revenue, which joined the FTSE 100 in March, plans to use some of the 
Flybe slots from the summer of 2014 to provide additional flights on its most popular routes out of Gatwick, which 
include Alicante, Faro and Malaga.
The proposed Flybe slot transaction - announced on Thursday - is consistent with plans by Carolyn McCall, 
easyJet's chief executive, to focus some of the airline's expansion on major airports with limited capacity.
The company is considering placing a large aircraft order soon and Ms McCall said last week that easyJet could 
grow at its top 20 airports at the expense of European flag carriers and other airlines that do not have a low-cost 
business model.
James Hollins, analyst at Investec, said: "This [proposed slot transaction] will ... enhance easyJet's [market] share 
dominance at Gatwick."
Although Gatwick - in contrast to Heathrow - is not operating at full capacity, the UK's second largest airport does 
have operational bottlenecks, mainly in the morning.
EasyJet to buy Gatwick slots from Flybe
EasyJet should therefore benefit from how eight of the 25 pairs of take-off and landing slots it is planning to buy 
from Flybe are for early morning flights.
Flybe, the lossmaking UK regional airline that has issued several profit warnings since its 2010 flotation, is pulling 
out of Gatwick next April and said it would reinvest some of the £20m of proceeds from the slot sale in its remaining 
159 routes.
The deal must be approved by Flybe's shareholders, but management decided to sell these Gatwick slots after the 
Civil Aviation Authority, the main aviation regulator, in January rejected the airline's complaint about how the airport 
restructured its aeronautical charges paid by carriers.
From 2011, Gatwick's summer charges increased by 63 per cent, while winter fees were reduced to zero.
Flybe had complained to the CAA that the changes unreasonably discriminated against it and other operators of 
small aircraft at Gatwick.
Jim French, Flybe's chief executive, said the company could not bear Gatwick's "punitive rises" in aeronautical 
charges, particularly when the carrier also had to contend with the government's air passenger duty.
On Thursday, Flybe announced further details of its effort to return its UK business to profit, saying that a planned 
target of £25m of annual cost savings in 2013-14 had now been increased to £30m.
It added the airline had so far cut its workforce by 22 per cent to 2,140 and that further headcount reductions would 
now be sought.
The sale of the Gatwick slots, plus other measures, are supposed to finance the turnround plan, including 
redundancies.

The average ticket price last year on a Ryanair flight was about the same as the cost of 20 cappuccinos. More 
precisely, it worked out at EUR48, up 6 per cent year-on-year - or perhaps a little more on an underlying basis since 
that includes bag charges, and fliers are finally wising up to the weighty additional costs which luggage entails. 
Passenger numbers grew 5 per cent, which the low-cost carrier thinks will moderate to 3 per cent in 2013/14. It also 
forecasts net profits of EUR570m-EUR600m for the current year. At the top end, that implies a 5 per cent increase 
from 2012/13's EUR570m.
Yet, in contrast to these seemingly modest growth numbers, Ryanair shares have risen 85 per cent over the past 12 
months, way above the one-third increase in the Euro Stoxx index. That leaves an obvious question for investors: 
how much upside remains?
In terms of the immediate future, Ryanair has been cautious so often that the market tends to look well beyond 
management's own forecasts. After all, a year ago, Ryanair talked of 2012/13 net profits of EUR400m-EUR440m, 
and the actual out-turn was 30 per cent higher. Moreover, on the sales front, even management expects that 
ancillary revenues - now almost a quarter of the total and including reserved seating fees - will grow 9 per cent in 
2013/14. Ryanair also plans to ground fewer planes this winter (60 versus 80). Cost controls, meanwhile, remain 
exemplary, with a per-passenger figure (excluding fuel) of EUR29, or half that at rival easyJet. Fuel, too, is 
moderating.
Longer-term, the general capacity discipline on intra-Europe flights at present, coupled with airline consolidation, 
throws up expansion opportunities which Ryanair has a solid record of seizing. So net profits of EUR625m-
EUR630m in 2013/14, say, would imply a 15 times earnings multiple. That is pricier than the airline's seats, but not 
excessive.

Ryanair is aiming to achieve further growth at the expense of European flag carriers in the next five years, as it 
announced a 16 per cent increase in underlying operating profit for 2012-13.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue announced it would use a planned purchase of 175 Boeing passenger 
jets to expand in Germany, Scandinavia and central Europe, and told investors a third special dividend could be 
paid in 2014-15.
Howard Millar, Ryanair's finance director, said the company would continue to expand on European short-haul 
routes while competitors - including Iberia, Air France, Lufthansa, Air Berlin, LOT Polish Airlines and SAS - were 
engaged in restructurings that periodically involved capacity cuts.
Mr Millar predicted that Ryanair would increase its addressable market share of European short-haul passengers 
from 15 per cent now to 20 per cent by 2018-19, saying it could replace Air Berlin as the second-largest carrier in 
Germany.
He added Ryanair would look at all growth opportunities, including flying migrant workers from Bulgaria and 
Romania to other parts of the EU, when workers from these two countries secured full employment rights in 
member states next year. "Our growth in Poland has been driven [by] migrant workers going back and forth [to their 
home country]," he said.
Ryanair paid a maiden special dividend worth EUR500m in 2010, with a second distributed last year, and Mr Millar 
said a further payment to shareholders was possible in 2014-15. The company's shares closed up almost 7 per 
cent at EUR6.75.
Ryanair seeks more growth amid flag carrier cuts as profit soars
Like easyJet, Ryanair has benefited from consumers turning from European flag carriers to budget airlines during 
the economic downturn.
Ryanair reported revenue of EUR4.9bn for the year to March 31, up 13 per cent compared with the previous year, 
as the number of passengers carried by the Irish airline rose 5 per cent to 79.3m.
The company's average fare increased 6 per cent to EUR48, while ancillary revenue - charges beyond the basic 
flight ticket - climbed 20 per cent to EUR1.1bn. This was partly driven by Ryanair giving passengers the opportunity 
to reserve their seats for an additional fee.
Operating profit - excluding one-off items that boosted earnings in 2011-12 - increased by 16 per cent to 
EUR718.2m. Net income rose 2 per cent to EUR569.3m.
Ryanair expects to report net income of between EUR570m and EUR600m for 2013-14, partly because of higher 
costs involving fuel and airport charges. However, analysts noted that the company has a habit of issuing 
conservative guidance.
Mr Millar confirmed Ryanair would continue with court appeals against the European Commission's prohibition in 
February of its proposed takeover of Aer Lingus, and a UK regulatory inquiry into its 30 per cent stake in the Irish 
flag carrier.

Ryanair warned that higher airport charges, soaring fuel costs and slowing demand from Europe would bite into 
future profit growth, even as the low-cost airline reported record full-year numbers.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the Irish budget carrier, on Monday cautioned: "With almost zero yield visibility 
into the second half, and the EU-wide recession, we expect that there will continue to be downward pressure on 
yields which will dampen full-year profit growth.
"Unit costs will increase primarily due to rising oil prices, a 3 per cent growth in sector length, and unjustified higher 
Eurocontrol and Spanish airport charges."
However, the complaints came amid a backdrop of buoyant revenues and pre-tax profit from the Dublin-based 
airline, which has taken advantage in capacity cuts or restructurings at rivals including Air Berlin, International 
Airlines Group's Iberia, Alitalia, SAS, LOT Polish Airlines and Lufthansa.
Ryanair reported full-year pre-tax profit had climbed 3 per cent year on year to EUR650.9m, from revenues that 
rose 11 per cent to EUR4.88bn. Sales were boosted by a jump in ancillary revenues, such as luggage check-in fees 
and reserved seating charges, rising from EUR886m to EUR1.1bn.
Shares in Ryanair rose 5 per cent to EUR6.64 in early Dublin trading, valuing the company's equity at almost 
EUR10bn.
Ryanair cautious despite record year as profits hit EUR651m
Passenger numbers climbed 5 per cent to 79.5m, as recession-hit travellers turned to the no-frills airline. The 
numbers were also boosted by Easter - a traditionally busy period for travellers - falling within the financial year to 
March 31, instead of later into April.
A EUR1.9bn fuel bill, up from EUR1.7bn the previous year, drove operating costs 12 per cent higher to EUR4.1bn.
Diluted earnings per share edged up from 34.03 cents to 39.33 cents, and there was no dividend.
"Ryanair remains by some distance the lowest-cost producer in the industry, with a renewed growth story and 
underlying cash generation implying considerable medium-term upside," said analysts at Davy Research.
Earlier this year, Ryanair confirmed that it would purchase 175 Boeing 737 narrow-body passenger jets, to be 
delivered between 2014 and 2018, in a deal worth $16bn.
Rival budget carrier easyJet said last week that it was on the verge of following suit and placing a placing a large 
aircraft order, insisting there was a solid growth case for the purchase based on poaching market share from 
Europe's flag carriers.

Another sharp price fall in precious metal prices - as investors switch out of haven assets and into equities - has left 
London's gold and silver stocks lagging a sustained rally on the FTSE 100.
With silver prices down by as much as 9 per cent in Asian trade as operators of exchange traded funds continued to 
sell their physical holdings, Fresnillo was among the biggest fallers.
The Mexican miner is the world's biggest silver producer by volume and its stock lost 2 per cent to £10.46.
Polymetal, the Russian precious metals producer, was 1.7 per cent weaker at 623p.
Wider mining stocks also drifted lower after their recent advance. Rio Tinto fell 1.2 per cent to £28.65. Vedanta 
Resources was 1.1 per cent weaker £12.58.
Controversial miner ENRC was the biggest single faller after one of its major shareholders, fellow FTSE 100 miner 
and compatriot Kazakhmys, signalled it could sell its stake.
ENRC has been at the centre of a series of worries about its ability to meet the corporate governance standards 
which go along with its London listing. Its three billionaire founders said last month they were considering taking it 
private by buying out minority investors in a move supported by the Kazakhstan government, a major shareholder.
The independent committee set up by ENRC's board to review the offer made for the company said it was too low 
in a statement released this morning.
ENRC's shares fell 3.4 per cent to 262.5p.
Precious metal stocks hit by silver's slide
The best single gainer was budget airline EasyJet, which took off after record earnings from its main rival Ryanair 
outweighed a cloudier outlook statement from the Irish carrier. EasyJet was 4.9 per cent higher at £12.46, while 
Ryanair was 6.7 per cent stronger at EUR6.76 in Dublin.
Overall, the FTSE 100 ticked 0.2 per cent higher to 6,734.02 a rise of 11 points.
It took London's main index to its best level since October 2007, just before the worst days of the financial crisis.

European shares moved higher aided by strong results from Ryanair.
More income from optional charges such as checked baggage lifted the Irish budget carrier's net profit 13 per cent 
to EUR569m, beating forecasts.
The shares rose 6.9 per cent to EUR6.77 for the second biggest rise on the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index.
The results saw the sector gain as well - Lufthansa added 3.6 per cent to EUR16.07 and Air France-KLM rose 4 per 
cent to EUR7.71.
Led by airlines, the Eurofirst advanced 0.3 per cent to 1,252.1, moving closer to a five-year high.
Rheinmetall put on 4 per cent to EUR39.62. The maker of car parts was upgraded to "hold" by Deutsche Bank, 
which said European demand for automobiles might improve this year.
Deutsche Telekom gained after, in Britain, Vodafone pulled out of the running to provide a mobile service to fixed-
line operator BT, ending a nine-year arrangement. The group's British unit, jointly owned with France Telecom, 
remains in the running. Deutsche gained 2.2 per cent to EUR9.41 and France Telecom was up 0.8 per cent to 
EUR8.30.
The Xetra Dax gained 0.7 per cent to 8,455.8 in Frankfurt, the CAC 40 added 0.5 per cent to 4,022.9 in Paris and 
the FTSE MIB lost 0.6 per cent to 17,506.9 in Milan.
Ryanair lifted by gain in net profit
Danone gained 1.8 per cent to EUR59.17 after it announced a move into China. The French food group said it 
would invest EUR325m in two joint ventures. It said it would take a 4 per cent stake in Mengniu, China's biggest 
milk producer.
Elan gained 1.9 per cent to EUR9.05. The Irish drugmaker agreed to buy two private drug companies and spin off 
one of its drugs.
Commerzbank rose 8.8 per cent to EUR8.50. The bank last week launched a heavily discounted EUR2.5bn rights 
issue.
ING, the Dutch bank, gained 3.1 per cent to EUR7.34 after Citigroup upgraded its target price.
Carmakers gained and the sector was the best-performing Eurofirst sub-index. Peugeot rose 5.8 per cent to 
EUR7.56, bringing its year-to-date rise to 50.6 per cent and Volkswagen was up 3.2 per cent to EUR173.85.

- Crunch time for JPMorgan Chase comes on in Tampa, Florida, where shareholders will decide whether to install 
an independent chairman and re-elect directors, writes Tom Braithwaite.
Early voting suggests Jamie Dimon, chief executive and chairman, will hold on to his dual roles in spite of calls for 
more accountability in the wake of the "London Whale" episode.
The Week Ahead: May 20 - May 26
The board, particularly members of the risk policy committee, are braced for significant protest votes against their 
re-election, marshalled by a group of corporate governance activists.
Last year the company incurred a 40 per cent vote demanding that Mr Dimon lose his role as chairman. That vote 
came shortly after the bank revealed significant losses from a trader, nicknamed the London Whale, betting on 
credit derivatives.
However, it was only after last year's meeting that the full magnitude of the affair became clear, with the bank 
acknowledging more than $6bn in losses and multiple probes from regulators over this issue and many others, 
ranging from credit cards to alleged manipulation of California's electricity.
Directors led by Lee Raymond, the former chief executive of ExxonMobil, have defended the current board and its 
structure. But activists including the CtW Investment Group, which advises union pension funds, say Mr Dimon 
needs more checks and balances.
-Just weeks after Vodafone warned of a "lean" year for dividends from Verizon Wireless, the US wireless operator it 
jointly owns with Verizon, it was revealed last week that the UK-based mobile operator will receive a dividend worth 
£2.1bn from the venture, writes Robert Budden.
Shareholders in Vodafone will be looking for clarity on how the mobile operator plans to use this cash. Some 
analysts are predicting it will plough some of it back into a new share buyback scheme after the current buyback 
expires in July. Others expect it may hold on to the cash for future investment.
Analysts are forecasting group revenue declines of around 4 per cent for the year to the end of March amid tough 
markets in Europe. Consensus expectations for adjusted earnings per share are 15.39p, against 14.91p last time 
with pre-tax profit expected at £10.1bn, a rise of 1.7 per cent on the previous year.

- Two burning questions could be settled by FirstGroup when the rail and bus operator unveils its full-year results, 
writes Mark Odell.
Investors are waiting for the company to clarify its dividend policy after management signalled at the time of the 
interims that it could abandon its pledge to increase its full-year payout by 7 per cent. Some analysts believe the 
group could cut the dividend sharply, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecasting a drop to 10p per share from 
23.7p a year earlier.
The possibility of a rights issue still hangs over the stock. Management has not ruled it out but insisted there is no 
urgency: the ongoing disposal programme and possible dividend cut could give the group headroom.
Investors will be hoping there are further signs of improvement at the two ailing bus businesses - its US school bus 
operations and the UK bus division.
Revenues are forecast to come in slightly higher at around £6.9bn with pre-tax profits reduced sharply by 
expectional charges to £96.8m, according to Investec.-The PC industry's worst start to the year on record does not 
bode well for Hewlett-Packard when the world's biggest PC maker releases second-quarter earnings to the end of 
April, writes Chris Nuttall.
Global PC shipments fell 14 per cent in the first quarter, according to the IDC research firm, the worst drop since it 
began tracking them in 1994.
HP's own shipments were down 24 per cent year-on-year at 12m units, although it held on to the number one spot 
with a 15.7 per cent market share, ahead of Lenovo's 15.3 per cent.
There was equally bad news when the Gartner research firm came out with first-quarter figures for the high-margin 
servers HP sells, showing its rival Dell was eating into its leading market share. HP's share shrank from 29.2 per 
cent to 25 per cent, while Dell's increased from 21.5 to 22.2 per cent.
HP is predicting earnings will be essentially flat compared with the previous quarter, at 80 to 82 cents a share.

-Investors will be watching to see whether SABMiller's glass is half full or half empty when the world's second-
biggest brewer reports full-year results, writes Louise Lucas.
Consensus forecasts call for a 14 per cent rise in group earnings before interest, tax and amortisation to $6.4bn, 
boosted by the first full-year inclusion of Foster's of Australia.
Gloom reigns in Europe, where cash-strapped drinkers are trading down and sales are expected to dip; fortunes are 
only a tad better in North America where they are flatlining.
Even the brighter - and to be fair, bigger - stars in SABMiller's firmament have hiccups: foreign exchange is set to 
weigh on South Africa.
In Latin America, the biggest profit pool, the economic slowdown may temper growth. However, the group's ability 
to raise pricing in some of these markets and encourage drinkers to trade up to higher margin drinks is expected to 
help cushion some of this.-United Utilities kicks off the reporting round for the UK's listed water companies well 
aware of calls from the industry's regulator that the sector should he looking at ways of sharing the unexpected 
gains of inflation-proofed price increases and low borrowing costs with customers, writes Michael Kavanagh.
Analysts are expecting few surprises after it guided in March that performance was in line with expectations, with 
revenues anticipated to advance from £1.56bn to £1.64bn and operating profits to be slightly ahead of last year's 
£592m.
But the real attention will be on whether there is any movement on a takeover approach for its peer Severn Trent 
made and rejected last week.
That approach raised Severn Trent's share price by nearly a fifth on the day and also lifted the shares of United 
Utilities and Pennon, parent company of South West Water - the only other UK water and sewerage companies of 
scale that remain publicly listed.

EasyJet boosted by sun-seeking Britons

EasyJet has offered a rosy outlook for its full-year numbers, as sun-seeking Britons fleeing the UK's extended 
winter helped the budget airline almost halve its interim pre-tax loss.
The low-cost carrier, which was recently promoted to the FTSE 100 index, on Wednesday reported a pre-tax loss of 
£61m in the six months to March 31, down from a loss of £112m in the same period the previous year.
EasyJet - Europe's second-largest budget airline by passenger numbers behind Ryanair - regularly loses money in 
the first half, with the more lucrative second-half summer season compensating for cuts in services and demand 
over the winter.
For the full year, analysts at Deutsche Bank expect easyJet to record a pre-tax profit of £401m.
Carolyn McCall, easyJet chief executive, said: "EasyJet delivered a strong first-half performance, demonstrating the 
company's structural advantage in the European short-haul market against both legacy and low-cost competition, 
and a continuing resilience against a challenging European macroeconomic environment."
The orange-branded airline on Wednesday reported total revenues up 9.3 per cent year on year to £1.6bn, and 
revenue per seat increased 5.8 per cent to £53.39, buoyed by strong bookings in the lead-up to the busy Easter 
period.
The average load factor - a measure of how well easyJet fills its aircraft - increased by 1.7 percentage points year 
on year to 88.6 per cent, while capacity edged up 3.3 per cent to 30m seats during the period.
EasyJet boosted by sun-seeking Britons
However, higher charges from airports in Spain and Italy are likely to push up its costs per seat some 4 per cent in 
the second half.
Like rival Ryanair, easyJet has increased revenues during the European downturn, as cash-strapped consumers 
opted for savings over comfort for short-haul flights.
The Luton-based airline - which this month appointed John Barton to take over from Sir Mike Rake as its chairman - 
has also targeted business travellers, at a time when flag-carriers such as Air France-KLM and Lufthansa are 
cutting capacity on short-haul routes.
However, the airline offered no further clarity on a large order for new aircraft. EasyJet is considering the purchase 
of up to 200 next-generation narrow-body jets from Airbus or Boeing that feature more fuel-efficient engines, as a 
replacement for most of its 214-strong fleet.
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the airline's founder and largest shareholder, is vehemently opposed to buying more jets in 
favour of a return of cash to investors.
Should the easyJet board decides to press ahead with the order, the first aircraft are likely to be delivered in 2017, 
the company said.
EasyJet shares rose 1.5 per cent to £11.47 in early London trading.

Wheeee . . . When a stock has more than trebled in 18 months solely on trading grounds, investors have to ask 
when the trajectory will flatten out. In easyJet's case, the answer was not on Wednesday. News of a near-halved 
loss, at £61m before tax, in the six months to the end of March and the promise of improved returns for the full year, 
lifted the low-cost carrier's shares 6 per cent.
EasyJet has not been alone in its stellar path. Over the same period, Ryanair's shares have almost doubled, while 
those of Norwegian Air Shuttle have outflown everyone. This reflects rare capacity discipline in the intra-European 
market as legacy carriers (Air France-KLM, Lufthansa) prune back lossmaking short-haul operations, and weaker 
rivals (Malev, Spanair) fold. On easyJet routes, competitor capacity fell 3 per cent, year on year, in the six months 
just ended. That mirrored a similar drop in the second half of easyJet's 2011-12 financial year. The carrier, by 
contrast, increased its own capacity by 3.3 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively. The competitor decline may ease 
off to about 1 per cent this summer, but easyJet still expects a 3.5 per cent rise.
Can the trend continue? easyJet route network development has been shrewd. Focusing on the likes of France and 
Switzerland, it avoids too much head-to-head competition with Ryanair. Executives also argue that non-low cost 
point-to-point traffic at its top 20 airports amounts to 86m seats - almost double easyJet's existing capacity there - 
and that these are up for grabs. That may over-egg matters somewhat: slot constraints and regulatory costs may 
not make all this traffic attractive. Still, with legacy retrenchment ongoing and certain new market prospects (Russia, 
Scandinavia), opportunities are not exhausted. Shares, on 15 times 2012-13 earnings, aren't a steal. But they may 
not be ready to level off just yet.

THE PROBLEM
After Charles Ramsey helped free three women in Cleveland, Ohio, he told reporters he was "eating a McDonald's" 
when he had heard one of the hostages screaming. The company tweeted in support. How do brands get the 
balance right on a sensitive story?
THE ADVICE
The academic: Paul A. Argenti
I'm sure the last thing that McDonald's social media team expected last week was becoming embroiled in a 
kidnapping case in Cleveland. But the company did a great job of balancing what was a very sticky situation.
In the end, it gave the hero in this case - a customer - the equivalent of a social media "shoutout" with its "way to 
go" tweet.
By saying it would "be in touch", the company showed that it, like everyone else, are both listening carefully and 
grateful for what he did. This was done with lots of thought and care by McDonald's, and it shows.

Can you build your brand on the back of a news story?
It's certainly a dilemma for brands whether and how to jump on topical bandwagons - particularly if they involve 
trauma or tragedy. And in an all-seeing digital world, mistakes never go away - they escalate at a scale and speed 
that can destroy reputations. You have to judge the connection and relevance finely, in line with your brand's 
values.
Low-cost Irish airline Ryanair is a particular stranger to the taste police, but the strength of that brand ironically lies 
in its cheapness all round. Opticians Specsavers and Lynx, the men's grooming products brand famous for its racy 
ads, manage to combine wit and topicality, even in risqué situations such as MP's expenses and Prince Harry's 
social life - again, in line with their respective brands. Assess before you press that send button.

The PR: Mark Borkowski
High-profile brands are damned if they do and damned if they don't. In an economy where events are driven by 
social media, brands try to create and exploit shareable stories.
The rules of traditional public relations have been disrupted. Much-hyped techniques such as newsjacking, whereby 
you inject your angles into breaking news, in real time to generate media coverage, have become increasingly 
common.
McDonald's is comfortable with social media and its cryptic tweet suggests the company is relaxed about taking 
advantage of such an opportunity. It recognises the power of a mass audience and its social team grabbed the 
moment. It will be able to strategically switch if Mr Ramsey's exotic backstory is not fit for PR purpose.

Byline: Daniel Dombey in Istanbul
Body
Shares in Pegasus Airlines, Turkey's answer to Europe's low-cost carriers, made their trading debut on Friday, in 
the latest sign of the ambition of the country's aviation sector.
The sale of the 34.5 per cent stake, valuing Pegasus at just over $1bn, was Turkey's largest initial public offering for 
two and a half years. Shortly before the end of trading the stock had risen by more than 2 per cent on the day. Most 
of the investors in the IPO came from outside Turkey, with many of them hailing from the UK.
The listing comes as Borsa Istanbul - as Istanbul Stock Exchange was rebranded this month - is seeking to 
heighten its profile and increase its effectiveness in raising capital. While initial and secondary public offerings 
garnered just over $3bn last year, BGC Partners in Istanbul expects the total to reach $7bn this year and $5bn in 
2014.
The IPO also came in the wake of a series of large-scale purchases by Turkey's airlines, notably Pegasus's 
December announcement that it would buy up to 100 Airbus narrow bodied A320 series aircraft - a transaction it 
said would be worth $12bn based on list prices, although in practice airlines often receive substantial discounts.
Meanwhile, Turkish Airlines, the country's 49 per cent state-owned carrier, is also rapidly expanding, carrying out a 
series of multibillion dollar aircraft purchases of its own, including up to 117 A320 series aircraft, while increasing its 
reach to 99 countries - more, it says, than any other airline.
Next month the Turkish government is due to hold a tender for the construction and operation of a new Istanbul 
airport to serve as a hub for Turkish Airlines. With an initial capacity of 90m passengers a year, the airport is 
intended to be one of the biggest in the world.
Pegasus Airlines listing takes to air
But Pegasus, which intends to use the funds raised by the IPO to fund its expansion and raise its international 
profile, compares itself with other low cost carriers such as Ryanair and EasyJet.
Because regulations restrict EU carriers from flying to Turkey from outside their hubs, Pegasus has little competition 
with either EasyJet or Ryanair, instead focusing on cheaper flights within Turkey and from Istanbul's second airport 
of Sabiha Gokcen to foreign destinations.
By offering connecting flights between domestic and international locations, it styles itself a low-cost network carrier.
The group, headed by Ali Sabanci, a disaffected scion of the Sabanci family, one of the most prominent in Turkish 
business, is now planning to expand its network to take advantage of Turkey's location close to the Middle East, 
north Africa and Russia.
"Geographically, there's an advantage over European carriers," said Selim Kunter at EkspresInvest in Istanbul. 
"Flying four to five hours in a narrow-bodied aircraft you can get to more countries from Istanbul than from 
anywhere else in Europe."
Barclays and Is Yatirim of Turkey acted as coordinators and joint bookrunners for the IPO.

Operating losses at Aer Lingus increased sharply in the first quarter of 2013 because of weaker trading in the UK, 
higher fuel and airport charges, and start-up costs related to the airline's leasing strategy.
The Irish airline said on Thursday it would cut another 100 jobs to protect profitability for the rest of the year as it 
had limited visibility over booking patterns for the second half of 2013.
Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus chief executive, said: "Trends identified in the first quarter 2013 including higher 
airport charges, the strength of the long haul and the softness in [sterling] and our UK market have the potential to 
remain a feature for the rest of the year."
The company said it forecast 2013 operating profit, before exceptional items, to be broadly in line with last year, 
which was EUR69.1m.
In the first three months of the year Aer Lingus reported an operating loss before exceptional items of EUR45.5m, 
up from EUR36.1m in the same quarter 2012. The first quarter of the year is traditionally lossmaking for the airline.
Operating costs rose 6.1 per cent, which reflected increased fuel and airport charges, weaker trading in the UK and 
a EUR3.6m charge related to the companies "wet lease" deal with Virgin Atlantic. Under these arrangements the 
airline provides planes and crews to operate on a route under contract with other airlines.
In March Aer Lingus started services on behalf of Virgin on domestic UK routes connecting London Heathrow with 
Manchester, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. In April the company agreed the "wet lease" of three Boeing 757 aircraft to 
operate on Northern Atlantic services starting in early 2014.
Weak UK trading weighs on Aer Lingus
Aer Lingus is increasingly seeking opportunities to grow outside its traditional Irish market where it faces stiff 
competition from Ryanair. It has pinpointed "wet-leasing" as an opportunity.
Revenues at Aer Lingus increased 3.3 per cent to EUR259.7m in the first quarter of 2013, compared with the same 
quarter last year.

International Airlines Group is poised to secure control of Vueling, the Spanish low-cost airline, in a move that 
should provide the group with an important source of growth.
IAG, parent of British Airways and Iberia, is paying EUR123.5m to increase its stake in Barcelona-based Vueling 
from 45.9 per cent to 90.5 per cent.
IAG said on Tuesday that Vueling would be a standalone company within the group. "We plan to retain Vueling's 
current business model and management structure and its strong base in Barcelona," said Willie Walsh, IAG chief 
executive.
Some analysts believe IAG may use Vueling on some of Iberia's short-haul routes if a planned restructuring of the 
lossmaking Spanish flag carrier fails to restore it to profit.
People close to IAG said in January that Vueling could form part of IAG's efforts to compete more effectively 
against Ryanair and easyJet, Europe's largest low-cost carriers by revenue. IAG could seek cost savings by 
eventually using Vueling to provide some short-haul services currently done by British Airways and Iberia.
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Espirito Santo, said that by taking control of Vueling, IAG could transfer flying that is 
currently done elsewhere in the group to the low-cost carrier.
"It is likely to be point-to-point short-haul flying currently done by Iberia, where it is competing head to head with 
Ryanair or easyJet," he added.
IAG poised to gain control of Vueling
IAG last November offered to pay EUR7 a share for the Vueling equity that it does not already own.
Vueling's board rejected this tender offer, but recommended improved terms of EUR9.25 per share.
Vueling would remain a listed company with a 9.5 per cent free float because, even though IAG is due to secure 
90.5 per cent of the Barcelona carrier's equity, it does not gain the right to buy out the remaining shareholders.
Iberia secured its 45.9 per cent stake in Vueling in 2009 when the Barcelona carrier merged with Clickair, which had 
been established by the Spanish flag carrier.
Vueling started flying in 2004, and ran up losses in its early years, but has been reporting operating profits since 
2009.
It was notable last year for strong growth in capacity and earnings. Vueling reported revenue of EUR1.1bn for 2012, 
up 28 per cent compared to 2011, as seating capacity rose 17 per cent. Earnings before interest and tax almost 
tripled to EUR33.2m.
Vueling also has a robust balance sheet: it had net cash of EUR339.3m at December 31.
With the Spanish economy in recession, Vueling has been seeking growth elsewhere in continental Europe. It 
carried 14.8m passengers last year, an increase of 20 per cent, and is now the third-largest airline at Paris Orly and 
Rome Fiumicino airports.

Olympic Air, Greece's biggest airline by passenger numbers, is again facing serious regulatory turbulence in its 
second attempt to buy local rival Aegean Airlines.
The European Commission, which vetoed the proposed tie-up in 2011, on Tuesday launched a full antitrust probe 
into the latest takeover attempt, saying it would likely give the merged entity a monopoly on multiple routes.
The strength of the concerns raised is a serious setback for the airlines, who were hoping the dire state of the 
Greek economy and the parlous position of lossmaking Aegean would help justify clearance from Brussels.
Olympic offered a package of concessions to win approval - including capping some fares on domestic routes - but 
the Commission found them to be insufficient. The decision to launch a full probe gives Brussels until September to 
decide whether to allow the deal.
Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, said: "We have the duty to ensure that Greek passengers and 
people visiting Greece can travel at competitive air fares, even more so during challenging economic times."
In their preliminary investigation into the deal, officials found the combined group would wield "a monopoly on the 
routes from Athens to Chania, Santorini, Mytilene, Corfu, Alexandroupolis and Kos, to the detriment of ticket prices 
and service level offered to passengers travelling on these routes."
EU probes Olympic move on Aegean Airlines
The Commission also harbours concern that the number of monopoly routes would rise because Cyprus Air, the 
main competitor to Olympic and Aegean, "may not continue to act as a viable competitive force on the Greek 
domestic market in the future".
Earlier this year Mr Almunia blocked Ryanair's third attempt to take over Aer Lingus, the Irish flag-carrier. It 
represented the first time the Commission has blocked the same proposed merger twice.

After years of losses at US airlines caused by cut-throat competition in what was a fragmented market, the industry 
hopes it is entering a new era of long-term profitability.
Over the past decade, consolidation has reduced the number of large carriers from eight to five, and with the 
merger proposed in February between American Airlines and US Airways, the market is set to reduce to four. Most 
of these carriers reported higher profits last year and some - such as Delta Air Lines - are planning to resume 
returning cash to shareholders via dividends or share buybacks.
But why is this trend struggling to take hold in Europe? Like the US, the EU market has been consolidating - 
through mergers such as that between Air France and KLM, and British Airways and Iberia - but there are still far 
too many flag carriers, and profitable budget airlines led by Ryanair and easyJet are providing fierce competition on 
short-haul routes.
Even EU flag carriers that are profitable are reporting falling underlying earnings amid the eurozone recession. 
Lufthansa, Europe's largest carrier by revenue and one of the few to pay a dividend, cancelled its 2012 payout.
Rigas Doganis, visiting professor at Cranfield University and a non-executive director at easyJet, says some of 
Europe's small and medium-sized flag carriers could be doomed unless they can find protection inside a larger 
group.
"They are too small to compete effectively in the long-haul markets against the big players, and too high cost to 
compete effectively in the short-haul markets against the low-cost carriers," he adds.
EU airline consolidation slow to take off
His statement highlights how Europe is likely to experience some high-profile airline failures as well as mergers, 
because consolidation of the EU aviation market has not delivered the level of market concentration found in the 
US.
The wave of US mergers resulted in the top five carriers - United, Delta, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and 
US Airways - holding 82 per cent of domestic seating capacity last year, compared to 68 per cent in 2008, 
according to estimates by Deutsche Bank analysts and Diio Mi.
These carriers' increasing dominance is providing them with the opportunity to end the irrational practices of the 
past, when airlines would try to usurp each other by ramping capacity and slashing fares.
The remaining big carriers in the US are wielding much greater market power - giving them the opportunity to cut 
capacity and raise ticket prices. This may be bad news for passengers, but investors are hoping US airlines are 
now an attractive proposition.
Contrast this situation with Europe, where the top five carriers - Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, International Airlines 
Group, Ryanair and easyJet - held only 52 per cent of capacity on flights within the EU last year.
The top five European carriers held 41 per cent of capacity in 2008, so market concentration has increased, but it is 
far behind the levels in the US. Profitability is also lower - European airlines had a combined net margin of 0.3 per 
cent in 2012, compared to 2.3 per cent at North American carriers, according to Iata, the industry's global trade 
body.
One important driver of consolidation in the US aviation market has been the country's bankruptcy regime. US 
carriers have used the Chapter 11 procedure to cut their high operating costs.
Brian Havel, director of the International Aviation Law Institute, says: "By using Chapter 11 to reject leases and 
renegotiate labour contracts, struggling airlines become more attractive targets for takeover."
This assertion is borne out by how US Airways pursued a merger with AMR, American Airlines' parent, after it filed 
for bankruptcy protection in 2011.
The EU does not have an equivalent to Chapter 11, and the airline mergers that have occurred - led by the 2004 
combination between Air France and KLM - are notable for how they subsequently failed to secure significant cost 
savings through rationalisation.
The three big flag carrier groups - Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG - are now belatedly engaged in thorough 
restructurings, and therefore are unlikely to do large acquisitions soon.
But the biggest factor explaining why US airlines have consolidated far more than EU carriers is the simple truth 
that it is much easier to do mergers in a single country.
Cross-border airline mergers are difficult in the EU, not least because many governments prize having an 
independent flag carrier.
Mergers are also complicated because the industry is surrounded by antiquated ownership rules. Since the 1940s, 
carriers' rights to fly into other countries' airports are usually based on bilateral agreements between governments 
that require airlines to be "substantially owned and effectively controlled" by nationals of their own state.
Last week, Siim Kallas, European transport commissioner, used a speech in Washington to make a fresh push for 
consolidation between European and American carriers, so they can compete more effectively against fast-growing 
Gulf and Asian airlines.
He called for lawmakers to relax rules that prevent foreign companies owning more than 25 per cent of US airlines, 
but Ed Bastian, Delta's president, says such reform is unlikely, because workers fear mergers with EU carriers 
would mean job losses.
EU airline consolidation slow to take off
"I think the employees of the airlines are concerned about jobs in the weak economic setting, and I believe their 
voice will be - and is - heard loud and strong in Washington," he adds.

Like post-election Italy, Alitalia is leaderless, short on cash and confused about its future. The sorry resemblance 
between nation and national airline is not coincidental. Alitalia's desperate condition arises from the same politically 
driven industrial decisions and misused public money that for decades have hobbled Italian economic performance.
At Alitalia these failings culminated in a rescue plan hatched five years ago by a cabal of Italian political, 
bureaucratic, banking and industrial interests. None of them knew much about the airline industry, but the 
ringleaders were hell-bent on preventing a foreign takeover of the stony broke flag-carrier. Their plan, codenamed 
"Project Phoenix", put Alitalia on a trajectory that increasingly looks like a boomerang to bankruptcy.
According to industry specialists at the Sydney-based Capa Centre for Aviation, Alitalia has made a cumulative net 
loss since its relaunch in 2009 of EUR843m. Other than low-cost carriers such as EasyJet and Ryanair, few 
European airlines are these days in comfortable financial health. But the malaise of Alitalia stands out. Its cash 
reserves were so depleted two months ago that it required a EUR150m loan from its shareholders to stay in the air.
Now it is difficult to see where salvation will come from. If salvation means inspired leadership, then it will not come 
from Andrea Ragnetti, the hapless chief executive who resigned in February after a mere 12 months in office, 
pausing only to announce that Alitalia had made a EUR280m net loss in 2012. If salvation means a fresh injection 
of long-term capital, then it will not come from Air France-KLM, which bought a 25 per cent stake in Alitalia in 2009. 
The French-Dutch airline group is itself too financially squeezed to risk a second bet on one of Italy's most 
notoriously lossmaking companies.
As for the Italian investors who joined the 2008 rescue consortium organised by Silvio Berlusconi, the former 
premier, some are said to be losing patience with Alitalia's seemingly incurable addiction to other people's cash. A 
Phoenix sends Alitalia towards bankruptcy
binding agreement to stay part of the consortium expired in January. Now investors such as Atlantia, a motorway 
operator, and Immsi, an industrial investment company, are free to sell their stakes.
An attempt at salvation may, of course, come from Italian politicians and state administrators of similar 
temperament to those who poured several billion euros into Alitalia between 1998 and 2008 in the name of 
maintaining the airline's Italian identity. The state still owns almost half of Alitalia, so the temptation to patch things 
up one more time, if only temporarily, will be strong.
Particularly in northern Italy, the nation's financial and industrial heartland, there are political forces that view the 
preservation of an airline with a strong Milan presence as essential to their influence.
But once Italy emerges from political paralysis and forms a stable government - a prospect still some months away - 
the reality will sink in that the nation is trapped in economic stagnation, ever at risk in the eurozone debt crisis and 
unable to throw money at dysfunctional public sector companies as liberally as it used to. It is also open to doubt 
that Europe's competition regulators would let Alitalia get away with yet another dollop of state aid.
In this context it is good that Italy's antitrust regulators have opened the all-important route between Rome 
Fiumicino and Milan Linate airports to more competition. It says everything about Alitalia and its monopolistic 
mindset that the airline's lawyers tried to block the regulators' order last October to hand over seven slots at Linate 
to easyJet.
Before 2008 Alitalia enjoyed such control of this lucrative route that the airline allocated a number of seats every 
day to its own staff, who merrily shuttled at no cost to themselves between Milan and Rome. No wonder that the 
losses piled up at Alitalia. No wonder that ruthlessly cost-conscious discount airlines have made such inroads into 
the Italian market.
In fairness to Alitalia's staff, some improvements have taken place over the past four years. The airline no longer 
has the reputation of being Europe's worst for taking off and landing on time. Its aircraft are more modern, and so is 
the attitude of its employees towards customers. In December Alitalia won a "best airline cuisine" award from 
Global Traveler, a US magazine, for the third successive year.
But delicious food and service with a smile will not be enough to keep Alitalia competitive. How Italy's politicians 
and business people settle the airline's future will be the measure of how serious they are about reforming the 
Italian economy.

Iberia is planning deeper wage cuts for employees after failing to reach agreement with trade unions on productivity 
improvements at the lossmaking Spanish airline.
Iberia, part of International Airlines Group, said pilots and cabin crew would face wage cuts of 18 per cent, rather 
than a 14 per cent reduction. Ground staff face cuts of 11 per cent rather than 7 per cent. These deeper cuts are 
consistent with recommendations by a government-appointed mediator asked to bring an end to strikes at the 
Spanish airline.
Iberia last November proposed cutting 4,500 jobs at Iberia - 22 per cent of the workforce - but last month it 
accepted the mediator's proposal that the figure should be reduced to 3,141.
Unions representing ground staff and cabin crew have accepted the mediator's recommendations.
Sepla, the pilots' union, has not accepted the recommendations, but Iberia said the proposed 18 per cent cut in 
wages would apply to this group of employees. Sepla could not be reached for comment.
The deeper wage cuts should provide Iberia with a quicker route to cost savings than productivity improvements, 
although changes to working practices are still likely to be needed if Iberia is to compete better against budget 
airlines led by Ryanair and long-haul carriers such as Latam Airline Group.
The losses at Iberia pushed IAG to a pre-tax loss of EUR997m last year. British Airways, IAG's UK subsidiary, 
recorded a EUR295m operating profit in 2012, while Iberia reported an EUR896m loss, partly because of a large 
impairment charge.

Turkish Airlines has followed its March order for 82 Airbus jets with a deal to buy 70 single-aisle aircraft from 
Boeing, the bulk of which will be the US manufacturer's new, more fuel-efficient Max model.
The order, which has yet to be finalised, is worth $6.9bn at list prices, and includes options for a further 25 Boeing 
737 Max 8s.
The fast-growing airline, which flies to more countries than any rival - 219 cities in 98 countries - expects passenger 
numbers to grow nearly 20 per cent in 2013 to 46m, and to hit 90m by the end of the decade.
Turkish Airlines, which is half-owned by the government, has committed to buy 50 737 Max jets and 20 current-
generation aircraft over the next eight years.
It plans to leverage Istanbul's proximity to European destinations, as well as the Middle East, Africa and Asia, three 
regions where aviation growth is expected to outpace that in developed economies.
Boeing and Airbus have racked up a series of recent orders, including from IAG - the parent of British Airways and 
Iberia - and Indonesia's Lion Air. Low-cost carrier Ryanair last month took advantage of Boeing's need to find 
buyers for its non-Max aircraft by agreeing to purchase 175 current-generation jets with a book value of $16bn.
Investors in easyJet are also awaiting the outcome of the low-cost carrier's deliberations over placing a large order - 
most likely with Airbus, which currently supplies the whole of its fleet.

One of the recurring themes of this column has been how the internet can vastly improve the quality of your 
research process, notably by making once expensive institutional-focused research tools available at low cost to 
investors.
The internet is also helping to chip away at the cost of investing, with online stockbrokers and fund platforms using 
the web to push dealing costs down. The new Club Finance share-dealing platform Frequent Trader pushes 
individual dealing ticket prices down to 50p a trade (although you'll still pay an admin fee: £25 per quarter plus 
VAT).
But important as costs may be, they aren't everything. To understand this point, consider the travel industry, where 
"disintermediation" has had a huge impact. Headline costs have tumbled but charges have appeared elsewhere - 
credit card fees, baggage charges and seat reservations. Consumers now understand that they have a choice: 
book it yourself, travel light, do without food and pay less; or pay more, have a travel agent sort it out and get the 
full air travel experience. That means Ryanair and easyJet exist alongside Swiss and Virgin Atlantic.
Consumers are helped through the travel maze by a burgeoning "reviews" industry. TripAdvisor in particular has 
become so ubiquitous that its reviews are often integrated into hotel or airline websites. Like many readers, I rarely 
travel anywhere without first checking the range of comments about my destination first.
Why hasn't this crowd-sourced wisdom spread to the world of investing, where the sums of money at stake are 
rather more material? There are some excellent parts of the MoneySavingExpert website, but if I want to compare, 
say, Barclays with TD, it's hard to find a site that allows me to browse users' views or share investment ideas.
Welcome to TripAdvisor for Sipps
The good news is that some players are making bold new moves on this front. Social investing is emerging fast via 
platforms such as Vidivici, which draws on the wisdom of the crowd to research an investment opportunity. 
VouchedFor allows users to rate independent financial advisers.
IFA online platform Investment Sense has just launched its first stab at this form of investment advice via its Sipp 
Chat offering - available at www.investmentsense.co.uk/sipp-chat/ from the beginning of April. In simple terms this 
is TripAdvisor for Sipps, allowing users to submit reviews, rate their provider in a variety of categories and then 
leave comments. Potential Sipp investors can then use the information to help build up a picture of potential 
providers based on actual user experiences. This is important when you think that a pension plan can be a multi-
decade commitment and the costs of switching providers can be quite high.
The idea is that investors will use the internet not just to pick the cheapest product but the "best product at the best 
price". Again, this is important in the Sipp arena because the limitations of no-frills Sipps are becoming very 
apparent. I'm a case in point - I have a bog-standard wrapper with a major provider, which does just fine as an 
online share-dealing account. But I'd like to diversify my holdings and include less traditional investments such as 
commercial property or private company shares. Will my provider have a product (at the right charge) that will grow 
as my portfolio becomes more diversified? And when I retire, will I be forced down the annuity route, or can I opt for 
some form of drawdown?
Financial and regulatory stability is also increasingly important. "Following the publication of the FSA's consultation 
paper CP 12/33, it's clear that the capital adequacy requirements for almost all Sipp providers will rise considerably 
in the future," says Philip Bray, marketing manager of Investment Sense. Consolidation is highly likely. Could your 
provider be a sitting duck for a bigger group - and what would happen if it were taken over?
Hopefully, as Sipp Chat grows, there'll be a body of commentary that might help Sipp investors make better 
decisions. In the meantime it's worth noting that the top five providers currently are all smaller, more bespoke 
players, offering products that cost a great deal more than the likes of Hargreaves or Sippdeal. They are: Xafinity, 
InvestAcc Pension Administration, Dentons, Barnett Waddingham, and Liberty.

EasyJet has narrowed its range of forecast losses for the first half of its financial year - the typically quiet late 
autumn and winter months - to between £60m and £65m.
The low-cost carrier, which previously forecast a £50m-£75m pre-tax loss, said revenues per seat rose at a slightly 
higher rate than expected in the six months to March 31, thanks in part to last-minute bookings ahead of Easter and 
its earlier timing compared with last year.
The 8.5 per cent growth in unit revenues was partly offset by a 3.5 per cent rise in costs per seat - though this was 
at the lower end of the company's expectations in January. Capacity growth was also held in check by poor weather 
that led to flight cancellations.
Carolyn McCall, chief executive, attributed the company's halving of pre-tax losses from 2011-12 figures to industry-
wide capacity constraints, as well as the cold March weather across northern Europe, "which stimulated strong 
bookings in the last few weeks of the first half of the financial year".
Analysts were encouraged by the strong numbers, although Donal O'Neill at Goodbody in Dublin said: "I wouldn't 
extrapolate too much of that into the second half," pointing out the lift to bookings was helped by the cold weather.
The weak pound has hurt the company's performance, reducing income by an expected £30m-£35m, the company 
said.
Ms McCall also said easyJet, which is considering a big aircraft order, had decided to exercise options on three 
Airbus A320 jets while it continued its deliberations.
EasyJet boosted by last-minute bookings
An order would follow deals by rival Ryanair for Boeing current-generation aircraft - as opposed to the newer, more 
fuel-efficient models easyJet is after - and by Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa and Lion Air for A320 neos, the 
manufacturer's greener model, expected to enter service in two-years' time.
Any significant order is likely to meet opposition from Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, easyJet's founder and still its biggest 
shareholder, who is concerned new aircraft will undermine the company's strong financial performance of recent 
years.
But analysts warned that easyJet might need to act quickly if it wanted at least some of the new aircraft within the 
next four or five years.
Shares in the carrier fell 6.38 per cent by close of trading London trading to £10.27, partially offsetting a 5 per cent 
rise over the past two weeks in the run-up to Friday's trading statement.

The weak pound has hurt the company's performance, reducing income by an expected £30m-£35m, the company 
said.
Ms McCall also said easyJet, which is considering a big aircraft order, had decided to exercise options on three 
Airbus A320 jets while it continued its deliberations.
EasyJet boosted by last-minute bookings
An order would follow deals by rival Ryanair for Boeing current-generation aircraft - as opposed to the newer, more 
fuel-efficient models easyJet is after - and by Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa and Lion Air for A320 neos, the 
manufacturer's greener model, expected to enter service in two-years' time.
Any significant order is likely to meet opposition from Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, easyJet's founder and still its biggest 
shareholder, who is concerned new aircraft will undermine the company's strong financial performance of recent 
years.
But analysts warned that easyJet might need to act quickly if it wanted at least some of the new aircraft within the 
next four or five years.
Shares in the carrier fell 3.4 per cent in early London trading to £10.50, partially offsetting a 5 per cent rise over the 
past two weeks in the run-up to Friday's trading statement.

Norwegian airline counts on Asian tourists

Norwegian Air Shuttle, Europe's third-biggest budget airline by revenues, is counting on growing numbers of Asian 
tourists to fill its seats as its fleet nearly triples to between 150 and 200 aircraft over the next seven years.
Bjørn Kjos, chief executive, said last month that strong growth in the Asian-originating leisure market meant he had 
little concern about overcapacity even as he and rivals put in big orders for new aircraft.
"Our biggest problem today is actually lack of production," said the former fighter pilot. "We could put many more 
aircraft into use than we have."
He was speaking soon after Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, made a deal to buy 175 narrow body 
Boeing jets, followed by significant orders from Turkish Airlines, Lion Air and Lufthansa.
Norwegian itself ordered 222 Boeing and Airbus aircraft 15 months ago in what many saw as a gamble that SAS, 
the Scandinavian legacy carrier, would collapse. Instead, late last year the full-service airline avoided bankruptcy by 
negotiating a deal with unions that significantly reduced its cost base.
Mr Kjos argues his company was prepared for that outcome: "We said, even if SAS goes belly-up, there will always 
be another airline in the market and competitors will come in."
As it is, competitors are coming despite SAS's survival: easyJet last month launched its first route into Norway, with 
daily flights connecting London Gatwick and Bergen.
Norwegian airline counts on Asian tourists
But part of Mr Kjos's confidence derives from his customer base being wider than that of Ryanair or easyJet, thanks 
to its long-haul services into the US and Asia. The latter is, in his view, the more important market, and it is tourists 
his team are after.
"I think in the future the big rise will be in the leisure market. Eighty-five per cent of the market is leisure. In 15 or 20 
years, that will be 95 per cent."
Norwegian's competitive cost base will allow it to win greater portions of those travellers than global rivals, Mr Kjos 
said - and last year's aircraft order was key to maintaining that advantage since new, more fuel-efficient aircraft help 
deliver low operating costs.
Indeed, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner was due to save Norwegian EUR6m per year per aircraft compared with the next-
best option. But that plan has been scuppered in the short term by the Dreamliner's battery problems.
The airline is in talks with Boeing over compensation for delivery delays, which have caused it to turn to the Airbus 
A340 instead - a gas-guzzler in comparison. Norwegian has eight 787s on order and may buy more despite the 
battery fires, Mr Kjos told Bloomberg last month.

Using the Charlie Brown rating system, which European shares were the heroes during the first quarter and which 
were the goats? It was certainly a tricky time to pick stocks. The Euro Stoxx index was up only 2 per cent and its 
laboured progress mirrored the zigzag across Charlie Brown's shirt. Sentiment, too, was all over the place, starting 
the year fairly buoyant, then suddenly being walloped by Cyprus at the end of the quarter.
Nor did the sectors that finished as heroes appear to share much in common. Healthcare (defensive) names rose 
alongside financial services (cyclical), as did consumer products (defensive) and media (defensive). Sure, there 
were the classic rebound stocks that had suffered previously such as 3i, Bank of Ireland, Telefónica and Repsol. 
But investors would be forgiven for asking why many of the other names topped the rankings. EADS, for example, 
up 30 per cent, has been shooting the lights out ever since its "transformational" deal with BAE crashed and burnt. 
And who would have thought that housebuilders in the UK would have been given such a gift from the 
government's 2013 Budget? Retailers such as Carrefour, up 13 per cent, also did pretty well, although conditions 
remain tough. Investors obviously found the French retailer's recent turnround efforts to be encouraging. Most 
surprisingly of all, three airlines, IAG, easyJet and Ryanair make the top 20 best performers despite being, well, 
airline stocks. Warren Buffett eat your heart out.
And what about the goats? Mining names such as Rio Tinto had a nightmare as investors worried about the outlook 
for commodity prices and China. Few will be feeling sorry for the likes of London-listed miner Kazakhmys, down 
almost 50 per cent, or the National Bank of Greece. Still, TNT Express probably feels a tad hard done by after the 
European Commission blocked its acquisition by UPS. ArcelorMittal shares, meanwhile, cannot seem to stop 
falling. And if investors thought Volkswagen shares looked cheap at the start of the year on 6.3 times forward 
earnings, they are now in the unfortunate position of holding a stock worth another 10 per cent less while at the 
same time being slightly more expensive.
Shares: Heroes ride, goats walk
The lesson for investors from all of this is the same as it ever was. Pick and hold individual stocks on their merits 
relative to valuation. Or buy an index fund.

The aviation industry strongly criticised George Osborne after the chancellor once again rejected its call for the 
abolition of air passenger duty.
The Budget confirmed the duty would increase in line with the retail prices index measure of inflation next month, 
but also disclosed it would do so again in April 2014.
It means that from next month the duty could add £94 to the price of a long-haul economy flight of more than 6,000 
miles and £188 to business and first class tickets.
But the duty on short-haul flights of less than 2,000 miles should not increase for economy, business or first class 
passengers.
EasyJet, International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic said in a joint statement 
that they were "very disappointed" at the planned increases in the duty affecting medium and long-haul flights.
"These rises in air passenger duty show the emptiness of rhetoric on boosting exports to emerging economies and 
building the most competitive tax system in the world," said the airlines.
The four carriers published a report in February by PwC, the consultants, that found UK air passenger duty to be 
the highest tax of its type in the world.
The report concluded that abolishing the duty would boost gross domestic product by 0.45 per cent in its first year 
by expanding investment and exports, including earnings from foreign tourism.
Budget 2013: Airlines attack air passenger duty rise
But the Treasury disputed the analysis and the Budget red book confirmed that air passenger duty was expected to 
raise £2.9bn in revenue in 2013-14 and £3bn in 2014-15.
The Budget also confirmed the extension of the duty to business jets from next month, raising £5m each year from 
2013-14.
Operators of these jets will from next month pay £52 for each business executive if their aircraft weigh more than 20 
tonnes and are on short-haul flights of less than 2,000 miles.
But the duty will rise to £376 for each executive on long-haul flights of more than 6,000 miles.
Patrick Margetson-Rushmore, chief executive of London Executive Aviation, a business jet charter operator, said 
the extension of the duty to business jets might be seen as a "fat cat's tax", but added that people flying on these 
aircraft were creating business and employment.

Shares in Iliad, the French telecoms operator owned by billionaire Xavier Niel, rallied even as it reported net income 
fell more than a quarter in 2012.
The low-cost telecoms group on Tuesday said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 10.6 
per cent to EUR921.4m, beating consensus expectations for EUR827.77m.
Yet there was a 26 per cent fall in net income from the previous year, as the company put nearly a third of its 
revenues towards increasing its network coverage and expanding its market share. The shares gained 5.2 per cent 
to EUR157.50.
Ryanair signalled to the market that it was preparing to increase its capital expenditure with plans to buy 175 jets 
from Boeing in a $16bn deal.
The low-cost carrier also said it would not issue any special dividends but would begin a share buyback programme 
again in 2015.
Investors weighed in with a show of confidence, sending the shares climbing 4.3 per cent to EUR6.05.
More widely, European markets continued to be in risk-off mode for a second session as uncertainty over a bailout 
for Cyprus continued to loom.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.4 per cent to 1,194.91. Banking stocks endured a second day of heavy selling with 
the banking sub-index sliding 2 per cent.

Spanish and French lenders were among the worst performing stocks.
Caixabank slid 5.9 per cent to EUR2.66, while Banco Sabadell lost 5.2 per cent to EUR1.55. BBVA, Spain's 
second-largest bank by assets, lost 4.8 per cent to EUR7.23.
Renta Corporacion, the Spanish property group, said it planned to file for insolvency. It has EUR162m in loans 
outstanding from lenders including Caixabank, Deutsche Bank, and Banco Popular.
Madrid's benchmark Ibex 35 index slumped 2.2 per cent to 8,321.
In Paris, Crédit Agricole fell 5.7 per cent to EUR6.56, while BNP Paribas lost 4.2 per cent to EUR40.96. The 
benchmark CAC 40 closed down 1.3 per cent to 3,775.75.
Germany's Deutsche Bank also lost ground, sliding 4.4 per cent to EUR32.01.

Ryanair signalled a new phase of growth on Tuesday by unveiling plans to buy 175 narrow-body passenger jets 
from Boeing in a deal worth $15.6bn.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue has made a commitment to purchase 175 of Boeing's current 
generation 737-800s.
Ryanair already has 305 of these aircraft in its all-Boeing fleet, and carried almost 76m passengers in the year to 
March 2012.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, told the Financial Times in 2011 that he was mulling fleet expansion 
that could enable the airline to carry up to 130m passengers each year by the end of this decade.
Ryanair, like its rival easyJet, has been taking market share on short-haul routes from European flag carriers led by 
Lufthansa, Air-France KLM and International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways and Iberia.
Ray Conner, head of Boeing's commercial aircraft division, said of the company's latest deal with Ryanair: "We are 
pleased that the . . . 737, as the most efficient, most reliable single-aisle aeroplane flying today, has been and will 
continue to be the cornerstone of the Ryanair fleet.
"Our partnership with this great European low-cost carrier is of the utmost importance to everyone at the Boeing 
company."
Ryanair has yet to turn its commitment to buy the 175 narrow-body aircraft into a firm order with Boeing.

These aircraft are worth $15.6bn at list prices, but Ryanair, like other airlines purchasing many jets, is expected to 
secure a significant discount.

Ryanair signalled a new phase of growth on Tuesday by unveiling plans to buy 175 narrow-body passenger jets 
from Boeing in a $16bn deal.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, told the Financial Times that Europe's largest low-cost carrier by 
revenue would consider purchasing at least a further 125 Boeing aircraft.
He also said Ryanair would not issue any special dividends or embark on share buybacks this year or next because 
of its proposed fleet expansion.
Ryanair announced a commitment on Tuesday to buy 175 of Boeing's current generation 737-800 narrow-body 
aircraft.
But it will consider the case for also purchasing at least 125 of Boeing's planned next generation 737 Max aircraft 
which will have more fuel-efficient engines.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair could continue to increase its market share at the expense of flag carriers and other 
airlines on European short-haul routes.
He cited growth opportunities created by capacity cuts or restructurings at Air Berlin, International Airlines Group's 
Iberia, Alitalia, SAS, LOT Polish Airlines and Lufthansa.
"We want to position ourselves with these new aircraft to take up these opportunities," said Mr O'Leary. Shares in 
Ryanair were up almost 3.5 per cent at EUR6 in afternoon trading.
Ryanair orders 175 Boeing jets
Ryanair has a fleet of 305 aircraft, comprised entirely of Boeing 737-800s, and it carried almost 76m passengers in 
the year to March 2012.
With the additional 175 aircraft, Ryanair expects to increase its fleet to 400 - because some new jets will replace 
older ones - and carry 100m passengers in the year to March 2019.
But Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had a team evaluating the case for buying Boeing's planned 737 Max, and that - taken 
together with the 175 737-800s - the airline could end up buying more than 300 narrow-body aircraft from the US 
manufacturer.
That meant that Ryanair could increase its fleet to 500, and carry 120m passengers each year by the early 2020s.
Ray Conner, head of Boeing's commercial aircraft division, said of the company's latest deal with Ryanair: "We are 
pleased that the . . . 737 . . . has been and will continue to be the cornerstone of the Ryanair fleet."
The 175 737-800s that Ryanair is proposing to buy are worth $15.6bn at list prices, but Mr O'Leary said he had 
secured a "reasonable discount" with Boeing.
Ryanair paid a second special dividend last year worth EUR492m, but Mr O'Leary said he did not expect further 
payouts, or share buybacks, until 2015 or 2016, given the airline's increased capital expenditure on new aircraft.
He also insisted Ryanair had not given up on its efforts to take over Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, in spite of the 
European Commission's prohibition of the deal last month. Ryanair is appealing against the decision.

Has life just got a whole lot tougher for airlines operating in Europe? It is certainly arguable that Ryanair's purchase 
of 175 new 737 Boeing aircraft, to be delivered between 2014 and 2018, paves the way for a more disruptive 
market in the coming years. In spite of widespread recession and high fuel prices, the airline business has actually 
been quite disciplined over the past 18 months. Flag carriers have been restructuring and weaker airlines, from 
Spanair to Malev, have grounded fleets. With capacity under control, some carriers - including Ryanair - have been 
able to push up yields. Overall, according to Iata, the region probably broke even last year.
Ryanair's new planes, though, will increase its fleet from 300 to 400 aircraft over the delivery period. (About 75 are 
replacement aircraft). That, the aggressive low-cost carrier says, will facilitate annual growth of about 5 per cent per 
annum and allow it to push its EU market share from 15 to 20 per cent. Investors who may have worried that the 
company was turning into a well-run, ex-growth cash-generation machine, should have their doubts dispelled. 
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary also sees less fleet seasonality: oil price moves permitting, the airline will park fewer 
aircraft in the winter months, upping the pressure on competitors.
The growth forecasts are not outlandish and the planned progress looks reasonably measured. Even so, the Boeing 
deal still gave Ryanair shares, trading on a 14 times 2013/14 earnings multiple, a four per cent bounce on Tuesday. 
Ryanair's gain, meanwhile, was matched by losses elsewhere: IAG, Air France and Lufthansa were all down.

Thinking of buying shares in the Esure public offer? There's no shortage of brokers offering you the chance - 17 
have signed up to flog the shares to retail investors. But before you fill in the application form, consider the 
cautionary tale of a broken gnome.
The garden adornment in question was taken from a neighbour's property on Hallow'een a few years ago, no doubt 
as part of a drunken prank. Once the pilferer grew tired of carrying it, he hurled it across the road, whereupon it 
bounced off my car bonnet and came to rest on the pavement - minus its head, which I found by my front bumper, 
gazing forlornly at the sky.
What has this to do with insurance? Well, I took my car to a local bodyshop to get an estimate for fixing the 
substantial dent that the gnome's headbutt had left in the bonnet. The first question I was asked was: "Is the 
insurance paying, or are you?"
What difference would it make, I asked. "Well if you're paying, we'll beat it out and respray it. If the insurance is 
paying, we'll just get a new bonnet." The difference in monetary terms was material and, as it turned out, 
uneconomic for an 11-year-old motor.
Does the industry know that it's been taken for a ride in this way; that there are two prices for every job? Of course.
It knows, too, that the rates it is charged for providing hire cars to not-at-fault accident victims are inflated and that 
many of the "whiplash" injury claims pursued by ambulance-chasing lawyers are entirely spurious.
Calm down, dear - it's only an insurer
You might object that I'm being too cynical by half. But take a look at what the Office of Fair Trading said about the 
industry when it launched a probe last year:
"The insurers of at-fault drivers appear to have little control over the bills they must pay, and this may be leading to 
higher costs for them and ultimately higher premiums for motorists," said chief executive Clive Maxwell at the time. 
The OFT said the average repair bill was inflated by £155 and the average car hire bill by more than £500.
&lt;
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
&gt;I suspect the industry is unperturbed by this for two reasons. One is that such high costs deter potential new 
entrants to a crowded market. But, mostly, it's because insurers receive a cut on every referral, a few quid extra for 
every bit of "motor legal protection" added to a policy. Such "ancillary revenues" are the insurance industry's 
equivalent of Ryanair's excess baggage charges. It needs them because the basic business of underwriting motor 
insurance - like running an airline - is highly competitive and barely profitable.
True, Esure is better than most in this respect. The key profitability metric in insurance is the "combined ratio" of 
claims to premiums, where lower is better. At group level, Esure's is lower than its quoted rivals (see table). Its 
dividend policy - it pledges to pay out half of post-tax reported profit to shareholders, with more as special dividends 
- looks good too.
But not as good as its timing. The insurer is coming to market just as the FTSE 250 - of which it would most likely 
become a constituent - has smashed through new highs, and low rates of return elsewhere have reinvigorated retail 
investors' interest in the stock market. Motor premiums may also be close to a cyclical peak, while the introduction 
of gender-neutral pricing has generated a one-off boost for its Sheilas' Wheels brand, which caters for women 
drivers.
Direct Line, another general insurer with a big motor book, came to market last autumn and its shares have risen 
about 10 per cent since.
As with most recent flotations, it pays to look at who is selling and why. Esure was founded by Peter Wood and he 
led a management buyout of it a few years ago, along with Tosca Penta, a private equity firm. They're now selling 
parts of their stakes for over £400m, and the £50m of new money being raised will be used to refinance debt. In 
other words, you the investor are a mere ballbearing in a piece of financial engineering, providing a capital gain 
rather than capital.
Esure will probably be a reasonable dividend stock. But it's unlikely to be exciting, and there are risks: regulatory 
action might trim those ancillary revenues, premium rates may decline, and dividends may not be bombproof, as 
RSA, a general insurer, has recently demonstrated. So, if you elect to buy the shares, don't be like my neighbour's 
gnome. Don't lose your head.

Boeing investors are not narrow-minded, even if the aircraft manufacturer (mostly) is. Shareholders have shrugged 
off the much-publicised battery troubles of the widebodied Dreamliner and enjoyed the ride as Boeing's shares 
have risen 12 per cent this year.
There are 50 Boeing 787 Dreamliners in operation. Another 750 Dreamliners will be delivered in the next several 
years, but only 200 in the next two, according to Credit Suisse. By contrast, of the 1,400 aircraft Boeing is set to 
deliver in the next two years, 900 will be the narrow-bodied 737's, which seat fewer than 150 passengers, to the 
Dreamliner's 300, (and cost about half as much). The rumoured $18bn deal this week with Ryanair is for 200 of 
these narrow planes. Boeing's image is dominated by the Dreamliner; its business is dominated, for now, by the 
737.
There are, however, rumblings of increased competition in the market for smaller jets, which Boeing and Airbus 
currently split 50/50. In the next two years Bombardier begins delivering its narrow-bodied CSeries. And there will 
be Chinese and Russian entrants as well. Airbus and Boeing, meanwhile, have their next generation versions 
coming on stream in the next five years.
For now, though, Boeing is well-positioned. Its backlog exceeds six years and from 2011 to 2014 shipments are 
expected to grow on average 15 per cent annually. Airlines have embraced efficient new models in an era of higher 
jet fuel costs and growing global demand.
Boeing's share price ascent in 2013 follows a bump of only 3 per cent in 2012. It trades at 16 times forward 
earnings, the same as early 2012 so earnings growth has powered the higher share price. With news that the US 
aviation regulator has approved Boeing's plan to resolve the Dreamliner battery issue, there could be room for 
multiple expansion too.

Airlines will be required to provide board and lodging for just three days to passengers whose flights are delayed or 
cancelled because of severe weather or worker strikes, under new EU rules.
Carriers had been lobbying for passenger-rights legislation that would remove a duty of care requirement 
introduced by the European Court of Justice four years ago. Instead, the rules would make it law, though they limit 
the time period to three days, representing something of a victory for the airline industry.
Ryanair recently lost a case in the European courts over whether it owed one Irish customer a week's worth of hotel 
bills after she was stranded in Faro, Portugal following the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, which 
caused a cloud of ash and led to the closure of much of northern Europe's airspace.
The new rules also deny the right to compensation of up to EUR600 to passengers delayed or stranded by 
circumstances beyond an airline's control, and raise from three hours to five the minimum delay before which 
customers would receive compensation under other circumstances.
Consumer groups said they were pleased that at least some room and board would now be written into law, but hit 
out at the three-day cap and the longer allowance for delays without compensation.
The rules extend passengers' rights in other key areas, including eliminating penalties for wrongly spelt names on 
tickets, giving new rights to passengers stranded on the tarmac, and providing a timeframe by which airlines need 
to respond to complaints and compensation requests.
Payment for some air delays cut
"While passengers have very strong passenger rights defined under EU law, they can have difficulty claiming 
them," the European Commission said on Wednesday.
Chris Bryant, a senior associate at the law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner, said: "It's pretty much 'win some, lose 
some' for both sides."
Iata, the airline industry association, criticised the new provisions, particularly a requirement that airlines give 
passengers on cancelled flights seats with rival carriers if they themselves cannot get them to their destinations 
within 12 hours of the original arrival time - even if that means flying them in rivals' first-class cabins. "If your Bic pen 
doesn't work, you don't expect to get a Mont Blanc as compensation," said Tony Tyler, Iata's chief executive.
He also raised concerns over new provisions for passengers who miss connecting flights due to late-arriving aircraft 
on the first leg of a journey.
The hope in Brussels is that the changes will reduce cancelled flights, speed the resolution of compensation claims 
and provide clarity to the law. Mr Bryant said that disputes over the current measures - introduced in 2005 - "went to 
the courts loads".
He added: "What they're proposing has a decent chance of going through [the Parliament and being passed by EU 
member states] relatively close to its current form."

US stocks retreated from multiyear highs on Tuesday with the leading US benchmark set to snap a seven-day 
winning streak as investors looked to take profits.
The S&P 500, which had been approaching all-time record levels during its multi-day run, fell 0.3 per cent to 
1,552.26 by 1pm in New York.
Defensive sectors, led by telecoms and healthcare, were among the few rising industry groups on the benchmark, 
while those more closely tied to the global economy cooled.
"We've been up so many days in a row that we were due for some profit-taking," said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives 
strategist at TD Ameritrade. Meanwhile, the CBOE Vix index, a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500 and a 
gauge for investor nerves, rose 8 per cent to 12 after touching a six-year low a day earlier.
"On a normal day, a jump in the Vix like this would definitely catch your attention, but considering where we are 
coming from it should be expected," Mr Kinahan added.
Shares in Yum! Brands were among the best performing stocks on the benchmark to start the day after the fast-
food chain operator said its business in China picked up in February.
The company, which operates fast-food restaurants such as KFC and Taco Bell, gained as much as 5.4 per cent in 
early morning trading. But by 1pm, shares were 1.4 per cent higher to $68.71.
US equities step back from all-time highs
Jefferies' analyst Andy Barish said the stock, which trades at a multiple of 23 times its forward earnings forecast for 
2013, was fairly valued despite the better-than-expected sales results.
Meanwhile, Costco rose 2.4 per cent to $104.94 as the wholesale retailer said higher membership fees helped it 
beat analysts' forecasts for its latest quarterly profits. The company also reported a pick-up in market share against 
its competitors, including Walmart. Shares in Walmart were 1.1 per cent higher at $73.79.
JC Penney, a US department store chain, climbed 4.9 per cent to $15.79 as it moved to deny market rumours that 
its chief executive was planning to step down amid the company's troubles.
The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.4 per cent to 3,240.10, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent 
to 14,437.81.
Boeing, the US aircraft manufacturer and Dow component, rose 0.9 per cent to $83.70 as reports said the company 
had received a 200 jet order from budget airline operator Ryanair Holdings.
Shares in computer product maker Hewlett-Packard were 1.2 per cent higher to $21.28 as the UK's Serious Fraud 
Office said it had launched an investigation into Autonomy, the software maker, acquired by the company for $11bn 
in 2011.
The S&P 500 energy sector index was 0.2 per cent higher as benchmark crude prices rose.
Refiners including Valero Energy, which gained 3.4 per cent to $45.22, pared some of their losses after a recent 
sell-off.
Heading into Tuesday's trade, analysts at Barclays said the ten largest publicly traded independent refiners had lost 
a total market value of $5bn. They added that the declines may be due to investor concerns over the impact of an 
increase in biofuel prices.
Google lost 1 per cent to $826.78 as the internet search and advertising company agreed to pay $7m in a 
settlement with 38 US states for violating privacy rights.
VeriFone rose 5.6 per cent to $21.61 a day after the electronics payments services company said its longstanding 
chief executive would step down. The company, which has lost 26.8 per cent from the start of the year, recently 
acknowledged that it had struggled in shifting from hardware-based business into software services.
John Williams, analyst at UBS, said the management change should be a reason for investors to reconsider its 
shares: "Investors who were uncomfortable with management may not take a fresh look."

New owner sets out Stansted's growth plan

Charlie Cornish is determined to return passenger numbers at Stansted to pre-recession levels over the next five 
years - or at least get close. Whether he eventually wants those travellers taking off from one runway or two is 
another question.
The chief executive of Manchester Airports Group on Thursday completed his £1.5bn purchase of London's third 
biggest airport by passenger numbers - a ranking the facility still keeps despite an annual traffic fall of more than a 
quarter since 2007, to slightly more than 17m passengers a year.
Mr Cornish blames that fall as much on increased landing charges as the wider economy, and plans to "enter into 
commercial discussions with airlines" promptly. "Our strategy will be geared around incentivising growth," he says, 
laying out a 2018 passenger target of 22.5m.
In the near term, the growth strategy will be based firmly on Stansted's historic customer base: the point-to-point 
leisure traveller with a budget airline ticket to a European destination. But MAG - which also owns Manchester, East 
Midlands and Bournemouth airports - hopes eventually to attract a wider variety of carriers and their customers, 
including those flying long-distance routes and offering first and business-class cabins.
Mr Cornish believes Stansted's catchment area, within a two-hour drive of the airport, will support that richer mix. 
But he is reluctant to push for a bigger catchment, via either investment in the train link to central London - to 
shorten journey times - or a pitch for Stansted becoming a hub airport rather than, or in addition to, Heathrow, 
whose parent company sold Stansted.
New owner sets out Stansted's growth plan
Those ideas, he says, would need instead to be backed by the Davies commission, the independent team asked by 
prime minister David Cameron to look into airport capacity in the south-east of England. And while MAG will be 
submitting material to the commission, its current position is the one formulated before it won Stansted: that 
regional airports can be part of the solution.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair and thereby Stansted's biggest customer, has stronger opinions. He 
argued last year that London needed three new runways, and predicted the first would be built at Stansted, the 
second at Heathrow and the third at Gatwick.
Of a second Stansted runway, Mr Cornish says: "At this stage, it would be difficult to rule it in or out."
His plans for the airport's retail space and parking are more concrete. At the moment the security barrier for 
departing passengers bisects the terminal lengthwise. MAG plans to move it closer to the entry doors - because 
check-in desks need less space in the era of print-at-home tickets - creating more space for shopping and dining 
after security.
That change will be part of £40m the company has devoted to improving retail over the next two years. Plans are 
also afoot to introduce first or business-class car parks, and to benefit from being part of a group of airports by co-
ordinating the facilities' supply chains.
His lack of ambition for big-ticket projects will be a relief to airlines, which fund airport improvements through take-
off and landing fees. "Stansted is a well-invested airport," he says. "It's a fairly simple airport. It doesn't need a lot of 
capital expenditure in the next 10 to 20 years".
To fund the Stansted acquisition, MAG struck a deal with Industry Funds Management of Australia in which the 
Australian group will buy into MAG, taking a 35.5 per cent equity stake and 50 per cent of voting rights.
That dilutes the holdings and voting rights of Manchester City Council and nine other local councils, from 55 per 
cent to 35 per cent in the case of Manchester City Council's equity stake, and from 45 to 30 per cent for the other 
councils. Manchester will keep a 50 per cent voting share, while the other councils will give up their voting rights.
Mr Cornish says he expects IFM, which holds stakes in nine Australian airports, to be a supportive partner with a 
similar investment philosophy. It will have two representatives on the board, which will "in many respects . . . have a 
governance structure similar to a [publicly listed company], with a rich mix of executives".
Board support might be particularly useful when dealing with customers such as Ryanair. The airline said on 
Thursday that it planned to shrink its traffic into and out of Stansted by 9 per cent this year, in retaliation for a fare 
rise that had been proposed by the airport's former owner.

Just 13 months have passed since Malev went bankrupt, consigning the 66-year-old Hungarian flag carrier airline to 
history. Now the race is on to prevent the same fate befalling a bigger and even older name: Lot, the Polish national 
airline.
The state-owned carrier is due to present a restructuring plan this month, expected to include big lay-offs and a 
reshaping of the company and its routes. The plan follows Lot's plea last December for as much as 1bn zlotys 
($315m) in aid, with the government agreeing to an emergency 400m zlotys cash injection - and firing the chief 
executive, Marcin Pirog.
But Malev's and Lot's problems are mirrored at lossmaking airlines across "emerging" Europe: The Czech 
government has since November renewed efforts to sell Czech Airlines (CSA), with Korean Air Lines and Qatar 
Airways showing interest, but no guarantee of a deal; Latvia's Air Baltic advertised a 50 per cent stake for sale in 
the Financial Times last August; Estonia's government has said closing Estonian Air is an option; and Serbia has 
tried to tempt Abu Dhabi-based Etihad to buy Jat Airways.
In western Europe, flag carriers have largely, though not all, been consolidated by a few large groups - notably 
Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, and British Airways and Iberia parent International Airlines Group. Further east, they 
remain almost entirely unconsolidated, and often state-dominated.
Though state-owned airlines can be inefficient and poorly run at the best of times, those that came out of the 
communist world had a particularly awkward legacy. Often they have been kept alive since by bailouts awarded on 
political rather than commercial grounds. National airlines were, after all, an important badge of nationhood for 
sometimes newly independent countries.
Emerging Europe airlines head for hangar
That has made it all the more difficult to cope with the extended European slowdown coupled with continually rising 
fuel prices. And they are stranded in the aviation equivalent of no-man's-land.
On one side, they face competition from agile and thrifty low-cost airlines - not just EasyJet and Ryanair, but 
homegrown competition such as Hungary-based Wizz Air. Ryanair was swift to fill at least part of the gap at 
Budapest's Ferenc Liszt airport left by Malev's bankruptcy.
On the other, European mega-carriers suck central European passengers into their west European hubs for long-
haul flights. Emirates, Qatar and others are starting to do the same on Asian routes.
In the EU's "new" states, moreover, membership has been distinctly double-edged for airlines. Competition rules 
restrict governments' ability to hand out state aid. A European Commission demand last year to pay back 
EUR332m of aid finally brought Malev crashing to earth. Brussels in December began probing aid to Air Baltic and 
Slovenia's Adria Airways, and last month aid to Estonian Air - and must still approve aid to Lot.
Then there is the rule that non-EU airlines cannot own EU carriers. That scuppered a potential tie-up of Lot with 
Turkish Airlines last June. With west European carriers busy consolidating their previous acquisitions, that rule is a 
big hurdle for those potentially most interested in acquiring central European airlines: middle eastern or Asian 
airlines in search of European hubs.
Without a market upturn, or painful restructuring - or both - several more central and eastern European carriers risk 
following Malev into the aviation history books. And National airlines are, in fact, more than just symbols of 
statehood. Not having one, and hence losing direct flights to trading partners, can have real costs, as Hungary has 
found. But governments can no longer afford to subsidise them - even were Brussels to allow it. Poland's premier 
Donald Tusk has declared that the government is not prepared to save Lot "at any cost".
There are still strategic niches to be exploited; the company that owns Prague airport and CSA Czech Airlines has 
had some success turning Prague into a hub for the former Soviet Union and points east. But sweeping 
restructuring is needed, if only to get these airlines in shape to interest West European carriers once they return to 
buying. Sub-regional consolidation needs to happen, too. A single Baltic airline would make sense, as would 
merging carriers from former Yugoslav states.
Cutting jobs, capacity and routes is politically tricky - as is meaningful co-operation between states that two 
decades ago were at war. But Malev now stands as a cautionary tale. The political cost of getting national airlines 
into shape to survive, even as part of much bigger groups - so safeguarding national airports, too - is probably a lot 
less than the fallout from seeing them fail.

Iberia charge pushes IAG to EUR997m loss

International Airlines Group swung to a pre-tax loss of EUR997m for 2012 after taking a EUR343m impairment 
charge on Iberia, its troubled Spanish subsidiary.
The loss announced on Thursday was also due to a EUR202m restructuring charge at Iberia, which is embarking 
on a turnround plan strongly opposed by trade unions.
IAG was formed in 2011 through the merger of British Airways and Iberia, and Willie Walsh, chief executive, 
insisted the Spanish airline must "adapt to survive".
"It must stem its cash losses and adjust its cost base permanently if it is to compete with other airlines in all its 
strategic markets and lay the foundations for profitable growth in the future," he said.
IAG's EUR997m loss last year compared with a pre-tax profit of EUR503m in 2011.
The company said its operating loss of EUR23m before exceptional items for 2012 was better than previous 
guidance.
IAG added that, subject to the outcome of negotiations on the Iberia turnround plan, it expected to record a better 
operating profit before one-offs in 2013 than the EUR485m reported in 2011. In early London trading, IAG's shares 
were up 6 per cent at 235p.
Revenue rose 10.9 per cent to EUR18.1bn in 2012, partly due to IAG's joint venture with American Airlines on 
transatlantic routes.
Iberia charge pushes IAG to EUR997m loss
British Airways reported an operating profit of EUR295m in 2012, down from EUR592m in 2011. Iberia's operating 
loss widened from EUR61m in 2011 to EUR896m last year, including the impairment charge.
The EUR343m charge at Iberia involves writing down all EUR249m of goodwill associated with the acquisition of 
the Spanish airline by British Airways in 2011. The charge also covers Iberia's brand and other intangible assets.
Iberia is proposing to cut 3,800 jobs under a new turnround plan outlined this month after failing to reach agreement 
with unions on an earlier proposal that involved reducing the workforce by 4,500, or 22 per cent.
The new plan also includes a 15 per cent cut in capacity, and unions promised 15 days of strikes in response.
As well as being hit by the Spanish recession, Iberia is struggling to compete with low-cost carriers led by Ryanair 
and new Latin American rivals such as Latam Airline Group.
IAG's results statement highlighted the risks associated with the Iberia turnround plan, saying: "Execution risks are 
high and include delayed implementation, widespread labour conflict, operational disruption, political interference, 
legal risk around testing new labour reforms and a lack of employee focus."
IAG's other exceptional items in 2012 included a EUR87m restructuring charge at BMI British Midland, the airline 
bought last year from Lufthansa. The deal gives British Airways a stronger presence at London's Heathrow airport.
Pension charges of EUR266m also contributed to IAG's EUR997m pre-tax loss. Net debt stood at EUR1.9bn at 
December 31, compared with EUR1.2bn in the previous year, because of IAG's weaker operating performance and 
increased capital expenditure on new aircraft.
Andrew Light, an analyst at Citi, said: "As expected, the poor performance of Iberia undermined the good 
performance of British Airways."

International Airlines Group swung to a pre-tax loss of EUR997m last year after taking a EUR343m impairment 
charge on Iberia, its troubled Spanish subsidiary.
IAG was formed in 2011 through the merger of British Airways and Iberia, and Willie Walsh, chief executive, 
admitted the 2012 results were "very disappointing".
Iberia is embarking on a turnround plan that is strongly opposed by trade unions, but Mr Walsh insisted the Spanish 
airline must "adapt to survive".
He held out the possibility that the Spanish airline could go beyond its plan to cut 3,800 jobs and reduce capacity by 
15 per cent. "If there is further capacity reduction there well may be further job reductions," he said.
IAG's EUR997m loss in the year to December 31 compared with a pre-tax profit of EUR503m in 2011.
British Airways reported an operating profit of EUR295m in 2012, down from EUR592m in 2011. Iberia's operating 
loss widened from EUR61m in 2011 to EUR896m last year, including charges of EUR545m that related to 
restructuring and impairment.
The EUR343m impairment involves writing off all EUR249m of goodwill stemming from British Airways' acquisition 
of Iberia under accounting rules.
Iberia's shareholders secured 44 per cent of IAG's equity in the all-stock combination, and Mr Walsh rejected 
suggestions that British Airways had in effect overpaid for the Spanish airline.
Iberia charge pushes IAG to EUR997m loss
IAG's shares rose 7.7 per cent to 238.7p after the group said that, subject to the outcome of negotiations with 
unions on the Iberia turnround plan, it expected to record a better operating profit before exceptional items in 2013 
than the EUR485m reported in 2011.
Mr Walsh also said IAG was sticking to its target of generating EUR1.6bn of operating profit by 2015 but added it 
may be secured "in a slightly different way".
In November, IAG said British Airways would generate EUR1.3bn of operating profit in 2015, implying that Iberia 
would contribute EUR300m.
Iberia is proposing to cut 3,800 jobs, or 19 per cent of the workforce, under its latest turnround plan after failing to 
reach agreement with unions on an earlier proposal that involved up to 4,500 redundancies.
Unions have responded by organising 15 days of strikes, which are costing Iberia about EUR3m each day.
As well as being hit by the Spanish recession, Iberia is struggling to compete with low-cost carriers led by Ryanair 
and new Latin American rivals such as Latam Airline Group.
For 2012, IAG's revenue rose 10.9 per cent to EUR18.1bn, partly because of British Airways' joint venture with 
American Airlines on transatlantic routes. The group's fuel costs rose 20.4 per cent to EUR6.1bn.
IAG's exceptional items also included a EUR87m restructuring charge at BMI British Midland, the airline bought last 
year from Lufthansa and now integrated with British Airways. Pension charges of EUR266m also contributed to the 
group's pre-tax loss.
Net debt increased to EUR1.9bn at December 31, from EUR1.2bn in the previous year.
Gross cash fell 22.1 per cent to EUR2.9bn because of IAG's weaker operating performance and increased capital 
expenditure on new aircraft.

Brussels formally vetoed Ryanair's latest takeover attempt for Aer Lingus on Thursday arguing it raised "very 
serious competition problems", in the first ever case of the EU blocking a proposed merger twice.
Joaquín Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner, said he had no choice but to block a deal that "would have 
directly harmed passengers who would have had to pay higher fares as a result".
Ryanair, which has mounted three failed bids for the Irish flag carrier in eight years, denounced the move as 
"manifestly unjust" and politically inspired "to pander to the vested interests of the Irish government".
It is appealing against the decision, which will set a new precedent in Brussels and leave Ryanair accounting for 
almost 10 per cent of all EU merger prohibitions. Ryanair was unsuccessful in challenging the EU's 2007 
prohibition, which was upheld by the courts.
In his latest bid to win over Brussels, Michael O'Leary put forward a "revolutionary" package of competition 
remedies, which involved the de facto break-up of Aer Lingus.
While this went well beyond past offers to win EU clearance for an airline merger, the European Commission still 
concluded the tie-up raised fundamental competition problems that would probably short-change consumers on 
choice and price.
The commission investigation found that a combined Ryanair and Aer Lingus group would have an even more 
dominant position in Dublin than in 2007, with an 87 per cent market share and a monopoly position on 46 routes.
EU blocks Ryanair - Aer Lingus merger
Mr Almunia said the four sets of remedies proposed were "important" and attempted to address all the problematic 
routes. But he said the core issue remained - "the creation of a monopoly with a dominant position on these 46 
routes".
Brussels was unconvinced that Ryanair's remedies would prove viable, particularly given the risks around its offer 
to hand Flybe, the lossmaking UK regional airline, the right to operate about 40 per cent of Aer Lingus's short-haul 
routes out of Ireland.
Even though Ryanair proposed giving Flybe's Irish business at least nine aircraft and EUR100m in cash, the 
commission was not satisfied that it would have the financial muscle or experience to compete effectively with the 
low-cost carrier in its home market.
It was also not satisfied by Ryanair's offer to make slots available so IAG, the owner of British Airways, could 
operate London routes from Dublin, Shannon and Cork for at least three years. The investigation found that post-
merger Ryanair would still have remained dominant in terms of numbers and frequency of seat capacity. The 
Commission also had doubts over IAG's long-term commitment to these routes.
Ryanair lambasted the commission for singling it out while it was "rubber stamping" every other European airline 
merger with "considerably fewer and less effective remedies" than it proposed.
"Ryanair regrets that the EU commission has again failed to apply its own competition rules and precedents in a fair 
and dispassionate manner," said Ryanair. "We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political 
interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and 
overturning this politically-inspired prohibition."
Ryanair's long quest to control Aer Lingus has already proved painful and costly. Mr O'Leary spent EUR407m to 
become Aer Lingus's largest shareholder, but has written down the value of that stake to EUR80m.
Aer Lingus accused Ryanair of launching its third takeover bid as a legal ruse to stymie the competition commission 
probe into whether Ryanair's stake served to weaken Aer Lingus as a competitor. The investigation was launched 
days before the bid.
Ryanair could potentially be forced by the UK regulator to sell its stake and realise a heavy loss, but it is likely to 
take several years to reach this point given Mr O'Leary's willingness to prolong litigation.
The European Commission is also considering whether it should change its rules on minority shareholdings. 
Brussels currently has the power to unwind mergers, but cannot order the sale of a minority stake.
Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus chief executive, said: "Aer Lingus's position from the outset has been that Ryanair's 
offer should never have been made. The series of inadequate remedy offers presented by Ryanair only underlines 
the view that Ryanair made its offer without any reasonable belief that it could obtain clearance."

The second-hand market for narrow-body commercial aircraft is forecast to remain buoyant over the coming 
decade, in spite of strong demand from airlines for new, more fuel efficient models due to enter service in three or 
four years' time.
This is in contrast to past shifts to new models, for example in the 2000s, when the value of second-hand Boeing 
narrow-body jets fell amid a transition by airlines to the US manufacturer's "next-generation" aircraft.
Airbus Neo and Boeing Max models, which both boast about a 15 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency, "are 
essentially re-engined aircraft. They have similar seat numbers and the same range as their predecessors, which 
makes the switchover much less disruptive," said Lucas Mollan, chief technical officer at Avolon, the aircraft leasing 
company, and author of a paper on the upcoming transition. "Airlines will be able to 'bleed' these models into their 
existing fleets."
The Avolon paper also found that the effect of the Neo and Max models on the value of their predecessors will be 
limited by the sheer number of current-generation craft in use today and the high portion of the global aircraft fleet 
approaching retirement. "A deep and renewable pool of ageing aircraft will be available to absorb the replacement 
element of new deliveries, expected to average 40 per cent of the total over the next decade."
Mr Mollan and Dick Forsberg, Avalon's head of strategy, argued that the greatest risk to an orderly transition was 
Airbus and Boeing ramping up production of the Neos and Maxes or failing to moderate production of older models 
at an appropriate rate - both because of the strain this could put on a supply chain already stretched at the moment 
and because of the possibility of it creating a glut in the market.
Sales of used commercial jets buoyant
Some airlines are already hoping to strike deals on current-generation aircraft, with many aviation experts expecting 
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, to put in an order soon for current generation Boeings rather than 
Maxes.
The Irish low-cost carrier and its UK-based rival easyJet are both looking this year at increasing their fleets to 
accommodate growth in passenger numbers, but are keen not to overspend in a period of moderating traffic growth 
in Europe.
The Avolon authors predict that sharper rises in passenger numbers in developing countries will fuel demand for 
both Neo and Max models, but also, importantly, current-generation aircraft as airlines seek to add capacity but find 
themselves at the end of long lines for the new models. Both Airbus and Boeing currently have record-high order 
backlogs, making the second-hand market an appealing option for fast-growing carriers.

Lufthansa on Tuesday proposed suspending dividend payments after reporting a 36 per cent fall in operating profit 
in 2012.
Europe's largest airline by sales said last year's EUR524m operating profit had been affected by restructuring 
charges, adding that it would intensify its effort to secure cost savings. Revenue rose 4.9 per cent to EUR30.1bn in 
2012.
Lufthansa will record a net profit of EUR990m for last year, compared to a loss of EUR13m in 2011 - but the airline 
said the 2012 result had been flattered by one-off items. These included selling part of Lufthansa's stake in 
Amadeus, a company running an airline booking system.
Lufthansa's executive board recommended a suspension of dividend payments so that the group could increase its 
equity capital. The company last suspended its dividend in 2009.
Christoph Franz, Lufthansa's chief executive, described the airline's performance as "good" given the industry 
environment.
"In order to successfully meet the changes in the aviation industry, however, we need to perform even better," he 
added.
Some European flag carriers have struggled with the fragile economic environment, particularly at their short-haul 
operations, which face constant pressure from budget carriers led by Ryanair and easyJet.
Lufthansa to suspend dividends
Lufthansa has a cost-cutting programme under which the group has an operating profit target of EUR2.3bn for 2014 
- which would be a EUR1.5bn improvement on 2011.
Savings will be found partly by cutting 3,500 administrative jobs, or 3 per cent of the group's workforce, and 
Lufthansa on Tuesday announced plans to close the airline's Cologne head office as part of this programme.
Lufthansa's executive board also recommended the purchase of 100 short-haul and eight long-haul aircraft, worth 
EUR9bn at list prices, although deals with passenger jet makers have not been finalised.
Lufthansa will publish its full results for 2012 on March 14. It released a summary on Tuesday.

Many hearts and minds may have been occupied by Valentine's day this week, but the corporate world provided 
plenty of distraction for others. If any doubts about the return of the big deal remained, they were dispelled by 
Warren Buffett and 3G Capital taking Heinz private in a $28bn deal. Results from the world's biggest foodmaker, 
Nestlé, were perhaps less exciting, but the company once again proved that it can consistently deliver growth. 
Drinkmakers were also busy with AB InBev offering concessions to US authorities in the hope they will soon 
approve its $20bn offer for the 50 per cent of Mexico's Grupo Modelo that it does not already own. Fellow brewer 
Heineken's results were dragged down by weak European beer sales while Coca-Cola reported slightly weaker-
than-expected growth. In the cosmetics segment, struggling Avon showed promising signs of a turnround under its 
new CEO as L'Oréal chose to return EUR500m of its EUR1.6bn in cash to shareholders rather than use it to buy 
emerging markets exposure.
Most of the rest of the action involved heavy machinery. American Airlines and US Airways stole the limelight with 
an $11bn merger to create one of the world's biggest airlines. Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Ryanair, was stifled 
by European regulators in its third attempt in eight years to take over rival Aer Lingus. Jet engine maker Rolls-
Royce is doing better than most airlines as it reported a 24 per cent jump in full-year profits. Another industrial giant, 
GE, found itself with $10bn to spend on share buybacks after selling its 49 per cent stake in NBCUniversal for 
$18.1bn. Italy's second largest industrial company, Finmeccanica, had been showing signs of improvement lately, 
but the arrest of its CEO in a corruption probe is a big setback. The automotive industry has also been a wreck 
recently as Peugeot's EUR5bn loss in 2012 demonstrates. But if you have to be exposed to the sector, tyremakers 
may be the best bet as both Michelin and Goodyear have weathered the storm better than most carmakers.
Finally, the banks. Société Générale has enjoyed the rally since July more than most European banks, but full year 
numbers showed it will be difficult to maintain that outperformance. In the UK, Barclays' CEO outlined his much-
anticipated vision for the bank's future, which it turns out is not that radically different from its recent past.

Brussels is planning to block Ryanair's takeover bid for Aer Lingus as anti-competitive, according to a draft decision 
that will thwart Michael O'Leary's third tilt at the Irish flag carrier.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue, said on Tuesday it had been informed at a "state of play" 
meeting with the European Commission that Brussels "intends to prohibit Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus".
Ryanair said it had met every competition concern raised by the Commission, and "has today instructed its lawyers 
to appeal any prohibition decision to the European courts".
The Irish government had raised objections to Ireland's main two airlines combining, and Robin Kiely, a Ryanair 
spokesman, said: "This decision [by Brussels] is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the 
Irish government and is not based on competition law."
The Commission declined to comment.
If the Commission's draft decision is approved by the college of EU commissioners in coming weeks, the deal will 
make history as the first time Brussels has vetoed a proposed merger twice.
Ryanair's first attempted takeover of Aer Lingus was blocked in 2007; a second bid was withdrawn by the low-cost 
carrier in 2009 after the Irish government opposed it.
Brussels moves to bar Ryanair's Aer Lingus bid
After the third takeover bid was tabled last June, Mr O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, put forward a 
"revolutionary" package of so-called "remedies" - involving the de facto break-up of Aer Lingus - in an attempt to 
assuage Brussels' deep-set anti-trust objections.
While the concessions go well beyond anything offered in the past to win EU clearance for an airline deal, the 
Commission still concluded the tie-up raised serious competition problems.
One central concern with Ryanair's remedies to preserve competition is the viability of its offer to give Flybe, the 
loss-making regional UK airline, the right to operate 43 of Aer Lingus' short-haul routes out of Ireland.
Even though Ryanair proposed giving Flybe's Irish business at least nine aircraft and EUR100m in cash, rivals 
questioned whether it would have the financial clout or assets to compete effectively with the low-cost carrier in its 
home market. Flybe has issued several profit warnings since its flotation in 2010.
Separately, the Commission also raised doubts about Ryanair's plan for addressing the reduction in competition on 
Aer Lingus' lucrative London routes.
Ryanair proposed that British Airways operate services between London's Gatwick airport and Dublin, Shannon and 
Cork.
BA would also be offered a majority of Aer Lingus' slots at London's Heathrow airport, once Ryanair could secure 
approval from the Irish flag carrier's shareholders for the transaction.
The Commission rarely uses its power to prohibit business combinations and has vetoed only 23 deals since 
merger control rules were introduced.
However, a veto would be the second big deal halted this year alone by Joaquin Almunia, the EU's competition 
commissioner, who last month vetoed a tie-up between the delivery groups UPS and TNT.
Both Mr O'Leary and Mr Almunia have been uncharacteristically reticent to discuss the prospects of winning EU 
clearance in public.
Ryanair is almost certain to appeal any prohibition - a threat that has made the Commission extra-wary of making 
mistakes in the investigation.
The airline has the right to submit additional concessions up until a decision is formally announced on March 6.

Ever watched an airline passenger trying to cram an impossibly large bag into overhead luggage space? It feels a 
lot like that as Ryanair, in its third effort to take over rival Aer Lingus, seeks antitrust solutions to the carriers' near 
90-per cent share of short-haul routes into and out of Ireland. The current plan is to give 43 routes to Flybe, and 
provide the British discount carrier with EUR100m to set up bases in Dublin and Cork. IAG, meanwhile, is lined up 
to take over AL's Gatwick slots (or, if the Irish government ever permits, those at Heathrow). Formally, competition 
officials in Brussels have until March 6 to rule; in reality, an internal decision could be made this week.
For all the pushing and shoving, big problems persist. For a start, the business to be divested to Flybe isn't one. It is 
a collection of routes which needs to morph into a coherent unit. That would only happen months after any bid 
completed, during which time Ryanair would run the show (presumably with regulators' oversight). Secondly, 
Flybe's capacity to compete with Ryanair long-term is questionable. Market capitalisation is £50m; net debt (as of 
September) similar; consensus forecasts are for a small net loss in the year to March. The gifted EUR100m, 
moreover, would not ultimately be ringfenced from group finances. Flybe also has (limited) scope to drop acquired 
AL routes, which could put Ryanair in a monopoly position on some city pairs. (The bidder argues that this can 
happen anyway through route churn.) Most bizarrely, the AL brand could live on with Flybe and Ryanair both using 
it differently - not least, in the latter's case, to run AL's Irish Heathrow routes in competition with its own existing 
Stansted ones.
Aer Lingus' shares, at EUR1.37 and on a 12 times forward multiple, now top Ryanair's earlier bid price. That partly 
reflects effective performance. The flag carrier should be allowed to continue delivering just that.

A bear raid left Cupid among the small-cap casualties this week.
The online dating specialist declined 26.1 per cent after a post on an investment blog questioned its revenue 
reporting and highlighted transactions with companies owned by management.
Cupid responded that it was trading in line with expectations and knew of "no material reason" for the share price 
weakness.
Peel Hunt, the company's broker, said "We can find . . . nothing that concerns us."
Plethora Solutions, the developer of treatments for urological disorders, dropped 67.5 per cent after warning it was 
in urgent talks with third parties to meet its immediate working capital needs.
Oil explorer RusPetro fell 21 per cent after postponing a $350m bond issue that was required to meet a funding 
shortfall and repay debt owed to Sberbank. The  bond was pulled pending an update from its Siberian field and an 
independent audit.
"We estimate a $75m equity raise would provide RusPetro with enough financial headroom to be comfortably 
funded through 2013," said RBC.
Flybe jumped 25.3 per cent after Ryanair provisionally agreed to transfer some routes and aircraft to its smaller 
rival, along with a dowry of EUR100m, in the hope of securing European Commission approval for its Aer Lingus 
bid.

Aer Lingus on Wednesday restated its opposition to Ryanair's proposed takeover of the Irish flag carrier, as it 
reported a 41 per cent rise in underlying operating profit in 2012 and raised its dividend.
With the European Commission reviewing Ryanair's third attempt to secure control of Aer Lingus, the flag carrier 
said: "The board continues to be completely opposed to the Ryanair offer. We believe it represents poor value for 
shareholders."
This statement came as Flybe, the UK regional airline, disclosed a planned new subsidiary should generate a 
EUR20m pre-tax profit in its first year of operation under an agreement with Ryanair that is intended to help secure 
its takeover of Aer Lingus.
Flybe has agreed in principle to establish the Irish subsidiary, which would run 43 short-haul routes out of Ireland 
that are currently operated by Aer Lingus.
Aer Lingus disclosed it had spent EUR9.8m last year on legal and other fees to oppose Ryanair's offer, made in 
June, to pay EUR1.3 per share for the Irish flag carrier, valuing its equity at EUR694m.
Aer Lingus went on to outline a case for continuing to operate as an independent airline by highlighting several 
"medium-term" growth opportunities, including the possibility of buying more take-off and landing slots at London's 
Heathrow airport, where it is the third-largest airline.
Aer Lingus reported revenue of EUR1.4bn for the 12 months to December 31, up 8.2 per cent compared with 2011, 
and underlying operating profit of EUR69.1m, up 40.7 per cent.
Aer Lingus continues to fend off Ryanair
Pre-tax profit fell 51.9 per cent to EUR40.6m because of exceptional items, which included the cost of restructuring 
aircraft maintenance operations.
Aer Lingus also disclosed a defined benefit pension scheme which some of its past and current employees are 
members of had a large deficit of EUR779m at December 31.
Aer Lingus has proposed a new defined contribution scheme for its employees, but no agreement has so far been 
reached with trade unions.
However, Aer Lingus underlined its confidence in its future by proposing a dividend of EUR0.04 per share for 2012, 
up from EUR0.03 in 2011.
Meanwhile, Flybe, which reported a pre-tax loss of £6.2m in 2011-12, outlined further terms of its proposed deal 
with Ryanair.
The planned transaction underlines the determination of Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, to secure 
control of Aer Lingus.
The European Commission has expressed concerns about the negative consequences for competition if Ireland's 
two main airlines are allowed to combine, and Ryanair is responding by persuading other carriers to provide 
alternative services.
Ryanair has agreed to pay EUR100m in cash to a Flybe subsidiary that would operate services on about 40 per 
cent of Aer Lingus's existing routes.
Flybe said this subsidiary should generate a pre-tax profit of EUR20m in its first year of operation, and Jim French, 
chief executive, added the plan was consistent with the regional airline's strategy to "diversify away from reliance 
upon the UK economy".

Ryanair has offered regional airline Flybe Group EUR100m to operate some Aer Lingus routes out of Ireland, in a 
renewed attempt to convince the European Commission not to block its takeover bid for the Irish flag carrier.
Flybe on Tuesday confirmed that Ryanair, Europe's largest budget carrier by revenues, had agreed in principle to 
contribute EUR100m and as many as 10 aircraft to a new Flybe subsidiary, should the takeover of Aer Lingus gain 
regulatory approval.
The subsidiary would then operate about 40 per cent of Aer Lingus's short-haul routes, in an effort to 
circumnavigate concerns over a perceived lack of competition on routes to and from Ireland, should Ryanair gain 
control of the Irish national carrier.
The deal would provide a substantial boost for Flybe, the lossmaking regional carrier that operates about 180 routes 
from 65 European airports. Flybe shares rose 5 per cent to 48p in early trading, while Ryanair was unchanged at 
EUR5.62.
"The implementation of any agreement would be dependent on the status of Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus; the 
outcome of the commission's deliberations on the competition aspects of Ryanair's bid; and the agreement of a 
timetable for the implementation of the proposed remedies," said Flybe.
The deal is far from certain, however, given Ryanair's previous failure to secure European regulatory approval for 
its previous two bids for Aer Lingus.
Ryanair offers Flybe EUR100m to operate Aer Lingus routes
The European Commission has objected to Ryanair's most recent bid on competition grounds, arguing that it 
creates a monopoly on about 46 routes, and antitrust problems on a further 20.
It prohibited Ryanair's first bid for Aer Lingus in 2006 - and Brussels regulators have never cleared a merger that 
they have previously rejected.
Last month, Ryanair unveiled a package of concessions intended to address competition concerns, including Flybe 
acquiring Aer Lingus operations on 23 routes where the merger would create a monopoly.
Ryanair owns roughly 30 per cent of Aer Lingus and in June renewed attempts to gain full control. The European 
Commission is expected to rule on Ryanair's EUR694m offer by March 6.
Aer Lingus is due to release its 2012 results on Wednesday.

Dropping air passenger duty would provide a sizeable lift to the UK economy, the aviation industry said, as it 
stepped up its campaign against the tax ahead of the chancellor's Budget next month.
A report commissioned by the country's four biggest airlines said the economic benefit of abolishing the tax would 
add 0.46 per cent to gross domestic product in its first year. The boost from the disappearance of the tax, which 
adds £13 to every short-haul economy class ticket and £65 to business and first class seats, would more than make 
up for lost Treasury revenues, it said.
But a Treasury spokesperson said APD, which is forecast to bring in £2.9bn this year, makes an "essential 
contribution" towards helping meet the government's deficit reduction plans.
"We do not recognise the figures in this report or agree with the assumptions behind it," the Treasury said.
PwC, which undertook the study, estimated that increased tourism and private investment would lead to a short-
term boost while job creation and higher productivity would produce "a small but permanent GDP gain".
The scale of the uplift would fall to a 0.11 per cent impact by years nine and 10, but the absence of the tax would 
continue to reap benefits - such as lower benefits payments and higher corporation tax receipts - that would 
outweigh the costs, PwC argues.
"A lot of this is about the ability to connect to other markets," said Michael Burns, head of aviation at the 
consultancy. "We know the levels of APD have had an impact on travel, especially long-haul travel."
Airlines step up fight over passenger duty
Paul Moore, a spokesman for easyJet, one of the airlines that commissioned the study - alongside British Airways, 
Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic - argued APD was on the same level as corporation tax in terms of its leverage on 
economic activity: "If the chancellor is looking to stimulate growth, APD is something to consider."
The airlines have joined their lobbying efforts over the tax, and are calling for scrapping it entirely rather than 
tweaking it. But the research also examined the case for less drastic measures, and found that the deeper the cut to 
APD, the greater the benefit to the economy.
It suggested reducing APD by £1 would produce a bigger boost to GDP than the same reduction in VAT, income 
tax, national insurance or corporation tax. Only fuel duty offered more leverage, according to PwC.
But the report also found that by encouraging foreign travel by UK residents, abolishing APD would mean some 
parts of the economy would suffer even if the overall impact on GDP was positive.
"The outflow [of UK consumers' pounds] is partially offset by expenditure from foreign inbound tourists . . . [but they] 
tend to purchase a more limited range of lower value-added goods and services than domestic consumers," the 
study said.

Ryanair increased its profits outlook for the full year after strong demand for flights in the run-up to Christmas 
boosted fares for Europe's largest low-cost airline.
The airline, which is in the midst of trying to secure European approval for its takeover bid for Ireland's flag carrier, 
Aer Lingus, said it now expected full-year profits to come close to EUR540m, compared to its previous guidance of 
EUR490m to EUR520m.
The group on Monday reported third-quarter net income of EUR18m, up 21 per cent on last year. Revenues in the 
quarter rose 15 per cent to EUR969m, with passenger traffic rising 3 per cent.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said average fares jumped 8 per cent in the quarter, thanks to 
"improved customer service, record punctuality and the successful rollout of our reserved seating service".
Ryanair shares slipped about 2 per cent in early trading to EUR5.39.
Analysts at Investec said that Ryanair's trading had been "very impressive", arguing the introduction of reserved 
seating on the low-cost airline appeared to have gone "extremely well", boosting ancillary revenues by 24 per cent 
year on year.
Separately on Monday, Ryanair said it had submitted a "radical and unprecedented" package of possible remedies 
to the European Union regarding its proposed takeover of Aer Lingus.
Demand boosts Ryanair 's profits outlook
The Financial Times reported earlier this month that Ryanair had offered to sell about 40 per cent of Aer Lingus' 
short-haul operations to Flybe, the UK regional airline, addressing concerns around 23 routes where the proposed 
merger would create a monopoly.
In addition, British Airways - part of International Airlines Group - would be given the right to buy about half of Aer 
Lingus's prized Heathrow slots, which are used for services to Dublin, Shannon and Cork.
Mr O'Leary is trying to combine the Irish airlines for the third time in seven years. Brussels blocked his first bid for 
Aer Lingus in 2006 and regulators have already rejected Ryanair's first two attempts to address competition 
concerns raised by the deal.
Ryanair said on Monday that it opened its 51st base at Maastrict in December and planned 6 new operations from 
April at Eindhoven, Krakow, Zadar, Chania, Marrakesh and Fez.
"Significant capacity cuts by legacy and other struggling EU carriers continue to offer us substantial growth 
opportunities across Europe," the company said, adding that it expected further capacity cuts and restructurings by 
struggling airlines in Europe.
EasyJet, which is Europe's second-largest low-cost carrier by revenues behind Ryanair, said earlier this month that 
cuts to capacity by competitors had helped boost its first-quarter revenues. The airline has also been wooing 
business travellers away from full-service rivals such as British Airways and Lufthansa with flexible tickets and 
allocated seating.

Transocean jumped on news that activist investor Carl Icahn was poised to apply pressure on the owner and 
operator of the Deepwater Horizon.
Mr Icahn increased his stake to 5.6 per cent and called on the Swiss group to declare a minimum dividend of $4 per 
share. The shares rallied 4.2 per cent to SFr54.10.
"If Icahn gets his way, the dividend payment will amount to about $1.5bn and will make a significant dent in 
Transocean's cash reserves," Gavan Nolan, analyst at Markit, warned.
Tobacco company Swedish Match received a fillip from Chevreux after analysts moved it from their "outperform" 
basket to their "selected list". The shares climbed 3.4 per cent to SKr241.60
Investors reacted to negotiations over a shake-up of shareholder structure at EADS. Tom Enders, chief executive, 
sought to fend off political pressure over who would be the next chairperson at the weekend. The shares gained 2.7 
per cent to EUR35.74.
In Athens Greek regulators agreed to scrap a short selling ban on shares, with the exception of banking stocks.
"I don't think lifting the ban will have any significant market impact at this point in the cycle," said Achilles Risvas, 
chief executive at Dromeus Capital, a hedge fund that aims to profit from a Greek recovery.
The Athens General index fell 0.1 per cent to 1,013.79.
Transocean jumps on dividend pressure
Spain's Inditex lost ground after the owner of the Zara brand said it would cease employing subcontractors in 
Bangladesh after officials found clothes with its labels in the wreckage from a deadly factory fire in December.
The shares fell 2.1 per cent to EUR105.05.
Ryanair sent jitters through the airline sector after it said it had seen some weakness in fares in January.
However, chief executive Michael O'Leary said he expected fares to recover over the next few months. The group 
also raised its full-year profit forecast.
The shares slipped 2.1 per cent to EUR5.39. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,172.99.

Who'd have believed it? Much of Europe is mired in a stop-start recession. Yet many European airline stocks are 
taking off like planes on a super-short runway. No one is enjoying this ride more than investors in the big low-cost 
carriers. Easyjet's shares - which have more than doubled during the past year - leapt 10 per cent last week alone. 
Those in Ryanair, reporting third quarter results today, have risen 17 per cent since late-December.
It all goes to show what a bit of capacity discipline - a lesson hard-learnt in previous recessions - can do. Across 
Europe, scheduled flight capacity probably contracted by 3 per cent from a year earlier in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
Within that overall figure, the decline in markets such as Germany and Spain has been more like 10 per cent. This 
reflects the recent demise of some carriers (Spanair, Italy's Wind Jet); restructuring by both legacy carriers 
(Lufthansa, IAG) and smaller players (Air Berlin); and some helpful moves by budget airlines themselves (Ryanair 
again parked aircraft recently). So load factors have remained high, and revenues per seat have grown. Easyjet, 
say, reported an 89 per load factor and 8 per cent year-on-year rise in revenues per seat in the fourth quarter of 
2012. On the cost side, oil prices, while high, have been stable and weather disruptions, modest.
The challenge for investors is to predict the flight path ahead. With restructuring by legacy carriers ongoing and the 
demise of more smaller fry possible, capacity growth should remain muted: Citibank anticipates a 2-3 per cent 
expansion in available seat kilometres in 2013. Costs continue to be pared, especially at flag carriers - witness the 
potential IAG-Vueling moves. So even the most generous earnings-based multiples - Easyjet is on 12 times 2013 
consensus earnings, Ryanair, 15 times - do not look excessive. Still cruising altitude may be approaching, so 
investors need to pick their seats with care.

International Airlines Group is eyeing a contentious plan to replace many of the European flights by British Airways 
and Iberia with services operated by Vueling, the Spanish low-cost carrier that IAG is proposing to buy.
IAG - formed through the merger of British Airways and Iberia in 2011 - could seek large cost savings by using 
Vueling to provide short-haul services currently done by its UK and Spanish airlines, said two people familiar with 
the group's thinking.
However, such a move would put IAG on a fresh collision course with trade unions representing pilots and cabin 
crew at British Airways and Iberia, who would resist any initiative to hand over work to Vueling.
Iberia is already braced for strikes as it attempts to reach agreement with unions by the company's January 31 
deadline about a proposed restructuring of the Spanish airline - its difficulties are expected to push IAG to an 
operating loss of EUR120m in 2012.
Against this background, IAG in November made an offer of EUR113m for the 54 per cent of Vueling that the group 
does not own - Iberia already has a 46 per cent stake in the Barcelona-based low-cost carrier.
The group highlighted how Vueling was growing profitably. It recorded net income of EUR41.3m in the nine months 
to September 30, up 93 per cent compared with the same period in 2011.
Two people close to IAG said the planned Vueling transaction formed part of the group's efforts to compete more 
effectively against low-cost carriers led by EasyJet and Ryanair.
IAG's Vueling plan risks union conflict
Although no final decisions have been taken, one person said British Airways' short-haul, point-to-point flights - 
including those based out of Gatwick airport - could be replaced by Vueling's services.
Similar arrangements could be put in place in Spain, so that Vueling replaces Iberia's short-haul services.
IAG declined to comment but unions would be certain to oppose Vueling's expansion in this way.
Pay and perks at Vueling are lower than at British Airways and Iberia. Credit Suisse analysts estimate labour costs 
at British Airways and Iberia represented 34 per cent and 35 per cent of operating expenses excluding fuel in 2012 
respectively, compared with 13 per cent at Vueling.

-Attention will focus on how far a sharp fall-off in European sales has hurt Ford Motor when the US's second-
biggest carmaker by sales announces its full-year results, writes Robert Wright.
The company, again solidly profitable in its US domestic market, has suffered some of the sharpest falls of any big 
carmaker as demand for new cars across Europe has fallen to levels last seen nearly 20 years ago.
The carmaker's December sales in its core European markets were 27 per cent down on December 2011, while 
sales across the continent for the year fell 13.2 per cent year on year. Analysts expect net income for the year to be 
12 per cent down on 2011 at $5.37bn, on revenue down 2.3 per cent to $125bn.-Yahoo's last results marked the 
The Week Ahead: January 28 - February 3
earnings-call debut of Marissa Mayer, the former Google executive appointed as the struggling web portal's chief in 
July, writes Tim Bradshaw.
Her strategy put mobile and "daily habits", such as checking news or sports scores, at the heart of a product-centric 
turnround. However, in addressing how to persuade people to spend more of their time with Yahoo, she had little to 
say about those who spend money there: advertisers.
After meeting with brands and agencies at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Ms Mayer's plans to 
galvanise Yahoo's search and display businesses may now be more fully formed. And they are badly needed: Mark 
Mahaney at RBC predicts growth of just 2 per cent in display and 3 per cent in search for the company's fourth-
quarter results, with $1.23bn in net revenue overall and $0.29 per share in earnings.

- Boeing is set to report solid fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on strong passenger jet deliveries, but few 
analysts are going to pay the results much attention, writes Neil Munshi.
Instead, their focus on Wednesday will remain on the 787 Dreamliner saga, which has seen Boeing's flagship 
aircraft grounded around the world and the company's share price fall amid reports of fires involving its innovative 
lithium-ion batteries.
Consensus forecasts are calling for earnings of $1.19 per share on $22.4bn in revenues for the quarter ended in 
December.
Yearly revenues could top Boeing's earlier guidance of $80.5bn to $82bn after the company reported that it had 
delivered 601 passenger jets, beating rival Airbus for the first time in a decade.
But the conference call Q&A is likely to be dominated by the 787 - not least the question of when it will be allowed 
to fly again, and whether the grounding will thwart plans to double production to 10 a month this year.
Boeing is unlikely to be forthcoming with answers as its hands are likely to be tied by investigations by Japanese 
and US authorities.

-Diageo shares have been on a roll and investors will be looking to the world's biggest distiller to deliver on the 
expected 5.2 per cent organic net sales growth when it reports interims - itself a deceleration from the previous 
year's 7 per cent, writes Louise Lucas.
Analysts are looking for the maker of Smirnoff vodka and Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky to lift organic operating 
profit by 8.6 per cent, pre-exceptionals, to £2bn.
Like other  purveyors of consumer goods, and in keeping with its own recent performance, Diageo is likely to 
present a polarised world: with wilting thirsts in western Europe and more buoyant growth in emerging markets.
The latter now account for some 40 per cent of group sales and are targeted to reach half. Investors will also look 
for clues on the US, where some analysts warn of a weaker performance from beers along with "solid" spirits sales. 
The consensus earnings per share is for 60.3p, up from 55.9p at the halfway stage a year ago.

Mannheimer Swartling, a Swedish law firm, will present its results to the board of the Stockholm-based telecoms 
operator on Thursday night and to the public this morning.
Telia asked the lawyers to review the circumstances surrounding its purchase of telecoms licences in the central 
Asian country after claims that Takilant, the company Telia had paid the money to, was controlled by a friend of the 
daughter of Uzbekistan's president.
Swedish courts have ordered one of the biggest asset freezes in domestic history on Takilant. That in turn has 
increased pressure on Telia, whose chief executive has pledged to resign if corruption is proved, and the Swedish 
government, the company's biggest shareholder.

Capacity cuts over the slow winter season by rival short-haul airlines and a jump in the number of business 
travellers have buoyed first-quarter revenues at easyJet.
Europe's second-largest low-cost carrier by revenues behind Ryanair on Thursday reported turnover in the final 
three months of last year up 9.2 per cent year-on-year to £833m, boosted by a 6.2 per cent increase in passenger 
numbers to 13.7m.
The Luton-based airline said that starting more flights to Italy, Switzerland and France during the final three months 
of the year - traditionally a slow period for airlines - would help the carrier narrow its expected interim loss.
"EasyJet has made a strong start to the year due to a combination of management action, competitor capacity 
reductions and the benign operating environment," said Carolyn McCall, chief executive.
In an effort to coax business travellers away from full-service airlines such as Lufthansa and British Airways, 
easyJet has introduced flexible tickets and allocated seating.
Last year, easyJet carried some 10m business passengers - up from 9m the previous year - out of a total of roughly 
60m.
EasyJet said that it about 80 per cent of its seats for the first half to March 31 were already booked, leading the 
carrier to forecast an interim loss of £50m-£75m, which compares with a loss of £112m the previous year.
EasyJet buoyed as rivals reduce capacity
Airlines traditionally report a loss over the cooler months, relying on the peak summer travel period to offset winter 
capacity cuts and lower passenger numbers.
The carrier's load factor - a key industry measure of how well easyJet fills its aircraft - rose 1 percentage point to 
88.6 per cent for the quarter.
Average revenue per passenger - which excludes air passenger duty - rose 2.8 per cent year on year to £60.80 for 
the quarter, helping offset an 0.5 per cent increase in costs per seat, excluding fuel.
The airline also refused to take a backward step in its public spat with Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, confirming that 
continued to evaluate the case for placing an order for new aircraft boasting more fuel-efficient engines, and is 
considering short-haul models by Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier.
"It is clear that there is a substantial operating cost advantage from the next generation engine technology," said 
easyJet, adding that it was evaluating commercial offers from Airbus and Boeing.
Last week, Sir Stelios reignited his public feud with the low-cost carrier that he founded by selling off part of his 
stake in protest over easyJet's fleet expansion plans.
The possible fleet expansion move has long been opposed by Sir Stelios, whose family owns a 36 per cent stake in 
the carrier and who has agitated for increased dividends for shareholders and tighter controls over easyJet's 
executive remuneration policy.
"The key takeaway from easyJet's statement is a clear commitment, in our view, to a major new aircraft order that 
could raise the wrath of easyJet's major shareholder," said James Hollins, analyst at Investec.
EasyJet shares rose 3.7 per cent to 886.5p in early London trading.

Flybe Group, the loss-making regional airline, will axe 10 per cent of its UK-based staff in an attempt to return to 
profit.
The Exeter-based carrier on Wednesday said it would make 300 people redundant - including one-fifth of its UK-
based management - and outsource support services such as on-board catering and aircraft maintenance.
The restructuring is expected to cost £10m-£12m, and is aimed at returning Flybe's UK division to a breakeven 
position by 2014 and a total of £35m of savings by 2015.
"I am extremely disappointed that many valued and hard-working colleagues may have to leave the organisation. 
It's a decision that we have tried to avoid and it is the first time in almost 30 years of business that we have had to 
take such action," said Jim French, Flybe's chairman and chief executive.
"However, recognising that any significant change to the UK economy or a rebalancing of air passenger duty paid 
by regional and domestic passengers are likely to be some way off, today's announcement represents a clear and 
realistic plan to return Flybe to profitability."
Andrew Knuckey, chief financial officer, said the restructuring would be funded through the airline's higher cashflow 
from its peak spring and summer earnings.
Analysts expect Flybe to report a pre-tax loss of £17m for the 12 months to March 31, excluding the £10m-£12m 
restructuring charge. In the previous year, the group reported a pre-tax loss of £6.4m.
Flybe to cut 300 jobs
"Although restructuring plans are all too common in the airline industry, we are relatively encouraged by two key 
elements," said Gerald Khoo, analyst at Espirito Santo, identifying Flybe's provision for extra costs and the lack of 
protracted negotiations with unions.
With three-quarters of Flybe's flights operating between domestic routes, the regional carrier suffers from a lack of 
visibility on earnings compared with internationally-focused airlines. The bulk of its tickets are sold just 10 to 15 
days ahead of travel.
While competitors Ryanair and easyJet's routes operate out of the south-east of England, Flybe specialises in 
flights from regional airports, which have been affected by stagnation in local economies during the UK's double-dip 
recession.
The regional carrier's UK division loses about £1.30 for every seat flown, and its load factor - an industry measure 
of how well Flybe fills its aircraft - sits around 60, below the 85-plus recorded by Ryanair and easyJet.
News of the restructuring came as Flybe reported a 17 per cent year-on-year increase in revenues to £193.9m in 
the final three months of 2012, driven predominantly by Flybe Finland, the carrier's joint venture with Finnair. Seats 
flown rose 13.5 per cent to 3.9m.
Flybe shares, which floated in late 2010 at 295p, fell 1 per cent to 49p in early Wednesday trading.

Ryanair is offering to sell around 40 per cent of Aer Lingus' short haul operations to Flybe, a UK-based regional 
airline, in a last-ditch attempt to prevent its takeover bid for the Irish flag carrier being blocked by the European 
Commission.
Under a new package of concessions intended to address competition concerns, Flybe would acquire Aer Lingus 
operations on 23 routes where the Ryanair merger would create a monopoly.
In addition to the Flybe offer, Ryanair would give British Airways, part of International Airlines Group, the right to buy 
approximately half of Aer Lingus's lucrative Heathrow slots, which are used to provide services to Dublin, Shannon 
and Cork.
"We've submitted a very radical package of remedies," said Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary on Tuesday, in 
an interview with Bloomberg that did not include details of the package.
However, Ryanair faces a struggle to secure European regulatory approval for its third takeover bid for Aer Lingus, 
with a ruling expected in early March.
The European Commission has objected to Ryanair's bid on competition grounds, arguing it creates a monopoly on 
around 46 routes, and antitrust problems on a further 20. It prohibited Ryanair's first bid for Aer Lingus in 2006 - and 
Brussels regulators have never cleared a merger that they previously rejected.
Ryanair makes concessions on Aer Lingus
Ryanair's sweetened offer comes after Brussels rejected its first two attempts to address competition concerns. 
Under a package submitted in December, Ryanair offered Flybe the right operate flights for three years on 20 
routes where Ryanair and Aer Lingus currently both have services.
It also gave British Airways up to 20 pairs of slots for daily flights that are held by the Irish flag carrier at the airport.
But the latest, updated package involves a more traditional divestment to Flybe - a deal that is generally preferred 
by Commission.
To make it possible for Flybe to take the Aer Lingus operations on, the deal may be structured similarly to the 2007 
transaction that saw Exeter-based Flybe acquire BA's regional operations. In that deal, BA paid Flybe more than 
£130m to take the unprofitable business and 1,500 staff off its hands.
Any deal to sell parts of Aer Lingus would also need to the consent of the flag carriers' unions, as it would see a 
large chunk of the workforce transferred to Flybe.
Ryanair is still facing strong resistance to its proposed Aer Lingus takeover from the Irish government. Last month, 
before the revised remedies were put forward, Dublin said it would not support Ryanair's bid and was unwilling to 
sell of the state's 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus to the airline.

The owners of Manchester Airport have agreed to buy Stansted, London's third biggest airport, for £1.5bn.
The deal comes after a decision by Heathrow Airport Holdings, formerly known asBAA, last year to sell the airport 
following a Competition Commission order.
The sale will leave the company that once owned London's three biggest airports with just Heathrow and a handful 
of regional facilities, including Glasgow. The operator, whose largest shareholder is Ferrovial, the Spanish 
infrastructure group, had hoped to cling on to the capital's third-biggest airport by passenger numbers and had 
mounted numerous legal challenges to a forced sale. BAA's other airports are Glasgow, Southampton and 
Aberdeen.
Stansted had been expected to sell for a discount to the £1.3bn that the UK's aviation regulator estimates its assets 
are worth. The sale price is 15.6 times 2012 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
In a statement, Manchester Airports Group said this "compares favourably with similar airport transactions in the UK 
and reflects Stansted's significant growth potential".
The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of February.
Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, MAG's current majority shareholder said: "MAG is a key 
driver of jobs and growth in the north of England and the acquisition of Stansted will help us deliver maximum value 
for Manchester City Council and the other local authority shareholders."
Manchester Airport wins Stansted auction
Boris Johnson, London's mayor, a strong opponent of ne runways at Heathrow's, has indicated support for 
expansion at Stansted as a possible new UK hub airport.
Deutsche Bank and ING are advising Stansted's owners on the sale. The sale of Stansted by BAA follows a sale 
earlier this year of Edinburgh Airport to the owner of Gatwick for £807.2m in an all-cash deal that valued it at almost 
17 times 2011 earnings.
MAG is working with Australia's Industry Funds Management in the deal to buy Stansted and had been considered 
a leading contender. It beat competition for the airport from several bidders including Australian infrastructure fund 
Macquarie and a consortium led by New Zealand investor Morrison & Co, which dropped out earlier in the process.
MAG owns Manchester, East Midlands and Bournemouth airports. Under the terms of their partnership deal, 
Industry Funds Management will buy 35.5 per cent of MAG's equity and get half its voting rights if the pair win 
Stansted.
MAG chief executive Charlie Cornish pledged to return Stansted's traffic to 2007 levels within a decade if he won 
the auction. His plans for the airport included an improvement of its retail offering and better relationships with 
airline customers, including Ryanair, the dominant carrier.
He also played down the prospect of the sort of big capital investments, such as a new train line into London, that 
would attract resistance from airlines, whose landing fees pay for such projects.
"We will use [our] expertise at Stansted to ensure that the airport can fulfil its potential as a high-quality alternative 
London access point for global air travellers. Stansted has scope to benefit from significant volume growth over the 
short, medium and long term," he said.

The owners of Manchester Airport have agreed to buy Stansted, the UK's fourth biggest airport by passenger 
numbers, for £1.5bn.
The purchase by Manchester Airports Group follows a decision last year by Heathrow Airport Holdings, formerly 
known as BAA, to no longer resist an order by competition regulators to sell Stansted.
It means that London's three largest airports - Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted - will all have different owners. 
Previously they were held by BAA, but the Competition Commission insisted on a break-up.
The three airports are expected to propose potentially contentious solutions to the capacity crunch in south-east 
England, as the government considers the vexed issue of where to build new runways.
Heathrow, the hub which is already operating at full capacity, is interested in increasing its runways from two to 
four.
But Gatwick has suggested that it and Stansted should each add a runway. It would mean that London could have 
three airports, each with two runways, competing for business.
Boris Johnson, London's mayor and a strong opponent of new runways at Heathrow, has indicated support for 
expansion at Stansted as a possible new hub airport.
The sale of Stansted will leave Heathrow Airport Holdings with just Heathrow and a handful of smaller airports, 
including Glasgow.

The owners of Stansted, London's third-biggest airport, on Wednesday received three final bids for the hub, in a 
sale that is likely to value it at about £1bn.
Final bidders included Manchester Airports Group, partnered with Australia's Industry Funds Management; 
infrastructure fund Macquarie, and Malaysia Airports, according to people familiar with the situation.
A decision on the sale was expected as early as this week, two of the people added, after its owner Heathrow 
airport Holdings, formerly known as BAA, finally agreed last summer to sell the airport following a 2009 Competition 
Commission order.
The MAG consortium has been seen as a leading contender. MAG owns Manchester, East Midlands and 
Bournemouth airports. Under the terms of their partnership deal, Industry Funds Management will buy 35 per cent 
of MAG's equity and get half its voting rights if the pair win Stansted.
MAG might be better positioned than others to negotiate with Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, given its 
extensive dealings with the low-cost airline at its airports. Ryanair represents two-thirds of Stansted's customers.
Regulated airports such as Stansted, which analysts say could fetch about £1bn, are a rare prize and appeal to 
investors looking for safe, inflation-pegged returns.
Deutsche Bank and ING are advising Stansted's owners on the sale. Both declined to comment. MAG, Macquarie 
and Heathrow airport Holdings also declined to comment. Malaysian Airports was not immediately available for 
comment.

Manchester Airports Group hopes to boost transatlantic routes over the next year as it seeks to build on recent 
traffic growth provided by low-cost and Middle Eastern carriers.
Neil Thompson, chief financial officer of MAG - which owns East Midlands and Bournemouth airports alongside 
Manchester, the UK's third-biggest by passenger numbers - on Wednesday said that the company's 2 per cent rise 
in passenger traffic in the six months to October was driven by budget and Gulf carriers.
But he added: "There is absolutely opportunity in the transatlantic market for us, and we'll be working hard with the 
US carriers to broaden out in America next year."
MAG is also talking to Asian carriers about new routes. "We think they are slightly longer-burn opportunities," Mr 
Thompson said.
Sales at MAG rose at a steeper rate than passenger numbers in the half-year, pushed up by car-parking revenues 
and new retail offerings.
The airport group, which is owned by 10 local councils, reported underlying operating profits of £63m on interim 
sales of £230m.
Take-off and landing charges were held "broadly steady", although the company offered deals to airlines willing to 
make use of non-peak time slots or commit to year-round rather than summer-only routes.
Manchester Airports eyes US market
MAG predicted it would continue to outperform the UK airport market in spite of a bearish view of the economy in 
2013. "We've grown in the past 18 months with no help from [gross domestic product]," said Mr Thompson. "Do we 
think we'll get much help in the next 12 months? We're not banking on it."
While he pointed out that the southeast of England was likely to lead any recovery, he declined to comment on the 
auction of Stansted airport, for which MAG is considered the leading bidder.
Its chances were boosted on Tuesday when it emerged that a rival consortium led by New Zealand investor 
Morrison & Co had pulled out.
With final bids due mid-month, Heathrow airport Holdings, Stansted's owner, is now facing the prospect of moving 
forward with just two bidders. Macquarie, the infrastructure fund, plans to put in a final offer though it has not said 
how it would finance the bid. MAG said the funding for its bid, in partnership with Australia's Industry Funds 
Management, was "very well organised and prepared".
A group of Malaysian investors has also reportedly expressed interest in Stansted. One person close to the auction 
said some investors had been scared off by Stansted's dependence on Ryanair, whose customers represent two-
thirds of all the airport's traffic.
MAG might be better positioned than others to negotiate with Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, given its 
extensive dealings with the airline at its airports.

Corporate indigestion is as unpleasant as too many mince pies on Christmas day. So Monday's denial by Air 
France-KLM of talks to buy more shares in Italy's Alitalia - where it has held a 25 per cent stake since 2009 - should 
be welcomed. The Franco-Dutch carrier has plenty on its plate already as it tries to stabilise finances and cut unit 
costs and fleet. Admittedly, there could be additional synergies from a tighter tie-up with the Italian airline medium-
term. But now is not the moment to take on more politically sensitive downsizing in another recession-hit country.
True, investors might be tempted to look at Air France-KLM's share price and assume that all is already hunky-dory. 
The stock has more than doubled from about EUR3 in June when overhaul plans were delineated and 
outperformed the European airline industry by 50 per cent over the past year. But on an enterprise value to 2013 
earnings basis, Air France-KLM now trades at a premium to the sector. That looks premature, leaving no room for 
error in a restructuring designed to return the lossmaking carrier to a 6-8 per cent operating margin - only in line 
with peers - by 2015. Net debt fell from EUR6.5bn at end-2011 to EUR6bn by September, but needs to come down 
to EUR4.5bn by end-2014. More than 1,000 full-time equivalent jobs have been shed at Air France, from 2011's 
72,000. The 2014 target, though, is under 66,000.
Moreover, while Europe's low-cost carriers have remained disciplined in terms of capacity, they are not about to 
give bigger rivals an easy ride. KLM's strategy include expansion in Scandinavia, where LCCs, including Ryanair, 
pose strong competition. On Monday, easyJet, which has been expanding regional bases in France, posted 6.7 per 
cent passenger growth for 2012: Ryanair, 4 per cent. (Load factors were stable or higher). Full-cost rivals, with 
much work to do, may struggle to land smoothly.

Redheads of the world, unite! Promising a "festival of ginger-loving madness", the Redhead Convention in the 
village of Crosshaven on Ireland's southeast coast is one of hundreds of events next year bidding to lure home the 
country's 100m strong diaspora.
"Ireland has one of the highest populations of redheads in the world and we will celebrate by getting as many 
together as possible," says Alan Hayes, crowned king of the redheads this year. Competitions will include best red 
eyebrows, longest red hair, a carrot tossing championship and the popular "most freckles per square inch".
For centuries Irish men and women have fled poverty, unemployment and famine to make new lives abroad. Now, 
as the country faces its most recent economic crisis, Dublin is asking its diaspora to help with its recovery.
On New Years Eve one of the biggest tourist initiatives in Irish history will begin with a huge fireworks display in 
Dublin, marking a year-long invitation to people with Irish connections to visit the country.
"Our target is to attract an extra 325,000 overseas visitors," says Jim Miley, the project's director. "There are also 
corporate events aimed at pushing out the message that Ireland Inc is a good place to invest."
The initiative, branded The Gathering, is attempting to reverse a sharp decline in overseas visitors travelling to 
Ireland since its economic crisis struck in 2008.
In the past the Irish diaspora has played an important role in charitable fundraising, encouraging inward investment 
and even providing political clout to Dublin for the Northern Ireland peace process. The Gathering marks Ireland's 
Irish hopes to raise cash by seeing red
most explicit attempt yet to boost "genealogy tourism", where tourists can trace ancestral roots in their country of 
origin.
The Gathering includes more than 2,500 events, including some established Irish festivals such as St Patrick's Day. 
But many of the events will be local get-togethers and reunions of sports clubs or schools, and there is a range of 
slightly wackier events such as the redhead convention and the Left Hand festival in Mullingar, both in August. In 
County Sligo, people will climb Benbulben Mountain to take part in a choreographed "message of hope" inspired by 
the poetry of W. B. Yeats.
Dublin is actively targeting tourism as a key sector to create jobs and tackle an unemployment rate of just under 15 
per cent. Last year it cut VAT on tourism and it has introduced a visa waiver scheme to make it easier for non-
European tourists to enter the country.
But at a time when 87,000 people are emigrating from Ireland every year to escape the economic crisis, The 
Gathering is also stoking controversy from critics who accuse Dublin of neglecting its emigrants.
Outspoken Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary recently labelled The Gathering as "the grabbing". Irish actor Gabriel 
Byrne, who previously served as a cultural ambassador for Ireland, said the project was a "scam".
"Most people don't give a shit about the diaspora except to shake them down for a few quid," Mr Byrne told Irish 
radio.
Dublin, which is spending EUR5m promoting The Gathering, is confident, nonetheless. It cites its recent success in 
hosting the opening match of the US college football season this year between Notre Dame and the US Naval 
Academy. About 35,000 fans travelled from the US to see the match.
"About a third of the extra visitors will come from North America and it is very encouraging that we have already 
negotiated 16 to 20 per cent increase in airline capacity on US routes," says Mr Miley.
Rejecting criticism of the event, Dublin says it is reaching out to Irish emigrants by funding Irish centres and Gaelic 
sports clubs abroad.
Leo Varadkar, Ireland's tourism minister, retorts: "I thought it was a bit rich of Ryanair, which is extremely profitable. 
I'm sure they don't make profits of EUR500m a year out of generosity to tourists."
&lt;
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
The Gathering is modelled on similar schemes in Scotland and Israel that seek to tap into their diaspora to boost 
tourism, investment and establish links with emigrants, writes Jamie Smyth.
"Reaching out to diasporas has become a real phenomenon over the past 10 years, particularly in the developing 
world where governments have seen the huge magnitude of remittances and want to tap into them," says Kathleen 
Newland, director of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington.
India and Israel have both successfully raised billions of dollars through "diaspora bonds" - bonds marketed directly 
to emigrants in rich countries. Last year crisis-struck Greece announced plans to issue a similar type of bond to tap 
into its emigrants' feelings of patriotism.
"Tourism is a big focus for several countries. Vietnam recently had a Visit Vietnam campaign targeting its diaspora. 
In the developed world Ireland and Scotland have been real pioneers in tapping into genealogical and heritage 
tourism," Ms Newland says.
Irish hopes to raise cash by seeing red
In 2009 Scotland's "Homecoming" celebration pitched around the 250th anniversary of the poet Robert Burns 
attracted 72,000 overseas visitors, generating £53.7m for the local economy. The relative success of the tourism 
project has prompted the Scottish executive to plan another Homecoming event in 2014.

The fees Stansted Airport charges airlines are unlikely to escape regulation over the next decade after the Civil 
Aviation Authority determined that the airport already wields market power and predicted its competitive advantage 
will grow.
The CAA said on Thursday that it was "minded to" continue regulation of London's third-biggest airport by 
passenger numbers.
This follows a consultation that suggested Stansted was charging above market rates, and demonstrated that its 
biggest customers - Ryanair and easyJet - were constrained in their ability to move to rival facilities.
A final decision will not be made for another four months. But the regulator decided an early steer was prudent, 
given the planned sale of Stansted early next year. At least four bidders are circling the asset, including the owner 
of Manchester Airport, and a plan to deregulate would have boosted the asking price, which analysts put at about 
£1bn.
Still, it is unclear whether a new owner will continue to charge the upper limit allowed by the CAA, since high fees 
have contributed to a steep fall in passenger volumes over the past five years - from a 2007 peak of 24m to 18m 
this year.
"The ongoing uncertainty is a headache for bidders because it increases the number of possible future scenarios," 
said Douglas McNeill, an aviation analyst with Charles Stanley.
Watchdog doubtful on Stansted deregulation
A CAA spokesman said on Thursday that high levels of uncertainty - due not only to the sale but also to the 
government's position on airport expansion in southeast England - meant the traditional five-year regulatory control 
period might be inappropriate.
"The new licence regime will allow us more flexibility," said the spokesman. "For instance, control periods could 
potentially be longer or shorter. When the energy supply market was first opening up, in 1998-2001, two to three 
years was found to be appropriate."
He added that the CAA was open to new approaches to airport regulation, whether that meant changes to the way 
it determined price caps or abandoning caps altogether in favour of a lighter-touch "back stop" system that 
monitored fees for fairness.
Ryanair and easyJet welcomed the CAA's guidance, while Stansted said it would "be taking time to study their 
evidence and arguments before responding to the consultation".
The regulator said it expected that constrained airport capacity across London would increase Stansted's market 
power in the years to 2020, since low-cost carriers, in particular, would find it difficult to move operations to rival 
airports such as Gatwick and Luton.

Wizz Airlines, the eastern European budget airline, is aiming to more than double its traffic by 2020, to 25m 
passengers a year, as it steals market share from legacy carriers and uses low fares to bring new customers to air 
travel.
József Váradi, Wizz's founder and chief executive, said in an interview that he expected passenger volumes to 
grow by about 10 per cent a year over the next decade - in line with the airline's performance last year and at a 
higher rate than those of more established rivals such as Ryanair and easyJet.
"The ability of the industry to stimulate new traffic has become constrained but the low-cost sector can still grow at 
the expense of the established traditional carriers," he said. "I think the kind of growth we are achieving today, even 
under tough conditions, can be delivered."
Wizz flew 12m passengers in the past 12 months, putting it among the top five European budget carriers by 
passenger numbers and helping it turn a profit of EUR43m in the year to March 31, on sales of EUR766m. But 
analysts point out it has benefited from a benign competitive environment recently, with European airlines 
maintaining strict capacity discipline and pushing up prices.
A doubling of annual passengers "seems ambitious in the context of Ryanair and easyJet doing two massive new 
orders soon", said one aviation analyst who asked not to be named, referring to the two budget airlines' talks with 
aircraft manufacturers about possible fleet expansion. "Ryanair's aiming for 130m passengers over the next decade 
[from 76m last year]; it's going to need to take a lot of short-haul European market share to do that," he added.
Wizz aims to double its traffic by 2020
But Hungary-based Wizz is prepared for that onslaught, insisted Mr Váradi: "We designed our business model to 
remain effective no matter what and no matter who we have to compete with."
Moreover, while Ryanair has added a number of eastern European bases in recent months, its growth strategy and 
that of easyJet is centred on markets further west, leaving Wizz as the main beneficiary in the short term of the 
struggles of eastern European legacy carriers.
Mr Váradi admitted his growth ambitions would probably necessitate a public offering of privately held Wizz - though 
he added that the airline's current backers, dominated by German transport-focused bank DNV, were happy to wait 
for better market conditions.

Dublin said it cannot support Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus due to concerns that it would undermine Ireland's 
competitiveness and reduce the number of flights in and out of the country.
In a significant blow to Ryanair's ambition to take over its Irish rival, Leo Varadkar, Ireland's transport minister, said 
on Tuesday he could not support the bid or the sale of the government's 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus to the 
airline.
"Based on what is now in the public domain the Ryanair remedies package does not satisfy our concerns about 
connectivity, competitiveness or employment for Ireland," he said following a meeting of the Irish cabinet.
"Obviously the European Commission will make their own decision in their own time on this matter but we do not 
see any benefit to Ireland on what has been reported and will not be supporting it," said Mr Varadkar.
In a statement Ryanair said Dublin had no power to block its offer.
"Since the Government owns just 25 per cent of Aer Lingus it has no power to block Ryanair's offer, which can still 
be successfully completed if we acquire a shareholding of 50 per cent or more," it said.
Ryanair currently owns almost 30 per cent of shares in Aer Lingus.
Up until this week, Dublin has remained neutral on Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus. But concerns over the possible loss 
of control over Aer Lingus's valuable landing slots at London's Heathrow airport played a role in persuading the 
Ireland attacks Ryanair 's Aer Lingus bid
government to publicly attack the bid. Dublin is also concerned that Ryanair's remedies package is only guaranteed 
to stay in place for a three-year period.
"What is there really only allows for up to three years of ongoing competition and competitiveness and that is not 
secure enough for us," said Mr Varadkar.
The Irish government has sent its objections to Brussels in the past few days.
Ryanair is trying to secure regulatory approval for its third takeover bid for the Irish flag carrier.
Last month, the European Commission objected to Ryanair's bid on competition grounds. The commission 
prohibited Ryanair's first bid for Aer Lingus in 2007, and Brussels has never cleared a merger that it previously 
rejected.
Ryanair is working on a comprehensive remedies package designed to persuade Brussels that its takeover will not 
damage competition.
On Saturday, the Financial Times reported that British Airways had struck a deal with Ryanair to purchase more 
than 85 per cent of Aer Lingus's slots at Heathrow airport, which are currently used to provide services to Dublin, 
Shannon and Cork. This would enable BA to expand its long haul operations if Ryanair was able to take over Aer 
Lingus.
Mr Varadkar said the Irish government remained committed to selling its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus but only at 
the right time and under the right conditions.

Body
Things were not supposed to go wrong quite so quickly. In 2004, three months after laun­ching an airline catering to 
eastern Europeans and employing the low-cost model made famous by Southwest Airlines and Ryanair, József 
Váradi had to ask his management team to work for free. It was that or go under.
Mr Váradi, a Hungarian economist who had climbed the corporate ladder at Procter & Gamble and then spent 18 
months as chief executive of Malev, Hungary's now defunct state-owned airline, had taken delivery of six leased 
aircraft for his company, Wizz Air. He was confident he could fill them: the potential customers were there and the 
proposition was right.
But he had been more relaxed about the progress of signing up passengers when he thought finalisation of funding 
arrangements with institutional in­vestors was imminent. In fact, securing the hundreds of millions of euros needed 
was taking longer than expected, and in the meantime cash was leaching out of the young business in the form of 
fuel payments, airport charges and salaries. As suppliers started talking about bills not being paid, the press 
pounced. "It was very distressing," he says. "There were articles suggesting people shouldn't book because we 
were on the brink of going bust, and I had to tell [staff] it was very uncert­ain their salaries would ever be paid."
Most of the management team agreed to delay taking their pay, and the institutional money eventually landed. Mr 
Váradi says he learnt a lesson: "You understand it's not enough to manage a business just for profit - you also have 
to manage it for cash."
That was just one of the first bumps in the road. Wizz's passenger numbers have grown strongly since launch - 
although the rise of about 10 per cent in 2012 to EUR12m was a little less than in previous years. In 2010 the 
A bumpy ride piloting a start-up airline
company broke even, thanks to a change in the way it accounted for maintenance costs. It swung to a loss again 
last year, but produced pre-tax profits of about EUR43m in the year to March 31, on sales of EUR766m.
Wizz has expanded its fleet to nearly 40, and aims to reach 50 by 2014. In common with many other airline start-
ups, the company's aircraft are all run on operating leases rather than owned outright. But the plan is to find a better 
balance bet­ween leased and owned jets, Mr Váradi says, in line with Europe's two leading low-cost short-haul 
carriers, easyJet and Ryanair.
He has learnt from his bigger rivals in other ways, too. However, he says his hands-on lessons came from Malev - 
which shut in February, long after Mr Váradi had left the company and was "a good school in how not to do 
business" - and JetBlue in the US, which he visited ahead of launching Wizz.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, some of his former colleagues resent his disparagement of Malev, saying he himself could 
have done more to fix the airline. One, who asked not to be named, even says he believes Mr Váradi struck aircraft 
deals in his waning days at Malev that made little sense for the flag-carrier, but would later help Wizz through the 
relationships they burnished. Mr Váradi rej­ects the notion completely, pointing out that the deals in question were 
with a different leasing company than that used by Wizz.
&lt;
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
&gt; Sipping coffee in a hotel bar in London's Mayfair, he seems unassuming and diffident compared with other 
captains of industry.  However, he has had to develop a thick skin in a sector with more than its share of outspoken 
executives, such as Ryanair's Michael O'Leary. He found himself at the rec­eiving end of Mr O'Leary's invective this 
year, when Wizz and Ryanair both ratcheted up their operations in and out of Budapest in the wake of Malev's 
collapse.
"I've spent my entire career in the corporate world and I think I'm used to it," says Mr Váradi of this sort of attack. "I 
can differentiate between how people are and how they behave when they act on behalf of their company and 
therefore play a role."
It was a desire to be tested that first prompted his move into aviation and then to launch a business of his own. He 
says a change of political regime in Hungary also meant his position at Malev was no longer tenable.
Until recently, there was little reason for Ryanair to want to disparage Wizz. As recently as 2009, the two airlines' 
routes overlapped so little that some analysts have regularly asked wheth­er Wizz was positioning itself as a 
takeover target.
Mr Váradi rejects the idea but ad­mits the two operations would mesh in areas other than network. Like Ryanair, 
Wizz flies mostly from secondary airports, has a non-unionised workforce and eschews the not­ion of chasing 
business travellers. On luggage policies, Mr Váradi ap­pears even to have outdone Mr O'Leary: Wizz Air 
passengers pay EUR10 for carry-on bags that Ryanair would fly for free; the only free luggage Wizz Air allows must 
fit under the seat.
"We try to deliver this business at the lowest possible cost," says Mr Váradi.
Industry insiders who have sat op­posite Mr Váradi in negotiations, but who decline to be named, say he is just as 
willing as Mr O'Leary to walk away from, say, an airport if it does not offer him the deal he wants. Yet his style is 
considerably less brash, even solicitous - a quality he wants reflected in frontline employees. "A customer is not a 
pain to us. We think the customer is someone that we profit from, so that person deserves some care," he says.
He hopes that approach will help Wizz continue to grow in its existing markets, where he still sees opportunities - 
particularly if and when governments stop propping up ailing state carriers - as well as to expand geographically. 
A bumpy ride piloting a start-up airline
Wizz recently launch­ed a route to Kutaisi, Georgia's second-biggest city and now the easternmost point in the 
airline's network.
While he says there are no specific long-term passenger targets, Mr Vár­adi sees Wizz carrying 25m or more 
people a year by 2020 - and admits that by then, it is much more likely than not to be a publicly listed airline. For 
now, though, he says his investors - including Frankfurt-based DVB Bank, Indigo Partners in the US, and wealthy 
individuals - are being patient as they wait for better market conditions.
If the challenges of rivals' invective, government-backing for state-owned airlines or disappointments in new 
markets ever seem too much he re­members that, as an employee, he had craved the heat and light that 
entre­preurship might bring. "At Procter & Gamble, you're always just a part of a mach­ine," he says. He remembers 
realising that "if you have a bit of an ambition to test yourself, you need to get into a different environment".

Poland's Lot airline was supposed to be ending the year with a 52m zlotys ($16.8m) net profit.
Instead, the state-owned carrier has had to rush to the Treasury ministry for a handout just to keep its aircraft flying 
through Christmas.
The aid request at the beginning of last week stunned the government, which owns 68 per cent of the airline, and a 
furious Mikolaj Budzanowski, treasury minister, called for the head of chief executive Marcin Pirog, blaming him for 
the debacle.
Mr Pirog, who had served just over two years - longer than the average for Lot chief executives in recent years - 
was removed by the board.
But a simple change at the top is unlikely to save Lot.
The airline has asked for 1bn zlotys in aid, and the full amount of help could come to 1.5bn zlotys.
"This is an unbelievable sum," says an aviation expert. "The airline only has revenues of about 3bn zlotys."
He says that without an immediate cash infusion, Lot will fail to pay its bills for fuel, airport fees and salaries.
"People knew it was bad, but no one had any idea things were this bad."
Mr Pirog told a parliamentary committee this year that the airline - which lost 145m zlotys in 2011 - was on course 
to turn a profit.
Lot of aid keeps Polish airline aloft
All seemed well in November, when Lot staged a celebration as it became the first European airline to take delivery 
of Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner.
Lot has put some of the blame for its troubles on a fall in business-class sales because the financial crisis is 
prompting many people to fly economy instead.
But the airline faces deeper structural problems, something with which many other small flag carriers are struggling.
Malév, Hungary's national airline, stopped flying this summer, while Czech Airlines received approval for a 
EUR100m restructuring programme from Brussels and is being touted to Korean Air and Kuwait Airways.
Lot is still trying to be a full-service airline, offering long-haul flights to destinations such as Toronto, Chicago and 
Beijing while flying shorter national and European routes.
"In this day and age, not every airline can do everything without subsidies," says Aleksander Domaradzki, 
managing partner of DGL Polska, a consultancy.
Lot faces competition at the bottom end from carriers such as Ryanair and Hungary's Wizz Air, while airlines such 
as Lufthansa siphon off higher-end Polish travellers.
The most viable solution would be to sell Lot, but a law reserving 51 per cent of the shareholding votes for the 
government makes it an unattractive partner for a potential European buyer.
The Polish government has held out hopes that Turkish Airlines or Air China might rescue the airline, but European 
Union rules barring non-member-state carriers from taking more than a 50 per cent stake in any EU airline make 
that sort of transaction unlikely.
"It seems the normal course of events is for an airline to be brought to the brink of bankruptcy before politicians 
react," says the aviation expert.
"The same happened with Belgium's Sabena, Alitalia and Austrian."

British Airways stands to strengthen its grip on Heathrow by gaining the right to buy a large chunk of take-off and 
landing slots at the airport, as part of proposals Ryanair is offering European regulators to seek approval for its 
contentious takeover of Aer Lingus.
The UK flag carrier, the largest airline at Heathrow, has struck a deal with Ryanair to purchase more than 85 per 
cent of Aer Lingus's slots at the airport, which are currently used to provide services to Dublin, Shannon and Cork, 
said three people familiar with the agreement between Ryanair and British Airways.
Heathrow is running at near full capacity, so the opportunity to buy Aer Lingus's slots at the airport could provide 
British Airways with an important means to eventually expand its long-haul services.
Ryanair is trying to secure regulatory approval for its third takeover bid for the Irish flag carrier.
Last month, the European Commission objected to Ryanair's bid on competition grounds. The commission 
prohibited Ryanair's first bid for Aer Lingus in 2007, and Brussels has never cleared a merger that it previously 
rejected.
British Airways is offering to take responsibility for many of Aer Lingus's services out of Heathrow for at least three 
years.
With British Airways operating these services, Ryanair is privately saying that a combined Ryanair-Aer Lingus 
would not be dominant on those routes, said people familiar with the Irish budget carrier's stance.
BA in Ryanair deal for Heathrow slots
However, British Airways would run these services in place of Aer Lingus for between three and five years - after 
that it would have the right to buy the Irish flag carrier's Heathrow slots and reallocate them to different destinations, 
such as New York.
Aer Lingus is the third-largest airline at Heathrow, and British Airways would be able to purchase up to 20 pairs of 
slots for daily flights that are held by the Irish flag carrier at the airport.
In the same regulatory process, Flybe, the smaller UK airline that has issued four profit warnings since its 2010 
flotation, has offered to operate flights for three years on 20 routes where Ryanair and Aer Lingus currently both 
have services.
Without Flybe's offer, the combined Ryanair-Aer Lingus would be in a monopoly or dominant position on those 20 
routes.
The moves by British Airways and Flybe form the centrepiece of a remedies package that Ryanair has submitted to 
the European Commission, to try to persuade Brussels to approve the takeover bid.
International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways, said: "We have signed a non-binding [memorandum of 
understanding] with Ryanair which is subject to EC approval ... and IAG board approval."
Flybe and Ryanair declined to comment.

A UK probe into Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus has been given the go-ahead after the low-cost carrier lost an 
appeal that the inquiry undermined a separate European Commission probe of its bid for the Irish flag carrier.
The UK Competition Commission has won the right to pursue its investigation into whether Ryanair wields undue 
influence over Aer Lingus, in which it holds a 29.8 per cent stake.
Aer Lingus welcomed the decision, calling it "a key milestone on the path toward Ryanair being required to divest its 
shareholding in Aer Lingus".
However, Ryanair said on Thursday that it would ask the UK's supreme court to hear another appeal.
That move could further delay the UK Competition Commission's probe, though the regulator might also decide to 
push ahead while the supreme court considers taking on the case. Either way, the regulator would probably not 
publish its initial findings before March next year - after the European Commission is expected to rule on the 
takeover bid.
Ryanair said the UK probe contravenes the principle of "sincere co-operation" between the EU and member states. 
But that argument may be weakened by the fact that the UK Competition Commission will now report after its 
European counterpart.
The prospects of European regulators approving Ryanair's third tilt at Aer Lingus look poor. People involved in talks 
between the EU and the airline say Ryanair has been told its package of "revolutionary" remedies to competition 
concerns has fallen short.
Ryanair loses appeal over Aer Lingus probe
The most recent group to consider asking the UK supreme court to hear a competition case was BAA, the airport 
operator now known as Heathrow Holdings, which was attempting to overturn a 2009 Competition Commission 
order that it sell Stansted airport.
But it eventually decided not to challenge the court of appeal decision, and is now in the process of selling London's 
third-biggest airport by passenger numbers.
Separately, Ryanair said on Thursday that it had appointed two new directors. Julie O'Neill, former secretary-
general of Ireland's transport department, and Louise Phelan, a PayPal executive, will both join the board, while 
Klaus Kirchberger, a Ryanair director for 10 years, is stepping down.
David Bonderman, chairman, thanked Mr Kirchberger for his service, giving the German businessman credit for 
helping guide Ryanair's "rapid growth in Germany and across much of central Europe".
Ms O'Neill is also a director of Ireland's Sustainable Energy Authority. Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive, 
has called environmental activists "loonies" but has not ruled out switching to greener fuel - "the second it becomes 
cheaper than traditional aviation fuel".

Spanish trade unions have called off a planned six-day strike at Iberia during the Christmas period over plans to fire 
4,500 workers in a sweeping restructuring of the lossmaking carrier.
The unions will continue negotiations with the airline's management after failing to reach agreement in eight hours 
of discussion at an arbitration committee. Planned strikes on the December 14, and between the 17 and 21, were 
cancelled to avoid causing disruption to passengers as talks continued, Spanish state media reported.
Ground and cabin crew at Iberia, which alongside British Airways makes up International Airlines Group, were 
intending to hold round the clock strikes against a plan by Iberia to make almost a quarter of its workforce 
redundant.
That prompted Ana Pastor, the Spanish transport minister, to call for a resolution of the dispute.
Rafael Sánchez-Lozano, Iberia's chief executive, said the strike would cause serious damage to the lossmaking 
company. Iberia has reported an operating loss of EUR262m for the first nine months of 2012.
Iberia has suffered from competition from low-cost competitors such as Ryanair at the same time as recession in its 
home market has reduced demand for short-haul air travel.
Sepla, Spain's pilots union, is not allowed to strike until a separate arbitration process with Iberia over its creation of 
Iberia Express, a new low-cost short-haul carrier, is resolved.

The coming decade will see a "flattening" of competition among European airlines, according to the chief executive 
of Monarch.
The privately-held UK carrier hopes to benefit from rising costs at easyJet and Ryanair and a move to á la carte 
services, which allow passengers to tailor their travel requirements, by flag-carriers.
Monarch said last week that a two-year turnround launched last year is on course to deliver a profitable company 
next year, on the back of higher passenger numbers, constrained capacity growth and an aggressive cost-cutting 
programme.
Iain Rawlinson predicted nearly two thirds of the revenue growth he expected to see in the next 12 months would 
come from leisure-focused Monarch picking up routes dropped by competitors such as the tour operator Thomas 
Cook.
But he added that, in the longer term, he believed the playing field with the big low-cost carriers would become 
more level. "The fleet deals they got in the old days won't be repeated," he said, arguing that would mean higher 
cost bases, and a chance for Monarch to pull away customers with competitive prices and better services.
"It really is a pivotal moment. For the same price, customers will maybe get a better service."
While aviation experts agreed Ryanair and easyJet - which are both considering big aircraft orders in the next year - 
would be paying more for new aircraft than they did in past deals, they questioned the extent to which that would 
change the competitive landscape.
Monarch upbeat over European competitors
Gert Zonneveld, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, argued that an airline's depreciation costs represented just a 
fraction of total costs per seat, and would only rise slowly over time in any case. "There may be some upward 
pressure but I don't think Ryanair is going to be quaking in its boots," he said.
But RBC Capital analysts wrote in a note on Friday that easyJet, for one, appeared set to push up its top-line 
through higher prices rather than volume growth, leaving it vulnerable both to "eventual passenger push-back on 
total travel cost price and targeted competitive responses".
Monarch, which also runs a tour operator and maintenance division, is itself looking to order 45 aircraft - to both 
replace older models and expand the commercial airline's 38-jet fleet - for delivery over the next eight years. Robert 
Palmer, finance director, said the group was aiming for a single-manufacturer fleet, be it Airbus, Boeing or 
Bombardier aircraft.
Douglas McNeil at Charles Stanley praised the progress the group had made over the past year. "They've taken a 
leaf out of the easyJet handbook," he said, referring to capacity discipline and an emphasis on web marketing. 
Passenger volumes rose by nearly 16 per cent in the year to end-October. "And that only works if the business 
you've got is of comparable quality [to easyJet]."
But he also questioned the extent to which such a small airline - which is aiming to hit 10m passengers by 2015 - 
could compete with rivals more than five times as big.

Body
Italian airport operator SEA SpA has cancelled plans to list on the Milan stock exchange after weak take-up by 
investors and bickering among the main shareholders about the price.
SEA, which manages Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, had approved a price range that valued the company 
between EUR800m to EUR1.1bn, which would have made it Italy's largest initial public offering this year.
However, state-sponsored private equity fund F2i, one of SEA's main shareholders, had openly opposed the timing 
of the IPO and the valuation. The fund bought around a third of the company a year ago at an implied value of 
EUR1.3bn.
People close to the deal said the company had decided to pull its IPO - for the third time in a decade - after 
attracting investor interest for only about a third of the shares offered for sale and only at the lower end of the price 
range.
SEA would have been only the second IPO on Milan's main market this year after the April listing of luxury 
cashmere clothing maker Brunello Cucinelli.
Its failure has stoked an already intense war of words between the city of Milan, which owns 55 per cent of SEA, 
and F2i, which owns a third of the company.
Milan mayor, Giuliano Pisapia, whose office had supported the IPO, said the city council would be investigating the 
reasons for the failure of the flotation and "those responsible will pay the consequences".
SEA scraps listing plans
The failure of the IPO puts into doubt the finances of the city of Milan which had hoped to make at least EUR80m 
out of the listing.
While the number of passengers who use Milan's airports has been inching higher in the past few years, Italy's 
lingering recession has presented a challenge for SEA. SEA has struggled to build up its customer base since 
Alitalia's decision five years ago to concentrate on Rome and, although the 28m passengers who passed through 
Malpensa and Linate last year is 3.7 per cent more than in 2010, it is almost a fifth lower than in 2007.
SEA also has a 31 per cent stake in the company that manages the Bergamo airport 35 miles east of Milan.
Ryanair's decision to make Bergamo its main entryway into northern Italy has led to a surge in traffic in recent years 
and last year the airport carried almost as many passengers as Linate.
F2i had forced SEA to revise its prospectus with additional information, including data showing a decline in traffic in 
October and part of November.

British Airways is seeking compensation from Sepla, the Spanish pilots' union, claiming it suffered losses because 
of a series of strikes held in Spain.
BA is suing for damages because it claims the strikes organised by Sepla had a negative impact on joint 
businesses that the UK airline has with Iberia, the Spanish carrier.
International Airlines Group, the parent of BA and Iberia, is also involved in the legal action against Sepla, but it 
denied the move was intended to put pressure on the union to agree to a sweeping restructuring of Iberia.
Justo Peral, Sepla's main representative at Iberia, denied the union had damaged BA. He responded to the legal 
action by saying the union would not negotiate with management on the proposed Iberia restructuring, which was 
announced this month and involves cutting 4,500 jobs - 22 per cent of the workforce.
This highlights the increasingly febrile situation at Iberia - unions representing cabin crew and ground staff are 
threatening six days of strikes, starting on December 14, in protest at the restructuring plan.
Sepla is barred from joining the industrial action because of a government-commissioned arbitration process that 
brought the earlier set of strikes to an end in April.
Those strikes, which began last December and ran over 18 days, were organised after Iberia announced plans for 
Iberia Express, a budget airline.
BA sues Spanish pilots' union over strike
Iberia has been struggling against low-cost carriers led by Ryanair, and Iberia Express is supposed to provide a 
competitive alternative. Pilots at Iberia Express are paid less than those at Iberia, prompting the industrial action.
BA is seeking damages because it has a joint business with Iberia for passenger services between London and 
Madrid, and the UK carrier claims this venture was damaged by the strikes.
It also claims that the strikes damaged another joint business involving BA, Iberia and American Airlines for 
passenger services between Europe and the US.
IAG said: "IAG is seeking a declaration that its EU rights were infringed and British Airways is seeking damages 
because the strikes affected its business, causing it to incur financial loss."
IAG and BA are expected to claim that the strikes were not justified, or proportionate, because Iberia pilots did not 
have their pay and benefits changed following the establishment of Iberia Express in March.
Iberia is not pursuing a separate legal claim for compensation against Sepla.

From Mr Joe Gill.
Sir, Your article "Flag carriers struggle to find route to profits" (November 20) unmasks a key faultline in commercial 
aviation. On one side is an array of suppliers including aircraft manufacturers, lessors, airports and global 
distribution systems. All of these have a long record of generating equity value by producing returns on capital that 
exceed its cost. Yet, these providers depend entirely for their existence on a group of airlines that in aggregate have 
destroyed shareholder value for decades.
It is only by applying the cost disciplines of a Tibetan monk, particularly in short-haul markets, that airlines can 
create real value for their own shareholders instead of for suppliers.

Brussels' objections to Ryanair's third takeover bid for Aer Lingus are even more extensive than when it first 
blocked the tie-up in 2007, according to the EU competition authority's formal charge sheet.
The European Commission's "statement of objections", issued last week, argues the merged Irish carrier would 
hold a more dominant position than in 2007, with an effective stranglehold over more than 40 routes, according to 
people familiar with its contents.
These reservations indicate that Ryanair has a steeper hill to climb in Brussels than with its first bid for Aer Lingus, 
which was prohibited five years ago on the grounds that the combined group would have a monopoly on 22 routes 
and be dominant on a further 13.
The commission served its charges after rejecting what Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, described as a 
"revolutionary" remedies package to secure regulatory approval.
Ryanair said it had found airlines willing to provide services on routes that would otherwise be dominated by the 
merged Irish carrier. But Brussels made clear the proposals failed to address all the routes with competition 
problems.
Indeed, the commission found the measures so unsatisfactory it decided against asking rival airlines to comment on 
the details - the usual step in assessing concessions. Ryanair is confident the commission will "market test" its 
proposals shortly.
Brussels steps up challenge to Ryanair
Significantly, the commission also dismissed Ryanair's claim that the merger would bring efficiency gains that would 
be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices and improved services.
The barriers to entry facing carriers wanting to challenge Ryanair on its home territory were also identified by the 
commission as a factor hindering competition, should the merger go ahead.
Ryanair declined to comment on the commission's stance beyond saying: "We are confident that the remedies are 
radical and hopefully get us over the line [with the commission] this time." The commission declined to comment.
Mr O'Leary said this week that if the commission rejected the merger, the low-cost carrier could consider the case 
for challenging Brussels' decision in the courts.
British Airways and Flybe are believed to be considering the case for running services on some routes where a deal 
between Ryanair and Aer Lingus would leave the merged company in a strong position.
Some other airlines, including EasyJet, have rebuffed Ryanair's request that they compete with the merged 
company.
Brussels' conclusion that a tie-up between Ryanair and Aer Lingus would be more damaging for competition now 
than in 2007 chimes with the Irish flag carrier's own view.
Aer Lingus said in July that the number of routes where it and Ryanair are the only operators had increased from 22 
in 2007 to 44 in 2012.

SAS has long stood for what is wrong with much of Europe's airline industry. The Scandinavian flag carrier has 
been pummelled by low-cost competition as its higher ticket prices and dropping of free food and drinks - save for 
coffee and tea - has driven passengers into the planes of rivals Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair.
At fault was not only a cripplingly high cost base that led to it turning in small profits for a mere two years in the past 
decade, but a relationship between workers and the company that was both complex and unhealthy.
However, SAS's decade-long struggle to restructure itself back to health highlights a broader issue for much of 
European industry, such as its troubled carmakers: could it have benefited from a Chapter 11-style bankruptcy used 
in the US? It is no idle question. Rickard Gustafson, SAS's chief executive, pointedly said last week that all big US 
carriers had been through Chapter 11 protection, which allowed them to slash salaries and pensions while 
continuing in business.
SAS itself has explored several times whether it should declare itself bankrupt. Under Swedish law, there is a 
possibility for a court-ordered restructuring that has some similarities to the American Chapter 11. But crucially 
Sweden has not signed up to an international convention that prevents creditors from seizing aircraft on foreign soil; 
SAS worried that lenders could therefore take ownership of any plane landing in, say, London. Saab, the carmaker, 
also had difficulties in using the procedure when it tried and failed to avoid bankruptcy last year.
Swedish lawyers say that there is little appetite for a full Chapter 11 as there is a strong belief that companies that 
can no longer pay their debts are best declared insolvent, allowing their best assets to be sold off and the rest 
wound down.
Chapter 11 might have lent wings to SAS
But the power of Chapter 11 for turning around companies with big legacy costs can be seen best of all in the 
revival of General Motors and Chrysler in the US. The carmakers closed factories, dumped assets, cut debt and 
slashed labour costs after filing for bankruptcy in 2009. Both rebounded strongly afterwards, with GM refloating on 
the stock exchange the following year and Chrysler now propping up its new majority owner, Italy's Fiat.
Some European countries have sought to implement regimes similar to Chapter 11. The UK has company voluntary 
agreements, much in demand from retailers such as JJB Sports, which has twice used them. France and Spain 
have changed their rules in an attempt to change the dismal statistic that about 90 per cent of insolvencies in both 
countries have ended in liquidation.
When SAS, which is still half-owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark - even if the first two 
would desperately like to sell out - looked at outsourcing its ground handling business five years ago, it quickly 
halted the plans almost immediately. The reason? The company learnt that unions would strike over the critical 
Christmas and New Year period if the deal went ahead.
Similarly, the agreements with its main workers were mind-bogglingly complex: those for pilots ran to 200-300 
pages while those for the cabin crew were more than 100 pages. If the airline wanted to change a route - to fly, say, 
from Stockholm to Berlin rather than Munich - pilots had to be consulted. This went beyond consensual 
Scandinavian labour relations; the employees were essentially running the company alongside management.
All this means that this week's wage deal at SAS is an important breakthrough. A bruising week-long negotiation - 
which dragged on for almost a day after a self-imposed deadline - ended with the eight unions in three countries 
that represent pilots and cabin crew agreeing to new working conditions and pay cuts of up to 15 per cent. The 
worker agreements have shrunk to a more manageable 40 pages.
There is still reason to be sceptical: SAS remains almost entirely dependent on its short-haul operations, which are 
most exposed to ferocious competition and growing passenger indifference to anything other than price. The goal 
expressed by the managers may be to rival Ryanair and Norwegian on costs, but some analysts believe SAS's 
culture as a legacy carrier hinders it from ever being as nimble.
Chapter 11 is not without its flaws - some complain that companies get off relatively easy - but it is of undoubted 
help in dealing with deep-rooted cost problems. Given the state of companies such as SAS and PSA Peugeot 
Citroën, the French carmaker trying to restructure under heavy political pressure, it is little wonder that US 
bankruptcy law is the envy of many European bosses.

Stansted airport would stand to gain an additional 1.4m passengers a year if politicians and the rail industry came 
together to reduce the train journey time from central London to 30 minutes, according to the airport's operator.
Analysis of passenger data suggests a faster rail link - compared with the 47 minutes to an hour required for the 
journey from Liverpool Street Station - would significantly boost the airport's catchment area and could help 
Stansted play a bigger role in solving the south-east's airport capacity crunch.
London's third-biggest airport by passenger numbers is only half full, processing 17m travellers last year and 
attracting the attention of politicians keen to maintain London's hub status but reluctant to expand Heathrow airport.
Boris Johnson, London mayor, has moved from strongly advocating the creation of a new hub airport in the Thames 
estuary to suggesting Stansted could also offer a solution.
But surface transport would prove a sticking point. The architecture firm Make, which last month unveiled a 
masterplan for a four-runway Stansted, included in their vision an extension of the Crossrail line to the airport.
Tim Hawkins, Stansted's director of regulation and planning, said his team had begun talks with Network Rail and 
Abellio, which runs the West Anglia main line, about taking steps toward achieving the 30-minute target over the 
next 15-20 years.
Shorter-term aspirations include the introduction of a 3.20am service from Liverpool Street, improving punctuality of 
trains and achieving a five-minute reduction on the shortest journey times by 2017.
Faster rail link to Stansted urged
Douglas Jack, an aviation analyst with Charles Stanley securities, said the airport - which is being sold by its parent, 
Heathrow airport Holdings - would do well to get its biggest airline customers on board, since landing fees would 
help fund any investment in surface transport.
Ryanair, which dominates Stansted traffic, has dismissed Stansted's lobbying in the past. It said on Thursday: 
"Ryanair hopes that the new owner of Stansted airport will significantly slash prices - rather than worrying about rail 
lines - in order to stimulate rapid traffic growth."
Stansted hired advisory group York Aviation to analyse passenger data gathered by the UK's Civil Aviation 
Authority. As well as suggesting the boost from shorter journey times, it showed about a third of people travelling 
through Stansted started or finished their journeys in central London, with another third coming from or going to the 
east of England.

A raft of upgrades from Barclays gave Europe's airline sector a boost, with Deutsche Lufthansa and Air France-
KLM rallying after analysts said both their restructuring prospects were "fairly valued".
Barclays raised its target price on Deutsche Lufthansa shares from EUR10.25 to EUR11.50 with an "equal weight" 
outlook.
Investors bought into the German flag carrier, sending its shares rallying 4.9 per cent to EUR12.51 against a 0.8 per 
cent gain on the German Xetra Dax index to 7,244.99.
Barclays also raised its target price on Air France-KLM from EUR4 to EUR6.30with an "equal weight" outlook.
Shares in the flag carrier rose 2.6 per cent to EUR6.78 against a 0.6 per cent rise on the French CAC40 index to 
3,498.22.
Ryanair, which recently endured heavy selling, received a fillip as Barclays raised their price target from EUR4.40 to 
EUR4.95.
Shares in the low-cost airline rose 2.4 per cent to EUR4.69.
"The continued revenue strength in airlines has been impressive given the economic backdrop but the outcome has 
been unusual, in our view," the Barclays analysts wrote.
International Airlines Group  was the only airline to maintain an "overweight" outlook. Shares in IAG rose 1.9 per 
cent to 168.10p.
Airlines take off after Barclays upgrades
More broadly across Europe, markets traded in positive territory with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 up 0.6 per cent to 
1,103.43.
News that Veolia Environnement, the French water utility, was on track with its divestments to pay EUR350m worth 
of debt by early next year sent it climbing to the top of the Eurofirst leader board. Its shares rallied 2.9 per cent to 
EUR8.13.
Investors continued to sell out of Eon amid pessimism about the German utility's prospects.
Its shares have taken a beating since the group ditched its profit target for 2013 two weeks ago after warning its 
gas-fired power stations had become "barely profitable". Its shares fell 0.8 per cent to EUR13.93.
Early purchasing managers index data revealed a rise in activity in the eurozone  prompting a "risk-on" mode in the 
markets.
"Risk sentiment could receive further impetus in the coming weeks from a deal on the US fiscal cliff and, to a lesser 
extent, an agreement on Greece's revised second adjustment programme," said Nick Kounis at ABN Amro. "
"These surveys are clearly pointing to a turn in the industrial cycle."

EasyJet founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou failed in an attempt to sling chairman Michael Rake off the board in 
August. But the entrepreneur can at least claim to have lobbied for two moves announced by the low-cost European 
airline.
The first is to adopt a more accurate measure of return on capital employed, which accordingly drops from 14.5 to 
11.3 per cent. The second is to increase recurring dividends (rather than special payouts) from one-fifth to one-third 
of post-tax profits.
The changes are interlinked: the "rocky", as it is called in finance director street slang, is still well ahead of easyJet's 
7.5 per cent cost of capital. So giving a bigger slice to shareholders, including the combative Sir Stelios and his 
family, should be affordable.
The move supported by a £69m jump in full-year pre-tax profits to £317m, dispels any lingering delusion that chief 
executive Carolyn McCall, former boss of struggling Guardian Media Group, lacks the acumen to run an airline.
She has coped well with the other main requirement of her job: coping with Stelios. One might describe his frequent 
interventions as resembling a Greek chorus, were there not a danger that could be misconstrued.
EasyJet should continue to gain from the pain of European flag carriers overburdened with legacy costs, even if 
mean reversion requires disruption costs from strikes and bad weather to rise in 2013. The shares, which trade at a 
narrowing discount to Ryanair, are a good investment.

The UK government should allow the construction of new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports, but 
not back "insane" plans for a new hub in the Thames estuary, Ryanair told a parliamentary inquiry on Monday.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue, told the Commons transport select 
committee that Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports should each get an additional runway over the next 10 to 
15 years.
He attacked proposals for a new airport in the Thames estuary as "insane, stupid, hare-brained". Boris Johnson, 
London's mayor, has backed the idea of an estuary hub, which has been proposed by Lord Foster, the architect, 
among others, because Heathrow is operating at near-full capacity.
Competition regulators have forced Heathrow airport Holdings to sell Gatwick and Stansted airports, and Mr 
O'Leary said extra capacity at all three airports would be good for the aviation industry and consumers.
He questioned the need for the planned independent commission into airport capacity, to be chaired by Sir Howard 
Davies, former head of the CBI employers' organisation.
Simon Buck, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association, whose members include British Airways and 
Virgin Atlantic, said it was important the commission's recommendations secured the backing of the main political 
parties.
He claimed the UK was suffering from 30 to 40 years of indecision by politicians on airport capacity issues, and the 
"worst possible thing" would be another period of inaction after the Davies commission.

SAS was edging towards immediate rescue on Monday morning after the Scandinavian airline signed new wage 
deals with seven of its eight unions representing flight personnel.
Just the Danish cabin crew union was holding out after a marathon overnight negotiating session in which SAS 
missed several self-imposed deadlines in its bid for survival.
Shares in the airline - half owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark - shot up 26 per cent in 
Monday morning trading, reaching SKr7.10, their highest in three weeks.
SAS has agreed a new SKr3.5bn ($517m) credit facility with its banks and shareholders governments but it is 
conditional on all flight personnel signing up to a new wage deal that means up to 15 per cent lower pay and more 
flexible working patterns.
"We need to face the fact that it is all or nothing," Rickard Gustafson, chief executive, told the Financial Times last 
week when asked about what would happen if seven unions signed up and one opposed.
The airline is hoping that a restructuring will save it SKr3bn and that it will get an extra SKr3bn in selling businesses 
such as its ground handling unit and its Norwegian carrier Widerøe.
But some analysts remain sceptical that the plan is sufficient in the long term to help the perennially lossmaking 
airline, which has struggled to turn in a profit throughout the past decade due to its own high costs and the fierce 
competition from the likes of Ryanair and Norwegian Air Shuttle.
SAS close to rescue as unions agree deals
"It is more entertainment than business," said one Danish analyst, saying that international investors lost interest in 
SAS after two rights issues in 2009 and 2010. "A default is clearly in nobody's interest. But it is hard to see it 
suddenly being able to compete with Ryanair."
Sunday's negotiations stretched well into the early hours of the morning as one after another of the unions in its 
three home countries signed up to the deal. But the Danish cabin crew union was long the most sceptical to the 
deal, pointing out last Monday when the plan was announced that it had only just signed up to a new pay 
agreement months ago.
A possible failure of the airline is being seen differently in each of the three Scandinavian countries. Norway is most 
relaxed due to it having both Widerøe and Norwegian Air Shuttle while Denmark is particularly concerned because 
of the number of jobs at Copenhagen airport, an SAS hub that is highly important to the country's biggest 
companies such as Novo Nordisk and Carlsberg.

Santa's elves, facing the logistics challenge of getting goods out of Lapland, may be relieved. SAS, the Sweden-
based airline whose service includes the Finnish province, stepped back from a financial precipice on Monday when 
its unions agreed cost-cutting deals. These are vital if a new $500m credit facility is to flow. Shares in the carrier - 
half-owned by Scandinavian governments and where pre-tax losses have topped SKr12bn ($1.8bn) over the past 
decade - rose 25 per cent to SKr7.
Whether investors elsewhere in Europe's airline industry feel thankful is another matter. Despite four years of 
economic turmoil, consolidation in the sector has been painfully slow. That can be attributed partly to European 
merger policy, which focuses on individual route overlap. This doomed a merger between Greek carriers Olympic 
and Aegean and bodes ill for Ryanair's latest effort to take over Aer Lingus. True, severe financial problems have 
grounded a few players - such as Malev and Spanair. But the big flag-carriers - including Lufthansa and Air France-
KLM - have only become serious about politically-sensitive cost-cutting in the past 12 months. Lufthansa, for 
example, expects to increase capacity by only 0.5 per cent in its passenger airline business this year, with winter 
timetable cuts. In 2011, there was a 10 per cent increase, group-wide, in available seat kilometres. With leading 
low-cost carrier Ryanair also remaining disciplined - it will park 80 aircraft this winter - short-haul yields (ticket 
prices) have generally benefited.
But the big flag-carriers have more resilient long-haul business to help them through tough restructurings. SAS less 
so. Even after Monday's gains, its enterprise value is below SKr10bn ($1.5bn), or less than one-quarter of 
estimated 2012 revenues. That suggests scepticism about SAS's long-term flight path. The elves may not be out of 
the woods just yet.

Virgin Atlantic is on Monday expected to unveil ambitious plans to break into the short-haul domestic market from 
Heathrow after securing extra slots at London's biggest airport to allow it to start flights to Scotland.
The airline, controlled by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group, will announce it has won the bidding for 12 highly-
prized pairs of slots at Heathrow, which International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways, was forced to divest 
as part of its takeover of BMI.
"We have fought hard for the right to fly short haul and take a strong challenge to British Airways within these 
shores," said Steve Ridgway, Virgin Atlantic's chief executive.
The carrier, which has traditionally focused on long-haul destinations, will outline plans to start regular daily services 
between Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Heathrow. The new flights will start at the end of March - the same time as the 
carrier's London to Manchester service, which it announced earlier this year.
Some analysts have expressed doubts about the decision to move into the highly-competitive, short-haul market. 
Large network operators, such as BA, have struggled to make short-haul operations profitable in the face of fierce 
competition from low-cost carriers, such as EasyJet and Ryanair.
But the Virgin's management rejects those suggestions, pointing out that BMI used to provide valuable feeder traffic 
to Virgin Atlantic's long-haul flights at Heathrow. It estimates its nascent short-haul network could generate 1.5m 
feeder passengers per year.
Virgin to start flights to Scotland
"These new routes will provide a strong flow of feed on to our long-haul flights across the Atlantic and beyond. With 
up to a million passengers connecting through Europe each year, the addition of short-haul flying will have a 
material impact on our load factors and yield across much of the network," Virgin Atlantic said.
Sir Richard has dabbled in short-haul flying from the UK in the past but never got beyond a London to Athens 
service, which closed in 2001.
He also launched a Brussels-based short-haul European airline, called Virgin Express, in the 1990s, which 
eventually merged with the remnants of Sabena, the now defunct Belgian flag carrier, and now operates as 
Brussels Airlines, in which Germany's Lufthansa is the biggest shareholder.
Regulators imposed conditions on the slot auction which mean the 12 pairs of daily slots at Heathrow can only be 
used for services to six former BMI destinations: Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Nice, Moscow, Cairo and Riyadh.
Virgin failed to secure the rights to fly to Moscow last month and would need to win similar approval to serve Cairo 
and Riyadh. It could start flying to Nice but it is understood it currently has no plans to do so.
Virgin is considering appealing the Moscow decision, which saw EasyJet granted the licence to serve the Russian 
capital, previously held by BMI.

Heathrow after securing extra slots at London's biggest airport to allow it to start flights to Scotland.
The airline, controlled by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group, will announce it has won the bidding for 12 highly-
prized pairs of slots at Heathrow, which International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways, was forced to divest 
as part of its takeover of BMI.
"We have fought hard for the right to fly short haul and take a strong challenge to British Airways within these 
shores," said Steve Ridgway, Virgin Atlantic's chief executive.
The carrier, which has traditionally focused on long-haul destinations, will outline plans to start regular daily services 
between Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Heathrow. The new flights will start at the end of March - the same time as the 
carrier's London to Manchester service, which it announced earlier this year.
Some analysts have expressed doubts about the decision to move into the highly-competitive, short haul market. 
Large network operators, such as BA, have struggled to make short haul operations profitable in the face of fierce 
competition from low-cost carriers, such as EasyJet and Ryanair.
But the Virgin's management rejects those suggestions, pointing out that BMI used to provide valuable feeder traffic 
to Virgin Atlantic's long-haul flights at Heathrow. It estimates its nascent short-haul network could generate 1.5m 
feeder passengers per year.
Virgin to launch UK short haul
"These new routes will provide a strong flow of feed on to our long-haul flights across the Atlantic and beyond. With 
up to a million passengers connecting through Europe each year, the addition of short haul flying will have a 
material impact on our load factors and yield across much of the network," Virgin Atlantic said.
Sir Richard has dabbled in short-haul flying from the UK in the past but never got beyond a London to Athens 
service, which closed in 2001.
He also launched a Brussels-based short-haul European airline, called Virgin Express, in the 1990s, which 
eventually merged with the remnants of Sabena, the now defunct Belgian flag carrier, and now operates as 
Brussels Airlines, in which Germany's Lufthansa is the biggest shareholder.
Regulators imposed conditions on the slot auction which mean the 12 pairs of daily slots at Heathrow can only be 
used for services to six former BMI destinations: Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Nice, Moscow, Cairo and Riyadh.
Virgin failed to secure the rights to fly to Moscow last month and would need to win similar approval to serve Cairo 
and Riyadh. It could start flying to Nice but it is understood it currently has no plans to do so.
Virgin is considering appealing the Moscow decision, which saw EasyJet granted the licence to serve the Russian 
capital, previously held by BMI.

Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, signalled he was ready for a bruising confrontation with 
trade unions when he presented a sweeping restructuring plan this month for Iberia, IAG's lossmaking Spanish 
subsidiary.
The pugnacious Mr Walsh expressed disappointment that only some people in the European aviation industry 
found him "unreasonable". "I firmly believe part of the problem with our industry is there have been far too many 
reasonable people who have accepted legacy thinking . . . and have left it unchallenged," he said after unveiling 
plans to cut 4,500 jobs at Iberia.
Mr Walsh's comments highlight how many of Europe's so-called legacy airlines - the former state-controlled flag 
carriers - have repeatedly failed to put their companies on a competitive footing with the newer breed of lower cost 
rivals ranging from Ryanair to Emirates Airline. Some are now being pushed to the brink of collapse - SAS, the 
medium-sized Scandinavian airline, warned last week it could go bust unless unions agreed to staff pay cuts of up 
to 15 per cent.
There are signs that the big groups - Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG - are belatedly attacking their unwieldy 
cost bases. As Europe's economic downturn has deepened, managers have outlined significant restructuring 
programmes - exemplified by IAG's plan to cut 22 per cent of the workforce at Iberia. But even if union opposition 
can be overcome, will these turnround plans provide a significant boost to earnings, or are the big carriers simply 
running to stand still?
Legacy airlines struggle amid competition
The case for a radical restructuring at Iberia is overwhelming - it has been running up operating losses for the past 
three years, and this weak performance is threatening to sour last year's merger with British Airways, which is 
profitable.
IAG, the parent group, expects to report a EUR120m operating loss this year, as Iberia struggles with savage 
competition - notably on short-haul routes. Iberia is seeking to return to profit in 2014 by shrinking. In addition to the 
staff reductions, it is cutting aircraft capacity by 15 per cent, as unprofitable routes are abandoned.
Neil Glynn, analyst at Credit Suisse, says the severity of the problems at Iberia stems from how its long-haul 
business is "structurally challenged" because it is a niche operation focused on Latin America - by contrast, 
Lufthansa, Air France and British Airways have large global networks.
His statement highlights the vulnerability at the heart of the flag carriers' business model.
The companies rely on their long-haul flights - and particularly the passengers travelling first and business class - 
for the majority of their revenue and profit, but these businesses are inextricably linked to the carriers' weaker short-
haul operations. Many of the passengers on the long-haul flights have previously transferred from the carriers' 
short-haul operations, and these are widely believed to be lossmaking because of pressure from the budget 
airlines.
This is borne out at Air France-KLM - its short-haul operations made an operating loss of EUR700m in 2011, and 
this more than wiped out the profit at its long-haul business. The group plunged to a net loss of EUR809m last year.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at HSBC, says that while Air France-KLM has been a trailblazer for consolidation - Air 
France's combination with KLM in 2004 was Europe's first big cross border airline merger - the group's cost base 
"has not been effectively managed", particularly in France.
Air France-KLM is the most highly leveraged of the three big European flag carriers, and Jean-Cyril Spinetta, 
appointed chief executive for a second time last year after his predecessor was ousted, is seeking to cut net debt by 
EUR2bn by 2015.
His broader restructuring plan involves ending the losses at the group's short-haul operations in 2014, partly 
through the removal of 5,100 jobs at Air France, or 10 per cent of the French subsidiary's workforce.
But the compromises that managers deem necessary to avoid crippling strike action with their restructuring plans 
were laid bare at Lufthansa last week.
Lufthansa is seeking to end the losses at its short-haul, point-to-point operations in Germany by shunting these 
operations into Germanwings, the group's budget carrier, where staff are paid less compared with the main airline.
A deal with unions representing cabin crew was only reached last week after the company agreed that Lufthansa 
staff who transfer to Germanwings can do so on the same pay and benefits as they currently enjoy.
Overall, however, most analysts welcome the restructuring plan of Christoph Franz, Lufthansa's chief executive, 
because he has set the group an ambitious operating profit target of EUR2.3bn for 2014 - which would be a 
EUR1.5bn improvement on 2011.
This helps explain why some analysts say the flag carriers' restructuring plans should boost earnings over the 
coming years - and their confidence is bolstered by how the big companies have a new-found willingness not to 
flood the market with more aircraft, which is usually followed by cuts in ticket prices.
Other analysts, however, are far less impressed, saying the restructuring plans are likely to suffer the same fate as 
previous ones - they fear any cost savings will get passed back to passengers in the form of lower fares, or be 
offset by high fuel prices.
Legacy airlines struggle amid competition
One analyst, who declines to be named, says that airports and aircraft makers - which can report much higher 
levels of profitability than many airlines - will continue to "eat the airlines' lunch".

Body
Italy's largest initial public offering this year will begin marketing next week after SEA, which manages Milan's 
Malpensa and Linate airports, approved a price range that values the company at as much as EUR1.1bn
Management will begin its presentations to prospective investors in Milan on Monday with the goal of reaching the 
stock market at the beginning of December. If there are no last-minute roadblocks, SEA would be only the second 
IPO on Milan's main market this year, after the April listing of Brunello Cucinelli, a maker of luxury cashmere 
sweaters.
SEA gave no other details of the listing besides the price range of the shares - EUR3.2-EUR4.3 - and the 
corresponding value of the company - EUR800m-EUR1.1bn. According to a person familiar with the plans, a 
quarter of the company will be listed with about half coming from newly issued shares and the rest from the Milan 
province which is selling its stake.
The city of Milan owns 55 per cent of SEA though that will be diluted by the new shares. F2i, an investment fund 
backed by Italian banks, insurance companies and a state-owned entity, owns 30 per cent of SEA.
While the number of passengers who use Milan's airports has been inching higher in the past few years, Italy's 
lingering recession presents a challenge for SEA. In presenting the company to potential investors Giuseppe 
Bonomi, chief executive, will be seeking to leverage Milan's position in the heart of one of Italy's most productive 
and richest regions.
SEA valued at EUR1.1bn ahead of IPO
Malpensa, which carried 19.3m passengers last year and is a 30-minute train ride from downtown, is still a long way 
shy of the numbers it posted in 2007, the year before Alitalia decided to make Rome its only hub and consequently 
cut many flights from Milan. Linate, a few miles from the centre of Milan, can be reached by a city bus.
SEA also has a 31 per cent stake in the company that manages the Bergamo airport 35 miles east of Milan. 
Ryanair's decision to make Bergamo its main entryway into northern Italy has led to a surge in traffic in recent years 
and last year the airport carried almost as many passengers as Linate.
SEA has struggled to build up its customer base since Alitalia's decision five years ago to concentrate on Rome 
and, though the 28m passengers who passed through Malpensa and Linate last year is 3.7 per cent more than in 
2010, it is almost a fifth lower than in 2007. EasyJet filled some of the void with a rapid expansion and now carries 
more than 5m passengers a year though Malpensa.
The introduction in 2009 of a high-speed train linking Milan and Rome has stolen passengers on the most-travelled 
and profitable domestic route and presented SEA with another challenge. Several trains an hour now make the trip 
between the financial centre in the north and Rome in less than three hours, 90 minutes quicker than the fastest 
time of just a few years ago. The time needed to make the train trip continues to inch down as do prices now that 
two train companies compete for customers on the route.

The future of SAS is hanging in the balance after management issued an ultimatum this week to force pilots and 
cabin crew to accept a wage deal that the lossmaking Scandinavian airline says is crucial to its survival.
The board of SAS, which is owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, will meet  on Sunday to 
discuss whether to push ahead with a restructuring plan under which the workforce would be cut by 40 per cent, or 
whether to declare bankruptcy. Banks have made a new SKr3.5bn credit facility conditional on all eight unions of 
flight personnel in the three countries signing up to cuts in wages of up to 15 per cent and pension changes.
Danish unions representing cabin crew and pilots have reacted angrily to SAS discussing the plans with the media 
before them.
Ticket sales have been falling all week and worried owners of frequent flyer points have been using them up rapidly 
as concern grows that SAS could be the latest European airline with too high costs to go under.
Danish business is deeply concerned about what the possible end of SAS would mean for its hub in Copenhagen.
"We are very worried about what is going on. Having a regional carrier with a hub in Copenhagen is extraordinarily 
important for Danish business," Lars Sørensen, chief executive of drugmaker Novo Nordisk, told the Financial 
Times.
SAS is looking to cut costs by SKr3bn and sell SKr3bn in assets to boost its competitiveness compared with low-
cost rivals such as Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair.

In the European airline industry where most flag carriers are walking wounded, SAS stands out as the one in 
intensive care.
The Scandinavian airline has warned staff they have until Sunday to accept deep cuts to pay and pensions or else it 
could go bust.
"This is not just me playing hard ball: this is the brutal reality we are facing. But we have got a chance," Rickard 
Gustafson, chief executive, tells the Financial Times.
The rot set in a long time ago at SAS, which has essentially lost money every year for the past decade, apart from 
two years of small profits. The capital from two rights issues in 2009 and 2010 has all been spent and the main 
shareholders have said there will be no more.
"We have got nothing left to consume. We have hit the end of the road. There is no alternative. It is this, or ," says 
one director.
SAS's four leading shareholders - the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark that together own half of the 
airline, and the Wallenberg family - have agreed to provide a new SKr3.5bn credit facility, but only if a new labour 
agreement is reached by the weekend.
Mr Gustafson is under no illusions as to how difficult a task he is facing. He has to negotiate with eight different 
unions in three countries just to get the pilots and cabin crew on board.
SAS alone in European intensive care
A SAS worker at Oslo's Gardemoen airport sums up the feeling among colleagues when she says: "We feel like we 
have given a lot to this airline. We've had pay freezes, cuts, everything. But I think people see this time it is really 
serious. I can't say what will happen. But we want to survive if we can."
SAS found itself in this predicament due to the deep-rooted problems for legacy carriers of high costs compared 
with newer rivals such as Ryanair, easyJet, and a Scandinavian upstart that just celebrated its 10th birthday: 
Norwegian Air Shuttle.
Mr Gustafson sums up SAS's vulnerability to the fast-expanding Norwegian by saying: "We can't have one 
competitor that we compete with on 60 per cent of our routes if we are not competitive."
On one of the industry's main measures of cost levels - unit costs per available seat flown - SAS has substantially 
higher expenses than Norwegian: Skr0.86 against its low-cost rivals NKr0.45.
That translates into higher ticket prices. On a recent comparison of a return flight from Oslo to Stockholm next 
week, Norwegian had a cheapest price of NKr935 while SAS was close to NKr1,500.
SAS's predicament has been exacerbated by its heavy focus on short-haul operations. Nomura analysts highlight 
how SAS has a different business model to Europe's big flag carriers - Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and International 
Airlines Group - because they secure most of their revenue from long-haul operations,  which usually generate 
more profit than short-haul flights due to the focus on business and first-class travellers.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at HSBC, says SAS's focus on short-haul flights for business travellers moving 
between Scandinavia and Europe left it highly vulnerable to the aggressive expansion of low-cost carriers.
"With low-cost carriers' growth in market share, customers' expectations of the appropriate fare for short-haul air 
transport fell sharply all over Europe but particularly sharply in high-fare Scandinavia," he adds.
Mr Lobbenberg expresses doubts SAS can secure a strategic investor, saying the most plausible candidate - 
Lufthansa - is pursuing a cautious deal-making strategy.
The reason for the deadline of Sunday is clear: any longer and few people would want to buy a SAS ticket.
Already at Gardemoen airport on Tuesday a gallows humour was evident. "I've seen a plane take off today so I'm 
hopeful for now. But I'm less sure about coming back," said one businessman bound for Copenhagen.
Mr Gustafson is trying to look beyond Sunday but admits the situation is perilous. "I honestly believe there is room 
in Scandinavia for a [full-service] carrier. The market is big enough for both of us. But we can't continue if we are 
not cost-efficient Either we face that music and adapt to the new business environment or we don't. We have come 
to the end point."

Comac, China's would-be rival to Airbus and Boeing, has announced 50 new jet orders but also admitted it is still 
struggling to get its planes off the ground.
The state-owned airplane manufacturer on Tuesday said that two Chinese airlines had ordered 20 C919 passenger 
jets each, while a unit of General Electric, its only foreign customer so far, had ordered another 10.
But before the C919 can fly, Comac has pledged to put a smaller regional jet into commercial service, and a Comac 
official said that it could be another two years before that long-delayed aircraft, called the ARJ21, is deemed ready.
With China expected to be the world's biggest market for new aircraft by a large margin over the next two decades, 
Beijing has declared it a strategic priority to develop an indigenous airplane manufacturer so that the country can 
lessen its reliance on Airbus and Boeing.
Comac has been trying to develop the ARJ21, a small plane that would compete against Brazil's Embraer and 
Canada's Bombardier. Initially scheduled for delivery to customers by 2007, it has been beset by problems. The 
deadline was revised to 2011 and then missed again.
"Our plan is to take another one or two years to obtain all the airworthiness certifications," Luo Ronghuai, Comac's 
vice general manager, told local media at Airshow China, a twice yearly event in Zhuhai, southern China.
Comac said in a separate statement that it had started assembling the first ARJ21 for delivery to customers and 
that it was now in the process of installing aviation systems aboard the plane. It also staged a test flight for 
spectators at the air show.
Chinese plane maker receives new orders
The ARJ21 is meant to be a stepping stone for Comac to a bigger prize, the C919, a narrow-body jet that will line 
up against the Airbus A320 and Boeing's 737, the workhorses of the aviation industry.
Comac said that Joy Air and Hebei Aviation Group, two small Chinese airlines, had committed to buying 20 C919s 
each and that GE Capital Aviation Services had asked for 10, bringing its total order to 20. GECAS is co-producing 
the engines for the C919.
It also said that Ryanair and British Airways have expressed interest in buying C919s, though the carriers have yet 
to place formal orders. The C919 has received 380 orders in all, according to Comac.
The plan is for the C919 to begin test flights in 2014, with delivery to customers by 2016. Analysts have warned that 
the delays to the ARJ21 could push back that timeline.

SAS, the perennially lossmaking Scandinavian airline, warned that it was facing its last chance for survival as it laid 
out a drastic cost-cutting plan to slash 40 per cent of workers as well as reducing wages and pensions.
Rickard Gustafson, chief executive, challenged unions to back the plan, even though some have said in advance 
they will fight it, by stressing that SKr3.5bn ($518m) in new loans for the airline was dependent on changes in 
collective agreements.
"This truly is our 'final call' if there is to be a SAS in the future  I know we are asking a lot of our employees, but 
there is no other way," Mr Gustafson said.
The number of workers at SAS would fall from 15,000 to 9,000 under the plan, with 800 administrative staff losing 
their job and several units being sold, including its ground handling operations and its Widerøe regional airline in 
Norway.
Pay would be cut by up to 15 per cent, pensions would be moved from defined benefit to defined contribution in an 
attempt to reduce obligations by more than a half, or SKr18bn, and working conditions would be standardised.
SAS - in which the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark share a 50 per cent stake - has lost money ever 
since 2007, weighed down by its own high costs and hit hard by low-cost competitors such as Norwegian Air 
Shuttle and Ryanair.
SAS warns of 'final call' for survival
The airline is most immediately fighting for survival because of changes in pension accounting that would all but 
wipe out shareholders' equity. SAS said the changes to workers' pensions would reduce the hit to equity by 
SKr2.8bn, rather than by SKr10.7bn without the restructuring measures.
SAS hopes the new plan will boost pre-tax earnings by SKr3bn annually, on top of SKr5bn in improvements 
announced just last year, as well as SKr3bn in divestments. Restructuring costs are expected to be SKr1.5bn and 
the airline said it expected to make a small loss before tax and non-recurring items for this year.

The EU is to serve formal objections against Ryanair's third proposed takeover of Aer Lingus, after Europe's largest 
low-cost carrier by revenues failed to offer concessions that address all Brussels' competition concerns about the 
deal.
The European Commission has made it clear that it will reject what Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, 
described as a "radical" and "unprecedented" remedies package to secure regulatory approval.
According to people involved in the talks, Ryanair has been told that the remedies package falls short of what is 
required to eliminate competition concerns on all routes where the merged Irish carrier would enjoy a dominant 
position.
Although Ryanair said last week it had found airlines willing to provide competition on routes that would otherwise 
be dominated by the merged Irish carrier, the commission concluded the offer was so unsatisfactory it has not 
asked rival airlines to comment on the details - the usual step in assessing significant concessions.
The issuance of a so-called "statement of objections" by the commission will take Ryanair one step closer to its bid 
being blocked for the second time.
In 2007, the commission prohibited Ryanair's first tilt at Aer Lingus on the grounds it would harm consumers by 
creating a near monopoly on some 35 routes to and from Ireland.
Ryanair can improve its offer to the commission at any time. After formal objections are issued, it will have an 
opportunity to challenge the findings and hold a hearing on the deal.
Ryanair 's Aer Lingus remedies rejected
A commission spokesperson declined to comment.
People involved with the talks insist the commission is keeping an open mind and ensuring Ryanair has every 
chance to prove the bid for Aer Lingus can pass the competition test, not least because officials want to ensure the 
decision is legally watertight.
The provisional deadline for a commission decision is early February. It is extremely rare for the commission to 
prohibit mergers and it has never before approved a takeover that is resubmitted.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said he had received "no feedback" from the commission but added he 
believed Brussels would find it "very difficult" to reject the proposed remedies package.
He said there were six airlines willing to provide competition on routes where Ryanair and Aer Lingus overlap, 
although he did not identify them.
British Airways and Flybe are believed to be considering the case for operating services on routes where the Irish 
carriers overlap.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, British Airways' parent, confirmed the company had held discussions with Mr 
O'Leary, adding: "If there was some benefit to us in dialogue with Ryanair - in the event they are successful [with 
the Aer Lingus bid] - we certainly will do that."
Jim French, Flybe's chief executive, declined to comment.

International Airlines Group warned on Friday that Iberia, its lossmaking Spanish subsidiary, was in a "fight for 
survival" and unveiled sweeping plans to cut 4,500 jobs at the Madrid-based carrier.
The reduction amounts to more than 20 per cent of Iberia's workforce, but IAG said there could be deeper cuts if 
the company did not reach agreement with trade unions by the end of January.
IAG, formed from the merger of British Airways and Iberia last year, expects to record an operating loss of 
EUR120m for 2012, principally because of the Spanish unit's problems.
For the nine months to September 30, IAG reported a loss before tax of EUR169m, compared to a profit of 
EUR355m in the same period last year.
While British Airways recorded an operating profit of EUR286m in the first three quarters of this year, Iberia made a 
loss of EUR262m.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said: "Iberia is in a fight for survival and we will transform it to reduce its cost 
base so it can grow profitably in the future."
As well as the Spanish recession, Iberia is struggling with strong competition from low-cost airlines led by Ryanair 
and easyJet.

If Iberia's flights arrived as late as its restructuring, the Spanish airline would have been grounded long ago. The 
cutbacks announced on Friday - reducing its fleet by about a quarter and its workforce by a fifth - are the more 
savage for being so delayed. The airline says it must achieve a profitability turnround of at least EUR600m by 2015. 
It made an operating loss of EUR262m in the nine months to September, and is burning through EUR1.7m of cash 
daily. So Iberia is clearly fighting for survival.
The airline's problem is not just Spain's dire economic situation: that mostly provides the sombre mood music. Its 
real problem is that it is not competitive. Iberia is a high-cost, full-service airline in a low-cost, no-frills market. Its 
competitors are Ryanair and easyJet in the short haul market, and Latam Airline Group - the product of a merger of 
Brazilian and Chilean airlines - in long haul. International Airlines Group, its parent, wants Iberia to match the group 
return on capital of 12 per cent. In other words, it is time Iberia started pulling its weight inside IAG. So much for the 
"merger of equals" with British Airways.
There are two glimmers of hope for Iberia. One is to integrate Vueling - the Barcelona-based low-cost carrier of 
which IAG bought full control this week - to make it the short haul model. Vueling's unit costs are 10 per cent below 
those of easyJet and on a par with Iberia's existing low-cost carrier, according to Credit Suisse. The second is to 
leverage Iberia' strength in linking Europe to Latin America. But the execution risk associated with restructuring a 
legacy flagcarrier are considerable: there is likely to be fierce trade union and political opposition to Iberia's plan in 
Spain.
BA turned its fortunes around before the IAG merger; that is what Iberia needs to do now. The risk is that it is 
rushing to catch a flight that has already closed.

Crédit Agricole capped a difficult week for European banks on Friday as the French lender reported a wider than 
expected net loss following the sale of its Greek unit.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended flat on the final session of a volatile week at 1,097.18. Over the 
week, the index fell 1.6 per cent.
Following the excitement of the US presidential election, investors appeared to refocus on the miserable state of the 
eurozone economy. Analysts suggested also that the rising proportion of corporate earnings failing to match market 
expectations were prompting suspicions that equity valuations may have become stretched following the recent 
rally.
Crédit Agricole led a long list of financial services groups lower on Friday. Its stock shed 5.9 per cent to EUR5.57 
after posting a EUR2.85bn loss in the third quarter as it paid heavily to terminate operations in Greece and booked 
losses on the valuation of other assets.
The company, which incurred EUR1.96bn in charges on the sale of Greek unit Emporiki Bank and EUR181m on the 
divestment of its Cheuvreux broking unit, added that offers for its 20 per cent stake in Italy's Bankinter had been 
disappointing.
A poor week for banks left Crédit Agricole's shares down 6.9 per cent over the five sessions, but there were worse 
performances elsewhere during the week after many of Europe's biggest lenders reported a poor third quarter. 
Crédit Agricole is not alone on the divestment trail, as many banks have either refocused on core domestic 
Banks drive European equities lower
operations, or have hived off investment banking from retail operations. This effort to cut costs and restructure has 
made comparisons with previous years' profit statements difficult.
Commerzbank fell 5.9 per cent to EUR1.33 and was down 12.5 per cent over the week after the German lender 
said on Thursday it was unlikely to pay a dividend until 2014 and that it did not expect a profit from its retail unit next 
year. On Friday brokers at Nomura cut Commerzbank's target price from EUR1.30 to EUR1.20 and held its 
"reduce" rating.
Domestic rival Deutsche Bank also had a tough week, falling 5.9 per cent to EUR33.52 over the five sessions, while 
top Spanish banks BBVA and Santander fell 6 per cent to EUR6.11 and 5.6 per cent to EUR5.52 respectively.
Irish airline Ryanair made the best weekly performance, up 8.4 per cent to EUR4.93, after it raised its full-year 
targets on Monday. The company defied subdued consumer confidence and weak global growth to post 15 per cent 
growth in third-quarter revenues.
Novo Nordisk, the Danish drugmaker, had a turbulent week, falling nearly 7 per cent on Tuesday after the US Food 
and Drug Administration said the company's long-acting insulin drug Degludec carried a higher heart safety risk 
than other similar diabetes treatments. However, the shares bounced back 7.3 per cent to DKr928 on Friday after 
the FDA recommended approval of the drug. Over the week, the shares were up 0.9 per cent.
Reinsurers outperformed other financial sectors after all three Eurofirst groups - Hannover Re, Swiss Re and 
Munich Re - reported forecast-beating third quarters and predicted limited impact from storm damage caused by 
hurricane Sandy in the US. Over the week, Hannover gained 4.5 per cent to EUR55.67, while Swiss added 2.6 per 
cent to SFr65.95 and Munich rose 2.3 per cent to EUR126.90.

Crédit Agricole led European equity markets lower on Friday after posting a wider than expected net loss following 
the sale of its Greek banking unit.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.3 per cent to 1,094.55, its third successive loss since President 
Barack Obama's US election win catalysed a global equity market sell off. Over the week so far, the index has

International Airlines Group warned on Friday that Iberia, its lossmaking Spanish subsidiary, was in a "fight for 
survival" and revealed sweeping plans to cut 4,500 jobs at the Madrid-based carrier.
The reduction amounts to more than 20 per cent of Iberia's workforce, but IAG said there could be deeper cuts if 
the company did not reach agreement with trade unions by the end of January.
The unions responded by threatening strike action, but Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, insisted that he was 
ready to deal with a "winter of discontent".
"Iberia is in a fight for survival and we will transform it to reduce its cost base so it can grow profitably in the future," 
he said.
IAG, formed from the merger of British Airways and Iberia last year, expects to record an operating loss of 
EUR120m for 2012, principally because of the Spanish unit's problems.
Mr Walsh, British Airways' former chief executive, said he had no regrets over the merger with Iberia. However, he 
stressed that IAG was not planning more deals following its bid to secure control of Vueling, the Spanish low-cost 
carrier.
Sepla, the Spanish pilots' union, denounced Iberia's turnround plan, saying: "We are completely aghast at a plan 
that wants to destroy Iberia."
Iberia in fight for survival, chief says
The union organised a series of strikes at the end of last year and early this year in protest at Iberia's creation of a 
new budget carrier called Iberia Express, where staff are paid less than at the main airline.
Sepla's members are restricted from striking while arbitration is under way over the Iberia Express dispute, but 
Justo Peral, head of the union's Iberia section, warned: "We are not going to negotiate this turnround plan."
For the nine months to September 30, IAG reported a loss before tax of EUR169m, compared with a profit of 
EUR355m in the same period last year. While British Airways recorded an operating profit of EUR286m in the first 
three quarters of this year, Iberia made a loss of EUR262m.
As well as the Spanish recession, Iberia's short-haul operations are struggling with aggressive competition from 
low-cost airlines led by Ryanair, while its long-haul network to Latin America is up against stronger rivals such as 
Latam Airline Group, the new carrier formed from a merger of Brazilian and Chilean airlines.
Iberia is burning up cash at a rate of EUR1.7m each day. The turnround plan aims to halt the cash bleed by the 
middle of next year and return the carrier to profit by 2014.
The 4,500 job losses would affect pilots, cabin crew and other staff, and the remaining 15,500 staff face salary 
reductions. Iberia is also cutting capacity by 15 per cent by scrapping lossmaking routes and removing 25 aircraft 
from its 110-strong fleet.
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Espírito Santo, described the Iberia restructuring as "radical", but said the problems at the 
carrier were "systemic".
"We continue to believe the market has underestimated the scale and nature of the challenge faced by Iberia," he 
said.
For the three months to September 30, IAG reported revenue of EUR5.1bn, up 12.6 per cent compared with the 
same period last year, and operating profit after exceptional items of EUR263m, down 25 per cent.
IAG's shares rose 1.5 per cent to 170.6p.

low-cost airlines led by Ryanair, while its long-haul network to Latin America is running into stronger rivals such as 
Latam Airline Group, the new carrier formed from a merger of Brazilian and Chilean airlines.
Rafael Sánchez-Lozano, Iberia's chief executive, said the carrier was burning EUR1.7m of cash every day.
"Iberia has to modernise and adapt to the new competitive environment as its cost base is significantly higher than 
its main competitors in Spain and Latin America," he added.
IAG's turnround plan for Iberia aims to stem its cash losses by mid-2013. It proposes unspecified salary reductions 
for staff, the suspension of lossmaking routes, and a reduction of 25 aircraft in Iberia's 110-strong fleet, mainly in 
short-haul operations.
IAG is also proposing to secure full ownership of Vueling, the Spanish low-cost airline, and analysts said it could be 
used as Iberia's main domestic short-haul carrier.
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Espirito Santo, described the Iberia restructuring as "radical", but said the problems at the 
carrier were "systemic" and predated the Spanish recession.
"We continue to believe the market has underestimated the scale and nature of the challenge faced by Iberia," he 
added.
IAG reported revenue of EUR13.6bn for the nine months to September 30, up 10.8 per cent compared to the same 
period in 2011, and operating profit after exceptional items of EUR9m, compared to EUR383m one year ago.
IAG's expected EUR120m operating loss in 2012 also reflects its acquisition of BMI British Midland from Lufthansa, 
which was completed in April. BMI has been lossmaking.

From Mr Alistair Craig.
Sir, I enjoyed reading John Kay's article "London's new airport held to ransom by folly" (November 7) but am 
intrigued by his assertion about Stansted's inadequacies. I have used Stansted and perhaps, if only from the tone of 
his article, may have overflown Prof Kay in the process.
Stansted has, in fact, excellent rail communications both to the City of London, where most of your UK readership 
probably work, and to Cambridge and Birmingham. That rail network will shortly be connected to Crossrail, linking it 
both with the City and the west of London, and could also be upgraded to high-speed at relatively little expense. 
The airport lies on the M11 and is close to the M25.
The fact that some airlines, most of them considerably less successful than Ryanair and easyJet, have been 
reluctant to use it would only support the argument that the market does not always recognise a good thing when it 
sees it.
Prof Kay's reference to Mr Justice Roskill's conclusion in 1968 that too many flight paths cross London was a gem 
that still holds good. Why so many Londoners, who provide the financial lifeblood of this country, should be 
disturbed in their homes by non-visiting hub-users is anyone's guess.
As a keen reader of the FT, I have noticed that since the summer you have published articles and reports generally 
supporting or referring to expansion at Heathrow, the most recent being four runways rather than three. I hope that 
this only reflects successful lobbying and not editorial concerns about the possible future relocation of flight paths 
that millions of those living in London currently have to endure.
Alistair Craig, London SE21, UK

International Airlines Group is on Friday expected to unveil a wide-ranging restructuring of Iberia, its lossmaking 
Spanish subsidiary, after agreeing to acquire full ownership of Barcelona-based low-cost carrier Vueling.
Analysts are predicting that 4,000 jobs could be axed at Iberia, which is set to be boosted by the EUR113m deal to 
take control of its domestic low-cost rival. The restructuring will be detailed by Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, 
on Friday.
IAG was formed from the merger of British Airways and Iberia last year, and the group has quickly run into 
difficulties because of the Spanish unit's troubles. IAG expects to record an operating loss this year.
Iberia has been reporting operating losses for three years, partly because its short-haul operations are reeling from 
low-cost competitors led by Ryanair and easyJet.
In March, IAG started Iberia Express, a budget carrier paying lower salaries than the main Iberia airline, but Sepla, 
the Spanish pilots union, responded by organising a series of strikes.
Andrew Light, analyst at Citi, said IAG's acquisition of Vueling would put pressure on the unions to accept cost-
cutting at Iberia's short-haul operations or risk seeing them close.
IAG proposed on Thursday to buy the 54 per cent of Vueling it does not already own through a cash tender offer 
priced at EUR7 a share - a 28 per cent premium to the closing price on November 7.
Job cuts loom as IAG buys Spanish rival
Mr Walsh said: "With its leading position in Barcelona, European growth strategy and low-cost base, Vueling has 
much to offer IAG."
IAG's shares were down almost 1 per cent at 168p on Thursday. Vueling's shares were up 25 per cent at EUR6.85.
Some analysts said Vueling, as well as supplying valuable feeder traffic for Iberia's long-haul network based out of 
Madrid, could provide IAG with its main low-cost, short-haul platform in Spain if Iberia Express's future continues to 
be shrouded in legal uncertainty.
The Spanish government's efforts to use an arbitrator to mediate between Iberia and the pilots union have 
stumbled, with the company resorting to court action.
Neil Glynn, analyst at Credit Suisse, highlighted the depth of Iberia's problems by saying it could struggle to break-
even at the level of operating profit by 2015.
He said Iberia needed to cut its labour costs by up to EUR300m, which meant between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs may 
have to be cut - 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the workforce.

Aer Lingus spent EUR50m fighting off Ryanair

Aer Lingus has said it has been forced to spend EUR50m in legal and consultancy fees to fight Ryanair's repeated 
takeover bids - but remains confident that European authorities will block the rival airline's latest approach.
"The whole bureaucracy of a takeover approach means a huge amount of money spent defending ourselves," said 
Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus chief executive, after the company released third-quarter results on Wednesday. 
"This is more than we have ever paid to shareholders in dividends."
Ryanair's EUR1.30 per share bid for Aer Lingus is the company's third attempt to take over its Irish rival in six 
years. In 2007, the European Commission prohibited Ryanair's first takeover bid for Aer Lingus, saying that the 
combined entity would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or dominant position on 35 routes to and 
from Ireland.
To support its latest bid, Ryanair has submitted a draft remedies package to the commission, which involves getting 
other airlines to commit to take over 35 routes to Europe where the proposed takeover would result in a monopoly 
situation.
However, Mr Mueller said he felt sure that Brussels would still block the takeover.
"We have always believed that, with 85 per cent of routes overlapping, a takeover would lead to a monopoly," he 
explained. "I believe an 85 per cent route overlap cannot be mitigated [by remedies]."
Aer Lingus spent EUR50m fighting off Ryanair
In its results statement, Aer Lingus reported a slight fall in operating profits in the three months to September 30, 
compared with the same period last year. It said business demand for its core London route had weakened during 
the Olympic Games, and fuel and airport charges had increased.
Nevertheless, the Irish airline said it enjoyed a strong quarter with revenues growing and forward bookings stronger 
than they were at the same period last year.
Revenues in the period were up by 5.7 per cent year-on-year, to EUR460.8m, driven by a strong performance in its 
long haul business. But operating costs increased 8.1 per cent to EUR369.9m, as higher fuel prices and a 
weakening euro led lifted overall fuel costs 27.7 per cent. As a result, operating profit in the third quarter fell to 
EUR90.9m, from EUR93.6m in the same period in 2011.
Aer Lingus also said it is bracing itself for possible industrial action. Unions have served strike notice on Aer Lingus 
and are planning a two-hour work stoppage on November 19 at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports as part of a 
dispute over how to deal with a EUR748m deficit in an employee pension scheme.
Mr Mueller said he was optimistic that a strike could be averted, following talks with unions. He said Aer Lingus was 
willing to part fund a new contributory pension scheme.

International Airlines Group said on Wednesday that it was considering seeking full ownership of Vueling, the 
Spanish low-cost carrier.
Analysts said the potential move was part of its efforts to try to improve the competitiveness of Iberia, its troubled 
Spanish subsidiary.
IAG was formed by the merger of British Airways and Iberia in 2011. The group expects to report an operating loss 
this year because of the Spanish unit's problems.
Iberia reported an operating loss of EUR263m in the six months to June 30 and Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive, 
is set to reveal a far-reaching restructuring of the airline on Friday that unions fear could involve thousands of job 
losses.
Iberia owns 46 per cent of Vueling, which has a market capitalisation of EUR171m.
IAG said it could "confirm that it is considering making an offer for 100 per cent of the share capital of Vueling", 
adding that its board would consider the matter on Thursday.
It stressed no final decisions had been taken, including on the offer price, and would not comment further. Vueling 
declined to comment.
Iberia is suffering partly because of the Spanish recession, but its short and medium-haul operations are under 
acute pressure from competitors, led by Ryanair.
IAG targets full control of Vueling
In March, IAG started Iberia Express, a low-cost, short-haul carrier at which staff were paid less than at the main 
Iberia airline, but the new group's future had become mired in legal uncertainty.
Sepla, the Spanish pilots' union, called a series of strikes at the end of last year in protest at the establishment of 
Iberia Express and Spain's government intervened by sending the issue to arbitration.
IAG objected to a May ruling that required Iberia to put all its pilots on the same pay scale and this week a Spanish 
court declared the arbitration process flawed.
Analysts said IAG might drop Iberia Express and develop Vueling as its low-cost, short-haul carrier. Vueling could 
also provide feeder traffic for the main airline's long-haul operations, which are heavily focused on Latin America.
Vueling reported revenue of EUR882.7m for the nine months to September 30 and a net profit of EUR41.3m.
Douglas McNeill, analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, said: "There is a risk of legal wrangles preventing IAG from 
expanding Iberia Express as quickly as it would like and a bid for Vueling may provide another solution to the 
challenges facing Iberia in short-haul."

London's airports are operating close to capacity. Noise levels around Heathrow are unacceptable. The location of 
Heathrow requires that too many flight paths cross the centre of London. Any proposed solution to these problems 
attracts vociferous objection. What is needed is an independent, radical review of options, which will not report 
before the next election.
This is not a story from 2012, but from 1968. The inquiry established then was chaired by Mr Justice Roskill. The 
one just commissioned is to be chaired by Sir Howard Davies. Not much else has changed - except that London's 
airports then catered for 15m passengers. The Roskill Commission anticipated rapid growth in air transport, 
speculating that by the end of the century London might have to accommodate 100m passengers. Not a bad 
estimate; the actual number was 115m.
The commission concluded that a new airport should be built to the northwest of London at Cublington, between 
Aylesbury and Milton Keynes, with matching improvements to road and rail links. The report is a model of 
dispassionate analysis. Although its reliance on cost benefit analysis was widely criticised, that analysis was not 
employed to make decisions but used as a guide to the careful organisation of evidence. The contrast between the 
work of the commission and the dismal quality of the material supporting the proposed new high-speed rail link to 
Birmingham is a measure of how far standards of evidence in policy making have declined.
Not that the excellence of the Roskill Commission's work did them or us much good. A government of different 
complexion rejected its findings immediately. A scheme to build an airport at Foulness, on Maplin Sands in the 
Thames Estuary, was chosen instead. This option had been considered by Roskill and decisively rejected. The new 
airport was too expensive to build, too far from London and on the wrong side of the city for most prospective 
London's new airport held ransom by folly
passengers. The poor location would not only greatly increase travel times but also lead airlines to use other 
airports to the south and west of London, or on the continent of Europe.
Neither Foulness nor Cublington was built. The complexion of the government changed yet again. After some 
delay, another scheme was devised: a limited expansion of an existing airport at Stansted, near Cambridge. More 
than a decade later, the newly privatised British Airports Authority used the money generated from its cash cow at 
Heathrow to finance that project.
Stansted was also considered by Roskill, but never made the shortlist of serious options and has been a predictable 
failure. No airline has successfully operated long-haul flights from it. The expansive and expensive Norman Foster 
terminal was saved from being a white elephant by the growth in the 1990s of low-cost airlines, for whom attractive 
landing charges at Stansted offset the inconvenience to their passengers of getting there. The principal carrier is 
Ryanair.
Cublington was almost certainly the right answer in 1971 when Roskill reported. It might still be the right answer but 
the scale and complexity now involved in creating a wholly new facility in the English countryside would be orders of 
magnitude greater. Delay has multiplied the constraints and while Roskill was faced with a menu of choices, Sir 
Howard confronts one with no palatable dishes at all. And whatever the government decides after his work is 
completed, aircraft will disturb the residents of west London for many years yet, and travellers will continue to circle 
the city as business flights from newly emerging economies land at Paris and Frankfurt.
One might feel consoled if there were even slight signs that the lessons of bad policy making had been learnt. But 
the prevarication and political posturing, the persistent incrementalism when bold actions are required, the 
readiness to oppose policies simply because they have been espoused by somebody else, are as characteristic of 
policy today as they have been for the past 50 years. Models are more elaborate but less useful, and grossly 
misused. And, as Roskill pointed out, the 100,000 people who might have been adversely affected by a rational 
policy are encouraged to shout far louder than the 100m who would benefit.

Recession traditionally favours no-frills airlines as fliers prune travel costs. But add in current capacity restraint at 
European flag carriers - Lufthansa's capacity, for example, was flat this summer and is expected to dip 2 per cent 
this winter - and low-cost rivals have extra flexibility.
The benefits were clear on Monday when Ryanair reported a 15 per cent jump in revenues for the six months to the 
end of September, at EUR3.1bn, with after-tax profits rising 10 per cent to EUR600m. Passenger numbers were up 
7 per cent year on year. But the Irish carrier also pushed through fare increases averaging 6 per cent. Better still, 
ancillary revenues rose by a fifth to EUR585m, largely thanks to some passengers' willingness to pay for reserved 
seats or priority boarding. The result: an impressive 7 per cent yield increase. The cost side, meanwhile, was kept 
commendably tight: aside from a 24 per cent fuel bill jump, to EUR1.1bn, unit costs rose just 2 per cent.
Can Ryanair keep this up? With legacy carriers such as Lufthansa and Air France-KLM restructuring, survival 
issues hanging over some smaller European airlines, and the low-cost carrier itself grounding 80 planes again this 
winter, the short-term answer should be yes. Whether Ryanair's long-term target of 50 per cent growth in 
passengers and market share in the next decade can be achieved is harder to assess - although betting against the 
carrier has rarely been wise.
The question for investors is whether Ryanair is best placed to benefit from current sector dynamics. The shares, 
up 6 per cent on Monday, trade on 15 times 2012-13 consensus earnings, and 13 times the 2013-14 figure. 
EasyJet, which stands to gain from the same trends, is on 10 times consensus earnings for 2012-13. Ryanair's 
record and strong balance sheet deserve a premium. But the differential is starting to look pricey.

Ryanair shares climbed on Monday after the budget carrier boosted its full-year profit guidance on the back of 
higher fares, lower fuel costs and a jump in passenger numbers over the summer.
The low-cost airline, which is awaiting the outcome of a European Commission regulatory probe into its bid for Irish 
flag carrier Aer Lingus , on Monday reported a 7 per cent year-on-year increase in first-half passenger numbers to 
48m.
The increase in short-haul passengers in the six months to September 30 pushed up revenues from EUR2.7bn to 
EUR3.1bn (£2.5bn), while pre-tax profit rose 9 per cent to EUR679m.
The Dublin-based carrier attributed the increase to "a combination of strong summer bookings, particularly post the 
Olympics, a 6 per cent rise in average fares, and lower than forecast fuel bill".
The stronger figures encouraged the Irish airline to increase its underlying profit guidance for the 12 months to the 
end of March - which includes the usually loss-making winter period - by about 20 per cent to EUR490m-EUR520m.
The news pushed up Ryanair shares 9 per cent to EUR4.96 in early trading.
"We expect market conditions in Europe to remain tough as recession, austerity, high fuel costs and taxes damp air 
travel demand," said Michael O'Leary, chief executive.
"Further airline failures and consolidations are inevitable given the fragmentation among European airlines and the 
existence of so many high-cost, high-fare airlines with poor punctuality records."
Ryanair raises full-year forecast
Mr O'Leary's statement came as Ryanair reiterated its hope that its submission of a "revolutionary" package of 
remedies would assuage European Commission competition concerns about its bid for Aer Lingus.
Ryanair has warned that if its third bid for the Irish flag carrier were blocked by Brussels it would sell its stake and 
Aer Lingus would inevitably be broken up.
In 2007, the Commission prohibited Ryanair's first takeover bid for Aer Lingus, saying that the combined entity 
would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or dominant position on 35 routes to and from Ireland.
Ryanair's first-half diluted earnings per share rose from 36.56 cents to 41.2 cents, and a special dividend of 34 
cents a share - approved at its general meeting in September - will be paid at the end of this month.
Ancillary revenues, such as commissions on hotel and car rentals, rose 20 per cent to EUR584m.
"Ryanair has an exceptionally strong balance sheet - with gross cash in excess of EUR3.9bn and net cash of 
EUR250m," said Gert Zonneveld, analyst at Panmure Gordon.
"Average fares should benefit from the deceleration and eventual standstill in its network capacity growth, culling 
underperforming capacity in favour of high return/lower cost routes and possibly higher competitor fares."

Global economic weakness and subdued consumer confidence had little impact on Ryanair's first-half results and 
sent the shares to the top of a struggling FTSE Eurofirst 300 on Monday.
The Irish airline jumped 5.8 per cent to EUR4.81 after reporting a 15 per cent rise in revenues to EUR3.1bn in the 
six months to the end of September, thanks to higher fares, while lower fuel costs helped boost net profit by 10 per 
cent to EUR596m. Ryanair also raised its full-year targets.
The results sparked a series of target price increases. Davy Research raised its target on the shares to EUR5.50 
from EUR5, while Investec lifted its target to EUR5 from EUR4.40.
"Ryanair is demonstrating strong current trading and a commitment to targeting market share gains in European 
short-haul," said James Hollins at Investec.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300, however, fell 0.6 per cent to 1,108.9 as investors turned cautious ahead of a packed 
calendar of economic and political events, which include Thursday's meeting of the governing council of the 
European Central Bank.
Shares in the eurozone periphery fell the most sharply. Spain's Ibex 35 fell 1.9 per cent to 7,818.6 led lower by 
banks after the ECB said it may have contravened its own lending terms on loans to Spanish financial institutions.
BBVA fell 3.1 per cent to EUR6.30, while Bankia shed 3 per cent to EUR1.16.
The FTSE MIB index fell 1.4 per cent to 15,544.4, as banks were also weaker on the Milan exchange.
Ryanair shares defy weak markets
TNT Express fell 1.9 per cent to EUR7.94 after the Dutch logistics company's biggest shareholder PostNL reported 
a third-quarter loss and was doubtful about whether it would pay a dividend.
PostNL fell 11 per cent to EUR2.77 after it reported operating losses of EUR128m, due to one-off costs and a 
decline in the value of its 30 per cent stake in TNT.
German mail and logistics group Deutsche Post, meanwhile, fell 2.1 per cent to EUR15.32 after the country's 
competition authority said it was investigating allegations of price undercutting which may have forced rivals out of 
the mail delivery market.

Global economic weakness and subdued consumer confidence had little impact on Ryanair's first-half results and

"Ryanair is demonstrating strong current trading and a commitment, that is well-funded, to targeting considerable 
market share gains in European short-haul," said James Hollins at Investec.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300, however, fell 0.5 per cent to 1,109.95 as investors turned cautious ahead of a packed 
calendar of economic and political events, including the US presidential election on Tuesday, and Thursday's

Shares in the eurozone periphery fell the most sharply as the bond yields of Spain and Italy crept higher. Spain's

Ryanair has increased the number of seats passengers can reserve on its flights, in a further example of low-cost 
carriers adding premium services for customers willing to pay extra.
The company on Thursday said it would take reservations on one additional front-of-cabin seating row and one 
additional mid-cabin row, following strong demand for the four rows of reserved seats it already offers - particularly 
on medium-haul flights such as those to the Canary Islands.
Ryanair's move follows the decision by rival easyJet to roll out cabin-wide allocated seating across all flights - a 
change that has cost the company about £10m on IT systems but could significantly boost revenues.
EasyJet passengers pay between £3 and £12 for allocated seating. Ryanair will charge passengers an additional 
£10-£15 for a reservation.
However, industry experts say the low-cost operators' new seating policy would also win them more passengers, 
particularly business travellers who tend to book closer to their travel dates and therefore at higher rates.
Gert Zonneveld, an analyst with Panmure Gordon, estimated that allocated seating would add at least £45m to 
easyJet's top line annually from fees alone. "There's also a whole army of people out there who don't really want to 
fly with easyJet or Ryanair because they don't like the stampedes or the queues, and this could bring those people 
in."
Ryanair said that while a quarter of its customers travel for business, it was demand from families wanting to sit 
together that had spurred its latest move.
Ryanair increases reserved seats
Seat reservations are not the only ploy by budget carriers to entice people in who normally travel with full-service 
airlines. A number of the budget brands offer priority boarding, while Wizz Air, the private eastern European-
focused airline, is in the final stages of testing one of the low-cost sector's only loyalty programmes.
Rather than allowing customers to accumulate frequent-flyer miles or points, Wizz Air will sell a EUR30 card that 
gives holders a EUR10 discount on all flights flown over the next year. The company is also targeting families by 
offering the discount to up to nine relatives or friends travelling with the cardholder.
Mr Zonneveld said he would not be surprised to see Ryanair following easyJet's path towards cabin-wide allocated 
seating: "If easyJet can manage to do this with minimal impact on turnround times, I think Ryanair will also do it. 
There's no down side."
Ryanair said it had no such plans, but remains open to adding further rows of reserved seats ahead of the busy 
summer period, depending on demand.

SAS is seeking to cut costs by SKr3bn ($453m) and sell a similar amount of assets as the lossmaking Scandinavian 
airline tries to avoid tapping sceptical investors including the region's governments for money.
Rumours have swirled around the company for weeks as an imminent pension accounting change has fuelled 
worries about its profitability and balance sheet, already heavily weakened by low-cost competitors such as Ryanair 
and Norwegian Air Shuttle.
SAS, which is half owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, responded on Tuesday by pre-
announcing its third-quarter results, which show a pre-tax profit of SKr568m.
It said it was finalising "a comprehensive plan to fundamentally address its costs on a long-term basis", with some 
local news reports suggesting pay cuts of up to 25 per cent could be included. The SKr3bn boost to pre-tax profits 
from the plan would help offset any writedown because of the accounting change - last estimated at about SKr11bn 
by the airline, which would all but wipe out its equity.
The Stockholm-based airline has struggled for years with a bloated cost base against its nimbler low-cost rivals, 
which have actively targeted the Nordic region because of its high ticket prices.
SAS added that it wanted to sell SKr3bn of non-core assets to try to reduce what it called its "long-term dependency 
on third-party funding" in the future.
SAS plans $453m cuts and assets sale
The Norwegian government has previously suggested it would be unwilling to plough more money into the company 
after several cash calls in recent years. Pilots in Widerøe, SAS's regional airline in Norway, have written to the 
government to express their interest in a management buyout, according to local media.

TPG enters race for Stansted

TPG, the US private equity group created out of the buyout of Continental Airlines 20 years ago, has emerged as a 
bidder for Stansted, London's third biggest airport.
The US company has submitted a first-round offer for the £1bn asset and is understood to be up against investors 
including Macquarie, the Australian investment bank, and a partnership between Manchester Airports Group (MAG) 
and Melbourne-based Industry Funds Management.
Stansted was put on the block this summer after BAA, its owner, lost a final attempt to overturn a 2009 Competition 
Commission ruling ordering it to dispose of three airports, including Essex-based Stansted.
While several people close to the talks believe MAG stands the best chance of winning Stansted, TPG would bring 
experience in the aviation sector - as well as a co-founder, David Bonderman, who chairs the board of Ryanair, 
which is Stansted's biggest customer.
Ryanair has blamed BAA's user fees for falling traffic at Stansted, and aviation experts agree a new owner will need 
to work closely with the airline to bring passenger numbers back to 2007 levels, when the airport processed 24m 
travellers annually, compared with 18m last year.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, spoke to several potential bidders earlier this year about taking a stake 
in the airport. But he said last month that BAA, which now calls itself Heathrow after its biggest airport, ruled out any 
sale to a consortium that included Ryanair.
TPG enters race for Stansted
Stansted is one of three airports in the UK where take-off and landing charges are determined by regulators, 
producing steady returns for its owner. The auction drew initial interest from a half-dozen investors around the world 
but only three are understood to have made formal bids.
BAA and its controlling stakeholder, Ferrovial, are expected to give bidders further details of the contest this week, 
including setting a deadline for second-round offers. To make the shortlist, bidders will need to prove they have the 
operating experience necessary to run the airport.
TPG has remained active in aviation since Mr Bonderman bought Continental out of bankruptcy in 1993 and 
created Texas Pacific Group a few months later. Just this spring, it held talks with US Airways about a joint bid for 
American Airlines, which filed for Chapter 11 late last year.
Stansted is expected to sell for a discount to the £1.3bn the UK's aviation regulator estimates its assets are worth. 
But its value could increase dramatically depending on the role UK policy makers decide it should play over the 
coming decades in expanding airport capacity in and around London.
Boris Johnson, London's mayor, has indicated support for expansion at Stansted where he opposes it at Heathrow, 
and other parties have proposed making it the region's new hub airport.

Aegean Airlines, Greece's biggest airline by passenger numbers, has announced plans to buy its smaller domestic 
rival Olympic Air in its second takeover attempt in two years.
The deal values Olympic - a company that lost EUR37.6m last year - at EUR74m, a sum that would be paid in 
instalments to Greek investment company Marfin, which bought Olympic from the government three years ago.
Theodoros Vassilakis, chairman of Aegean, said the deal would help bring down costs through synergies and give 
the combined company the scale to compete.
His company lost EUR38.5m in the six months to September, almost EUR20m more than the same period last 
year, on revenues that had contracted 9 per cent to EUR269m. The fall in sales gained pace from spring to 
summer.
Mr Vassilakis said the combined annual revenues of the two carriers would amount to more than EUR900m, while 
passenger numbers would total almost 9m.
The EU blocked a merger of the two airlines last January, citing "very high, if not monopolistic, market shares on all 
domestic routes and on a number of international routes where both parties operate". This deal is also subject to 
regulatory approval.
Mr Vassilakis said on Monday that the deal was an attempt to cope with the economic crisis in Greece, echoing the 
argument behind the last takeover attempt. "Our subscale size, combined with the effects of the unprecedented 
Greek crisis, restrict our ability to successfully compete within the European and global aviation market ... We are 
Aegean poised to buy rival Olympic Air
faced with the immediate danger of Greek tourism, an industry essential for the country's recovery, becoming 
entirely dependent on foreign carriers with permanent losses in local employment and state revenues."
Under the terms of the deal, Olympic would keep its branding, and flight staff and aircraft would remain separate. 
Aegean operates an all-Airbus fleet of 29 aircraft, while Olympic's 21-strong fleet is dominated by Bombardier 
models.*
The EU's decision last year was the first rejection of an airline merger since it told Ryanair it could not buy Aer 
Lingus in 2007. The Irish low-cost carrier has since bid again for its national rival, and last week submitted proposed 
remedies to competition concerns to European regulators.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, on Monday welcomed the Greek tie-up, calling it "another logical 
merger of two EU airlines operating in the same market". He added: "[It] mirrors this year's British Airways takeover 
of BMI, in the UK, and Ryanair's current offer for Aer Lingus in Ireland."

Tuscan wine estates are not without their high-profile admirers. The musician Sting and Italian designer Roberto 
Cavalli are among those who own estates in the Chianti Classico region. Owners can enjoy the pleasure of drinking 
their own wine while owning an enviable property. It can also make a sound investment, especially if they buy an 
estate where money has already been put into wine production.
Gemma Bruce, Italy consultant to estate agent Aylesford, says: "The most desirable wine properties tend to be fully 
restored, high-end, accompanied by several hectares of high-quality vines."
She is selling a six-bedroom manor house near Panzano, Chianti, in 10.9 hectares, 2.7 of which are vineyards, with 
permission granted to plant a further hectare. For sale at EUR5.5m, it also has a two-bedroom guest house, two 
studio apartments, wine cellar, tennis court and pool.
Nik Barnewitz of Casa in Toscana, part of Savills' Italian network, has noticed another change in vineyard buyers. 
"We are seeing interest from investors from Russia, northern Europe, Singapore and Hong Kong," he says. Tuscan 
wine estates have been bought by overseas purchasers since the 1970s, which is good for the local economy 
because buyers spend money in the restaurants and shops as well as providing employment. For EUR4.5m, 
Barnewitz is selling a restored five-bedroom farmhouse near Gaiole, Chianti, on 82 hectares, five of which are 
planted with Chianti Classico vines.
The best areas for quality wines are around the towns in the Chianti Classico region, and around Montepulciano 
and Montalcino in Val d'Orcia, south of Siena. Chianti Classico is the more expensive region. "The Chianti Classico 
area has become so popular that prices are still going up every year," says Jeremy Onslow-Macaulay of Casa & 
Fruits of the vine
Country Italian Property. "So people are travelling further and going south of Siena, where you can still find 
farmhouses to renovate and where values are around 20 per cent cheaper."
Val d'Orcia is better value because it is further from Florence and the nearest airport is Perugia, only serviced 
internationally by Ryanair flights from the UK.
"We have many clients who want to be able to drink their own wine to enjoy or give it to friends, but don't 
necessarily want to get involved in the actual production of it," says Onslow-Macaulay. They usually employ an 
oenologist to advise them and a wine manager and send the grapes to a co-operative for bottling. It is also possible 
to lease out the vines. Someone not wanting the trouble of owning land at all but still interested in having their own 
wine could buy one of the two remaining apartments at Castello San Donato in Gaiole. Here, they can own a part of 
the vineyard and have the wine bottled for them. Casa & Country is marketing the two and five-bedroom apartments 
for EUR490,000 and EUR2.2m respectively.
Some of the smaller estates have their own wine cellars to press, store and bottle the wine. One such estate, which 
is new to the market, is Il Moro, bought by Coca and Sebastiano Cameli in 2002. The property, near the village of 
San Giovanni d'Asso and the town of Montalcino, where Brunello wine is made, was a ruin at that time. It took a 
year to transform the farmhouse into a comfortable five-bedroom home, after which they planted two hectares with 
French vines, in order to produce a "super Tuscan" wine. A state-of-the-art wine cellar was built in 2006. The wine 
is now sold overseas and to local restaurants with around 7,000 bottles being produced a year. "We've taken it to 
where the wine is perfect, but there is room for a new owner to expand," says Coca Cameli, whose husband died 
last year. Il Moro is for sale at EUR8m through Aylesford.
Someone looking for a bigger project might be interested in a six-bedroom manor house near Panzano in Chianti 
with 13 hectares and wine cellar. Both the house, refurbished in the late 1970s, and cellar, which has been unused 
for five years, need modernisation. It is for sale for EUR3.75m through Casa & Country.
The market for wine estates is not as busy as it has been, so purchasers can negotiate on price. Most smaller wine 
estates are being sold by individuals who bought 20-25 years ago for the same reasons as people are buying now. 
"They are selling because their life has changed due to age, divorce or ill health," says Barnewitz. "They might well 
consider dropping the price by 15-25 per cent because they know they might not find another serious buyer in the 
near future."
Buying a wine estate is not something to be taken lightly. The land vines are grown on has to be a certain type and 
in the right location, the grapes have to be sent off regularly to be tested so that harvesting takes place at exactly 
the right time and then the wine has to be stored, aged and bottled correctly. "Owning a wine estate is for long-term 
investment and enjoyment, not to make an immediate profit from the sale of the wine," says Coca Cameli.

Manchester Airports Group would return Stansted's traffic to 2007 levels within a decade if it were to win the contest 
this autumn for London's third biggest airport, according to the operator's chief executive.
Charlie Cornish said on Tuesday that his plans for Stansted included an improvement of the airport's retail offering 
and better relationships with its airline customers, including Ryanair, the dominant carrier at Stansted.
He also played down the prospect of the sort of big capital investments, such as a new train line into London, that 
would attract resistance from airlines, whose landing fees pay for such projects.
"Stansted's assets are, as we can see it outside in, in pretty good condition, but are there opportunities to improve 
the customer experience with a better retail experience? Probably," he said.
The group, which owns Manchester, East Midlands and Bournemouth airports, is partnering with Australian investor 
Industry Funds Management to bid for Stansted, which owner BAA finally agreed to sell this summer following a 
2009 Competition Commission order.
The partnership is borne out of lessons MAG learnt from its unsuccessful tilt at Gatwick three years ago. "The key 
lesson was to get your equity investments ready and your financing in place," said Mr Cornish, who joined the 
company in 2010.
Under the terms of the deal, IFM will buy 35 per cent of MAG's equity and get half its voting rights if the pair win 
Stansted. They are up against at least one other serious bidder - a consortium led by Australasian group Morrison & 
MAG pledge to boost Stansted traffic
Co - with first-round offers due next week. Other interested parties include Macquarie and Hong Kong billionaire Li 
Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Holdings vehicle.
Mr Cornish argued that operating expertise would be key to putting Stansted - whose traffic has fallen by a quarter 
in five years - back on a growth trajectory. "You need to have the airport knowhow and the relationships with 
customers," he said, pointing out that his team - which includes a former Ryanair commercial director - already 
have experience wooing back a recalcitrant Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary, who quit Manchester airport 
in 2009 but has since returned.
Moreover, while Ryanair represents two-thirds of Stansted's customers, it would account for just a quarter of 
passengers served by an expanded MAG.
But Mr Cornish declined to endorse Mr O'Leary's view that the next runway built in London would be at Stansted. 
"We see Stansted being viable irrespective of the outcome of government deliberations [about airport capacity in 
the southeast]."
Nor would MAG seek, in the short- to medium-term, to make it anything other than a point-to-point, Europe- and 
leisure-focused facility, even as the company seeks to bring more long-haul, business-friendly routes to Manchester 
airport.
MAG would also not seek to buy any of BAA's other airports should they come up for sale, Mr Cornish said. But he 
argued operators that own more than one airport do have an advantage over independent owners - a notion 
rejected by Colin Matthews, his equivalent at BAA, which this week said it would no longer use an umbrella 
company name and instead go by the brands of its individual airports.
"We're fairly certain that the costs we allocate into our smaller airports are lower than they would be under 
independent operators," Mr Cornish said.

Ryanair has bowed out of the competition to buy Stansted airport after saying that owner BAA had indicated it 
would not sell the facility to any bidding consortium that included the low-cost carrier.
The airline, whose customers account for more than two-thirds of Stansted's traffic, had been talking to a number of 
parties interested in London's third-biggest airport, which went on sale in August.
But it said on Tuesday that it had told "all investors/consortia it has held discussions with" that it would not seek a 
part in the bidding process or a minority stake.
It added: "We regret Ferrovial's decision to exclude Ryanair from the Stansted sale process and the failure of the 
Competition Commission to restrain this anti-competitive and anti-customer behaviour by Ferrovial [BAA's 
controlling shareholder]."
BAA and Ferrovial declined to comment.
UK competition authorities would have blocked the airline from taking any more than a 25 per cent stake in the 
airport and could have thrown up problems even for a smaller shareholding.
But analysts pointed out that any buyer of Stansted would eventually need to work with Ryanair to achieve growth 
at a facility that has seen traffic figures fall by a quarter in the past five years. "Ryanair, at least in the near term, are 
the key to growth," said Chris Tarry, an aviation expert.
Ryanair rules out Stansted airport bid
Damian Brewer at RBC Capital Markets questioned the wisdom of BAA excluding Stansted's biggest customer - if 
that was indeed the case. "It would seem strange behaviour and might even be a failure of their statutory duties to 
shareholders to get the most value from the asset," he said, adding that a buyer could always sell a stake to 
Ryanair following a deal with BAA.
First-round bids for Stansted are due by the end of the month. The sale - ordered by the Competition Commission 
in 2009 - is expected to raise about £1bn and attract a handful of global bidders including Manchester Airports 
Group in a partnership with Industry Funds Management of Australia.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, has been a fierce critic of BAA's management of Stansted. He raised 
the prospect of Ryanair taking part in a bid this spring.
But Mr Tarry argued the case for doing so was not clear. "No one has really asked Michael, 'Is this the best use of 
your capital?'," he said. "And if it is, what does that say about Ryanair's model?"
In a further move on Tuesday, the airline backed the position of Aer Lingus - in which it holds a 30 per cent stake - 
that it is not liable for a EUR750m hole in the pension plan for its workers and those of the Dublin Airport Authority.
But Ryanair opposed the Irish flag carrier's proposed EUR100m contribution to the scheme in exchange for a four-
year pay freeze for the vast bulk of its staff.*

The clanging of fenders is getting louder. First, Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne accuses Volkswagen of creating a 
"bloodbath" for automakers in Europe by waging a price war. Now VW's finance chief Hans Dieter Poetsch is 
declaring that some rivals risk going out of business without government aid. "Especially carmakers in southern 
Europe that produce small cars will be affected," he added pointedly, on Thursday. Had anyone failed to notice the 
dire state of Europe's auto industry - struggling to sell 13m cars in western Europe this year, compared with 17m in 
2007 - they have now been thoroughly alerted.
Even so, the ferocity with which these punches are being thrown is unusual. True, consumer product companies 
run innumerable ads comparing the efficacy of their merchandise with that of rivals. But they tend to be coy about 
naming competitors directly, and rarely take vicious slugs at each other's balance sheets. Even warring tech sector 
executives focus their insults on the product. Apple's Steve Jobs once told arch-rival Microsoft it had "no taste". 
Damming, perhaps, but hardly lethal.
And if car companies really want to get ugly, they should look skyward. For decades, bosses in the airline industry 
have slugged each other's companies with brutal directness. Ryanair's Michael O'Leary once accused British 
Airways' board of having "no spine, no balls and no vision". Richard Branson justified the founding of Virgin Atlantic 
by declaring: "I decided there must be room for another airline when I spent two days trying to get through to 
People Express". Investors, though, may sense a correlation. Could it be that the more vicious the mudslinging, the 
worse the industry dynamics? Airline economics were once described by a top executive as "sheer hell". Much the 
same could be said for those of the European auto sector at present. Investors may wish to apply the politeness 
test.

Ryanair has said it is confident of winning regulatory clearance for its bid for Aer Lingus after the submission of a 
"revolutionary" package of remedies to the European Commission to address competition concerns.
It also warned on Friday that Aer Lingus would inevitably be broken up if Ryanair's EUR1.30 per share bid for the 
Irish flag carrier was blocked by Brussels.
"If the commission turns down this remedies package, then I think we would have to seriously consider exiting our 
investment in Aer Lingus, which without question would result in Aer Lingus being broken up," said Michael 
O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, at the company's annual meeting in Dublin.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had received bids for its 29.9 per cent stake in Aer Lingus from financial buyers. He would 
not give any further details of these approaches, except that some of them had been made within the last three 
months.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had submitted a draft remedies package to the commission, which involved getting other 
airlines to commit to take over 35 routes to Europe where the proposed takeover would result in a monopoly 
situation. Talks between Ryanair, Brussels and other airlines would continue until the end of October and he was 
hopeful of a decision on the bid before Christmas, he said.
"There is a compelling airline timing issue involved. If we could get approval before Christmas then it would enable 
the other airlines to come and take up the other routes in time for summer 2013," he said.
Ryanair confident of Aer Lingus approval
In 2007, the European Commission prohibited Ryanair's first takeover bid for Aer Lingus, noting that the combined 
entity would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or dominant position on 35 routes to and from 
Ireland. In July, Aer Lingus highlighted how the number of routes where it and Ryanair were the only operators had 
increased, from 22 in 2007 to 44 in 2012.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair's remedies package was "revolutionary" and went far beyond those accepted by the 
commission in previous airline transactions such as British Airways and British Midland.
He said Ryanair had won commitments from other airlines, who wanted to take up the routes, flights and traffic 
provided under the remedies package. But he said no formal commitments could be finalised before the talks with 
the commission were concluded.
Mr O'Leary refused to disclose the airlines involved in the talks but the Financial Times disclosed last month it had 
approached Air France-KLM, easyJet, Etihad Airways, Flybe, International Airlines Group and Virgin Atlantic.
Mr O'Leary said the discussion with the commission on Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus was being conducted in a more 
"rational and dispassionate" manner compared to its previous bids for the company.
"In 2007 there was much more government interference   they were determined to block it come hell or high water," 
he said.
He said Charlie McCreevey, a former European Commissioner who sits on the board of Ryanair, had not been 
involved in the talks because he felt this could have been a "hindrance".
"I remain confident that our revolutionary remedies package will win approval in Brussels and that we will be able to 
acquire in time and significantly grow Aer Lingus and have two decent-sized Irish airlines running around Europe 
kicking the crap out of the competition," said Mr O'Leary.

EasyJet is hoping to profit from the government's cost-cutting drive, striking a deal this week with the House of 
Commons' travel agency that will allow MPs and their staff to book journeys on the budget airline as easily as they 
do with the likes of British Airways.
While MPs travelling for work have always been able to buy tickets with low-cost carriers and expense them, this 
contract - which also covers the House of Lords - offers discounts on easyJet fares and greater flexibility to change 
booked journeys.
Andrew Burch at Hillgate Travel, which won the contract to run Parliament's travel office in 2009, said easyJet had 
approached Hillgate in search of big corporate clients looking to reduce travel costs. That the House of Commons 
signed on "just demonstrates they run their business as a business", he added.
It is not unusual for budget carriers to be left out of the equation when people book flights through a company travel 
agent, since few have contracts with the agents or the organisations. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, 
lashed out at Brussels this spring for using a flight-booking system that rules out budget airlines.
"This prohibition is a blatant subsidy to EU flag carriers and discriminates yet again against Europe's low-fares 
airlines," he said.
EasyJet has taken a more low-key approach to the problem, but it is keen to attract business customers, who tend 
to book higher fares closer to the date of travel.
EasyJet strikes travel deal with MPs
The company pointed out on Monday that it already counts many MPs as customers, including 80 it carried for free 
last summer, as they attempted to return quickly from holiday for an emergency session of the House of Commons 
following rioting that spread across the country.

Lufthansa cabin crew are set to broaden strike action on Friday causing the cancellation of more than 1,000 flights 
and threatening the German airline with further costly disruption.
The Independent Flight Attendants' Organisation (UFO) has urged cabin crew to strike for 24 hours from midnight 
on Thursday at Lufthansa bases across Germany.
The third day of industrial action comes as neither Lufthansa nor the union showed signs of backing down in their 
dispute over pay and working conditions.
The airline took out newspaper advertisements on Thursday warning customers of the "massive impact" on its 
schedule after saying it would cancel about two-thirds of the 1,800 flights due on Friday.
Christoph Franz, chief executive, and other board members apologised for the disruption and reiterated that they 
viewed the strike as "disproportionate".
"[The strike] inflicts a high financial cost on the company and harms the reputation of the Lufthansa brand," he said 
in the letter, urging the union to return to the negotiating table.
The union said in a statement that it regretted the escalation "but the negotiations have come to a point where there 
is no alternative to a strike".
Lufthansa, Europe's largest airline by revenues, plans to eliminate 3,500 posts as it aims to reduce costs by at least 
EUR1.5bn through restructuring.
Lufthansa crews escalate strike action
High fuel costs have added to years of fierce competition from no-frills European rivals such as Ryanair as well as 
premium Middle East carriers.
The strike action follows 13 months of inconclusive talks over pay and comes amid union fears about the 
outsourcing of jobs to low-cost airlines and greater use of temporary staff.
The first stoppages began last Friday at Frankfurt airport, then spread to Berlin and Munich on Tuesday forcing 
about 350 cancellations, mainly short- and medium-haul flights.
On Friday strike action is set to affect the whole of Lufthansa's network of German airports and extend to lucrative 
long-haul destinations such as Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro and Hong Kong.
Andrew Lobbenberg at HSBC told clients that the escalation of strike action would probably prompt the company "to 
investigate legal options, looking to challenge the proportionality of the response to the scale of the disagreement 
between the parties. Alternatively the escalation could force moves towards an arbitrated solution".
Peter Oppitzhauser at Cheuvreux estimated the three days of strike action would cost Lufthansa up to EUR29m, or 
about 5 per cent of the EUR533m consensus forecast for Lufthansa's 2012 operating profit.
However, he added: "Labour costs are basically the only cost lever that Lufthansa is able to pull so I expect the 
airline will continue to hold the line unless costs from the strike rise significantly."
Lufthansa made a EUR20m operating loss in the first half of the year, although the second quarter was profitable.
The airline has published a list of cancelled flights on its website. Passengers are being rebooked on alternative 
flights or offered a refund. Lufthansa subsidiaries such as Austrian Airlines, Swiss and Germanwings are not 
affected.

David Cameron said he will make an announcement on airports in the next few days, after a reshuffle raised 
expectations of a U-turn on Heathrow expansion.
The prime minister said he hoped to have cross-party support to address the problem of the hub status of the UK.
But he said this would not mean breaking the Conservative party's promise not to allow Heathrow expansion during 
this parliament.
"While I do believe in the need to establish a form of review which can bring parties together to make the decision, I 
will not be breaking my manifesto pledge," he said in response to a question at prime minister's question time on 
Wednesday.
Earlier, Grant Shapps, the new Conservative party co-chairman, said the government must look at "all the options" 
for increasing airport capacity in the south-east of England.
The shake-up gave more rightwing Conservatives posts in government and cleared the way for a change in policy 
on a third runway at Heathrow by replacing outspoken opponent Justine Greening as transport secretary.
Mr Shapps told the BBC's Today programme: "If we are going to remain one of the great trading nations we need 
ports and in particular, airports. The lack of slots in the south-east around London must be addressed otherwise 
we're dooming ourselves to economic failure in the future."
PM seeks cross-party support on airports
But he stressed that the Conservatives had not abandoned their promise to be the greenest government ever, after 
the appointment of Owen Paterson, who has campaigned against wind farms and in favour of fast-tracking 
exploitation of shale gas, as environment secretary.
On a visit on Wednesday morning, Nick Clegg, deputy prime minister, said a third runway "will not happen" under 
the coalition.
The Conservatives will also face opposition to a Heathrow U-turn from within their own ranks - not least from Boris 
Johnson, the mayor of London, who has strongly criticised any plans for expansion at the west London airport.
Mr Johnson said on Wednesday morning that expansion was "a profound mistake" that would do "massive 
environmental damage" in west London and across the capital.
Zach Goldsmith, the Conservative MP whose west London constituency would be affected, accused the 
government of not being "clear and straight with the voter".
He told the Today programme that Heathrow had been ruled out at every stage of the consultations on airport 
capacity, yet it was "impossible to pretend" the reshuffle did not raise the possibility of a change of policy on a third 
runway.
Mr Goldsmith reiterated his threat to trigger a by-election if the government did perform a U-turn on the airport's 
expansion.
Expanding Stansted airport is among the myriad other options also being considered. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's 
chief executive, said on Tuesday he would push for a second runway at the airport "as soon as possible" if the 
budget airline was to take a stake in London's third largest airport.
After Mr Cameron brought more rightwing Conservatives into cabinet, Mr Clegg insisted the government "remains 
anchored in the centre ground".
"Right from day one this government was anchored in the centre ground. We've got a coalition agreement which is 
there, which is a tablet of stone setting out what we are going to do," he said. "That is not going to change."
But Tim Farron, Lib Dem president, said that if the prime minister had shifted to the right in the reshuffle, that was a 
result of his weakness.
"If he has tacked to the right this time round, then it is proof that his claim to the centre ground has evaporated and 
that is bad news for the Tory party," he told BBC news.
Rob Wilson, a Tory backbencher, said the reshuffle was part of the process of divorce with the Lib Dems.
But Mr Shapps said the reshuffle was designed to put in a place a team which could deliver on the laws passed 
since the government came to power in 2010.
"The predecessor pack put policy in place, they got it off the board and in many cases legislated. This is the team 
for delivering on that and getting the economy moving," he said.

EasyJet to roll out allocated seating

EasyJet has decided to expand its summer experiment in allocated seating to the entire fleet from November, after 
determining that assigning passengers places did not add to costs but brought in more revenues than the old 
"speedy boarding" option.
The budget carrier started assigning seats on six routes in April, charging passengers who wanted to choose where 
they sat between £3 and £12. It later expanded the trial, eventually covering about 5 per cent of the carrier's 
network, always with a full roll-out in mind.
The risks of reversing what had become standard practice among low-cost carriers include slower turnaround 
times, which can hurt margins if an aircraft is therefore making fewer flights in a day. But easyJet said on 
Wednesday that there had been no impact on either those times or, more generally, punctuality.
It also found that the money raised from passengers paying for seats matched or exceeded that raised by the £9-
£16 speedy boarding option, which gives the people with those tickets first access to the aircraft. Speedy boarding 
will no longer be an option at the carrier, since assigning seats makes it redundant, easyJet said.
Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst with HSBC, saw the move as positive not just because it could boost the top line 
without hurting margins but because "it places more space between the easyJet and Ryanair business propositions, 
which is no bad thing".
He estimated it could appeal to families who want to sit together and business travellers irritated by the queuing that 
often goes hand-in-hand with open seating. EasyJet has been keen to attract business travellers, who tend to book 
closer to their journey times, when tickets are more expensive.
EasyJet to roll out allocated seating
The aspirations are not entirely uncontroversial: Sir Stelios Haji-Ionnau, easyJet's founder and still its biggest 
shareholder, this winter questioned whether business travellers really paid higher fares.
But judging from easyJet's research, the new policy should prove popular, given that passengers cited boarding as 
the least pleasant part of an easyJet journey.
While Ryanair reserves exit- and front-row seats - which have extra leg-room - to customers willing to pay more, it 
has said it has no plans to follow easyJet's path on aircraft-wide allocated seating. However other low-cost airlines 
such as Spain's Vueling and JetBlue in the US have already adopted that model.
Legacy airlines, meanwhile, are copying some of the budget carriers' practices, with increasing numbers offering 
goods and services such as extra legroom a la carte.
On Wednesday, Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet, said: "This is an example of easyJet trying to do all it 
can to make travel easy and affordable for our passengers."

As the businessman Lord Hanson once remarked when asked a thorny question about asset pricing and 
accounting niceties: "If you're trading a horse, it is the value to the buyer and what the seller can get for it". The 
same might be said about UK airports.
Ryanair, having publicly signalled that it would be a willing minority investor in Stansted airport - which BAA is being 
forced to sell by regulators - is making a valiant effort to talk down the price. It takes issue with use of the Civil 
Aviation Authority's "regulatory asset base" calculation, which threw up a £1.3bn figure earlier this year for 
Stansted, as a lazy proxy for the airport's value. Quite right, too. The RAB is not meant to be a sale valuation 
measure: rather, it reflects the historical cost of assets used in the business, indexed upwards for inflation. Any 
buyer is going to be every bit as interested in the property's earnings potential. And on that score, Ryanair points to 
the 27 per cent fall in passenger numbers passing through Stansted over the past five years. The decline reflects 
tighter holiday budgets, but also the decision of some carriers, including Ryanair, to shift business elsewhere.
Whether Ryanair will find partners that share its vision of restoring growth through airline-friendly, streamlined 
management of Stansted's facilities is less clear, although some travellers, at least, might wish it well. But 
institutional appetite for airport assets is far from sated and Edinburgh sold for over £800m in April. That equated to 
an enterprise value of almost 17 times 2011 earnings (before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation), 
according to the seller. Citibank reckons that similar multiples for other recent airport trade sales have been in the 
12.5-17 times range. Stansted's ebidta last year was £87m. Seller and potential buyers ought to start there.

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, would push for a second runway at Stansted "as soon as possible" if 
the budget carrier were to take a stake in London's third biggest airport.
Mr O'Leary has been talking to a number of groups about joining a bid for the facility, which operator BAA - owned 
by Spanish infrastructure company Ferrovial - is being forced to sell by UK competition authorities.
But he emphasised on Tuesday that Ryanair is interested in a long-term investment, in contrast to some of the 
private equity groups circling Stansted, who might be more reluctant to build a new runway despite planning 
permission having already been granted.
"Most of the potential bidders just want to make as much money as they can in the short term and then flip it on," he 
said on Tuesday. "We have a different vision...of a longer-term strategy of significantly lowering the costs of the 
airport, significantly lowering prices and then really driving traffic growth."
He added: "The more capacity at Stansted, the sooner it can grow."
Any consortium that included Ryanair would need to persuade the Civil Aviation Authority that the airline's holding 
did not represent a significant conflict of interest. For that reason Mr O'Leary said he would keep his potential stake 
below 25 per cent. But some industry experts think he could still run foul of regulators.
Mr O'Leary argued that expansion of Stansted was the best first step in a solution to the capital's airport capacity 
crunch. "The logical way to roll out the capacity is at the London airports....But aviation needs a national policy, and 
a national policy needs a government with a bit of backbone."
Ryanair eyes Stansted stake
He argued that the UK government should approve a second runway at Stansted, followed by a third runway at 
Heathrow, followed by a second runway at Gatwick.
Mr O'Leary said he expected the Stansted contest to be decided by the end of the year. UK regulators have 
assessed the value of the airport's facilities at £1.3bn, but most analysts expect the company to sell for significantly 
less than that.
Mr O'Leary predicted that it would go for "more than it's worth", but said that would not deflect him from taking part 
in a bid.

Lufthansa is braced for further costly disruption after cancelling almost 200 flights on Friday following a strike by 
cabin staff.
The stoppage affected 26,000 passengers, highlighting the challenge facing the German airline as it tries to bear 
down on overheads amid tough conditions for European carriers.
The eight-hour strike involved flights to and from Frankfurt airport, Germany's busiest and Lufthansa's main 
operating base. The stoppage was called at short notice by the union representing cabin crew following the 
breakdown of long-running pay talks.
The Independent Flight Attendants' Organisation has threatened similar stoppages in coming days at Frankfurt or 
other airports. At least 18,000 of Lufthansa's cabin staff are thought to be potentially involved in the dispute.
The escalation of the dispute with flight staff comes as Lufthansa, Europe's largest airline by revenues, aims to cut 
administrative jobs. It is pursuing plans to eliminate 3,500 posts as it aims to reduce costs by at least EUR1.5bn 
through restructuring.
High fuel costs have added to years of fierce competition from lower-cost rivals such as Ryanair for Lufthansa and 
other European airlines, which are also suffering from excess capacity despite continuing consolidation. Lufthansa 
posted an operating loss in the first half of the year, although the second quarter was profitable.
Strike forces Lufthansa to cancel flights
Lufthansa said the dispute - which follows 13 months of inconclusive talks over pay - was being "waged at the 
expense of its customers". Strikes at short notice make it more difficult for Lufthansa to make contingency 
arrangements, which the airline said was causing additional problems for passengers.
Peter Oppitzhauser, an analyst at Cheuvreux, said: "Lufthansa has such a heavy burden of fixed costs that labour 
costs are one of the few things the company can tweak if it wants to remain competitive. The dispute is not so much 
about the size of any pay rise but about the flexibility that Lufthansa wants to get from its workforce."
Lufthansa was "sounding tougher about its stance in this dispute than it has in the past", Mr Oppitzhauser said.
Friday's stoppage began at 5am and affected mainly short and medium-haul flights but a number of flights to the 
US were also hit. By late afternoon on Friday about 190 flights had been cancelled. Flights by Lufthansa's regional 
and Germanwings subsidiaries were not affected.
Other airlines using Frankfurt airport also suffered delays because of a shortage of parking spots because of 
grounded aircraft.

One of the most amusing aspects of Ryanair's opportunistic third attempt to buy Aer Lingus is how Michael O'Leary, 
chief executive of the Irish low-cost carrier, appears to have taken a vow of silence. Since unveiling the takeover 
proposal in June, the self-confessed "loudmouth" has been saying next to nothing about the bid.
This remarkable show of self-restraint seems part of a broader effort to woo the European Commission which, as 
antitrust regulator, is the main obstacle to Ryanair's bid succeeding. Mr O'Leary and the commission have a 
notoriously poor relationship - which predates Brussels' decision to block Ryanair's first bid for Aer Lingus, made in 
2006.
But even if Ryanair's verbal assaults on the commission have halted temporarily, Brussels should not approve its 
latest bid for Aer Lingus - because there remains a risk that a combined carrier could rip off consumers through 
higher fares (technically, Ryanair's EUR694m offer for Aer Lingus' equity lapsed on Wednesday, because the 
commission has embarked on an in-depth investigation, but the low-cost carrier plans to re-bid).
Indeed, the fact that Mr O'Leary is trying to consummate the deal at all suggests that he is focused on the wrong 
priorities.
There is no doubting his achievements at Ryanair. Since 1994, Mr O'Leary has turned a struggling Irish upstart 
airline into Europe's leading low-cost carrier by revenue and created the sector's fifth largest company by market 
value. In an industry dogged by poor profitability, Ryanair boasted an operating margin of 15.6 per cent in 2011-12 - 
putting it ahead of most other listed airlines.
O'Leary focusing on the wrong priorities
The industry's often wafer-thin margins are partly a result of there being far too many airlines. Consolidation in the 
US market has brought relief, with the remaining five large airlines having greater pricing power and therefore the 
ability to (moderately) raise fares.
However, this proposed takeover of Aer Lingus would leave Ryanair in far too strong a position in its home market, 
by combining Ireland's two main airlines. In 2007, the commission identified 35 routes from Dublin, Shannon and 
Cork airports where Ryanair and Aer Lingus had overlapping routes, potentially giving the combined entity a 
monopoly or dominant position. Aer Lingus claims the number of overlapping routes has increased since then.
The odds are therefore stacked against this deal succeeding. However, it is not hard to see why Mr O'Leary is 
having another go.
The failure of Ryanair's first two bids for Aer Lingus - the second offer, made in 2008, was withdrawn after 
objections by the Irish government - is the obvious blemish on Mr O'Leary's record.
His latest bid also appears opportunistic in its timing. It was launched just four days after the UK Competition 
Commission announced an investigation into Ryanair's 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus - a probe that could 
culminate in the low-cost carrier being forced to sell its shareholding. Ryanair is now arguing that the UK 
investigation should be halted while Brussels evaluates its proposed takeover of Aer Lingus.
A deal has not been formally opposed by the cash-strapped Irish government, which has a 25 per cent stake in Aer 
Lingus - but probably because it is committed to selling its shareholding in the airline under the terms of the 
country's bail out.
Mr O'Leary is certainly seizing on the European Commission's approval in March of the takeover of BMI British 
Midland by International Airlines Group (IAG), parent of British Airways. The transaction enabled the largest 
operator at London's Heathrow airport to own the second largest.
This ruling was a notable departure from the commission's practice of mainly approving mergers between airlines 
where two carriers had their principal operations in different airports (such as in the Air France/KLM transaction). 
However, lossmaking BMI would likely have collapsed had it not been bought by IAG. Aer Lingus, by contrast, is a 
profitable airline.
So how might Mr O'Leary's priorities be wrong?
Since 2010, the Ryanair story has switched from one of growth, via expansion of its all-Boeing fleet, to handing 
cash to shareholders. Mr O'Leary wants more growth but has been holding out for a cut-price aircraft order - which 
has been proving difficult, partly because Boeing has been slower than Airbus in finalising a new version of its 
narrow-body jet.
He would do well to focus the energy he has devoted to the pursuit of Aer Lingus on finalising an aircraft order.

Japan Airlines has set a tight pricing range for its initial public offering, in an indication of strong demand among 
investors for the state-backed flag-carrier that tumbled into bankruptcy two years ago.
On Thursday JAL said it would offer shares at between Y3,500 and Y3,790, raising up to Y663bn ($8.4bn) in what 
should rank as the world's second-largest IPO this year, after Facebook.
The narrow pricing range - about half the typical spread for the biggest Japanese deals, according to Dealogic - 
suggests that underwriters are confident of persuading investors to back the long-anticipated offer, even in a 
relatively weak equity market.
Under Kazuo Inamori, the founder of electronic company Kyocera, JAL has restructured its route network, 
rationalised its fleet of aircraft, cut staff, sold non-core assets and strengthened its balance sheet. In July it entered 
the low-cost carrier market through Jetstar Japan, a joint venture with Qantas of Australia and two other Japanese 
partners.
With an operating margin of 12.2 per cent in the year to March, it ranks as the most profitable flag-carrier in the 
world, according to Bloomberg data.
"It has been a significant turnround in the business," said Nicholas Cunningham, analyst at Macquarie Securities in 
Tokyo.
JAL to take off with $8.4bn share sale
At the top end of its indicative pricing range JAL would surpass All Nippon Airways as Japan's biggest carrier by 
market value, and would rank as the fourth largest worldwide, behind Latam Airlines Group, Singapore Airlines and 
Air China. At the lower end it would rank fifth, ahead of Ryanair, Delta and Cathay Pacific.
Either way, the Japanese government can be confident of making a significant return on the Y350bn it injected into 
JAL in early 2010. All 175m shares are being sold by JAL's parent, the state-owned Enterprise Turnaround Initiative 
Corp.
At the midpoint of the range, the offer values JAL at just over five times forecast earnings in the year to March 2013. 
However, under existing laws JAL will likely pay no corporate tax until 2019, thanks to credits earned against 
writedowns. If investors were to apply a standard corporate tax rate to those earnings, JAL's forward price/earnings 
ratio moves to about 8 times, a slight discount to the global aviation sector.
Japan's equity market, the world's second biggest by capitalisation of listed companies, has been lacklustre in 
terms of new issuance, with a total of $1.7bn raised so far this year. That compares with $15bn in Shanghai, $5.5bn 
in Hong Kong and $2.1bn in Singapore.
Underwriters led by Daiwa Securities aim to sell about three-quarters of the shares to Japanese investors. The vast 
majority of those will go to retail investors, according to a person familiar with the plans.
A one-week bookbuilding process begins on Friday. The final price is due to be set on September 10, with trading 
set to start on September 19.

Michael O'Leary, boss of Ryanair, has built up an airline that operates with commendable efficiency. The same 
cannot be said for his acquisition strategy. The latest round in Ryanair's five-year pursuit of Aer Lingus is looking 
increasingly like a waste of time and effort for both bidder and target.
On Wednesday, European Union competition officials opened an in-depth inquiry into the low-cost carrier's June bid 
for its Irish rival. But their accompanying words made the EUR700m offer's chances of overcoming antitrust 
obstacles appear ever more slender. On a "large number of European routes, mainly out of Ireland", the two 
carriers are each other's closest - and often only - competitors, they noted. Barriers to entry "appear to be high". 
And since 2007, when Brussels first rebuffed the proposed Irish tie-up, the number of routes which both carriers 
operate has increased, they also observed. Aer Lingus puts the figure at about 50.
Of course, it is possible that Mr O'Leary may yet cobble together a clutch of rival carriers willing to take on large 
parts of Aer Lingus' route network. But lobbing in an offer and then scouring for solutions to endemic monopoly 
problems is hardly the best modus operandi - and his efforts do not appear to be making much progress. Those 
who always suspected Ryanair's offer was a ploy to trump a UK inquiry into whether it should have to dispose of its 
29.9 per cent Aer Lingus stake look increasingly justified.
On purely financial grounds, investors in Ryanair may not care too much: the carrier's 29.9 per cent Aer Lingus 
stake, which cost EUR407m, has already been written down to about EUR80m. But the bid antics will mean months 
of legal fees and management distraction for both carriers. That might be indulged in boom times. In an age of 
austerity, it is an extravagance that needs to end.

The European Commission on Wednesday announced an in-depth investigation into Ryanair's third proposed 
takeover of Aer Lingus, after an initial inquiry concluded the transaction could harm competition.
The Commission, acting as antitrust regulator, prohibited Ryanair's first bid for Aer Lingus in 2007 because of 
competition concerns. Its investigation into the latest offer will last until next year.
"The Commission's preliminary investigation into the proposed takeover . . . indicated potential competition 
concerns," said the Commission.
"On a large number of European routes, mainly out of Ireland, the two airlines are each other's closest competitors 
and barriers to entry appear to be high."
Dublin-based Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, in June made an offer of EUR1.30 per Aer Lingus share, 
valuing the Irish flag carrier's equity at EUR694m. Under takeover rules, the offer lapsed on Wednesday because of 
the Commission's investigation.
But Ryanair said it "intends to re-bid for Aer Lingus if the European Commission clears its offer following its [in-
depth investigation]".
Aer Lingus, which opposed the bid, highlighted how the number of routes out of Ireland jointly operated by it and 
Ryanair had increased from 35 in 2007 to 50 today.
"The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger than before," added Aer Lingus.
Brussels probes Ryanair 's Aer Lingus bid
The Aer Lingus board has previously told investors that Ryanair's offer undervalued the company.
Ryanair's chances of succeeding with its offer hinge mainly on whether it can secure regulatory approval in 
Brussels rather than shareholder support.
In 2007, the Commission concluded that Ryanair's offer to relinquish take-off and landing slots at Dublin airport was 
an inadequate remedy to ensure competition, because Brussels concluded rival airlines were unlikely to step in and 
provide alternative services.
Ryanair has approached at least six airlines - Air France-KLM, easyJet, Etihad Airways, Flybe, International Airlines 
Group and Virgin Atlantic - asking them to consider providing services on some of the routes jointly operated by it 
and Aer Lingus.
However, in a sign that Ryanair may find it difficult to obtain regulatory clearance, some of these six airlines have 
limited or no interest in providing services out of Ireland.
The strongest interest, from IAG and Virgin, is to use Aer Lingus' slots at London's Heathrow airport for services to 
Dublin, but they do not want to operate Irish routes to other European destinations.
Ryanair's second offer for Aer Lingus, made in 2008, was withdrawn after objections by the Irish government, which 
has a 25 per cent stake in the carrier.
The government has expressed concerns but not opposed the latest offer, in a pragmatic stance that may reflect 
how it plans to sell its Aer Lingus stake under the terms of Ireland's bailout.

The European Commission on Wednesday announced an in-depth investigation into Ryanair's third proposed 
takeover of Aer Lingus, after an initial inquiry concluded the transaction could harm competition.
Acting as antitrust regulator, the commission in 2007 prohibited Ryanair's first bid for Aer Lingus amid competition 
concerns. Lawyers said the low-cost carrier's latest offer would probably struggle to gain approval in Brussels.
"The commission's preliminary investigation into the proposed takeover . . . indicated potential competition 
concerns," said the regulator. "On a large number of European routes, mainly out of Ireland, the two airlines are 
each other's closest competitors and barriers to entry appear to be high."
Dublin-based Ryanair in June made an offer of EUR1.30 per Aer Lingus share, valuing the Irish flag carrier's equity 
at EUR694m. Under takeover rules, the offer lapsed on Wednesday because of the commission's investigation, 
which will run into the new year.
But Ryanair said it "intends to re-bid for Aer Lingus if the European Commission clears its offer following its [in-
depth investigation]".
Aer Lingus, which opposes the bid, said the number of routes out of Ireland where it overlaps with Ryanair had 
increased from 35 in 2007 to 50 today. It added: "The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger than 
before."
EU to probe Ryanair 's tilt at Aer Lingus
The Aer Lingus board had previously told investors that Ryanair's offer undervalued the company. Ryanair's 
chances of succeeding hinge mainly on whether it can secure regulatory approval in Brussels rather than 
shareholder support.
In 2007, the commission concluded that Ryanair's offer to relinquish take-off and landing slots at Dublin airport was 
an inadequate remedy to ensure competition because rival airlines were unlikely to step in and provide other 
services.
Ryanair has approached at least six airlines - Air France-KLM, easyJet, Etihad Airways, Flybe, International Airlines 
Group and Virgin Atlantic - asking them to consider providing services on some of the routes it operates jointly with 
Aer Lingus. However, several of these six airlines have limited or no interest in providing services out of Ireland.
Commission officials said they would consider any remedy proposals from Ryanair, but stressed that the low-cost 
carrier had done little to prove that a merger with Aer Lingus would not hurt competition.
Bruce Kilpatrick, competition lawyer at Addleshaw Goddard, said: "Unless Ryanair can show that market conditions 
have changed in its favour - and it is far from clear that they have - then it is likely to face an uphill struggle to 
persuade the Commission to approve the deal."

Ryanair is seeking regulatory approval for its proposed takeover of Aer Lingus by asking at least six airlines to 
operate alternative services on some of the Irish flag carrier's routes.
Ryanair has approached Air France-KLM, easyJet, Etihad Airways, Flybe, International Airlines Group and Virgin 
Atlantic, asking them to consider providing competition on routes to and from Dublin where the two Irish carriers are 
the leading or only providers.
However, in a sign that Ryanair could find it difficult to secure regulatory approval because its proposed Aer Lingus 
takeover risks a substantial reduction in competition, some of these six airlines have expressed limited or no 
interest in operating services to Ireland.
Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost carrier, declined to comment, together with the six airlines it has approached.
On Wednesday, the European Commission is expected to launch an in-depth investigation into what is Ryanair's 
third offer for Aer Lingus, five years after prohibiting its first bid.
Brussels raised concerns in 2007 at how, following Ryanair's proposed takeover of Aer Lingus, the combined entity 
would have a monopoly or dominant position on 35 routes out of Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports that went to 
European destinations ranging from Alicante to Warsaw.
It concluded Ryanair's offer to relinquish airport take-off and landing slots, to facilitate competition on these 35 
routes, was inadequate because no rival airlines appeared likely to operate alternative services.
Ryanair courts competition in Aer Lingus bid
Ryanair, which has a 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, is seeking to avoid a repetition of the commission's 2007 
objections by demonstrating other airlines would operate routes where the two Irish carriers have overlapping 
services.
British Airways, the UK subsidiary of IAG, and Virgin Atlantic, were interested in the possibility of using Aer Lingus' 
slots at London's Heathrow airport to provide services to Dublin, said people familiar with the situation.
However, these people said BA and Virgin were not interested in running services from Ireland to other European 
destinations.
Flybe could be willing to operate some routes where Ryanair and Aer Lingus overlap, but easyJet is not, said 
people close to the companies.
Air France-KLM and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad are also not believed to be interested in operating on Ryanair's or Aer 
Lingus' routes.
Etihad has a 3 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, and is backing the flag carrier's management by rejecting Ryanair's bid.
Ryanair in June offered EUR1.30 per Aer Lingus share, valuing the carrier's equity at EUR694m, and some 
investors said the bid must be improved.
One top 20 Aer Lingus shareholder said: "We would like to see more money on the table from Ryanair before we 
give the deal our blessing."
A spokesman for the Irish government, which has a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, said it was evaluating 
Ryanair's bid and could not comment further.
The government's subdued approach is driven by the need to sell its Aer Lingus stake to help cut Ireland's budget 
deficit.

Aer Lingus on Friday repeated its advice to shareholders that they should reject Ryanair's latest bid for the Irish flag 
carrier.
With the European Commission due to rule on Ryanair's bid on Wednesday, Aer Lingus predicted Brussels would 
block the proposed takeover on competition grounds, and advised its investors to take "no action" on the offer.
Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost carrier, in June launched what is its third bid for Aer Lingus, offering EUR694m 
for the flag carrier's equity, or EUR1.3 per share.
Aer Lingus, which counts Ryanair as its largest shareholder, with a 29.8 per cent stake, said: "The board remains of 
the view that Ryanair's offer is not in the interests of shareholders, fundamentally undervalues the business and, 
due to the scale and extent of the competition issues, is likely once more to be prohibited by the European 
Commission.
"Accordingly, the board unanimously recommends shareholders take no action in relation to the offer."
Aer Lingus noted that Ryanair had not published any remedies to deal with competition concerns associated with 
the bid.
In 2007, the European Commission prohibited Ryanair's first takeover bid for Aer Lingus, noting that the combined 
entity would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or dominant position on 35 routes to and from 
Ireland.
Aer Lingus urges 'no action' on Ryanair
In July, Aer Lingus highlighted how the number of routes where the Irish flag carrier and Ryanair are the only 
operators had increased significantly, from 22 in 2007 to 44 in 2012.
Aer Lingus on Friday claimed Ryanair's offer undervalued the airline on several measures, and insisted it was a 
strong, standalone company.
It highlighted its previous financial guidance for 2012, under which Aer Lingus is seeking to at least match its 2011 
operating profit of EUR49.1m before exceptional items.
Ryanair's declared rationale for the bid is the creation of one strong Irish airline group, capable of competing with 
Air France-KLM, easyJet, Lufthansa, and International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, on Wednesday said he expected the European Commission to initiate a 
so-called phase two investigation into the company's bid for Aer Lingus.
The commission is conducting a phase one inquiry, which is due to conclude on August 29, and a follow-on 
investigation could last into next year.
Ryanair is not expected to publish proposed competition remedies until during the phase two investigation.

Twitter, Facebook, viral videos ... new ways of spreading the word are becoming more important to luxury brands, 
but the traditional print and poster campaign is still a critical vehicle for conveying a label's core message for the 
new season. "You don't need to compare classic ad campaigns with social media but instead discover how they 
can work effectively together to create the best brand message," says Emma Hill, creative director at Mulberry.
Michael Kors remarks: "Methods of print advertising are still very important today, but we also share our ad images 
in outdoor settings, as well as on digital, mobile and social media platforms." Since campaigns are seen by more 
people than ever, the pressure is on to make them powerful. But which brands are succeeding?
1. Moncler
Disregarding the advice that you should never work with animals, this Moncler model has bravely posed with a 
couple of polar bears - or at least models in furry costumes. It's cute, but what is it saying? Hang loose in Moncler's 
feather down jackets without getting frostbite? Switch off that ice-cap-melting central heating and reach for a puffer 
jacket? Remo Ruffini, chairman and creative director of Moncler, explains: "The latest campaign supports the non-
profit organisation Green Chimneys, a leader in animal-assisted therapy for kids that also provides care for animals 
and nature." Practical, philanthropic puffers - that's the message.
2. Louis Vuitton
Given Louis Vuitton's core as a luggage company, this vision of luxury travel, shot by Steven Meisel, is as on-brand 
as it gets. An appealing message: buy a Vuitton bag and step back to a pre-Ryanair golden age of travel. Don't tell 
me those models have decanted all the liquids inside their "it" hand luggage into clear plastic bags for security. It 
Power to the picture
certainly hasn't been done on the cheap - the train was specially built for the Paris catwalk show in March, then 
replicated in a New York studio - but they can probably afford it. In July, the Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy group 
reported a 28 per cent jump in net income to EUR1.7bn for the first half of 2012.
3. Alexander McQueen
Shot by David Sims, the McQueen campaign has been designed to showcase the artistry and imagination of the 
label's dresses, its unique selling point. The ads run over a spread with a black-and-white close-up of a dress on 
one side and a full-length in colour on the other. The sharp origami shape on which the model stands, combined 
with her minimal make-up and bleached-out hair, highlight the extravagant and organic fantasy of the dresses. One 
resembles a rose made of pink mille feuille silk, the other a feathery puffball. You would never guess that the 
collection was inspired by mushrooms.
4. Pucci
Given the amount of whimsy and nostalgia around this season, it's good to see a sultry ad from Pucci. For the 
brand's first ever campaign they've summed up the house's DNA (prints, sex, heritage, Italy) with a patterned-silk 
clad Amber Valletta sprawled on a couch and a hint of noir via moody lighting. Subtle? No. Seductive? Yes.
5. Mulberry
Fashion is fun. That's the message behind Mulberry's campaigns. The monsters that inspired the catwalk show 
appear in this season's campaign, which depicts the doll-like model Lindsey Wixson in a fairytale forest clutching 
Mulberry's latest arm candy, and surrounded by giant furry creatures. They seem friendly, but for how long, since 
Wixson is wearing a series of shaggy coats that look like monster fur? Emma Hill says the ad "plays on the 
romance and darkness of children's fairytales, with mysterious creatures and the idea of travel, fantasy and beauty. 
The icing on the cake is Tim Walker shooting the campaign; he creates a strong, rich narrative and the right mix of 
charm, romance and darkness." It's playful on the surface, while stirring subconscious fears, memories and desires 
- not least the urge to rush out and buy a new handbag.
6. Lanvin
"It's all about individuals with individuality," Alber Elbaz has said of the new Lanvin fashion campaign, which uses 
"real" people or, as the rest of the "real" world knows them, people who aren't models. It's a smart approach: not 
only are street-style blogs attracting as much interest as the catwalk, but when globalisation threatens uniqueness, 
a sense of character is appealing. Lanvin's image is of a brand that caters to women of different ages and sizes (ie 
not just size zero) and these characters - aged 18 to 81 and found through a street casting in New York - capitalise 
on that. A video of the shoot was released this week, in which the hitherto anonymous models reveal quirky 
elements of their personalities.
7. Michael Kors
A fur-trimmed wool coat and chunky jumper worn with sunglasses on a bright LA day? This isn't Michael Kors' 
suggestion on how to regulate your body temperature this autumn, but his manifesto for glamour. Kors says of the 
campaign, shot by Mario Testino, that it "fuses together two of my most cherished themes: jetset style and 
Hollywood glamour. The images draw inspiration from the backlots of golden-age Hollywood.
"The contrast of them [models Karmen Pedaru and Simon Nessman] being both youthful and sophisticated, super-
glamorous and approachable, all at the same time is very Michael Kors," says Kors, whose tight brand image 
helped him launch the biggest-ever initial public offering in US fashion last December. This campaign sticks to the 
script as religiously as an eager-to-please starlet.
8. Miu Miu
Fashion's David Bowie moment continues this season, thanks to the Miu Miu campaign. Cross Bowie with a cord-
wearing university lecturer and a garish suburban sofa, all from the 1970s, and you've got the look. It takes a brave 
Power to the picture
soul to wear so much clashing print - although indie actress Chloë Sevigny, who also appeared in a Miu Miu 
campaign in 1996, might plausibly do so - but then this ad broadcasts that Miu Miu is all about determinedly offbeat 
dressing and taking risks. There's not much mise-en-scène, just a shag-pile carpet and a modernist chair, because 
this isn't a lifestyle brand like Armani or Michael Kors. Designer Miuccia Prada is about pure fashion for fashion's 
sake.

Britain will be losing one of its most colourful chief executives with Sir Brian Souter's relinquishment of the top 
management role at Stagecoach.
He has combined entrepreneurial flair with outspoken views while running Stagecoach and he may be missed as 
much for his casual dress as his record in creating one of the world's biggest bus and train operators.
But Sir Brian is not leaving Stagecoach - he intends to move from chief executive to chairman in May next year - 
and this is causing nervousness among some investors who fear he might disrupt his successor.
In an email to staff on Wednesday, Sir Brian, 58, said: "Now is the right time for me to take a step back from the 
day-to-day management of the business. Stagecoach is in excellent shape and it has always been my intention to 
pass the baton well before retirement."
With only two buses, Sir Brian co-founded Stagecoach in 1980 with his sister Ann Gloag. Today, it is the UK's 
largest listed bus and train operator by market capitalisation.
The company achieved its status by riding the wave of deregulation in the bus and rail industries during the 1980s 
and 1990s - and it was not afraid to use aggressive tactics against competitors. For example, Stagecoach 
sometimes ran free buses that arrived slightly in advance of rivals' services.
But above all, Stagecoach has been entrepreneurial. Sir Brian, who paid his way through university by working as a 
bus conductor, considers one of his most substantial achievements to be megabus.com - Stagecoach's no-frills, 
low-cost, long-distance bus service that he likens to Ryanair.
Stagecoach charts course for succession
That willingness to take risks with new services and acquisitions has mostly led to a solid financial performance - 
certainly in recent years. In the year to April 30, Stagecoach reported pre-tax profit of £239.8m, up 14.4 per cent 
compared to 2010-11.
The one notable blemish in the Stagecoach story was its disastrous acquisition of Coach USA, a sprawling north 
American bus, coach and taxi operator, in 1999.
The challenge of sorting out the American business prompted Sir Brian to take the role of chief executive in 2002 - 
he had been chairman since 1998.
Sir Brian's successor as chief executive will be Martin Griffiths, currently Stagecoach's finance director, who joined 
the company in 1998 and like Sir Brian is a chartered accountant.
Mr Griffiths faces several challenges, including the turnround of Stagecoach's London bus business and has to 
decide how the company should respond to its joint venture with Virgin group, called Virgin Rail, losing the West 
Coast train franchise.
But could Mr Griffiths' biggest challenge be dealing with Sir Brian? As well as chairman, Sir Brian is the company's 
largest shareholder with a 15 per cent stake.
Some other shareholders in Stagecoach were critical of Sir Brian's move to chairman because of worries it could 
undermine the freedom of Mr Griffiths to draw up new plans.
One top 30 investor said: "My main concern is that Sir Brian will still try and run the company, when he should be 
standing back more. That could hinder the new chief executive."
Other shareholders were more relaxed, however, saying Sir Brian was "highly regarded" and would make a good 
chairman.
Although the UK corporate governance code states a chief executive should not become chairman of the same 
company, these shareholders highlighted how the guidance is not mandatory. Groups are supposed to explain their 
reasons for not complying with the code - as Stagecoach has done.
One top 20 investor said: "We are sure Sir Brian will act in the best interests of the company and the shareholders."
A Stagecoach spokesman declined to say whether Sir Brian would have an executive or non-executive role as 
chairman, or specify how much time he would devote to the new job.
Sir Brian said in his email he would remain "heavily involved" in Stagecoach as chairman but stressed Mr Griffiths 
had a "strong personality".
"Martin and I have been a team for around a decade and we will continue to work closely together," he added. "I'm 
confident he will be an excellent chief executive."

Heineken was among the biggest losers on the FTSE Eurofirst 300 on Wednesday morning after announcing 
disappointing first-half figures.
Earnings before interest and taxes rose 4.3 per cent year on year to EUR1.16bn on the back of acquisitions and 
currency gains. In the key western European market, volumes fell 2.9 per cent. The report comes as the Dutch 
brewer seeks to secure a further share in Asia Pacific Breweries, the maker of Tiger beer.
Shares in Heineken dropped 2.8 per cent to EUR43.28 against gains of 1.5 per cent in the previous session.
Ryanair added 1 per cent to EUR4.25 after the company said it may bid for a 25 per cent stake in the UK's Stansted 
airport, where the airline is the biggest customer.
Financial stocks dominated the leader board on the FTSE Eurofirst 300. Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo gained 2.9 per cent 
to EUR1.28 and UniCredit rallied 1.3 per cent to EUR3.30. AXA, the French insurer, rose 1.2 per cent to EUR11.92 
and UBS climbed 1 per cent to SFr10.96.
Schneider Electric was one of the biggest losers on the Paris exchange, dropping 2.3 per cent to EUR50.79. The 
French industrial bellwether is vulnerable to fluctuations in the global construction sector and the US architecture 
billings index reached 48.7 in July, still below the 50 mark signifying falling demand for architects.
More widely, activity remained subdued amid the holiday season. Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at 
Interactive Investor, said: "We're not expecting any real volumes in the market till next month when [Mario] Draghi

unveils his proposals. For now, on thin volumes, we're looking at corporate earnings to stimulate investor appetite 
this week. It's a very difficult trading environment with a lot of clients wanting to wait and see."
Markets fell with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 down 0.9 per cent to 1,099.41, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX down 0.9 per cent to 
7,025.39 and Spain's Ibex shedding 1.4 per cent to 7,436.4.

Shares in Heineken dropped 1.1 per cent to EUR44.00 on Wednesday, on the back of disappointing first-half 
figures. The stock had gained 1.5 per cent in the previous session.
Earnings before interest and taxes rose 4.3 per cent year on year to EUR1.16bn buoyed by acquisitions and 
currency gains. But in the key western European market, volumes fell 2.9 per cent. The results come as the Dutch 
brewer seeks to conclude a tumultuous bidding war for a further share in Asia Pacific Breweries, the maker of Tiger 
beer.
Ryanair added 1 per cent to EUR4.25 after the company said it may bid for a 25 per cent stake in the UK's Stansted 
airport, where the airline is the biggest customer.
Shares in Swiss staffing group, Adecco, lost 1.8 per cent to SFr44.06. Andrew Brooke, an analyst at RBC Capital 
Markets, on Wednesday chose the stock as a "top pick" cyclical investment: "We believe it can grow earnings per 
share in relatively muted economies, mix is improving, the balance sheet is strong and cost and capital discipline 
are second to none   the dividend payout ratio of 40-50 per cent and the ongoing EUR400m buyback underlines 
management's commitment to shareholders."
Fresenius, the dialysis company, dragged German markets lower. Shares dropped 2.9 per cent to EUR85.40 after 
rumours emerged that the supervisory board is considering a fresh takeover bid from rival Rhoen-Klinikum.
Spanish names littered the list of losers on the FTSE Eurofirst 300. Repsol , the oil and gas company, fell 5.3 per 
cent to EUR14.45, ACS lost 5.1 per cent to EUR14.94  and power utility Iberdrola dropped 4.0 per cent to EUR3.20.

Ryanair is considering bidding for a 25 per cent stake in Stansted airport in the UK, in a move that would see the 
low cost airline take its first step into airport ownership.
The company, which is Stansted's biggest customer, has already held talks with five or six consortiums about 
joining a bid for the Essex airport. The move by Ryanair comes as BAA agreed on Monday to sell the airport 
following a three-year battle with the competition commission in the UK.
Ryanair welcomed the decision to sell the airport, which is the fourth biggest by passenger numbers in the UK and 
which analysts say could cost up to £1bn.
"We are still interested in taking a stake in the airport. We have a long-term strategy for Stansted, which offers 
potential for growth," said Stephen McNamara, head of communications at Ryanair.
"The sale of Stansted into separate ownership will lead to more competition, lower passenger charges, improved 
passenger services and the roll out of additional and much needed traffic growth at competitive prices at Stansted," 
he said.
Several parties are understood to be interested in bidding, including pension funds, infrastructure funds and trade 
buyers such as Manchester Airports Group, which would fund a deal by selling off a third of its own equity.
Ryanair first revealed its interest last month when Howard Millar, Ryanair's chief financial officer, told journalists it 
was prepared to make a "modest commitment" as "anchor tenant" at Stansted.
Ryanair considers purchase of Stansted
"Stansted is the only place in London where another runway can be built," said Mr Millar. "It makes more sense to 
have it at Heathrow, but Stansted is the only place with capacity and we want a 25 per cent stake."
By taking an equity stake in Stansted Ryanair would be able to influence the development of the airport as a low 
cost hub. Partners of Ryanair in any bid would be able to guarantee the future commitment of the no-frills airline to 
the airport.
Regulated airports such as Stansted are rare prizes and appeal to investors looking for safe, inflation-pegged 
returns. The risk in these deals usually lies in the capital structure, since the multibillion-pound purchases are often 
highly leveraged.
Serving 17.5m passengers a year, Stansted is the third biggest airport in the capacity-constrained south-east of 
England. However, its numbers are a quarter lower than five years ago, as the recession has caused a dip in 
leisure travel.

Industry experts expect the sale of  London Stansted to be the first of several airport disposals by BAA over the 
next few years as the company that spent decades running an empire of complementary facilities now considers 
the merits of focusing solely on Heathrow.
Because the UK's biggest airport by passengers represents more than 90 per cent of BAA's revenues, losing 
Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton airports would not change the group's financial profile significantly. 
Meanwhile, "with Gatwick and Stansted both sold, it becomes more difficult to see the economic logic of keeping 
the others attached to it", says Colin Smith, head of airports at PwC.
That is not to say the airports are lacking in individual appeal. Aberdeen Airport is the best performing regional 
asset in BAA's portfolio thanks to its links to the oil and gas industry. But it could see returns fall off as North Sea oil 
goes into decline. Glasgow, meanwhile, could benefit from next year's Commonwealth Games but also faces newly 
vigorous competition from an Edinburgh Airport now under separate ownership.
Mr Smith thinks the smaller airports would attract a different breed of investor than those weighing a Stansted bid. 
London's third biggest airport is drawing interest from banks in search of inflation-pegged returns, from other 
airports and even from its biggest customer, Ryanair, which has expressed interest in a 25 per cent stake.
Smaller, unregulated airports offer greater risk and greater reward. Aberdeen could attract private equity, say 
analysts, while Glasgow and Southampton would likely catch the eye of infrastructure funds.
WAITING ON QUOTE APPROVAL
Manish Gupta, a partner at Ernst & Young, estimates the mid-sized airports could fetch between 12 and 15 times 
earnings. "The question BAA will ask is whether this is the right market to sell in or whether to wait another few 
years?" he said.
Chris Peaker at KPMG agrees: "They would rather keep these than sell for a price that would undervalue their 
assets."
The group might also spin off its regional airports rather than sell them piecemeal, giving current investors a chance 
to remain exposed to the regional market if they liked.
BAA says it has no plans to downsize further. "We haven't voluntarily sold any airports," a spokesman pointed out 
on Tuesday.

BAA has agreed to sell Stansted airport after three years of battling a Competition Commission order for its 
disposal.
A sale will leave the company that once owned London's three biggest airports with just Heathrow and a handful of 
regional facilities, including Glasgow. The operator, an arm of Ferrovial, the Spanish infrastructure group, had 
hoped to cling on to the capital's third-biggest airport by passenger numbers and had fought numerous appeals.
"We still believe that the ruling fails to recognise that Stansted and Heathrow serve different markets," said BAA on 
Monday, but decided not to appeal against last month's Court of Appeal ruling which found otherwise. "[We are] 
now proceeding with the sale of Stansted airport."
Several parties are understood to be interested in bidding, including pension funds, infrastructure funds and trade 
buyers such as Manchester Airports Group, which would fund a deal by selling off a third of its own equity.
Regulated airports such as Stansted, which analysts say could fetch about £1bn, are a rare prize and appeal to 
investors looking for safe, inflation-pegged returns. The risk in these deals usually lies in the capital structure, since 
the multibillion-pound purchases are often highly leveraged.
Serving 17.5m passengers a year, Stansted is the UK's fourth-biggest airport and the third biggest in the capacity-
constrained south-east of England. However, its numbers are a quarter lower than five years ago, as the recession 
has caused a dip in leisure travel.
BAA gives up fight to retain Stansted
Stansted's biggest customer is Ryanair, which runs three out of four flights into and out of the airport and with whom 
BAA has a tortured relationship. Like its rivals, such as EasyJet, the low-cost carrier has moved routes elsewhere 
as airport charges have risen and argues that BAA "is damaging Stansted and harming consumers".
Fifteen other carriers also use the airport, which handles 205,000 tonnes of cargo a year.
BAA's other airports include Glasgow, Southampton and Aberdeen. In 2009, three years after Ferrovial bought the 
group, UK competition authorities found it wielded unfair market power in London and Scotland and ordered the 
disposal of Gatwick, Stansted and either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports.
* Ryanair had a setback on Monday in its fight to stop the Competition Commission from pursuing an investigation 
into the influence it might wield over Aer Lingus through a 30 per cent stake in the Irish flag-carrier. After dismissing 
the budget airline's appeal earlier this month, the Competition Appeal Tribunal has refused it permission to take the 
case to the Court of Appeal. Ryanair said it would instead appeal directly to the court.

BAA has agreed to sell Stansted airport after three years of battling a Competition Commission order for its 
disposal.
A sale will leave the company that once owned London's three biggest airports with just Heathrow and a handful of 
regional facilities, including Glasgow airport. The operator, an arm of Spanish infrastructure group Ferrovial, had 
hoped to cling on to the capital's third-biggest airport by passenger numbers and fought a half-dozen appeals as it 
tried to do so.
"We still believe that the ruling fails to recognise that Stansted and Heathrow serve different markets," said BAA on 
Monday, but decided not to appeal against last month's Court of Appeal ruling which found otherwise. "[We are] 
now proceeding with the sale of Stansted airport."
Analysts expect Stansted to fetch about £1bn, or 11 times last year's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (ebitda). Several parties are understood to be interested in bidding, including pension funds, 
infrastructure funds and trade buyers such as Manchester Airports Group, which would fund a deal by selling off a 
third of its own equity.
Regulated airports such as Stansted are a rare prize and appeal to investors looking for safe, inflation-pegged

BAA gives up fight to retain Stansted
Serving 17.5m passengers a year, Stansted is the UK's fourth-biggest airport and the third biggest in the capacity-
constrained south-east of England. However, its numbers are significantly lower than five years ago, dented by the 
recession-induced dip in leisure travel.
Stansted's biggest customer is Ryanair, which runs three out of four flights into and out of the airport and with whom 
BAA has a tortured relationship. The low-cost carrier has - together with rivals such as EasyJet - moved routes 
elsewhere as airport charges have risen and argues that BAA "is damaging Stansted and harming consumers".
Fifteen other carriers also use the airport, and the facility handles 205,000 tonnes of cargo a year.
BAA's other airports include Glasgow, Southampton and Aberdeen. Three years after Ferrovial bought the group, in 
2006, UK competition authorities found it wielded unfair market power in London and Scotland and ordered the 
disposal of Gatwick, Stansted and either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports.
By the time of the ruling, the company was close to unloading Gatwick for 10 times ebitda. This year it sold 
Edinburgh for almost 17 times last year's earnings.

Virgin Atlantic is embarking on a significant change to its business strategy by starting to operate short haul flights 
in the UK.
Some analysts expressed doubts about Virgin's decision to move beyond its long haul, point-to-point flights.
From March, Virgin will operate a service between its hub at London's Heathrow airport and Manchester, in what is 
supposed to be the first of several short haul routes.
Steve Ridgway, Virgin's chief executive, insisted the airline could operate profitable short haul routes, even though 
some of Europe's flag carriers are struggling to do so because of intense competition from low-cost carriers led by 
Ryanair and easyJet.
Virgin will use some of its existing take-off and landing slots at Heathrow and Manchester airports to provide its first 
short haul service.
It is hoping to expand its short haul routes by securing 12 pairs of Heathrow slots that International Airlines Group, 
parent of British Airways, is required by regulators to relinquish as part of its takeover of BMI British Midland.
"I think we will remain overwhelmingly a long haul operator," said Mr Ridgway. "We will try to build the best short 
haul network we can."
Virgin is hoping many of the passengers that use its short haul services will transfer on to its long distance flights at 
Heathrow.
Virgin enters short haul market
This so-called hub-and-spoke system, involving large numbers of transfer passengers, is used by flag carriers to try 
and fill their long-haul flights.
Virgin lost important transfer traffic when IAG bought BMI from Lufthansa in April. Before the takeover Virgin had a 
code-sharing agreement with BMI that provided Sir Richard Branson's airline with significant transfer traffic.
John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting, an aviation consultancy, said: "It is unlikely Virgin can deliver a 
profitable short-haul network, given the well-established positions of low-cost carriers.
"In terms of using short haul services to feed their Heathrow hub, Virgin lacks the scale of British Airways' network 
to be certain of success."
Virgin is appealing against the European Commission's decision to approve IAG's takeover of BMI, although British 
Airways has begun integrating Lufthansa's former UK subsidiary.
Mr Ridgway said Virgin was hoping to secure the 12 pairs of Heathrow slots that IAG must relinquish under the 
commission's ruling, which cover UK and European destinations.

The Irish government faces competition from Ryanair to unload its stake in Aer Lingus after Etihad, the expansionist 
Middle Eastern airline, said it would be interested in buying Ryanair's holding in its smaller rival.
Etihad, which has  a 3 per cent holding in the Irish flag-carrier, has promised in the past to look at the government's 
25 per cent stake if and when Dublin decides to sell. A deal is one of the government's priorities under plans to 
reduce national borrowing.
But James Hogan, Etihad chief executive, told Bloomberg News this week that he would also be "very happy" to 
talk to Ryanair about purchasing part of its 30 per cent share in the group.
The low-cost carrier is on its third attempt in six years to buy the whole of Aer Lingus. It is expected in the next two 
weeks to submit to European regulators a package of remedies meant to allay competition concerns surrounding a 
potential deal.
The group is offering Aer Lingus investors EUR1.30 a share, which values the company's equity at EUR694m. 
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, is understood nonetheless to be open to offers for his company's holding.
People close to Etihad said Mr Hogan had not approached Ryanair about a possible share sale. Rules barring 
foreign companies from owning a majority stake in a European airline would prevent Etihad from taking on the 
whole Ryanair holding, since Irish company law stipulates that an investor with 30 per cent of issued shares must 
make an offer for the whole group.
Etihad eyes Ryanair 's Aer Lingus stake
That also means any purchase by Etihad of a significant portion of Ryanair's stake would preclude it from making 
an offer for the state's holding.
It would also make finding a different buyer for the government stake difficult, said Geof Collyer, an analyst at 
Deutsche Bank who predicted two months ago that Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus was a gambit to sell its own 
holding.
"Our view was that offering EUR1.30 [a share] was them saying, 'This is what we want for our stake'," he said on 
Thursday.
Ryanair declined to comment on what it called speculation and rumour.
Its relationship with Aer Lingus has long been fraught and is currently the subject of an investigation by the UK 
Competition Commission. The regulator is looking at whether Ryanair's stake gives it influence over operations at 
its main rival for flights into and out of Ireland.

Shares in Flybe, the European regional airline, plunged as much as a fifth after the group warned that its revenue 
growth would come in below expectations.
Flybe said that revenue growth for the full year to March 2013 would be between zero and 2 per cent, as a slump in 
European business travel, which accounts for 40 per cent of the group's flights, weighs on the airline.
Flybe's shares fell 15 per cent to 65p in morning trading, in a move exacerbated by thin August markets.
Jim French, chairman and chief executive at the group, blamed weak consumer markets and "stubbornly high oil 
prices" for the drop in projected revenue growth.
"We remain cautious over the outlook and do not expect a material recovery in either consumer or business 
confidence in the short term," said Mr French.
The regional airline suffers from a lack of visibility on earnings, with the bulk of its tickets sold just 10 to 15 days 
ahead of travel. Only 3 per cent of the group's winter schedule has been sold already this year.
While group revenue rose 1.6 per cent to £163m year on year in the first quarter, total passenger numbers in the 
group's UK division fell 3 per cent year on year to 1.9m in the first quarter of 2012.
The group said it would respond to the reduced revenue forecast with cost cuts, focusing on supplier cost reduction 
and slimming the number of flights.
Flybe warns on revenue growth
"We . . . remain focused on executing our comprehensive action plan to both expand the business whilst mitigating 
cost pressures," said Mr French
Flybe, which has been relatively successful in maintaining costs in the past, said that it would keep unit cost 
increases to within 1 per cent of the prior year, excluding fuel costs.
The distribution of its UK hubs also hit the regional airline, according to analysts. While competitors Ryanair and 
easyJet are exposed mainly to routes flying from the south-east of England, Flybe specialises in flights from 
regional airports, with stagnation in local economies taking its toll on the airline.
Flybe has a 28.3 per cent share of internal flights in the UK, which rises to a little over half when flights from London 
are excluded.

Parallel probes for Ryanair stake

UK and European regulators are set to investigate in parallel Ryanair's investment in Aer Lingus after an appeals 
court rejected the low-cost carrier's attempt to stop a Competition Commission probe.
Ryanair had asked the Competition Appeals Tribunal (CAT) to put a halt to the UK regulator's investigation into the 
airline's influence over Aer Lingus through its 25 per cent stake in the group. The CC decided in July to continue the 
probe despite Ryanair's July bid for the whole of Aer Lingus.
The budget carrier argued a UK probe would infringe on the European Commission's jurisdiction as it considers 
whether to stop the EUR1.30-per-share offer on competition grounds.
But the appeals tribunal said on Wednesday that while the CC should "avoid taking any decision running counter to 
a decision adopted, or which might be adopted, by the European Commission in relation to the public bid", it could 
do this without dropping its own investigation.
Aer Lingus welcomed the ruling. Ryanair said it would appeal.
The European Commission has already stymied an earlier Ryanair gambit for Aer Lingus. But Michael O'Leary, 
Ryanair's chief executive, argues European aviation has changed significantly since its last move on the Irish flag-
carrier, and that a union of the two would position Aer Lingus to thrive even in a consolidating industry.
Ryanair has not made public the remedies it might offer the European Commission to help win approval. A decision 
by the commission is expected in the first half of next year.
Parallel probes for Ryanair stake
Meanwhile, Aer Lingus has urged investors - including the Irish government, which is looking to sell its 25 per cent 
stake - to reject the offer. It got a fillip on Wednesday when a group of trade unions said its constituents agreed the 
EUR694m all-cash bid "fundamentally undervalues" the company.
The Central Representative council added that its members mistrusted Ryanair's stated intentions. The airline has 
said it would add jobs at its smaller rival but change workers' terms of employment.
The UK's Office of Fair Trading began looking into Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus two years ago but only referred the 
case to the CC in June, arguing it gave the budget carrier influence over Aer Lingus's strategy and operations, 
which could curb competition given the two carriers together carry eight in 10 passengers flying between the UK 
and Ireland.
Both Ryanair and Aer Lingus shares closed slightly down on Wednesday.

An Australian infrastructure group has positioned itself as a bidder for London's third-biggest airport, Stansted, after 
winning the contest to buy a £1bn stake in Manchester Airports Group.
The deal agreed with Industry Funds Management, which fought off competition from Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-
shing, is conditional on MAG winning any future contest for Stansted, which UK competition authorities have 
ordered its owner BAA to sell.
MAG, which is owned by the 10 councils of Greater Manchester, is keen to add Stansted to its four-airport portfolio 
and this winter laid out plans for a part-privatisation that would raise money for a deal. The agreement with IFM, 
worth about £1bn according to people close to the discussions, would give the Australians 35 per cent of MAG's 
equity but an equal share of voting rights with Manchester City Council.
The other shortlisted bidders were Cheung Kong Infrastructure, the investment vehicle of Li Ka-shing, and a joint 
venture by UK private equity group 3i and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. People close to the contest said IFM 
offered more money for MAG and promised to put more into a Stansted bid.
The timing of a sale of Stansted remains uncertain because its owner, BAA, a division of Spanish infrastructure 
group Ferrovial, is still fighting a 2009 order to sell the facility. It is seeking a Supreme Court hearing after having its 
case rejected by the UK Court of Appeal last week.
Should a Stansted sale go ahead, analysts expect the airport to fetch about £1bn. It is likely to attract a wide range 
of potential investors, including trade buyers, infrastructure funds and pension funds, with the latter group interested 
in the safe, inflation-pegged returns offered by regulated airports.
Australian group eyes Stansted airport
There are also growth opportunities, with passenger volumes down significantly from five years ago. Ryanair, the 
airport's dominant carrier, has said it has spoken with potential buyers over taking part in a bid. But one person 
close to the Manchester deal said he would be surprised if the airport group was in talks with the low-cost carrier.
As well as Manchester airport, MAG owns East Midlands, Bournemouth and Humberside airports - though it 
announced a deal on Thursday to sell its 82 per cent stake in Humberside.
Under the terms of the IFM deal, Manchester City Council will see its equity stake diluted from 55 per cent to 35 per 
cent. The 45 per cent equity stake held by nine other local councils will be reduced to 30 per cent and they will give 
up their voting rights entirely.
A Stansted bid would not be MAG's first attempt to enter the London market. Three years ago, it made an offer for 
Gatwick airport but lost out to Global Infrastructure Partners, which also owns London City Airport and which this 
year paid BAA £807m for Edinburgh Airport.
IFM has $34bn in funds under management and holds stakes in 26 infrastructure companies in Australia, Europe 
and the US.

International Airlines Group on Friday cut its financial guidance for 2012, saying it now expects to make an 
operating loss this year because of Spain's economic crisis.
IAG is preparing to make job cuts at Iberia, the Spanish flag carrier, after the subsidiary recorded a EUR263m 
operating loss in the first half of 2012.
The group, which also owns British Airways, was previously seeking to break-even at the operating level this year, 
but now expects to make a "small operating loss" after restructuring costs.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said the restructuring plan for Iberia should be finalised by September.
"Iberia's problems are deep and structural and the economic environment reinforces the need for permanent 
structural change," he said. "This is likely to include . . . a re-evaluation of all aspects of the business to deliver 
competitive costs and service to enable long term profitable growth.
"Inevitably, we will not be able to avoid job losses as part of the process.
The restructuring could further exacerbate tense industrial relations at Iberia, where pilots went on strike this year in 
protest at the creation of a low-cost carrier, called Iberia Express.
IAG disclosed that it had set up a eurozone crisis management group, which has considered the implications for the 
group of a possible Spanish exit from the single European currency.
IAG cuts guidance on Iberia woes
IAG was formed last year from the merger of BA and Iberia, and the two subsidiaries are reporting starkly 
contrasting results.
BA recorded a EUR13m operating profit for the six months to June 30, partly thanks to demand for long-haul flights 
over the North Atlantic.
But Iberia's EUR263m operating loss highlighted how a combination of recession and strong competition from low-
cost carriers led by Ryanair and EasyJet is hurting the subsidiary.
IAG reported revenue of EUR8.5bn for the first half of 2012, up 9.8 per cent compared with the same period last 
year.
The group's EUR253m operating loss before exceptional items compared to a EUR88m profit a year ago, and the 
deterioration was mainly caused by Iberia's weakness and a 25 per cent increase in fuel costs.
It contributed to a pre-tax loss of EUR390m for the first half of this year, compared with a profit of EUR39m last 
year. Net debt rose from EUR1.2bn for December 31 to EUR1.3bn on June 30.
IAG sought to reassure investors about BA's performance, saying underlying trading conditions "remain firm" and 
the integration of BMI British Midland, bought in April, was "on track".
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Execution Noble, said IAG's cut to its full-year guidance was "not a huge disappointment", 
but said analysts' estimates could be reduced in response.

International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, on Friday cut its financial guidance for 2012,

The group is preparing to make job cuts at Iberia, its Spanish subsidiary, after IAG reported a pre-tax loss of

IAG also disclosed it has set up a eurozone crisis management unit, which is meeting every two weeks to consider 
the implications for the group of a possible Spanish exit from the single European currency.
IAG was previously seeking to break-even at the operating level this year, but now expects to make a "small 
operating loss" after restructuring costs. In afternoon trading, the group's shares were down more than 3 per cent at 
154.5p.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said a root and branch restructuring plan for Iberia should be finalised by 
September. "Inevitably, we will not be able to avoid job losses as part of the process," he added.
The restructuring could further exacerbate tense industrial relations at Iberia, where pilots went on strike this year in 
protest at the creation of a low-cost carrier, called Iberia Express.
Mr Walsh would not rule out moving Iberia Express' domicile outside Spain after an arbitration ruling in May that 
required Iberia to put all pilots on the same pay scale even if working conditions in the two parts of the company are 
different.
IAG cuts guidance on Iberia woes
He said IAG's preference was for Spain to retain the single currency, because of the risk that the country's exit from 
the eurozone could help trigger a global recession.
IAG was formed last year from the merger of BA and Iberia, and the two subsidiaries are reporting starkly 
contrasting results.
BA recorded a EUR13m operating profit for the six months to June 30, partly thanks to demand for long-haul flights

IAG reported revenue of EUR8.5bn for the six months to June 30, up 9.8 per cent compared with the same period

But a 25 per cent increase in fuel costs, coupled with Iberia's weakness, pushed IAG to a pre-tax loss of EUR390m, 
compared with a profit of EUR39m in the first half of last year. Net debt rose from EUR1.2bn at December 31 to

Aer Lingus urges rejection of Ryanair bid

Aer Lingus on Tuesday urged shareholders to reject Ryanair's takeover offer, claiming the transaction would harm 
competition in a worse manner than when the European Commission blocked a previous bid by the Irish low-cost 
carrier in 2007.
Aer Lingus highlighted how the number of routes out of Ireland where the two airlines are the only operators has 
increased significantly, from 22 in 2007 to 44 in 2012, and concluded the Commission was therefore likely to repeat 
its previous action and veto this year's bid.
The statement of objections to what is Ryanair's third takeover bid for Aer Lingus in six years came as the Irish flag 
carrier also reported interim results, in which its underlying operating loss narrowed to EUR4.4m in the six months 
to June 30, from EUR26.9m in the same period last year.
Aer Lingus said if current trends continue its 2012 operating profit should at least match the EUR49.1m recorded in 
2011. In morning trading, Aer Lingus' shares were up 1 per cent at EUR1.09.
"Your board has received legal advice that the European Commission is likely once more to prohibit the Ryanair 
offer as the number of routes into and out of Ireland that Ryanair would monopolise has sharply increased," said 
Colm Barrington, Aer Lingus' chairman, in a letter to shareholders.
Ryanair has not spelt out what concessions it might make to try and secure the Commission's approval, but Mr 
Barrington claimed the low-cost carrier could be willing to relinquish some of Aer Lingus' valuable take-off and 
landing slots at London's Heathrow airport.
Aer Lingus urges rejection of Ryanair bid
"This could jeopardise both future competition and connectivity from Ireland via Heathrow, as some airlines 
interested in securing valuable Heathrow slots may commit to operate them on routes to Ireland for a limited period 
of time only," he said.
In its offer launched in June, Ryanair offered EUR1.3 per Aer Lingus share, valuing the flag carrier's equity at 
EUR694m.
Aer Lingus claimed the offer significantly undervalued it, noting that its gross cash position of EUR1.1bn implied the 
carrier was worth EUR1.96 per share.
The carrier reported revenue of EUR626.3m for the first half of 2012, up 10.1 per cent on the same time last year.
In what is normally a seasonally weak period for the carrier, Aer Lingus' pre-tax loss rose from EUR13.7m in the 
first half of 2011 to EUR24.5m in the same period this year.
The deterioration was primarily caused by exceptional costs, including a planned relocation of maintenance activity 
on Airbus A330 aircraft from Shannon to Dublin, and EUR4.3m of advisory fees relating to Ryanair's bid.
Gerard Moore, analyst at Merrion, said Aer Lingus' results were slightly better than expected, but described the 
exceptionals as "disappointing".
Two pension schemes that past and current Aer Lingus' employees are members of were estimated to have deficits 
of EUR727m and EUR172m at June 30, although the carrier insists it has no responsibility to fix the shortfalls 
beyond existing contribution rates.

Ryanair has reported subdued fare rises in its first quarter and said it expected more of the same for the rest of the 
year as the eurozone crisis and recession continue to weigh on customers' willingness to spend.
The low-cost carrier and Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers lifted its average fare by 4 per cent to 
EUR44 in the three months to the end of June - an anaemic increase compared with last year's 16 per cent surge.
The growth was slower than expected and led the company to miss consensus forecasts for net income by 20 per 
cent. Adjusted profits after tax fell by almost 30 per cent year on year, to EUR99m, dragging back earnings per 
share from 9.35 cents to 6.86 cents.
Shares nevertheless rose 2.3 per cent to EUR4, a 20 per cent improvement on the price at the start of the year.
Howard Millar, chief financial officer, said this should be a time for the airline to raise fares, since capacity growth 
has slowed. But he blamed the poor European economy for Ryanair's inability to drive price increases higher.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said growth in yields was "dampened by the EU-wide recession, austerity 
measures and heavily discounted fares at our new bases". He added that while next winter's trading remained 
opaque, he expected those factors would continue to restrain fare growth.
But the company maintained its full-year guidance for between EUR400m and EUR440m in net profit, assuming 
non-fuel costs are level with last year's and fuel costs moderate, as expected.
Eurozone woes drag on Ryanair fares
The airline's fuel bill was EUR117m higher than last spring, although Mr Millar said the cost should come down later 
in the year.
Ryanair expects to benefit from consolidation in the airline industry, which should reduce the number of flights 
further, and is attempting to take part in the drive by buying Irish rival Aer Lingus. Mr Millar declined to comment on 
the deal, citing Irish takeover law.
He said however that Ryanair was still in talks with the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China over the 180 to 
200-seat single-aisle aircraft Comac is developing in the hopes of competing with Airbus and Boeing.
Baggage charges are included in Ryanair's average fare calculations. But ancillary revenues such as commissions 
on hotel and car rental rose at twice the rate of fares in the first quarter, a trend Mr Millar admitted was unusual 
considering the hesitation with which people spent money on tickets.
Passenger numbers rose 6 per cent, but the company expects that rate to fall back to 4 per cent for the full year. Mr 
Millar argued that Ryanair now occupies a unique niche in the market, as an "ultra low-fares" carrier, pointing out 
that rival easyJet's average fare was EUR78 in the quarter.

As nervous fliers know well, lack of visibility usually means the ride will be bumpy. And this is being so widely cited 
by European airlines, as they look ahead to the winter, that investors may want to brace too. On Monday, neither 
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, nor Air France-KLM, the French-Dutch flag carrier, cared to predict in any 
detail how the difficult economic climate - and prospect of more airline failures - will play out, particularly in terms of 
demand and ticket prices.
There, though, the similarity ended. Ryanair's first quarter after-tax profits were EUR100m, compared with 
EUR140m a year earlier and one-fifth lower than consensus estimates. But the year-on-year fall was driven largely 
by a EUR120m increase in the fuel bill. Investors, meanwhile, had been hoping the carrier would push up ticket 
prices by about 7 per cent. In fact, the rise was 4 per cent, due partly to some "promotional" pricing as new bases in 
the likes of Spain. Hungary and Poland are developed. Ryanair will again ground one-third of its fleet this winter, 
and, with the fuel cost impact declining as the year wears on, is holding to 2012/3 net profit guidance of EUR400m-
EUR440m. The balance sheet remains commendable, moving to EUR170m net cash balance.
By contrast, Air France-KLM made a EUR895m after-tax loss in the same quarter (its second) after a EUR370m 
restructuring provision and large "fair value" adjustments to hedging contracts. The EUR66m operating loss was 
better than expected, with stronger than anticipated passenger yields and load factors. But a big restructuring has 
yet to be pushed through, and net debt is EUR6.2bn, or 130 per cent of shareholders' funds.
For investors, the sector does offer some opportunities: European airline shares overall have outperformed this 
year. And on 12 times forward earnings, Ryanair's are not pricey. That said, it may not be the smoothest of rides 
ahead.

BAA has lost a key legal challenge to overturn an order made by competition regulators forcing it to sell Stansted 
airport.
The Court of Appeal dismissed arguments by the airports operator, owned by the Spanish infrastructure group 
Ferrovial, and upheld a decision by the Competition Appeal Tribunal ordering the sale.
BAA now plans to appeal to the Supreme Court, the UK's highest court but is coming close to exhausting its options 
through the UK legal system.
The court battle stems from a ruling by the Competition Commission in 2009 which found that BAA wielded unfair 
market power by owning three London airports and ordered it to sell Stansted and Gatwick.
BAA has already sold Edinburgh and Gatwick to Global Infrastructure Partners but continued to fight the 
competition regulators on Stansted in litigation which has so far lasted three years.
This week, Nicholas Green QC, acting for BAA, told the Court of Appeal that there were risks if the airports operator 
had limited time to sell the airport "in the midst of the worst financial gale known to the industry for many decades".
In written arguments BAA contended that the "cost" of it being forced to sell assets at a time not of its choosing 
could amount to a "very substantial diminution" in value of the likely proceeds of sale.
BAA loses Stansted court challenge
It also claimed in the written arguments that the earlier Competition Tribunal "erred in law" by its original 2009 report 
because by 2011, plans for new runways had been scrapped and "any competition dependent on the prospect of 
new runway capacity had to be discounted".
Should the Supreme Court decide not to hear the case, or uphold the Court of Appeal's judgment, analysts expect 
Stansted to fetch at least £1bn, or 12 times last year's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
Edinburgh Airport, which BAA sold this winter - also prompted by the 2009 market-power decision - went for £807m, 
or 17 times ebitda.
However, Stansted is regulated, meaning that the user fees it charges airlines are held in check and linked to 
inflation, and so it is seen as a less attractive target.
The airport has also seen a steep decline in passenger numbers in recent years and is dominated by Ryanair, the 
low-cost airline which accounts for three-quarters of traffic.
Meanwhile Ferrovial saw profits decline over the first half of the year as growth in its foreign services and 
construction divisions failed fully to offset falling activity in its recession-hit domestic market.
The company, which has weathered the collapse of Spain's construction industry through international 
diversification and asset sales, said first-half net profits declined by 15.2 per cent to EUR265m compared with a 
year ago and including a net capital gain from the sale of Edinburgh airport of EUR100m.
Revenues for the period grew 3.3 per cent to EUR3.66bn. Ebitda rose by 15.2 per cent to EUR440m.

Mr Green told the court that over a limited time period the "risk of loss was magnified for a variety of reasons" as it 
only allowed one round of bids in the midst of a "howling financial crisis".

amount to a "very substantial diminution" in value of the likely proceeds of sale.

Rosemary Choueka, head of EU, competition and regulation for law firm Lawrence Graham said the ruling was 
"unsurprising."
"BAA has done well to hang on to Stansted for three years following the CC's original decision. With the benefit of 
hindsight, it might conclude that it would have done better to sell the airport in 2009 than now, given the decline in 
the economic situation in that time," she said.
Laura Carstensen, chairman of the BAA Remedies Implementation Group and a member of the original Inquiry 
Group, said she was pleased with the decision.
"It remains the right decision in the interests of passengers and airlines and it is surely now time for BAA to accept 
the verdict and proceed with the sale," she said.

Aer Lingus rejects 'not credible' Ryanair

The board of Aer Lingus has rejected Ryanair's takeover approach as "not credible" given the regulatory hurdles it 
faces.
The Irish flag-carrier told shareholders on Wednesday that its low-cost rival's EUR1.30 a share offer - which was set 
out in detail on Tuesday - stood a good chance of being blocked by the European Commission, according to legal 
advice received by Aer Lingus's board.
Regulatory approval is seen as the biggest challenge to a deal, since the European Commission rejected an earlier 
attempt, six years ago, by the low-cost carrier to buy its national rival. Another bid launched in late 2008 was 
dropped before reaching European regulators.
"The reasons for prohibition are now even stronger than before: the number of routes that Ryanair would 
monopolise has sharply increased," said Aer Lingus on Wednesday.
The board also urged shareholders to ignore the offer on valuation grounds, pointing out that the EUR694m all-cash 
bid represents a 17 per cent discount to the company's net asset value per share, and that "the gross cash on Aer 
Lingus's balance sheet more than pays for Ryanair's offer".
This "represents a significant discount to the intrinsic value of the business", the company said.
Aer Lingus shares have fallen more than 50 per cent since flotation in 2006. But the company argues it has 
executed a turnround in recent years as evidenced by a EUR130m improvement in operating profits since 2009.
Aer Lingus rejects 'not credible' Ryanair
Still, a number of questions continue to surround the group, including how it will help fill an approximately EUR700m 
black hole in an employee pensions scheme and how it can fare as an independent carrier amid increasing 
consolidation in the aviation sector. Etihad, the Middle Eastern airline, took a 3 per cent stake in the group earlier 
this year, and the two companies are working on setting up a code-sharing agreement.
The government meanwhile is looking to sell its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus as part of Dubliln's deal with the 
EU, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund to pay down state debt.
If Dublin were to back this offer, it would seal a deal that requires 50 per cent shareholder approval, since Ryanair 
already holds 29 per cent of the shares. That stake, however, is at the centre of a separate investigation by the 
UK's Competition Commission over whether the holding is anti-competitive.
Leo Varadkar, Irish transport minister, on Tuesday announced four factors he will consider when evaluating the 
deal: what is best for passengers in terms of connectivity and fares, the price being offered, the impact on the Irish 
economy and "the views of the regulatory authorities in relation to any bid".
Aer Lingus said on Wednesday that legal advice suggested the UK regulator would find in its favour regarding 
Ryanair's "anti-competitive" stake. But the process has been delayed by Ryanair appealing over the Competition 
Commission's right to pursue its investigation while European regulators consider the takeover offer.
Aer Lingus is set to give a more detailed defence document in the next two weeks.
James Hollins, an analyst with Investec, said on Wednesday that regulators' dim view of Ryanair's dealings with Aer 
Lingus up to now "seems compelling evidence of a deal that will not complete and we, therefore, continue to 
evaluate Ryanair as a standalone business".
Aer Lingus shares were flat at EUR1.08 in early trading, while Ryanair's dipped slightly.

Aer Lingus would add jobs rather than shed them after a takeover by Ryanair, though workers' terms of 
employment would change, according to the low-cost carrier's detailed offer document.
Ryanair said its plan to raise annual passenger numbers at the Irish flag-carrier from 9.5m to 14m would 
necessitate hiring more pilots, cabin crew and engineers. It aims to achieve that growth by reducing ticket prices, 
while maintaining margins by boosting "the productivity of [Aer Lingus] staff" to reduce unit costs.
The plans were posted to Aer Lingus shareholders on Tuesday, giving the smaller airline's board until the end of the 
month to reply under Irish takeover law. Aer Lingus made no comment on Tuesday but last month said that the 
EUR694m bid undervalued the group and urged shareholders to take no action.
The EUR1.30 per share offer - a nearly 50 per cent premium on the average share price over the past six months 
but a steep discount to when the company made its debut on the market in 2006 - is Ryanair's third attempt in six 
years to buy its national rival.
The European Commission rejected the first sally on competition concerns and could prove a hurdle again. "What it 
all boils down to is, 'Are they going to get clearance?'," said Gerald Khoo, an analyst with Espirito Santo.
Ryanair said it would request clearance from the Commission "in the early course".
In the meantime, the company is wrangling with the UK's Competition Commission over whether the regulator 
should continue its investigation into the influence Ryanair wields through its 29 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.
Ryanair envisages creating Aer Lingus jobs
The Competition Appeal Tribunal will hear the case next Friday and is expected to rule by the end of the year, 
whereas the European regulator's decision would probably come in the first half of next year. "We will be carrying 
on with the investigation as best we can pending the CAT's judgment," said the Competition Commission.
Mr Khoo said that opposing rulings from the two regulators would create an absurd scenario: "If they [the European 
Commission] say you can have 100 per cent of the shares, it's perverse for the UK to come out and say no to 
having 29 per cent."
Ryanair argues that market conditions have changed significantly since 2006, including the creation of new capacity 
at Dublin Airport and consolidation across the sector.
The groups would operate separately under one holding company, according to the plans, with Ryanair continuing 
to serve budget customers on point-to-point flights, next to Aer Lingus's "high frequency, mid-frills short haul 
services to primary airports and its transatlantic operations".

Being the chief executive of a European airline is an apparently thankless job right now.
The immediate outlook is grim - European airlines are expected to report combined net losses of $1.1bn in 2012, 
principally because of the eurozone crisis, says the International Air Transport Association, the industry's main 
representative body. That compares with a combined profit of $500m last year.
"The eurozone crisis is standing in the way of improved profitability," said Tony Tyler, director-general of Iata, last 
month.
But there are some tentative signs that European airlines are heading towards a more profitable future - and that 
earnings could become more sustainable on a long-term basis.
Significant industry consolidation has been progressing for almost a decade. The latest move came in April, when 
International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways, bought BMI British Midland, in order to strengthen its position 
at London's Heathrow airport.
Amid the EU's sovereign debt crisis, consolidation is being accompanied by a spate of airline failures.
Hungary's Malev, and Barcelona-based Spanair have been the most high profile casualties this year.
This reduction in the number of airlines provides the remaining carriers with the opportunity to curb seating capacity 
growth - or even cut it - and therefore potentially raise fares.
European airlines: Consolidation should improve prospects
Meanwhile, Europe's three leading flag carriers - Air France-KLM, IAG and Lufthansa - are taking steps to reduce 
costs at underperforming short and medium haul operations.
And all of this comes against a backdrop of some relief from high fuel prices.
Since March, European jet fuel has fallen more than 15 per cent in price to about $940 per tonne. Europe 
undoubtedly has too many airlines - 320 in the 27 EU member states - partly because countries cling to the idea of 
having their own flag carrier.
The problem is arguably exacerbated by large aircraft leasing companies renting jets to airlines that cannot afford to 
buy them.
But it is possible to see the emergence of five large airline groups - Air France-KLM, EasyJet, IAG, Lufthansa and 
Ryanair.
EasyJet and Ryanair are enjoying the economic downturn, as consumers and business people increasing use the 
budget airlines for European travel in an effort to reduce their spending.
The big question for both carriers is how they tap further growth.
For example, Ryanair is seeking to buy more aircraft because its existing deal with Boeing is coming to an end, but 
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, may find it hard to purchase jets at cheap prices because the manufacturers have 
large order backlogs.
Air France-KLM, IAG and Lufthansa are also finally responding to the competitive challenge from Ryanair and 
EasyJet by seeking cost savings at short and medium-haul operations.
They have laid out ambitious plans to cut staff costs, although it is far from certain that they will succeed because of 
resistance from trade unions.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at HSBC, said: "We expect union opposition, industrial action and cost creep to erode 
the benefits that are ultimately negotiated. But we do expect progress."
Air France-KLM, which is burdened by high operating costs and a large debt load, last month announced plans to 
cut more than 5,000 staff in France, or 10 per cent of the domestic workforce. In a nod to the new Socialist 
government of President François Hollande - and in an effort to avoid conflict with France's strike-prone unions - Air 
France said it would seek voluntary redundancies.
But it warned that compulsory job losses would be unavoidable if no deal was possible with the unions.
IAG, which is also the parent of Spain's Iberia, last year created a new low-cost carrier in Spain called Iberia 
Express, where pilots are paid less than their counterparts at the main airline.
The move prompted strikes at Iberia, and last month the company announced that it would mount a legal challenge 
to an arbitrator's ruling that the carrier must include all  of its pilots in the same overall pay scale, even if working 
conditions in the two parts of the business are different.
The bright spot for Europe's main flag carriers has been their transatlantic long-haul operations, where they are 
benefiting from the quasi-consolidation that stems from them forming joint ventures with US airlines over the past 
decade.
Christoph Franz, chief executive of Lufthansa, said in May: "We do feel that this is bringing more rationality in the 
development of capacity and pricing."
One of Mr Franz's key concerns is the competitive threat posed by the three fast-growing Gulf carriers - Emirates, 
Etihad and Qatar Airways.
European airlines: Consolidation should improve prospects
There is little sign of the threat diminishing, although it could reduce as the Gulf carriers enter code-sharing 
agreements with European airlines.
Meanwhile, Europe is expecting more consolidation between carriers.
TAP Portugal, the Portuguese flag carrier, is due to be privatised this year, and could attract interest from Lufthansa 
and IAG.
One closely watched move will be Ryanair's third takeover bid for Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, which was 
launched last month.
The two previous bids failed after objections by European competition authorities, and it is likely that the European 
Commission will also have objections to Ryanair's latest offer for Aer Lingus, which values the carrier's equity at 
EUR694m.
But this time around the Irish government may look more favourably at Ryanair's bid because, under the terms of 
the country's bailout by the EU and the International Monetary Fund, it wants to sell its 25 per cent stake in Aer 
Lingus.
The dilemma therefore for the competition authorities is whether - knowing Europe has too many airlines - they 
should block Ryanair's third bid.

Etihad Airways is not willing to sell its 3 per cent stake in Aer Lingus raising fresh doubts over Ryanair's takeover 
bid for the Irish flag carrier.
James Hogan, chief executive of the fast-growing Gulf airline, said on Wednesday that Etihad was backing Aer 
Lingus's current management and its strategy. "We are not selling," he said.
Ryanair launched its third takeover bid in six years for Aer Lingus last month, offering EUR1.30 per share, which 
values the carrier's equity at EUR694m.
Aer Lingus responded by saying that the bid undervalued the company, and told shareholders to take no action in 
response to the offer.
Etihad announced in May that it had bought a 2.99 per cent stake in Aer Lingus and Mr Hogan confirmed on 
Wednesday that it was interested in the possibility of purchasing the Irish government's 25 per cent stake in the 
carrier.
"Our equity investments are strategic and long term," he said. "We have invested due to our view of the Aer Lingus 
business model and the success the management are having implementing that model. We continue to support that 
management team."
Mr Hogan said Etihad had not held any discussions with Ryanair, which stated last month that it was prepared to 
work with the Gulf carrier if it bought the Irish government's stake in Aer Lingus.
Etihad to hold Aer Lingus stake
Instead, Mr Hogan said Etihad and Aer Lingus were in talks about the possibility of a code-sharing agreement. 
Ryanair could not be reached for comment.
Analysts said last month that Ryanair's latest takeover bid for Aer Lingus could be blocked by the European 
Commission, which objected to the first offer made in 2006.
The Irish government last month expressed concerns about antitrust issues associated with Ryanair's takeover bid, 
although it stressed it did not have a veto.
The government is planning to sell its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus under the terms of Ireland's bailout 
agreement with the EU and the International Monetary Fund.
Foreign ownership rules almost certainly prevent Etihad from buying a controlling stake in Aer Lingus or another EU 
airline.
However, Etihad last December agreed to buy a 29 per cent stake in Air Berlin, Germany's second-largest airline.
Through commercial partnerships with the carriers in which it has bought minority stakes, Etihad is seeking to 
secure additional passengers for its long-haul operations.
Mr Hogan said Etihad was holding talks with Air France-KLM about the possibility of a code-sharing agreement but 
stressed that there were no discussions about an equity investment and nothing had been finalised.
Etihad on Wednesday reported revenue of $1.3bn for the three months to June 30, up 31 per cent compared to the 
same time last year. It did not disclose earnings.

Gareth Williams looks every inch the web entrepreneur: black shirt, jeans and enviable tan. Skyscanner's offices 
tick all the dotcom boxes too: prime location, wall-to-wall natural wood and smoked glass, video-game zone and a 
kitchen chock-full of free fruit and drinks.
Except this is Edinburgh's Princes Street, not Silicon Valley. And Skyscanner, the online flight search company Mr 
Williams co-founded just as the last dotcom bubble burst, has climbed to the number-two spot in its sector through 
careful and cautious growth, not boosterish hype. It now has 20m unique visitors a month, who together spend 
more than £2bn a year. "I remember when we boasted that everyone who used our site could fill the Albert Hall," he 
says. "Now the numbers are getting scary."
The business Mr Williams hatched in a London pub with two student friends has travelled a very different and more 
measured route from its main rival, Connecticut-based Kayak. While Skyscanner spent seven years building its 
model before seeking a first round of venture capital funding - £2.5m from Scottish Equity Partners (SEP) - market 
leader Kayak, which was founded three years later, has raised more than $220m, splashing the cash on acquiring 
competitors and paying Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey to narrate its ads on primetime television in the US. It is 
thought to be planning an initial public offering once the Facebook storm quells.
But don't mistake Skyscanner's more considered approach for shiftlessness. "We don't want to stop at beingthe 
most successful flight search engine in Edinburgh," says Mr Williams. His goal is to make the business Scotland's 
first billion-dollar web company.
Skyscanner is a vertical search engine - one that provides answers for one specific topic - storing all flight data on 
its own servers. Yet search results are delivered in less than a second.
A carefully managed take-off
"The model allows us to present data how we choose," he says, meaning the company can tailor results to 
individual consumers' requirements.
We might have been discussing online pub jukeboxes, another idea on the table that lager-fuelled evening when 
the three friends - all freelance programmers - cast their votes. But Bonamy Grimes and Barry Smith were won over 
by Mr Williams' passion for the Excel spreadsheet he had created to help find the cheapest fare to French ski 
resorts. The trio agreed that Messrs Smith and Grimes would continue their contract work but share their salaries 
so Mr Williams could develop the site full-time.
"I'd got tired of not putting my all into something," says Mr Williams of his time as a freelance IT contractor. "Budget 
airlines like easyJet, Ryanair, Go and Buzz were starting up, but there was no way of comparing prices or 
discovering new routes that had just opened."

Mr Williams programmed a tool that extracted data from the airlines' programs to collect the routes and prices for 
his spreadsheet.
They had little idea where to find revenues, but Mr Williams recalls14-hour days spent coding, convinced that if he 
found it useful, others would too. "We've always had faith that as long as we keep building stuff that would make our 
travelling easier, then we will grow our users. We didn't have friends or family investment, so we could really 
concentrate on user benefits, without investors' interests diverting us."
In fact, BMI, rather than a budget airline, became the first airline to agree to pay a referral fee followed by British 
Airways. "That was down to Barry's emerging skills of business development and his persistence in explaining how 
much cheaper it was to get a sale through Skyscanner," says Mr Williams.
Still, it took two years to reach £100 a day in revenue, and another two years to ring up £1,000 a day.
By 2005, all three founders were working on Skyscanner full-time.Mr Williams had moved to Edinburgh with his 
Scottish wife, and persuaded the other two to join him. By 2007, they had 15 employees, but had neither the 
experience nor resources to extend the service beyond flights originating in the UK.
According to Mr Williams, it's easy to attract talent to a city as beautiful, and cosmopolitan as Edinburgh despite its 
relatively remote location. "The biggest challenge, is that we don't have a Twitter next door - a company that is 
showing truly world class growth and global presence. That means the ambition we have for our own growth has to 
be built from the inside out," he says.
The £2.5m cash injection from SEP enabled them to do both. Since then, website traffic and revenues have 
increased tenfold and the team has expanded to 150 people representing 30 nationalities. The site, which turns 
over £30m a year, is in 29 different languages and visitors outside the UK now account for more than 75 per cent of 
traffic.
The company, which turned its first profit in 2009, has opened a full-service office in Singapore, is about to open a 
smaller one in Beijing and plans another in the Americas next year. The funding enabled Skyscanner to hire senior 
executives with experience of running a fast-growing company, but also forced the three founders to decide on a 
chief executive. "None of us had titles, but one of us had to be CEO," says Mr Williams. "I wanted to be CTO but 
didn't want some idiot telling me what to do. So I became the idiot.
"The investment has brought more formality but we've learnt that we have to formalise certain things in order not to 
lose them."
A carefully managed take-off
Skyscanner launched an app last year, and mobile users now represents a third of traffic. The tech team, which 
accounts for half the workforce, is now developing voice-activated search functionality for the app.
Mr Williams is keen to push beyond flight search, giving users prices for rail, car hire, hotels, holiday packages, 
cruises, travel insurance and airport parking.
Meanwhile, Google has launched its own hotel and flight search tools and services and Microsoft's Bing Travel 
wants a slice of the pie as well. "We have to respect them all," admits Mr Williams, "but ultimately it comes down to 
our appetite as a company."
Skyscanner has not ruled out a stock market listing, but Mr Williams says he is happy to leave that decision to his 
board.
He does, however, still occasionally hanker for his pre-CEO days. "I miss coding, to be honest, but I do love the 
different challenges that arise as we get bigger."

Little about Ryanair should surprise us. This is the airline whose irrepressible chief executive, Michael O'Leary, 
once opined that "the customer is usually wrong". True to form, the statement that accompanied the budget airline's 
June 19 cash offer for rival Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, contained a memorably impudent flourish.
The Irish government, which owns a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, stands to realise EUR174m if the acquisition 
goes ahead on Ryanair's terms at EUR1.30 a share, plus another EUR4m from an Aer Lingus dividend.
"This," Ryanair observed sententiously, "is clearly beneficial in the context of the current recessionary environment 
and will make a valuable contribution towards budget spending in such important areas as health and education."
Since when, one might ask, have airlines been advising governments how to raise money for social expenditure?
The statement was a naked attempt to exploit the government's sense of financial vulnerability after Ireland's 
multibillion-euro rescue by its European partners and the International Monetary Fund. Mr O'Leary might as well 
have put all pretence aside and told the government: "You're stony broke. I'm in the money. Sell up now."
From a different perspective, the statement's underlying purpose was to throw up a smokescreen to obscure the 
serious competition issues that surround Ryanair's bid. Europe's biggest low-fare carrier amassed a 29.8 per cent 
stake in Aer Lingus after the airline's 2006 privatisation. But that year European Union competition regulators 
prevented Ryanair from taking full control and now the UK's competition commission is investigating the market 
impact of Ryanair's holding.
It is also misleading to dismiss Aer Lingus, as Ryanair does, as "a small and uncompetitive airline" that is "overly 
dependent on a deteriorating Irish economy".
Ryanair seeks an updraft amid turbulence
Such assertions sit oddly next to Ryanair's own acknowledgment that Aer Lingus made a EUR84.4m pre-tax profit 
in 2011. Moreover, Aer Lingus recorded higher revenues, passenger numbers and total yield per passenger last 
year on both long-haul and short-haul flights. At year's end, it had EUR895m in gross cash on its balance sheet.
Undeniably, the European airline industry is experiencing severe turbulence. Air France, the French unit of Air 
France-KLM, says it must shed more than 5,000 jobs, or about 10 per cent of its workforce, by the end of next year. 
Malev and Spanair, the Hungarian and Catalan carriers, have gone belly up. More consolidation is necessary and 
probably not far away. But Aer Lingus does not deserve to be caricatured as a zombie airline.
The competition concerns centre on the shared domination exerted by Aer Lingus and Ryanair over the Irish 
market. According to the Dublin airport authority, the two airlines had a combined 73 per cent of traffic there in 2007 
but four years later it had risen to 80 per cent.
This level of market concentration is hardly surprising for a small island nation on the edge of a densely populated 
continent. But they do at least ensure a reasonable degree of competition between Aer Lingus and Ryanair, 
keeping prices down for passengers. Unless the newly combined airline were to give up a substantial number of 
routes to new competitors, a merger would put this in jeopardy.
Here a paradox comes into play. A recession-driven downturn in traffic at Dublin airport is increasing the availability 
of operating slots. But few airlines will be interested in acquiring these slots if recession means there are not 
enough passengers to justify the cost.
This is Mr O'Leary's chance. In his eyes, the dark macroeconomic backdrop is one of two good reasons for reviving 
his pursuit of Aer Lingus. The second is the slow but steady reconfiguration of the European airline sector.
For example, International Airlines Group, which unites British Airways with Spain's Iberia, has acquired BMI from 
Lufthansa, a step that may discourage new entrants from installing themselves at London's Heathrow airport. If 
British Airways can strengthen itself in such a fashion, why should Ryanair be deprived of the same opportunity?
Of course, Europe's regulators may not see matters this way. But Mr O'Leary has nothing to lose by testing the 
waters. At worst, he drives up the Aer Lingus share price and smokes out potential bidders such as Etihad, the Abu 
Dhabi-based carrier. At best, he bags the elephant.

There is much to admire in Michael O'Leary's terrier-like qualities. But, with his third bid for Aer Lingus in six years, 
is he just banging his head against a brick wall?
There is a poisonous rivalry between the Irish flag carrier and Mr O'Leary's Ryanair. But his first takeover bid in 
2006 was scuppered not by Aer Lingus's unwillingness to be swallowed by its more successful competitor, but by 
Europe's competition authorities. The second was foiled by the Irish government - which owns a quarter of Aer 
Lingus - sniffily dismissing the price offered.
So why does Mr O'Leary think it's worth another try?
He is certainly offering a persuasive price. Ryanair's offer of EUR1.30 per share in cash is nearly 40 per cent higher 
than Aer Lingus' pre-offer share price, and values the airline significantly above its peers. And while Aer Lingus is 
certainly no longer the basket case it used to be - it made a small pre-tax profit last year - its shareholders might 
well be grateful that Ryanair would also take on some particularly nasty pension liabilities.
For Ryanair shareholders, a purchase would be a useful way to deploy the airline's available cash, and there is no 
doubt that Aer Lingus would benefit financially from Mr O'Leary's famous, if not notorious, cost-cutting skills. 
Meanwhile the government could sell its 25 per cent stake - a requirement of the country's bailout.
But it is also possible that Mr O'Leary is playing a more cunning game. The UK Competition Commission is looking 
into whether Ryanair's current 29.9 per cent stake in Aer Lingus is anti-competitive. The bid could, at the very least, 
delay a decision - and thus a possible forced sale of the stake in what are far from ideal market conditions.
High time for Irish carriers to consolidate
Alternatively Mr O'Leary may be trying to flush out an alternative bidder for Aer Lingus, which would allow Ryanair 
to exit gracefully (albeit still probably at a large loss). This seems less likely, in that prospective buyers, such as the 
Abu Dhabi-based airline Etihad, which already owns 3 per cent of Aer Lingus, may well be stymied by restrictions 
on foreign ownership.
These very restrictions, though, highlight how old-fashioned the rules governing airline takeovers are. Mr O'Leary 
argues that the world has changed since he last bid for Aer Lingus - and he has a point. For never has the need for 
airline consolidation been greater. This month the International Air Transport Association forecast that European 
airlines would report a combined net loss of $1.1bn this year, one of several years of losses in the past decade. 
Even the strongest, such as International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways and Iberia, are only expecting to 
break even. Yet barely any airline has gone under, or merged with a rival.
For Ireland to have two large airlines has always seemed anomalous. This is one brick wall that deserves to be 
knocked down.

Air France kicked off what could be a wave of large-scale redundancy programmes in France in the coming months 
when it announced plans to cut more than 5,000 jobs, or some 10 per cent of its domestic workforce, over the next 
18 months.
As the most troubled part of the merged group Air France-KLM, the French airline is battling to overcome the 
burden of staffing costs that are some 30 per cent higher than those of its rivals - including fellow "legacy" operators 
such as Lufthansa as well as low-cost competitors such as Ryanair and easyJet.
The redundancy programme is part of a plan, called Transform 2015, to cut EUR2bn in costs, achieve a 20 per cent 
increase in productivity and get the airline back to break-even in 2014. Air France-KLM, carrying more than 
EUR6bn in net debt, reported an operating loss of EUR597m in the first quarter on revenues of EUR5.7bn.
In a nod to the new Socialist government, which holds a 16 per cent stake in Air France-KLM - and in an effort to 
avoid conflict with France's notoriously strike-prone trade unions - Air France said all the redundancies would be 
carried out on a voluntary basis if it could reach agreement with the unions. But it warned that compulsory job 
losses would be unavoidable if no deal was done.
The scale of the job cuts may be a taste of things to come in France as the economy has stalled and the country's 
industrial competitiveness has plunged, especially compared with neighbouring Germany. Redundancies and plant 
closures are expected in the car, steel, telecoms, banking and other industries.

The phrase broken windows used to conjure up images of urban vandalism and zero tolerance. Now it is more likely 
to bring Microsoft to mind. In an effort to revive its most important product, Windows software, the US tech giant 
unveiled its Surface tablet computer, but there are still big questions about pricing and functionality.
Microsoft was not the only company looking for a new model. Both Verizon and Comcast have introduced new 
rational pricing plans to prevent customer arbitrage, but that strategy might result in cut-throat discounting wars. In 
Asia, Hon Hai and Sharp's LCD alliance may lead to a way to regenerate Japanese tech has-beens and allow lost-
cost producers to move to higher-margin businesses. In telecoms, Dutch group KPN continued to defend its less-
than-stellar past model - while trying unsuccessfully to wring value from its German operations - as it opposes 
advances from Carlos Slim's América Móvil.
Elsewhere it was about British engineers and flying machines. UK engineering turnround specialist Melrose 
revealed it was in talks to buy German meter-maker Elster while Invensys saw its share price rise and fall after 
disclosing a takeover approach by Emerson Electric. Meanwhile Ryanair made its third bid in six years for rival Irish 
carrier Aer Lingus and the founder of Brazilian airline Gol unexpectedly announced he would step down next month.
Finally in consumer goods, US drugstore Walgreens agreed to pay $6.7bn for a 45 per cent stake in UK pharmacy-
based retailer Alliance Boots while both Procter & Gamble and Danone warned of lower earnings ahead. But 
perhaps the most intriguing deal of the week involved several independent-minded billionaires with one selling 
media assets - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp offering A$2bn for James Packer's Consolidated Media - in order to 
place bets on a gambling company. Oh and then there was Greece and Spain, but you may have already read 
about their broken models somewhere before.

Air France-KLM is to cut more than 5,000 posts in France as part of a EUR2bn cost cutting programme, confronting 
the new Socialist government with the biggest job reduction plan it has faced since it took power last month.
The airline said on Thursday it was seeking agreement with unions to reduce its Air France workforce by 5,122 by 
the end of next year, a cut of some 10 per cent, through natural attrition, voluntary redundancies and part-time 
working. But it warned that it would have to resort to compulsory lay-offs if no agreement was reached.
"Air France faces a decisive choice for its future," said Alexandre de Juniac, chief executive of Air France.
Air France-KLM, which reported a net loss last year of EUR809m and a worse than expected operating loss of 
EUR597m in the first quarter of this year, is battling high operating costs and a heavy debt burden.
Facing mounting competition from both more efficient traditional rivals and especially low-cost carriers such as 
Ryanair and easyJet, it has targeted a 20 per cent improvement in productivity by 2015.
The commitment to cut jobs through voluntary departures, if agreed, will reduce the risk of industrial conflict at Air 
France, which has been plagued by strikes over the years.
But it is also a concession to the government, owner of a 15 per cent stake in Air France-KLM, which is facing a 
series of potential redundancy programmes by big companies just as unemployment has crept up to 10 per cent of 
the workforce and the economy has stalled.
Air France - KLM plans 5,000 job cuts
The government is planning to legislate against "abusive" redundancies and put in place tighter restrictions on plant 
closures in a bid to stem the number of potential redundancies threatened in the automobile, steel, telecoms, 
banking and other industries.
Air France said 1,712 of the total cuts among its 50,000 contracted French workers would be achieved through 
attrition, with the balance coming from retirement, voluntary departures, part-time working and work-sharing. The 
majority of departures will be among ground staff.
"If the plan goes as expected, recourse to compulsory departures will also be avoided in 2014," it said.
But it warned that, without agreement with the workforce "non-voluntary departures would not be avoidable".

Ryanair has made an audacious third attempt at taking over Aer Lingus, Ireland's flag carrier.
The Irish low-cost carrier unveiled an all-cash offer of EUR1.3 per Aer Lingus share on Tuesday, valuing the 
airline's equity at EUR694m, or a 38.3 per cent premium to its closing stock price.
Since Aer Lingus's flotation in 2006, Ryanair has mounted two takeover bids for the flag carrier, but both failed after 
objections by the Irish government and the European Commission. The Irish flag carrier urged its investors to take 
no action on Wednesday morning and said it would make a further announcement in due course.
This week, the UK Competition Commission announced an investigation into Ryanair's 29.8 per cent stake in Aer 
Lingus because of concerns that the shareholding may be damaging competition.
Ryanair argued that circumstances had "changed materially" since its first unsuccessful bid for Aer Lingus in 2006, 
highlighting consolidation involving European flag carriers and the Irish government's plan to sell its 25 per cent 
stake.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue, said: "This offer represents a 
significant opportunity to combine Aer Lingus with Ryanair to form one strong Irish airline group capable of 
competing with Europe's other major airline groups led by Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa."
In an attempt to persuade the competition authorities to clear the new bid, Ryanair pitched its offer as "pro-
consumer". It proposed to run its low-cost carrier separately from Aer Lingus, to maintain the two brands.
Ryanair makes third bid for Aer Lingus
Aer Lingus declined to comment on Ryanair's new bid.
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Espirito Santo, said the antitrust issues may have moved in Ryanair's favour since 2006. 
"But it is far from clear Ryanair will be able to secure clearance from the authorities," he added.
Two analysts said the Irish government would probably reject Ryanair's new bid after declaring last year it would 
oppose the low-cost carrier buying the state's 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus. The government has held 
discussions about selling its stake to Etihad, the fast-growing Gulf carrier that in May announced it had bought a 3 
per cent stake in Aer Lingus.
Ryanair has been engaged in an acrimonious confrontation with Aer Lingus, demanding payment of a dividend and 
complaining about several issues including the pension scheme, which has a large deficit.
In May, Aer Lingus announced it would pay a dividend for the first time since its flotation.
Aer Lingus reported revenue of EUR1.3bn for the year to December 31, up 6 per cent, and pre-tax profit of 
EUR84.4m, compared with EUR27.2m in 2010. It had net cash of EUR445.9m at March 31.

Aer Lingus on Wednesday urged its shareholders to take no action after Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline by 
revenues, launched its third offer for the Irish flag carrier in six years.
Shares in Aer Lingus surged more than 23 per cent or 22 euro cents to EUR1.16 on Wednesday morning after the 
airline said it would make a statement in due course.
The all-cash offer from Ryanair was valued at EUR1.3 per Aer Lingus share, valuing the airline's equity at 
EUR694m, or a 38.3 per cent premium to its closing stock price on Tuesday of 94 euro cents.
Since Aer Lingus's flotation in 2006, Ryanair has mounted two takeover bids for the flag carrier, but both failed after

Third time lucky? Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's outspoken chief executive, is hoping his third takeover bid in six years 
for Aer Lingus, Ireland's flag carrier, will be successful.
But Ryanair has a mountain to climb with European competition authorities, which rejected its first takeover 
proposal in 2006. Apart from Ryanair, no company has ever tried to resurrect a transaction previously banned by 
the European Commission.
Some analysts conclude Ryanair's new offer of EUR1.3 per Aer Lingus share, valuing the airline's equity at 
EUR694m, may be an attempt to flush out other bidders.
But European carriers are struggling with the eurozone crisis and Gulf airlines with sufficient financial firepower to 
launch a rival takeover offer would almost certainly be unable to do so because of foreign ownership restrictions.
Aer Lingus's board said on Wednesday that it believed Ryanair's offer undervalued the carrier and questioned 
whether the proposed transaction could be completed, partly because of the Commission's rejection of the 2006 
bid. The board advised shareholders to take no action in response to the offer.
Mr O'Leary's takeover quest has proved expensive. Since 2006, Ryanair has spent EUR407.2m amassing a 29.8 
per cent stake in Aer Lingus but the shareholding's value was written down to EUR79.7m in 2009 as the economic 
downturn took its toll on results.
Mr O'Leary argues the industry landscape has changed dramatically since Europe's largest low-cost carrier by 
revenue launched its first takeover bid for Aer Lingus.
Ryanair's Aer Lingus bid faces turbulence
He highlights industry consolidation that is leaving Europe with five big airline groups - Air France-KLM, EasyJet, 
International Airlines Group, Lufthansa and Ryanair.
Moreover, Ryanair's new takeover proposal, by creating a bigger Irish airline group with significant investment and 
employment plans, could go down well with some people in recession-battered Ireland.
Air Lingus has some obvious attractions to Ryanair. Christoph Mueller has made progress with the carrier's 
turnround since he became chief executive in 2009, when it was loss-making. Last year Aer Lingus reported pre-tax 
profit of EUR84.4m and at March 31 had a net cash position of EUR445.9m.
But while Aer Lingus is profitable, it looks subscale in the context of industry consolidation. By combining with 
Ryanair, Aer Lingus would secure its long-term future, with the budget airline able to apply its cost-cutting expertise 
across the enlarged group.
Mr O'Leary says Ryanair and Aer Lingus would operate as two separate brands. Aer Lingus would focus on short-
haul routes to large European airports that Ryanair does not fly to, such as London's Heathrow.
There are risks for Ryanair. Some of Aer Lingus's cash may be needed to fix large deficits in two pension schemes 
that the carrier's current and former employees are members of.
Of more immediate concern will be the attitude of the Irish government and the competition authorities.
Ryanair's new bid might have some appeal in Dublin, given it was priced at a 38.3 per cent premium to Aer Lingus's 
undisturbed share price on June 19.
The government has a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, which it is planning to sell under the terms of the Irish 
bailout agreed with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
But Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, on Wednesday expressed concerns about the anti-trust issues raised by 
Ryanair's bid, although he stressed the government did not have a veto.
Ryanair has notoriously poor relations with the Commission, which mainly assesses airline mergers on a route by 
route basis to see if competition will be diminished.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at HSBC, highlights how Ryanair and Aer Lingus together operate 79 per cent of flight 
departures from Dublin airport.
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Espirito Santo, says Ryanair's offer may have reduced the risk that it is forced to make a 
distressed sale of its stake in Aer Lingus; the UK Competition Commission could delay its new investigation into the 
shareholding following the bid.
He adds that even if the bid fails, Ryanair may well get a better exit from Aer Lingus if it flushes out an alternative 
bidder.
But apart from Ryanair, it is difficult to see who would pursue a takeover of Aer Lingus. Air France-KLM, IAG and 
Lufthansa are seen as unlikely suitors.
Etihad, the fast-growing Abu Dhabi-based carrier that announced last month it had bought a 3 per cent stake in Aer 
Lingus, has held talks about buying the Irish government's shareholding. But foreign ownership rules are likely to 
prevent Etihad from having a controlling stake in Aer Lingus.
So a potentially unstable shareholder structure could emerge at Aer Lingus, led by Ryanair and Etihad, and with Mr 
O'Leary unable to realise his takeover ambition.

According to Irish mythology, three sets of plucks on Daghdha's harp produced first tears, then mirth and finally 
sleep. Ryanair's third bid in six years for rival Irish carrierAer Lingus did not quite have the last effect. But reaction 
to the EUR700m offer was muted: Aer Lingus shares gained 15 per cent, but remained one-fifth below the EUR1.30 
offer price.
That reflects deep scepticism that Ryanair will ever get a merger deal past Europe's competition authorities. 
Brussels rebuffed the proposed tie-up in 2007 because it would mean a near-monopoly on short-haul flights into 
and out of Ireland, including more than 80 per cent of those via Dublin. Ryanair is right when it says that the world 
has changed markedly since then. But in this case, the two airlines - both profitable - remain dominant in their home 
market. Deutsche Bank estimates that, combined, they would control between 80-90 per cent of UK-Ireland and 
Europe-Ireland capacity. True, more terminal space removes a barrier to new entrants at Dublin, but this hardly 
guarantees effective competition. A more pertinent question may be whether concessions could be carved out to 
assuage competition worries. But the carriers provide rival services on about 30 Dublin-Europe routes, so these 
would have to be chunky - more perhaps than Ryanair would willing concede.
More convincing is the theory that the low-cost carrier wants to get out in front of a UK inquiry, begun a few days 
ago, into whether Ryanair should be required to dispose of its 29.9 per cent stake in Aer Lingus and hopes to flush 
out rival interest. The Irish government, with 25 per cent of Aer Lingus, is also under some pressure to dispose of its 
stake, given its financial problems. The problem is identifying would-be buyers, although Lufthansa, IAG and Etihad 
might have interest in parts Good Irish legends are lengthy, and this saga could run for a while yet.

"groundless".
Shares inAer Lingus climbed 15.4 per cent to EUR1.09 after Ryanair made an all-cash offer for the Irish flag carrier.
The offer of EUR1.30 per share represents a 38.3 per cent premium to the share price close on Tuesday, and is the 
third time Ryanair has approached Aer Lingus in six years.
Broader trading remained subdued ahead of news from the US Federal Reserve.

London stocks were trading a shade higher on Wednesday on expectations the Bank of England would expand its 
asset purchase scheme next month.
Minutes of the Bank's last Monetary Policy Committee meeting revealed strong support for an extension of the 
programme.
Although the MPC kept asset purchases on hold at £325bn at its June meeting, four out of the nine members voted 
for further quantitative easing, with three of these - including Bank governor Mervyn King - electing for a £50bn rise 
in QE.
The FTSE 100 climbed off its lows to trade 0.1 per cent higher at 5,589.32, a 3-point gain.
In the previous session, the index had jumped 1.8 per cent as investors had pinned their hopes on the Federal 
Reserve introducing a new round of stimulus measures to aid US economic recovery later on Wednesday.
"With the possibility of further stimulus seemingly priced in, there is scope for some disappointment as the FOMC 
members are far from unanimous in believing action is needed now," said Ian Williams at Peel Hunt.
The FTSE 100 was led by broadcaster ITV, the focus of bid talk as KKR was said to be among a number of private 
equity group interested in the company. Shares in ITV were up 3.2 per cent to 76.65p.
There was bid interest lower down the market as London-listed shares of Ryanair climbed 1.2 per cent to 4.02p 
after the budget airline company restarted its pursuit of rival Aer Lingus with a EUR694m offer.
Dovish Bank of England minutes lift FTSE
The mid-cap FTSE 250 remained down 0.1 per cent to 10,862.23, however, as retailers gave back some of the 
previous session's strong gains.
Kesa Electricals fell 7.2 per cent to 51.25p after it reported a 42 per cent fall in underlying profit and announced a 
dividend cut. The company said it did not see any improvement in its markets in the near future.
Home Retail Group, which climbed nearly 24 per cent on Tuesday after reporting improving sales at its Argos chain, 
gave back 4.3 per cent to 86p.
Among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 were Severn Trent and United Utilities as shares in the two water 
companies traded without rights to the latest dividend payment. Severn Trent fell 5.7 per cent to £16.49 while 
United Utilities lost 2.6 per cent to 652p.

London stocks were trading a shade lower on Wednesday as retailers gave back some of their gains of the 
previous session while investors nervously awaited clues on further central bank stimulus.
Investors had pinned their hopes on the Federal Reserve introducing a new round of stimulus measures to aid 
economic recovery in the previous session, which helped push the FTSE 100 up 1.7 per cent on Tuesday. They 
were a little more cautious in early trade on Wednesday, however, and the FTSE 100 eased 0.2 per cent to 
5,576.19, a dip of 10 points.
"With the possibility of further stimulus seemingly priced in, there is scope for some disappointment as the FOMC 
members are far from unanimous in believing action is needed now," said Ian Williams at Peel Hunt.
Ahead of this, the minutes of the last Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee meeting were expected to reveal 
strong support for an extension of the Bank's asset purchase programme, although the MPC ultimately opted for no 
change at the meeting.
In early trade the FTSE 100 was led by broadcaster ITV, the focus of bid talk as KKR was said to be among a 
number of private equity group interested in the company. Shares in ITV were up 3.2 per cent to 76.65p.
There was bid interest lower down the market as London-listed shares of Ryanair climbed 1.2 per cent to 4.02p 
after the budget airline company restarted its pursuit of rival Aer Lingus with a EUR694m offer.
The mid-cap FTSE 250 was down 0.2 per cent to 10,853.15 in early trade as retailers gave back some of the 
previous session's strong gains.

Kesa Electricals fell 5.4 per cent to 52.25p after it reported a 42 per cent fall in underlying profit and announced a 
dividend cut. The company said it did not see any improvement in its markets in the near future.
Home Retail Group, which climbed nearly 24 per cent on Tuesday after reporting improving sales at its Argos chain, 
gave back 2.9 per cent to 89.2p.
Among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 were Severn Trent and United Utilities as shares in the two water 
companies traded without rights to the latest dividend payment. Severn Trent fell 5.7 per cent to £16.49 while

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary is never dull - and a new, out-of-the-blue EUR700m takeover offer for rival 
Irish-based carrier Aer Lingus on Tuesday evening was true to form. But while the 40 per cent premium being 
offered over Aer Lingus's undisturbed share price may seem appealing and the Irish government is under pressure 
to offload its 25 per cent holding as part of Ireland's bailout package, antitrust obstacles still look formidable.
European Union competition regulators blocked a merger five years ago because the two carriers were the most 
important operators on short-haul routes between Ireland and a slew of European destinations. Together, they 
carried 80 per cent of all intra-European passengers to and from once-congested Dublin airport.
Today, the two airlines are still the big players there, offering rival services to more than two dozen destinations. 
Ryanair now argues that ample spare capacity at Dublin - thanks to Celtic Tiger-era terminal expansion and post-
Celtic Tiger demand declines - means a barrier to new entrants has been lifted. Somehow, one suspects, 
competition officials in Brussels may take some persuading.

Ryanair has made an audacious third attempt at taking over Aer Lingus, Ireland's flag carrier.
The Irish low-cost carrier unveiled an all-cash offer of EUR1.3 per Aer Lingus share on Tuesday, valuing the 
airline's equity at EUR694m, or a 38.3 per cent premium to its closing stock price.
Since Aer Lingus's flotation in 2006, Ryanair has mounted two takeover bids for the flag carrier, but both failed after 
objections by the Irish government and the European Commission.
This week, the UK Competition Commission announced an investigation into Ryanair's 29.8 per cent stake in Aer 
Lingus because of concerns that the shareholding may be damaging competition.
Ryanair argued that circumstances had "changed materially" since its first unsuccessful bid for Aer Lingus in 2006, 
highlighting consolidation involving European flag carriers and the Irish government's plan to sell its 25 per cent 
stake.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue, said: "This offer represents a 
significant opportunity to combine Aer Lingus with Ryanair to form one strong Irish airline group capable of 
competing with Europe's other major airline groups led by Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa."
In an attempt to persuade the competition authorities to clear the new bid, Ryanair pitched its offer as "pro-
consumer". It proposed to run its low-cost carrier separately from Aer Lingus, to maintain the two brands.
Aer Lingus declined to comment on Ryanair's new bid.
Ryanair makes third bid for Aer Lingus
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Espirito Santo, said the antitrust issues may have moved in Ryanair's favour since 2006. 
"But it is far from clear Ryanair will be able to secure clearance from the authorities," he added.
Two analysts said the Irish government would probably reject Ryanair's new bid after declaring last year it would 
oppose the low-cost carrier buying the state's 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus. The government has held 
discussions about selling its stake to Etihad, the fast-growing Gulf carrier that in May announced it had bought a 3 
per cent stake in Aer Lingus.
Ryanair has been engaged in an acrimonious confrontation with Aer Lingus, demanding payment of a dividend and 
complaining about several issues including the pension scheme, which has a large deficit.
In May, Aer Lingus announced it would pay a dividend for the first time since its flotation.
Aer Lingus reported revenue of EUR1.3bn for the year to December 31, up 6 per cent, and pre-tax profit of 
EUR84.4m, compared to EUR27.2m in 2010.

Ryanair may be forced to sell its minority stake in Aer Lingus after a decision by the Office of Fair Trading to refer 
the matter to the Competition Commission.
The UK's main antitrust agency said on Friday that Ryanair's 29.8 per cent stake in its rival might provide it with 
material influence over Aer Lingus's commercial policy.
"There is a realistic prospect that its stake has resulted, or will result in, a substantial lessening of competition on a 
number of Ryanair and/or Aer Lingus routes between the UK and Ireland," the OFT said in a statement.
The watchdog began an inquiry in 2010 to determine whether Ryanair's purchase of a 29.8 per cent stake in Aer 
Lingus would lead to a substantial lessening in competition for consumers in the UK.
Ryanair challenged the decision to conduct the inquiry to the Court of Appeal but lost its case last month.
This has enabled the OFT to make the referral to the Competition Commission.
The commission, unlike the OFT, has the power to order companies to divest a minority stake if it finds that these 
enable the owner to influence the behaviour and policies of a target company in a way that harms competition.

When Poland joined the EU in 2004, it brought the liberty Poles had been waiting for since the fall of communism in 
1989: the freedom to live abroad, and get there affordably.
An estimated 1m Poles emigrated to the UK and Ireland. Many have been commuting back to Poland ever since - 
for everything from good value dental care to better summer weather.
Thousands of others flit back and forth, working a few months abroad, then flying home. Europe's low-fare airlines - 
Ryanair, Budapest-headquartered Wizz Air, and others - have been the biggest beneficiaries of this migration.
The competition has proved to be an enormous challenge to Poland's lossmaking flag carrier, Lot Polish Airlines, 
which last year carried 4.6m passengers and posted a loss of 145.5m zlotys ($42m).
At a time when other central European carriers such as Hungary's Malev have gone bankrupt, Lot is fighting for 
survival, and the competition is growing.
The latest battle centres on the lucrative Warsaw market, Poland's largest with 9.3m passengers served in 2011, a 
7 per cent increase over 2010. Lot has long seen rivals such as Lufthansa siphoning well-heeled passengers from 
Warsaw to its own hubs.
Now it is likely to see a stronger challenge at the cheaper end of the market.
Ryanair pulled out of using Warsaw's Chopin airport in 2008 after a dispute over landing fees - Michael O'Leary, the 
airline's flamboyant chief executive, called it a "shocking airport".
Airlines: Competitors manage to fly rings round national carrier
Instead, the discount carrier put unpronounceable destinations on the map such as Bydgoszcz, Rzeszów and 
Wroclaw, its first Polish fleet base, tying secondary Polish cities directly to European destinations.
That approach contrasts with Lot's hub-and-spoke system based on Warsaw as its main airport for foreign flights. 
Lot now faces a renewed low-cost challenge, thanks in part to the infrastructure upgrades prompted by the Euro 
2012 football championship.
The tournament provided the impetus for Warsaw's long-awaited low-cost airport at Modlin, a former air force base 
around 40km north-west of the city centre.
Ryanair begins flights from Modlin on July 16, launching eight new routes it hopes will carry about 700,000 
passengers a year. Eleven more routes will be added in the autumn.
Wizz Air has also moved to Modlin, even though the old airport boasts a refurbished terminal and a new rail link 
some 20 minutes from the centre.
"Wizz Air is moving to Warsaw Modlin to get lower landing fees," says Przemyslaw Przybylski, spokesman for 
Warsaw Chopin.
"But that is fine, Warsaw Chopin helped establish Modlin exactly to cater for the low-cost airlines which were 
overcrowding our facilities, and we remain a shareholder in the new airport."
Lot also faces change. The treasury ministry, which owns 68 per cent of the carrier, is hoping to privatise it this 
year.
Plans to sell a 50 per cent stake to fast-growing Turkish Airlines fell through this month, largely over Turkish 
concerns that EU rules would prevent it from taking full control of Lot.
The treasury may end up privatising Lot through the Warsaw Stock Exchange, and there are also hopes that Air 
China may take an interest.
As privatisation nears, Lot has been struggling to improve its bottom line. The carrier's net loss has been declining 
while its passenger numbers have been rising at an annual rate of 9 per cent.
The airline says its load factor (a measure of efficiency) was more than 76 per cent last year, in line with many 
competitors, and Lot predicts an operating profit of 52.5m zlotys for 2012, which would be its first profit since 2007.
In November, Lot will be the first European airline to receive Boeing's new B787 Dreamliner, one of the most fuel-
efficient airliners in the sky.
It will serve Lot's routes between Poland and North America.
This suggests that, with Lot facing competition closer to home, it will steadily build its intercontinental network.
"Lot knows Europe is getting extremely competitive, but it could carve out a niche running long-haul flights," says 
Stephen Furlong, an airline analyst at Davy, an Irish brokerage.
"The arrival of the Dreamliner definitely makes that a possibility."
The rivalry close to home looks to be getting even fiercer.
OLT Express, a new Polish airline, began operating domestic routes in April. Aiming to compete with Lot's internal 
flights and Poland's slow intercity rail services, it has cheap prices and frequent flights.
"This is a big country, people are feeling wealthier all the time, and they are still unsatisfied with the roads and 
railways," says Jaroslaw Frankowski, OLT's managing director.
Airlines: Competitors manage to fly rings round national carrier
"Lot didn't believe me when I pitched them the idea two years ago that low-fare domestic flights make total sense in 
Poland. Now they're having to cut fares, and they don't have enough fleet to compete with us."

Ryanair was left behind by a London market rally on Wednesday on worries that falling oil prices may not translate 
into higher earnings.
Budget airlines have outperformed flag carriers this year because they fix a greater proportion of their fuel bills in 
advance, which gives them a competitive advantage, said JPMorgan Cazenove. "Falling fuel prices will likely have 
the opposite effect," it added,
Jet fuel was already trading at close to Ryanair's hedging price for 2013, having fallen 18 per cent in two months, 
according to the broker.
Yet Ryanair shares have risen 10.3 per cent over the past 12 months, compared with a 37 per cent drop for British 
Airways owner IAG. At £4.65bn, Ryanair's market valuation is nearly £2bn higher than IAG's.
"Ryanair and EasyJet are highly cyclical airlines, near 100 per cent exposed to Europe, with their biggest cost (fuel) 
outside of their control," said JPMorgan.
"Recent earnings performance is impressive [but] we believe sentiment has overshot and become too negative for 
the legacy carriers."
Ryanair's London-listed shares fell 1.3 per cent to EUR4.00 after JPMorgan downgraded the stock to 
"underweight". IAG rose 1.9 per cent to 144½p and EasyJet was up 2.5 per cent to 497p.
London market takes off without Ryanair
The wider market showed its biggest advance in six months, lifting the FTSE 100 by 2.4 per cent or 123.92 points to 
5,384.11.
Banks led the way, with Barclays surging 8.2 per cent to 187.8p. Royal Bank of Scotland, trading after a 10-for-one 
share consolidation, rose 6.7 per cent to 213.2p.
A Citigroup upgrade to "buy" led Man Group  to rally 7.1 per cent to 80.9p. A 19 per cent prospective dividend yield 
helped offset the risk of further earnings downgrades, it argued.
Citi set a 90p target on the hedge fund manager based on just 4 per cent growth in assets under management this 
year and no performance fee earnings from its flagship AHL fund until 2014. "For us to cut again, we would need to 
see negative returns and flows into 2013," Citi said. "This is unlikely, in our view."
Precious metals miners were also prominent among the risers as an agreement by G7 leaders to coordinate policy 
pushed gold to a four-week high.
Randgold Resources was up 7.7 per cent to £59.80, African Barrick Gold added 14.5 per cent to 400.2p and 
Centamin advanced 11.1 per cent to 72.4p.
RBC advised clients to buy gold producers as it said "the catalysts that triggered the 2011 gold price rallies are still 
in place". Central bank buying, the eurozone crisis and expectations of another round of quantitative easing in the 
US should mean gold will trade higher in the second half, it added.
Petropavlovsk gained 9.7 per cent to 425.6p after UBS added the Russian gold miner to its "buy" list.
While cost inflation would hurt earnings, the recent weakness in the rouble and a stronger short-term outlook for 
gold presented a sweet spot for the company, UBS said. The broker also noted a "rock bottom" valuation of 5.4 
times 2012 earnings, compared with 11.9 times earnings for the gold sector.
Premier Oil gained 7.4 per cent to 353.2p after announcing an oil discovery at the Carnaby exploration well in the 
North Sea, though volumes were towards the lower end of the guided range. It lifted two minority stakeholders in 
Carnaby, with Cairn Energy up 5 per cent to 289.7p and Nautical Petroleum  up 3.2 per cent to 269p.
Among the fallers, Tate & Lyle  lost 1.6 per cent to 643p as downgrades followed the ingredients maker's results 
last week.
Canaccord Genuity cut its earnings forecasts for the current year by around 7 per cent after a meeting with 
management, with the broker predicting corn price headwinds and weakness in macro-exposed industrial starch 
and US ethanol markets would restrain growth.
InterContinental Hotels slipped back 0.8 per cent to £14.70 following last week's spike, which came after activist 
investor Nelson Peltz declared a stake. InterContinental management was this week on a US roadshow.
Retailers slipped following a rain-disrupted Jubilee weekend, with Dixons Retail down 4.7 per cent to 12.8p and 
Argos owner Home Retail Group off 2.7 per cent to 71.5p.
Supergroup dropped 5 per cent to 285.9p following its ejection from the FTSE 250 index as part of the latest 
quarterly review.
Among small caps, newspaper publisher Mecom dived 48 per cent to 76p on a warning of weak advertising sales. 
Yell Group rose 5.7 per cent to 1.7p on a Citi upgrade to "hold."

Manchester airport warned on Wednesday of the likelihood of flight cancellations and delays after it ran out of 
aviation fuel for the first time ever.
Fuel storage tanks were emptied at 6pm on Wednesday but the airport said the disruption would be limited because 
supplies should be restored in the early hours of Thursday.
Manchester Airport Storage and Hydrant Company, the joint venture involving ExxonMobil and BP that supplies fuel 
at the airport, said "production-related issues" at the Essar refinery at Stanlow, near Ellesmere Port, had caused the 
disruption during the half-term school holiday.
The Essar refinery provides the majority of Manchester airport's aviation fuel by pipeline.
The refinery halted its supply to the airport on Tuesday afternoon after finding issues with the quality of some jet 
fuel.
Essar Oil UK, operator of the refinery, said on Wednesday afternoon that jet fuel production at Stanlow refinery was 
back to normal and it was resuming supply to Manchester airport.
About 150 flights are due to take off or land at Manchester airport between 6pm on Wednesday and 6am on 
Thursday and the airport said some could be affected by the disruption.
Lack of fuel threatens Manchester flights
The airport added that the fuel disruption was likely to last hours rather than days, saying: "While we do not expect 
this to cause widespread disruption, it is possible that some airlines may decide to cancel, divert or delay a small 
number of flights."
Ryanair said it did not expect flight cancellations but warned that some flights arriving at Manchester might be 
delayed because of the need to divert to other airports to take on fuel.

Boeing has expressed doubts that it can provide Ryanair with a 200-seat aircraft by removing the two toilets at the 
rear of the US manufacturer's 737 narrowbody jet.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, is keen to increase the number of seats on each of its Boeing 737-800s 
from 189 to 195 or more by having only one toilet at the front.
Jim Albaugh, head of Boeing's commercial aircraft division, described Ryanair as a "great customer" but said he did 
not think the jet certification authorities would allow the manufacturer to stop installing toilets at the back of the 737.

How many airlines does Europe need? Certainly not 40, providing 8.5 per cent more seat capacity in 2011 
compared with 2007. One theory says that the region could live with three flag carriers (Lufthansa, International 
Airlines Group and Air France-KLM), a couple of budget airlines (Ryanair and easyJet) and, perhaps, a few niche 
players. But while consolidation talk is plentiful, the actual pace of airline rationalisation remains fairly stately.
There are several reasons. Antitrust policies do not help - at least from an investor if not a passenger perspective. 
Of the four mergers blocked by European regulators over the past eight years, two have involved airlines: Ryanair's 
bid for Aer Lingus, and the proposed combination of Greek carriers Aegean and Olympic. Meanwhile, big flag 
carriers, faced with high fuel costs and depressed demand, have worries of their own, limiting capacity to absorb 
smaller fry. True, Lufthansa, in the throes of cost-cutting but with a solid balance sheet, has signalled tentative 
interest in Portugal's TAP. But IAG is still digesting Spain's Iberia and working through the BMI purchase. And Air 
France-KLM, long touted as a potential purchaser for Alitalia, needs to focus on its own restructuring. That leaves 
expansion-minded Middle East carriers, such as Etihad and Emirates. But they are more intent on bolstering their 
own operations than sorting out Europe's woes: Etihad's 29 per cent of Air Berlin, for example, provides access to a 
useful European feeder service.
Plainly, it would be helpful if smaller carriers could combine among themselves - an idea being discussed among 
Balkans airlines but yet to crystallise. Ultimately, though, credit withdrawal pressures may be required to achieve 
rationalisation. Last year, these pushed Malev and Spanair out of the skies. It could be an even tougher winter 
ahead.

Lot Polish Airlines is trying to find another potential buyer after Turkish Airlines announced that it was backing away 
from plans to buy the lossmaking carrier.
Several Turkish analysts said the news did not hit their expectations about Turkish Airlines, because they failed to 
see the benefits behind the planned acquisition.
"It didn't make sense for Turkish Airlines," said Efe Kalkandelen at IS Investment in Istanbul, arguing that the 
Turkish group had limited financial capacity for an acquisition.
Turkish Airlines is expanding rapidly due to organic growth, which is one of the reasons why its debt has increased 
in recent years. The airline says it now flies to more destinations from a single airport than any other European 
carrier.
The Turkish group had been interested in using Warsaw as a mini-hub to increase traffic and passengers at 
Istanbul - although Ataturk airport is already subject to rising congestion and delays.
"I won't deny that we were upset," Marcin Pirog, Lot chief executive, told Polish radio. "I have already talked to our 
Turkish partners who explained that their main reason for halting the negotiations was that after speaking to our 
lawyers they understood that they would not have factual control over the company."
Investors from outside the European Union cannot own a majority stake in EU airlines.
Turkish Airlines drops bid for Lot
The Polish Treasury, which owns 68 per cent of Lot, is looking to privatise the airline this year. A Polish delegation 
was in China last week as Lot resumed flights to the country, and there was hope that Air China would express 
interest in buying a stake in the Polish carrier. If no industry buyer can be found, the government has talked of 
floating the airline on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Other potential European partners like Lufthansa have not expressed interest in buying Lot, and the airline is facing 
a difficult future. Lufthansa siphons many Polish passengers to its German hubs; there is a new domestic airline, 
OLT Express, competing with Lot on local routes; and Ryanair, the Irish low-cost airline, is resuming flights to 
Warsaw after the opening of a new suburban airport later this month.
Other national airlines in the region are also in trouble, while Hungary's Malev went bankrupt earlier this year.
"We have to draw comparisons with Malev," said Aleksander Domaradzki, managing partner with DGL Polska, a 
transportation consultancy. "They went belly up and other airlines took their slots and I would guess that is the 
strategy other European airlines could have towards Lot."
Lot posted a loss of 145m zlotys ($41m) last year but expected a 52m zlotys profit for 2012.

The private equity group TPG and US Airways are in talks over a joint bid for AMR Corp, the parent company of 
American Airlines, according to people familiar with the situation.
American, the third-largest US carrier, filed for bankruptcy protection in November citing untenable labour costs. For 
US Airways, the fifth-largest carrier, working with TPG would add financial heft and an investment group with 
experience in the airline industry.
Discussions are at an early stage, any deal would be stuck once American exited the bankruptcy procedure and a 
possible partnership was just one of several options under consideration, according to people familiar with the 
situation.
The private equity group would be interested in a deal that provided the opportunity for operational improvement, 
rather than just straight financing, according to those people.
Rick Schifter, a managing partner at TPG, previously sat on the board of US Airways and David Bonderman, a TPG 
co-founder, is an experienced airline investor. He has been chairman of Ryanair for 15 years, even though the 
group no longer has a stake in the European budget airline.
TPG declined to comment. US Airways and AMR did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
AMR filed for bankruptcy protection in an attempt to reduce its debt burden and squeeze costs after losing ground 
to rivals for more than a decade after American shunned bankruptcy in the early 2000s and sat out the wave of 
consolidation that followed.
TPG and US Airways look at American tie-up
Under bankruptcy rules, AMR's management has an 18-month "exclusive period" in which the company can 
determine its own plan of reorganisation and can bat away proposals from third parties.
After that period, or once AMR has filed its standalone plan with the court, creditors can propose alternatives, 
possibly in conjunction with potential buyers.
Industry experts said they also expected United Continental and Delta Air Lines to look at the possibility of a bid for 
AMR. However, any bid would be subject to intense antitrust scrutiny after a series of mergers has left the industry 
highly consolidated.
US Airways, the smallest of the US's national carriers, has long been considered a logical merger partner for AMR 
and has been public in its support of further airline consolidation. AMR has previously dismissed talk of a tie-up 
while the company is still in bankruptcy.
The potential tie-up between TPG and US Airways was first reported by Reuters.
TPG has been known for investing in airlines since the private equity group took a stake in Continental Airlines in 
1993, helping to turn the company round and making significant profits in a sector better known for destroying the 
capital of optimistic investors.

BAA wins right to appeal over Stansted

BAA has won the right to appeal an order to sell Stansted airport in the first big break for the airport operator for two 
years in its fight against the original ruling.
BAA, which is owned by Spanish infrastructure group Ferrovial, went to the Court of Appeal on Monday seeking a 
chance to overturn a February decision by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) upholding a 2009 Competition 
Commission order that it sell Stansted, Gatwick and one of its Scottish airports.
An investigation by the commission had found that BAA's grip on airports in the south-east and Scotland stymied 
competition, hurting both airlines and travellers, and decided separate ownership of each of London's three biggest 
airports, as well as Scotland's two biggest airports, was an appropriate remedy.
BAA complied with the disposal order in the case of Gatwick, which it sold in late 2009, and Edinburgh, which was 
sold last month.
However, it has resisted selling Stansted, making multiple appeals since 2009 - including through a judicial review 
that year and an application to the Supreme Court in 2010.
It plans to argue in this latest appeal that the original ruling has been misinterpreted, and that Heathrow and 
Stansted compete with each other only to a limited extent. It will also contest the commission's approach to 
assessing the cost to BAA of a forced sale.
The company said on Monday: "We are pleased that permission to appeal has been granted and look forward to 
presenting our arguments before the Court of Appeal."
BAA wins right to appeal over Stansted
The Competition Commission said it looked forward to restating its case.
The Court of Appeal has not yet given a date for a hearing but a ruling is not expected before the autumn. If BAA is 
forced to sell, analysts predict a pricetag of at least £1bn, or 11 times Stansted's earnings last year. That is lower 
than the multiple Edinburgh commanded in part because Stansted is a regulated asset, limiting the airport's annual 
returns.
But Douglas McNeill, an analyst at Charles Stanley, pointed out that that was not Stansted's only problem: "It's a 
shrinking airport and the same is not true of Edinburgh."
The airport's declining traffic was one of BAA's reasons for arguing last year that circumstances had changed so 
significantly since the 2009 decision that the remedies should be adjusted.
Olivia Peters, an analyst with RBC Capital Management, said Monday's Court of Appeal ruling "does come as a bit 
of a surprise since BAA have already appealed and they lost it". She added: "Given Heathrow and Stansted do not 
compete with each other - they have a completely different customer base - it seems a fairer decision."
But Ryanair, Stansted's biggest customer, condemned the decision to hear BAA's appeal. "This seventh appeal will 
further delay the sale of Stansted, proving yet again that the BAA has no regard for passengers, competition or 
tourism as it attempts to retain its stranglehold over London traffic," it said.

Airport operators normally have a horror of delays. But more time in the departure lounge is just what BAA is hoping 
to win at the Royal Courts of Justice on Monday.
The UK's biggest airport owner is making its case for the right to appeal, for a second time, against a 2009 
Competition Commission ruling that it sell Stansted airport, arguing market conditions have changed since then. 
BAA says Stansted would not compete with Heathrow in today's market place, even if it was under a different 
ownership.
If granted, an appeal would be the company's last chance to hang on to an asset it has fought for years to keep. If 
rejected, however, London's third-biggest airport could change hands by the end of the summer, at a price analysts 
put at anywhere between £900m and £1.4bn.
The top of that range is set by Edinburgh Airport, which BAA's owner Ferrovial sold for almost 17 times earnings 
this spring in another regulator-ordered sale. That suggests this is not a bad time to sell an airport. But there are 
reasons to believe Stansted may trade for something closer to the multiple Ferrovial achieved for Gatwick in 2009: 
10 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
That is partly because, like Gatwick, Stansted is a regulated asset, meaning the fees it charges airlines and retailers 
are linked to the consumer price index. That hedge against inflation is one reason pension funds are expected to 
look closely at the opportunity. But it limits returns, too.
BAA returns to fight over Stansted
Stansted's biggest customer, Ryanair, could also prove a problem. The low-cost carrier constitutes three-quarters of 
traffic and insists it will fly from other bases if landing fees rise - which they would do if an owner wanted to drive 
volume growth through investment.
The trouble is that, with Stansted operating at only half capacity, increasing passenger traffic could prove an 
important part of any investment case, particularly if private equity is involved, seeking higher returns in a shorter 
period of time than other buyers might.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, has said he would consider joining a consortium bidding for the airport, 
but one banker who has worked on a number of airport deals thinks it would take a significant stake to induce him 
to prioritise Stansted's needs over his airline's: "Five per cent is not going to make Mr O'Leary behave."
Another drag on the selling price might have more to do with bidders than the airport itself - or rather, with the lack 
of one particular bidder. Global Infrastructure Partners, the world's biggest infrastructure-focused fund, was the 
victor in the contest for Edinburgh Airport. It also owns London City and Gatwick airports, and people close to the 
auction say the impressive multiple paid was probably justified in part by savings GIP thinks it could derive from 
owning multiple UK airports.
But it owns too many London airports to go for Stansted, too. One London-based analyst said GIP was willing to 
pay more for Edinburgh because it was better positioned than rivals to fund the transaction with debt. "The fact that 
GIP aren't bidding will probably mean the multiple will be lower because others wouldn't necessarily have access to 
the sort of debt financing they do," he said.
Still, some of Stansted's woes could be overplayed, including the possibility that Ryanair would pull a significant 
number of routes if it saw fees rise. A lack of London alternatives could stymie that plan, the analyst added.
Nor is uncertainty surrounding the UK's aviation policy necessarily a big consideration, argues Douglas McNeill at 
Charles Stanley. Options the government may consider include expanding Heathrow - which would require an 
awkward about-face - building a hub in the Thames Estuary, or making better use of the capital's other airports. The 
latter could inflate future returns for Stansted; but the government does not plan to choose a path until next spring.
Even so, Mr McNeill would not advocate delay for the sake of delay. Should BAA be forced to sell, he forecasts a 
pricetag of at least £1bn, or 12 times ebitda. "I don't see much reason to think that things will get better," he says. "I 
think they might even get worse."

As Europe continued its slow-motion disintegration, many companies were busy getting together. US industrial 
group Eaton made the biggest move of the week with an $11.8bn offer for Cooper Industries as it tried to transform 
itself into a power management powerhouse. A smaller deal is at the centre of a humdinger of a battle between 
Shell and Thailand's PTT for the Mozambican offshore gas assets of Cove Energy. By contrast Accor, Europe's 
largest hotel operator, seems to be in permanent restructuring mode, selling its US Motel 6 chain to Blackstone for 
$1.9bn.
However, most of the action was in the TMT sector. German software company SAP sought to boost its presence in 
cloud computing with a $4.3bn offer for US business-to-business ecommerce network Ariba. In the media sector, 
China's largest owner of cinemas, Dalian Wanda, tried to buy in Hollywood knowhow with a $2.6bn bid for AMC 
Entertainment. Meanwhile Yahoo and Chinese ecommerce company Alibaba were unwinding their alliance as the 
latter bought back half of the US internet company's 40 per cent stake for $7.1bn. Also in the tech sector, HP 
admitted to a failure of execution in its $10bn acquisition of UK enterprise search company Autonomy, and Dell 
struggled to adapt to the rapid decline of the PC business as low-end competitors such as Lenovo eat into its 
profits.
Pressures of a different kind dominated the skies as Australian airline Qantas split its international and domestic 
businesses, and Europe's biggest airline, Ryanair, has moved shrewdly to gain market share as the industry 
consolidates. In the UK, Vodafone turned out largely flat results while both Burberry and SABMiller benefited from 
growth in emerging markets. The contrast between a stagnant Europe and dynamic emerging markets is as stark 
as ever.

Air France on Thursday confirmed for the first time that it would be cutting staff as part of a restructuring plan that is 
intended to restore the French flag carrier to profit.
Alexandre de Juniac, Air France's chief executive, briefed trade unions on a proposed restructuring that would 
involve splitting the airline's lossmaking short and medium-haul operations into three new units.
The Air France-KLM group is struggling with high operating costs and a large debt load and last year reported a net 
loss of EUR809m. While the group's challenges are more serious than its main peers, Lufthansa and International 
Airlines Group are also seeking to improve their short-haul operations because of strong competition from low-cost 
carriers led by Ryanair and easyJet.
IAG, parent of British Airways and Iberia, last year created a new low-cost airline in Spain. This year, Lufthansa is 
seeking to reduce duplication between its short-haul point-to-point operations and Germanwings, its low-cost 
carrier.
"It has been confirmed that Air France has excess staff," said Air France, adding that proposals on headcount 
reduction would be made next month following further talks with the unions. It employs 55,000 people.
The restructuring of Air France's short and medium-haul operations is likely to be contentious, partly because 
François Hollande, France's newly elected Socialist president, made preserving jobs a central part of his election 
campaign.
Air France to slash staff numbers
Mr de Juniac said Air France was being placed "on the path to profitable growth ... in a context of extremely fierce 
international competition".
Air France is seeking to persuade pilots and cabin crew at its short-haul operations to work longer for the same pay 
as part of a EUR2bn cost savings programme. Productivity is supposed to improve 20 per cent by 2015.
Under the restructuring, the first of Air France's short and medium-haul units will focus on feeding the airline's hub 
at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. Air France's long-haul operations are based there.
The second unit will concentrate on regional services and Air France is considering having minority investors in the 
business.
The third unit will be Transavia France, Air France's low-cost carrier that focuses on holiday destinations, and its 
operations are due to be expanded. Pilots and cabin crew at Transavia France work longer hours compared with 
their colleagues at Air France.

Ryanair could be forced to sell its minority stake in rival Irish airline Aer Lingus following a decision by the UK Court 
of Appeal to allow competition authorities to investigate whether the shareholding is damaging competition.
The Office of Fair Trading began an inquiry in 2010 to determine if Ryanair's purchase of a 29.8 per cent stake in 
Aer Lingus would lead to a substantial lessening in competition for consumers in the UK. It is investigating whether 
Ryanair can use its minority stake to influence the behaviour of Aer Lingus, thereby harming competition in the UK 
market where both airlines have substantial operations.
Ryanair challenged the decision to conduct the inquiry to the Court of Appeal, arguing the OFT had not begun its 
investigation within the required timeframe. On Tuesday the court rejected Ryanair's appeal, enabling the 
competition investigation, which was suspended while the court challenge was heard, to resume.
The OFT welcomed the ruling, saying it would decide whether to refer Ryanair's acquisition of the shares to the 
Competition Commission within 15 days.
The Competition Commission has the power to order companies to divest a minority stake if it finds they enable the 
owner to influence the behaviour and policies of a target company in a way that harms competition.
Ryanair said it would appeal the court's ruling to the Supreme Court.
"Ryanair's lawyers will immediately apply to appeal today's ruling to the UK Supreme Court and will be seeking a 
suspension of any OFT investigation pending an outcome of this Supreme Court appeal," said the company.
Ryanair appeal on Aer Lingus probe rejected
Ryanair began acquiring its 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus in 2006 and made a bid to take over its smaller Irish 
rival later that year. The European Commission blocked the takeover bid in June 2007. However, it did not force 
Ryanair to dispose of its minority stake, saying it did not have de facto or de jure control in Aer Lingus.
Aer Lingus said it welcomed the court ruling and called for the Competition Commission to force Ryanair to sell its 
stake in the airline.
"It is unacceptable that our principal competitor has been allowed to remain as a significant shareholder on our 
share register even though the European Commission blocked their hostile takeover almost five years ago," said 
Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus chief executive.
In 2010 BSkyB was forced to sell 10 per cent of a 17.9 per cent minority stake that it held in ITV when the 
Competition Commission found the shareholding would give rise to a substantial lessening of competition.

To describe Europe as having too much airline capacity would be an understatement. The existence of 40 airlines 
flying intra-region, many with market shares of less than 1 per cent, is a luxury the recession-hit area can ill-afford. 
So as cost pressures intensify, demand remains constrained and the ability of cash-strapped governments to 
support these carriers ebbs, consolidation looks inevitable.
The challenge for solvent carriers is to take advantage. So far, Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline by market 
capitalisation, has moved shrewdly. It seized on Malev's demise by opening a new Budapest base within weeks 
and deploying some of its winter-grounded fleet there. Similar expansion in Spain after Spanair's collapse has 
elevated Barcelona into one of its top four bases. Michael O'Leary, chief executive, predicts more of the same next 
winter. In short, market share gains should make Ryanair's 4-5 per cent annual growth objective amply achievable.
Profits are another matter - and Ryanair shares have fallen 11 per cent over the past week as the focus has shifted 
to the 2012/13 outlook. Monday's company predictions were so-so on the cost front: an extra EUR320m on the 
2012/13 fuel bill was much as expected, with flat costs elsewhere. But expectations of a mere 3 per cent increase in 
fares, after a 16 per cent rise in the year to March 2012, did surprise. True, Ryanair has been cautious before: a 
year ago, it steered towards after-tax profits in 2011/12 of EUR400m but has delivered EUR503m. That may make 
investors sceptical about 2012/13 guidance of a net EUR400m-EUR440m (20 per cent below consensus numbers). 
Even so, Ryanair shares, on a historic multiple of 11.5 times, do not look particularly cheap compared, say, with 
easyJet's 10 times 2012 multiple, even allowing for the former's record and solid balance sheet. No need to rush to 
check in.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, has warned profits will fall this year because of the ongoing uncertainty 
in the eurozone and high fuel prices.
The low-cost Irish airline on Monday reported record full-year net income of EUR503m compared with EUR401m 
last year, but said tough trading conditions would result in lower profits this year.
"We expect recession, austerity, currency concerns and lower fares at new and growing bases in Hungary, Poland, 
provincial UK and Spain will make it difficult to repeat this year's record results," said Mr O'Leary, who added that 
the airline was guiding net profit in the current year to fall back to between EUR400m and EUR440m.
The airline predicted further failures in the sector following the closures this year of Malev of Hungary, Spainair of 
Catalonia, Cimber Sterling of Denmark. BMI Baby, recently bought by International Airlines Group, is also 
threatened with closure.
Ryanair still plans to push ahead with expanding its fleet of Boeing 737-800 aircraft from 294 at the end of March to 
305 over the current financial year, in spite of a decision to ground 80 of its jets during the winter in response to 
higher fuel costs and limited passenger demand.
Total revenues at Ryanair rose nearly a fifth from EUR3.63bn to EUR4.39bn in the year to March 31, as its average 
fare rose 16 per cent and traffic climbed 5 per cent. But in spite of hedging, fuel costs rose from EUR1.23bn to 
EUR1.59bn, representing 43 per cent of turnover.
Ryanair warns profits set to fall
Pre-tax profits rose from EUR421m to EUR633m, generating net income of EUR503m - ahead of previous profits 
forecasts which were raised in February from EUR440m ($577m) to EUR480m.
Mr O'Leary used Ryanair's annual results to again court controversy with robust attacks on European competition 
authorities.
Last month Brussels opened its 18th investigation into whether Ryanair benefits from illegal state subsidies to 
airports with a probe into deals struck by the carrier with Nîmes airport in France, which have allegedly given the 
airline "undue economic advantage".
On Monday, the carrier said: "DG Comp [Directorate General for Competition] is determined to pursue its misguided 
vendetta against Ryanair and our regional airports."
It added: "While DG Comp wastes time and money trying to limit the growth of traffic and jobs at these regional 
airports, it continues to ignore its own failure to require flag carrier airlines, to repay unlawful state aid in cases   
where the EU has ruled that illegal state aid was received."
Ryanair's continuing fight against laws obliging it to feed and lodge airline customers stranded by the 2010 volcanic 
ash cloud was dealt a blow by the European Court of Justice in March with an opinion from the court's advocate-
general against Ryanair's argument that its liability was limited. A final judgment has yet to be delivered.
Shares in Ryanair, up 7 per cent on the year, fell 22 cent 22 to EUR3.80 on Monday morning.

Much of Europe's aviation industry is caught in a vortex of seemingly-endless restructuring. No matter how much 
legacy airlines adapt, by the time they have reshaped, their operating environment has altered again, and new 
threats have emerged.
The 3,500 job cuts unveiled by Lufthansa on May 3 come against a dark horizon. The airline lost EUR381m in the 
first quarter of 2012. It expects an operating profit for the year, but is shedding 3 per cent of employees as part of a 
EUR1.5bn, three-year cost-cutting programme.
Air France-KLM has also launched a restructuring drive, designed to slash ex-fuel unit costs by 10 per cent, after a 
net loss of EUR809m in 2011.
And International Airlines Group (IAG) is seeking more work for less pay at its main Spanish arm Iberia, after 
winning a productivity deal at British Airways, newly enlarged by a takeover of former rival BMI which added take-off 
and landing slots at London's Heathrow.
Restructuring experts say Europe has too many airlines, competing in an imperfect market distorted by state 
involvement. They also face higher costs from dearer fuel, at a time of intensifying competition.
Airline profit margins tend to be slim. But the International Air Transport Association (Iata) forecasts that while those 
in Asia, North America, Latin America and the Middle East are likely to remain profitable in 2012 unless oil prices 
spike higher, European airlines collectively will lose EUR600m.
Airlines: Flying into area of high pressure
Roger de Peyrecave, leader of the airlines team at PwC, says: "A lot of pressures are converging on Europe's 
airlines in 2012 and beyond".
Partial liberalisation of the European Union aviation market has enabled low-cost airlines, led by Ryanair and 
easyJet, to undercut rivals on short and medium-haul routes.
Now fares on long-haul routes are under pressure from restructured North American carriers, and highly-efficient 
airlines based in the Arabian Gulf.
Gulf airlines, by operating only large, fuel-efficient wide body aircraft, benefit from low costs and have operating 
bases handily located midway between Europe and Asia.
Historically, the leading European former flag carriers used profits from long-haul routes to subsidise the short-haul 
flights that bring passengers to and from their long-haul hubs.
But as long-haul fares come under pressure, European carriers must try to reach the highest levels of efficiency on 
each kind of route they operate.
Philipp Goedeking, a managing director and aviation expert at corporate turnround specialist AlixPartners, says: "A 
big, and very rapid change, is going on in the European aviation market".
He identifies three main kinds of carrier among roughly 500 airlines in Europe.
The big full-service carriers have the scale to achieve efficiencies, but need to cut costs.
Partly because of historic agreements, they often pay higher salaries for lower productivity from staff than the 
second group, their big short and medium-haul low-cost rivals.
The third group comprises midsized flag carriers and a number of newish privately owned airlines. "There are many 
small unprofitable low-cost carriers, which in reality may be low-fare but certainly not low-cost," he says. "Airlines 
are scale-driven."
The difficulties of some of these under-scale companies, in a market where the European Commission is a vigilant 
opponent of state aid, are readily apparent. Two airlines, Spanair, backed by the state of Catalonia, and Malev, 
Hungary's state airline, have collapsed this year.
LOT in Poland and CSA Czech Airlines are among state airlines that are simultaneously striving to improve 
efficiency and find a partner.
Advisers and consultants are working with many companies to find a way forward.
Restructuring airlines is complicated, Mr Goedeking says. "You have to work with governments, renegotiate 
incentives, explore alliances and consolidation opportunities, and - in parallel - cut all possible costs."
Bigger carriers usually have only one reason to buy their smaller brethren. "You never buy an airline; you buy 
access to a market," Mr Goedeking says.
Buying and closing airlines within Europe removes rivals and triggers competition concerns.
This year, Etihad, a fast-growing Gulf carrier, lifted its stake in Air Berlin to 29 per cent and acquired a near-3 per 
cent stake in Aer Lingus of Ireland.
Tanja Wielgoss, head of aviation activities in central Europe for AT Kearney, a consultancy, says: "This is a first 
sign of the way things may go.
"Instead of negotiating traffic rights with each of the European states, Etihad now has access to a Europe-wide 
feeder service for its Abu Dhabi hub."
Airlines: Flying into area of high pressure
If Europe's big legacy carriers are to respond effectively, they need a new vision that their employees, who are 
often asked to work harder for less money, can share, she says.
"Moreover, their almost exclusive focus on the bottom line may not be enough in times when the business model is 
fundamentally challenged."
To thrive, European carriers will need to understand and provide what customers like, and are willing to pay for, she 
says.
But Ms Wielgoss also thinks governments should get out of the way. "It is time for national states to tear down the 
old system of traffic rights," she says.
"Passengers would benefit if there were real economies of scale. Travellers would be able to choose between 
clearly defined services and standards."

Air travellers whose flights are delayed by three hours or more have a right to compensation from airlines, 
according to a top European Court of Justice official.
The non-binding opinion by Yves Bot, advocate-general to the court, comes in response to a case brought by 
British Airways, easyJet, Tui Travel and the main industry body, and another by passengers against Lufthansa over 
a flight from Lagos to Frankfurt that landed more than a day after its scheduled arrival.
The UK airlines and Lufthansa are both challenging a 2009 ruling by the court that, in terms of compensation, 
passengers who experience significant delays should be treated in the same way as those whose flights are 
cancelled. Under that decision -"Sturgeon and Others" - passengers are entitled to between EUR250 and EUR600 
depending on the distance of the flights they booked.
Explaining one of the sector's concerns Gerald Khoo, an analyst with Espirito Santo, said: "The selling of an airline 
ticket seems to open up a contingent liability larger than the fare."
British Airways, a division of International Airlines Group, and Tui cautioned on Tuesday that Mr Bot's opinion did 
not constitute a final decision. However, the court often rules in line with the advocate-general's recommendations.
BA said: "The European Court of Justice ruling regarding the Sturgeon case in November 2009 has come under 
criticism from many parties and we also believe the ruling was wrong."
Airlines lose EU legal ruling
The UK airlines had sought assurances from the UK's Civil Aviation Authority that the regulator would not interpret 
EU passenger-protection regulations introduced in 2004 as obligations on the airlines to compensate delayed 
customers. When the CAA refused, the airlines took their request to the UK High Court, which referred it to the ECJ.
But Mr Bot wrote in his decision that the airlines had raised "nothing new which might call into question the 
interpretation that the court gave of those provisions in [the Sturgeon and Others case]".
The opinion is the second blow this spring delivered by Mr Bot to the industry, after he said in March that Ryanair 
should have paid for the room and board for a customer stranded by the 2010 volcanic ash cloud over northern 
Europe.
However, airlines could get some relief from these obligations if a review of the 2004 regulations swings their way. 
Launched last year by Siim Kallas, Europe's transport commissioner, and prompted in part by the ash cloud 
disruption, the review is examining "limitation of liability" for airlines, with an eye to passing on some responsibilities 
for passengers to governments.

Christoph Franz is seeking to bring some order to the sprawling empire created by his predecessors.
Lufthansa's chief executive is busy selling assets and cutting costs at Europe's largest airline by revenue after it 
slipped to a EUR13m net loss in 2011, his first year in charge.
The eurozone crisis, high fuel costs and intense competition all took their toll on the company last year, as well as 
regulatory decisions led by the ban on night flights at Frankfurt airport, the German airline's cargo and passenger 
hub.
"The night flight ban - that is the German equivalent of not creating a third runway in Heathrow," says Mr Franz, in a 
light-hearted but ultimately serious comparison with how the UK government has angered British airlines by 
refusing to allow runway expansion at London's Heathrow airport.
While Mr Franz is powerless to overturn the night flight ban at Frankfurt that will reduce Lufthansa's annual earnings 
by EUR40m, he is starting to take some drastic steps to improve profitability.
BMI British Midland, the loss-making UK airline that Lufthansa took control of in 2009, was sold last month to 
International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways.
BMI has struggled on multiple fronts, and Lufthansa blamed the EUR199m operating loss at its UK subsidiary last 
year for pushing the group into the red.
Lufthansa loss brings change in the air
Mr Franz insists Lufthansa was always going to find it difficult to mount a strong challenge to IAG at Heathrow - 
even though BMI has the second largest portfolio of take-off and landing slots at the capacity-constrained airport 
after BA.
"Though it's an important portfolio, it's still too small with regard to market share," he says.
He should know when to cut and run because the 52-year-old is well-versed in restructuring. He was involved in 
Lufthansa's turnround following the first Gulf war, when he served in the office of Jurgen Weber, the then chief 
executive.
In 2004 he became chief executive of Swiss International Air Lines, where he cut costs before its acquisition by 
Lufthansa.
The restructuring now being implemented at Austrian Airlines, which Lufthansa bought in 2009, has parallels with 
what happened at Swiss.
Austrian ran up a EUR62m operating loss in 2011, and the airline's pilots were told last month that they must 
transfer to Tyrolean Airways, a regional airline controlled by the Austrian flag carrier.
The pilots face having to work longer hours and are being asked to switch from attractive final salary pensions to 
less lucrative defined-contribution schemes.
But Mr Franz's restructuring skills may well find their severest test in Lufthansa's home market of Germany.
Air Berlin, easyJet and Ryanair, the low-cost carriers, are encroaching on Lufthansa's short-haul routes, while Gulf 
airlines led by Emirates are putting pressure on long-distance flights between Germany and Asia.
Mr Franz is seeking to fight back against the budget airlines by stripping out duplication between Lufthansa's point-
to-point short-haul services and Germanwings, the group's German low-cost carrier, which recorded a EUR52m 
operating loss in 2011.
With greater coordination, he is hoping the group can maximise profitability through Lufthansa's premium fares and 
Germanwings' low-cost structure. If not, he suggests Lufthansa could decide to abandon its premium brand 
positioning on short-haul routes.
This decision may be accelerated by the likely rejuvenation of Air Berlin, the loss-making German airline which last 
year secured Etihad, the deep-pocketed Abu Dhabi carrier, as its largest investor.
Mr Franz complains that Lufthansa is not competing on a level playing field with the Gulf carriers, highlighting how 
these state-controlled airlines benefit from government-funded hub airport infrastructure.
But he sees little or no chance of any redress. "The [European] airlines are fairly weak to defend their interests," he 
says.
While he may have to spend much of his time improving Lufthansa's efficiency in the face of a competitive 
onslaught, Mr Franz is keen not to be seen as a simple cost cutter.
He says he is willing to consider deals, albeit in a more cautious manner than his predecessors, and will examine 
the case for buying Transportes Aéreos Portugueses, the Portuguese carrier that is a leading European provider of 
flights to Brazil.
"Buying airlines is . . . exciting," he says. "I do not perceive myself in [the role] of a pure cost cutter."

International Airlines Group reported a worse than expected first-quarter operating loss of EUR249m, and warned 
that it would only break even in 2012 because of high fuel costs and the weak European economic environment.
IAG, created last year from the merger of British Airways and Iberia, also said its 2012 profitability would be hit by 
EUR240m of operating losses and restructuring charges at BMI British Midland, the UK airline bought from 
Lufthansa last month.
The group separately signalled it would not back down from plans to cut costs at Iberia, in spite of strong opposition 
from pilots. In early morning trading, IAG's shares were down almost 3 per cent at 158.4p.
IAG reported revenue of EUR3.9bn for the three months to March 31, up 7.8 per cent on a pro forma basis 
compared with the same period last year.
But IAG's operating loss before exceptional items rose from EUR102m a year ago to EUR249m in the first quarter 
of 2012, driven by a 24.9 per cent increase in fuel costs. The loss before tax was EUR263m, compared with 
EUR47m one year ago.
IAG said the outlook for 2012 involved several uncertainties, including the deteriorating Spanish economy, the 
prospect of a EUR1bn increase in fuel costs compared with 2011, and the impact of the BMI acquisition.
Such uncertainties meant that "IAG expects its operating [profit] result to be around break even level for the full 
year, after exceptional items".
IAG warns on annual profits
IAG expects to absorb EUR150m of operating losses at BMI this year. There will also be a EUR90m restructuring 
charge as BMI is integrated with BA.
In what is typically a weak quarter for many airlines, BA and Iberia reported operating losses of £62m and 
EUR170m respectively.
However, while BA benefited from strong demand for transatlantic air travel, Iberia suffered from the Spanish 
recession.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, also highlighted how strikes by pilots at Iberia had cost EUR25m in the first 
quarter.
The pilots oppose Iberia Express, Iberia's new low-cost carrier that is supposed to provide stronger competition for 
easyJet and Ryanair, although the strikes were called off when the government referred the dispute to arbitration 
last month.
Mr Walsh signalled he would not retreat from Iberia Express, saying: "Iberia's performance reflects the weakness of 
the Spanish domestic market and industrial action by pilots opposed to actions by Iberia's management to improve 
the airline's efficiencies."
Douglas McNeill, analyst at Charles Stanley, said IAG's "second year [of operation] is going to be much less good 
than its first, with a billion-euro hike in the fuel bill overshadowing everything else".
He said the projected losses at BMI were higher than expected, adding his 2012 forecasts may have to be reduced.

International Airlines Group reported a worse than expected first-quarter operating loss of EUR249m, and expects 
only to break even in 2012 because of high fuel costs and charges relating to its acquisition of BMI British Midland.
IAG, created last year from the merger of British Airways and Iberia, said its 2012 profitability would be hit by 
EUR240m of operating losses and restructuring charges at BMI, the UK airline bought from Lufthansa last month.
The group separately signalled it would not back down from plans to cut costs at Iberia, in spite of strong opposition 
from pilots. IAG's shares were down almost 3 per cent at 158.4p in early London tradingf.
IAG reported revenue of EUR3.9bn for the three months to March 31, up 7.8 per cent on a pro forma basis 
compared with the same period last year.
But IAG's operating loss before exceptional items rose from EUR102m a year ago to EUR249m in the first quarter 
of 2012, driven by a 24.9 per cent increase in fuel costs. The loss before tax was EUR263m, compared with 
EUR47m one year ago.

IAG expects to absorb EUR150m of operating losses at BMI this year. There will also be EUR90m of restructuring

IAG bought BMI because it is the second largest holder of take-off and landing slots at London's capacity 
constrained Heathrow airport. The acquisition should also enable BA to expand its long-haul operations into 
emerging markets.

EasyJet, the budget carrier, narrowed interim pre-tax losses following a milder European winter and less industrial 
action, despite higher fuel costs.
The no-frills airline on Wednesday attributed "exceptionally low levels of flight disruptions" to its shortening of first-
half pre-tax losses from £153m to £112m year-on-year, in spite of a £100m jump in fuel costs.
The airline's ability to push through higher ticket prices to cash-strapped consumers, as well as increase checked 
baggage and administration fees, drove up easyJet's average revenue per seat 11.9 per cent year-on-year to 
£50.47.
However, an extra £100m of fuel costs combined with increased staff and aircraft maintenance expenses pushed 
up the total cost per seat 7.4 per cent to £54.34.
"We expect the price of oil to remain high for some time, and continue to be a challenge," said Carolyn McCall, 
easyJet chief executive.
Over the past few years, Europe's airlines have been hurt by severe winter weather, industrial action by air traffic 
controllers and the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland.
The Luton-based carrier said the mild winter and less industrial action had cut the number of flight cancellations and 
overnight delays almost 90 per cent year-on-year, saving easyJet £15m.
Easyjet interim losses narrow
"It is important to appreciate that this was an exceptionally good result, and in the event of 'normal' winter weather 
in the future, levels of disruption would be higher," easyJet said.
In the six months to March 31, total group revenues rose to £1.47bn, compared with £1.27bn a year ago and the 
basic loss per share narrowed from 26.6p to 21.2p.
EasyJet, Europe's second-largest discount carrier by market capitalisation behind Ryanair, has traditionally 
reported losses over the slower winter period.
It usually offsets this by increasing capacity during the profitable summer vacation season.
The number of passengers carried in the first half rose by 5.4 per cent to 25.2m, while the load factor - a key 
measure of how well an airline fills its aircraft - edged up 1.5 percentage points to 86.9 per cent.
"Compared with our estimates, revenue was stronger than expected and other costs worse than our forecasts but 
otherwise the performance was broadly as we had expected," said Gerald Khoo at Espírito Santo.
EasyJet shares, which have risen more than one-third over the past year, on Wednesday rose 2.5 per cent, or 
12.5p, to 521.5p in early London trading.

Laws of aerodynamics demand that forward forces offset drag for flight to be possible. Executives at easyJet seem 
to have taken the lesson on board. In spite of a 26 per cent increase in first-half fuel costs - an extra £100m, year-
on-year - the low-cost carrier posted a sharply reduced pre-tax loss of £112m, down from a £153m deficit in the first 
six months of 2011. True, this was helped by a much milder winter and so reduced weather-related costs: lost flight 
segments were about one-10th of the previous year's figure. But revenue per seat was almost 12 per cent higher, 
while seat numbers nudged up 3.5 per cent. Result: a near-16 per cent jump in revenues.
The path ahead remains tricky, though. The second half last year saw changes to booking fees, priority boarding 
and bag charges, so revenue comparisons will become tougher. Competitor capacity, which was well-constrained 
over the winter, could become slightly less disciplined. And on the cost front, the London Olympics may cause 
airspace congestion, compounding the continuing fuel pressures. That said, with about half its summer seats sold, 
the company thinks revenue per seat will be up by the "low to mid-single digits". EasyJet also continues to woo 
cost-conscious business travellers (now one-fifth of its customer base). Frequencies have been stepped up on 
routes such as Paris-Milan and London-Amsterdam, while new regional bases at Nice and Toulouse look like a 
timely bid for Air France trade given impending restructuring at the French carrier.
So the question for investors is whether easyJet can keep up the pace. Its shares, at a two-year high, have had a 
strong run, so profit-taking could occur. But easyJet trades on 11 times estimated earnings for 2012 and under 10 
times for 2013, compared with 13.5 (2012 consensus) for low-cost rival Ryanair. The altitude is not demanding.

Aditya Ghosh, the youthful president of IndiGo, says there is no big secret behind the success of India's only 
profitable airline in an infamously difficult aviation market.
When asked how the no-frills carrier manages to make money while its rivals bleed red ink thanks to extortionate 
taxes, high fuel prices and fierce price competition, Mr Ghosh simply says: "We stick to the basics."
"We don't try to do anything fancy, we don't try to bend the wind, we just stick to our business model," the 36-year-
old executive says from his cramped office at company headquarters in the New Delhi suburb of Gurgaon. "We fly 
our planes on time; the flying experience is neat; and our fares are consistently lower than our competitors."
Analysts tend to agree with his assessment. They say that in contrast to Kingfisher Airlines, the debt-laden carrier 
struggling to avoid bankruptcy, privately held IndiGo has followed the strategy of Southwest Airlines in the US and 
Europe's Ryanair: offer only low-cost fares connecting busy destinations using just one type of plane.
"In terms of operations IndiGo is by far the best airline in India," says Sharan Lillaney, aviation analyst at Angel 
Broking. "It's definitely on track to become the Indian Southwest but it will have to prove itself over time."
The president of the five-year-old carrier, owned by Rahul Bhatia, an Indian billionaire, and Rakesh Gangwal, the 
US Airways former chief executive, says that keeping things simple in a crowded field of seven airlines including the 
subsidised national carrier is not easy.
"'Sticking to the basics' sounds obvious but it is surprising how many airlines in the world, including in India, stray 
from these basics," says Mr Ghosh.
IndiGo soars as Indian rivals struggle
Analysts say the quality of IndiGo's in-flight services and the chic PanAm-style of its cabin crew uniforms have 
given the young carrier an edge over rivals by bolstering its perception as a premium brand despite being a low-
cost operator.
This has helped IndiGo win over many business travellers who have tended to prefer Jet Airways, the country's 
largest full-service operator, and Air India, the state-run flag carrier, reckons Mr Ghosh.
Figures from India's directorate general of civil aviation show that IndiGo's on-time performance is the best in the 
country, with 96 per cent of its New Delhi and Mumbai flights landing on schedule.
Jet Airways trails with 84 per cent of its flights on the same key routes - the country's busiest - landing on time while 
Kingfisher gets just 59 per cent of it flights to their destination on schedule.
That performance has helped turn IndiGo, which has been profitable in each of the past four years, into the 
country's largest carrier by market share despite having a smaller fleet than its competitors. Net profit rose to 
Rs6.5bn in the year ended March 2011, compared with Rs5.5bn a year earlier.
With 56 aircraft serving 26 destinations across India it controls 21.9 per cent of the passenger market, the same 
share as Jet Airways, which has close to 100 planes over about 60 routes.
"We want to expand," says Mr Ghosh, "but we are going to do it slowly," sticking to the no-frills model.
IndiGo last year ordered 180 Airbus A320 jets worth $15.6bn - the second largest single order in the commercial 
aviation industry. Mr Ghosh says that while some of these planes will be used to fly to the Gulf and parts of south 
and south-east Asia, the majority will sustain the carrier's domestic growth ambitions.
"This is one of the most underpenetrated markets in the world," says Mr Ghosh. "There are 3m Indians for every 
plane we have in this country, compared to one in 50,000 people in developed markets   there is no overcapacity 
problem here."
India's passenger numbers soared nearly 20 per cent in 2011 to almost 60m compared with the previous year and 
analysts expect that figure to grow at about 15 per cent annually.
But Mr Ghosh says there is no space for complacency. With global markets in turmoil, plans for an initial public 
offering have been shelved as IndiGo focuses on sustaining profits in an environment in which Mr Ghosh expects at 
least one airline to go bankrupt within the next year.
"If market forces prevail then definitely there will be somebody really struggling that could go down," he says.
"I must add," he says quickly, "that this is not meant to be a self-serving statement. If tomorrow IndiGo is not 
running an efficient airline we do not deserve to be allowed either to survive."

Aer Lingus to issue first dividend since flotation

Aer Lingus, the Irish flag-carrier, will issue its first dividend since flotation six years ago and said it would aim to 
continue payouts to shareholders every year it makes an operating profit.
The change to dividend policy follows a strong first quarter, when growth in long-haul routes prompted an upgrade 
in full-year forecasts.
The planned payout of 3 cents a share - totalling EUR15.9m - follows pressure from the company's biggest 
shareholder, Ryanair, for access to the more than EUR400m net cash Aer Lingus holds on its balance sheet, 
though the low-cost carrier hit out on Friday at the "paltry" sum being offered.
The dividend, planned for July, will bolster Irish government coffers by about EUR4m, since Dublin owns 25 per 
cent of the airline. The government is seeking to sell that holding, but has been delayed by an ongoing debate over 
how to cover a EUR700m hole in the pension fund for Aer Lingus and Dublin airport employees. It has said it wants 
at least EUR1 per share, a threshold analysts believe should be easy to achieve.
Shares fell slightly in trading on Friday, to 98 cents.
Aer Lingus asked shareholders last autumn to approve technical changes that would allow special dividends to be 
paid. But it said on Friday that rather than special dividends, it was committed to annual payouts in years of 
operating profit, so long as the payments were "appropriate and prudent in the context of the group's financial 
position, strategic objectives and prospects". It said it would aim to repeat this 3 cent per share payout for another 
two years.
Aer Lingus to issue first dividend since flotation
Joe Gill, an analyst with Bloxham, said the conservative size of the dividend - against operating profits of EUR49m 
last year - could boost the value of the government's stake when it decides to sell.
He expects the holding to come on to the block this year, since "the troika" - the European Commission, 
International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank - overseeing Ireland's EUR68bn bailout recognise it 
will be easier to sell than other government assets.
Middle Eastern carrier Etihad has emerged as a strong contender to buy the holding after revealing a 3 per cent 
stake in the group this week and saying the two companies were in talks over forming a code-sharing agreement, 
which would allow them to sell seats on each other's flights.
Mr Gill said that sort of commercial deal would appeal to the government, which he expects will require any buyer to 
commit to retaining routes into Ireland and protecting the brand.

Airlines using London's Heathrow airport would pay higher landing fees to help sort out Britain's border chaos under 
a plan backed by David Cameron.
BAA, Heathrow's owner, is studying the proposal, which foresees airlines funding extra Border Force staff through 
the charges they pay the airport operator.
The plan emerged as the government was trying to contain a growing row over long queues at passport control at 
Heathrow. Ministers are hoping to fix the problem of two-hour plus queues by ensuring Border Force staff respond 
rapidly to big influxes of passengers inside Heathrow's immigration halls.
The prime minister believes airlines should meet a share of the cost of cutting the immigration queues. One 
government official said: "People standing in the lines often think it's the airlines' fault - not the government's."
Another official said: "The real answer is to get the airlines to pay for more security - that's the long-term answer."
BAA levies annual landing charges worth more than £1bn on airlines at Heathrow to pay for infrastructure 
investment, including some equipment at the border, such as e-passport gates, but the company is now interested 
in the possibility of also using the fees to pay for additional Border Force staff.
The Border Force's headcount is due to be cut by 18 per cent by 2015 compared to 2010 levels, and the reductions 
are contributing to the long queues at passport control at Heathrow.
Airline levy could aid UK border chaos
Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, British Airways parent, said on Tuesday morning that 
he had offered in the past to pay for more staff but Home Office officials had rejected the plan.
"We have a massive problem which is a government incapable or unwilling to address the issue," he told the BBC's 
Today programme.
He added that airlines would be prepared to pay for the right service but not if the government was wasting money.
Damian Green, the immigration minister, said that the plans had not yet been presented to the Home Office.
Mr Green tried to reassure travellers on Monday, telling parliament that queues at passport control at Heathrow 
were partly due to "severe weather".
&lt;
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
&gt; He promised all immigration desks at Heathrow and other airports would be staffed during peak periods for the 
Olympic Games.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said the lengthy immigration queues were not confined to Heathrow 
and highlighted similar issues at Stansted airport, from where the Irish budget airline operates. "The big problem 
with the queues at Heathrow and at Stansted is they [the Home Office] are treating EU citizens like potential bloody 
terrorists and they are not."
Mr O'Leary accused the UK Border Force of "mismanagement", claiming it was not short-staffed as a result of 
budget cuts but rather suffering from a work-to-rule mentality.
One person close to BAA said the idea of using landing charges to fund additional staff was at an early stage, with 
no final decisions having been reached. The person added the arrangements could involve airlines getting a rebate 
on their landing charges if the Border Force missed performance targets on queues at passport control.
Theresa May, Home Secretary, is expected to meet airlines this week and the landing charges proposal could be 
discussed.
A Home Office official said there was no opposition in principle to the idea of the private sector funding public sector 
border guards, just as shopping centres sometimes pay for local police to patrol malls. "We will look at the proposal 
with interest," said the official.
Complaints of chaos at British airports have been growing since late last year, following cuts in the number of 
Border Force staff and a Home Office decision to ban risk-based passport checks.
Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former media chief, said that when travelling back from Germany last week he had 
been shocked at the size of the queues at Heathrow's Terminal 5, which he said resembled the crowd emerging 
from a football stadium. "If you were a first time visitor coming in for the Olympics and you got stuck in something 
like that, you would think it wasn't right."
Boris Johnson, London's mayor, said the queues at passport control gave "a terrible impression of the UK".

The UK government has blamed the country's notorious weather for long immigration lines at airports last weekend 
that fanned fears about preparations for this summer's Olympics.
Damian Green, the immigration minister, told parliament on Monday that there had been "some breaches of 
acceptable waiting times" at London's Heathrow airport over the weekend, but blamed this on "severe weather" . 
While dismissing what he called "wild suggestions" about lengthy waiting times put forward by the opposition 
Labour party, Mr Green acknowledged that lines had been too long and promised that all immigration desks at 
Heathrow and other key border points would be staffed during peak periods for the 2012 Games.
Complaints of chaos at British airports have been growing since late last year, following cuts in the number of 
border officials and a Home Office decision to subject every arriving passenger to rigorous security checks. This 
was the result of a scandal last summer when some border officials were found to have relaxed border controls 
without permission.
London's outspoken mayor, Boris Johnson, said on Monday that the delays had given visitors "a terrible impression 
of the UK"  and urged ministers in his own Conservative party to take control of the situation.
"2 hr immigration line. 2 people at desks. Welcome to the UK. What a disgrace," one disgruntled visitor tweeted. 
Another added: "Great Britain should be called Great Obstacles."
Most airlines and BAA, Heathrow's operator, declined to comment on the controversy. But one person close to BAA 
questioned the government's suggestion that a stormy weekend was responsible for the airport tempest: "[The 
Heathrow chaos blamed on 'the weather'
government] would be better off focusing on providing enough staff for the [passport] checks they have put in 
place."
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said the lengthy immigration queues were not confined to Heathrow 
and highlighted similar issues at Stansted airport, where the Irish airline operates from.
"The big problem with the queues at Heathrow and at Stansted is they [the Home Office] are treating EU citizens 
like potential bloody terrorists and they are not," he said.
Mr O'Leary accused the Border Force of "mismanagement", claiming it was not short-staffed as a result of budget 
cuts but rather suffering partly from a work-to-rule mentality.

Airlines using London's Heathrow airport would pay higher landing fees to help sort out Britain's border chaos under 
a plan backed by David Cameron.
BAA, Heathrow's owner, is studying the proposal, which foresees airlines funding extra Border Force staff through 
the charges they pay the airport operator.
The plan emerged as the government was trying to contain a growing row over long queues at passport control at 
Heathrow. Ministers are hoping to fix the problem of two-hour plus queues by ensuring Border Force staff respond 
rapidly to big influxes of passengers inside Heathrow's immigration halls.
The prime minister believes airlines should meet a share of the cost of cutting the immigration queues. One 
government official said: "People standing in the lines often think it's the airlines' fault - not the government's."
Another official said: "The real answer is to get the airlines to pay for more security - that's the long-term answer."
BAA levies landing charges worth more than £1bn on airlines at Heathrow to pay for infrastructure investment, 
including some equipment at the border, such as e-passport gates, but the company is now interested in the 
possibility of using the fees to also pay for additional Border Force staff.
The Border Force's headcount is due to be cut by 18 per cent by 2015 compared to 2010 levels, and the reductions 
are contributing to the long queues at passport control at Heathrow.
Airline levy could aid UK border chaos
Damian Green, the immigration minister, tried to reassure travellers on Monday, telling parliament that queues at 
passport control at Heathrow were partly due to "severe weather".
He promised all immigration desks at Heathrow and other airports would be staffed during peak periods for the 
Olympic Games.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said the lengthy immigration queues were not confined to Heathrow 
and highlighted similar issues at Stansted airport, from where the Irish budget airline operates. "The big problem 
with the queues at Heathrow and at Stansted is they [the Home Office] are treating EU citizens like potential bloody 
terrorists and they are not."
Mr O'Leary accused the UK Border Force of "mismanagement", claiming it was not short-staffed as a result of 
budget cuts but rather suffering from a work-to-rule mentality.
One person close to BAA said the idea of using landing charges to fund additional staff was at an early stage, with 
no final decisions having been reached. The person added the arrangements could involve airlines getting a rebate 
on their landing charges if the Border Force missed performance targets on queues at passport control.
Theresa May, Home Secretary, is expected to meet airlines this week and the landing charges proposal could be 
discussed.
A Home Office official said there was no opposition in principle to the idea of the private sector funding public sector 
border guards, just as shopping centres sometimes pay for local police to patrol malls. "We will look at the proposal 
with interest," said the official.
Complaints of chaos at British airports have been growing since late last year, following cuts in the number of 
Border Force staff and a Home Office decision to ban risk-based passport checks.
Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former media chief, said that when travelling back from Germany last week he had 
been shocked at the size of the queues at Heathrow's Terminal 5, which he said resembled the crowd emerging 
from a football stadium. "If you were a first time visitor coming in for the Olympics and you got stuck in something 
like that, you would think it wasn't right," he said.
Boris Johnson, London's mayor, said the queues at passport control gave "a terrible impression of the UK".

From Mr Stephen McNamara.
Sir, BAA Stansted's recent claim that being "freed from regulation" and "better rail links" would allow it to double 
traffic is laughable. The Civil Aviation Authority's ineffective regulation only sets maximum price caps and the BAA 
has complete freedom to discount its high charges if it really wants to increase traffic, but instead BAA doubled 
prices and presided over record declines, which have seen Stansted traffic fall from 24m passengers in 2007 to 
fewer than 18m last year.
Might we suggest that, instead of advocating traffic growth strategies, which it clearly knows very little about, the 
BAA's time would be better spent complying with the Competition Commission's 2006 recommendation to sell 
Stansted, rather than wasting yet more time and money pursuing a seventh appeal against this sale order later this 
year. The BAA monopoly has failed at Stansted, and it's now time to let new owners work with airlines to deliver 
lower costs and rapid traffic growth.

Brussels opens its 18th Ryanair probe

Ryanair's tempestuous battle with Brussels moved to a new front on Wednesday as Europe's competition watchdog 
opened its 18th investigation into whether the carrier benefits from illegal state subsidies to airports.
The European Commission will probe Ryanair deals with Nîmes airport in France, which allegedly gave Europe's 
biggest low fares airline "undue economic advantage" over its competitors at the expense of French taxpayers.
This formal EU investigation is the latest in almost a score of inquiries into the terms offered by state-backed 
regional airports to attract Ryanair, including discounted landing and baggage handling charges. Ryanair dismissed 
the probe as "a goose chase".
Against the backdrop of the probes, the commission is planning to revise its state aid guidelines for the airline 
sector later this year. This will have potentially significant impact on Ryanair because the rules will more precisely 
address issues around the rise of low-cost carriers and the development of small regional airports.
Flag-carriers have little interest in smaller airports for anything other than their role feeding passengers to hubs 
offering higher-margin long-haul routes. But budget airlines have used them to drive the consumer-friendly point-to-
point market.
The Nîmes case is representative of many of the same issues raised in ongoing investigations into Ryanair airport 
deals such as Lübeck, Frankfurt Hahn, Zweibrücken, La Rochelle, Marseille, Stockholm-Västerås, Alghero and 
Aarhus. While Brussels' concerns originally focused on Ryanair's dealings with state-owned airports, it has moved 
on to probing facilities supported by smaller government bodies such as local authorities.
Brussels opens its 18th Ryanair probe
Officials are concerned that public subsidies and cash advances to Nîmes worth about EUR11m were used to 
"cover ordinary operating expenses", which distorted competition. Public subsidies to Veolia Transport, a private 
company which has operated the airport since 2007, will also be examined.
A key issue for the investigation is whether part of this potentially illegal state support was passed on to Ryanair, 
which was offered marketing support contracts and reduced charges to entice it to use the airport regularly.
Ryanair shrugged off the latest inquiry, saying that its "arrangements with all EU airports comply with competition 
rules". It added that European courts had "dismissed similar commission claims against Ryanair" over Charleroi 
airport in Belgium.
The commission recently reopened its investigation into Charleroi after its initial decision was struck down because 
the level of state support was assessed incorrectly. "The court never said that the public support granted to Ryanair 
was compatible with EU state aid rules," said the commission.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, regularly expresses contempt for Brussels, which blocked his proposed 
takeover of Aer Lingus in 2007. Competition officials reject claims of bias, pointing out that it has launched multiple 
probes into "traditional" airlines.

Issues up in the air after BMI takeover

When International Airlines Groupcompleted its deal to buy BMI from Lufthansa last week, both buyer and seller 
could rest assured that after a few months of regulatory limbo their main aims had been achieved.
IAG had secured for its subsidiary British Airways an important swath of take-off and landing slots at capacity-
constrained Heathrow airport. And Lufthansa could at last draw a line under an airline that had dented group 
earnings since 2009, when the German flag-carrier paid £223m for a controlling stake.
But completion is not quite closure, and a number of pressing questions remain unanswered for staff, customers, 
rivals and investors.
BMI employees were told this month that 1,200 jobs would be cut when the carrier was merged into BA, 
underscoring IAG's determination to run the lossmaking airline more efficiently.
But the extent to which the pain of these cuts can be mitigated by new positions and redundancy terms is unclear. 
There is also concern over the degree to which BMI workers' pension payouts will be dented after Lufthansa 
transfers the underfunded scheme to the UK pension insurer, leaving members exposed to losses.
On Friday staff also learnt their former German parent had not managed to sell two smaller, struggling units of BMI: 
its low-cost carrier, BMIbaby, and BMI Regional. Instead, both will be included in the IAG transaction and are now 
much more likely to be shut down, with their customers shunted off to competitors such as Ryanair and Flybe.
Issues up in the air after BMI takeover
For IAG and Lufthansa investors, the failure to offload BMIbaby and Regional means even the basic financial 
details of the deal are uncertain: the agreed price of £172.5m could be slashed by £80m-£100m, say analysts. 
Lufthansa promises precise numbers at the end of June and hopes to amortise costs within a year from that time.
The extent of BMI's troubles is evident in the fact that Lufthansa will probably lose hundreds of millions of euros on 
the deal, including EUR102m it is putting into topping up the pension fund.
But Lufthansa's management clearly believe the sacrifice is worthwhile given what the airline would have lost as a 
going concern. "The investors won't really mind because they are exiting a lossmaking business that was not going 
to be turned around," says Peter Hyde at Liberum Capital.
IAG, for its part, is not expected to turn round BMI's operations quickly - a near-impossible task at a full-service 
airline serving short and medium-haul customers, the market most affected by competition from low-cost carriers. 
Instead, the appeal of the purchase is BMI's Heathrow slots - at least 42 pairs after regulator-ordered disposals.
BA plans to use these to add new routes to emerging markets. But the process will not be immediate, not least 
because BA has promised to honour BMI bookings through the summer.
Moreover, Heathrow's slots are allocated on a "use them or lose them" basis, which means BA cannot simply slash 
all BMI's lossmaking routes, then fill the spare capacity at Heathrow at its own pace.
"The question is how quickly they can stop that cash burn," says Andrew Fitchie, an analyst with Investec. While it 
might be tempting to cut short-haul routes and add long-haul, he adds, "is now the right time in the cycle to put in 
another 747 flying London to New York?".
Mr Fitchie reckons the money BMI loses this year under BA might not be so different from the airline's EUR181m 
pre-tax loss under Lufthansa in 2011, even if BA is able to do away with discounting on some BMI routes such as 
Heathrow to Scottish airports where the two carriers used to compete.
Analysts at Credit Suisse also see room for better pricing and back-office savings in the near term. But they agree 
that, further out, the best chance for improving earnings comes from reallocating BMI's Heathrow slots. The airline 
does not even need to use all the slots itself: it could lease some to international partners, "significantly enhancing 
IAG's global strategic positioning", said the bank.
IAG itself expects the purchase to improve operating profits by EUR100m by 2015, and said it would give further 
details of its integration plans at first-quarter results next month.
In the meantime, rivals will be circling the spoils of the takeover, in the form of customers and Heathrow slots. 
Flybe, the UK regional airline, easyJet and Ryanair should benefit from reduced capacity once BMIbaby and 
Regional are shuttered.
And Virgin Atlantic, which remains indignant that the deal was ever approved, could increase its presence at 
Heathrow - perhaps even significantly if the old BMI slots are sold in one bundle.

Ryanair would be open to taking a stake in Stansted airport if prospective owners wanted the reassurance of a 
partnership with the airport's biggest customer, said Michael O'Leary, the low-cost carrier's chief executive, on 
Tuesday.
While London's third-biggest airport by passenger numbers is not yet up for sale, regulators have ordered owner 
BAA to dispose of it, assuming the company's final appeal against a 2009 Competition Commission ruling is 
rejected.
Stansted could attract significant interest, particularly if the government decides a new runway there is the solution 
to the south-east's air capacity woes. Stansted currently operates at half capacity, a situation Mr O'Leary blames on 
BAA doubling fees in recent years, thus driving away airline customers.
"We've talked to a number of interested bidders, and some are interested in Ryanair as a minority partner," said Mr 
O'Leary. "It's not something we want to do, but if a consortium wants us in as a shareholder we would consider it." 
Ryanair flights constitute three-quarters of Stansted's business.
Mr O'Leary also hit out at Stansted's recent plea to the government to invest in the airport's rail link to central 
London, with the goal of reducing journey times to 30 minutes from at least 45. "We have not received one letter 
from one customer complaining about the train," he said. "We don't need the UK government wasting money on 
spurious infrastructure."
Ryanair prepared to take stake in Stansted
Stansted's passenger numbers have fallen from 24m in 2007 to 18m last year, a decline it blames on wider 
economic decline and its high exposure to leisure travellers. But Mr O'Leary pointed out that low-cost carriers saw 
growth in that period.

Iberia is looking to slash pilots' pay by a fifth as it takes a hard line in its battle with their union over cost cuts and 
the launch of a budget carrier to compete with the likes of Ryanair and EasyJet.
Alongside the pay cut, which includes an across-the-board reduction in pay scales and changes to perks for pilots 
with 15 years' seniority, the airline is proposing to increase the number of hours pilots are expected to fly every year 
and eliminate extra holidays for senior staff.
Under recent reforms to Spanish labour law, companies are allowed to propose changes to contracts with 
employees if the groups have experienced two consecutive quarters of either losses or falling revenue - both of 
which apply to Iberia.
The proposals are an opening gambit that triggers 15 days of negotiation with the Sepla, the pilots union. That will 
be followed by another week of talks if an agreement cannot be reached, after which an arbitration committee will 
step in. Iberia expects a resolution in 50 days time.
Antagonism between management and Sepla is already intense, with the union starting a series of strikes last week 
to protest against the launch of Iberia Express, which offers worse pay and conditions than the mainline carrier.
Pilots are planning to strike every Monday and Friday for three and a half months, an action that could cost the 
airline up to EUR90m. International Airlines Group, the holding company of both Iberia and British Airways, says it 
will not back down given the damage high costs has done to profitability on Iberia's short- and medium-haul 
network.
Iberia looks to slash pilots' pay
Analysts on Tuesday agreed that the airline needed to take action. "Being an airline you have to continuously cut 
costs," said Gert Zonneveld at Panmure Gordon. "It's non-stop."
Iberia said the payroll cuts would reduce costs by EUR62m at an airline that produced an operating loss of 
EUR61m last year. It also expects the changed working arrangements to increase productivity by a quarter. José 
María Fariza, finance director, said the changes were "the sole means of ensuring success in the difficult situation 
faced by the airline".
He added that the moves would only affect pilots, since the unions representing cabin and ground crew have 
already reached deals with the airline for a new contract.
Douglas McNeill, an analyst at Charles Stanley, estimates Iberia's short-haul division lost EUR100m last year. 
"Saving this kind of money would still leave work to be done, but it would constitute very significant progress," he 
said on Tuesday.
He added that while these proposals might simply be an aggressive first move by the airline in a longer game, 
"Iberia pilots are already striking with such regularity that management doesn't have much to lose by upping the 
ante".

Monarch Airlines has appointed a new finance director in a management reshuffle that will also give chairman Iain 
Rawlinson permanent chief executive responsibilities.
The privately held charter carrier and scheduled operator is in the middle of a two-year turnround plan to return it to 
profit next year.
High fuel prices, a difficult consumer environment and competition from airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet 
contributed to an operating loss of £45m in the year to October 2011.
In November, the company's owners injected £75m to shore up finances and allow Monarch to launch 14 routes 
and to add narrow-body jets to a 28-aircraft fleet.
It also unveiled plans under which the group would aim to offer shorter flights to increase revenues per seat mile - a 
task that has been helped by its bigger rivals raising their own fares - and to reduce costs.
"We are starting to see the benefits of our work coming through in results," Mr Rawlinson said on Thursday.
He added that the group was "keen to maintain consistency and stability in the top team" but wanted the 
"experience, strength and clarity" of Robert Palmer as finance director.
Mr Palmer, a veteran of EasyJet, BMI and Air Malta, has been a consultant to Monarch for seven months and takes 
over from Simon Tucker, who is leaving.
Monarch aims for profit with reshuffle
The chief operating officer, Richard Mintern, is also leaving. His main responsibilities of overseeing the group's 
three divisions - the airline, package tours and aircraft engineering - will be handed to an expanded finance team.
Douglas McNeill, an airline analyst with Charles Stanley, said that "as a relatively small, leisure-focused airline 
facing high passenger taxes, high fuel costs and bigger, ever more efficient rivals, [Monarch is] probably finding life 
quite tough at present."
However, he said the group's shareholders, dominated by the Swiss-Italian Mantegazza family, appeared ready to 
fund it through difficult times.
A decade ago, Monarch shifted its focus from chartered flights to being a scheduled airline. Now Mr Rawlinson 
wants passengers to regard the brand as a step above its low-cost rivals but as a cheaper alternative to full-service 
carriers.
"I'm not sure there's a niche there," countered Mr McNeill. "The difference [between budget and full-service airlines] 
is obvious for business travellers, but it's a lot less distinct in the leisure market."
Other small European carriers are struggling to cope with high fuel prices. Two - Hungary's Malév and Catalonia-
based Spanair - have collapsed this year.

Iberia is asking a Spanish court to ban strikes by pilots who are protesting at the Spanish airline's push to stem its 
losses through the launch of a new low-cost carrier called Iberia Express.
On Monday, Iberia announced it was suing pilot and cabin crew unions in Spain's high court, asking for planned 
strikes to be declared illegal, and seeking damages for previous industrial action.
Last year Iberia merged with British Airways to form International Airlines Group, and Willie Walsh, chief executive, 
last month signalled his determination to proceed with cost-cutting at the Spanish airline through the launch of 
Iberia Express.
It is Mr Walsh's second face-off with unions over cost-cutting during IAG's brief history. Last year he successfully 
pushed through reductions in cabin crew on BA's long-haul routes, but only after a series of bruising strikes.
Sepla, the Spanish pilots' union, last week announced plans for 30 days of strikes starting on Easter Monday and 
lasting until July, in an escalating protest against Iberia Express.
The strikes by pilots began in December and cost Iberia an estimated EUR3m a day.
"Iberia has presented a lawsuit against the Sepla pilots union claiming the current ... strikes called by the union 
against the airline ... are illegal, and demanding damages," the carrier said on Monday.
It added that a similar lawsuit had been brought against Stavla, the union representing cabin crew, partly because 
of strikes in February.
Iberia urges court to ban pilots' strikes
Iberia said Spain's high court was expected to issue a ruling in about two months. It means at least some of Sepla's 
planned 30 days of strikes are likely to go ahead.
The carrier is running up losses amid the eurozone crisis and strong competition on short-haul routes from budget 
airlines led by Ryanair.
While IAG reported a pre-tax profit of EUR542m for 2011, its two subsidiaries recorded sharply contrasting 
performances. BA reported an operating profit of EUR592m for the year to December 31, partly because of strong 
transatlantic travel, but Iberia recorded a loss of EUR61m.

Passengers could face disruption at Stansted airport over the Easter weekend because of planned strike action by 
baggage handlers. The GMB union said 120 members who are employees of Swissport, the baggage handling 
company, were preparing to take four hours of strike action on Good Friday, April 7 and April 9, because of a 
dispute over changes to shift patterns.
Swissport is one of two baggage handlers at Stansted for passenger flights, and the company provides services to 
eight airlines and charter operators at the airport including Ryanair, Thomas Cook and Monarch. The GMB said 
members had voted overwhelmingly for strike action over Swissport's proposed changes to shift patterns, adding: 
"Unless there are urgent talks and a settlement, this vote for action will result in disruption over the Easter bank 
holiday weekend."
Swissport said it was planning shift changes at Stansted because the company is servicing fewer flights, but 
rejected the GMB's claims that employees would see their pay cut. BAA, Stansted's owner, said: "Swissport are 
confident that even if strike action does take place, contingency plans are in place and flights will operate as 
normal."

Iberia is facing 30 days of strikes by its pilots in an escalating protest against the Spanish airline's new low-cost 
carrier, Iberia Express, which launched this week.
Sepla, the Spanish pilots union, said on Tuesday that it was organising strikes every Monday and Friday between 
April 9 and July 20 after negotiations with Iberia about Iberia Express broke down last week.
Iberia Express is a central part of efforts by International Airlines Group, Iberia's parent, to return the Spanish airline 
to profit. Iberia is running up losses amid the eurozone crisis and strong competition on short-haul routes from 
budget airlines led by Ryanair.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, last month signalled the group would not back down over plans for Iberia 
Express because of the strikes, which began in December and are costing about EUR3m during each day of 
industrial action, because the new low-cost carrier is an important means of reducing Iberia's operating costs on 
short- and medium-haul routes.
Iberia said on Tuesday that it "regrets the irresponsible and uncompromising attitude of Sepla pilots union", adding 
it would "do its best to minimise the impact of this strike on customers".
Sepla, which represents Iberia's 1,600 pilots, claims the creation of Iberia Express contravenes agreements made 
during Iberia's merger with British Airways last year, and called 12 days of strikes over Christmas in response.
A period of talks between the union and Iberia using a government-approved mediator broke down on Sunday, the 
same day as the first flight by Iberia Express.
Iberia pilots plan 30 days of strikes
While IAG reported a pre-tax profit of EUR542m for 2011, its two subsidiaries had starkly different performances. 
British Airways reported an operating profit of EUR592m for the year to December 31, on the back of strong 
demand for transatlantic air travel, but Iberia recorded a loss of EUR61m.
Mr Walsh has reduced operating costs at BA by cutting staff on its long-haul network, but the move prompted a 
bitter strike by cabin crew in 2010 and the industrial action only ended in June last year.
At IAG's full-year results last month, Mr Walsh accused Sepla of refusing to face up to reality.
"There is no way Iberia can continue to operate as it has operated in the past," he said. "And anybody in Iberia who 
believes that that option is open to them is, quite honestly, deluded."
Rafael Sánchez-Lozano, Iberia's chief executive, went further, saying the previous strike action organised by Sepla 
had been a "disgrace".
"As I tell the pilots, this is like a hunger strike," he added. "If you are very successful, you die."

Seats in the exit rows of some EasyJet flights will cost £12 from April as the no-frills airline seeks to attract 
customers reluctant to take part in the boarding-time mélee of budget flying.
Under EasyJet's first experiment with allocated seating - on routes between Luton and six destinations including 
Malaga, Istanbul and Glasgow - passengers will be assigned a spot, with an algorithm used to sit people booking 
together next to one another.
Passengers willing to pay £3 can choose their seats, although exit row and front row seats - with extra legroom - will 
cost an additional £9, and those towards the front an extra £5.
EasyJet is hopeful the feature will attract business travellers who tend to book later, buy flexible fares and worry 
less about price.
Risks include longer aircraft turnround times that keep down costs,  and a fall in passengers paying for speedy 
boarding, a product some people use for early access to preferred seats. Speedy boarding, at £9-£16 a flight, 
raised tens of millions of pounds for the airline last year.
EasyJet's bigger rival, Ryanair, already lets passengers reserve some seats for a charge, but operates open 
seating on the rest of the aircraft.
Carolyn McCall, EasyJet chief executive, said the trial, which will run through the summer, has cost the group about 
£5m, most of which stems from IT upgrades, and would be "revenue-neutral at worst". But she emphasised that this 
summer's focus was on "the passenger journey and the operations".
EasyJet offers exit-row seats for £12
Details of the trial came as the company said it would beat its own expectations for the first half of its financial year, 
shortening losses by £30m-£40m, after a mild winter.
In recent years Europe's airlines have been hurt by severe weather, industrial action by air traffic controllers, and 
the eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland.
EasyJet said it expected to report a pre-tax loss of £110m-£120m for the six months to March 31, against previous 
guidance of a loss of £140m-£160m. The shares rose 7 per cent, or 32.6p, to 494p.
Analysts at Goodbody Capital Markets said the first-half upgrades "may ease some of the fears around the impact 
of the recent rise in the oil price on the [low-cost carriers] and add to comfort on the revenue dynamics, though half 
of the revenue improvement at EasyJet is company-specific.
"The improved forecast came in spite of the airline being hit by a £100m increase in its first-half fuel bill, which it 
said would widen to £145m in the second half, including currency fluctuations. While fuel prices continued to climb 
in the six months to the end of March, costs per seat excluding fuel have risen only 1.5 per cent from the same 
period last year, compared with the 3 per cent expected increase.
"In a difficult environment for all airlines, improvements in revenue management combined with marketing and 
website initiatives have enabled EasyJet to take advantage as weaker competitors have left the market over the 
past couple of months," it said.
Many airlines are traditionally loss-making in the first half, as winter routes are pared back and aircraft are less full. 
In 2011 EasyJet reported an interim pre-tax loss of £153m from revenues of £1.3bn, but swung to a pre-tax profit of 
£248m for the full year to September 30.
EasyJet said its costs per seat for the full year would rise 2 per cent from last year's £51.30, "assuming no 
significant disruption arising from events such as airspace congestion during the Olympics".
That caveat echoes a letter sent by EasyJet and other UK airlines this month to the Civil Aviation Authority. They 
said the aviation system was not prepared for freak events, such as a bad thunderstorm during the London 
Olympics this summer, and called on the CAA to give the UK's air traffic controllers greater flexibility during what is 
expected to be a busy period.

Ryanair's fight against laws obliging it to feed and lodge airline customers stranded by events such as the 2010 
volcanic ash cloud has been dealt a blow by the European Court of Justice.
Yves Bot, the court's advocate-general, published an opinion on Wednesday stating that airlines were not exempt 
from regulations requiring them to pay for stranded passengers' hotels, meals and drinks even if flight cancellations 
were caused by circumstances beyond their control.
As such, Mr Bot said Ryanair should have paid the room and board for Denise McDonagh, whose flight from Faro 
to Dublin two years ago was cancelled in the wake of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano's eruptions, stranding her in 
Portugal for a week.
The ECJ has yet to issue a ruling in the case but often decides along the lines of opinions from the advocate-
general. The ruling will have little impact on Ryanair's finances, given that all other cases related to the volcanic-ash 
disruption have been settled. But it could weaken airlines' future arguments for exemption from their obligations.
However, Siim Kallas, Europe's transport commissioner, has launched a review of passenger-rights laws passed in 
2005, and is expected to propose new legislation later this year that would limit airlines' responsibility to care for 
stranded passengers.
Commission officials said they still stood behind the bloc's passenger-rights laws, but have also accepted the airline 
industry's argument that carriers should not be required to assume those responsibilities for extended stretches due 
to events beyond their control.
Ryanair set back in volcanic ash case
Mr Bot disagreed, arguing in his opinion on Wednesday that "the provision of care is particularly important in the 
case of extraordinary circumstances which persist over a long time", and pointing out that airlines can pass on the 
cost of these obligations to customers, through higher fares.
A key point of debate as the regulations are honed will be determining at what point the airlines' responsibility 
should end and national governments should be called on to shoulder the burden, as they do with floods and other 
natural disasters.
Ryanair argued in the McDonagh case that it should only be responsible for three nights' accommodation, with a 
price cap of EUR80 a night, and that similar limits on food and drink should be imposed.
The low-cost airline on Wednesday emphasised the non-binding nature of Mr Bot's opinion. "We hope the final 
Court decision will find in favour of Ryanair's appeal and remove the blatant discrimination in the EU261 airline 
regulations," it said, referring to different standards for companies running different types of passenger transport, 
such as ferry and coach.
The European Consumer Organisation welcomed the opinion. "EU law in this area is a clear example of rights 
which are robust on paper, but devalued by a lack of enforcement," it said.

You are not a real country unless you have a beer and an airline, Frank Zappa once observed. In 1993, the year of 
his death, there was much truth to the rock musician's aphorism. Twenty years later, there isn't - at least as regard 
Europe and its airlines.
One by one, Europe's medium-sized and small nations are discovering that independence can survive the 
disappearance of an independent national airline. Several former flag carriers, such as Austrian Airlines, Brussels 
Airlines and Swiss, are under full or partial foreign control. Others, such as the Czech Republic's CSA, Lot of 
Poland and Portugal's TAP, are going along the same flight path. Two have gone bust this year: Hungary's Malev  
and, to stretch the definition of a national airline, Spanair of Catalonia. The rest are turning into zombies, which 
stronger rivals cannot be bothered either to absorb or to kill off.
Europe still has too many airlines, but the contours of a consolidated sector are emerging. It is reasonable to expect 
that the five dominant operators of the future will be Germany's Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, International Airlines 
Group (consisting of the old British Airways and Spain's Iberia), Ryanair and EasyJet.
The latter two low-fare airlines are famously nimble, cost-conscious and quick-thinking. No sooner did Malev bite 
the dust last month than Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, announced that his aircraft would replace most 
of the traffic and routes lost at Budapest airport. EasyJet knows its onions too: its 12.7 per cent return on capital 
employed last year was an impressive achievement.
What of Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG? Thanks to their state-controlled legacy, these are often considered 
lumbering beasts, scarred by recurring outbreaks of labour unrest. How well placed are they to deliver profits and 
compete with the fast-growing airlines of the Gulf, China and south-east Asia?
Europe's airline brew must lose some froth
In the short term there is no question that conditions will be difficult. According to the International Air Transport 
Association, which represents the world's airlines, the industry as a whole will eke out a $3.5bn profit this year but 
European carriers will lose $600m. Rising fuel prices and Europe's bleak macroeconomic outlook will bite into their 
profits.
That said, Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG are striving to adapt to the harsh climate. Arguably, their most 
frustrating problem is Europe's clumsy strategic approach to the development of air transport. Take Lufthansa's 
cargo business. This division is one of the company's most precious assets. It chalked up EUR249m in operating 
profit last year, the unit's second-best annual result. Without the contribution of Lufthansa Cargo, the group's net 
loss would have exceeded EUR13m and - who knows? - shareholders might not have received a dividend.
Almost certainly, Lufthansa Cargo will this year record a lower profit. One reason is that a German court imposed a 
ban last October on night flights over Lufthansa's Frankfurt hub. Whether or not this ruling satisfied people who live 
near the airport, it seemed a peculiar decision: Frankfurt airport had just opened a fourth runway, partly with a view 
to helping Lufthansa. If a higher court backs the ruling next month, Lufthansa Cargo estimates it will lose EUR40m 
in annual earnings.
Similar policymaking confusion hinders the expansion of airport capacity in other parts of Europe. One glaring 
example is the UK, whose coalition government has ruled out a third runway at London Heathrow - Europe's 
busiest hub - but seems in two minds about whether to follow the alternative route of building an  airport in the 
Thames estuary.
This indecision exasperates Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive. A EUR485m operating profit last year demonstrated 
his ability to maximise returns from the North Atlantic routes that are his group's main strength. A takeover of TAP, 
which Portugal's debt-stricken government is putting up for sale, would add useful South Atlantic routes. The 
proposed acquisition of BMI  would strengthen its UK position. But bolt-on acquisitions such as these are less 
important than the modern London hub that IAG needs to flourish in the long term.
Most embarrassing of all is the failure of Europe's governments to make meaningful progress on creating a so-
called "single European sky" for air traffic management. At present no fewer than 38 national air navigation services 
manage Europe's airspace. Airlines justifiably regard the cost of such inefficiency as unacceptable.
The European Union deserves praise for having liberalised the aviation market in the 1990s. But the ensuing 54 per 
cent increase in air traffic makes it inexcusable that governments lack the political will to unify Europe's airspace or 
to build more capacity in its airports. If Europe wants an airline industry that thrives as well as consolidates, this is 
the place to start.

THE PROBLEM
Last week Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, challenged UK ministers to have the 
"political balls" to review its opposition to building a third runway at London's Heathrow airport. Is it a good strategy 
to use such colourful language in public when trying to persuade policymakers? Or is it more pragmatic to adopt a 
more diplomatic tone?
THE ADVICE
The media adviser: Tim Allan
Willie Walsh is doing exactly the right thing: putting the case on a critical issue for his business in clear, eye-
catching terms.
Maybe it is something about the noise of aircraft, but the airline industry attracts chief executives who are not afraid 
of shouting their case from the rooftops.
What Mr Walsh and Ryanair's Michael O'Leary do is recognise that communication with politicians cannot only be 
about submissions to consultation papers. Companies often need to back up their direct lobbying with a clear 
public-facing campaign. In short, they have to have the communication balls to make their case loud and clear in 
public and private.
The writer is the founder of Portland and a former media adviser to Tony Blair
..................................................
Should you use colourful language to lobby?
The academic: Paul Argenti
Those of us who teach and write about communication would advise anyone considering using profanity when 
trying to persuade a key constituency to act in your best interest: don't ever do it. It immediately turns people off the 
message, and switches their focus on to anger instead.
Your goal when communicating in business is to get your audience to do what you want. So, if Willie Walsh really 
wanted politicians to build a third runway at Heathrow, he should have looked at it from their perspective. All he did 
was get his rocks off - to use another colourful phrase - and while it might have felt good for a few moments, the 
outcome is not so good.
The writer is a professor of corporate communications at the Tuck School of Business
..................................................
The industry rep: Bryan Green
In public debate, colourful language can deliver results only if people feel it is authentic to the speaker. Think Bob 
Geldof circa 1985 and Live Aid. A few choice words, screamed at the right people underscored a passionate belief 
and a call to action.
But there are few Geldofs.
When expletives explode in the course of cajoling organisations and policymakers, too often it signals the speaker's 
position is weakening. That invites those with opposing views to exploit that weakness and sidelines potential allies 
who focus on the behaviour rather than the argument.
Much more impactful are the firm but considered types. Lobbying requires quiet calculation; considered counsel and 
persistence. In short, think less Geldof and more Gandhi.

Olympic planners should not count on a mass of Londoners escaping the capital during the games this summer, a 
survey has revealed.
An analysis of flight bookings made through late February shows that while bookings for journeys into London 
during the games period have surged by a quarter from last year, outbound travel from the capital's five airports - 
Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton and City - is set to fall 11 per cent.
"The assumption was that there would be people fleeing the Olympics, but they want to stick around and see it," 
said Holger Taubman at Amadeus, an IT providers to airlines, which commissioned the survey - one of the first to 
quantify residents' travel plans during the 16-day event.
The numbers - compiled from the four biggest airline reservation systems - will be of interest to groups responsible 
for the robustness of public transport during the games, with organisers counting on many commuters staying off 
London's network to make way for visitors.
The hope is that many Londoners will either work from home or go on holiday. But the latter option seems more 
likely to happen in the week after the games, according to Amadeus, which found bookings for travel after August 
12 - the closing ceremony - had increased by 6 per cent from last year.
While fewer than one in eight journeys travelled in late July and early August last year were booked by late 
February, Mr Taubman believes the trends recorded so far will continue through spring and early summer, with the 
possible exception of business travel.
Londoners opt to stay put for Olympics
"Business travellers will say they want to keep that time clear, so [booking] holds off but ticks up closer to the date. 
That's also what we see with [football] world championships," he said. "Overall during the year it levels off."
His colleagues in the airline industry have mixed views of the effect the Olympics will have on their business, with 
IAG, the holding group of British Airways and Iberia, arguing it will have a negative impact. "Past experience in 
other host cities suggests that demand could be dampened during the games," said Willie Walsh, chief executive, 
on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Ryanair, which launched 26 new routes out of London earlier this week, said none were spurred by 
Olympic-related travel forecasts.
Amadeus found that of the surging inbound bookings, Americans and Germans are leading the way, with people 
from countries that often do well in summer Olympic Games - such as Brazil, Japan and Jamaica - also showing 
significant rises.
Nor is London the only destination benefiting from the games. Brussels and Amsterdam have also experienced an 
increase in inbound bookings, in line with that for the UK capital, as travellers apparently decide to use Eurostar for 
the final leg of their journeys.

Aer Lingus has warned its business model would be put at risk if the Irish government sold its 25 per cent stake to a 
rival airline whose interests conflicted with those of its partners such as British Airways, Air France-KLM and United 
Airlines.
"One of the reasons we've been successful this year is that we have a broad range of partners in the industry," 
Andrew McFarlane, chief financial officer, said on Tuesday. "If a stake was sold in a way that was deeply offensive 
to any of our partners, that would damage our business."
His comments came a week after Dublin struck a deal with its main lenders - the European Union, European 
Central Bank and International Monetary Fund - to sell up to EUR3bn of state assets over the next two years, 
including its holding in Aer Lingus.
The flag-carrier attributes rising revenues - up 6 per cent in 2011, it said in its full-year results statement - in part to 
code-sharing agreements with individual airlines, an approach it developed since dropping out of the Oneworld 
airline alliance in 2007.
Etihad, the expanding Middle Eastern carrier, was said to be in talks with Dublin last year about buying the 
government's stake in Aer Lingus. Mr McFarlane declined to comment on whether such a move would cause 
problems for the company: "That would be for the partners to take a view on," he said.
International Airlines Group, the holding company for BA, is also considered a candidate to buy the stake.
Aer Lingus warns Dublin over stake sale
The airline will reconsider this year the case for rejoining an alliance. Meanwhile, an ongoing cost-cutting 
programme, yield management and a small increase in passenger numbers last year went some way toward 
counteracting rising fuel costs and airport charges that were 8 and 9 per cent higher, respectively. Still, underlying 
operating profits fell to EUR49.1m, from EUR52.5m.
Pre-tax profit nearly tripled to EUR42.2m, following a fine in 2010 over a leave-and-return scheme for employees 
and a one-off EUR26m pension payment. Earnings per share rose from 8.1 cents to 13.4 cents. Mr McFarlane said 
economic forecasts were still too uncertain for the company to pay a dividend.
A EUR700m hole in the pension scheme for staff and former employees of Aer Lingus and Dublin Airport could 
complicate any sale of the government's stake, with the share price depressed by fears the airline will have to put 
some of its EUR895m gross cash towards making up the shortfall. Dublin has said in the past it would not want to 
sell at less than EUR1 a share.
Mr McFarlane reiterated the group's position that it is not responsible for filling the pension hole. Its other big 
shareholder, Ryanair, has been lobbying for assurances Aer Lingus will not compromise on this position.
Ryanair has also said it would be willing to part with its 29.8 per cent stake, which it built up ahead of two bids for its 
rival, both of which were stymied by Irish and European regulators. Dublin has rejected any notion of selling its 
holding to Ryanair.
Aer Lingus shares fell slightly in early Dublin trading to EUR0.94.

shareholder, Ryanair, has been lobbying for assurances Aer Lingus will not compromise on this position.
Ryanair has also said it would be willing to part with its 29.8 per cent stake, which it built up ahead of two bids for its 
rival, both of which were stymied by Irish and European regulators. Dublin has rejected any notion of selling its 
holding to Ryanair.
Aer Lingus shares fell slightly in early Dublin trading to EUR0.94.

Ryanair said it would cut five routes from its summer schedule at Edinburgh Airport just as shortlisted bidders in the 
contest to acquire one of the UK's fastest growing airports begin due diligence.
The Irish carrier blamed its decision, which should reduce passenger numbers by 300,000 this year, on the airport 
owner's refusal to reduce take-off and landing fees. "While Ryanair remains committed to Edinburgh Airport ... BAA 
Edinburgh cannot continue to ignore the competitive marketplace," said Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive.
BAA played down the capacity cuts, pointing out that three of the routes on the chopping block - from Edinburgh to 
Malmo, Murcia and Ibiza - were  launched only last month, and questioned Mr O'Leary's assertion that the changes 
would endanger 300 jobs at the airport.
"BAA employs 500 people at the airport in total, so the job losses they're talking about do seem excessive," the 
company said.
But the spat underscores the challenges for future owners of the airport, which BAA is selling under orders from the 
UK Competition Commission. Shortlisted bidders are understood to include Global Infrastructure Partners; 
JPMorgan Asset Management; and consortiums led by the private equity groups 3i and Carlyle.

High fuel prices have dragged Norwegian Air Shuttle to a bigger than expected loss for the fourth quarter, 
prompting the low-cost carrier to reassure that it was still on track with its plan to dominate the Nordic airline market.
The third-largest budget carrier in Europe by passenger numbers, which last month announced plans to triple its 
fleet over the next eight years in a bid to usurp SAS as the biggest carrier in Scandinavia, reported that fourth-
quarter losses had widened from Nkr27.2m ($4.7m) to NKr187.7m.
Bjorn Kjos, chief executive, said that the fall in profits - which was partly due to a 32 per cent rise in average fuel 
prices - was nothing to be alarmed about and only highlighted how important it was to continue with plans to buy a 
fleet of more fuel efficient aircraft.
"It is essential to have new aircraft to offset the increase in fuel prices," he said, adding that airlines with old fleets 
risked bankruptcy in the coming years as fuel costs are likely to remain high and demand sluggish in much of 
Europe.
Spanair, Spain's fifth-largest carrier by passengers, filed for bankruptcy protection late last month after struggling to 
compete with low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, as well as Vueling, Iberia's medium-haul subsidiary.
For the final quarter of 2011 Norwegian reported an 18 per cent year-on-year rise in revenues to NKr2.5bn as 
passenger numbers rose 20 per cent to 4m. But higher fuel prices meant that the loss per share widened from 
NKr0.6 to Nkr3.78.

Analysts said that while the results were worse than expected, there was little in them that should make the 
company question its rapid expansion policy. Full-year profits fell 31 per cent to NKr167m as revenues rose 22 per 
cent to NKr10.5bn.
"I think Norwegian will have the upper hand in the Nordic region as they have a lower unit cost than their rivals," 
said Jacob Petersen, analyst at Sydbank. "It will be very exciting to see how competition with SAS evolves."
The company announced in January that it was planning to buy 222 new aircraft worth $22bn from Boeing and 
Airbus, in a move that would increase the number of aircraft available to the carrier from 62 to as many as 200.
The 220 new orders would put Norwegian in the same league as Ryanair and EasyJet, which operate 275 and 196 
aircraft respectively. Norwegian has no plans to compete with them on central European routes, however.
"We will have the dominance of the northern sector of Europe," said Mr Kjos, in an interview with the Financial 
Times earlier in the month, adding that "we will not have any problems competing with Ryanair" if it decided to 
expand aggressively into the Nordic region.

China's upstart aims to put rivals in a spin

An upstart Chinese rival is about to make life for Airbus and Boeing a lot more difficult, at least according to Michael 
O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair.
In assisting the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, or Comac, on the development of a new commercial jet, Mr 
O'Leary has seen first-hand the vast investment that Beijing is making to break into the ranks of the world's elite 
aircraft manufacturers.
"The Chinese will take a huge amount of orders away from Airbus and Boeing overnight, which will create 
significant turmoil in the marketplace," he predicted last year.
Others in the industry are far more sceptical. They say that Comac's biggest advantage - its strong state backing - 
may also be its biggest obstacle.
Comac's first foray into manufacturing has certainly met stiff headwinds. The ARJ21, a regional jet meant to 
compete with those from Embraer and Bombardier, completed its maiden flight in 2008, three years behind 
schedule. There have also been repeated delays in its airworthiness certification.
When it does eventually enter commercial service, perhaps this year, it is likely to be about as technically 
advanced, but not as efficient, as Embraers that are a decade older, says Bradley Perrett, a Chinese aerospace 
expert with Aviation Week in Beijing.
While that would be a disastrous debut for a privately owned company, state-owned Comac has been able to chalk 
it up to experience.
China's upstart aims to put rivals in a spin
Its second aircraft programme, the narrow-body C919, appears to going more smoothly, though it is still at an early 
stage of development. This is the aircraft that has so caught Ryanair's attention, offering a potential alternative to 
the top-selling Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.
The C919 was a well-selected project, aiming at a gap that had opened in the market because Boeing and Airbus 
had done little to modernise their models. Comac has turned to foreign companies such as General Electric and 
Honeywell for components that should make its aircraft more technologically advanced.
"The problem is they have got to pull it all together and make it work." Mr Perrett says. "It is not likely that Comac 
can integrate this technology and create highly competitive aircraft that can be sold without heavy production 
subsidies, at least at first."
Comac says it has already received 215 orders for the C919, mainly from state-owned airlines and leasing 
companies. The final product may be more marketable than the ARJ21, but the C919 programme is also expected 
to be a money loser, another learning experience for Comac.
Despite these difficulties, the government's resolve to build a global aerospace champion is showing no sign of 
waning. Last year Beijing made aircraft manufacturing a cornerstone of its "new strategic industry" plan, locking in 
long-term financial support for Comac.
Further more, in an indication that national leaders are satisfied with the company's progress, its former chairman 
Zhang Qingwei was promoted to an important political post as governor of Hebei province last year.
The prize for Comac is less the global market than it is China itself. Boeing estimates that China will add 5,000 
commercial aircraft worth $600bn by 2030, making it far and away the biggest purchaser of aircraft over the coming 
decade.
Comac has targeted a one-third share of the domestic market, which is currently split roughly evenly between 
Airbus and Boeing.
"The way this market works, [Comac] will eat into everyone's share," says Ihssane Mounir, a senior vice-president 
with Boeing. "But we are not worried about competition. Competition is the mother of all improvements."
If Comac can successfully produce efficient aircraft, it will ignite a big debate about the appropriate relationship 
between government and aircraft manufacturers - Airbus and Boeing have been at the centre of a long-running 
World Trade Organisation case over subsidies.
However, some observers believe that state control will ultimately also check Comac's progress. "We've seen this 
before," says Richard Aboulafia, vice-president of Teal Group, an aerospace consultancy. "This was the Soviet 
Union's approach. It produces an incredibly expensive duplication of an aircraft industry supply chain, all of which is 
always playing catch-up."
Comac is mainly drawing on components made by foreign companies with joint ventures in China, as the 
government has mandated. Yet these companies are not offering their latest or best technology to China because 
of insufficient protection of intellectual property.
Mr Aboulafia says production process effectively guarantees mediocrity and that the only solution was to give 
engineers freedom to choose whatever components they want, insulated from political interference.
"China could one day be a world aviation powerhouse, but they will have to head in a totally different direction. 
State-owned enterprises do have a place in this world. Commercial jetliner production is most definitely not one of 
them," he says.

SAS, the struggling Scandinavian airline group, on Wednesday warned of a weak start to 2012 after reporting its 
fourth consecutive full-year net loss.
SAS announced plans to accelerate a cost-cutting programme, involving 300 job losses, after recording a net loss 
of SKr1.7bn ($255m) for 2011.
The airline is reeling from increased competition from low-cost carriers led by Ryanair and Norwegian Air Shuttle, 
as well as high fuel prices. SAS declined to provide earnings guidance for 2012 partly because of the deteriorating 
economic environment. The airline's shares closed down 10 per cent at SKr8.70.
Rickard Gustafson, chief executive, said: "The challenging nature of the prevailing economic climate in combination 
with the earnings effect of [the cost-saving programme] being realised in the latter part of 2012 mean that the 
seasonally weak first quarter will also remain weak in 2012."
He added that yields - a measure of the average fare paid by passengers - would continue to come under pressure 
in 2012 after falling by 2 per cent at the main SAS airline in 2011 compared with the previous year. The group's 
load factor - the number of seats occupied on flights - also deteriorated in 2011.
Norwegian Air Shuttle last month announced plans to buy 222 aircraft, and some analysts said its planned fleet 
expansion - from 64 to as many as 200 by 2020 - looked like a bet on the failure of SAS.
SAS issued a profit warning last month, saying it no longer expected to record a pre-tax profit for 2011 because of 
the collapse of Spanair, the Spanish airline.
SAS plans cost cuts amid more losses
SAS had an 11 per cent stake in Spanair, and the Scandinavian carrier's fourth-quarter results included a SKr1.7bn 
impairment charge relating to the collapse.
It meant SAS reported a net loss of SKr2.1bn for the three months to December 31, compared with a profit of 
SKr47m in the fourth quarter of 2010. Revenue fell by 4.6 per cent in the fourth quarter to SKr10.2bn.
For the full year, SAS generated SKr41.4bn of revenue, up 0.8 per cent compared with 2010. The net loss 
narrowed from SKr2.2bn in 2010 to SKr1.7bn in 2011, partly because of cost-cutting. The loss per share was 
SKr5.13 in 2011, compared with SKr7.79 in 2010.
The airline's gross cash position deteriorated from SKr5bn at the end of 2010 to SKr3.8bn at December 31. Net 
debt rose from SKr2.9bn to SKr7bn.
SAS is planning to secure cost savings worth SKr3.5bn over the next two years, including cutting 300 administrative 
jobs.

The trick to dog fighting in a Starfighter supersonic jet was to fly high above the clouds and then dive down on your 
enemy at speed, according to Bjorn Kjos, the chief executive and co-founder of Norwegian Air Shuttle.
Mr Kjos retired from the Norwegian air force in the mid-1970s but, from his sleek Oslo office, he is still doing 
business using the tactics he learnt there. The key difference now is that he has rival airlines, rather than enemy 
fighter aircraft, in his crosshairs.
Last month Mr Kjos pulled the trigger on the biggest aircraft order in European aviation history, announcing plans to 
buy 222 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus worth $22bn at list price.
The move will triple the number of aircraft available to the midsized low-cost carrier over the next eight years from 
62 to as many as 200, presenting a direct challenge to SAS, the dominant airline in Scandinavia, which has 
struggled to turn a full-year profit since 2007.
"We will have the dominance of the northern sector of Europe," says Mr Kjos, leaving no doubt who he thinks would 
come out on top should, as analysts argue, the Scandinavian market not be able to sustain both SAS and the 
expanded Norwegian Air.
Mr Kjos, who is a former paratrooper, lawyer, judge, pilot and author of a spy thriller, said that the new Boeing 737s, 
737-800s and Airbus 320s will make Norwegian 11-15 per cent more fuel efficient, allowing the company to fly for 
less than half of what it costs rival SAS.
Low-cost Norwegian airline ready for dogfight
He adds that the aviation industry is entering a new era where it will be "absolutely impossible" to compete while 
flying old aircraft because of the high cost of fuel. There will be "a change in the players" in European aviation and 
more bankruptcies, he predicts.
SAS is not the only rival Norwegian will encounter as it rolls out its ambitious expansion plans. Ryanair, the leading 
low cost carrier in Europe, has highlighted Scandinavia as a key growth target in the coming years and has even 
threatened to run some domestic flights.
But Mr Kjos is confident that Norwegian can defeat Ryanair as well. "We will not have any problems competing with 
Ryanair," in the Nordic region, he says. "Scandinavians are conservative and want to stick with the airlines they 
know."
Ryanair will also struggle to secure the "crucial business customer" because it flies from secondary airports and 
offers a worse experience in some respects, he says. "We have better leg room, reclining seats, and WiFi on all the 
new aeroplanes."
The 220 new orders will put Norwegian in the same league as Ryanair and EasyJet, which operate 275 and 196 
aircraft respectively. Norwegian has no plans to compete with them on central European routes, however.
Analysts are concerned about the size of the $22bn order for a medium-sized business which made pre-tax profits 
of just NKr243m ($41m) on revenues of NKr8.6bn in 2010. Norwegian already has net debt of Nkr2.5bn after 
placing big orders in 2007, which is only slightly short of its Nkr2.7bn market capitalisation.
The company says that 85 per cent of the money for each new aircraft will be backed by the Export-Import Bank of 
the US and by European export credit agencies, lowering its interest rates considerably. The other 15 per cent will 
have to be provided by the company from existing operations and selling old aircraft.
Norwegian will keep the new aircraft for six to eight years, says Mr Kjos, and sell them on, hoping that the initial 
discount they received on the order means that they will not lose too much money on the resale.
Another source for concern is Norwegian's proposed long-haul operation expansion plan, which will focus on the 
growing market in China. "Norwegian already has a bit of a stretched balance sheet and this move into long haul 
means more capital expenditure" says Lars-Tore Turtveit, analyst at SEB Enskilda.
But Mr Kjos, who owns 27 per cent of Norwegian Air, says that costs will be driven down by flying direct to major 
hubs including Bangkok and New York and by using existing infrastructure and foreign crews as much as possible.
The story of Norwegian Air Shuttle started in 1993 when Mr Kjos and some pilot friends took over the remains of 
bankrupt local carrier Busy Bee. Throughout the 1990s it ran flights in Norway on contract from Braathens, which 
was then the county's dominant carrier.
But in 2001 Braathens was bought by SAS, which cancelled its contract with Norwegian and forced the smaller 
carrier to compete directly with SAS or go under. "I think they [SAS] regret it now, or at least they should," says Mr 
Kjos, chuckling.

Europe's leading low-cost airlines are thriving in the economic downturn but the region's flag-carriers are finding it 
much tougher.
Amid the European Union's sovereign debt crisis, consumers and business people are saving money when 
travelling inside the European Union by flying with budget airlines rather than flag-carriers.
The outcome is manifesting itself in industry results. Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline by revenue, last 
week raised its profit forecast for 2011-12 from EUR440m ($577m) to EUR480m. By contrast, Lufthansa, Europe's 
largest flag-carrier by revenue, issued a profit warning last September.Air France-KLM, the second-largest flag-
carrier, said in November it expected to report an operating loss in 2011.
Furthermore, the low-cost carriers are well-placed to exploit the collapse of some of Europe's state-backed airlines.
Ryanair on Friday announced it would open an operating base in Budapest - just hours after Malev Hungarian 
Airlines, Hungary's flag-carrier, ceased operations because its finances had become unviable.
Ryanair was able to pounce after grounding 80 aircraft this winter in response to high fuel prices, and the Irish 
airline is putting four Boeing 737 jets into Budapest.
"Grounding 80 aircraft this winter has provided Ryanair with the rapid response unit that can exploit market 
openings like this," says Joe Gill, analyst at Bloxham.
Europe's flag-carriers take a dive
Ryanair is also considering expanding services in Barcelona after the collapse this month of Spanair, a carrier 
based in Catalonia's regional capital. Spanair ceased flying after failing to secure funds from the Catalonian 
administration.
Analysts predict more airline failures in Europe because there are simply too many carriers.
Most forecast Europe will be left with three large flag-carriers - Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and International Airlines 
Group, owner of British Airways and Iberia. However, analysts are divided on whether Norwegian Air Shuttle, which 
last month placed an order for 222 aircraft, can join Ryanair and EasyJet in the top tier of European low-cost 
carriers.
A combination of the deteriorating economic environment and high fuel prices is undermining some airlines. In the 
past, flag-carriers might have expected bail-outs from governments, but the Malev and Spanair cases show that 
budget-constrained administrations do not necessarily have the funds.
Geoff van Klaveren, analyst at Deutsche Bank, envisages a combination of airline collapses and industry 
consolidation after estimating that 21 of Europe's top 40 airlines had a market share of less than 1 per cent in 2011 
when measured by the number of seats they provide on the region's short-haul routes.
He highlights how the top five airlines in the US - Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United-Continental, American 
Airlines and US Airways - controlled 86 per cent of domestic seating capacity in 2011. By contrast, the top five in 
Europe - Lufthansa, Ryanair, Air France-KLM, EasyJet and IAG - controlled just 45 per cent of intra-EU capacity.
Mr van Klaveren says Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG will survive because they have profitable long-haul 
networks.
"All of [Europe's] second-tier legacy airlines are at risk," he adds. "It is quite difficult to see how they will be viable in 
the long term."
Some second-tier carriers with a niche role may survive by combining with one of the three big groups.
For example, IAG is interested in buying Transportes Aereos Portugeses, the Portuguese flag-carrier that is due to 
be privatised, because it has a strong long-haul network to Brazil.
"[European flag-carriers] that do not have strategic relevance like Malev will be under extreme pressure," says 
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland.

Body
Malev, the state-owned Hungarian airline, ceased operations early on Friday after Dublin and Tel Aviv airports 
refused to give its aircraft permission to take off because of unpaid debts.
The move, which ended almost 66 years of continuous service by the airline, came days after Hungary granted 
Malev the status of a "strategically important" company, to protect it from bankruptcy proceedings.
Low-cost rivals were quick to take advantage of the state airline's grounding. Both Ireland's Ryanair  and Wizz Air , 
the Hungarian low-cost airline that is central Europe's largest air carrier, announced plans on Friday to boost 
operations in Hungary.
Malev was the second European carrier to collapse in a week, after Spain's Spanair ceased operations on January 
27.
Lóránt Limburger, Malev's chief executive, said that while there had been prospects for continued operation earlier 
this week, business partners had lost trust in the airline because of media reports, and had begun to demand 
payments in advance.
"This speeded up the cash outflow and the situation of the airline became untenable," he said.
Malev operated 22 aircraft and was 95 per cent owned by the state. The airline had run up debts of Ft60bn 
($272m). In addition, the European Commission ruled last month that Malev had received about Ft100bn in illegal 
state aid, which it would have to repay.
Malev grounds fleet over unpaid debts
Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister, lamented on Hungarian radio that the airline's collapse was "painful", 
and although a profitable carrier should be part of the national economy, any replacement would be founded using 
private money.
Within two hours of news of the airline's collapse, Wizz Air offered tickets to stranded passengers for an all-in price 
of Ft9,900 ($45) to destinations where it formerly competed with Malev, including Rome, Paris and London.
"This is a genuine attempt to offer help to passengers in difficulty," said Jozsef Varadi, Wizz Air's chief executive at 
a press conference in Budapest.
In addition, Wizz Air would add two new aircraft to its fleet based in the Hungarian capital, boosting the number of 
flights per week from the current figure of 67 carriers to 129 carriers and increasing the number of passengers from 
1.4m in 2011 to an expected 2m this year, he said.
Mr Varadi added that the expansion had been planned before Malev's demise, and while the budget carrier was 
interested in some former Malev destinations, particularly Tel Aviv, Moscow, Kiev and Istanbul, it had no intention of 
replicating Malev's role as a legacy carrier.
Ryanair said it would now open 31 routes from Hungary this year, rather than the five it had planned before the 
Malev grounding.
Ryanair will begin operations on February 17 and expects to be flying the majority of its routes by April, with four 
aircraft operating from Budapest offering capacity for up to 2m passengers annually.
The new flights will partially offset the reduction in traffic caused by the loss of Malev at Budapest Liszt Ferenc 
Airport, owned by Hochtief, the German infrastructure group, and four financial investors.
Malev was responsible for 40 per cent of revenues at the airport last year, when it handled a record 9.2m 
passengers.

EasyJet, the low-cost carrier, has been fined by a Paris court for charging passengers extra when they pay with 
some types of credit card and for a raft of "unclear" and "ambiguous" terms and conditions.
The court ordered EasyJet to pay EUR30,000 in damages and interest after finding 23 of the carrier's terms and 
conditions either "illegal" or "abusive".
Cédric Musso of UFC-Que Choisir, the French consumer group that brought the action, hailed the decision as "a 
victory for European consumers but only one step forward because there are so many airline abusive clauses".
Mr Musso said his association was waiting for the outcome of similar legal complaints filed against Ryanair and Air 
France.
EasyJet said: "We will study the court's decision in detail before deciding on next steps ... EasyJet prides itself on 
its transparency and delivers great value to its passengers."
In its 57-page judgment, the court found that the policy of charging a supplement for bookings made with some 
types of credit card was illegal. It also found illegal EasyJet's stipulation that the English version of its terms and 
conditions takes precedence over the French translation.
It gave the carrier two months to drop the offensive clauses or pay a fine of EUR150 per clause for each day of 
delay.
EasyJet fined by Paris court
Terms deemed abusive included a lack of transparency over the cost of checking in baggage and attempts by the 
airline to absolve itself of all responsibility for errors in its timetable.
Erkia Nasry, lawyer for UFC-Que Choisir, told the Financial Times the judgment was "relatively satisfactory and a 
step in the right direction". Too often airlines pleaded that their terms were dictated by security considerations, she 
said, and the court's "de-linking" of conditions that did not relate to security was "a great advance".
Surcharges have proved important to growth for budget carriers in recent years, as the pace of passenger growth 
slows. Higher baggage fees and booking charges helped EasyJet beat market expectations for first-quarter 
revenues last week, sending the share price up more than 10 per cent to a one-year high.
But regulators are stepping up action over these fees. In the UK, the Treasury is aiming to ban excessive charges 
and "hidden last-minute payments" on purchases by credit and debit card by the end of next year, a move that 
would affect online retailers and transport groups. That would put Britain two years ahead of wider EU legislation.
The Office of Fair Trading, which has an open investigation into card surcharges, has secured voluntary 
agreements from some airlines, including EasyJet, to improve transparency of charges.
It is not the first time EasyJet has been fined in France. Last month, a Paris court levied  EUR70,000 against the 
carrier for preventing three unaccompanied wheelchair users from boarding a plane at Charles de Gaulle airport 
near Paris, citing safety concerns. A lawyer for the three passengers described it as a "landmark ruling".

Ryanair is claiming vindication over its decision to ground aircraft this winter, as Europe's largest low-cost airline by 
revenue on Monday raised its full-year profit guidance and outlined plans to return at least EUR500m to 
shareholders.
The Irish carrier has raised fares after grounding 80 aircraft in October, and now expects to generate a net profit of 
EUR480m in 2011-12, compared to previous guidance of EUR440m.
Ryanair paid a maiden dividend of EUR500m in 2010, and Howard Millar, finance director, said the airline was 
planning a similar pay-out during 2012.
He also held out the prospect of a share buy-back after saying Ryanair was seeking shareholder authorisation for 
the right to purchase some of its American Depositary Receipts.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, last year raised the possibility of a third special dividend during 2014 or 
2015 in the absence of new aircraft orders, but Mr Millar said no decisions had been taken. The airline's shares 
were down 1 per cent at EUR4.1 in afternoon trading.
Ryanair is benefiting from the economic downturn, as consumers seek to save money by switching from flag 
carriers to low-cost airlines.
Mr Millar said Ryanair should also gain additional pricing power from consolidation and failures in the European 
airline industry, and noted the collapse of Spanair, the Spanish airline, on Friday.
Ryanair lifts full year profit forecast
"Fewer competitors is generally good for us," said Mr Millar. "It will help with improving average fares."
Ryanair reported an average fare of EUR40 during its third quarter of 2011-12, up 17 per cent compared to the 
same period in 2010-11.
The increase was largely made possible by Ryanair's decision to cut seating capacity and therefore offer fewer 
discounted fares on its routes.
Ryanair grounded aircraft in response to high fuel prices, and this winter is the first time that it expects to see a 
decline in the number of passengers carried.
It carried 16.7m passengers during the three months to December 31, down 2 per cent compared to the same 
period in 2010.
Ryanair reported revenue of EUR844m in the third quarter, up 13 per cent year-on-year, and pre-tax profit of 
EUR15.5m, compared to a loss of EUR12.7m during the same period in 2010.
It recorded basic earnings per share of EUR1.02, compared to a loss per share of EUR0.69 one year ago.
Profit was boosted by December's mild weather, because Ryanair did not have to grapple with costs stemming from 
the snowy conditions in Europe in late 2010.
The airline's unit costs rose 11 per cent, mainly because of an 18 per cent increase in fuel charges.
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Execution Noble, said Ryanair's strong revenue performance validated its decision to cut 
capacity this winter.

Less can be more. Low-cost carriers tend to fare better than their full-service rivals in recessions, thanks partly to 
lower dependence on corporate travel and higher starting-points for their operating margins. But a big part of the 
trick is managing capacity and, longer-term, being in the right place to pick up business as the industry shrinks.
Ryanair has been helping things along. It grounded 80 aircraft - almost 30 per cent of its fleet - this winter, with the 
result that its passenger traffic, year-on-year, fell by 2 per cent for the first time in its history. But this, in turn, helped 
the carrier push up its average fare by 17 per cent, to EUR40, in the third quarter to end-December. Revenue rose 
13 per cent, and, with costs (excluding fuel) well controlled, the airline made an unexpected EUR15m after-tax profit 
compared to consensus expectations of a EUR16m loss. Full-year guidance goes up by 9 per cent, to EUR440m.
All those jets - plus another 12 deliveries - will be flying again over the summer. But Ryanair expects to repeat the 
grounding strategy next winter - which is lousy for second-home owners dependent on Ryanair schedules, but 
bullish for pricing. And in the meantime, the carrier looks well positioned to capitalise on industry shrinkage: 
Spanair's demise, for example, could offer opportunities out of Barcelona, and the clouds over bmibaby's future let it 
entrench further in the UK's Midlands.
The extent to which shareholders benefit is another matter. Ryanair shares, trading on a forward earnings multiple 
of over 11 times, have doubled from 2008 lows but are no higher than in 2002. Increasing its share of intra-
European flights may, Ryanair predicts, permit longer-term annual growth of 4-5 per cent - respectable but hardly 
exciting. Still, there is talk of an ADR buy-back programme and a second special dividend in 2013. For the airline 
business, at least, that's not bad.

The decision to ground 80 aircraft over the quiet winter season has paid off for Ryanair, leading Europe's leading 
low-cost airline by passenger numbers to increase its full-year profit expectations for the second time in three 
months.
The 2 per cent cut to capacity, combined with fewer snow-related flight cancellations in the three months to 
December 31, helped the Dublin-based airline increase total revenues for the third quarter by 13 per cent to 
EUR844m.
The positive figures prompted the Irish budget carrier to increase its expected net profit by EUR40m to EUR480m 
for the 12 months to March 31.
The upgrade by Ryanair follows a previous increase in November that came on the back of stronger-than-expected 
growth in unit revenues in the first half.
"The European Union recession, higher oil prices, the unfolding failure of the package tour operator model, 
significant competitor fare increases and capacity cuts, have created enormous growth opportunities for Ryanair, as 
large and smaller airports across Europe compete aggressively to win Ryanair's growth," said Michael O'Leary, 
Ryanair chief executive.
The Irish budget carrier raised average fares - which include baggage fees - by 17 per cent year-on-year in the 
quarter, in spite of the squeeze on consumers' wallets.
Ryanair lifts full year profit forecast
The favourable conditions pushed Ryanair to a EUR14.9m post-tax profit for the period compared with a EUR10m 
loss in the corresponding quarter in 2010, when Europe's carriers were beset with widespread airport closures, 
flight cancellations and de-icing delays due to snowfall.
However, costs at the airline rose by 11 per cent during the period, mainly due to an 18 per cent increase in the 
price of fuel.
Edward Stanford at Oriel Securities said that Ryanair's figures were "better than expected" and added: "The 
continuation of strong earnings momentum and the prospect of further capital returns should support relative share 
price outperformance in our view."
During the quarter ancillary revenues - such as checked baggage and priority boarding fees - grew 6 per cent to 
EUR177m, and the group introduced its reserved seat service to all routes from January 10.
Shares in Ryanair rose by 11 cents, or 2.7 per cent, to EUR4.26 in early Monday trading, valuing the carrier's equity 
at more than EUR6bn.

Fidelity has become the first major UK fund management company to back calls for a more comprehensive 
measure of investment charges - in an attempt to "restore trust", and end "hyperbolic and inconsistent 
comparisons".
Its announcement came a day before the launch of a new campaign for greater transparency over the fees levied 
on retail investors, supported by Which?, the consumer group, Lord McFall, the former Treasury select committee 
chairman, and Tim Jones, the chairman of the government's National Employee Savings Trust pension scheme.
Wealth manager SCM Private, which is coordinating the campaign, is one of a number of smaller investment firms 
to have argued that current practice is misleading.
At present, fund managers are required to quote an annual management charge (AMC) and a total expense ratio 
(TER) for all their retail funds. However, the AMC excludes administration costs, audit fees and custody charges, 
which are also deducted from investors' holdings. A TER will include these costs, but exclude the funds' dealing 
commissions and stamp duty - leading some to argue it is not "total".
Last December, TCF Investments, another specialist asset manager, gave a presentation to officials at the 
Treasury, highlighting 16 separate fund charges - not all of which were detailed to investors. These were later cited 
by Ed Miliband, the opposition leader, as justification for a new watchdog to force the disclosure, or capping, of the 
costs paid by pension savers.
At the time, David Norman, founder of TCF, wrote to the chancellor calling for a review of the UK retail fund sector, 
similar to the Myners Review of institutional investment, and proposing a new measure of total costs.
Fidelity backs fund charges shake-up
Fidelity is instead seeking an industry agreement on a new standardised measure, called Total Cost of Ownership 
(TCO) - including all deductions, financial advice fees and fund platform distribution costs.
Gary Shaughnessy, Fidelity's UK managing director, said: "We are seeing selective and partial 'Ryanair' pricing 
start to emerge, which runs the risk of misleading investors about the real costs they are paying. A consistent way 
of showing charges is essential to restoring investors' trust in the industry and encouraging them to feel confident to 
save for the future. . . the current debate on charges is a healthy one, but many comparisons are misleading and 
suffer from hyperbole."
Fidelity calculates that, on top of any initial charges, the average TCO for a typical actively-managed fund managed 
works out at 2 per cent a year - although the fund manager may charge only 0.75 per cent for running the fund.
Gina Miller, co-founder of SCM Private, welcomed Fidelity's intervention, ahead of her firm's proposals for a new 
code of conduct and fee labelling system. "As an industry, we need to come together on a solution that benefits 
consumers, not ourselves," she said. "I'm very pleased Fidelity and others have joined us on a trail we started two 
and half years ago."
However, others argued that existing measures only needed to be amended to provide investors with a fair cost 
comparison. "If the TER was just amended to include funds' share-dealing charges, you're basically there, without 
the need for all this controversy," argued Ben Yearsley of fund platform Hargreaves Lansdown.

The fragility of some of Europe's airlines was highlighted on Monday when Malev Hungarian Airlines, the state-
controlled Hungarian flag-carrier, declared that its finances were "unviable".
The Hungarian government is preparing to restructure Malev after designating it a strategically important asset.
But the airline's predicament underlined the rising pressure on some European carriers as they grapple with a 
deteriorating economic environment, high fuel prices and intensifying competition.
Spanair, the Spanish airline, is preparing for insolvency after the Catalan regional government, its controlling 
shareholder, refused to provide it with more funding.
Analysts warned of further airline failures after Spanair suspended operations on Saturday.
"We would highlight that a similar risk remains with a number of other state carriers, notably in central and eastern 
Europe, with further consolidation and potentially further failures very much on the cards," said Eamonn Hughes, 
analyst at Goodbody.
The European market is concentrating around five large airlines - Air France-KLM, International Airlines Group, 
Lufthansa, EasyJet and Ryanair - said Howard Millar, finance director at the Irish low-cost carrier.
Lorant Limburger, Malev's chief executive, told a board meeting on Monday that "despite the continually improving 
commercial results, the financing of activities had become unviable and was unresolved from the end of January", 
according to a statement by the airline.
Pressure shows on Europe's frail airlines
It added that the board had instructed management "to draw up - by the end of the week - a new liquidity plan".
In its latest available set of accounts, for 2010, Malev recorded a net loss of Ft24.6bn ($126m). The carrier employs 
2,600 staff and has a fleet of 22 aircraft.
The European Commission concluded this month that Malev had benefited from illegal state aid, and ordered the 
Hungarian government to recover an unspecified amount of funding provided to the carrier between 2007 and 2010.
The Hungarian ministry of national development responded by saying it would do its best "to sustain the airline's 
uninterrupted operation", adding that discussions with a "strategic investor" were in progress.
Efforts to save Spanair foundered partly because the Catalan government failed to persuade Qatar Airways, the 
Gulf carrier, to invest in the airline.
SAS, the struggling Scandinavian carrier that has an 11 per cent stake in Spanair, said on Monday that it expected 
to report a pre-tax loss for 2011 because the Spanish airline was filing for bankruptcy.
Previously, SAS had forecast a "marginally positive" pre-tax profit. Shares in SAS closed down almost 5 per cent.
Neil Glynn, analyst at Credit Suisse, said Spanair's demise may help IAG - owner of Iberia - in its controversial 
efforts to establish a low-cost carrier in Spain. Iberia has been hit by pilot strikes over the plans.

Catalonia's dreams of running its own airline crashed over the weekend after the indebted Spanish region was 
forced to cut loose Spanair, its loss making domestic carrier, leaving thousands stranded in airports across the 
country.
Spanair, Spain's fifth-largest carrier by passengers, will this week file for bankruptcy protection after grounding 
flights on Friday as a last-ditch attempt by the Catalan government to secure investment from Qatar failed.
An estimated 22,000 passengers have been affected by the collapse, and more than 2,000 employees will lose 
their jobs at a time when the country's jobless rate last week rose to 5.27m, or almost 23 per cent.
Spanair, created in mid-1980s by SAS, the Scandinavian airline, was taken over by the Catalan state in 2009 as 
part of a drive by the region's government at the time to secure the Barcelona El Prat airport's status as an aviation 
hub to rival Madrid's Barajas.
Spanair, which faced competition from pan-European low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, as well as Vueling, Iberia's 
medium-haul subsidiary, racked up large losses and was dependent on vast cash injections from the Generalitat to 
stay afloat.
Catalonia, chafing under outstanding debts of EUR38.2bn, the highest of any of the country's 17 autonomous areas 
according to the Bank of Spain, has been forced to implement austerity measures, and clashed with a central 
government threatening to impose harsh sanctions on overspending regional governments.
Catalonia cuts lossmaking Spanair loose
The collapse of Spanair, which lost EUR115m in 2010, had received EUR150m in funds from the Catalan 
government and the city of Barcelona since 2009, is likely to leave both institutions facing large losses.
Artur Mas, president of the Catalonian government, said that every effort had been made to save the airline, 
including the failed overtures to Qatar.
The airline had been in "a very advanced process of finding a financial partner," Ferran Soriano, Spanair chairman, 
told Spanish state television, "but we were told by the regional government that it could not finance our operations 
any more, and that Qatar would not invest".
SAS, which retains a 10.9 per cent stake in Spanair, on Friday night issued a profits warning, reporting that it had 
remaining exposure to Spanair of SKr1.8bn ($266m), and would write down outstanding debts of EUR165m related 
to the company.
In 2008 a Spanair flight crashed during take-off in Madrid, killing 153 passengers on board, and dealing a further 
blow to the loss making airlines fortunes.
Spain's ruling Popular Party supported the decision to pull the plug on Spanair, arguing that the company had 
struggled on during the financial crisis while other sectors had suffered due to its public sector support.
Spain's ministry responsible for transport said that it would consider taking legal action against Spanair which could 
result in fines of up to EUR9m for breaching its obligations to passengers.

EasyJet's move to target more affluent and business travellers enabled it to increase the average amount it charged 
per seat, pushing up shares in the low-cost airline by 10 per cent.
Europe's second-largest budget carrier by revenues increased the average price per seat by almost 10 per cent 
year-on-year to £51.83, in spite of the squeeze on consumers' incomes.
The figure includes the cost of the seat - which rose year-on-year by 6.5 per cent to £40.29 - with the remainder 
coming from "ancillary revenues" such as fees for checked bags, insurance, speedy boarding and booking fees.
The increase in prices pushed up total revenues by 16.7 per cent for the three months to December 31, aided by 
the strength of the Swiss franc as well as a lack of winter weather-related disruptions.
The news was viewed positively by the City, which bolstered shares in EasyJet by 10 per cent, or 29.3p, to 443.1p 
in early London trading.
Although noting that the "economic environment remained weak", Carolyn McCall, EasyJet chief executive, 
attributed the stronger figures to a "firm control of costs, the strength of EasyJet's network, tight capacity discipline 
and pricing actions taken in the second half of last financial year".
"The good performance in the quarter has meant we are cautiously confident in our outlook for the business," she 
said.
Business travel boosts EasyJet revenues
The increase in revenue per seat would enable the carrier to recover most of the £100m increase in its first-half fuel 
bill and cap its interim losses to £140m-£160m, EasyJet said. This compares with a £153m loss in the first half last 
year.
The number of passengers carried in the quarter rose by 8.1 per cent to 12.9m, which was mostly due weather-
related disruptions in the same quarter the previous year.
EasyJet's load factor - which measures the level of passenger occupancy on aircraft - increased by 0.9 percentage 
points to 87.6 per cent.
The airline is attempting to improve the quality of its brand, and last year it introduced flexible date fares in an effort 
to woo business travellers and further differentiate itself from Ryanair, its larger rival European budget carrier.
EasyJet on Thursday said that 200,000 more business passengers flew with the airline during the quarter compared 
with the same period in 2010, in spite of a decline in the business travel market.
The group is also poised to introduce a system of reserved seating rather than its traditional open seating model, 
which uses the logic that competition for seats gets passengers aboard more quickly and produces faster turnround 
times.
The airline's board was in the headlines last year due to its ongoing dispute with Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the 
company's founder and largest shareholder.
In September, EasyJet announced that it would pay maiden dividends worth £190m in 2012 - a move that was seen 
as a victory of sorts for Sir Stelios, who spent the past three years pushing for the airline to curb its fleet expansion 
and focus on returning cash to shareholders.

Norwegian Air Shuttle plans to buy 222 new aircraft worth $21.1bn from Boeing and Airbus in a move that heralds 
its ambition to become one of Europe's leading low-cost airlines.
Boeing secured its largest ever European deal through a firm order by the Olso-based airline for 122 737 narrow-
body aircraft, worth $11.4bn at list prices.
Norwegian also departed from its previous policy of only operating Boeing aircraft by making a commitment to 
purchase 100 A320 narrow-body aircraft from Airbus, worth $9.7bn at list prices.
Analysts said Norwegian's orders looked like a bet on the demise of SAS, the struggling Scandinavian carrier.
Norwegian's shares closed up almost 13 per cent at NKr74.5. Shares in SAS dropped 1 per cent to SKr9.
Bjorn Kjos, Norwegian's chief executive and one of its founders, told the Financial Times that the airline would focus 
its expansion on Nordic countries, although he highlighted plans to open a new operating base this March in 
Malaga, Spain.
"If we have the newest equipment and one of the best cost bases in the world, we can more or less set up 
operations wherever we want," said Mr Kjos, a former fighter pilot in the Norwegian air force, who is also a lawyer 
and author of a spy thriller.
Mr Kjos also highlighted Norwegian's plans to begin long-haul operations next year, with flights linking Scandinavia 
with Asia and the US.
Norwegian budget line orders 222 new aircraft
Norwegian started its low-cost carrier operations in 2002. It has operating bases in Norway, Denmark, Finland and 
Sweden, although Norwegian's routes reach beyond Europe into north Africa and the Middle East.
Its fifth largest shareholder is Finnair, Finland's flag carrier.
Aircraft financing has become more difficult to obtain since the financial crisis, but Mr Kjos expressed confidence 
that Norwegian's orders with Boeing and Airbus would secure loan guarantees from European and US export credit 
agencies.
Norwegian's orders should increase its fleet from the current 64 to between 150 and 200 by 2020, because some of 
the new aircraft will replace existing ones.
Ryanair, Europe's leading low cost airline by passenger number, has 277 aircraft, while Easyjet, the second largest, 
has 204.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at RBS, said Norwegian's orders looked like "a gamble on SAS failing".
The deals with Boeing and Airbus underline how airlines are keen to buy fuel-efficient aircraft because of high oil 
prices.
Norwegian is buying planned new aircraft that should burn between 10 and 15 per cent less fuel than existing ones.
Airbus will start delivering its A320 Neo aircraft to Norwegian in 2016, and Boeing will begin supplying its 737 Max 
jets in 2017.
Boeing on Wednesday announced strong fourth-quarter results, although it said profitability would be dented in 
2012 by higher pension costs.

Shares in Turkish Airlines rose yesterday after the group said it was looking at buying LOT, but some analysts said 
they saw little logic in a deal to take control of the lossmaking Polish flag carrier.
The Turkish flag carrier said it had authorised its executive committee to carry out a "pre-examination of the 
privatisation process and investment potential of LOT" - a formal step that went beyond a 2010 expression of 
interest in the Polish group by Temel Kotil, chief executive.
His group has expanded rapidly, increasing its now 180-strong fleet by more than 50 aircraft in the past three years 
and spending a record amount on advertising in a bid to raise its profile.
Shares in Turkish Airlines, which is 49 per cent state-owned, rose yesterday by more than 3 per cent on the 
Istanbul Stock Exchange, but some analysts expressed concern about the debt levels, potential profitability and hub 
management of a  merged group.
The company's net debt  increased from TL4.2bn in 2010 to TL7.1bn at the end of the third quarter last year and 
currency weakness brought profits for the third quarter down to TL77m, with the airline recording a net loss of 
TL467m over the first nine months of the year.
"In this difficult time I don't think such an acquisition would be necessary," said Erdem Haf zoglu at BGC Partners in 
Istanbul, emphasising the impact of high oil prices and mediocre economic growth in European markets on which 
Turkish Airlines depends. "I don't believe they are in need of another hub right now."
Turkish Airlines eyes LOT purchase
The Polish state, which owns 93 per cent of LOT, has been seeking to privatise the carrier for several years - LOT 
has forecast losses of ZL50m in 2011.
Magdalena Kobos, Treasury Ministry spokeswoman, told the FT that Turkish Airlines representatives had discussed 
the matter in Warsaw in December. She added there was also another potential bidder for LOT, which she said 
wanted to remain anonymous but has been described as publicly listed.
Although a timetable for discussions has not yet been set, Poland wants to wrap up the deal by the end of the year.
Ms Kobos also cautioned that there was as yet no decision on the size of the sale. The government would have to 
take LOT off a list of strategically important companies to sell more than a 50 per cent  stake.
Founded in 1929, making it one of the world's oldest airlines, LOT faces two challenges. It is too small to compete 
for long-distance traffic against large carriers such as its Star Alliance partner, Lufthansa, and faces stiff competition 
from budget airlines such as Ryanair and Hungary's Wizzair on short-haul routes.
Meanwhile, Turkish Airlines has sought to capitalise on the country's activist foreign policy, so much so that last 
year it announced plans for new routes to Misrata and Mogadishu in the wake of Turkish government efforts to 
improve ties with Libya and bring aid to Somalia.

RBS sells aircraft leasing business for $7.3bn

Royal Bank of Scotland last night finalised the sale of its aircraft leasing business to one of Japan's largest banks 
for $7.3bn in the biggest single disposal since the state-backed bank's government bail-out in 2008.
The deal with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, was struck late on Monday after months of talks with a number of 
interested buyers, including China Development Bank, the state-owned lender and Wells Fargo, the US bank.
For RBS, it ends a two-year attempt to sell a business that leases around 250 commercial jets to airlines around the 
world. RBS was forced to halt early plans to dispose of the division in 2009 after asset values plummeted.
While the aviation business has been a profit engine for the bank, it has particularly onerous funding requirements, 
making it difficult to retain as RBS moves to reduce its exposure to the wholesale markets. RBS is set to record a 
profit of about $300m on the sale over the book value of the business.
The division was founded in 2001, when RBS acquired International Aviation Management Group - a small aircraft 
advisory and finance business - as a first step into the lucrative aircraft leasing business. It was moved into RBS's 
sprawling non-core division three years ago.
The business attracted strong interest from international banks and private equity buyers as it is expected to 
provide long-term stable returns as long as the owner can meet the funding requirements.
Sumitomo is thought to have offered one of the highest prices and convinced RBS that it would be best placed to 
complete the transaction, according to people familiar with the auction.
RBS sells aircraft leasing business for $7.3bn
The sale would be the largest yet for Rory Cullinan, who heads RBS's non-core division and has whittled down its 
unwanted assets from a peak of £258bn in 2009 to less than £100bn.
RBS Aviation Capital is the seventh-largest aircraft lessor in the world by fleet size, with 246 jets, according to 
December data by Ascend, the consulting firm. It competes with lessors led by GE and International Lease Finance 
Corp, and its clients include British Airways, EasyJet, Qantas and Ryanair.
The aircraft leasing industry has come to the fore after several aviation downturns. Lessors' ownership of the 
world's civil aircraft fleet has increased from 12 per cent in 1990 to 36 per cent in 2010, according to Boeing, the 
plane maker. Analysts said much of the growth was happening in Asia, where passenger numbers are growing fast.
Some aircraft lessors are predicting their share of the global fleet will rise to as much as 50 per cent by 2015, partly 
because some airlines may find it harder to secure financing for their jets. Lessors make most of their money 
through the charges paid by airlines that use their jets.
RBS shares, which have fallen nearly 40 per cent in the last year, on Tuesday opened up 4.4 per cent at 25½p.

One of the UK's few publicly owned airports has not ruled out a part-privatisation to raise money for acquisitions but 
said it was "unlikely" to join the bidding for Edinburgh airport.
Charlie Cornish, chief executive of MAG, the second biggest airport operator in the UK, said it would look at all 
opportunities but was not keen on Edinburgh, put up for sale by owner BAA because of competition rules. "It is 
unlikely we will be making a bid for it. It is slightly on the small side for us," he told the FT in an interview.
"Scotland has 4.5m people and four airports. Within two hours of Manchester there are 28m people." Edinburgh 
handled 9.4m passengers last year, half the level of Manchester.
MAG has nearly completed a strategic review which includes several options for fundraising, including selling a 
minority stake. The 10 local authorities in Greater Manchester own MAG, with 55 per cent in the hands of 
Manchester City Council.
However, it could also team up with other companies. In 2009 it bid for Gatwick airport, also on offer from BAA, 
jointly with Borealis, a Canadian infrastructure fund.
Manchester City Council views the airport as a strategic asset to attract inward investors and has ruled out a sell-off 
in the past.
Mr Cornish said the ownership structure had served the group well, allowing long-term investment. Manchester is 
the only airport outside London with more than one runway and the only one that can accommodate the A380 
superjumbo.
Manchester airport chief looks at options
"Our shareholders are very supportive," he said. "Most decisions are delegated to the board. They are interested in 
economic generation for the region and in the asset value of the group."
He was cautious about any bid for Stansted, which BAA may also have to sell depending on the outcome of legal 
action.
"We would have a look but it is very reliant on low cost and 60 per cent of flights are Ryanair. I would not say we 
would definitely do it."
MAG, which owns Manchester, East Midlands, Bournemouth and Humberside airports, serves about 25m 
passengers annually.
It is aiming to boost the number of lucrative business travellers to lessen dependence on the package holiday and 
low-cost trade that dominates traffic.
Mr Cornish made a fresh attack on the recent rise in air passenger duty. "EasyJet was looking at routes into 
Manchester but went to continental Europe because of the tax. We pay more in aviation taxes than make in aviation 
charges," he said. MAG collected an estimated £228m in tax against £116m in aviation income in the year to April 
2011.
On January 12 George Osborne, launched Manchester's Airport City, a £659m development by MAG to house 
offices, hotels, logistics and manufacturing research centres that aims to create more than 21,000 jobs over 15 
years.
A MAG spokesman said a strategic review had almost finished. "Like any growing business we explore all options 
to fund our growth plans to drive greater shareholder returns."

Heathrow passenger numbers rise

The number of people travelling through Heathrow rose in 2011 as the UK's biggest airport came close to reaching 
its 480,000 limit on annual flights.
BAA, the operator of six UK airports including Heathrow, Stansted and Edinburgh, said it served 108.5m 
passengers last year, a 4.4 per cent rise from the year before, although the increase fell to just 0.9 per cent after 
adjusting for a series of disruptions in 2010, including strikes by British Airways cabin crew, the volcanic ash cloud 
and severe snowfalls.
Heathrow was hard-hit by the disruptions in 2010 but last year it managed a 0.9 per cent underlying rise in 
passenger numbers and a 5.5 per cent growth before disruption-related adjustments.
Last month was the airport's busiest month on record, and John Holland-Kaye, commercial director at BAA, owned 
by the Spanish group Ferrovial, said he was expecting "low single-digit growth" in 2012.
But he warned capacity constraints were curbing the airport's ambitions - which would, he said, in turn have a 
negative impact on the UK economy. "We flew very marginally under the cap [on flights]. The lack of capacity in our 
national hub is making it much harder to grow as an economy."
Howeverl, he expected Heathrow to process more than 70m passengers this year, compared with 69.4m last year, 
helped in part by bigger aircraft making more efficient use of take-off and landing slots.
Passenger volumes shrank at BAA's second London-area airport, Stansted, which Mr Holland-Kaye blamed on a 
difficult leisure-travel market and budget carriers moving their fleets to new bases as growth in the UK slowed. 
Heathrow passenger numbers rise
Stansted's biggest customer, Ryanair, cited rising airport charges when explaining its migration away from the 
airport.
Domestic routes were in decline for BAA's Scottish airports, although connections to overseas destinations helped 
produce an 8.1 per cent increase in passenger volumes, led by double-digit growth at Aberdeen. Glasgow 
processed 5.1 per cent more passengers and Edinburgh 9.2 per cent.
That will add to the appeal of the Scottish capital's airport, which BAA is in the process of selling. UK competition 
authorities ordered BAA to dispose of one of its Scottish airports, but most observers had expected Glasgow to 
come on the block.
Ferrovial is asking for indicative offers for Edinburgh by mid-February and hopes to agree a sale by the summer.

As New Year's resolutions go, EasyJet's is risky. Since its inception, the airline has embraced open seating, using 
the logic that competition for seats gets passengers aboard more quickly, producing faster turnround times which in 
turn help squeeze in more flights per aircraft.
But starting this spring, the low-cost carrier will begin a trial of assigned seating on flights.
EasyJet's scrappier rival, Ryanair, already reserves its choicest seats - in the front two rows and next to exits - for 
passengers willing to pay a surcharge. Ryanair emphasises, however, that the practice does not prolong its 25-
minute turnrounds.
If it did, reserved seating would be dropped, says Stephen MacNamara of Ryanair. "We would not put that 25 
minutes in jeopardy," he adds.
EasyJet, based at Luton airport, also insists it will back away from reserved seating should it damage turnround 
times. Yet its trials underscore a wider trend across commercial aviation - toward greater complexity.
While budget carriers creep toward the business models of traditional full-service airlines by developing premium 
products, the flag carriers are adopting some of the strategies employed by low-cost rivals, in particular by 
"unbundling" perks they once lumped into first-class or business-class fares.
That means passengers reluctant to pay for premium seats but keen to secure, say, free schedule changes or 
access to the first-class lounge can create bespoke seat classes by buying an economy ticket and adding the perks 
a la carte.
Airlines ditch simple model for complexity
For their part, airports are mirroring their airline customers, introducing premium offerings for every step, from 
parking to check-in to security lines to border control. Geoff van Klaveren at Deutsche Bank says: "Airlines want 
that because when they ask people what they don't like about flying, it's not the time on the airplane, it's the hassle 
in the airports they really hate."
In some ways, greater complexity is a natural response to a slowdown in some parts of the industry. Global 
passenger numbers have risen by about 5 per cent a year during the past three decades, a trend that looks set to 
continue. Much of the growth, however, will come from developing countries, meaning that operators in mature 
markets need to work harder for returns.
When they do, passengers should benefit, in turn boosting investors' fortunes. However, there are risks associated 
with added complexity. Airlines have needed to invest in new selling strategies and partners, to make sure that 
travel agents - especially those dealing with lucrative business travellers - understand and consider unbundled 
ancillary services.
"It does add a layer of complexity but as long as the cost of providing the ancillary product is outweighed by the 
incremental revenue then I do think this strategy will be successful," says Mr van Klaveren.
EasyJet's seating project has already cost a few million pounds, for investment in IT, but analysts - while largely 
supportive - are more concerned about whether it might slow turnround times.
Jason Steffen, an astrophysicist at the Fermi laboratories in the US, conducted a number of experiments this year 
to investigate the factors that determine commercial aircraft boarding times.
He questions whether separating out travellers who are quick and efficient - the business travellers, say - from 
those who need more time necessarily improves operating efficiency. "It's like filling up a jar with rocks and sand. If 
you put all the sand in first, you can't fit in the rocks.
"In airports, if you put two slow people next to each other, they might slow each other down, whereas a fast person 
in their midst might speed them up," Mr Steffen adds.

Flybe shares plunged on Tuesday after Europe's largest regional airline announced a fresh profit warning as a 
deteriorating UK air travel market weighs on sales.
The group blamed poor sales during December in particular for creating "a significant shortfall against our revenue 
expectations" in the third quarter ended December 31.
UK domestic air travel, which represents around 70 per cent of Flybe's activity from UK airports, had experienced a 
6 per cent year-on-year decline in the first half of the year, it said. That had swollen to an 8 per cent year-on-year 
fall by the end of the third quarter.
The company added that volumes were stable, so it was growing market share in a declining market.
"The UK domestic market is clearly challenging," said Jim French, Flybe's chief executive. "Under such 
circumstances I believe that maintaining volumes and growing market share at the expense of planned yield 
increases was the correct decision to protect the long term potential of Flybe."
Shares in FlyBe, which floated in late 2010 at a price of 295p, were 24 per cent lower at 52p in early London 
trading.
Investec, the airline's in-house broker, has revised its full-year forecast to a pre-tax loss of £8.5m from a pre-tax 
profit of £6.4m.
Flybe plunges on fresh profit warning
"It's a tricky one - they are doing everything they can but when the tide is going out, it's going out," said Andrew 
Fitchie, an analyst at the broker. "The revenues they've been getting are flat, but they need higher prices to offset 
higher fuel charges.
Last October Flybe shares tumbled by more than a third to a then record low of 65p after the company reported a 
significant slowdown in sales during September.
The following month, Flybe said it was cutting the number of flights it offers in the UK by 6 per cent during winter in 
response to slack demand and rising oil prices. Bigger rival Ryanair is has also grounded aircraft this winter, 
prompted by higher fuel costs.

Flybe shares lost a fifth of their value after Europe's biggest regional airline announced a fresh profit warning as a 
deteriorating UK air travel market weighed on sales.
The group said a particularly difficult December helped create "a significant shortfall against our revenue 
expectations" in the three months to December 31, and warned it would not be able to make up for the miss in the 
final quarter of its financial year.
UK domestic air travel, which represents about 70 per cent of Flybe's business, had experienced a 6 per cent year-
on-year decline in the first half of the year, the company said. That had swollen to an 8 per cent year-on-year fall by 
the end of the third quarter.
"The UK domestic market is clearly challenging," said Jim French, Flybe's chief executive. "Under such 
circumstances I believe that maintaining volumes and growing market share at the expense of planned yield 
increases was the correct decision to protect the long-term potential of Flybe."
Shares in Flybe, which floated in late 2010 at a price of 295p, fell 21 per cent to close at 54p in London.
Investec, the airline's in-house broker, revised its full-year forecast to a pre-tax loss of £8.5m from a pre-tax profit of

tide is going out, it's going out. The revenues they've been getting are flat, but they need higher prices to offset 
higher fuel charges."
Flybe plunges on fresh profit warning
Last October, Flybe shares tumbled by more than one-third to a then record low of 65p after the company reported 
a significant slowdown in sales during September.
The following month, Flybe said it was cutting the number of flights it offers in the UK by 6 per cent during winter in 
response to slack demand and rising oil prices. Bigger rival Ryanair has also grounded aircraft this winter, prompted 
by higher fuel costs.
Mr French said the airline's move into continental Europe was "progressing well", with its Nordic joint venture 
trading in line with expectations.
Flybe consolidated its position as the market leader for UK domestic air travel this quarter, but slackening demand 
meant it did so while watching yields and revenues flatline. It has some scope for further capacity reductions next 
year, and could well benefit from IAG's purchase of BMI British Midland, which might lead to reduced competition - 
giving it an opportunity to raise prices. Nor does its balance sheet spell trouble. But with profits set to move from 
black to red this year, investors seeking short-term lift should look elsewhere.

My 10-year-old daughter no longer believes in fairies. Or so I thought until last month, when I asked her whether 
she still believed in Santa Claus. "Where do you think Christmas presents come from, Daddy?!" she replied.
I then experienced a distinct sense of déjà vu at the European Commission's first Innovation Convention in 
December. It was clear that everyone there loves science. José Manuel Barroso said both publicly and privately 
that he trusts science will in the end solve all our problems, from the current economic crisis to climate change. 
Science was unanimously referred to as the only reliable medicine for sorting out all our traumas and providing 
long-term growth. Such deep faith in science was remarkable, and my heart melted. But there was a catch. It was 
equally clear that policymakers perceive science as something abstract and remote, à la Santa.
The list of speakers at the forum implied that science has little to do with innovation. A couple of practising scientists 
were lost amid chief executives, entrepreneurs, heads of various councils, university presidents and science 
popularisers. The most entertaining speaker was Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, who shared his 
personal vision of innovation: coin-operated toilets and taxing overweight passengers. His antics were at least fun, 
and the one-man-advertising-agency did not hide his intention to promote the airline among potential customers.
Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, Cambridge university vice-chancellor, was the most reassuring about our economic future. 
He reminded the audience several times that he represented an 800-year-old institution. According to Sir Leszek, 
innovation will be fine, so long as everyone follows the model of his 800-year-old institution. Everyone applauded 
his positive attitude at the time of crisis.
Don Tapscott, author of Wikinomics, was the advertised star of the show. He explained to the audience that 
Boeing's Dreamliner - 20 per cent more fuel efficient than earlier models - is possible due to a new business model 
Oh for a eurocrat who understands science
of web networking. He did not bother with such details as better engines and aerodynamics, and the use of new 
composite materials. His message was so well received that, watching the enthusiastic applause given to him by 
officials, I imagined them issuing a mandate that all Commission staff join Twitter and carry a second Blackberry.
My own talk was a waste. I reminded the audience that without scientific discoveries there could be no new basic 
technologies and, without these, scope for innovation was limited. Eventually, we would end up in a great 
stagnation, if we are not there already. I also warned about the emerging technology crisis that stems from chronic 
underinvestment in basic sciences for the past 30 years. Amid other, more acute, crises this has gone unnoticed, 
because it takes decades for scientific discoveries to result in consumer products. Previously, science was high up 
governments' agenda because of external threats but, without them, calls for better funding are doomed to be 
ignored amid cries for lower taxes.
How far I was off the mark can be judged from the following anecdote. At a dinner table, European officials and 
science ministers were curious about my line of work. In 2010 I shared the Nobel prize for physics for my work on 
graphene, an exciting new material with a wide range of potential applications. But graphene was no good as a 
reference.
So, I explained that I was at the start of a long economic chain leading to more powerful computers and gadgets, 
which require smaller and faster transistors. To my surprise, the listeners were well informed. I should not worry - 
one interjected - Moore's law, which says that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years, 
would take care of everything. I felt snubbed. I had no strength to explain that Moore's law is not a law of nature but 
an observation.
What is the moral of my journey? Karl Marx, who was a disastrous revolutionary but a good economist, once stated 
that every nation had the government it deserved. Judging from the Brussels convention, Europe has exactly the 
state of innovation that we deserve.
The writer is the Langworthy & Royal Society (2010 Anniversary) Research Professor at the University of 
Manchester. He won the 2010 Nobel prize for physics

Eyebrows were raised in December when the finance and managing directors of Michael Page, the global 
recruitment company, sold more than £2m worth of shares just weeks ahead of a profit warning that sent the 
company's shares plummeting.
When asked about the timing of the share sales, Michael Page refused to comment, on the grounds that 
management personnel did not need to justify their actions.
But shareholders watch directors dealings closely, taking their actions as a cue of how well a company may or may 
not be doing, and a "no comment" from management may exacerbate a potentially minor situation. News of the 
Michael Page directors' dealings sent the share price down 3 per cent on the day, and 6 per cent by the end of the 
week.
"To investors it [director share disposals] is a reflection that the company is overvalued and that the share price is 
going to go down, or even more seriously that there is a bigger problem," Brian Peart, chairman of the north-east 
region of the UK Shareholders' Association, says.
In the UK there are rules concerning when directors can buy and sell shares of their company, covering closed 
periods before earnings and trading updates. Profit warnings, however, do not fall under closed periods, raising the 
question of whether investors deserve to know more about the nature of director dealings before surprise 
announcements.
On November 17 and 18, Stephen Puckett, finance director, and his wife Amanda sold more than 594,000 shares 
at prices between 376p and 380p. They generated more than £2.25m from the transactions. On November 15 and 
Shareholders concerned by director dealings
16, Charles-Henri Dumon, who runs the company's businesses in Europe, South Africa and North America, also 
sold a total of 130,000 shares at prices between 365p and 369p.
Two weeks later on December 5, Michael Page announced that a significant slowdown in growth rates would weigh 
on full-year profits. The news sent the share price falling more than 6 per cent over the week to 325.7p.
By contrast when Michael O'Leary, the colourful chief executive of Ryanair, recently disposed of 4m shares, or 7 
per cent of his total holdings, and James Osborne, senior independent director at the airline, sold 500,000 shares or 
45 per cent of his holdings before bad news, shareholders were less reactive.
The following Monday, Ryanair released an announcement that its winter traffic would decline 5 per cent. However, 
the news that seat sales had declined had been flagged well in advance by Mr O'Leary and Ryanair, leaving the 
share price unchanged. The company also declined to comment.
The well-publicised incident at Michael Page was not the first time directors have sold or bought shares in such 
circumstances but it underscores an aspect of corporate dealings that investors have little say in and information 
about.
It also demonstrates the impact a director's share disposal may have on the company's market value when it 
comes, together with bad news, as a surprise to skittish investors.
William Claxton-Smith, who worked as a fund manager in the City of London for more than 30 years, says: 
"Certainly it is something that makes people very unhappy when it happens," adding that while there are often 
logical grounds for directors to diversify their funds, "directors need to be very careful and behave in a way that 
doesn't cause any problems".
A spokesperson for an investor organisation in the City told the Financial Times that it is never clear to investors 
whether directors have access to market-moving information before closed periods. "Institutional investors are 
particularly concerned about the general probity around director disposals and whether directors were investing on 
an appropriate basis and not realising value that they shouldn't have realised."
Directors are obligated to seek permission from management before selling or buying shares, adding a level of 
accountability that gives investors an indication that there must have been reasonable motivation for disposals.
However, if regulatory bodies such as the UK Listing Authority or the Financial Services Authority are suspicious, 
the FSA will first examine the basis for the permission granted by a company's board for the director's disposals. 
They will then determine whether the director had market-moving information at the time of trading, and the 
personal circumstances of the individual.
FSA investigators then conduct interviews with members of the company on a voluntary basis and if they find 
grounds for further inquiry, a formal investigation is launched and they are granted formal power to compel 
individuals to be interviewed.
"But you've got to think, if this guy is a finance director, would someone who is that high-profile be that public about 
transactions?" the FSA said.
For investors though, a little more insight into why directors sell shares at unexpected times could go a long way.
An incident recounted by Mr Peart of the UK Shareholders' Association highlights this. Four years ago he divested 
his holdings in National Grid after discovering that the chief executive at the time had sold a large part of his 
holdings in the company. Mr Peart later discovered that this executive had sold shares simply in order to fund his 
daughter's lavish and costly wedding.

Captain Tadeusz Wrona became a Polish national hero last month after a successful emergency landing of his 
Boeing 767 Lot airliner without wheels at Warsaw airport after a landing equipment failure.
Now his chief executive, Marcin Pirog, is trying to achieve a less dramatic but also difficult rescue of the entire 
lossmaking airline.
"We have a difficult task and we aren't being helped by external conditions," says Mr Pirog, who took over at the 
state-owned carrier last year.
Lot and its neighbouring national airlines - CSA of the Czech Republic and Malev of Hungary - are caught in a 
double bind. First, their networks are too small to compete for long-distance traffic against the big carriers such as 
Lufthansa, which draws large numbers of passengers from the region to its hubs in Frankfurt and Munich. Second, 
they face fierce short-haul competition from low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Hungary's Wizzair.
The region's airlines are saddled with debts and most are in the red, a consequence of high fuel prices and falling 
passenger numbers. Many have resorted to selling off subsidiaries, such as catering services, in order to have 
enough cash to continue operating.
Last year Lot carried about 5m passengers and posted a 52m zlotys ($15.3m) net loss. This year appears to have 
been little better, since predictions for a 50m zlotys loss now look optimistic.
Malev generated an operating profit in October for the first time in years, having in 2010 posted a Ft24bn ($102m) 
loss on revenues of Ft90.8bn. CSA lost $33m last year, but this was only a third of the loss it ran up in 2009.
State airlines set hub course for survival
Remaining on state life-support indefinitely is not an option. The European Commission is investigating Malev and 
CSA for allegedly benefiting from improper government aid, and the Hungarian airline faces the possibility of 
repaying EUR332m. Lot has been helped by selling its catering and airport service subsidiaries, which were both 
bought by the state treasury for 230m zlotys.
Privatisation, however, looks almost impossible amid the growing economic gloom. There is little interest from the 
three big European airlines - International Airlines Group, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM - in buying any of the 
government stakes.
Lot is 94 per cent owned by the state, Malev was renationalised by the government last year after a short period as 
a private company, and an effort in 2009 to sell CSA failed, spurring the Czech government to embark on a deep 
restructuring of the troubled airline.
The task of finding a buyer is not hopeless, according to Douglas McNeill, an airline analyst with Charles Stanley, 
the stockbroker. Mr McNeill said the region's airlines retain valuable brands and can act as feeders for larger 
airlines, gathering passengers from their national markets and funnelling them to bigger hubs. "However, it is 
certainly the case that there is not a lot of surplus cash around," he said.
What is going to be much more difficult is trying to carve out a niche as a hub carrier in their own right, although all 
three are trying to do so.
Mr Pirog's vision is for Lot to continue serving four North American destinations, and then to add about five in Asia 
beginning in 2012.
"The model we have chosen is to be an airline with a hub," he said, which would draw west Europeans for Asian 
flights, and pull in passengers from central Europe for North American destinations.
Prague airport also wants to be "a strategic hub between the eastern and western part of the world", said CSA, 
while Budapest aims, more realistically, to be a secondary hub for eastern Europe.
Fundamentally all three need to slim down and cut their cost bases. The airlines are all moving to reduce the variety 
of airliners they use in order to cut maintenance costs - Lot and Malev are opting for Boeing while CSA is shifting to 
Airbus - and are dropping less profitable destinations. Staff numbers are also being cut, with CSA having cut its 
workforce by more than half in the past two years.
However, restructuring attempts are running into opposition from labour unions. This month CSA pilots staged a 
one-day protest to object to a management decision to move about one-third of the airline's fleet to a subsidiary that 
operates holiday charter flights.
"All the airlines in the CEE are facing the same challenges," Mr Pirog told the Financial Times, getting up to check 
his computer after being told that American Airlines' parent had just declared bankruptcy. "Boy, this is a tough 
business," he said with a whistle as he stared at his screen.

'Excessive' surcharges on card purchases to be banned

Airlines and online retailers are to be banned from levying "excessive" and opaque surcharges on card purchases 
next year, in a move being presented by the Treasury as a dose of Christmas cheer for struggling consumers.
Mark Hoban, Treasury minister, will announce today that excessive charges on all forms of payments - not just 
debit cards - would be banned by the end of next year and that it would extend across most retail sectors including 
transport.
"We want consumers to be able to shop around," he will say. "They have a right to understand the charges they 
may incur up front and not be hit through a hidden last-minute payments surcharge."
The move follows a campaign by Which?, the consumer organisation, which claims that airline passengers alone 
pay more than £265,000 a day in card surcharges. It says the Treasury's move represents a "huge victory for 
consumers".
The European Union is already making moves in that direction with a consumer rights directive that includes a ban 
on above-cost surcharges on any form of payment from mid-2014; Mr Hoban says Britain would lead the way and 
introduce the ban by the end of 2012.
"While the law will come into force at the end of 2012, we want companies to be up-front and fair over card charges 
today," said Richard Lloyd, Which? executive director. "Businesses should not drag their feet over this."
'Excessive' surcharges on card purchases to be banned
Which? claims that it costs between 10p and 20p to process a debit card payment, but that airlines and retailers 
often then add a much greater charge on top. To compound the problem, the charge is sometimes not apparent 
until the very end of an online transaction.
The consumer group has singled out low-cost airlines for particular criticism. Ryanair, for example, charges a £6 
"administration fee" per person each way for the use of debit cards.
It wants the Treasury to require retailers to tell consumers about any surcharges upfront "in plain language" and 
wants fees to match the actual cost to retailers or for retailers to absorb the "very small" cost of debit card 
transactions.
The Office of Fair Trading found in June that surcharging for the use of credit cards or debit cards was potentially 
misleading. Mr Hoban has endorsed the finding that the charges were "opaque, misleading and prevent customers 
from getting a good deal".
However, the Treasury declined to speculate on whether the move would end up saving consumers large amounts 
of money, not least if retailers and airlines remove the surcharges and simply add them to the price of the item.

Not so long ago, the airport at Cluj-Napoca in Romania was a rather provincial operation. Outside the summer 
peaks, a handful of flights meant daily traffic was well under 1,000 passengers.
Then four years ago, Wizz Air, the Hungarian budget carrier, began operating flights from Cluj to four major 
European cities: London, Rome, Barcelona and Budapest.
The move triggered a "spectacular evolution" in the airport's history, with passenger numbers almost doubling from 
390,000 in 2007 to 750,000 a year later. In 2010, the figure topped 1m.
"The emergence of the low-cost airlines opened up the market to a much larger segment of the public - which in 
turn stimulated more demand," according to David Cicero, general manager of Cluj-Napoca International Airport.
Wizz Air's arrival in Cluj has brought with it a range of benefits. One has been that it has helped Romanians from 
the region seek work abroad. Another has been to enhance Cluj's position as a regional centre for commerce, 
particularly in the information technology industry.
CSi, the Dutch material-handling systems company, set up a plant in Cluj in 2004. The subsequent arrival of the 
low-cost airlines has been a "great help" for business, according to Daniel Malutan, general manager of CSi 
Romania.
"We produce fully integrated systems for the fast-moving consumer goods and packaging industry and install them 
at the client's site. So travelling, and at an affordable price, is a must," Malutan says.
Transport: budget boom
"At the same time, clients, investors, business partners or ordinary visitors can get to Cluj much more easily."
Similar stories have been played out - with local variations - in dozens of cities across central and eastern Europe in 
the past decade. From Tallinn to Tirana, Prague to Pristina, the liberalisation of the skies - primarily as a 
consequence of expansion of the European Union - has enabled no-frills carriers to "commoditise flying", according 
to Jozsef Varadi, Wizz Air's chief executive.
Along with Wizz Air, the main budget players are Ryanair, EasyJet and Norwegian Air Shuttle, according to Eli 
Abeles, a UK-based aviation consultant. There are also, he says, a number of hybrid airlines, such as 
Germanwings, Airberlin, Jetairfly and AirBaltic, that offer services associated with classical carriers.
The importance of these airlines to central and eastern Europe is evident from the high number of passengers. For 
Brno and Prague in the Czech Republic and Riga in Latvia, low-cost carriers account for 21-23 per cent of 
passengers. For Prague, with close to 12m passengers, that translates into 2.6m low-cost seats. Almost 27 per cent 
of the traffic at Budapest airport this year has come via low-cost airlines, Abeles says. "Bearing in mind Budapest 
also has long-haul and intra-central and eastern Europe services, this means budget airlines may have nearly half 
the market of western European traffic," Abeles says.
But while most see the rise of low-cost airlines as positive, it is by no means a universal view.
The most common complaint is the rise in public drunkenness and loutish behaviour by the large groups of young 
people, many from the UK, who fly into still-relatively cheap eastern European cities.
Mike Johnson, general manager of Patricia, a private tourist office in Riga, complains that not only do passengers 
on budget airlines tend to come on shorter breaks, but that the add-on services available when they book, such as 
hotels and car rental, have reduced business for his tour company.
"Low-cost airline visitors are so busy wandering around for two days they do not bother with guided tours. That's 
more lost business for us," he says.
Nevertheless, the rise of budget carriers has been inexorable - so far. John Stephenson, executive vice-president of 
Wizz Air, is confident that the airline's passenger numbers can continue to rise.
"We have been positively surprised by the development of the Baltic states," he says.
Passenger numbers are predicted to rise by 15 per cent this year, to more than 11m. Yet while 2011 has been 
"better than expected", with the crisis in the eurozone far from over and oil prices also volatile, "we remain 
cautious", Stephenson adds.

Ryanair has changed tack in its battle with Aer Lingus over the Irish flag-carrier's pension scheme, dropping 
demands for an emergency shareholder meeting but threatening legal action should the group, in which it is the 
largest shareholder, agree to help cover the EUR500m deficit.
Accepting defeat in an acrimonious month-long fight for an emergency general meeting, waged through open letters 
to Aer Lingus's board, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, blamed Irish company law. "The shareholders 
can't compel the board to hold an EGM. The only remedy you have is to hold the EGM yourself, and then they can 
ignore whatever resolutions are passed at that EGM," he said.
"Welcome to Ireland. That's why we're bankrupt," he added.
The low-cost carrier, which holds a 29.8 per cent stake in its Dublin-based rival, wants two things of Aer Lingus's 
board: access to a company-commissioned report on a redundancy scheme that led to a EUR30m fine by Ireland's 
inland revenue; and assurances that the group will not make any further payments into a defined-benefit pension 
scheme that was changed to a defined-contribution plan at the time of the airline's 2006 stock market flotation.
Mr O'Leary said that in the case of pension payments "shareholders have clear right of legal action".
Aer Lingus's management agree with their biggest shareholder that no money is owed to cover the pension plan's 
estimated EUR500m deficit. But the company will take part in talks next week over addressing the gap, which 
unions argue the group must fund.
Ryanair drops EGM call over Aer Lingus pensions
Observers suspect Aer Lingus has the stronger legal case. But Joe Gill, an analyst with Bloxham, thinks it is willing 
to pay for a resolution. "They recognise it's an issue that hangs over the company and hangs over the share price," 
he said.
Shares in the group have hovered in the EUR0.70 range for the past six months - compared with EUR2.20 at 
flotation - valuing the equity at just EUR370m, in part because investors fear a pensions settlement would eat into 
the group's more than EUR300m net cash. Mr Gill thinks the ultimate cost could be significantly less than the 
outstanding deficit but believes Ryanair "will continue to campaign that any payment above zero is unacceptable".
Meanwhile, the failure to force an EGM will add ballast to Ryanair's position in relation to an Office of Fair Trading 
investigation over whether it has influence over Aer Lingus.
Aer Lingus on Friday welcomed the decision to drop the EGM request.

Spain's pilots' union has announced that it will strike over the Christmas period in an escalation of an industrial 
dispute triggered by Iberia's plans to establish a new low-cost domestic carrier.
Sepla, which represents pilots working for Iberia, now the Spanish unit of a merged holding company with British 
Airways, voted to strike for two days in December. BA cabin crew walked out last year over moves to cut staff on 
long-haul flights.
Iberia earlier this year announced plans to create Iberia Express, a low-cost carrier designed to trim its costs and 
boost profitability at a time when its short-haul operations are struggling in the face of competition from low-cost 
airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair.
Spain's large network of cross country high-speed trains, combined with well established low-cost airline routes, 
has further weighed on profitability for other airlines.
Sepla, which voted for crews to strike on December 18 and December 29, said it regarded the plan as illegal since 
it was announced because it broke collective agreements made between pilots and Iberia during the merger with 
British Airways to form International Airlines Group.
Rafael Sánchez-Lozano, Iberia's chief executive, has pledged that no staff will lose their jobs after the creation of 
Iberia Express, and that the new entity would not immediately take control over all of the carriers' short and

The company said that it had not broken its agreements, as the wages for Iberia pilots who will transfer to Iberia 
Express will not change. As a result, it argues, the strike is illegal.
However, IAG said that it plans to recruit any new staff for the new operation at "market rates", which could be 
lower than the current collectively agreed contracts, a move it hopes will help cut operating costs at the lossmaking 
short and medium-haul business.
Iberia Express will take four planes from Iberia's stock when it comes into operation next year, with the company 
later lifting the number to 40 by the end of 2015.
Iberia has 68 aircraft in operation for its medium and short-haul flights.
Both Iberia and BA have reported operating losses so far this year as they struggle to trim costs and provide stiffer 
competition for their low-cost rivals.

Spain's pilots' union has announced that it will strike over the Christmas period in an escalation of an industrial 
dispute triggered by Iberia's plans to establish a new low-cost domestic carrier.
Sepla, which represents pilots working for Iberia, now the Spanish unit of a merged holding company with British 
Airways, voted to strike for two days in December. BA cabin crew walked out last year over moves to cut staff on 
long-haul flights.
Iberia earlier this year announced plans to create Iberia Express, a low-cost carrier designed to trim its costs and 
boost profitability at a time when its short-haul operations are struggling in the face of competition from low-cost 
airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair.
Spain's large network of cross country high-speed trains, combined with well established low-cost airline routes, 
has further weighed on profitability for other airlines.
Sepla, which voted for crews to strike on December 18 and December 29, said it regarded the plan as illegal since 
it was announced because it broke collective agreements made between pilots and Iberia during the merger with 
British Airways to form International Airlines Group.
Rafael Sánchez-Lozano, Iberia's chief executive, has pledged that no staff will lose their jobs after the creation of 
Iberia Express, and that the new entity would not immediately take control over all of the carriers' short and 
medium-haul flights.

The Office of Fair Trading has launched an investigation into Groupon after the online deal website broke UK 
advertising regulations 48 times in the past year.
Groupon, which provides discounts on anything from wedding receptions to family meals, was referred to the 
regulatory body by the Advertising Standards Authority. It is the first time the advertising watchdog has taken such a 
move against a big advertiser since its conflict with Ryanair in 2008.
The three-year-old website broke the advertising code, according to the ASA, by exaggerating potential savings 
from its deals, making offers which were not actually available and failing to make clear important terms and 
conditions.
The most recent of the infringements came when Groupon offered £5,000 worth of "breast augmentation" surgery 
for £1,999 if the offer was taken up within the day. The ASA said this was encouraging consumers to rush into 
plastic surgery.
The advertising watchdog made 11 formal rulings of code breaches against Groupon and announced a further 37 
informal breaches.
"Given Groupon's track record, we have serious concerns about its ability to adhere to the advertising code," said 
the ASA.
"It is in the public interest that we refer the matter to the OFT, the OFT being better placed to address any 
underlying issues concerning Groupon's trading practices generally."
UK regulator launches Groupon probe
The announcement by the ASA prompted the OFT to reveal that it was already concerned about Groupon and had 
been conducting a secret investigation into the company since July.
Groupon made headlines last month after raising $700m (£449m) in its initial public offering which valued the 
company at $12.6bn. Following a bullish first day, the stock has slumped 23.6 per cent to $19.96, slightly below its 
IPO price.
In the past client companies have complained about the business model that allows Groupon as much as half of the 
sale price of the already heavily discounted service or product.
Last month, a Berkshire cake maker said that it almost went bust after it offered a 75 per cent cupcake discount and 
was overwhelmed when thousands more people than expected redeemed the vouchers.
The OFT said the investigation was likely to take at least six months, and possibly much longer if the case goes to a 
criminal court.
Groupon said it "constantly strives for business practices that are in the best interest of consumers", adding: "We 
are constantly evolving business process to ensure customers receive the best possible experience at the highest 
standards. We are co-operating fully with the OFT to ensure that the rights of consumers are protected."
Groupon also stressed they moved quickly to address the ASA ruling on their plastic surgery offer, and that they 
now have a three-day expiry rule for such products.

CAA to get power to fine airports

Regulators are to get new powers to fine airports for poor performance, in a move that could help reduce the 
chances of a repeat of last winter's snow debacle at Heathrow.
In the biggest shake-up of the Civil Aviation Authority's role in regulating airports for 25 years, ministers on 
Wednesday published draft legislation that puts an end to conflicting priorities at the watchdog by stating that its 
primary duty is to promote passengers' interests.
The legislation would enable the CAA to subject large airports to a new licensing regime, which could include 
conditions aimed at ensuring they cope with severe weather. Breaches of licence conditions could result in fines of 
up to 10 per cent of airports' turnover.
The CAA said such arrangements could help guard against a repetition of last December's snow problems, when 
thousands of passengers were left stranded after Heathrow airport experienced almost four days of paralysing 
disruption.
"The draft bill would allow the CAA to impose resilience conditions as part of airport licences," said the CAA. 
"Sanctions for breaching these conditions could include financial penalties."
The CAA's economic regulation role is rooted in legislation that dates back to 1986, shortly before BAA, Heathrow's 
owner, was privatised.
The case for reform came to a head in 2009 when the Competition Commission called for the break-up of BAA 
because of its dominance, and criticised the system of economic regulation.
CAA to get power to fine airports
The draft civil aviation bill gives the CAA more clout, and the ability to intervene quickly, by providing it with civil 
enforcement powers for the first time.
Currently, the watchdog must often choose between issuing informal warnings to airports for alleged offences, and 
pursuing criminal cases against them.
The legislation would also enable the CAA to move away from the existing system under which it imposes price 
caps on the charges that Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports levy on airlines for using their facilities.
The proposed licensing regime for airports could mean that the CAA instead imposes performance conditions on 
them rather than price controls.
Gatwick, which is owned by a consortium led by Global Infrastructure Partners, is considering the case for arguing 
that it should be exempted from the licensing regime because it does not wield significant market power.
British Airways welcomed the licensing regime, "backed by proper enforcement powers and regulatory 
accountability".
EasyJet also welcomed the proposed reform, but Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair and a longstanding 
critic of both the CAA and BAA, dismissed it as a "complete waste of time".

Ryanair to offer reserved seating

Passengers across Ryanair's network will be able to reserve seats for a £10 surcharge starting next year, 
underscoring the move by UK-listed budget airlines away from low-cost carriers' traditional open-seating model.
Ryanair began a reserved seating trial this April, allowing customers to book spots in the first two rows or exit rows 
on flights from Dublin and Gatwick airports to Malaga in Spain, and extended the offering to select other routes over 
the year.
The decision to roll out reserved seating - which "has proved to be very popular with Ryanair customers," according 
to the company - to all of its 1,400-plus daily flights follows news that Luton-based rival EasyJet would begin trialling 
designated seating on some flights next spring.
Analysts said reserved seating was worth trying for two reasons: the surcharges push up revenues; and the 
prospect of guaranteed legroom and quick disembarkation helps attract business fliers seeking cheaper flights but 
reluctant to give up all the perks of a journey on a full-service carrier.
"The European low-cost carriers have been [raising revenues through ancillary sales] for many, many years. The 
interesting thing is that they're now using particular ancillaries to target particular customers," said David Doctor at 
travel technology provider Amadeus.
Risks lie in cost and complexity. Carolyn McCall, EasyJet's chief executive, said the company was investing "in the 
low single-digits" of millions of pounds on IT associated with the project, which will contribute to a 2-3 per cent rise 
in non-fuel unit costs at the group.
Ryanair to offer reserved seating
But EasyJet's experiment is more extensive than Ryanair's, as every passenger will be assigned a seat. While 
customers willing to pay extra can guarantee a particular seat, others will simply be placed together if they booked 
together.
Ms McCall stressed that the experiment would be dropped or altered if it increased boarding times - since short 
turnrounds are a key way for airlines to hold down costs. Ryanair says its select assigned seating offerings have not 
increased 25-minute average turnround times.
The two UK-listed budget airlines are diverging from US budget pioneer Southwest, which has stuck with open 
seating. But that is in part because Southwest is already attracting large numbers of business travellers, says Mr 
Doctor: "They haven't needed to reshape their business model to attract those customers."
He added that with US full-service carriers moving aggressively into surcharges for services including baggage 
checking and on-board food - with ancillary revenues growing to account for as much as 14 per cent of sales there. 
"Southwest's strategy is to do the opposite of what every other carrier does".
Geoff van Klaveren, of Deutsche Bank, said that even in Europe "the product differentiation between full-service 
and low-cost carriers is diminishing. It's just the logical evolution".

Robin Hood airport near Doncaster was the last commercial airport to open in the UK. The former RAF base was 
converted by Peel Holdings, the private conglomerate with interests from property to transport. Its long runway, built 
for giant Vulcan bombers, could handle longhaul flights but it has attracted mostly charter traffic.
Opened in 2005, within three years it had 1m passengers annually but that number shrunk to 900,000 in 2010 as 
recession bit.
"The competition is very strong," said Robin Tudor, of Peel Airports.
Robin Hood hosts flights from Tui's Thomson brand, Thomas Cook, Wizz Air, and Ryanair in the summer months.
While it will miss a target of 6m passengers annually by 2016 it still hopes to have 10m passengers annually by 
2030. Some 6m people live within an hour's drive and a new link road from the M1 will put it within 25 minutes of 
Sheffield, a city of 500,000. A railway line runs alongside and there are plans for a station.
"Greater accessibility will attract more airlines," said Mr Tudor. "All the facilities are in place."
By contrast Liverpool, which had been a sleepy charter hub a decade ago, has seen huge growth with £100m 
investment by Peel. It is continuing to expand, with more than 5m passengers in 2010. About 40 per cent come 
from beyond Merseyside, into Manchester airport's traditional territory.
Manchester remains the north's biggest hub with about 20m passengers annually and more than 200 destinations.
Airlines are able to play airports off against each other, to get the lowest charges possible.
Robin Hood airport sets its sights
Ryanair pulled all but two routes from Manchester in 2009, opening a base in nearby Leeds/Bradford airport 
instead. But in July it returned with 13 routes.
Penny Coates, chief operating officer of Manchester Airport, said at the time: "We've seen a decline in passenger 
numbers over the last two or three years particularly since the recession kicked in."
She said the airport had lost Ryanair passengers to Liverpool and to Leeds, adding: "We want those passengers 
back to fly here from Manchester."

Ryanair has renewed its call for an emergency general meeting at Aer Lingus, where the low-cost carrier holds a 
29.8 per cent stake.
The budget airline sent a second letter in two weeks to Ireland's flag-carrier demanding a meeting to vote on two 
resolutions - that the company publish a report into a redundancy scheme that led to a EUR30m ($40m) fine by 
Ireland's inland revenue; and that the board promise not to make any further payments to the group's defined-
contribution pension scheme.
Aer Lingus dismissed Ryanair's earlier letter because the company secretary had not signed it himself, rendering 
the document invalid under Ireland's 1963 Companies Act. "While we do not accept this baseless claim, we prefer 
not to waste further time or resources on it, and accordingly we now enclose a new requisition ... signed personally 
by myself," wrote Julius Komorek, Ryanair's company secretary in a letter dated November 14.
Last week, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement said Ryanair was allowed to call an EGM itself 
should Aer Lingus's board fail to do so within 21 days of a proper request. Now that Ryanair has adjusted its 
request to meet the Companies Act requirements, a meeting is likely within the next three weeks.

So far, so good. Low-cost carriers tend to weather economic downturns better than their more traditional 
counterparts. EasyJet, like Ryanair, is proving no exception this time round. Revenue per seat, in constant 
currencies, increased 3.4 per cent in the year to end-September - it accelerated by 9.4 per cent in the summer 
quarter, more than double its clip of the previous three months. Load factors were stable, amid signs that a growing 
number of cash-conscious business travellers are seeking budget options. Almost one in five EasyJet passengers 
now travels for work. More than half of EasyJet's customers started their flight outside the UK.
But if revenues look relatively resilient, investors have more reason to fret on the cost front. Fuel costs were £184m 
higher in 2011, and will increase by £220m in 2012, EasyJet warns. That will not be the end of the pressures. Unit 
costs excluding fuel and currency factors were slightly lower in 2011 but are expected to increase by 2-3 per cent 
this year. Milking as much revenue as possible from the customer base will be essential - and EasyJet's plan to trial 
fixed seat bookings is a step in that direction.
Given the uncertain outlook, the consensus forecast for 2012 pre-tax profit of £214m is 14 per cent below this 
year's outcome. EasyJet shares, down by more than a fifth this year, trade on a multiple of just under 10 times, a 
discount to Ryanair's 12-plus times, but nothing to get excited about. Investors, of course, have the comfort of the 
£150m special dividend, agitated for by EasyJet's founder and largest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, 
although they may wonder whether the distractions he poses to management are worth it. With economic 
turbulence likely, a firm focus on the controls will be essential.

As anyone who flies to Brussels on a low-cost airline knows, you don't land at your intended destination.
Instead you arrive at "Brussels South Charleroi" airport, an hour's drive to the south of the capital. The airport, 
which has signed deals with several low-cost airlines, including Ryanair, is attracting record traffic at the expense of 
its rivals.
In 2010, 5.1m passengers passed through the airport, a 32 per cent increase on the year before.
Its success comes amid efforts by the regional government to position Wallonia as a low-cost logistics centre, luring 
companies and traffic away from neighbouring regions.
It is a success, however, that threatens to leave the region particularly vulnerable to any slowdown in European 
trade.
Positioned between Germany, France and the Netherlands, Wallonia can present itself as a logistics hub for the 
whole European market. With 60m consumers within a three-hour drive of Liège, the local authorities expect to 
capitalise on companies' renewed drive to centralise distribution as they seek efficiencies in a stagnating European 
market.
Johnson & Johnson, the US pharmaceuticals group, is indicative of this trend. Five years ago it centralised its 
European logistics operations, cutting the number of distribution centres, spanning several countries, from 23 to 
five. It chose to locate its main facilities at Courcelles and La Louvière - the latter consolidating activities previously 
dispersed across 15 European sites - both located near the industrial city of Charleroi.
Logistics: Aim is to build on hub status
The company says several factors were instrumental in the decision to locate in Wallonia. Foremost was the dense 
road network and proximity to North Sea ports. "Wallonia was good in terms of motorways, airports and transport 
companies," Johnson & Johnson says.
"It also had a labour force available to work there. Unemployment is high in the region, and that was important for 
us in terms of recruiting a lot of people in a short time."
Furthermore, Wallonia benefits from a lack of traffic congestion - a problem that affects its northern neighbour, 
Flanders - attracting companies in their drive to lower transport costs.
However, it was the grant offered by the regional government that was "the tipping point", the company adds. In the 
past decade, the regional authority has played an active role in attracting foreign investment, drawing in other 
international companies, such as H&M, the Swedish clothing group.
Since 2000, the logistics sector has created 3,000 jobs, with the industry accounting for 15 per cent of regional 
gross domestic product in 2010.
"As present, Wallonia represents the best-value proposition in Europe for the location of logistics activities," says 
Bernard Piette, general manager of Logistics in Wallonia, a regional trade promotion group.
According to the most recent study by Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm that carries out a 
biennial ranking of European logistics locations, Wallonia is top for market access, location, transport infrastructure 
and cheap land costs.
The sector's success may prove a double-edged sword, however, leaving the region more dependent on European 
trade flows than ever.
A particular worry is the slowdown in the German economy, which, until this autumn, had been the main engine of 
European growth.
Germany ranks third to France and the Netherlands as a destination for Wallonian exports, says Mr Piette. But with 
European demand likely, at best, to stagnate in the short term, the region's logistics industry may face a difficult 
future as manufacturing orders decline.
In an effort to sustain activity in the sector, the regional government has targeted niche areas that require expertise.
The field of "biologistics", which caters for life sciences materials, constitutes a focus for the region, and benefits 
from the presence of such pharmaceutical groups as Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and UCB.
Speed, traceability and reliability are the primary drivers of biologistics, according to Hugues Van Espen, project 
manager of Biolog Europe, a subsidiary of Logistics in Wallonia.
"It is all about developing the concept of biologistics in Wallonia," Mr Van Espen says. "We are trying to bring all the 
actors together - the pharmaceutical, biotech and transport companies working in this environment - to take the 
logistics sector further."

Flybe is cutting the number of flights it offers in the UK by 6 per cent this winter in response to slack demand and 
rising oil prices.
Europe's biggest regional airline, which runs 70 per cent of its flights from UK airports, warned last month that 
trading in September slowed "significantly" and would pull back half-year sales figures.
It said on Wednesday that revenues for the six months to October were 6.4 per cent higher than last year, when the 
volcanic ash disruption dented the performance of airlines across Europe, at £341.6m. That was in line with 
reduced expectations following last month's warning.
Pre-tax profits were £14.3m, down from last year's £19.8m - before taking into account the cost of the ash cloud, 
the group's December 2010 initial public offering and other exceptionals. Accounting for those one-offs, pre-tax 
profits in the last year's first half were just £8.2m.
Passenger revenue per available seat rose by 5.8 per cent to £49.88, boosted by both higher fares and ancillary 
revenues.
Analysts at Espirito Santo called the UK winter capacity cuts "appropriate given the weak and uncertain demand 
outlook, and we believe these ... should support average fares and reduce the volume of unprofitable flying".
Jim French, Flybe's executive chairman, said the advantage of Flybe's high flight frequency meant it could cut 
flights without cutting routes.
Flybe to cut winter timetable
Bigger rival Ryanair is also grounding aircraft this winter, prompted by higher fuel costs. But flag-carriers have been 
less flexible. Nor is Flybe cutting across the board. A joint venture with Finnair, Flybe Finland, is already flying 26 
routes, and Mr French said he expected the Finnish business to drive up capacity across the group by 7 per cent 
this winter from last.
Comment:Flybe's business model means small changes in revenue translate into big swings in the bottom line. This 
year has demonstrated that starkly, and to investors' chagrin, with analysts halving profit forecasts on the basis of 1 
per cent revenue shortfalls and the share price diving accordingly; the group now trades at a forward p/e of 8.5. 
Flybe has responded by cutting variable costs and is actively pushing into continental Europe, where it sees 
opportunities for consolidation. Both efforts should help smooth its performance. But it could also benefit from 
International Airline Group's deal to buy BMI British Midland. If the sale goes through, chances are good IAG's chief 
executive Willie Walsh will cut some of his lossmaking target's regional routes, easing competition for Flybe. Here, 
the disproportional relationship between top and bottom line could prove pleasing.

Ryanair has raised its full-year net profit guidance by 10 per cent on the back of stronger-than-expected growth in 
unit revenues in the first six months of the financial year and capacity cuts in the second half that are set to boost 
those figures further.
Revenues per passenger at the low-cost carrier increased by 11 per cent in the half-year to September 30, pushed 
up by higher average fares, including baggage fees, and "improved product mix" that drove ancillary sales such as 
reserved seating fees and online payment charges.
Still, operating expenses rose more than twice as quickly, driven mostly by higher fuel. The company said it was 
grounding planes in response. "Ryanair's capacity cuts will mean that traffic in H2 will fall by 4 per cent," said 
Michael O'Leary, chief executive. "In November, for example, we expect to report a traffic decline of 10 per cent or 
almost 500,000 passengers as we ground up to 80 aircraft due to higher oil prices."
But there was little sign of slackening demand as he raised full-year net-profit guidance from EUR400m to 
EUR440m based on third-quarter bookings that suggested second-half revenues per passenger-mile - or yields - 
would rise by 14 rather than the previously-forecast 12 per cent.
In the first half, the airline flew 44.7m passengers, 12 per cent more than the same period last year.
Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Espirito Santo, praised Ryanair's capacity discipline and pointed out that it came "in 
contrast to the network carriers that continue to plan capacity growth in 2012, albeit at a slower pace than 
previously expected".
Ryanair lifts profit forecasts despite rising costs
Aircraft were 85 per cent full on average in the six months to September 30, flat from levels seen in the same period 
last year.
Pre-tax profits were 20 per cent higher than last year's underlying figures - which exclude one-off costs related to 
the volcanic ash disruption - at EUR620m, on revenues that were 24 per cent higher, at EUR2.7bn. Diluted 
earnings per share were 30.38 cents compared with 28.50 cents last year.
Shares rose more than 3 per cent in early trading on Monday. "It is somewhat unusual for Ryanair to upgrade 
guidance at the half year stage - they usually hold guidance at Q2 and then allow it to rise at Q3 results," said RBS 
analysts. "We would thus see this as a marked sign of confidence in the outlook."
Mr O'Leary took the opportunity of first-half results to lambast the operators of two of his main bases, Dublin Airport 
and Stansted, for the high fees being charged, and the competition authorities for allowing BAA to delay the sale of 
Stansted, which it was first ordered to carry out two and a half years ago.
He added that the Office of Fair Trading's investigations into Ryanair's influence over Aer Lingus, where it holds 29 
per cent of shares, are "unjustified", citing the Irish flag-carrier refusal last week to hold an emergency general 
meeting called for by Ryanair.

When chief executive Michael O'Leary talks of an "improved product mix", Ryanair's passengers groan: it invariably 
means that the low-cost carrier has found another way to squeeze cash out of them. One of its latest wheezes is a 
EUR10 seat reservation fee. But Ryanair's owners will cheer, because it is one of those rare breeds - a consistently 
profitable airline.
Ryanair raised its full-year profit forecast by 10 per cent on Monday, when it published decent interim figures. The 
revision raises its own projections closer to those of analysts. It is certainly early in the fiscal year to be so bold. But 
the purchase of BMI British Midland by the parent of British Airways last week, mostly for its Heathrow slots, fits 
with Mr O'Leary's theory that flag-carriers are less keen to battle with him in the short-haul market.
That is just as well, because Ryanair faces a big strategic decision in the next two years: whether to expand or to 
return more cash to shareholders. Mr O'Leary's story keeps changing here. In 2009, he called Boeing executives 
"numpties" for failing to agree terms about a 200-aircraft order by which he had hoped to take advantage of the 
latest industry downturn. Then, he said Ryanair would slow its expansion. Last year he hinted at a switch to Airbus 
for new planes. More recently he has suggested a near-doubling of passengers between 2015 and 2021 and 
talking with Chinese and Russian manufacturers.
Expansion has to be the more likely option. To stick with Boeing, Ryanair's current fleet provider, would lower 
maintenance costs, if its executives' bruised feelings could be smoothed over. But investors need not fret. Any new 
orders are at least a couple of years away. Hopes of a 2012 special dividend - a repeat of Ryanair's first-ever pay-
out last year - and maybe another one in 2014, seem realistic.

Alan Joyce was the dark horse candidate when he was picked for Qantas's chief executive in 2008 and defeated 
John Borghetti, a life-long Qantas employee and once one of the favourites for the top job.
Mr Borghetti now leads  rival Virgin Australia, and is losing no time trying to take advantage of his former employer's 
troubles to snap up disaffected customers.
Mr Joyce's decision to ground the fleet last weekend forced the government to intervene and help end its long-
running dispute with unions angry over plans to cut jobs and base others outside of Australia.
The tactic worked as strikes are suspended while management and unions negotiate a settlement, expected to be 
sealed towards the end of this year or early next, but the backlash continues.
Certain segments of Australia media have been describing Mr Joyce, a naturalised Australian citizen, as "the 
diminutive Irishman" - a jab at the foreignness of the man seen as trying to weaken Australian unions and base 
more jobs offshore.
Mr Joyce spent Friday morning testifying before a parliamentary inquiry against legislation that could force Qantas 
to base all its subsidiaries at home and pay overseas staff at Australian rates.
Also pressing the company is competition posed by Virgin Australia and, to a lesser extent, the local subsidiary of 
Singapore's Tiger Airways.
Virgin edges in after Qantas troubles
Under Mr Borghetti, Virgin has been striking alliances with international carriers, such as Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, 
to improve its network.
Domestically, Qantas dominates the corporate travel market, but Mr Borghetti is trying to double Virgin's share of 
that market to 20 per cent. Because of the additional demand generated by Qantas's slowdown, Virgin will be able 
to meet that goal earlier than expected, Mr Borghetti has said.
Last week, Virgin began selling tickets earlier than planned for seats in its new business class between Sydney, 
Melbourne and Brisbane.
"[The grounding] gave us an opportunity to show how good we are and how much of a really good alternative we 
are in this country," Mr Borghetti said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.
Qantas's overall domestic market share is 65 per cent, but it has nearly 90 per cent of the lucrative corporate 
traveller market. That domestic base is particularly important as its share of international travel is falling. It had just 
18.4 per cent of international passengers this July, down from 19.3 per cent a year earlier, according to a report 
from RBS.
When Mr Joyce emerged as the unexpected winner of the 2008 race to become Qantas's chief executive, Mr 
Borghetti had been the airline's general manager. Mr Joyce was the head of Jetstar, the low-cost subsidiary that 
resembled Ireland's no-frills Ryanair more than the major flag carrier he was about to take over.
"He's an operations researcher, basically. His background is mathematics, and a lot of what Jetstar built on was a 
very clever system of setting prices and scheduling," says Russell Lansbury, a business professor at the University 
of Sydney.
Staff at Jetstar, Qantas's "small sister", have some union representation, but Mr Joyce was seen as a tough 
negotiator, and the employees there had less generous contracts than Qantas employees, says Greg Bamber, an 
academic at Monash University who has studied the company's industrial relations.
"He was taking a hard line on labour when he was chief executive of Jetstar, so to some extent this is a 
continuation of how he was seen," said Mr Bamber.
Mr Joyce's success building up the Jetstar subsidiary enabled Qantas to use its primary fleet to offer business 
travellers better service than Virgin, while its Jetstar brand challenged Virgin Australia for the tourist market.
The frequent reference to Mr Joyce's Irish heritage is at least partially apt, says Siobhán Creaton, an Irish journalist 
and author of a history of Ryanair. Mr Joyce started his career at Aer Lingus, which in the 1990s was one of the first 
airlines forced to learn how to cut costs to compete with Ryanair.
That competition spawned a generation of Irish airline executives, including British Airlines' head Willie Walsh, 
known for their attention to costs and their willingness to be tough with unions to achieve those goals, said Ms 
Creaton.
Virgin's move to compete with Qantas for business travel could be risky, said Cameron McDonald, an analyst with 
Deutsche Bank. Qantas under Mr Joyce looks to cut costs to improve overall profits, and Virgin is now competing 
for Qantas's business customers on price. That, says another analyst, could depress Virgin's earnings even if it 
does win market share.
Nonetheless, Qantas' problems have given Mr Borghetti an opening for now.
"We haven't changed our strategy nor our objective, but it is accelerating," said Mr Borghetti.

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, has a big decision to make.
After a decade of ferocious growth at the low-cost airline, Ryanair's fleet will peak at 300 next year when Boeing 
supplies the last aircraft due under a 2005 contract with the US manufacturer.
The question for Mr O'Leary is what to do next - expand Ryanair once again by purchasing more aircraft, or 
concentrate on generating cash and handing it back to shareholders. A second issue hanging over Ryanair is 
whether it can realistically retain its ultra-lean cost structure over the long term.
Mr O'Leary - a self-confessed "loud mouth" - is clear about the case for buying new aircraft: "Staying as is for the 
next 10 to 20 years sounds a bit too much like just lethargy ... we're not going to stop here," he says.
Ryanair is therefore in "talks" with three manufacturers - Boeing of the US, China's Comac and Russia's Irkut - 
about the possibility of buying between 200 and 300 narrow-body aircraft from one of them. Mr O'Leary has a tough 
reputation when it comes to negotiations. In 2002, he infuriated Airbus by signing a contract with Boeing for its 737-
800 aircraft after coming close to a deal with the European manufacturer. Relations between Ryanair and Airbus 
have never fully recovered.
He likes to highlight the discount he secured on that 2002 order, given that it was struck during the aviation industry 
crisis that followed the September 11 terror attacks, when aircraft makers were desperate for deals.
Mr O'Leary thinks he can get a good deal this time around because the manufacturers could once again have 
orders cancelled amid the worsening economic climate.
Ryanair reviews supply options
Boeing and Airbus are also facing new competitors. To try to heap pressure on the established jet makers, Mr 
O'Leary says he is in serious negotiations with Comac and Irkut, which are both proposing to supply airlines with 
narrow-body aircraft from 2016.
However, Nick Cunningham, analyst at Agency Partners, says Boeing and Airbus have little incentive to strike a 
cut-price deal with Ryanair for new aircraft because they already have substantial orders for their narrow-body jets.
He adds that Ryanair could opt for the unknown quantity of buying aircraft from the Chinese or Russians, but those 
aircraft could well encounter significant delays in development. Meanwhile, although Ryanair may look a better 
investment than the European flag carriers in a weak economic situation, because more people want cheap air 
travel, some analysts say the company's profit margin could come under pressure.
Ryanair recorded a 13.5 per cent operating margin in 2010-11, compared with 4.5 per cent at Lufthansa in 2010, 
and 3.9 per cent at British Airways in the six months to June 30.
Geoff van Klaveren, analyst at Deutsche Bank, says that more expansion by Ryanair could reduce its profitability 
because opening new European short-haul routes often involves discounted fares.
He adds that Ryanair investors will want reassurances that renewed expansion is not accompanied by weaker 
operating margins.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at RBS, highlights other long term risks for Ryanair, including the possibility of higher 
airport user charges and unionisation of the company's workforce.
Mr O'Leary has no issue with employees joining trade unions, but says collective bargaining could mean pay cuts. 
And he insists he can extract favourable user charges with airports that are keen to secure more travellers, 
particularly in uncertain economic times.
The Ryanair chief executive's energy is undiminished after 17 years in the top job.
Mr O'Leary says he will retire in two to three years, but acknowledges he has been saying that for a long time.

Ryanair has ambitious plans to increase the number of passengers flying with Europe's leading low-cost airline 
each year from 70m to up to 130m over the next decade, by buying as many as 300 aircraft.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, told the Financial Times he was looking to take a large delivery of 
aircraft between 2015 and 2021, and was in talks with US, Chinese and Russian manufacturers.
His comments are his most explicit yet about taking the Irish airline on a second phase of growth following rapid 
expansion over the past decade.
Mr O'Leary insisted he would only buy aircraft at "cheap prices", but one analyst questioned whether Ryanair could 
strike a cut-price deal with Boeing or Airbus, the established commercial aircraft makers. Another analyst said 
further expansion could hurt profitability at the airline.
Ryanair has an all-Boeing fleet, and Mr O'Leary acknowledged it faced increased operating costs if it bought aircraft 
from a different manufacturer.
Ryanair is talking to three manufacturers - Boeing of the US, China's Comac and Russia's Irkut - about a deal to 
buy 200-300 narrow-body aircraft from one of them.
Such a deal would enlarge Ryanair's fleet from 300 to 500 - some new jets would replace older ones - and enable 
the airline to increase passenger numbers. "I would like to grow to 120m, 130m passengers," said Mr O'Leary. In 
2010-11, 72.1m passengers flew with Ryanair.
Ryanair eyes fresh phase of growth
At 130m passengers, Ryanair would consolidate its position as one of the world's largest airlines. Lufthansa, 
Europe's largest airline by revenue, flew 91m passengers in 2010. Southwest Airlines, the US low-cost carrier, flew 
88m passengers in 2010.
Mr O'Leary said demand for low-cost air travel in the deteriorating economic environment meant Ryanair could 
continue to increase market share on European short-haul routes at the expense of flag carriers including Lufthansa 
and British Airways.
Ryanair's expansion in recent years has focused on Italy and Spain, and Mr O'Leary said the airline now had big 
growth opportunities in Scandinavia and eastern Europe.
He outlined the case for deploying 50 aircraft in Scandinavia and 100 in eastern Europe.
Mr O'Leary added that Ryanair could pay two more special dividends before it placed a new aircraft order.
Ryanair paid a maiden dividend worth EUR500m last year, and is considering a similar payment to shareholders in 
2012-13.
Mr O'Leary said a third special dividend might possible in 2014-15 if Ryanair had not finalised an aircraft order by 
then, but he ruled out the company making an annual pay-out to shareholders.

Etihad, the fast-growing Middle Eastern airline, has approached the Irish government to buy its 25 per cent stake in 
flag-carrier Aer Lingus, people with knowledge of the move said.
The approach comes after the debt-laden Irish sovereign said in September it would sell its stake in the national 
carrier. Leo Varadkar, Ireland's transport minister, said that he would not sell it for less than EUR1 per share, which 
would value the stake at EUR132.4m ($183m) and the airline at EUR529.6m.
Aer Lingus shares closed at EUR0.64 on Friday, valuing the airline at EUR338.94m and the government stake at 
EUR84.7m.
It is unclear how far talks have progressed and they might not result in any deal. Etihad and the Irish government 
declined to comment. Analysts believe that the most likely buyer of the airline is International Airlines Group, the 
parent company of British Airways.
Last week James Hogan, Etihad chief executive, met Enda Kenny, Irish prime minister, at an investment event in 
Dublin, the global Irish Economic Forum. Mr Hogan announced 100 new jobs for cabin crew based in Ireland.
Etihad has been in talks with Virgin Atlantic  on a possible partnership should the UK carrier bid for BMI, the 
lossmaking subsidiary of Lufthansa, say people familiar with the talks.
IAG, the holding company of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, has tabled a preliminary offer for BMI, which holds 
valuable take-off and landing slots at Heathrow airport.
Etihad in talks to buy Aer Lingus stake
Etihad is interested in the possibility of tapping BMI's short and medium-haul network for its own long-haul routes.
An Irish government report in June recommended selling the national airline along with ports and power stations as 
part of plans to raise EUR5bn to repair Ireland's accounts. One potential stumbling block to the sale of the Aer 
Lingus stake is the large deficit in a pension scheme of which the company is a sponsoring employer. The deficit 
was estimated to be EUR400m last year, and a new actuarial valuation is due by December.
Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus chief executive, has said he welcomed a possible ownership change at the company.
Ryanair ruled itself out of a bid, having failed twice to take it over because of objections by the Irish government and 
European competition authorities.

Aer Lingus has asked shareholders to approve technical adjustments to its balance sheet that would enable it to 
pay special dividends in the future.
The Irish airline has not made any dividend payments to shareholders since it was floated in 2006. In recent months 
Ryanair, which holds a 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, has repeatedly called on the company's board to return 
cash to shareholders. Aer Lingus management has so far rejected the calls, citing the current unstable economic 
conditions.
Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington wrote to shareholders on Wednesday requesting that they sanction the 
cancellation of up to EUR500m in non-distributable reserves, freeing up the cash to potentially pay a dividend in the 
future. The company has called an extraordinary meeting on November 4 to approve the changes.
Under Irish company law any dividends on ordinary shares must be funded from distributable reserves, regardless 
of whether the company has enough cash to pay them. This has limited Aer Lingus's ability to pay dividends due to 
the EUR210m of accumulated losses on its balance sheet built up during past periods of sustained losses.
Mr Barrington's letter to shareholders said the company was not contemplating the immediate payment of a 
dividend but wanted to increase flexibility for the future. At the end of June Aer Lingus had EUR357m net cash on 
its balance sheet.
"The board is not currently contemplating the payment of a dividend to shareholders (or the redemption or 
repurchase of ordinary shares) and the board believes that it is in the best interests of the company and 
Aer Lingus acts to allow special dividends
shareholders as a whole to consider a dividend when there is a more durable recovery and consequent earnings 
visibility," said Mr Barrington.
Joe Gill, analyst with Dublin-based Bloxham stockbrokers, told the Financial Times that Aer Lingus shareholders, 
which include Ryanair and the Irish government, would likely support the changes and forecast that a dividend 
could be paid in the future.
"Aer Lingus is well capable of paying a dividend. A special dividend in Aer Lingus may also be an alternative 
method for the government to extract some value from the company without selling its 25 per cent stake," he said.
Royal Bank of Scotland said in a research note said the proposal by Aer Lingus was a "modest positive" for Ryanair 
in terms of both the potential cash flows from its shareholding in Aer Lingus and the way it would potentially make 
the stake more attractive to a potential buyer.
Ryanair responded to the Aer Lingus statement by publishing an open letter to Mr Barrington urging him to reply to 
a September 28 message in which the carrier outlined its proposals to reverse the collapse of the company's share 
price. Ryanair asked Aer Lingus to consider a EUR110m special dividend.

After all the discussion of Ryanair's new branded credit card, which lets people skirt a £6 administration charge per 
ticket but carries a number of its own costs, the official launch in London on Tuesday morning seemed somehow 
belated.
Nor did it introduce any new information to the debate over the Cash Passport card, which costs £6 to sign on for 
(though you get a £6 Ryanair voucher in exchange) and must be used at least once every half-year to avoid 
charges.
Michael O'Leary, the low-cost carrier's fiery chief executive, lunged and pointed at screen-shots of Ryanair's 
website to refute the notion that those charges were hidden - a detail that had prompted Which? magazine to call 
the card an insult to customers. "It's not in my nature to insult a customer on Ryanair," said Mr O'Leary, tongue 
embedded in cheek.
He listed the ways to avoid check-in charges, advanced-boarding charges, charges for flying with a baby. "The 
infanf fee is avoidable by not having infants, which as a father of four relatively small children, I would highly 
recommend."
Incidentally, he added, "we'd like to thank everyone, particularly in the media, for all the promotion", noting that 
10,000 people had applied for cards in the past two weeks, snapping up a third of the first print run.
That is in spite of concerns over payment protection - another worry Mr O'Leary dismissed amid his attempt to "re-
educate" people about the card - and an ongoing investigation by the Office of Fair Trading into airlines' surcharges 
Ryanair 's cash passport card goes ahead
for card payments. Whatever the OFT's conclusion, said Mr O'Leary on Tuesday, it wouldn't prompt him to change 
one detail of the Cash Passport, although advertising might have to be tweaked.
He did say, however, that if the company didn't hit its target of half all Ryanair flights being booked through either 
the credit card or pre-paid Mastercard in 12 months' time, he might reconsider the terms and conditions. Or as he 
put it, "I'll flail myself publicly in Trafalgar Square."
Even the 50 per cent mark is a modest ambition: following Ryanair's introduction of checked-baggage charges, the 
number of customers checking luggage fell from 80 per cent to just one in four.
In response to questions about the 5.75 per cent commission Cash Passport users would be charged for purchases 
in foreign currencies - significantly higher than the average - Mr O'Leary said people could always use other cards. 
"We're not a foreign exchange business."

Ever since the coalition government ruled out allowing new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted airports, 
ministers have been accused by the aviation industry of lacking a credible policy to deal with rising long-term 
demand for air travel.
In theory, the ambitious proposal to integrate Heathrow and Gatwick through a high-speed rail link could form the 
solution, but the industry has quickly denounced the idea.
Ministers have been told by business that a new aviation policy was badly needed as part of efforts to kick-start the 
flagging economy. A report published last month said the UK was at serious risk of missing out on trade with 
emerging markets worth £14bn during the next decade because Heathrow was operating at full capacity and could 
not expand.
These findings about the capacity crunch in the south-east explain why ministers are coming under pressure to 
speed up their policymaking. They previously promised an aviation framework by 2013.
Ministers may now be focusing their minds, but on Friday airlines and airport operators lined up to express grave 
misgivings about the interest in creating a "virtual hub" between Heathrow and Gatwick.
British Airways said linking Heathrow and Gatwick "does absolutely nothing to address the ever more pressing 
issue of the south-east's need to have more airport capacity in order for the UK to remain globally competitive".
Airlines denounce airports' 'virtual hub'
BAA, Heathrow's owner, said the idea "faces insurmountable technical, operational, political and financial 
challenges, and would take many years to deliver". A rail industry executive, who declined to be named, said it 
would be difficult to build a high-speed network between Heathrow and Gatwick.
The government is holding to its view that it will not allow the construction of more runways at Heathrow, Gatwick or 
Stansted.
However, ministers think additional airport capacity may be found by linking Heathrow and Gatwick. Following the 
construction of a high-speed rail link between the two airports, the idea would be for Gatwick to focus on short and 
medium haul flights to and from Europe.
Some of these Gatwick flights could then provide important feeder traffic to Heathrow, which would focus on long-
haul flights.
Gatwick has some room to accommodate extra flights because it is operating at 80 per cent capacity. In theory, 
more capacity could be found if Ryanair and EasyJet, the low-cost airlines, ended their operations at Gatwick and 
concentrated on Stansted and other airports, such as Luton.
Ryanair and EasyJet might choose to sell their take off and landing slots at Gatwick if they increased in value 
because of a high-speed rail link with Heathrow.
But Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said there was "no way of moving the budget airlines out of 
Gatwick". He added: "There won't be a high-speed rail link between Heathrow and Gatwick in my lifetime. The cost 
of it would be prohibitive."
EasyJet, which dismissed the idea of linking Heathrow and Gatwick, said: "EasyJet will fight any attempt to force us 
out of Gatwick all the way."

The Competition Commission has ordered BAA to begin the process of selling one of its Scottish airports, bringing 
forward a divestment first ordered two and a half years ago.
Disposal of either Glasgow or Edinburgh will now precede any sale of Stansted, changing the schedule the 
commission laid out in its 2009 report which found the airport operator dominated markets in Scotland and the 
south-east of England.
BAA's holdings at the time included Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh airports, 
although it was already in the process of selling Gatwick.
The commission ordered BAA, owned by Spain's Ferrovial, to complete that sale, then proceed to selling Stansted 
before disposing of either Edinburgh or Glasgow. But the process has been delayed by a raft of appeals - most 
recently BAA's request for a judicial review of the ruling to sell Stansted.
"It is clearer now than it has ever been that Heathrow and Stansted serve different markets," said Colin Matthews, 
BAA's chief executive, on Friday. "We are pleased that the Competition Commission has accepted BAA's proposal 
to reverse the order of airport sales."
Earlier on Friday, Ryanair condemned what it called delaying tactics by BAA and the raising of fees at Stansted,    
which it said had suffered five years of traffic declines.
Order of BAA sell-offs reversed
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said: "Any other company faced with a 27 per cent drop in passenger 
numbers would respond by cutting its prices. BAA's response has been to more than double landing charges at 
Stansted."

A radical plan for a new "Heath-Wick" airport hub featuring a £5bn high-speed rail link between Heathrow and 
Gatwick is being considered seriously by ministers, the Financial Times has learnt.
The idea was put forward as an alternative to the politically unpalatable expansion of Heathrow and is being closely 
examined by ministers, who are under pressure to increase airport capacity in the south-east of England.
The British Chambers of Commerce suggested two years ago that high-speed rail could be used to link Heathrow 
and Gatwick, creating a "collective hub". Councillor Victoria Borwick, a member of the Greater London Authority's 
transport committee and former Conservative party treasurer, will on Saturday call for a more detailed consultation 
into the idea.
She believes her proposal will expand capacity around London without jeopardising the coalition's promise not to 
build new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted.
Stansted, in Essex, is relatively unpopular with airways and is only running at 58 per cent capacity.
Building a 15-minute link between Heathrow and Gatwick could increase the price of landing slots at the latter, and 
eventually force low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet to move to Stansted. This could free up more slots 
at the new "Heath-Wick" hub for an expansion of regional capacity, an idea which has caught the eye of cabinet 
ministers.
The Department for Transport said a draft aviation policy would be published for consultation in the spring.
Heath-Wick airport hub assessed
"We are seeking views on the key issues which need to be addressed, including the importance of a UK hub airport 
and whether it might be possible to create a 'virtual hub' by improving connectivity between existing airports," it 
said. "This proposal will form a useful contribution to the debate."
The 35-mile high-speed rail route would see trains travelling at up to 180mph parallel to the M25, before 
disappearing into tunnels en route to Gatwick. Passengers would not need to pass through immigration or check-in 
twice.
The route would take several years to legislate and another five to build. As such it would be faster to build than 
alternatives including the £40bn "Boris Airport" proposed by London's mayor, Boris Johnson, for the Thames 
estuary.
"We have all heard of ideas floating around such as Boris Airport, Cliffe Airport or RAF Manston but most are 25 
years off," said Cllr Borwick. "We need to look at what we can do in a reasonable time frame and to a reasonable 
budget."
Mr Johnson this week rowed back from his once-cherished plan, suggesting he was now "not wedded to any 
particular solution". "It may be that there are alternative ideas that people provide," he said. "High-speed links 
between this or that airport ... creating a dual hub or whatever."
Airlines including British Airways are likely to reject the plan and call again for a third runway at Heathrow. But the 
government believes a U-turn over Heathrow is politically impossible.
David Begg, chair of the Business Infrastructure Commission and a non-executive director at BAA, said Heathrow's 
third runway was still the best "shovel-ready" option: "You could do it quickly but the problem is that politically that 
option is just toxic and off-limits just now. That is why it makes sense to look at a number of options such as this 
one."

Iberia on Thursday announced plans to create a low-cost airline called Iberia Express, as part of efforts to improve 
the Spanish flag carrier's profitability.
International Airlines Group, the company created through the merger of Iberia and British Airways, hopes the low-
cost carrier will provide stronger competition on short and medium-haul routes for budget airlines led by Ryanair 
and EasyJet.
However, Sepla, the Spanish pilots' union, said the plans for Iberia Express broke agreements signed with Iberia 
during its merger with British Airways.
"The creation of the new company is illegal, violating the agreements signed with Iberia in connection with the 
merger," said Sepla, which is considering strike action over the plans.
It means Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, could get embroiled in another episode of industrial unrest. Last year, 
cabin crew at BA went on strike over plans to reduce staff on long-haul flights, and the bitter dispute was only 
resolved in June.
Iberia Express will start operations with four aircraft next summer from Madrid airport, but it should have 13 jets by 
the end of 2012.
"Iberia Express will have lower operating costs than Iberia's lossmaking short and medium-haul business," said 
IAG. "The subsidiary will recruit new staff at market rates."
Iberia to launch low-cost airline
The pressure from Ryanair and EasyJet has weighed on Iberia's results, and it reported a EUR78m ($105m) 
operating loss for the six months to June 30. BA reported a EUR210m operating profit in the first half of 2011.
Rafael Sánchez-Lozano, Iberia's chief executive, said no one at the flag carrier would lose their job following the 
creation of Iberia Express. It will not operate all of Iberia's short and medium-haul operations from next year, but the 
number of routes provided by the new airline is likely to increase over time. Iberia has 68 aircraft on short and 
medium-haul routes.
Geoff van Klaveren, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said European flag carriers needed to maintain their lossmaking 
short-haul operations to provide feeder traffic for their profitable long-haul business.
He added that it was clear Iberia would rapidly transfer routes to Iberia Express. "We therefore see a distinct 
possibility of a strike by pilots and cabin crew at Iberia, but we believe the longer-term benefits to shareholders 
significantly outweigh the short-term cost of any strike action," said Mr van Klaveren.

Two European airlines on Wednesday added to the gloom about the industry's near-term prospects, with 
International Airlines Group highlighting reduced demand for business travel and Flybe issuing a profit warning.
IAG, Europe's third-largest airline by revenue and owner of British Airways and Iberia, said that "indications so far 
for October point to a softer demand picture" in premium passenger traffic and air cargo.
Shares in Flybe, Europe's largest regional airline by routes, closed down 36 per cent at 65p after it guided the 
market towards lower full-year profit due to reduced demand for UK domestic flights.
Amid the deteriorating economic environment, Lufthansa, Europe's largest airline by revenue, last month issued a 
profit warning after disappointing sales in August and lower-than-expected flight bookings for September and 
October.
However, while IAG signalled it was prepared to cut seating capacity in response to reduced demand, the airline 
said it was on course "to produce significant growth in operating profit in 2011" compared with last year.
IAG's shares closed up 4.5 per cent at 156p.
Geoff van Klaveren, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said IAG's passenger traffic data for September were stronger than 
he expected.
IAG and Flybe add to gloom over airlines
"It's encouraging that corporate travel seems to be holding up," said Mr Klaveren, referring to IAG's 9.3 per cent 
increase in premium traffic in September compared with the same time last year. "This data would suggest IAG is 
outperforming its peers."
Business travellers are European flag carriers' most valuable customers, generating about 50 per cent of their 
revenues.
IAG's figures alluded to the contrasting performances of its two operating companies. BA, which reported a 
EUR210m ($279.9m) operating profit in the six months to June 30, recorded passenger traffic growth of 6 per cent 
in September compared with the same time last year. Iberia, which reported an operating loss of EUR78m for the 
half-year, recorded traffic growth of 0.8 per cent in September.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline by revenue, underlined its resilience in the weakening economic 
environment by outlining passenger traffic growth of 6 per cent in September.
Meanwhile, Flybe said revenue for the six months to September 30 was 1 per cent below management's 
expectations, with costs staying in line with forecasts.
Most of the revenue shortfall appeared to have come from September trading, when the airline "noted a significant 
slowdown in sales across our domestic network". It also said ticket revenue since September 30 was up 1 per cent 
compared with the same time last year, lagging expectations.
Analysts said the sell-off did not seem an over-reaction given the high operational gearing of Flybe, where a 
revenue shortfall of 1 per cent can take 30 per cent off pre-tax profit.
Douglas McNeill, analyst at Charles Stanley, said: "Flybe's challenge has been to show profits commensurate with 
the strength of the brand. But Britain's feeble economy is conspiring to prevent that."
The aviation industry is facing regulatory as well as economic challenges. Today, an advocate general to the 
European Court of Justice will give an opinion on whether non-European airlines should have to comply with the 
European Union's carbon emissions trading scheme.

It's gratifying when private corporate disagreements erupt into the open. It confirms the perception that business, 
often dressed up as a decorous diplomatic dance, is in fact a vicious hand-to-hand battle. It was in this spirit that I 
welcomed the recent outbreak of hostilities between Oracle - the software group headed by Larry Ellison - and 
Autonomy, the UK technology company founded by Mike Lynch and now being taken over by Hewlett-Packard.
To recap: Mr Ellison alleged on a conference call that Autonomy had first been "shopped" to Oracle but the price 
had been "absurdly high". Mr Lynch riposted that Mr Ellison's remarks were "inaccurate" and his understanding of 
Autonomy's business weak. Oracle retorted that "either Mr Lynch has a very poor memory or he's lying" about an 
April meeting with Oracle executives. The two sides finally fought themselves to a standstill, leaving the impression 
that the company was shopped to Oracle - but earlier and by a banker acting independently (out of the goodness of 
his heart, as bankers do). Move along now, nothing to see here.
US technology companies are notorious for this rough-and-tumble public rivalry. Sometimes this criticism is direct, 
such as Mr Ellison's jibes against rivals including HP, Microsoft and SAP. Sometimes it is more subtle, like Jeff 
Bezos's sideways criticism of the price and performance deficiencies of Apple's iPad at last week's launch of 
Amazon's Kindle tablet.
Michael O'Leary, mouthy boss of Ryanair, the budget airline, has virtually built the company's identity on public 
attacks against rivals - from EasyJet to British Airways to Aer Lingus. In the same sector, Virgin Atlantic's Sir 
Richard Branson fuelled his airline's challenge to BA in the 1980s and early 1990s with some brutal public sparring.
In long-running disputes, at least one of the antagonists is usually an entrepreneur or owner with the authority and 
personality to throw punches publicly. There are exceptions, such as the dull and interminable tug-of-war between 
The trick is to know when to shut up
Boeing and Airbus over which has sold most aircraft. But faceless companies generally foster rivalry in private. It is 
as hard to imagine Unilever's chief executive publicly accusing his Nestlé counterpart of being an amnesiac or a liar 
as it is to imagine Mr Ellison trading his superyacht for a pair of comfortable slippers and a pipe.
Rivalry is a double-edged management tool, however. A recent study analysed US college basketball and found 
that players tried harder against traditional rivals. Co-author Gavin Kilduff of New York University's Stern School of 
Business told me that publicity for the game could further stoke up the antagonism. But the study also warns that 
intense corporate rivalry, as distinct from mere competition, "opens up the possibility of economically irrational 
behaviour" including "an unwillingness to co-operate with rivals even when it is instrumentally beneficial".
This can get personal. Speaking at a private lunch last week, the grizzled chairman of a large listed UK group 
recalled how an executive at a multinational brusquely declined to sell to him early in his career. Promoted decades 
later to run a big client of this multinational, he took great pleasure telling the same executive how he would never 
buy from him or his company, even if he gave away its product. Satisfying, no doubt, but hardly good business.
Extreme rivalry can lead to unethical behaviour - like the so-called "dirty tricks" campaign BA ran against Virgin. A 
follow-up paper by Prof Kilduff and others looks at Italian soccer derbies: it finds that when arch-rivals meet, players 
are more likely to commit serious fouls.
So, managers (on and off the sports pitch) must be careful not to encourage the wrong sort of rivalry - and they 
need to pick their moment to take such spats public.
Unlike Mr Ellison, very much in charge of his company, Mr Lynch has just agreed the sale of his - to HP, which was 
probably the real target of Mr Ellison's initial jab. Mr Lynch should have welcomed the fact that his company had 
discomfited Oracle enough to earn a mention and left it at that. If I were an Autonomy employee at this time of 
takeover uncertainty, I would not be fired up by Mr Lynch's counter-attack against Mr Ellison; I'd be worried the boss 
had got us into a brawl with one of the biggest boys on the technology block.

The board of Iberia is set to meet this week to consider establishing a new low-cost airline that should help improve 
the Spanish flag carrier's profitability, but could also provoke industrial action.
Iberia, owned by International Airlines Group, has for the past two years been studying the case for creating a low-
cost airline that would assume responsibility for Spanish flag carrier's short-haul flights.
Sepla, the Spanish pilots union, said it believed Iberia was considering outsourcing many functions related to its 
domestic flights and warned it could consider the case for strike action.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, could therefore be dealing with a second significant bout of industrial action. 
Cabin crew at British Airways, also owned by IAG, went on strike last year after the company proposed cutting 
staffing on long-haul flights and the bitter dispute was only resolved in June.
Iberia is contending with intense competition from Ryanair and EasyJet, Europe's leading low-cost airlines, on short 
and medium-haul flights, and it is one factor weighing on the Spanish flag carrier's performance.
Iberia reported an operating loss of EUR78m in the six months to June 30, while BA recorded a profit of EUR210m.
The board of Iberia is due to meet on Tuesday, although the airline declined to comment. IAG also declined to 
comment.
The low-cost airline that Iberia has been considering would provide feeder traffic for the Spanish flag carrier's long-
haul flights.
Iberia board eyes options for new airline
Joe Gill, analyst at Bloxham, said Iberia's short-haul restructuring might also involve Vueling, the low-cost airline in 
which the Spanish flag carrier has a 46 per cent stake.
Vueling has been operating a limited number of domestic and European flights on behalf of Iberia this year.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, said IAG and Iberia were keen to push ahead with the 
restructuring of the Spanish flag carrier's short and medium-haul operations.
"We expected this plan to prompt industrial action and we have only been surprised that the process has taken so 
long," he added.
Iberia has experience of running a low-cost airline. It set up Clickair in 2006, but it ran up losses and was merged 
with Vueling in 2009. Vueling reported revenue of EUR230m for the three months to June 30, and operating profit of 
EUR4m.

The chief executive of Aer Lingus has expressed strong misgivings about another airline securing control of the 
Irish flag-carrier.
Christoph Mueller, the airline's chief executive, said he welcomed a possible ownership change at the company, but 
said he would prefer institutional investors to buy stakes held by the Dublin government and Ryanair.
He claimed Aer Lingus' marketing partnerships with other airlines could be jeopardised if it was bought by another 
carrier.
The Irish government announced this month that it was considering selling its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus. 
Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, responded by saying it could sell its 29.8 per cent stake in the airline.
Ryanair has failed with two attempted takeovers of Aer Lingus since the company's flotation in 2006, because of 
objections by the Dublin government and European competition authorities. Analysts suggested the most likely 
buyer of the Irish flag-carrier was International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways and Iberia.
Mr Mueller said the Irish government and Ryanair could sell their stakes to institutional investors.
"There is enough demand in the market to place the shares," he told the Financial Times. "The government and 
Ryanair - either jointly or separately - would mandate a bank to place their shares in the market."
Mr Mueller insisted he had an open mind on Aer Lingus' future ownership, but said he would like the majority of its 
shares to be listed on the Dublin stock exchange.
Aer Lingus wary over takeover by airline
He also said one or more of Aer Lingus' existing partnerships - code-sharing agreements with British Airways, KLM 
and United Airlines - could be cancelled if it was bought by another airline.
"That would have negative effects on our bottom line," added Mr Mueller. "You cannot act as an independent airline 
once you have a majority shareholder that is another larger airline."
One potential stumbling block to the Dublin government and Ryanair selling their stakes in Aer Lingus is the large 
deficit in a pension scheme of which the company is a sponsoring employer.
The deficit was estimated to be EUR400m ($538m) last year, and a new actuarial valuation is due by December.
The pension scheme's trustees are then expected to decide how to try to fix the deficit, with the possibility that 
members' benefits might have to be cut if the sponsoring employers do not increase their contributions.
Mr Mueller said Aer Lingus could not increase its contributions without prior approval by shareholders.
He added shareholders might have to weigh the case for increased contributions by the company to the scheme 
against the risk that any reduction in members' benefits could prompt industrial action at Aer Lingus.

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of EasyJet, will find it hard to repeat his feat of creating one of Europe's leading 
airlines, Ryanair said on Thursday.
EasyJet surprised the aviation industry on Monday by saying that Sir Stelios had told the company that he intended 
setting up a new airline called Fastjet. A website with the address fastjet.com has already been established.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, told the company's annual meeting in Dublin that Sir Stelios would find it 
tougher this time compared to when he set up EasyJet.
"If he were to set up an airline in Europe this time around it would be much more difficult now because Ryanair is 
much larger than when he set up EasyJet and EasyJet is much larger," Mr O'Leary said. "All he has done so far is 
set up one page on the internet. I wouldn't hold my breath."
Mr O'Leary became chief executive of Ryanair in 1994, one year before Sir Stelios set up EasyJet. The two 
companies became close rivals, both pursuing the same low-cost business model and offering cheap flights 
between European destinations.
Ryanair is today Europe's largest low-cost airline by revenue, followed by EasyJet.
Sir Stelios stepped down as EasyJet's chairman in 2002, but his family is the company's largest shareholder, with a 
38 per cent stake. He has been locked in an acrimonious dispute with EasyJet over strategy for the past three 
years, calling for the company to pay dividends and curb its fleet expansion.
EasyJet founder's plan questioned
This month, EasyJet said it would pay its first ever dividends next year, worth £190m, and shortly afterwards Sir 
Stelios dropped his latest attempt to shake the board by removing a director.
However, he shocked EasyJet on Saturday by sending an email to Sir Michael Rake, the chairman, saying he 
intended to set up a new airline. Sir Stelios has declined to provide further details, and did not comment on Mr 
O'Leary's comments.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at RBS, EasyJet's broker, said it would be difficult for a new venture by Sir Stelios to 
succeed compared with 10 years ago, when low-cost airlines had the opportunity to grab market share from flag 
carriers on short-haul routes.
"EasyJet, and indeed Ryanair have major strategic advantages over other low-cost airlines, including very cheap 
aircraft [and] widely known pan-European brands," he added.

Bid speculation returned to London's equity market on Thursday after Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, 
said British Airways would be the most likely buyer of a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.
The Irish government is considering putting its quarter holding in the national airline up for sale, and although Mr 
O'Leary did not rule out Ryanair buying the stake, he said "the obvious trade buyer would be IAG", the company 
formed last year by the merger of BA and Spain's Iberia. Ryanair already owns 29 per cent of Aer Lingus and would 
consider selling the stake, O'Leary added.
Shares in IAG climbed 3.8 per cent to 159.7p, while the London-listed shares of Ryanair added 0.5 per cent.
Tate & Lyle climbed after it became the latest index constituent to issue upbeat guidance for the rest of the year.
The sweetener and starch maker said solid demand during the summer, which was unusually strong in the US, 
meant it expected "another year of profitable growth". Shares in the company were 2.9 per cent higher at 630p, the 
biggest gain on the top tier of the market by a clear margin.
"Tate's second-quarter update ... reads as upbeat to us," said Martin Deboo, analyst at Investec. "Tate is continuing 
to sail in calm and sunny waters. But so is the share price and valuation. The shares have outperformed the FTSE 
100 by 6 per cent in the most recent month."
Overall, London's benchmark index ended 0.4 per cent lower at 5,196.84 after a volatile session. Investors 
welcomed an upward revision to US second-quarter growth, and also the passage of measures to increase the size 
of the eurozone's bail-out fund through the German parliament.
Bid interest returns to FTSE
Enis Mehmet, Analyst at Autochartist, said the FTSE 100 was trading around significant levels that could define its 
near-term future. "Based on the short-term range of 4,928.10 from the bottom on September 23 to the September 
28 top at 5,304.46, traders should look for a near-term break to [between] 5,071.87 and 5,116.29. A test of this 
zone is likely to decide the fate of the market."
With a sense of caution still evident in dealing rooms, riskier mining stocks remained under pressure. Antofagasta 
fell the furthest among base metal miners, down 3.2 per cent at 959p.
Shares in Icap, the world's largest interdealer broker by market capitalisation, fell 0.6 per cent to 427p after it said it 
expected interim revenue to rise only "marginally", despite the market volatility from which the company usually 
benefits. It stood by its existing guidance for the full year.
Lower down the market, signs that Thomas Cook was moving to address its strained debt burden were well-
received, even as they came at the expense of its dividend payments.
The tour operator said it was concentrating on "improving its financial flexibility" ahead of a test of its banking 
covenants due in December, and that it would be conserving capital to pay down debt by not issuing a dividend. 
Shares in Thomas Cook have lost almost 80 per cent of their value over the past 12 months after it issued a string 
of profit warnings, but Thursday's news helped the shares 5.7 per cent higher to 39p.
London's mid-cap index fell 0.5 per cent overall to 9,985.45.

I've just got my hands on an advance copy of the full list of fees for the new Ryanair credit card, and it's looking 
even more expensive than expected.
Last week I wrote that Ryanair would be limiting still further the way in which customers can avoid the £6 
administration fee charged per person, per flight on all bookings.
Only those customers using a Ryanair Cash Passport, a new branded pre-paid Mastercard, will sidestep the fee 
levied to everyone else paying for their flights with a debit or credit card.
The release shows the full extent of the additional fees that anyone who takes up this offer will be facing.
On top of the £6 cost of the card and the inactivity charge of £2.50 per month if the card if not used for six months, it 
seems that using the card will cost significantly more than the most travel cards on the market.
We now know that the card carries a 5.75 per cent foreign transaction fee - market average is about 2.75 per cent. 
That means that every time the card is used when abroad the currency will be calculated using the exchange rate 
set by Mastercard on the day of purchase plus 5.75 per cent.
And as well as that, there's a £2 foreign ATM charge and a £2 fee for using UK cash points and card holders will 
need to load the card with a minimum of £150 (other cards usually require £100).

Never a dull moment for Carolyn McCall, chief executive of EasyJet, which is 38 per cent owned by founder Sir 
Stelios Haji-Ioannou and his family. The low-cost European airline said in a Stock Exchange statement on Monday 
that Sir Stelios had notified it of his plans to set up another airline, Fastjet.
On Friday, the serial entrepreneur dropped an attempt to oust Rigas Doganis, EasyJet non-executive director. Ms 
McCall had been confident of defeating the challenge. But the scoreline looked like a draw when you considered 
that earlier in the week EasyJet had announced plans to pay ordinary and special dividends totalling £190m. Sir 
Stelios has long campaigned for pay-outs to shareholders.
Where detail is lacking, supposition may fill the gaps. So it would be a mistake to read too much into the 
appearance in cyberspace of a crimson webpage announcing "Fastjet.com by Stelios. Coming soon!"
We do not know whether Fastjet would compete head-on with EasyJet, whose brand Sir Stelios has committed to 
enhancing. It would be an odd move for the Greek Cypriot entrepreneur to create a venture that cannibalised the 
revenues of a business in which he and his family are the dominant shareholders. However, some overlap appears 
possible. In a brief statement alleging "a smear campaign" by EasyJet, he said that he had "terminated" the effect of 
a comfort letter that he sent to EasyJet last year. Its provisions included an undertaking not to acquire an interest in 
an airline licensed by a country in the European Economic Area or by Switzerland.
Other shareholders - and Ms McCall - can therefore be forgiven any queasiness they feel at the advent of Fastjet. 
Sir Stelios revolutionised the European airline industry in the nineties, pioneering a low-cost model previously 
deployed in the US by carriers such as Southwest Airlines. It is questionable whether he could shake up the 
Fastjet could leave EasyJet feeling queasy
industry again, given that EasyJet and Ryanair have plucked so much of the low-hanging fruit. But you would be 
brave to bet against him.
Ill-starred
There is a certain consistency to the pivotal role played by Barclays in the cross-border financing deals that US tax 
authorities claim were intended to generate artificial foreign tax credits. In the run-up to the publication of Sir John 
Vickers' report on UK bank regulation, rumours circulated that Barclays might relocate its headquarters to New York 
if the conclusions were too irksome.
A flexible approach to borders is a hallmark of the archetypal all-conquering multinational as described by admiring 
neoliberals in the nineties and early noughties. It took the financial and philosophical failure of efficient market 
theories during the credit crunch to reassert the supremacy of nation states.
In fact, the zing had begun to vanish from Stars - structured trust advantaged repackaged securities - a year or so 
before Lehman's collapse. Even the laisser faire Bush administration was uncomfortable with the scope of Stars-
style deals, in which many banks engaged, for generating US tax credits.
But depressed developed economies make it tougher to get new tax arbitrage deals off the ground, for all the 
hubristic crowing of anonymous proponents. First, the profits and liquidity are not there to support the transactions. 
That was what killed off tax-driven aircraft finance in the nineties. Second, cash-strapped governments are less 
permissive towards loopholes than revenue-rich predecessors.
Meanwhile, Barclays' involvement in Stars deals - and litigation between its partner banks and the Inland Revenue 
Service - means that the US might not welcome the bank very warmly were it inclined to move there.
Birds of a feather
It is customary for companies that have agreed a takeover to stress the similarity of their cultures. This can 
sometimes sound like wishful thinking. Many combinations fail because of incompatibility. However, the £230m 
acquisition of consulting engineers Halcrow by CH2M Hill of the US has a decent chance of succeeding because 
both are substantially owned by employees.
The deal therefore resembles an engagement in a religious community that discourages "marrying out". About 26 
per cent of Halcrow's shares belong to its workers. The balance is held by a trust in whose decision-making 
employees have an indirect say. CH2M Hill is, for its part, 100 per cent owned by its 23,500 staff. Trustees and staff 
shareholders in Halcrow, whose trading flagged last year, can thus neatly rebut suggestions that they are "selling 
out" the community-spirited ideals that underpin their business.

Credit cards have fallen out of favour with British shoppers, as consumers eschew high interest rates in favour of 
sensible spending and turn to debit cards.
Some 40 years after they were introduced, credit cards have suffered a reversal in popularity after years of growth.
Figures from the UK Cards Association, passed to the Financial Times, reveal that debit cards outnumber credit 
cards, indicating a big change in consumer attitudes to spending and borrowing during the past decade.
Between 2000 and 2005 credit card use in the UK accelerated, as high consumer appetite for borrowing and fierce 
competition from providers drove up demand. The number of cards in this period rose from 47m to 70m.
But in the middle of the decade borrowers re-thought their spending habits, and reduced their credit card use years 
before the credit crisis came along.
Paul Rodford, head of card payments at the UK Card Association, said no single factor could explain the falling 
popularity of credit cards. The change, he insisted, had been led by consumers rather than regulatory change.
"This was not some sixth sense anticipation of the crisis to come, but rather a variety of things," Mr Rodford said. 
"By 2005 the market was saturated, and there was an increase in negative coverage from the media surrounding 
debt and the costs associated with credit cards.
"There was also an increase in home equity release, which let individuals use their mortgages to borrow on."
Credit card spending slows
By the end of the decade the number of credit cards in the UK fell to 55.6m, and outstanding balances were £10bn 
lower.
Banking customers have turned to debit cards. Spending on debit cards doubled in the five years to 2010. By 2010 
some 84m cards were in circulation in the UK.
Those consumers who still use credit cards have become more cautious about outstanding debts. Last year almost 
two-thirds of borrowers paid off the full sum owned each month, compared with about half in 2005.
Providers appear to have reacted to the changing customer spending habits by raising costs for credit cards.
The Co-operative Bank, Sainsbury's and Santander charge monthly fees for some of their credit cards, and other 
providers have introduced fees that penalise low usage.
A recently launched prepay Ryanair-branded MasterCard will levy a fee of £2.50 if the card is not used for six 
months.

Travellers who use a new Ryanair-branded pre-paid credit card will be able to reclaim the airline's online booking 
fees - but will be charged for other purchases made on the card, and will not receive the level of protection offered 
by other credit cards.
Despite being subject to an ongoing investigation by the Office of Fair Trading into surcharges by airlines for card 
payments, the budget carrier, led by chief executive Michael O'Leary, has announced that it will continue to apply 
its £6 "administration fee" to all passengers who pay for flights using cards other than the Ryanair Cash Passport 
card.
Booking charges will still be added to the bills of customers using the card, but cardholders will then receive a 
voucher equal to the sum they paid in charges, which can be redeemed on future Ryanair bookings. However, the 
card itself carries a number of additional fees. It costs £6 to buy, and charges a £2 fee for withdrawing cash at 
ATMs and a 50p charge for all other card transactions except Ryanair bookings - plus an inactivity fee of £2.50 if 
the card is not used in six months.
Airline ticket buyers are estimated to have spent £300m on booking fees last year and airlines including EasyJet 
and Lufthansa's BMI are being investigated by the Office of Fair Trading over surcharges for accepting debit and 
credit card payments.
Since the OFT investigation began, one carrier, Monarch, announced that it would remove its debit card fee and cut 
credit card charges. But other airlines reacted more aggressively. EasyJet increased its fees for debit cards from 
£5.50 to £8, and raised credit card fees from £8 to £12.95 in April. Ryanair charges £6 per person, per flight, for all 
bookings made.
Ryanair credit card fees warning
Critics have pointed out that the fees do not fairly represent costs incurred by airlines. Processing debit cards 
typically costs less than 50p, and credit cards between £2 and £3.
In the past, Ryanair allowed customers to avoid booking fees by using an Electron card. This was then changed to 
a prepaid MasterCard, and will now be limited to the Ryanair Cash Passport card.
Ryanair recently announced that its pre-tax profits for the three months to June were up 50 per cent on the previous 
year.

Aer Lingus has rejected calls by Ryanair, its largest shareholder, for the Irish flag-carrier to pay a special dividend.
Colm Barrington, Aer Lingus chairman, has told Ryanair that the carrier's board is sticking by its view of May's 
annual meeting that a dividend should be considered once a "more durable" economic recovery is apparent.
However, Mr Barrington welcomed Ryanair's statement this month that it could be willing to sell its 29.8 per cent 
stake in Aer Lingus.
Aer Lingus and Ryanair have been locked in a fractious relationship since Europe's largest low-cost airline by 
revenue launched the first of two failed takeover bids in 2006. Both bids faltered after objections by the Irish 
government and European competition authorities.
In a letter to Mr Barrington, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, this month called for the payment of a special 
dividend by Aer Lingus because it had gross cash of more than EUR900m (£788m, $1.2bn).
Aer Lingus has not paid a dividend since its flotation in 2006, and in a letter to Mr O'Leary sent on Thursday, Mr 
Barrington said: "At the time of the AGM we stated that 'the board continues to evaluate the respective merits of 
balance sheet strength and payment of a dividend to shareholders. The board believes that it is in the best interests 
of all shareholders to consider a dividend when there is a more durable recovery and consequent earnings 
visibility'. This remains our position."
He added that the board had already told Ryanair it had "no right to force Aer Lingus to accede to demands 
regarding the payment of a dividend".
Aer Lingus rejects Ryanair 's pay-out call
Mr O'Leary had also sought assurances that the company would not increase its contributions into a pension 
scheme jointly sponsored by Aer Lingus without prior shareholder approval.
The company said at its half-year results last month that there was an estimated actuarial deficit of EUR400m in 
one pension scheme involving Aer Lingus.
The company added it believed it had no responsibility for the deficit, but said its view might be challenged in the 
courts.
Mr Barrington said the board had the power to determine what payments were made into the pension schemes it 
was involved in.
He added Aer Lingus had "met all its obligations" to the pension schemes, but was working with trustees and 
employee groups to try to find solutions to outstanding issues.
Ryanair said it would respond to Mr Barrington's letter in due course.
Aer Lingus faces a possible change of ownership after the Irish government said this month it was willing to sell its 
25 per cent stake in the carrier. It added it did not want Ryanair to buy its stake.

Ryanair has intensified its confrontation with Aer Lingus by demanding that the Irish flag-carrier pay a special 
dividend to shareholders.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, on Wednesday made a scathing attack on Aer Lingus's board and 
management, and sought assurances that shareholders would have no liability for the large deficit in a pension 
scheme involving the Irish carrier.
Ryanair has a 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, but last week Europe's leading low-cost airline ruled out bidding for 
the Dublin government's 25 per cent shareholding in the Irish carrier.
Ryanair's stance could pave the way for a takeover of Aer Lingus by another airline. Ryanair has attempted two 
takeovers of Aer Lingus since 2006, but both failed after objections by the Dublin government and European 
competition authorities.
Aer Lingus declined to respond to Ryanair's comments.
In a letter to Colm Barrington, Aer Lingus's chairman, Mr O'Leary highlighted that the Irish carrier's gross cash 
position had increased by EUR34.4m to EUR919.4m at June 30. He also drew attention to Aer Lingus's move to 
push back a delivery of new aircraft from 2013-14 to 2018 at the earliest.
"This rise in Aer Lingus's cash and deferral of aircraft capex until 2018 clearly allows the board of Aer Lingus to 
consider and pay a special dividend of say EUR0.20 per share [a total of about EUR110m] to shareholders during 
2011," said Mr O'Leary.
Ryanair steps up Aer Lingus confrontation
He went on to complain that Aer Lingus's share price had fallen 80 per cent since 2007, and accused the Irish 
carrier's management of "catastrophic mismanagement", including in relation to taxation matters.
Analysts said one impediment to a takeover of Aer Lingus could be the company's obligations towards two pension 
schemes relating to its past and current workers.
At its interim results last month, Aer Lingus said one of the pension schemes was estimated to have an actuarial 
deficit of EUR400m last December 31.
It added that the company's stance that it has no responsibility for the deficit could be challenged in the courts. "If, 
contrary to the firm legal advice that the company has received, a court were to find against the company in any 
such litigation, significant or very significant loss could arise," said Aer Lingus.

A record number of passengers passed through Heathrow last month despite the disruptions to schedules caused 
by hurricane Irene which played havoc with flights to the east coast of the US.
The rise in Heathrow passenger numbers helped offset a reduction in the number of travellers passing through 
Stansted, the UK home of budget airline Ryanair, and other UK airports.
BAA, the Spanish-controlled group, on Monday said that 6.6m passengers passed through Heathrow in August, an 
increase of 0.7 per cent, or 46,000 travellers, from a year ago.
The group, which also owns Edinburgh and Glasgow airports as well as Southampton, said the figures were a 
record for the month, and added that the airport's load factor - the number of aircraft seats occupied - was 82.2 per 
cent, which was also a record.
But passenger numbers at Stansted shrunk 5 per cent compared to August 2010, which BAA attributed to cuts in 
capacity by cost-conscious airlines.
BAA, which is controlled by a consortium led by Spain's Ferrovial, has already sold Gatwick airport and has been 
ordered by the Competition Commission to sell Stansted to improve competition in the south east. It has also been 
ordered to sell one of Scotland's two main airports in an effort to cut its market dominance.
But the airport group is considering seeking a judicial review in response to the competition watchdog's final 
decision in the case, which started in 2007 after a referral by the Office of Fair Trading.
Record number of passengers use Heathrow
BAA sold London Gatwick for £1.5bn in December 2009 to a consortium led by Global Infrastructure Partners, a 
process it started before the competition watchdog's original ruling in an attempt to pre-empt the outcome.
Since then, the ruling to dispose of two more airports has been delayed by a series of legal challenges, which have 
so far failed to reverse the regulator's decision.
UK domestic travel also fell, contracting in August by 5.5 per cent year-on-year, with Heathrow bearing the brunt of 
the slippage, reporting domestic air traffic down by 13.2 per cent.
However, passenger numbers at BAA's Scottish airports rose strongly, with a 3 per cent increase at Edinburgh, 5.5 
per cent rise at Glasgow and 6.7 per cent at Aberdeen. Across all BAA's UK airports passenger numbers edged up 
by just 0.2 per cent, or 13,000 passengers, to 10.7m.
The impact of hurricane Irene, which lashed the east coast of the US in late August, held back passenger numbers 
from Heathrow to North America. However, London's main airport still reported an increase of passenger numbers 
of 71,000 during the month.
"These figures are particularly notable given the impact of hurricane Irene. BAA estimates that about 40,000 
additional passengers would have travelled through Heathrow had it not been for the hurricane," the airports group 
said on Monday.
Air transport fell by 0.2 per cent across BAA's UK airports - the fifth time in past 6 months air cargo tonnage has 
dropped at BAA's airports.
"This is consistent with wider air cargo industry trends as the growth in world trade decelerates," the group said.

Airlines including EasyJet, Lufthansa's BMI and Flybe are being investigated by the Office of Fair Trading over 
hidden surcharges for using debit and credit cards.
The OFT said on Thursday that it had opened a formal investigation into "a number of airlines" that it did not name. 
The probe follows a warning by the regulator in June that retailers that levy artificially high fees for card payments, 
or do not advertise fees charged, face action under consumer protection laws.
The OFT was pressed to look into the issue after Which?, the consumer group, drew up in March a list of retailers 
including estate agents, insurers and airlines, that used "excessive" fees on debit cards, often springing them on 
their customers at the last moment. Budget airlines including Ryanair were picked out as particular offenders.
Consumers in the UK buying travel tickets are estimated to have spent £300m on surcharges last year. The OFT 
said in June that it would lobby the government to change the law to ban surcharging on debit cards.
The OFT is examining whether the companies complied with consumer-protection legislation. The watchdog can 
demand undertakings from companies to stop certain practices it deems unfair. If they do not, the OFT must take 
the companies to court and it would be for the court to levy an eventual unlimited fine.
Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, declined to comment on whether it had been contacted by the OFT.
Ryanair charges £6 a person for each flight when credit or debit cards are used to purchase tickets, although the 
airline describes the arrangement as an "administration fee". It said: "Since Ryanair don't levy either credit card or 
debit card fees, we do not believe that this investigation or its outcome will have any effect on us."
Watchdog investigates airlines over hidden fees
EasyJet, Europe's second largest low-cost airline, charges £8 per booking when credit or debit cards are used, 
which means the fee can cover a group of people rather than just one individual. EasyJet declined to comment.
Flybe, the UK regional airline, confirmed it had been contacted by the OFT. "We can also confirm that we have had 
constructive and positive early discussions with the OFT and look forward to working with them to resolving these 
important issues," it said.
Lufthansa, the German airline that operates flights out of Heathrow, also confirmed it had been contacted by the 
OFT. "We received a letter from the OFT and we will of course look into this letter and provide the necessary 
information," Lufthansa said.
Lufthansa added that BMI, its subsidiary that also operates flights from Heathrow, had received a separate letter 
from the OFT asking for information.
The OFT has long scrutinised business practices among airlines. It separately fined British Airways a record 
£121.5m in 2007 for fixing with Virgin Atlantic the price of fuel surcharges. A related criminal trial - the first 
contested prosecution of price-fixing the OFT brought - of four current and former BA executives collapsed last year 
after the emergence of thousands of new documents from Virgin Atlantic's databases during the trial.
BA has since signalled its unhappiness over the size of the fine, which is yet to be paid. The OFT must first issue its 
formal statement of objections - or its investigation's findings - which it is scheduled to do before the end of the 
month.

Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, has ruled out a quick sale of the government's one-quarter stake in the airline 
despite European Union pressure for a deal to ease the heavily-indebted nation's finances.
An Irish government report in June recommended selling the national airline along with ports and power stations as 
part of plans to raise EUR5bn (£4.4bn, $7.2bn) to repair Ireland's accounts.
Andrew Macfarlane, Aer Lingus' chief financial officer, said he would be "surprised if a deal was to happen in the 
current year". "The likely proceeds would be fairly small compared with the government's financial problems and it's 
hard to see who would be the buyer."
Ryanair, which is keen to purchase the airline, holds a near 30 per cent share in Aer Lingus, the legacy of two 
hostile takeover attempts in 2006 and 2008, which were flatly rejected by the Irish government and European 
regulators as anticompetitive.
The Office for Fair Trading has recently said it would again challenge Ryanair over its shareholding.
The Irish government has pledged to keep at least two airlines crossing the channel to protect tourist numbers: 55 
per cent of Aer Lingus's revenues are derived from customers travelling to Ireland.
Joe Gill, analyst at Bloxham Securities, said: "The Irish government needs reassurances about the strategic links 
provided by Aer Lingus to Ireland so a quick sale of its 25 per cent stake is unlikely."
Aer Lingus shuns quick sale of state stake
There are other obstacles to a government sell-off, not least a fractious relationship with the unions, which disrupted 
flights for a month and cost the airline EUR15m in the first half of this year. The group reported an operating loss of 
EUR27.8m for the first half of 2011, up from EUR19m a year ago, as a result of the conflict, which involved a 
dispute over staff rostering changes.
Mr Macfarlane acknowledged that the airline faced the threat of either legal action or further confrontation with 
employees as it sought to resolve a EUR400m pension deficit. Trustees have until the end of this year to propose a 
solution, which is likely to include a cut to benefits or an increase in contributions from the 5,000 employees still 
paying into the 15,000-member fund. Aer Lingus has 3,000 members of staff but the scheme also covers other 
employers at Dublin Airport. "If trustees ask staff to increase contributions we may find ourselves in line for trouble," 
said Mr Macfarlane.
Despite this, Aer Lingus said strong bookings for the second half of 2011 meant its full-year profits would be better 
than expected and the airline was on track to achieve EUR80m of cost savings by the end of the year.
Aer Lingus has recently pulled back from the low-cost airline business model and increased average fares, a 
strategy that paid off with an 8.4 per cent increase in yield per passenger compared with a year ago and despite a 1 
per cent fall in passenger numbers.
.......................................................................
- FT Comment
Aer Lingus's share price has fallen 46 per cent since the start of the year as confidence was dented by the industrial 
action and doubts over its growth potential. But the stock rose more than 9 per cent on Wednesday to EUR0.645 as 
investors endorsed the management's strategy, which has stabilised cash levels in a ropey economy. Despite the 
pension deficit issues, the shares, which trade on 9.7 times earnings for 2011, versus 12 times for the EU airline 
sector, are ready to fly.

Tony Fernandes was in typically pugnacious mood on Friday, telling followers of his rambunctious Twitter feed that 
"sales are kick-ass" as he headed for London on AirAsia X, his long-haul budget airline.
It was a typically exuberant comment by Mr Fernandes, the British-educated Malaysian entrepreneur whose AirAsia 
group of low-cost carriers is fast becoming an Asian business phenomenon.
As he prepares for second-quarter results next week, though, Mr Fernandes is facing concerns that his latest coup - 
a deal giving him effective control of Malaysian Airline System, the venerable Malaysian flag-carrier - may risk 
stretching his entrepreneurial drive too far for comfort.
Short, rotund and perennially effervescent, Mr Fernandes has emerged over the past decade as one of Asia's 
boldest and most successful entrepreneurs, establishing an empire ranging from airlines to telecoms through his 
privately held Tune Group of companies.
Relentlessly informal - he usually sports a bright red baseball cap and is never seen in a tie - Mr Fernandes, 47, has 
shaken Asia's state-dominated aviation industry by the throat since buying AirAsia and two old planes from the 
Malaysian government through Tune for just M$1 in 2001.
Inspired by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of the UK budget airline EasyJet, Mr Fernandes also soaked up some 
of the swashbuckling spirit of Sir Richard Branson while working after university as an accountant at Virgin 
Communications.
Concerns raised on AirAsia chief's focus
Like his role models, Mr Fernandes has a keen eye for the brand-building value of publicity - hence the never-
ending stream of Twitter posts, along with more substantial ventures such as his Lotus Formula One racing team 
and attempts to buy West Ham, the English premiership football club.
Sir Richard has remained a long-term supporter as Mr Fernandes turned AirAsia - floated on the Kuala Lumpur 
stock market in 2004 - into the region's fastest-growing budget airline. Its 100-plus red and white Airbus A320s are 
garishly visible at airports from New Zealand to China, and India to Japan.
Along the way he has found time to launch associate budget carriers in Indonesia and Thailand, with a further 
offshoot due to start in Vietnam later this year, and a Japanese offshoot being planned in a joint venture with All 
Nippon Airways.
He has also defied industry norms with the launch in 2007 of AirAsia X as an affiliated but separately owned long-
haul budget carrier, and delivered a relentless focus on costs. Analysts say that has made AirAsia even more 
efficient than Southwest Airlines, the US carrier that invented the low-cost model, or Ryanair, its best-known 
European exponent.
However, people with knowledge of the MAS deal say there are concerns within AirAsia and elsewhere over 
whether Mr Fernandes is stretching himself too thin.
The deal, concluded on Tuesday and officially presented as a partnership, gives Tune 20.5 per cent of MAS, two 
board seats and an unofficial veto over top management. In return the government gets two board seats at AirAsia, 
a 10 per cent holding in the airline and a similar stake in unlisted AirAsia X.
The effect is to remove MAS as a competitor in the budget sector, both domestically and internationally. But Mr 
Fernandes also becomes a significant shareholder in MAS, which means he now has interests in five airlines, with 
two more expected to launch in the next year, in addition to a Formula One team and the hotel, financial services 
and telecoms interests of Tune Group.
The worry is that all these interests may leave Mr Fernandes too little time for the daily focus on cost-control that he 
has identified as the key to long-term success. However, this is an issue Mr Fernandes has faced before, and 
dismissed with derision. "Just because one person might only be able to do one thing at a time doesn't mean all of 
us are the same," he told the FT last year.

Tony Fernandes, chief executive of AirAsia, is one of the region's boldest and most successful entrepreneurs. But is 
his decision to take a stake in lossmaking Malaysian Airline System another masterstroke, or a disastrous mistake? 
The answer may depend on whether his ego has swamped his business sense.
So far, Mr Fernandes has hardly put a step wrong. As a serial entrepreneur, he has founded no fewer than four 
airlines - AirAsia, its long-haul affiliate Air­Asia X and joint ventures in Indonesia and Thailand. He is also part-
owner, with his business partner, of the privately held Tune Group, which runs hotel, financial services and mobile 
phone businesses.
When he bought AirAsia through Tune for a token M$1 plus M$40m debt in 2001, it was a failing state-owned 
regional carrier with two aircraft. It now has more than 100 planes, and has just signed an $18bn deal with Airbus 
for 200 A320s over 15 years - the third-biggest order in the aircraft maker's history.
Investors are in no doubt about Mr Fernandes' Midas touch. The shares have outperformed the global aviation 
index by more than 100 per cent since AirAsia was floated in 2004. No carrier has bettered its average 57 per cent 
annual increase in net income. The stock, up almost a third this year before the latest turmoil, was worth $3.6bn 
before the shares were suspended on Monday. That is more than double the market value of the Malaysian flag-
carrier.
Of course, AirAsia benefits from being in the right place at the right time. Its pace of growth is underpinned by the 
rapid expansion of emerging Asian economies. Average economic growth of about 7 per cent a year is lifting 
millions more people every year to an economic level at which they can afford a budget airline flight.
AirAsia's MAS stake could be flight of fancy
But Mr Fernandes is not just grabbing chunks of a growing market. AirAsia has grown consistently, as well as fast, 
thanks to a rigorous focus on expenses. Costs per passenger kilometre are lower than both Southwest Airlines of 
the US, which invented the low-cost model, and Ryanair, the Irish group often regarded as the world's most 
competitive carrier.
By contrast, state-owned MAS has failed either to adapt to the low-cost era, or to trade effectively as a premium 
carrier, the strategy pursued (albeit with faltering success) by neighbouring Singapore Airlines. MAS has had to be 
restructured twice in the past nine years following financial crises, and is now in trouble again, losing $79m in the 
quarter to March. The second-quarter result, due shortly, is expected to be equally dire.
Angered by the airline's resistance to change and worried by the looming cost of fleet renewal, the government has 
given up, forcing MAS to accept a deal, confirmed on Tuesday, under which Tune will take a 20.5 per cent stake in 
return for a 10 per cent holding in AirAsia. Khazanah Nasional, the sovereign wealth fund that owns MAS, will also 
buy 10 per cent of unlisted AirAsia X.
For Mr Fernandes, this is a moment to savour. Never shy of self-promotion, he has been hurt and offended over the 
years by the Malaysian elite, which has largely regarded him as a comic upstart. They laughed when he started in 
business with two old aircraft and $250,000; they laughed again when he spoke of building AirAsia into the region's 
most successful airline, when he launched a Formula One racing team and when he tried to buy an English 
Premiership football club.
Their laughter has now ceased. But it would be ironic if Mr Fernandes' moment of recognition turned out to be a 
millstone round his neck. This is not an inconsiderable risk. The deal was officially characterised as a partnership, 
but would be better seen as a last-chance rescue. Both earlier restructurings of MAS failed to resolve its underlying 
problems, and Azman Mokhtar, the head of Khazanah, has spent years putting it through a reform programme, to 
little effect.
The government hopes the freewheeling Mr Fernandes will provide the missing ingredient. Perhaps he will. But 
focusing his efforts on the fading flag-carrier would surely divert inordinate amounts of time from running AirAsia 
and its offshoots, which are soon to be joined by a Tokyo-based joint venture with ANA of Japan. With Singapore-
based rival Tiger Airways in trouble - suspended from flying in Australia on safety grounds, and bleeding S$2m a 
week - this is not the moment for Mr Fernandes to take his eye off the ball.
All the signals are that he will not. Indeed, all the obvious gains will accrue to AirAsia: route rationalisation is likely to 
favour the lower cost operator, and the deal should reboot government thinking on awarding new routes, on which it 
has tended to favour MAS. Mr Fernandes will aim to push MAS upmarket, and try to close Firefly, the flag-carrier's 
largely domestic budget offshoot, leaving AirAsia with a local monopoly. If he can help MAS recover, he will. But not 
at AirAsia's expense. Recognition is sweet. But victory is sweeter.

Ryanair on Wednesday said it had filed complaints with regulators alleging that BAA had abused its monopoly 
position and overcharged airlines at Stansted airport.
The action takes place only days after Britain's largest airport owner was told by the Competition Commission that it 
must begin selling off Stansted and one of its Scottish hubs. Colin Matthews, BAA chief executive, suggested 
Ryanair had raised its complaints to push through a sale at a lower price that would force a new operator to impose 
cheaper landing charges.
"Ryanair is a great customer of ours and we work hard to stay in agreement with them. But they have a clear 
interest in a sale. The lower the price, the better the chance that they will pay lower charges."
Mr Matthews indicated yesterday that he may seek a judicial review in advance of the September 13 deadline. The 
sale has been successfully delayed before and a judicial review could stall the sale process until at least 2012 even 
if it were to be unsuccessful.
"We need to do more work on the detail but there is no reason to wait until the last minute," Mr Matthews said.
Ryanair, which accounts for 70 per cent of the traffic at Stansted, said it had instructed lawyers to file a complaint 
against BAA with the Civil Aviation Authority and Competition Commission.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, accused BAA of "screwing airlines" by raising prices from EUR3.30 per 
passenger to EUR6.60 per passenger during the past five years despite a 24 per cent fall in traffic over the period. 
Airlines including Ryanair and Air Berlin were being forced to cut routes and services as a result, he said.
Ryanair files complaints with regulators against BAA
"Any company that has suffered a 30 per cent decline in business over the past five years would respond by cutting 
its prices. Instead, BAA Stansted monopoly's response has been to double its passenger charges, making Stansted 
Airport uncompetitive, but generating monopoly profits for the BAA."
Ryanair's complaint was made as BAA reported a narrowing of pre-tax losses from £167.4 in the first six months of 
2010 to £116.9m in the same period this year. Passenger numbers at its airports increased 7.1 per cent to 41.4m, 
but the figures were flattered by the comparison with April 2010, when thousands of flights were grounded by the 
Iceland's ash cloud.

High fuel costs take toll on Ryanair

The soaring price of fuel offset large increases in revenues and passenger numbers at Ryanair, forcing the Irish 
low-cost airline to miss analysts' profit forecasts.
Net profit at the Dublin-based carrier rose by 1 per cent, in spite of passenger numbers jumping 18 per cent to 
21.3m in the three months to June 30.
Revenues grew by almost 30 per cent to EUR1.2bn, driven by an 11 per cent increase in fares and an 18 per cent 
jump in traffic at the group, which operates more than 1,500 flights a day.
The increase in traffic was flattered by the comparative period in 2010, when Ryanair was forced to cancel 9,400 
flights due to the Icelandic volcanic eruption.
However, fuel costs rose by almost half to EUR427m at Europe's largest low-cost airline by passenger numbers, 
biting into net profit, which edged up from EUR138.5m to EUR139.3m year-on-year but missed analysts' consensus 
forecasts of EUR156.8m.
In spite of the setback, Ryanair maintained its full-year profit forecast of EUR400m and said its fuel requirements for 
the year were 90 per cent hedged at $860 a tonne.
"This result is testimony to the strength of Ryanair's lowest fares/lowest cost model, which continues to deliver profit 
and traffic growth despite the recession and high oil prices," said Michael O'Leary, chief executive.
High fuel costs take toll on Ryanair
Ancillary sales - fees for checked baggage, priority boarding and debit and credit card charges - grew 22 per cent to 
EUR248m.
Earlier this month the Office of Fair Trading called for an end to the debit card surcharges imposed by travel 
companies, which are often added at the final stage of a transaction. Budget airlines, including Ryanair, are oppose 
to the proposal, but are developing other ways to boost turnover.
"We have recently started trials of 'reserved seating' for 21 extra legroom seats on selected routes for a fee of 
EUR10 per seat," Mr O'Leary said. "If successful we will roll out reserved seating across more of our network this 
winter."
Mr O'Leary also bemoaned a 40 per cent jump in charges imposed in airlines operating from Dublin airport, "which 
has led to winter capacity cuts by Ryanair and many other carriers", he said.
Ryanair shares, which have fallen by 14 per cent over the past 12 months, on Monday slipped 8.2 cents, or 2.4 per 
cent, to EUR3.38 in early Dublin trading.

Ryanair has scaled back its expansion plans in the face of high fuel prices and expects a wave of deal-making as 
weak airlines seek wealthy backers.
With airlines facing $100 a barrel oil, the low-cost carrier said there would be a period of consolidation in which four 
large airline groups would dominate the continental market in a few years. Fuel cost Ryanair EUR140m more in the 
three months to June than in the same period a year ago, a 50 per cent increase.
International Airlines Group, formed of the 2010 merger of BA and Iberia, is rumoured to be interested in TAP, the 
Portuguese Airline, while Lufthansa has been tipped to purchase SAS, the Scandinavian carrier.
Howard Millar, chief financial officer, said: "Once we get over $100 a barrel, it's a tipping point. We expect the 
consolidation process to continue and capacity to come out of the airline industry.
"We believe we are into an era of high oil prices. Nobody believes we will see $20 or $30 a barrel again."
Ryanair shares slipped 1.65 per cent to close at EUR3.41 as it admitted that "stubbornly high" fuel costs had 
squeezed its own profits growth and it expects passenger numbers to fall for the first time in its history this winter.
The company missed analysts' forecasts of EUR151m with net profits up just 1 per cent to EUR139.3m in the three 
months to June 30. But in spite of the setback, Ryanair maintained its full-year profit forecast of EUR400m and said 
its fuel requirements for the year were 90 per cent hedged at $820 a tonne.
Rising fuel prices clip Ryanair 's wings
While confirming there would be short-term pain as the industry contracts, Ryanair said rivals' fuel price surcharges 
and the tough economic backdrop were making its own fares more attractive. "Generally we love a good recession," 
said Mr Millar.
Passenger numbers rose 18 per cent to 21m in the three months to June although the comparisons with last year's 
total were flattered by the impact of the Icelandic ash cloud in April 2010, which grounded 9,400 of its flights across 
Europe.
Passenger growth was expected to slow to 4 per cent in the winter, said the airline, but it would offset the impact on 
profits by grounding 80 aircraft over the winter and raising ticket prices this year and in 2012. Average fares rose 11 
per cent to EUR43 a seat - still lower than its 2007 price of EUR45 a seat - but are expected to rise further this 
summer.
Ryanair has been increasing the proportion of revenues from add-on services such as baggage check-in fees and 
priority boarding.
Ancillary sales grew 22 per cent to EUR248m in the quarter and now make up 21 per cent of total revenues. As part 
of that strategy, and like Easyjet , its rival, which is targeting business customers, the carrier said it was trialling 
reserved seating on selected routes at a cost of EUR5 for positions with extra legroom at the front of the aircraft or 
by escape hatches.
The airline was quick to counter criticisms of its baggage levy, saying the charge had been brought in to lighten 
loads and to consolidate its environmental position. "We've got to change consumer habits. We've got Mrs Millar 
down from seven pairs of shoes down to three pairs of shoes," Mr Millar said.
Ryanair also said it would sue BAA, the UK airports operator, for what it contends are inflated charges at Stansted 
airport. "The Stansted cost base has been artificially boosted. We think they have been increasing their costs so 
they can jack up the charges on us," Mr Millar said.
BAA said: "As of Friday we hadn't received anything from Ryanair. We'd obviously need to see what their case is 
before we could properly respond. Our charges are set by our regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, so it's difficult 
to understand what case Ryanair could have."
The soaring price of fuel offset large increases in revenues and passenger numbers at Ryanair, forcing the Irish 
low-cost airline to miss analysts' profit forecasts.
Net profit at the Dublin-based carrier rose by 1 per cent, in spite of passenger numbers jumping 18 per cent to 
21.3m in the three months to June 30.
Revenues grew by almost 30 per cent to EUR1.2bn ($1.7bn), driven by an 11 per cent increase in fares and an 18 
per cent jump in traffic at the group, which operates more than 1,500 flights a day.

Pressure mounted on European banks on Monday after rating agency Moody's warned that default on Greek debt 
was now almost certain.
As peripheral debt yields climbed the main stock indices fell. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.2 per cent in 
morning trade to 1,107.09, with banks exerting the most pressure as investors were also wary of the continuing 
impasse in the US on the issue of raising the country's debt ceiling to avoid default.
"The probability of a distressed exchange, and hence a default, on Greek government bonds is virtually 100 per 
cent," the agency said. It added, however, that the EU programme and proposed debt exchanges would increase 
the likelihood that Greece would stabilise and eventually reduce its overall debt burden.
"While the Greek debt deal goes a long way to present a fundamental solution to avoid the risk of a disorderly, 
forced Greek default and another banking crisis, fundamental risks are set to stay," said Lena Komileva at Brown 
Brothers Harriman.
Belgian lender Dexia lost 4.9 per cent to EUR2.02, while Italy's Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena shed 4.4 per cent 
to EUR0.53 and Germany's Commerzbank eased 3 per cent to EUR2.74.
Greek stocks, however, climbed as the bounce that followed news of the country's EUR159bn bail-out late last 
week continued. The Athens General climbed 0.5 per cent to 1,292.8.
National Bank of Greece nudged 0.6 per cent higher to EUR5.39, while EFG Eurobank added 1.3 per cent to 
EUR3.19.
Banks hit as Moody's downgrades Greece
In Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, the largely nationalised institution, remained flat at EUR0.12 despite making a 
EUR2.2bn underlying loss in the first half. Investors were cheered by the bank's assertion that 2011 would be the 
last year of major loan impairments.
Bank of Ireland, meanwhile stayed out public control after the state sold a EUR1.1bn stake to a group of, as yet, 
unidentified investors. Shares climbed 8.9 per cent to EUR0.11.
Dublin's main stock index remained flat at 2,928.66, however, as shares in Ryanair, one of its weightiest stocks fell 
2.1 per cent to EUR3.39 following the release of second quarter profits that fell shy of expectations.

The Athens General index fell 1.3 per cent, with Alpha Bank down 6.1 per cent to EUR3.38 and National Bank of 
Greece off 4.5 per cent to EUR5.12.
Focus also returned to the possibility of contagion to other periphery countries, primarily Italy, forcing the country's 
banks sharply lower. Intesa Sanpaolo sank 8.3 per cent to EUR1.61, undermined also by JPMorgan cutting its price 
target on the stock. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Sienashed 7.6 per cent to EUR0.51 and UniCreditlost 7.1 per cent 
to EUR1.23.
Other banks considered to be heavily exposed to eurozone debt included Belgian lender Dexia, down 8.2 per cent 
to EUR1.95, while France's Crédit Agricoleslid 5.5 per cent to EUR8.91.

cent to EUR3.40 following the release of second-quarter profits that fell shy of expectations.
Fiat Industrial, the maker of tractors and commercial vehicles, was the Eurofirst's top stock, climbing 5.4 per cent to 
EUR9.47 as it raised its 2011 targets following a forecast-beating second-quarter profit performance. The company 
said it was now capable of paying a regular dividend.

Sale: Lyons Demesne: Works of art from the collection of the late Dr Tony Ryan
Location: Christie's, 8 King Street, London SW1 tel +44 (0)20 7839 1611
Date: Thursday (July 14). On view Sunday, 2pm-5pm; Monday 9am-4.30pm; Tuesday, 9am-8pm; Wednesday 9am-
4.30pm. Catalogue on line at www.christies.com
Need to know: Lyons Demesne was a grand house in a very sorry state when it was bought by the late airline 
tycoon Tony Ryan in 1996. The architectural gem at Ardclough, Co Kildare was commissioned by the first Lord 
Cloncurry from architect Oliver Grace in 1797 and had been among Ireland's finest houses until it became a 
satellite of University College, Dublin, which carved up its great rooms for use as laboratories.
But Ryan, the billionaire co-founder of Ryanair, was undaunted by the prospect of restoring the house and 
employed a crack team of architects, builders and craftsmen to return it to its former glory in less than three years. 
All that the philanthropist and patron of the arts had to do after that was to fill the house with the appropriate 
paintings and furniture - this 400-lot sale comprises a relatively small selection of what he amassed prior to his 
death in 2007.
Highlights: With estimates ranging from £300-£300,000, the sale is expected to realise more than £2m and is led by 
an impressive 18th-century pastel portrait of Arthur Hill, second Marquess of Downshire, drawn by Hugh Douglas 
Hamilton. Ryan bought it at a Christie's sale in 2000 for £377,750. In the same year, he paid £91,750 for a set of six 
Louis XV giltwood fauteuils which are now on offer at £40,000- £60,000 while a Joshua Reynolds portrait of a 
woman, bought at Sotheby's in 1999 for £140,000, is now estimated at £50,000- £80,000. Elsewhere, the sale is 
Sale of the week: An airline magnate's flights of fancy
replete with a diverse array of objects priced in the mid-range, including a large bird cage in the form of a 17th-
century mansion (£10,000-£15,000), drawings by Sir Edwin Landseer, Samuel Laurence and Augustus John, four-
poster beds, painted furniture, longcase clocks and marble sculptures - in short, all the essentials for decorating a 
magnificent country house.

If you plan to fly with a low-cost airline this summer, you will have discovered that the final bill was not so low cost 
after all. Additional charges, not just for baggage but for payment and even for checking in, have prompted a super 
complaint from the UK consumer organisation Which? and spurred the Office of Fair Trading into action.
And have you struggled to understand your mobile phone bill? Bought a cartridge of ink that costs almost as much 
as the printer? Do you fill in your personal details on an insurance comparison website every year, or just accept 
uncompetitive renewal terms? Have you used the internet or the minibar in a hotel, or watched the teaser offer on a 
mortgage revert to a standard variable rate?
Products are complex, and time is scarce. Consumers focus on a few headline prices and features when they make 
their choices and so competition is focused on those headline prices and features. Economics 101 teaches that 
markets work best when competition leads to prices in line with costs, but in markets like these, competition has the 
opposite effect. Producers do not necessarily make excessive profits overall because the prices of key features are 
forced down to uneconomic levels. No one can really give you a free mobile handset, or fly you to Bratislava for 
99p.
But the retailer with simple, honest pricing must seek to match these offers. If the winner of the competitive race is 
the company that is most innovative, not in productive efficiency or customer service, but in the ingenuity and 
opacity of its tariff structures, consumers will not be happy, or well served, in the long run.  Ryanair is 
simultaneously popular and despised.
Almost everyone, consumers and producers, would benefit if these practices stopped, despite the feeble attempts 
of lawyers, public relations people and economists to justify them. These hired guns argue, often correctly, that 
The $10 minibar beer is no basis for capitalism
consumers can, with sufficient diligence, obtain all the information they need. But most of us have better things to 
do than to engage in line-by-line scrutiny of our mobile phone bills, or undertake a discounted cash flow calculation 
of the lifetime cost of a £50 document printer. Thank goodness. Show me the person who has actually read the 
"important information" you must understand before entering the website of an institution rergulated by the Financial 
Services Authority, and I will show you a man who has difficulties with girls.
Small regulatory and legal changes might help. A general principle that charges for making payments must be 
related to the transactions' actual costs would both end some abuses and stimulate use of the cost-effective debit 
card system. Many people thought the law prohibited penalties in consumer contracts - disproportionate charges for 
minor infractions, such as late payment of credit card bills - until the courts decided otherwise. Legislation could 
reverse that position. Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein have usefully suggested that utility providers present bills 
in standardised machine readable form to facilitate price comparisons. In some cases, agreements between firms, 
brokered by the OFT and negotiated under the threat of extended regulatory investigation, might do the trick.
Many people may think the problem of the $10 minibar bottle of beer is unimportant in the context of financial crisis 
and global macroeconomic imbalances, or that the costs of a regulatory drive  would exceed the likely benefits. I 
disagree. Encouraging bad decisions through teaser mortgage rates was a central contributory factor in the 
financial crisis. Business practices whose rationale derives from consumer ignorance and producer knowledge 
create a larger problem. When people see many examples of minor exploitation of consumers in their daily lives, 
they will conclude that extensive exploitation is characteristic of business as a whole. And they may be right. If 
caveat emptor is seen as a dominant business principle by both producers and consumers then the legitimacy of 
capitalism and market organisation will not long survive.

Body
When it comes to hidden charges, the airline industry could teach fund managers a thing or two (and would no 
doubt charge them extra for the second thing, on an exponentially sliding scale based on size, weight and ability to 
be stowed in an overhead locker).
Take Ryanair, the amusingly self-styled "world's favourite airline". These are just some of its extra charges (if you 
think I'm making them up, just visit www.ryanair.com/en/terms-and-conditions): Priority Boarding Fee £5 (ie priority 
over the only three passengers who didn't pay the surcharge for this); Reserved Seating Fee £10 (only ensures 
avoidance of departure-gate stampede on selected routes); Checked Baggage Fee for first 15kg bag £15 (costs 
£10 more if going on summer holiday and packing fewer clothes); Name change fee £100 (unclear if this covers 
deed poll, or just name on ticket); Oxygen Reservation Fee £100 (unclear if this is applies to masks that should fall 
from cabin ceiling in event of emergency); Fee for Special Declaration of Valuable Baggage £100 (unclear if 
declaration is to tip wink to heavy-handed or light-fingered baggage handlers).
It was not surprising, then, that when the publicity-shy Irish airline suggested a £1 charge for using its onboard 
lavatories, most people thought it was serious. Whipped into a frenzy of indignation by the mid-market tabloids, 
outraged passengers sought advice from MoneySavingExpert.com - conjuring up an image of the eponymous 
expert leading by example and squirming cross-legged all the way from Stansted to Bratislava (ie 100 miles outside 
Bratislava) just to save a few quid.
It was, allegedly, a PR joke - but so ludicrous have "low-cost" airlines' surcharges become that stand-up comedians 
don't even bother using this material any more.
Investors are like passengers on managers' flights of fancy
However, there is one set of hidden charges that were never funny in the first place: 'administration fees' of up to £8 
buying a ticket with a debit card. So, following a 'super complaint' from Which? magazine, the Office of Fair Trading 
(OFT) this week announced that it would seek a change in the law to prohibit surcharging for debit card payments. 
As Cavendish Elithorn, senior director at the OFT, put it: "People are frustrated about being asked to pay for 
paying".
Not even the fund management industry would try to get away with this kind of charging, would it?
Well, as a long-standing campaigner against hidden investment charges, I was struck by similarities between the 
airlines' dubious practices and those of fund managers. Consider these aspects of the OFT complaint.
Failure to disclose upfront charges in plain language. In the original complaint, Which? wanted airlines "to tell 
consumers upfront if they have surcharges and how much they are - this needs to be in plain language in their 
advertising and promotions." I want fund managers to declare the total cost of investing upfront - at present they 
don't, because the not exactly plain-speaking 'total expense ratio' isn't total.
Charges disproportionate to provider's actual costs. Which? wanted its super-complaint to result in "fair charges - 
the costs to the consumer should be the same as the cost to the retailer  this shouldn't be a hidden way of making 
money". It calculated that the cost of processing a debit card payment was 20p, but airlines charge 40 times that 
amount. I want fund groups to stop charging investors a full 5 per cent if they pay their money directly to the 
manager - almost all still do this, taking more than £500 just for accepting a year's investment into an individual 
savings account (Isa). Assuming fund managers pay no more than airlines for processing debit card payments, their 
mark up is 2,500 times.
Difficulty in shopping around for lowest cost option. According to the OFT: "Consumers find it harder to shop around 
and find the best deal if they have to invest time and effort in discovering surcharges. This also weakens 
competition between retailers which is bad news for the UK economy." I heard echoes of the Financial Services 
Authority's remarks about the disclosure of costs on online fund platforms: "[They should be] upfront about the 
income they receive from fund managers [to] make it easier for advisers and consumers to compare different types 
of platform".
Disclosure of full costs too late in the process. In its investigation, the OFT found "considerable evidence of 
companies using 'drip pricing' practices - adding payment charges to the total price only after consumers have filled 
in a number of web pages during their purchase." I would argue that the fund management industry is worse - 
disclosing total costs, including sharedealing and stamp duty, only in annual reports that investors receive after 
parting with their money.
In the airline industry, the OFT estimates that these charges cost consumers £300m a year. In the fund 
management industry, however, investors could be paying "up to £5.8bn a year in hidden charges", according to 
Alan Miller of investment managers SCM Private.
My challenge, therefore, to both the OFT and Which?, is this: having gone after the easy targets in the budget 
airline sector, turn your attention to financial services. After all, the OFT claims that companies can "improve the 
transparency and presentation of other surcharges  quickly and easily." As passengers booked on the Ryanair 
departure to Bratislava might ask: "What are we waiting for?"

Budget airlines look set to oppose an order to stop charging fees to customers who pay with a debit card.
This week, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) called for an end to the debit card surcharges imposed by travel 
companies, which are often added at the very last stage of a transaction.
It wants the cost of processing debit cards, estimated to be 20p per transaction, to be absorbed into the price of the 
ticket. Costs forusing credit cards must also be clear to shoppers from the start of a transaction, the OFT said.
Which? has identified 16 airlines that charge customers for paying with a debit card, including Europe's largest low-
cost airline, Ryanair.
Budget airlines were found to be adding up to £8 to the price of a single ticket for paying with a debit card - costs 
that were "dripped" into the final price only after customers had almost completed the purchase.
Some carriers have already decided to remove fees. Monarch Airlines scrapped its 3.5 per cent debit card charge in 
June.
But Ryanair, which charges £6 per flight, per person, for payment with a debit card, insisted that its charges were 
"optional". It argued that customers can avoid a charge if they use a pre-paid MasterCard - a not widely-held 
payment card that comes with its own charges and a set-up fee.
Airlines oppose ruling on card fees
Flybe, which charges a £5.50 debit-card surcharge for a single flight, said that its charges were "clear and easily 
accessible from stage one of the booking process". Jet2, which charges a £4.99 flat rate, also claimed to be upfront 
about its non-optional charges.
BMIbaby, which levies a £4 charge for each person flying, even if payment is made on a single card, said it was 
investigating the new ruling and would work with the OFT.
Consumers in the UK buying travel tickets are estimated to have spent £300m on surcharges last year.
The OFT pointed out that other retailers that accept credit and debit cards, such as supermarkets and clothing 
shops, do not add charges for payment.
However, analysts have warned out that if debit card surcharges are banned, travel companies may seek to make 
up the cost elsewhere.
"It could mean higher fees for credit card use or baggage allowances later," said Bob Atkinson, travel analyst at 
Money­supermarket.com.

Higher fuel costs, disruption from last year's Icelandic volcanic eruption and severe winter weather combined to 
push Flybe into the red, as the UK regional airline prepares to expand into continental Europe.
Flybe reported a pre-tax loss of £4.3m in its first full-year results since it raised £60m through its flotation last 
December, compared to a profit of £24.6m the previous year. The results were in line with expectations following a 
profit warning last month.
Investors instead focused on management's slightly more upbeat tone about current trading, sending the shares up 
9.5 per cent, or 16p, on Thursday to 184p in late afternoon trading in London.
Jim French, chief executive, conceded that the shares were still a long way off the 295p float price but insisted that 
the company was supported by "long-term investors who are looking at our long-term strategy".
The strategy envisages expansion into continental Europe, either through acquisition or joint ventures, and Mr 
French said a deal was close to being signed.
"I would like to be in a position to announce something, but there will be confirmation of something I hope in the 
very near future," he said.
Flybe derives 85 per cent of revenues from the UK and is trying to reduce its dependence on its home market by 
expanding into continental Europe.
Volcanic ash costs Flybe £12m
Flybe, which operates from UK regional airports such as Birmingham and Southampton, estimated that the total 
impact from flight cancellations last year due to the volcanic ash cloud in April 2010 and the bad winter weather was 
£18.1m.
Excluding these setbacks, the airline reported an underlying profit of £22.3m in the 12 months to the end of March, 
up from £7.4m. Earnings per share fell from 42p to 6p, while revenues rose 4.4 per cent to £595.5m.
Flybe will impose a fuel surcharge of £3 per passenger from September 1 to cope with rising fuel costs, which have 
spiked by more than 40 per cent since the end of last year.
Passenger numbers were steady at 7.2m, but Flybe's load factor - which measures how full aircraft are when they 
fly - slipped 1.8 percentage points to 61.7 per cent.
COMMENT
The timing of the IPO could not have come at a worse time - just ahead of a big jump in fuel prices that hit all 
airlines hard. The key to unlocking the growth potential of the stock is evidence from Flybe's experienced 
management team that it can find the right deals in continental Europe to drive growth. Flybe has no listed peer 
group and it is a stretch to compare it to Ryanair and EasyJet. Even so a forward PE ratio of just over 7 looks harsh, 
based on expected earnings of 25p per share for the current year, when the two low-cost airlines are on multiples in 
the low teens. The compelling growth story may have gone from the darlings of the low-cost sector but that does 
not mean Flybe should shrug off the full discount.

Travel companies, including the largest budget airline in Europe, have been told to stop hiding surcharges for 
customers who pay with debit cards.
The cost of processing debit cards is estimated to be 20p a transaction, but companies have been found to add up 
to £8 to final bills for payment by a debit card.
The Office of Fair Trading has warned that retailers that levy artificially high fees for card payments, or do not 
advertise fees charged, face action under consumer protection laws.
It has also recommended a change in the law to limit charges to the cost of processing card payments.
In an investigation of consumer charges in the travel industry, the watchdog found that a number of companies 
used a "drip pricing" method to add costs only at the very end of transactions.
Budget airlines including Ryanair were picked out as particular offenders.
Ryanair charges customers who buy flights with a debit card a £6 administration fee per passenger, per flight.
This means that a return flight booked in a single transaction on one card incurs a £12 fee.
Ryanair, which reported a 23 per cent rise in net profit in the year to the end of March, said the charge was not a 
debit card fee but rather an "optional" administration fee.
OFT warns retailers on debit card charges
Customers can avoid the charge if they have a prepaid MasterCard, which come with its own charges, including a 
set-up fee and monthly service charge.
As part of its "super complaint" into card charges in the travel industry, which preceded the OFT's investigation, 
consumer group Which? found that 16 airlines charged customers for using debit cards, including Ryanair, EasyJet, 
BMI Baby and Flybe.
Consumers in the UK are estimated to have spent £300m on surcharges in 2009 when buying travel tickets.
Following the publication of its findings the OFT said some companies had agreed to remove debit card charges, 
but travel analysts said they expected others to resist the change.
"If the card surcharge is banned the companies will seek to make up this lost revenue," said Bob Atkinson, travel 
analyst at Money­supermarket.com. "This could mean higher fees for credit card use or baggage allowances later 
on."
Monarch Airlines removed its 3.5 per cent debit card charge in June. The airline claimed it had not raised costs 
elsewhere but expected to benefit from better customer relations.
City lawyers said it was unlikely that consumers would see an end to debit card surcharges, but expected the OFT 
to enforce clarity in price advertising for travel companies.
The UK Cards Association, which represents credit and debit card providers, has supported the OFT investigation 
and agreed that some companies were imposing inflated surcharges beyond the actual card processing cost.

Budget airlines have been told to stop charging customers who pay using debit cards.
The Office of Fair Trading has warned that retailers that charge artificially high fees for card payments, or do not 
advertise fees charged, face action under consumer protection laws.
It is also asking the government to change the law to prohibit surcharges for payment by debit cards.
The watchdog has been investigating the practise of add-on surcharges  and has found that a number of 
companies use a "drip pricing" method to add costs to the price of a ticket only after a customer has almost 
completed the purchase.
It estimates that consumers in the UK spent £300m in 2009 on surcharges when buying travel tickets.
Monarch Airlines has already dropped debit card charges and the OFT said a number of other companies had 
agreed to remove them. Analysts, however, said they expected other companies to resist the change or seek to 
raise prices elsewhere.
"If the card surcharge is banned, the companies will seek to make up this lost revenue," said Bob Atkinson, travel 
analyst at moneysupermarket.com. "This could mean higher fees for credit card use or baggage allowances later 
on."
The OFT's investigation follows a "super complaint" issued in March by consumer group Which? accusing a variety 
of firms of springing "excessive" debit and credit card charges on customers.
OFT warns retailers on debit card charges
Many retailers charge customers who pay using credit cards, claiming that they are simply passing on the fee levied 
by banks and card companies.
But a growing number, including estate agent Foxtons, broadband provider AOL and low cost airline Ryanair, have 
begun to charge for debit cards as well, leaving customers with virtually no option to pay without being charged.
Which? said that although card payments did cost companies, the charge for processing debit card payments was 
no more than 20p.
The UK Cards Association has supported the investigation and agreed that some companies were imposing inflated 
surcharges beyond the actual card processing cost.
Ryanair charges customers who buy flights with a debit card a £6 administration fee per passenger per flight.
This means that two adults taking return flights pay more than £20 in charges, even if the flights are booked on the 
same card in a single transaction.
Previously, customers could evade the charge by using the popular Visa Electron card. Ryanair however has since 
changed its free option to the little-used prepaid MasterCard.

Boeing executives tried to put on brave faces at the Paris Air Show this week after rival Airbus walked off with a 
record number of orders and commitments for new passenger jets.
The European aircraft maker's success was down almost entirely to its latest aircraft programme - the A320 Neo, 
an upgraded version of its best-selling A320 narrow-body aircraft.
Airbus booked 667 commitments in total for the re-engined aircraft, which will enter service in 2015, lifting its haul 
for the show to 730 aircraft, worth $72.2bn at list prices. In contrast, by Friday Boeing had announced deals for just 
68 of the 737, bringing its total to 111 jets, worth $17.1bn.
The success of the Neo - it has now secured more than 1,000 orders since its launch last year - has piled further 
pressure on Boeing to respond, with both incumbents admitting their duopoly is over as new entrants target the 
narrow-body market. Jim Albaugh, head of Boeing's commercial aircraft business based in Seattle, dismissed the 
Neo this week by arguing it was merely bringing the A320 up to the standard of the rival Boeing 737.
Tom Enders, his counterpart at Airbus, ridiculed the suggestion but the proof will come if Airbus manages to switch 
key Boeing customers to the Neo. The US group has said it will decide by early 2012 whether to upgrade the 737 
engine or build an all-new aircraft.
The threat from new entrants was hammered home on Tuesday when Ryanair, an exclusive Boeing 737 customer, 
signed a co-operation agreement with China's Comac to advise on the development of a larger version of the C919 
narrow-body, which should enter service in 2016.

AirAsia has a chief executive straight from central casting. In the great tradition of airline entrepreneurs, Tony 
Fernandes has a gift for self-promotion: see his Twittered bid for West Ham United, the London football club, or the 
purchase of Caterham Cars. He also gives good copy. This week his company signed an $18bn, 15-year deal with 
Airbus to supply 200 A320 Neos - the third largest order in the European company's history. "One and two are 
Emirates and Qatar," Mr Fernandes noted. "But they don't count because they have oil and stuff."
Not much else about the ten year-old company is conventional. Since floating in November 2004 the shares of the 
Kuala Lumpur-based low-cost carrier, Asia's largest by passenger volumes, has outperformed the global aviation 
sector by 129 per cent. The core short-haul business has soared. A handful of global rivals has kept pace with 
AirAsia's revenue growth over the past five years, but none has bettered its average 57 per cent annual increase in 
net income. And while some no-frills long-haul carriers (including Oasis, which flew from Hong Kong to London) 
have collapsed, AirAsia X, launched in 2007 and now flying 4 round trips weekly between Paris and Kuala Lumpur, 
has been a success. Last month even venerable Singapore Airlines announced plans to launch a cheap long-haul 
service; the previous chief executive had said it would never work.
The stock, up almost a third this year, is now worth more than the flag-carriers of each of its core markets of 
Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. Disappointment will surely come: in an industry with a long-run operating margin 
of just 2 per cent, it always does. But for now, as AirAsia puts together a fleet the size of Ryanair, Europe's biggest 
budget carrier, hang on.

O'Leary slams Boeing 737 'confusion'

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair and one of Boeing's biggest 737 customers, has said the US aerospace 
group appears "confused" over what to do with its best-selling narrow-body jet in response to the decision by Airbus 
to re-engine the rival A320.
The two aircraft makers' dominance of the 100-200 seat segment, the biggest part of the commercial jet market, is 
coming to an end with at least three companies from China, Canada and Russia set to introduce rival offerings in 
the next five years.
That threat was hammered home on Tuesday when Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, signed a co-
operation agreement with China's Comac. The deal will see the airline advise on the development of a 200-seat 
version of the company's C919 aircraft, a 147-seat passenger jet which is due to enter into service with Chinese 
airlines in 2016.
Speaking to the Financial Times after the ceremony in Paris, Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, Europe's 
largest low-cost airline, said Boeing's indecision would result in airlines holding off from ordering more 737s, until it 
has clarified its position, which it has said it will do by early next year.
"Boeing would seem to be confused. They seem to be in trouble about whether to re-engine the 737 or redesign it 
altogether. Until they have made up their mind, I think airlines will be reluctant to commit to the 737," he said.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would discuss an order for 200 aircraft with both Comac and Boeing and would buy 
Comac's bigger jet, which could be ready by 2018, if it beat Boeing's offering on operating costs. The move would 
O'Leary slams Boeing 737 'confusion'
end Boeing's exclusive supply relationship with Ryanair, which operates one of the largest fleets of 737s in the 
world, with more than 300 aircraft.
"If Comac can get the costs right, then we will certainly place a big order with them," he said. "We are now 
committed to Comac in the same way we are committed to Boeing." After growing rapidly for the last 15 years, 
Ryanair is putting the brakes on its expansion. Mr O'Leary said it was likely to place an order in 2014 or 2015.
Boeing is coming under pressure from airlines to make a decision about whether to follow Airbus and put new 
engines on the 737 or go for the higher-risk, more costly approach of an all-new design.
Airbus's re-engined A320, dubbed the Neo, has proved a huge hit as it offers fuel savings of 15 per cent over the 
current model at a time when airlines are facing rising fuel costs.
The European aircraft maker announced deals for more than 100 A320 Neos at the Paris Air Show on Tuesday, 
bringing the total number of commitments to 594 since it was launched at the end of last year. The aircraft is due to 
enter service in October 2015.
Jim Albaugh, head of Boeing's commercial aircraft unit, said he was taking the challenge of the new entrants "very 
seriously" but dismissed the threat from the A320 Neo to the current generation of 737s, saying the two were now 
"on par".
Tom Enders, Airbus chief executive, who described Mr Albaugh's claim as "a joke" was backed by Mr O'Leary, who 
urged Boeing to go for a new aircraft. "I don't think re-engining is sufficient response to the Neo programme."
He said Ryanair would look to buy both Comac jets and an all-new Boeing aircraft to encourage competition 
between the two companies.
Forecasts see demand for close to 25,000 new jets in the 100-200 seat range, equal to 70 per cent of jet deliveries 
and worth $2,000bn, over the next two decades.

All was well when the invitation arrived until I noticed the two dreaded words at the bottom: business casual. With 
the possible exception of "tickets courtesy of Ryanair", I can think of no more depressing phrase in an invitation to 
any work event. Instead of just grabbing a suit, I was going to have to think about my ensemble. Are chinos too 
casual? Grey flannels too business? Suddenly a routine conference assumed the terrors of a red carpet: "OMG: 
Robert chooses chinos, so last season and a bit of a nightmare with those shoes." Or alternatively: "Oh no Shawna, 
here's someone in a lounge suit. You can always spot the first-timers."
Business casual is meant to indicate a relaxed, informal atmosphere; a forum conducive to ideas and conversation. 
But of course it is just as much of a uniform as anything else, and how you can you relax if you are the only one not 
wearing it?
To make matters even more complicated, the conference was in France and President Sarkozy was the opening 
speaker. Not that he'd be there by the time my workshop session got under way, but you couldn't help feeling he'd 
set the sartorial tone. Just to add to the calculations, this was a conference on the internet, meaning many of those 
present never wear suits, so there was a danger of looking seriously square (as if that isn't a danger most of the 
time in any case).
Ordinarily business casual for guys seems fairly clear. It is a pair of chinos, a blazer and a good shirt, no tie. But I 
was still uneasy. So I turned to Wikipedia. It offered little practical extra help beyond noting that "the second-from-
the-top shirt button may also be opened in addition to the very top button." Even this fairly useless advice carried 
the rider "citation needed", as if to stress that the second button debate is still very much a live one.
Why business casual makes me smart
I consulted a colleague who had worked in Paris on how he would interpret business casual. "Your best suit, a good 
shirt and possibly no tie," he replied without hesitation.
So I bottled it and wore a suit, which turned out to be the right decision because pretty much everyone else had 
done the same. Clearly the netizens were similarly intimidated by the gold-embossed invite as many of them were 
suits too. Mark Zuckerberg stuck to his guns and wore a T-shirt, but that's the kind of confidence that comes with a 
valuation in the billions.
Things got worse. Later there was to be a grand dinner for which the dress code was smart casual. It was clear by 
now that they were just toying with us. I turned again to Wikipedia. It advised that "smart casual" (as distinct from 
business casual) is "a loosely defined dress code, casual, yet 'smart' (ie 'neat') enough to conform to the particular 
standards of certain Western social groups". Or to put it another way: "You're on your own, pal."
A friend's wife acidly observes that "smart casual" means smart for the women and casual for the men. What is true 
is that if all these opaque dress codes are difficult for men, they must be torture for women. Dress or trousers? 
Fitted or flared skirt? Patterned or plain? Bare arms or covered? Is visible cleavage appropriate? This is tough. 
However stressful these dress codes are for men, at least we don't have to spend time in front of the mirror fretting 
over the right amount of lunchbox to display in outline.
At the other end of the spectrum is black tie; now seemingly the preserve of awards dinners and the annual 
company knees-up. For those who dislike this garb but who know it is rude to refuse to abide by the dress code, 
this is something of a blessing. For it means the words "black tie" on any work-related invitation signify an 
inessential event, something that can be missed unless you've a penchant for overcooked chicken. It may be good 
for networking but if there was any real work going on, an ordinary suit would be fine.
Business casual is not liberating but oppressive. Surely it should either be work clothes or casual? In between is 
hopeless. Anything else is a failure to understand the purpose of work clothes, which are not to stand out, but to fit 
in. Freedom at work is a nicely tailored suit, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

WorldSpreads, the Dublin-based spread betting company, has named Charlie McCreevy, the former EU 
Commissioner and Irish finance minister, as a non-executive director with immediate effect.
The eurozone heavy hitter will take an active part in the group's growth on the continent and develop new 
partnerships with banks, stockbrokers and other financial third parties, said Conor Foley, chief executive.
Mr McCreevy was previously EU commissioner for internal market and services before his retirement last year. He 
served as Irish minister for finance from 1997, when he steered Ireland's entry into the euro. He was also Ireland's 
minister for social welfare, tourism and trade and holds non-executive director positions at Sports Direct 
International and Ryanair in addition to his role as director of Dublin-based BNY Mellon Clearing, a subsidiary of the 
global banking group.
WorldSpreads has opened in Germany, France, Sweden and Denmark as part of its expansion plans. Handily, its 
array of instruments in stocks, bonds and foreign exchange lets investors take positions betting on likely defaults of 
rescued eurozone states, like, er, Ireland.

Family affair
The English Football Association may have found itself isolated at this week's summit of Fifa, the world's football 
governing body, in Zurich, but no matter.
Euro champion spreads the word
Amid controversy over the authorisation and ethics of the recent distribution of large quantities of cash in brown 
envelopes to some Fifa delegates in Trinidad, Fifa's president Sepp Blatter rode out the storm and was re-elected 
unopposed as the head of world football.
Amid all the hullabaloo, many may not have noticed that the summit also featured the presentation of Fifa's latest 
accounts to its congress by chairman of its finance committee, Argentine Julio Grondona. He declared at the 
summit that he would only vote for England to host the World Cup if it handed back the Falklands.
"Joking" aside, Mr Grondona commended the report covering four years of Fifa's commercial activities to delegates.
Fans of the beautiful game, concerned over the allegations of cash payments used to secure favour from Fifa 
delegates, can at least rest assured that the body's internal financial affairs are in order. KPMG's internal audit 
experts Fredy Luthiger and Alex Fähndrich signed off on Fifa's annual accounts in March, confirming that "an 
internal control system exists" and that the accounts complied with IFRS standards.
That's all right, then.
Oh, and Julio, if you get the Falklands, can we have our ball back, mister?

Kitchen drama
Gordon Ramsay Holdings made two important disposals last year, as confirmed by filings with Companies House 
this week: Murano, the west London restaurant he sold to protege Angela Hartnett in October, and Mr Ramsay's 
father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, who was fired from his chief executive role in November. The first move helped the 
company cut its debt by £3m ($5m) from the £7.25m it owed on August 31, its financial year-end.
The second, meanwhile, relieves the company of a man revealed in recent weeks to be something of a cad. It will 
mean "significant legal and professional costs" for the company this year. But it should help edge Ramsey's kitchen, 
if not closer to heaven, a bit further away from hell.
. . .
Ring of confidence
A year after NM Rothschild hired former Unilever finance director Jim Lawrence to lead its efforts in the US, the 
investment bank has hired ex-Colgate-Palmolive numbers man Stephen Patrick as a global senior adviser. Mr 
Patrick, who retired from Colgate in March after 28 years with the consumer group, will help bolster Rothschild's 
retail and consumer goods business, which the bank regards as a strength.
The bank advised on British American Tobacco's recent acquisition in Colombia and last month's £500m purchase 
of Jimmy Choo by Labelux, a Vienna-based private equity group.
Rothschild is also hoping to grow its business in the US on the back of demand for independent advice. The bank 
advised various US government agencies on the bankruptcy of General Motors.
During his time at Colgate, Mr Patrick held various positions in Europe, North America and Latin America.

Power Player: Rob Templeman, Debenhams CEO
Great speculation has surrounded what Rob Templeman, Debenhams' chief executive, might do following his 
staggered retirement from the department store group, writes Claer Barrett.
Euro champion spreads the word
It appears that chairing the industry body the British Retail Consortium will be the first - but not the last - of his new 
roles.
"I've had nearly 30 good years out of the retail sector, so it's time to give something back," said Mr Templeman on 
his appointment at the BRC, which he will take up on October 1. As non-executive chairman of Gala Coral, Mr 
Templeman is revered within the private equity industry, which is the direction where many suspected his post-
retirement career path would take.
"It's tough out there for retailers, and what the industry needs is everyone speaking with one voice, liaising with 
government on the key issues," he said, noting that 10 per cent of the UK's working population are employed within 
the retail sector.
Adding that the statesmanlike pro bono role would "not be a full-time job", he kept quiet about any other positions 
he has been offered.
Mr Templeman will work closely with BRC director-general Stephen Robertson, and takes over from outgoing 
chairman Luke Mayhew, former managing director of John Lewis.
He is married with three daughters, one of whom is studying fashion in London.

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, was his usual vociferous self in berating the authorities over the closure 
of airspace following the latest volcanic eruption last weekend.
"Bureaucratic incompetence," he said, had caused his airline and others to cancel a total of 900 flights across 
northern Europe in the first part of the week as regulators closed airspace affected by the ash cloud.
Similar, more subtle pressure from other airlines has led politicians and regulators to acknowledge that more work 
is needed to minimise disruption, even as Europe breathed a collective sigh of relief as the eruption eased, 
seemingly ending the threat of a return to the level of chaos seen during last year's ash cloud.
Yet Mr O'Leary's railing at the ash cloud and the enforced grounding of 66 Ryanair flights this week overshadowed 
what appears a seminal moment - the voluntary grounding of up to 80 aircraft this winter that will result in the first 
cut in capacity in the low-cost carrier's 26 years.
The overall cut in capacity - up to 5 per cent - may be relatively small but some analysts are already heralding it as 
more than symbolic in the context of the stellar growth course Mr O'Leary has put Ryanair on in his 17 years as 
chief executive.
Mr O'Leary, who has turned Ryanair into Europe's biggest short-haul airline by passenger numbers, says the cuts 
are a response to the high price of oil, which has jumped by more than 30 per cent since the start of the year, and 
the uncertain economic outlook.
Crowded skies test Ryanair model
But Chris Tarry, an analyst at Aviation Industry Research and Advisory, believes that Ryanair, like rival EasyJet, is 
for the first time facing the possibility that the European market is close to saturation.
"All markets mature and regional markets, which are where the low-cost carriers have been opening most of their 
new routes, mature very, very quickly indeed," Mr Tarry said.
Ryanair has typically expanded by 15-20 per cent a year, relying on the lowest costs in the industry to help it drive 
down fares and fill the seats by stimulating demand, as well as stealing market share from the legacy airlines. 
EasyJet was doing the same.
However, in recent years, there have been signs that both are changing tack. With little to trim from an already low 
cost base, the airlines are targeting top-line growth to push up margins. That means attracting business travellers 
prepared to pay higher fares and pushing up so-called ancillary revenues, from in-flight food and drinks sales to 
booking fees.
EasyJet already boasts that a fifth of its passengers travel on business but Ryanair is less forthcoming. However, 
recently it has started making changes designed to appeal to those travelling on business.
Ryanair has become known for flying passengers to out-of-the-way airports, avoiding congested, expensive main 
hubs. But there are signs of change. Last year it started flying into Barcelona's main El Prat airport and last month it 
broke with a key principle of the low-cost model by starting to take limited seat reservations on some routes.
Mr O'Leary laughed off suggestions that the winter capacity cuts signal saturation point. "No, not at all, not when we 
can fly all those aircraft again next April and fill them."
Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at RBS, agrees with Mr O'Leary, arguing the big low-cost carriers will continue to 
grow at the expense of rivals.
"There are arguments that suggest developed Europe has approached maturity but the major low-cost carriers can 
take market share from rivals and will continue to grow in less well developed markets."

There is a certain irony to the work economists do; they tend to judge where we are by looking at where we have 
just been. Economy Watch would compare this to being at sea; we don't know where we are, exactly, but we can 
measure how far we have travelled.
Officially data this week confirmed that we have not travelled much at all; the economy grew by just enough in the 
first quarter this year to cover the ground we lost at the end of last year.
More worrying was the revelation that households are every bit as badly off as the anecdotal evidence suggested. 
Household consumption fell even more sharply in the first quarter of this year than at the end of 2010 when 
spending might have been limited by bad weather.
Stretched households are not news to Ryanair which for the first time is set to ground more aircraft than it is buying 
due to the economic outlook and high fuel prices. And tough conditions in the high street mean that Marks and 
Spencer's chief executive is unlikely to receive his full bonus, even though sales there were better than at 
competitors.
While a closely watched survey of retailers found that sales in April were better than expected, they point to trouble 
ahead; unsold stock is at its highest level since 1984.
It turned out that the sector that contributed most to GDP growth was government, a source of demand that is 
unlikely to continue in light of cuts set for this financial year. Indeed, at first blush, it appeared government took in 
less and spent more than expected when official data were released, but these were distorted by comparisons with 
the year before, when a bank tax took effect.
Slow going for UK economy
Standing in the path of those cuts is the nation's construction sector, where 40 per cent of activity currently depends 
on government spending.  Willmott Dixon warned that those cuts will lead to three years of fierce competition, rising 
inflation and supply chain failures.
Also on the receiving end of the cuts are some elderly people. Local authorities are reducing the number they send 
to care homes, exacerbating the woes of Southern Cross, a leading provider who is also saddled with a big rental 
bill.
Perhaps even worse, it emerged that business investment fell sharply in the first quarter despite the fact that 
corporate coffers are stuffed with cash and industry surveys point to executives' intentions to step up investment 
activity.
The reason is unclear although one trade body, whose members are almost all manufacturers who export goods, 
has some ideas; when executives say they intend to invest, they may not mean in Britain. Increasingly, they want to 
site plants near customers.
Economy Watch ends the week wondering not where we are or even how far we have travelled. What would be 
more helpful is knowing where we are going.

Airports in northern Germany reopened on Wednesday afternoon after a high-density ash cloud from the Icelandic 
volcanic eruption, which had forced them to suspend flights earlier, began to dissipate.
Airlines resumed operations at Bremen, Hamburg and Berlin's two airports after German authorities lifted 
restrictions on flying.
Flights out of the UK returned to normal after about 500 services were cancelled on Tuesday, mainly in and out of 
Scotland, following a warning from the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, run by the UK's Meteorological Office, that a 
high-density ash cloud was over northern parts of the UK.
In further good news for passengers and the aviation industry, the eruption of the Grímsvötn volcano, which started 
over the weekend, appeared to have stopped early on Wednesday morning.
Ministers and officials were sounding increasingly optimistic that Europe would avoid the same level of chaos seen 
last year when another volcanic eruption in Iceland closed large swathes of airspace across the continent for up to 
six days.
The limited impact was also attributed to new European guidelines put in place after last year's eruption, which give 
airlines a much greater say about whether to fly when ash is forecast.
Many European regulators allow airlines to fly if they can demonstrate their fleets can handle certain levels of ash 
density. Most major airlines have already made the case for operating safely within medium-density ash clouds - 
where there is between 2g and 4g of ash per 10 cubic metres of air. The clouds that shut Scottish airspace on 
German airports reopen as ash cloud lifts
Tuesday and other parts of European airspace on Wednesday were deemed high-density with concentrations of 4g 
or higher.
No European airlines have yet made a safety case for operating in high-density conditions, although Ireland-based 
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, and British Airways, now part of International Airlines Group, are talking 
to their respective regulators about flying in areas deemed high ash, or red, zones.
Ryanair has led the criticism to the latest airspace closures, with Michael O'Leary, chief executive, calling the 
decision to stop aircraft operating over Scotland on Tuesday "bureaucratic nonsense".
Ryanair challenged the ban by operating an empty "verification" flight over Scotland on Tuesday, claiming it had not 
encountered any ash. The UK Civil Aviation Authority dismissed the claims, saying the aircraft had not flown near 
any high concentrations of ash.
British Airways operated a flight later on Tuesday into the red zone over Scotland in conjunction with the CAA, 
which similarly failed to encounter any ash. BA is calling on UK authorities to use multiple sources of data when 
analysing ash densities. The CAA said it had "total faith in the Met Office model".
Philip Hammond, UK transport minister, was meeting CAA and Met Office officials, alongside Willie Walsh, chief 
executive of International Airlines Group, which owns BA, and Carolyn McCall, chief executive of EasyJet, on 
Wednesday afternoon to discuss a number of measures to try to ensure fewer cancellations in high-level ash 
conditions.
Officials are concerned about the latest Met Office forecast that a high-density ash cloud could cover almost the 
entire UK on Friday, just ahead of a busy weekend for airlines with schools breaking up for a week's holiday.
The longer-range forecast is uncertain, not least because it was based on the assumption that the volcano was 
continuing to erupt at the same rate as it had until this morning.
One UK government official said Mr Hammond would talk to all parties about looking at ways to "reduce the size of 
the red zone as much as possible" using more detailed three-dimensional modelling of the ash cloud. These 
measures will include looking at flying within the red zone at altitudes where no ash is expected.
Friday's high-density cloud is forecast at between 35,000 and 55,000 feet - the normal cruising altitudes for many 
commercial flights. Officials are hoping to put in place measures that allow aircraft to continue flying in the 
designated red zones, but below those altitude levels.
The UK has come under criticism from Iata, the airline trade body, for not having a research aircraft ready to take 
samples of the ash cloud, which could help to improve modelling and forecasting. The Met Office is buying a new 
aircraft, which is not expected to be ready before July, and is looking to lease one temporarily.
Geologists have warned that Europe should brace itself for more eruptions as Iceland's volcanoes, the most active 
in the region, look set to be entering a more active phase. "It does seem we are entering a period of more 
eruptions," said Dr Andy Hooper, an expert on Iceland's volcanoes at Delft University of Technology in the 
Netherlands. He said the volcanoes under the country's largest ice cap have a cycle of about 140 years.
"There are up to three eruptions per decade producing significant ash in active times and less than one in periods 
of low activity. In fact, between 1940 and 1980 there were no such eruptions from these volcanoes, and there have 
now been four within 15 years."

Two German airports halted flights on Wednesday as the ash cloud from the volcanic eruption in Iceland drifted 
across northern Europe.
Hamburg and Bremen airports cancelled take-offs and landings, and German authorities said Berlin terminals could 
also face closure from 1000 GMT.
The Hamburg airport website said: "Currently there is no forecast when the restriction will be lifted". Lufthansa 
advised passengers that tickets for cancelled flights within Germany could be exchanged for rail vouchers.
On Tuesday the ash cloud forced the cancellation of about 500 flights to and from Scotland and some other parts of 
northern Europe but officials remained hopeful of avoiding similar chaos to that caused by an ash cloud last year.
Eurocontrol, the European air traffic agency, said the majority of cancellations  came after airspace was closed 
because ash was detected at high enough levels potentially to damage aircraft.
The number of flights affected was about 10 per cent of the total number that used UK airspace on Tuesday. 
Eurocontrol said its 39 member states on average handled just fewer than 30,000 flights daily.
Airlines including British Airways, EasyJet, KLM and Ryanair were forced to cancel flights to and from Edinburgh, 
Glasgow and Aberdeen, affecting thousands of passengers.
Siim Kallas, Europe's transport commissioner said on Tuesday: "We do not at this point anticipate a widespread 
airspace closure,".

Mr Kallas said the bloc had learnt from the calamity that followed last year's Icelandic eruption, in which outdated 
procedures and computer models led to a blanket closure of airspace across the continent - even in areas where 
little ash was present.
Europe, he said, was now equipped to take a "gradual response rather than a one-size-fits-all approach".
Philip Hammond, UK transport secretary, said services "should be returning to normal" on Wednesday morning.
A forecast by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, run by the UK's Met Office, showed that the high-density ash cloud 
was moving further east towards Denmark, Norway and Sweden and could spread to parts of northern Germany 
and the Netherlands on Wednesday.
The Met Office said its forecasts for the rest of the week showed only low-density ash clouds, in which most aircraft 
are cleared to operate, would affect parts of Europe but cautioned that forecasts beyond 24 hours were made with 
"no certainty".
Data from the Grímsvötn volcano also suggested that the eruption was diminishing.
New European guidelines, introduced after last year's ash cloud closed large parts of European airspace for five 
days, have made officials hopeful of avoiding a repeat of the chaos.
The decision on whether to fly in certain ash cloud conditions is left to individual airlines.
But there was also some criticism from the industry at the response to the ash cloud. Ryanair, Europe's largest low-
cost airline, openly challenged the ban on flights in and out of Scotland by operating what it called a "verification 
flight", claiming it had not encountered any ash.
Its claims were dismissed by the Civil Aviation Authority, which said the aircraft had been tracked on radar and it 
had not flown near the high concentrations of ash.
Iata, the airline trade body, also criticised the government for not having its test aircraft ready to monitor the ash 
cloud. One government official admitted the aircraft was grounded but said it had access to a wide range of data 
from satellites, weather balloons, radars and lasers to check for ash concentrations.
There was confusion about the application of the new rules allowing airlines to operate in medium-density ash by 
some European countries.
Germany appears to have broken ranks with the UK, France, Ireland, Norway and the Netherlands by insisting that 
its airlines must have their safety cases signed off by engine manufacturers, rather than approved by the safety 
regulator.

Flights at UK airports were returning to normal on Wednesday after the ash cloud from the Icelandic volcanic 
eruption cleared UK skies, although some airlines, including British Airways, had to axe some German services.
There were also concerns that high ash densities could return to the UK on Friday as the bank holiday getaway 
begins, but a UK Met Office official said the Grímsvötn volcano had stopped erupting.
Nats, the UK air traffic control company, said UK skies would be clear of high levels of ash until at least 7pm today.
Hamburg and Bremen airports cancelled flights, and German authorities said Berlin terminals could also face 
closure from 1000 GMT as the cloud drifted across northern Europe.

Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, said on Tuesday that it "strongly objected" to advice from Irish authorities 
not to operate flights to Scotland as many other airlines chose to suspend their Scottish services because of the 
threat from volcanic ash.
As the carrier sought a meeting with the Irish Aviation Authority to have the restriction lifted, the company said the 
cancellation of flights into or out of Glasgow Prestwick, Edinburgh or Aberdeen until at least the early afternoon was 
"unnecessary".
A statement on the Dublin-based carrier's website said: "Ryanair ... believe that there is no basis for these flight

removed as a matter of urgency."
It continued: "Ryanair believe that there is no safety risk to aircraft on fights operating to and from Scotland and 
together with other airlines will be complaining to the transport minister and regulatory authorities about these latest

Modelling by the UK's Meteorological Office, responsible for Europe-wide tracking of this week's volcanic eruptions 
in Iceland, showed the ash cloud would cover most of Scotland at sufficiently high densities to stop aircraft flying at 
altitudes up to 20,000ft by this morning. A lower-density plume could reach the Irish Republic, Northern Ireland, and 
northern England at about the same time, it said.
British Airways, KLM, Aer Lingus and EasyJet all suspended services into and out of Scotland on Tuesday morning.

BA is not operating any flights between London and Scotland until 2pm, while KLM cancelled flights to and from 
Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Newcastle as well as flights from Durham Tees Valley Airport. EasyJet 
cancelled flights to and from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Aberdeen between 5am and 1pm.
Flybe said it had cancelled flights to and from Aberdeen and Inverness. BMI flights to and from Aberdeen were 
subject to delay and the carrier said passengers should check its website. But services were running normally in

disruption.

to plan using weather forecasts no more than six hours in advance.

Ryanair said on Tuesday it strongly objected to Irish authorities' advice not to operate flights to Scotland as many 
other airlines chose to suspend their Scottish services because of the threat from volcanic ash.
As Europe's largest low-cost airline sought a meeting with the Irish Aviation Authority to have the restriction lifted, 
the company said the cancellation of flights into or out of Glasgow Prestwick, Edinburgh or Aberdeen until at least 
the early afternoon was unnecessary.
A statement on the Dublin-based carrier's website said: "Ryanair ... believe that there is no basis for these flight 
cancellations and will be meeting with the IAA on Tuesday morning to have this restriction on Ryanair flights 
removed as a matter of urgency.
"Ryanair believe that there is no safety risk to aircraft on fights operating to and from Scotland and together with 
other airlines will be complaining to the transport minister and regulatory authorities about these latest and 
unnecessary cancellations."
The Met Office said the ash had reached northern Scotland overnight and would spread to Wales, northern England 
and Northern Ireland by noon and across much of the UK by the end of the day.
However, forecasters said changing wind patterns made it hard to predict its exact path and concentrations would 
vary between regions. Southern England would see only low-density ash cloud, according to forecasts. Travellers 
were urged to check with their airlines before going to the airport.

Nats, the air traffic control service, said services could be affected later at some airports in northern England, 
including Newcastle, Carlisle, Durham Tees Valley and Cumbernauld.
This year, in Europe, the decision on whether to fly in ash cloud conditions is down to individual airlines, although 
they have to apply to the relevant regulator - the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in the UK - for final approval. There 
are three categories of ash density: low, medium and high. Permission has to be sought to fly in conditions of 
medium density upwards.
Lilian Cassin, an IAA official, said: "We received a safety case from from Ryanair at 4pm yesterday. There wasn't 
enough information and it was not up to standard."
She said a revised case was submitted at 9pm on Monday, which was "still being considered" adding: "There's lots 
of detailed technical data to be considered and our overriding criteria is safety".
British Airways, KLM, Aer Lingus and EasyJet all suspended services to and from Scotland on Tuesday morning.
BA is not operating any flights between London and Scotland until 2pm, while KLM cancelled flights to and from 
Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Newcastle as well as flights from Durham Tees Valley Airport. EasyJet

Airlines across Europe are braced for disruption this week as plumes of ash from Iceland's most active volcano 
moved towards UK airspace and led to flights on Tuesday being cancelled.
The Civil Aviation Authority, the UK air safety regulator, said it hoped fresh Europe-wide measures - introduced 
after last year's eruption of another Icelandic volcano led to widespread airspace closures - would minimise 
disruption.
But as some of the biggest operators serving Scotland - including British Airways and KLM - cancelled flights in and 
out of the region this morning, the CAA warned that more widespread disruption was possible later in the week. It 
said airlines tended to plan using weather forecasts no more than six hours in advance.
Loganair, a small regional carrier that operates flights in and out of Scotland, was the first to cancel flights, with a 
grounding of almost all aircraft on Tuesday.
President Barack Obama, on a visit to Ireland, brought forward his onward flight to the UK to Monday evening to 
beat any effects from the ash.
Modelling by the UK's Meteorological Office, responsible for Europe-wide tracking of volcanic eruptions in Iceland, 
showed the ash cloud would cover most of Scotland at sufficiently high densities to stop aircraft flying at altitudes up 
to 20,000ft by this morning. A lower-density plume could reach the Irish republic, Northern Ireland, and northern 
England at about the same time, it said.
Most modern aircraft cruise above 20,000ft but pass through the lower levels at takeoff and landing.
Europe on alert over ash cloud
Eurocontrol set up a crisis team after poor co-ordination was said to have exacerbated last year's crisis. It said that, 
"due to unstable meteorological conditions", it was impossible to identify for certain movements of the ash cloud 
more than 24 hours in advance.
European transport ministers played down fears of widespread disruption, after last year's eruption of

The ash cloud from the volcanic eruption in Iceland forced the cancellation of about 500 flights in and out of 
Scotland and some other parts of northern Europe on Tuesday but officials remained hopeful of avoiding similar 
chaos to that caused by an ash cloud last year.
Eurocontrol, the European air traffic agency, said the majority of cancellations  came after airspace was closed 
because ash was detected at high enough levels to potentially damage aircraft.
The number of flights affected was about 10 per cent of the total number that used UK airspace on Tuesday. 
Eurocontrol said its 39 member states on average handled just fewer than 30,000 flights daily.
Airlines including British Airways, EasyJet, KLM and Ryanair were forced to cancel flights in and out of Edinburgh, 
Glasgow and Aberdeen, affecting thousands of passengers.
"We do not at this point anticipate a widespread airspace closure," said Siim Kallas, Europe's transport 
commissioner.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
Mr Kallas said the bloc had learnt from the calamity that followed last year's Icelandic eruption, in which outdated 
procedures and computer models led to a blanket closure of airspace across the continent - even in areas where 
little ash was present. Europe, he said, was now equipped to take a "gradual response rather than a one-size-fits-all 
approach".
Hundreds of flights cancelled in ash cloud alert
Philip Hammond, transport secretary, said services "should be returning to normal" on Wednesday morning.
A forecast by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, run by the UK's Met Office, showed that the high-density ash cloud 
was moving further east towards Denmark, Norway and Sweden and could spread to parts of northern Germany 
and the Netherlands on Wednesday.
The Met Office said its forecasts for the rest of the week showed only low-density ash clouds, in which most aircraft 
are cleared to operate, would affect parts of Europe but cautioned that forecasts beyond 24 hours were made with 
"no certainty".
Data from the Grimsvotn volcano also suggested that the eruption was diminishing.
New European guidelines, introduced after last year's ash cloud closed large parts of European airspace for five 
days, have made officials hopeful of avoiding a repeat of the chaos.
The decision on whether to fly in certain ash cloud conditions is left to individual airlines.
But there was also some criticism from the industry at the response to the ash cloud. Ryanair, Europe's largest low-
cost airline, openly challenged the ban on flights in and out of Scotland by operating what it called a "verification 
flight", claiming it had not encountered any ash.
Its claims were dismissed by the Civil Aviation Authority, which said the aircraft had been tracked on radar and it 
had not flown near the high concentrations of ash.
Iata, the airline trade body, also criticised the government for not having its test aircraft ready to monitor the ash 
cloud. One government official admitted the aircraft was grounded but said it had access to a wide range of data 
from satellites, weather balloons, radars and lasers to check for ash concentrations.
There was confusion about the application of the new rules allowing airlines to operate in medium-density ash by 
some European countries. Germany appears to have broken ranks with the UK, France, Ireland, Norway and the 
Netherlands by insisting that its airlines must have their safety cases signed off by engine manufacturers, rather 
than approved by the safety regulator.

Hundreds of passengers faced travel delays on Tuesday as Iceland's volcanic ash cloud took its toll on airports in 
Norway, Denmark and Scotland.
Flights to and from Glasgow were among the first to be cancelled as the ash cloud drifted towards the UK.
Loganair, a small regional carrier that operates flights in and out of Scotland, decided on Monday to ground almost 
all its aircraft on Tuesday.
Irish carrier Aer Lingus said it had cancelled 12 flights to and from Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh.
British Airways announced that it would not operate any flights between London and Scotland before 2pm. EasyJet 
also cancelled its flights from Glasgow until lunchtime.
Norwegian airport operator Avinor said the ash from the Grímsvötn volcano had disrupted traffic to and from 
Stavanger and Karmoey airports and is expected to spread to southern Norway later on Tuesday.
Danish authorities said they had closed the airspace below 4 miles (6km) in north-western Denmark. There is no 
airport in that area, but the ash is causing delays and some cancellations at Copenhagen airport.
Airlines across Europe have been braced for disruption after plumes of ash from Iceland's most active volcano 
move southwards.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
The latest volcanic eruption in Iceland has caused a number of flight cancellations and there is a threat of further 
travel chaos if the ash cloud spreads in the UK.
The extent of the disruption is still unknown and is dependent on the weather. But airports curently affected include 
Londonderry, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Prestwick, Durham Tees Valley, Newcastle and Carlisle.
Here, we look at the rights of passengers who may be forced to cancel holidays.
Which airlines have announced cancellations?
British Airways said they will not operate any flights to and from Glasgow, Edinburgh and Newcastle on Tuesday.
Easyjet cancelled flights to and from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, Aberdeen and Newcastle until 7pm on 
Tuesday evening.
Ryanair cancelled all flights to and from Scotland for the rest of Tuesday
Other airlines to announce cancellations to Scotland and parts of the UK include KLM, Aer Lingus, Flybe, BMI and 
Loganair.
How long is this travel chaos expected to last?
Q&A: Volcanic ash and travel insurance
That depends very much on the ash cloud itself and the situation is changing minute-by-minute. Airlines are having 
to clarify the situation day by day.
Can I claim on my travel insurance?
Not necessarily. Financial research company Defaqto is warning holidaymakers that the ash cloud-related 
disruption could be treated differently by separate travel insurers.
The independent research firm advised people to ensure the policy they currently have in place considers the cloud 
to be an event related to the weather.
If their insurance provider does not specifically exclude natural events from deals, members of the public have been 
urged to find out the level of protection they are offered.
Statistics acquired by Defaqto revealed that nine per cent of insurers do not provide cover for expenses people may 
use during their time at the airport if their flight is delayed.
Mike Powell, the company's insight analyst for general insurance, said: "If holidaymakers are unsure, it is worth 
speaking to their insurance provider to get clarity on how they would treat any claims relating to the effects of the 
ash cloud."
Some travel insurance policies will pay out if a holiday, with its associated costs such as hotels, is cancelled owing 
to the flight problems. However, this depends on the small print so it is worth looking at your policy.
Previous eruptions caused some providers to offer insurance policies that specifically protected against ash cloud 
disruption.
Can I claim if my flight is delayed rather than cancelled?
If this happens you could be entitled to claim for meal and drinks. If the delay goes beyond 12 hours your travel 
insurance should offer some form of payout.
What if my flight is part of a package deal?
Package holidays have their own protection. Operators must refund customers for the whole holiday if trips are 
cancelled, meaning they could not get to their destination.
In reality, operators tend to give three options to people on package deals. They are: deferring the leaving date of 
the holiday, transferring to another holiday of the same or similar value, or a refund of the amount paid for the whole 
holiday.
There is also the potential claim to your credit card provider if you booked using your card.
What if I booked a car and hotel separately?
Travellers won't get a payout from the airline if they have to cancel transport or accommodation. In the first instance 
you should contact the hotel or car hire company and see if you can change your plans or arrange a refund. If this 
does not yield results, contact your travel insurer.
Which insurers will pay up?
The best thing to do is contact your insurer and ask them directly because each company will differ in the cover it 
offers.
A few of the companies to offer cover include HSBC and First Direct which offer airspace closure cover on all 
existing travel insurance policies which means customers can claim if they have to cancel their trip or are forced to 
remain abroad due to the closure of airspace for more than 24 hours.
Q&A: Volcanic ash and travel insurance
Saga also provides cover within its standard policy for irrecoverable costs as a result of disruption or cancellation 
caused by Volcanic Ash.

Ryanair will cut capacity for the first time in its history in the upcoming weaker winter period amid concerns about 
the economic outlook and high fuel prices and said it expected to report flat earnings this year.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier by passenger numbers said it would temporarily stop flying 80 jets in the winter 
schedule, between November and April next year, up from 40 aircraft last winter, leaving it with a modest 4 per cent 
growth in capacity in its financial year to the end of March 2012.
The airline will take delivery of 25 new aircraft over the coming months, bringing its total fleet to 292, but will not put 
them into service until the next summer schedule, starting in April 2012. For the first time, the company will also 
ground up to 55 aircraft in its existing fleet to offset the high cost of fuel cutting capacity as much as 5 per cent in 
the fiscal fourth quarter.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the measure was necessary to "protect" the carrier's profitability and would 
likely lead to some redundancies among pilots, cabin crew and engineers.
"It's going to be tough even with higher fares to make the same amount of money again," he said, as the airline 
reported a 23 per cent rise in net profit to EUR374.6m ($525.2m) in the 12 months to the end of March, up from 
EUR305.3m in the same period a year earlier.
The earnings, which included an exceptional EUR26m hit from the cost of the disruption to air travel over Europe 
caused by the volcanic eruption in Iceland last year, were slightly ahead of expectations. Adjusted earnings per 
share rose 25 per cent to 27 cents (22 cents) as revenues rose 21 per cent to EUR3.63bn (EUR2.99bn).
Ryanair to cut capacity for first time
Ryanair's average fare rose 12 per cent to EUR39 as it carried 72.1m passengers, up 8 per cent.
The cautious outlook and concerns over the impact of the latest volcanic eruption over Iceland, which weighed on 
all airline shares, spooked investors, sending shares down 5 per cent to EUR3.37 in Dublin.
It said higher oil prices were expected to push operating costs up 13 per cent this financial year, while average 
fares would only rise 12 per cent, leaving full year profits to March 2012 flat year-on-year at around EUR400m.
Like all other airlines, Ryanair is facing growing pressure from rising fuel prices and the carrier expects its fuel bill to 
rise by EUR350m this year, after a jump of 37 per cent to EUR1.23bn in the last 12 months to the end of March. 
Ryanair has 90 per cent of its fuel requirements for this financial year hedged at an average of $82 per barrel.
Ryanair, which was founded in 1985, has grown rapidly over the last 15 years using large aircraft orders to lift 
capacity by 15 to 20 per cent a year. It said last year it would start slowing expansion, adding 8 per cent more 
seats.
Next year, Ryanair will take the last of the Boeing 737s it has on order and Mr O'Leary said he was not planning on 
placing any new orders until 2016 and would instead focus on optimising the network for profitability.
"After growing rapidly for 20 years I would like to take a year or two of no growth and take a look at which airports 
are not offering us good business terms," he said.

Ryanair is planning to double the number of aircraft it grounds in the weaker winter period amid concerns about the 
economic outlook and high fuel prices as it announced it expected to report flat earnings this year.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier by passenger numbers said it would temporarily stop flying 80 jets in the winter 
schedule, between November and April next year, up from 40 aircraft last winter, leaving with a modest 4 per cent 
growth in capacity in its financial year to the end of March 2012. At the end of March, the airline had a fleet of 272 
aircraft.
"Since we have limited visibility on bookings, we remain concerned at the impact of the recession, austerity 
measures and falling consumer confidence on fares," Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said in a statement.
The comments came as Ryanair reported a 23 per cent rise in net profit to EUR374.6m ($525.2|m) in the 12 
months to the end of March from EUR305.3m in the same period a year earlier.
The earnings, which included an EUR26m hit from the cost of the disruption to air travel over Europe caused by the 
volcanic eruption in Iceland last year, were slightly ahead of expectations but the cautious outlook spooked 
investors, sending the shares down 5 per cent to EUR3.36 in early morning trading in Dublin.
Adjusted earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 27 cents (22 cents) as revenues rose 21 per cent to EUR3.63bn 
(EUR2.99bn).
Like all other airlines, Ryanair is facing growing pressure from rising fuel prices and the carrier expects its fuel bill to 
rise by EUR350m this year, after a jump of 37 per cent to EUR1.23bn in the past 12 months to the end of March.
Ryanair to ground more aircraft due to high fuel costs
The carrier, which has 90 per cent of its fuel requirements for this financial year hedged at an average of $82 per 
barrel, said the high oil prices would likely see it report net income for the full year to March 2012 at the same level 
as this year - EUR400m excluding the cost of volcanic disruption.
It said higher oil prices were expected to push operating costs up 13 per cent this financial year, while average 
fares would only rise 12 per cent.

Ryanair plans to double the number of aircraft it grounds in the weaker winter period amid concerns about the 
economic outlook and high fuel prices as it announced it expected to report flat earnings this year.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier by passenger numbers said it would temporarily stop flying 80 jets in the winter 
schedule, between November and April next year, up from 40 last winter, leaving it with a modest 4 per cent growth 
in capacity in its financial year to the end of March 2012. At the end of March, the airline had a fleet of 272 aircraft.
"Since we have limited visibility on bookings, we remain concerned at the impact of the recession, austerity 
measures and falling consumer confidence on fares," Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said in a statement.
The comments came as Ryanair reported a 23 per cent rise in net profit to EUR374.6m ($525.2m) in the 12 months 
to the end of March from EUR305.3m in the same period a year earlier.
The earnings, which included an EUR26m hit from the cost of the disruption to air travel over Europe caused by the 
volcanic eruption in Iceland last year, were slightly ahead of expectations but the cautious outlook spooked 
investors, sending the shares down 5.3 per cent to EUR3.36 in morning trading in Dublin. EasyJet and IAG shares, 
meanwhile, were both down 3.6 per cent on fears of renewed ash cloud disruption from Iceland.
Adjusted earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 27 cents (22 cents) as revenues rose 21 per cent to EUR3.63bn 
(EUR2.99bn).
Like all other airlines, Ryanair is facing growing pressure from rising fuel prices and the carrier expects its fuel bill to 
rise by EUR350m this year, after a jump of 37 per cent to EUR1.23bn in the past 12 months to the end of March.

Airlines and airports across Europe were braced for possible disruption this week after plumes of ash from Iceland's 
most active volcano looked set to enter UK airspace by Tuesday.
The Civil Aviation Authority, the UK air safety regulator, said it hoped that new Europe-wide measures, introduced 
after the eruption from another Icelandic volcano last year led to  widespread airspace closure across the continent, 
would minimise any disruption.
William Hague, the UK foreign secretary, said he did not believe air traffic would suffer extensive disruption this 
time.
"We are better prepared and we'll have far better information and intelligence which allows us then to adjust things 
without necessarily the blanket bans on flights that we saw last year," he said during a visit to Brussels.
Transport ministers around Europe also played down fears of widespread disruption, after last year's eruption of the 
Eyjafjallajökull volcano stranded millions of passengers and cost airlines millions of pounds in compensation.
Scientist said the eruption of the Grimsvotn volcano over the weekend may have been larger than last year's 
eruption but that conditions were different.  "It is not likely to be anything on the scale that was produced last year 
when the Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted," Pall Einarsson, a geophysicist at the University of Iceland said.
"That was an unusual volcano, an unusual ash size distribution and unusual weather pattern, which all conspired 
together to make life difficult in Europe."
Airports braced for volcanic ash disruption
Nevertheless airline shares fell on the news, with Lufthansa, IAG, the parent of British Airways and Iberia, and Air 
France-KLM all down about 4 per cent. Shares in Europe's two largest low-cost airlines, Ryanair and Easyjet were 
down a similar amount.
Eurocontrol, Europe's air traffic control organisation, said particles from the Grimsvotn volcano, which started to 
erupt on Saturday, could reach Scotland by 1am on Tuesday and southern England by Thursday or Friday, 
depending on wind direction.
But scientists said the particles in this eruption were heavier than in the one last year, meaning fewer were making 
it into the upper atmosphere. There were also signs the intensity of the eruption was decreasing.
Iceland shut its main airport outside Reykjavik on Sunday and it remained closed on Monday but officials were 
hopeful it could re-open later in the day.
BAA, the owner of Heathrow, Stansted, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen airports, has convened a crisis support 
team to prepare for a reduction in flights, as airlines and airports await a further briefing from National Air Traffic 
Services. "We are working closely with the CAA and Nats in preparing contingency plans if ash enters UK 
airspace," it said.
Eurocontrol, which set up a crisis team after poor coordination was blamed for worsening last year's crisis, said no 
closures outside Iceland were expected on Monday or Tuesday. Any decisions for other countries on flying 
restrictions will depend on wind direction and whether aviation authorities think the ash is a danger to engines.
Last year, airspace had to be closed because of concerns that particles could get into aircraft engines and cause 
accidents. Some airlines, including Ryanair, complained that authorities had been excessively cautious in imposing 
blanket closures.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said he thought the new measures put in place would mitigate any 
impact from the ash cloud. "I think there will be a lot fewer problems this week.
New guidelines allow airlines to fly if they can demonstrate their fleets can handle certain levels of ash density. A 
CAA spokesman said most major airlines already made the case for operating safely within medium-density ash 
clouds.
Eurocontrol said in a statement: "There is currently no impact on European or transatlantic flights and the situation 
is expected to remain so for the next 24 hours. Aircraft operators are constantly being kept informed of the evolving 
situation."

British Airways  and KLM have cancelled flight to northern Britain in advance of plumes of ash from Iceland's most 
active volcano entering UK airspace by Tuesday
Airlines and airports across Europe had been braced for possible disruption this week after the erruption of the 
Grimsvotn volcano.
President Barack Obama, on a visit to Ireland, brought forward his onward  flight to the UK to Monday evening to 
beat any effects from the ash.
British Airways says it is canceling all Tuesday morning flights between London and Scotland because of forecasts 
of volcanic ash in Scottish airspace.
KLM said flights to and from Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Newcastle would be cancelled on Tuesday 
morning.
The Civil Aviation Authority, the UK air safety regulator, said late on Monday that only one airline had so far 
cancelled flights. It hoped that fresh Europe-wide measures - introduced after the eruption of another Icelandic 
volcano last year led to widespread airspace closu re - would minimise disruption.
Loganair, a small regional carrier that operates flights in and out of Scotland, became the first airline to cancel 
flights, with a grounding of almost all aircraft today.
Volcanic ash leads to BA and KLM cancellations
Modelling by the UK's Meteorological Office, responsible for Europe-wide tracking of volcanic eruptions in Iceland, 
showed the ash cloud would cover most of Scotland at sufficiently high densities to stop aircraft flying at altitudes up 
to 20,000ft by this morning. A lower-density ash plume could reach the Irish Republic, Northern Ireland, and some 
of northern England at about the same time, it said.
Most modern aircraft cruise above 20,000ft but would have to pass through the lower levels at takeoff and landing.
BA said on Monday that it was keeping the situation under review. The CAA said airlines tended to plan using 
weather forecasts no more than six hours in advance.
Eurocontrol set up a crisis team after poor co-ordination was said to have exacerbated last year's crisis. It said "due 
to unstable meteorological conditions", it was impossible to identify surely movements of the ash cloud more than 
24 hours in advance.
European transport ministers played down fears of widespread disruption, after last year's eruption of 
Eyjafjallajökull volcano stranded about 10m passengers and cost airlines an estimated $1.7bn in compensation. 
Airspace was closed last year over concerns that particles could damage jet engines, perhaps leading them to 
seize up. Some airlines, including Ryanair, complained that authorities were excessively cautious.
Michael O'Leary, Ryan­air's chief executive, said the new measures were likely to mitigate ash cloud effects. "There 
will be a lot fewer problems this week," he said.
In Brussels, European Commission officials were co-ordinating with flight controllers, airlines and airports across 
the continent to review the situation.
Scientists said the eruption of the Grímsvötn volcano at the weekend may have been larger than last year's 
eruption but conditions differed. "It is not likely to be anything on the scale that was produced last year," said Pall 
Einarsson, a geophysicist at the University of Iceland.

Italy's benchmark equity index fell to its lowest level in more than four months in the wake of Standard & Poor's 
lowering the credit outlook on the country.
The FTSE MIB index of Italian stocks slid 3.3 per cent to 20,532.64 after the rating agency cut its long-term credit 
outlook on the country from "stable" to "negative" over the weekend.
S&P's move was due to Italy's weak growth prospects and a rising risk that it may struggle to cut its debt pile.
Financial stocks were among the worst hit, with asset manager Mediolanum falling 2.8 per cent to EUR3.62 while 
banking group Intesa Sanpaolo lost 2.8 per cent to EUR1.69. UBI Banca slid 1.8 per cent to EUR5.22.
Carmaker Fiat fell 3.4 per cent to EUR6.73 after the company said it would bring forward some holidays at its Sevel 
plant, in part to account for component shortages due to interruptions in the supply chain caused by the March 
earthquake in Japan.
"Whether you think Italy is a relatively safe credit or not, they really don't have much margin for error if the market 
disagrees," said Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank.
Overall, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.7 per cent to 1,116.52 as the broad sell-off accounted for losses at all but 
about half a dozen of the pan-European index's components.
Stocks in Athens performed less badly than those in Milan as Greek markets recovered a little poise following 
Friday's debt downgrade by Fitch.
Italy leads sell-off after S&P cuts outlook
The Athens General index slipped 1.3 per cent to 1,280.10. George Papandreou began a cabinet meeting on 
further budget cuts and asset sales to try to convince international lenders that Athens can come through the crisis 
without the need to restructure its debt payments.
The country's banks remained under pressure, however, with Piraeus Bank down 1.9 per cent to EUR1.01, Bank of 
Cyprus off 2.8 per cent to EUR2.10 and National Bank of Greece down 3 per cent at EUR4.53.
Ryanair, the Irish airline, was among the biggest fallers on the Eurofirst 300 amid the latest volcanic ash cloud 
scare. Its stock fell 5.3 per cent to EUR3.36 after Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the airline was not focused 
on growth for the next couple of years as he intended to improve yields and cut costs.

European equities sank to their lowest in more than a month after Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, lowered its 
credit outlook on Italy.
The FTSE MIB index of Italian stocks slid 2.8 per cent to 20,655.76, its lowest point in four months, after S&P cut its 
long-term credit outlook on the country to "negative" from "stable", due to the country's weak growth prospects and 
rising risks it may struggle to cut its debt pile.
Among the biggest fallers on the MIB was carmaker Fiat. The company said it would bring forward some holidays at 
its Sevel plant, in part to account for component shortages due the March earthquake in Japan. Fiat shares lost 2.4 
per cent to EUR6.79.
Mediobanca, Italy's largest investment bank, fell 2 per cent to EUR7.37, while Generali, the insurer, lost 2.1 per 
cent to EUR14.81.
"Whether you think Italy is a relatively safe credit or not, they really don't have much margin for error if the market 
disagrees," said Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank.
Overall, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.1 per cent to 1,123.48, but it was not the severity of the losses that was 
striking, but breadth, with only half a dozen of the 300 stocks in positive territory.
Stocks in Athens performed less badly than those in Milan as Greek markets recovered a little poise following 
Friday's debt downgrade by Fitch. The Athens General index slipped 1.2 per cent to 1,281.63.

The country's banks remained under pressure, however, with Piraeus Bank down 3 per cent to EUR1, Bank of 
Cyprus off 1.9 per cent to EUR2.12 and National Bank of Greece down 1.7 per cent at EUR4.59.
Ryanair, the Irish airline, fell 4.5 per cent to EUR3.39 after chief executive Michael O' Leary said it would not focus 
on growth for the next couple of years as he instead intended to improve yields and cut costs.
Meanwhile, there were fears that a plume of volcanic ash from an Icelandic volcano could disrupt some air routes. 
Germany's Lufthansa fell 3.4 per cent to EUR15.04.

Budget airlines have looked down on their network carrier competitors for years. We actually make money most of 
the time, they crow (it does not take much to feel superior in a sector that routinely fails to cover its cost of capital). 
This year, though, higher oil prices should in theory erode their competitive advantage, since fuel accounts for a 
higher proportion of their costs. They also lack price-insensitive business travellers who can help pay for more 
expensive fuel.
Worried investors should not underestimate the budget airlines, though. Over the past five years, the oil price has 
risen 60 per cent, yet budget carriers have held total unit costs steady or even cut them, by pruning crew costs and 
getting cheap deals on planes. They also use their planes more efficiently. Europe's network carriers, which time 
their short-haul flights to feed long-haul routes, keep their planes in the air for 6 to 7 hours a day, according to 
Deutsche Bank. Ryanair and EasyJet keep their planes flying for 9 to 10 hours a day.
Even if budget airlines now struggle to shave off more costs, they should be able to increase revenue by taking 
market share from the network carriers. EasyJet and Ryanair are both moving to more mainstream airports; 
EasyJet is actively targeting business travellers. This strategy depends on decent execution, something EasyJet 
still needs to prove after a summer of operational mistakes. Ryanair's management, though, is second to none. And 
whether by luck or judgment, it has hedged 90 per cent of its fuel needs this year, compared with the European 
airline average of 60 per cent.
As the airlines report their first-quarter results this month, Ryanair's valuation (its lowest since the recession at 10 
times next year's expected earnings) looks too low. A good business model with good management can ride out all 
kinds of storms.

Boeing moots radical revamp of 737

Boeing is looking at a radical revamp of its venerable 737 aircraft, the world's most widely-flown commercial jet, 
including a plan for an all-new aircraft with a main body made of the plastic composites used in its ground-breaking 
787 Dreamliner.
Another option the US aircraft maker has been quietly outlining in presentations to its leading airline customers 
would see the single-aisle 737 that it first started making in the 1960s replaced with a twin-aisle aircraft.
The company is referring to this option, which would transform the way millions of people fly, as the "new light twin", 
say executives briefed on Boeing's plans. Jeff Smisek, chief executive of the newly merged United Continental 
group in the US, told the FT the idea was for a "highly fuel efficient" new jet seating at least 200 passengers.
The move comes as Boeing and its European rival, Airbus, face pressure from rival manufacturers to find cheaper, 
more fuel efficient replacements for their best-selling jets - the 737 and Airbus's younger A320 family of aircraft - 
which together make up almost half of all commercial jets in operation.
Airbus took the plunge in December, announcing it would put new engines on its A320 aircraft to shave fuel 
consumption by 15 per cent.
It has since won more than 300 commitments for these A320 NEO [new engine option] aircraft as fuel prices have 
soared amid Middle East unrest.
Boeing is still weighing its options, including a jet with a fuselage made of the plastic composites used in its much-
delayed 787 Dreamliner but wings made of traditional aluminium.
Boeing moots radical revamp of 737
Some industry sources say this is an acknowledgement of the lessons learnt from the production glitches Boeing 
faced with the 787, whose fuselage and wings are both made of composites.
Beverly Wyse, general manager of the 737 programme at Boeing's commercial aircraft division, told the FT the 
company was still some way away from a final decision on what she called "the new small airplane".
"If you did a twin-aisle, you can get turn-time benefits because you can load and offload passengers much more 
quickly," she said.
But widening the diameter of the jet's main body meant "you're going to give up something in terms of fuel 
efficiency, so it's really about figuring out where those trades are".
Plastic composites technology, she said, while "very powerful on the larger airplanes does not scale down as well" 
to smaller jets.
Howard Millar, finance director at Ryanair, one of the 737's largest customers, said he had reservations about the 
twin-aisle idea, which could also boost seating capacity from current levels of less than 200 passengers.
"Turnround times would be helped by a twin aisle," he said. "However, building a twin-aisle with a capability of up to 
250 seats means the aircraft will have to be pretty heavy, which affects fuel costs and airport charges driven by 
weight."
United's Mr Smisek said his airline had told Boeing it wanted to see another "game-changing" aircraft such as the 
lightweight 787. "In the world of $130-a-barrel jet fuel, it's a no-brainer, " he said in an interview.
Ms Wyse played down speculation Boeing would reveal its final plans for the 737 at the Paris air show in June, a 
traditional venue for big industry announcements.
"But we'll definitely give the market a strong indication of which way we're going," she said.

Ryanair is breaking with one of the key principles of the low-cost airline model by taking limited seat reservations on 
some routes.
The move will see Europe's largest low-cost airline by passenger numbers start a trial on two routes out of Dublin 
from mid-May to London Gatwick and Malaga. It will make 24 seats available - in the front two rows and the two 
rows with more leg room by the wings - on each 189-seat 737 aircraft which passengers can pre-book for an extra 
EUR10 each way.
The airline said it would look at rolling out pre-bookings "selectively" on other Ryanair routes depending on the 
outcome of the trial.
One analyst said the move was likely to be prompted by the need to offset the rising cost of fuel, with the price of a 
barrel of crude up around $120 from $96 at the start of the year.
Ryanair, which has traditionally produced one of the strongest profit performances in the industry, listed rising fuel 
costs as one of the main reasons for a EUR10.3m loss in the third quarter.
This month it introduced a EUR2 levy per passenger to cover costs of an EU requirement to reimburse passengers 
for flight cancellations and delays.
Rivals and analysts said that earlier move was a disguised fuel surcharge. Unlike most airlines, Ryanair insists it 
does not impose extra charges on passengers to offset high costs of fuel.
Ryanair to allow passengers to book seats
Ryanair is one of the best hedged airlines in the industry, with 80 per cent of its fuel needs covered at a price below 
$100 per barrel out till March next year. However, as it operates a much more efficient model than most airlines, its 
bottom line is more sensitive to rising oil prices. Fuel costs account for about 29 per cent of a traditional airline's 
operating expenses, against between 35 to 40 per cent for a low-cost airline.
The decision to trial the pre-booking of seats is a break with the low-cost airline model developed by Southwest 
Airlines, the US carrier. While the originator of the model still has an open-seating policy some copycat airlines, 
such as US rival JetBlue and Wizz Air, the Hungarian-based low-cost carrier, take seat reservations.
In a bid to keep the costs down, no-frills operators focus on maximising the amount of time their aircraft - by far the 
most expensive assets - are in the air.
The theory expounded by Southwest is that by refusing to take reservations, passengers will have to queue to get 
the best seats and will therefore be at the gate when the aircraft arrives. However, this can lead to problems on 
boarding the aircraft as passengers grab the first available seat and often hold up everyone else behind them.
In contrast, traditional carriers offering seat reservations often have to delay flights while they try to locate the last 
few passengers.
Some low-cost carriers, such as JetBlue, have decided to offer seat reservations to attract business travellers, who 
traditionally pay higher fares. Some low-cost airline executives argue that pre-allocated seating can lead to 
smoother boarding of passengers as long as they are all at the gate on time.
EasyJet, Ryanair's biggest low-cost rival, said on Tuesday it was "reviewing the issue of seat allocation" adding that 
it was assessing introducing the measure for all seats.

Airlines may no longer face open-ended obligations to feed and lodge stranded passengers after the European 
Commission acknowledged the industry's complaints and said it would revise a key piece of legislation.
Siim Kallas, Europe's transport commissioner, announced on Monday that he would examine ways to limit airlines' 
responsibility to care for stranded travellers as part of a broader revision of passenger rights legislation.
The issue of caring for stranded passengers moved to the top of the agenda during last year's volcanic ash crisis, in 
which governments grounded thousands of flights across Europe for safety reasons.
Under the EU's six-year-old passenger rights law, airlines are required to feed and house passengers in Europe 
until they can be rebooked on other flights. The law was passed to protect consumers amid suspicions that airlines 
were delaying or cancelling partially full flights in order to save money.
But the airlines complained that it was misapplied during the ash cloud crisis - forcing them to shoulder the burden 
for an unforeseen natural disaster that created a week-long public emergency.
They raised similar arguments in December after wintry weather and shortages of de-icing fluid also forced 
widespread flight cancellations.
Ryanair, which has been a strong critic of the EU's passenger right law, said any additional reform of the rules 
"must not impose further unreasonable costs to airlines since these will simply get passed on to passengers in the 
form of higher fares".
Airlines' duty to travellers faces curb
Ryanair last week introduced a EUR2 ($2.9) surcharge to offset the EUR100m in expenses it claims to have 
suffered during the past year related to the passenger rights law.
Stephen McNamara, of Ryanair, said at the time: "It is clearly unfair that airlines are obliged to provide meals and 
accommodation for passengers - for days and weeks in some cases - simply because governments close their 
airspace, or air traffic controllers walk off the job, or incompetent airports fail to clear their runways of snow."
In a review of the law published on Monday, Mr Kallas effectively agreed. He said that the commission would 
examine "limitation of liability" in exceptional circumstances and "compensation thresholds" when it proposes a 
revision to the law in 2012.
A commission official declined to comment on the specific remedies but acknowledged that policymakers had come 
to share the airlines' view that the legislation was never intended to cope with an extended closure of European 
skies.
A key issue to work out, this person said, was at what point the responsibility would pass from the airlines to 
governments.

Of all the words used to describe Michael O'Leary, the irascible boss of Ireland's Ryanair budget airline, one you 
don't hear too often is "fast". But by God he can be quick when he wants to be. Here at the Cheltenham races he is 
fairly pelting through the crowd to the owners' and trainers' enclosure, where one of the 50-odd racehorses he has 
acquired over the last decade, Mr Cracker, is getting ready for the first race of the day.
The pace is striking for a man of average build with a sedentary job a few days from his 50th birthday. It is as if he 
is being chased by a gang of livid Ryanair passengers, of which there rarely seems a shortage. In fact, only two 
people are puffing along behind him: an FT photographer and me. Eventually he stops to let us catch up. "You have 
to be quick," he says semi-apologetically. "Otherwise every gobshite is stopping you to ask, 'What tips have you got 
for us today?'"
At last we make it to the enclosure. No gobshites in here. Just a nervy throng of skittish horses, anxious trainers 
and watchful owners, chatting quietly as their jockeys head out on to one of Europe's most famous racetracks.
Cheltenham is not like Royal Ascot. As O'Leary likes to say, the crowd here doesn't quaff. It slugs. This is the 
mecca of national hunt or jump racing. And because it is dominated by Irish and British-trained horses, but set in 
the tweedy heart of England's Cotswolds, there is a cheerful undertone of Anglo-Hibernian rivalry. Especially when 
an Irish horse wins, as one is doing now up on the huge video screen O'Leary is watching.
Unfortunately for him, it isn't Mr Cracker. But it is Irish and today is St Patrick's day, and a huge cheer erupts from 
outside the enclosure. "If you can't enjoy this, you should never go racing," says O'Leary, gazing happily at a crowd 
dotted with the occasional man dressed as a leprechaun in green and orange tights. "This is as good as it gets."
Racing with the FT: Michael O'Leary
The Irish are on a huge roll. Their horses won six out of seven races the day before. Two were from O'Leary's 
Gigginstown House Stud, part of his estate near the town of Mullingar, an hour's drive west of Dublin. Mullingar is 
central to his attachment to horse racing. The maroon and white that his jockeys wear come from the county 
football team. He grew up on a farm there and his parents still live close by.
The morning's Racing Post reports that after one of O'Leary's wins the previous day, he tearfully paid tribute to his 
father, Ted, who used to own racehorses himself but is now being treated for cancer. "I wouldn't be here if he hadn't 
bred it into me," O'Leary said. He looks more cheerful today as he explains how his father "had a couple of good 
horses over the years", but none that made it to Cheltenham. O'Leary might not have either if it weren't for his 
brother, Eddie, a quieter, bulkier version of Michael, bustling around nearby.
O'Leary says the two of them, along with their three sisters and brother, were all packed off to riding school at the 
age of four. O'Leary fell off on about day two and decided that was enough. "I was bright. I realised I could get hurt 
doing this, so I stopped straight away." But Eddie was a "very good rider, did show jumping, all that kind of stuff", 
and now manages the Gigginstown operation. "He runs the stud, buys all the horses, does all that," says O'Leary. "I 
just write the cheques. We have an appropriate division of labour!"
O'Leary is worth millions thanks to his 3.7 per cent stake in Ryanair, which is just as well since one of his winners 
yesterday, First Lieutenant, cost EUR255,000, the most O'Leary says he has ever paid for a horse. It is barely a 
decade since O'Leary bought his first horse, Tuco, which won several races before getting killed in an Irish jumps 
race. "When he got killed we went out and bought another one that week to replace him," O'Leary says matter-of-
factly. The new horse was War of Attrition, which won the Cheltenham gold cup, the Wimbledon of jump racing, in 
2006.
O'Leary once said that "War", as the retired horse is now affectionately known, had given him the best days of his 
life, apart from the birth of his children. This got him into trouble at home, he says with a mock scowl. "My wife 
asked me, 'What about our wedding day?' I said, 'No, that was a bloody nightmare.' Wonderful result, just a pain in 
the arse of a day."
O'Leary can sound sweeter when he talks about his horses. "They're lovely animals," he says. "They're like 
humans: you can't tell which one is going to be a winner from looking at them. Flat racing is much more driven by 
pedigree, whereas with jump racing, almost every top jumps horse isn't related to anything."
They also bring him to a world far from the 24-7 mayhem of running a budget airline. Outside, O'Leary may be the 
voluble boss of Ryanair, forever threatening to charge fat passengers extra when he isn't trying to put coin locks on 
aircraft toilets. But here, he is the man. "Hello Michael!" people call. "Well done, Michael!" Everyone wants a chat. 
Trainers. Other owners. Racecourse bosses. Charlie McCreevy, Ireland's former finance minister (now a Ryanair 
board member).
O'Leary doesn't seem to be here to socialise, though: in the winner's enclosure a bit later, we are standing a short 
half head away from Princess Anne and Zara Phillips. O'Leary doesn't talk to either, not even when Princess Anne 
passes inches from his nose. "Isn't that Princess Anne?" I ask. "Ah yes, she's usually here," he says nonchalantly. 
Finally, it is time for one of the day's biggest races, the Ryanair Chase, which carries a generous prize of £260,000.
O'Leary insists he would sponsor Cheltenham even if he didn't love racing. "We carry an awful lot of people over 
here every year for the races, it's a very good association for us," he says. But when Ryanair is a sponsor, you 
need to be ready for surprises. Last year, as O'Leary was collecting a trophy, a heckler yelled: "Charge him a quid 
for picking it up!" Another asked how much it would cost him in "excess baggage". Today, during the Ryanair 
Chase, a man gets on to the track to protest against Ryanair's treatment of its cabin crew. He is promptly carted 
away. Afterwards, O'Leary brushes it off. "If some idiot wants to try and make some publicity for himself, let him."
And then it's time for the next race. O'Leary is gone, tearing off to see his horse in action, leaving the rest of us to 
stand and watch his rapidly disappearing back.

The ability of governments to pump public money into airport facilities and assist in the start-up of new airline 
services could change as Brussels launches a review of aid rules for the aviation sector.
Competition officials at the European Commission, which oversees Europe's state aid regime, said on Thursday 
that they wanted to review the way in which existing guidelines, dating back to 2005 and even earlier, were working.
"The air transport market has changed dramatically in the last 20 years," said Joaquin Almunia, EU competition 
commissioner. He said that Brussels wanted to see if the rules were still appropriate for current market conditions or 
needed to be changed.
Brussels has had a number of legal battles in recent years over the way in which airports, and airlines that use 
them, are in effect subsidised - including the high-profile Ryanair-Charleroi case.
It said it had received a "significant number" of complaints from companies in the sector. These involve former 
national flag carriers, unhappy at the perceived assistance that low-cost carriers may be receiving, and, conversely, 
discount airlines complaining about aid they think is flowing in the other direction.
Brussels, which is consulting on the matter until June 6, said it was particularly keen to know about recent 
developments involving the financing of airport infrastructure and start-up aid to airlines. Any rule changes would be 
likely to be announced next year.

Charlie McCreevy, the former European Union internal markets commissioner and ex-Irish government minister, 
has joined the board of Sports Direct, the retailer founded by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley.
The UK's biggest sporting goods retailer by market share on Friday said Mr McCreevy had joined as a non-
executive director with immediate effect.
Mr McCreevy, 61, who also serves on the board of budget airline Ryanair, has held several Irish government 
ministerial positions, including minister for finance and minister for tourism and trade.
During his time as an EU commissioner, Mr McCreevy championed the extension of copyright for major record 
labels and the introduction of software patents to the EU.
He also gained notoriety for stating before Ireland's failed 2008 referendum on the Lisbon treaty that he had not 
read the entire document, adding that he doubted any sane person would do so.
Mr McCreevy came under fire later that year from socialist lawmakers in Brussels who accused him of stalling on 
the regulation of hedge funds and private equity firms. Critics claimed that "commissioner McCreevy is trying to 
avoid implementing the demands of the European Parliament for regulation covering all financial players".
Following his departure from the EU commission last year, Mr McCreevy joined the board of a newly created 
banking venture targeting government-backed assets such as Northern Rock and a portfolio of branches of Lloyds 
Banking Group.
McCreevy joins Sports Direct board
The venture, created in July 2010 with directors including Sir David Walker, Lord Levene and Lord McFall, was 
initially named De Facto 9999 but a month later switched to NBNK Investments and was admitted to Aim.
But in October, Mr McCreevy was forced to step down as a director of NBNK Investments after concerns were 
raised about possible contraventions of EU conflict of interest rules, because of his former position as an EU 
commissioner.
His tenure as Irish finance minister from 1997-2004 coincided with a period of rapid growth in Ireland's economy on 
the back of a low company tax rate and substantial foreign investment. The country became known as the "Celtic 
Tiger" and attracted investment from international companies like Dell and Microsoft.
Keith Hellawell, non-executive chairman of Sports Direct, on Friday said: "We are very pleased to welcome Charles 
to the board of Sports Direct. His experience in business and as European commissioner for internal markets and 
services will be a great asset to Sports Direct."
Mr McCreevy joins Sports Direct at a time when the sports fashion, leisurewear and accessories retailer is being 
investigated by the Serious Fraud Office for alleged cartel activities with struggling rival JJB Sports .
The Serious Fraud Office in October said it would not bring charges against the two companies, but would continue 
its probe into the actions of individuals. No current employees of Sports Direct are under investigation.
Last month Sports Direct also secured a £220m loan to refinance its existing credit facility and gained clearance 
from the Competition Commission to purchase 31 stores from JJB.

Charlie McCreevy, the former European Union internal markets commissioner, has joined the board of Sports 
Direct, the retailer founded by Mike Ashley, owner of Newcastle United football club.
The UK's biggest sporting goods retailer by market share said on Friday the former Irish government minister had 
joined as a non-executive director with immediate effect.
He replaces Malcolm Dalgleish, who stepped down from the board in September.
Mr McCreevy, 61, who also serves on the board of Ryanair, the budget airline, had been minister for finance and 
minister for tourism and trade in the Irish Republic.
His experience within the EU is expected to assist Sports Direct in its efforts to expand further into continental 
Europe.
The group has retail interests in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Cyprus and Ireland.
Peter Smedley, retail analyst at Charles Stanley, said: "We know that Sports Direct has material ambitions in 
Europe, which have effectively remained in their infancy since its IPO [in February 2007]. This move will add weight 
to the board."
Keith Hellawell, non-executive chairman of Sports Direct, on Friday said of Mr McCreevy: "We are pleased to 
welcome Charles to the board.
McCreevy joins Sports Direct board
"His experience in business and as European commissioner for internal markets and services will be a great asset

As both Irish finance minister and EU commissioner, Mr McCreevy was linked to the era of light-touch regulation, 
though he also championed the extension of copyright for record labels and the introduction of software patents to 
the EU. He also gained notoriety for stating before Ireland's failed 2008 referendum on the Lisbon treaty that he had 
not read the entire document, adding that he doubted any sane person would do so.

Merchants charging artificially high fees to customers using debit or credit cards are facing investigation.
A diverse group including budget airlines, estate agents, and taxi and insurance companies, are accused of levying 
"excessive" fees to customers paying with cards, often springing the charge at the last point of transaction.
Consumer group Which? issued a complaint to the Office of Fair Trading on Wednesday asking it to probe "rip-off" 
charges.
Credit card surcharges are standard practice among some retailers, but a growing number, including estate agent 
Foxtons, broadband provider AOL and airline Ryanair, are charging for debit cards.
Budget airlines came in for particular criticism, with Ryanair charging customers a £6 administration fee per 
passenger per flight with a debit or credit card.
The airline website says fees are charged "to defray substantial costs incurred". It claimed they were not 
surcharges and pointed out that bookings made with a MasterCard Prepaid Debit Card were free.
Use of debit cards now exceeds payment in cash in the UK, driven by the popularity of shopping online.
Retailers say they are passing on fees charged by banks for card use, but untangling such fees is difficult, because 
they vary depending on retailers and cards. Chip and pin payments with bank cards carry a lower fee than online or 
telephone transactions because of the lower risk of fraud.
'Excessive' debit card fees face OFT probe
Which? claims the cost of processing is no more than 20p for a debit card and 2 per cent of the transaction value 
for credit cards.
Admiral Insurance charges a 5.95 per cent fee for credit card use. "All credit card providers charge companies for 
processing card payments and we do not charge the customer this full amount," it said.
Train booking website thetrainline.com said its £3.50 credit card charge "reflects all the costs associated with 
payments which includes the charges levied by credit card companies".
But card providers sought to distance themselves from the retailers. The UK Cards Association said it supported an 
investigation. "It is not good enough for some businesses to generate profit by imposing inflated surcharges when 
their actual card processing costs are substantially lower," said chair Melanie Johnson.
John Holmes, principal economist at Which?, accepted that card payment created a small cost to companies, but 
questioned the discrepancy with what was passed on to consumers.
"Large clothing retailers accept a large number of credit and debit card payments and do not charge, yet cab firms 
charge 12.5 per cent for debit or credit card use. We just don't see how that can possibly be a direct pass-on 
charge."

A change in night flight times and a range of other aircraft noise measures will be considered as part of the 
government's protracted efforts to forge a fresh aviation policy, it emerged on Wednesday.
But the most striking aspect of a preliminary consultation document on the new policy is its repeated emphasis on 
the need for the aviation industry to face up to the challenges of climate change.
"We are not anti-aviation, we are anti-carbon," said Philip Hammond, transport secretary, explaining the new policy 
would replace a "fundamentally out-of-date" 2003 white paper from the previous Labour government, which had 
"got the balance wrong".
"It failed to adapt its policies to the fact that climate change has become one of the gravest threats we face," he 
said.
The document will seek views by September 30 on ideas such as to change night flight regimes to give more 
respite to residents, and to set a "noise envelope" in which aviation could increase as noise per aircraft was 
reduced.
The coalition government's relations with aviation groups have been mixed since it made a ban on new runways 
around London one of its first policy announcements after last year's election.
Business and aviation groups reacted with a mix of sour resignation and polite dismissal to the so-called scoping 
document Mr Hammond published, which acknowledges "the strong view" of some business leaders about the 
need for extra airport capacity. However, it says: "We want a successful and sustainable UK aviation sector, but we 
Environment to be at heart of aviation policy rethink
need to acknowledge the environmental constraints and explore how aviation can address these challenges in 
order to allow aviation growth to occur."
David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: "The document fails to set out a clear 
plan as to how we can build our aviation capacity in the months and years ahead." Therefore, he warned, the UK's 
growth and prosperity could end up being damaged.
Ian Godden, chairman of the ADS aerospace and defence industries trade group, warned the UK would miss out on 
critical economic benefits "if it [were to be] distracted by the fog of environmentalism and nimbyism from the 
opponents of flying".
Stewart Wingate, Gatwick airport's chief executive, urged the government not to forget that the aviation industry 
generates more than £12bn each year and keeps more than 500,000 people in jobs.
In other moves on Wednesday, the Competition Commission confirmed a 2009 ruling that BAA, Heathrow's owner, 
would have to sell Stansted and either Edinburgh or Gatwick airports. Stansted should be sold first, it said, then one 
of the other Scottish airports after a "small overlap".
Separately, Ryanair announced it was to bring in a EUR2 levy per passenger for all bookings made from Monday 
April 4 to cover costs of EU requirements to cover flight cancellations and delays.
Rival airline Flybe said: "This is a smokescreen to cover their spiralling fuel costs and is a very thinly disguised fuel 
surcharge."

Ryanair's strained relationship with trade unions will come under fresh scrutiny on Tuesday when a former pilot 
appears at an employment tribunal, alleging he was sacked for handing out a union recruitment leaflet.
Captain James Anderson, 45, who had worked for the low-cost airline since 2001, was dismissed in 2009 for 
allegedly distributing trade union literature and membership forms to cabin crew during a flight.
The dispute underscores the bitter relationship between Ryanair and Balpa, the pilots' union backing the claim.
The Dublin-based carrier has always refused to negotiate with unions, and an attempt by British-based pilots to gain 
recognition for Balpa within the company failed just months before Mr Anderson was dismissed in 2009.
Ryanair is arguing that he put passengers' safety at risk by handing out leaflets when he should have been working.
Balpa says that the aircraft was on automatic pilot, with a co-pilot at the controls and that in these circumstances 
staff are usually free to eat, drink and talk to cabin crew.
Jim McAuslan, general secretary, said: "Balpa is proud to be supporting James Anderson's case, as the union 
believes that he should never have been dismissed in these circumstances.''
Ryanair said: "We have no problem with pilots distributing leaflets on their own time, but not during a flight, when 
they should be attending to the aircraft, going through their checklists and prioritising the safety of Ryanair's aircraft, 
and not the membership of failed BA trade unions."
Ryanair pilot sacked in leaflet dispute
Staff taking part in union activities are protected by law from victimisation or dismissal but only outside working 
hours.
Marc Meryon, partner at Bircham Dyson Bell LLP, said the case would hinge on whether airline safety was at risk.
"It depends on whether Ryanair can make out good safety grounds for dismissing the pilot. If the pilot can show that 
is common practice for pilots to spend time off the flight deck talking to other staff it will look as if Ryanair dismissed 
Mr Anderson because he was engaging in union activities."
The case will be heard at the east London employment tribunal from Tuesday until the end of the week.
Balpa is also involved in a dispute with budget airline Flybe. Pilots rejected a deal on pay and conditions on Monday 
and could vote on industrial action if urgent talks failed to provide a breakthrough, the union said.
The pilots will have to vote again before any industrial action takes place and Balpa will have to give seven days' 
notice of any strikes or other forms of action.
The two sides will hold urgent talks next week in a bid to resolve the dispute.

Former energy minister Tim Eggar, who has been named the new chairman of Cape, the oil services group, is 
brushing off his airmiles card.
Cape, which is poised to move from Aim to the main market, is adopting a complex corporate structure, being 
incorporated in Jersey, listed in the UK with its tax residence in Singapore.
A former corporate financier with Hambros, Mr Eggar was a Tory MP between 1979 and 1997 and was energy 
minister in the 1990s. He was chief of Monument Oil and Gas, and served on the boards of Indago Petroleum and 
Expro. Mr Eggar, who replaces Sean O'Connor in May, was the global head of ABN Amro's energy corporate 
finance group.

Family affair
Rupert Murdoch, who turns 80 this month, has put his eldest daughter Prudence MacLeod on to the board of Times

alongside Kai Diekmann, the editor of Germany's Bild newspaper, and Sir John Scarlett, former MI6 boss.

Non-exec decision

Congratulations to Centrica senior director Mary Francis, who was awarded the non-executive director of the year 
at the NED awards at the Waldorf Hilton on Wednesday.
Ms Francis, who was director-general of the ABI after a career in the Treasury, Downing Street and Buckingham 
Palace, beat Anglo American's David Challen and Rio Tinto chairman Jan du Plessis for the gong, sponsored by 
brokers Peel Hunt. The judges included Anglo chairman Sir John Parker and Centrica chairman Sir Roger Carr - 
who both recused themselves from voting on their board members - as well as Guy Jubb, head of Standard Life's 
corporate governance, and Barclays Capital banker Richard Taylor.

S Africa push
Credit Suisse is tapping in to the network of Rick Menell, a member of one of South Africa's old mining families, as 
it tries to build its business there.
Mr Menell, a geologist and former JPMorgan banker who is on the board of Weir Group, has been hired as an 
adviser to the bank in South Africa.
Credit Suisse last year ended its joint venture with Standard Bank - Credit Suisse Standard Securities - launched in 
2006.

Devilish diners
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary was his usual punchy self as he declined an invitation to the annual black tie industry 
bash hosted by the Airport Operators Association at the Grosvenor House on Tuesday. AOA chairman Ed 
Anderson read out Mr O'Leary's letter in which he said he tried to "avoid supping with the devil where ever 
possible", and "I hope all the monopolists choke on their chicken nuggets".
Virgin Atlantic chief Steve Ridgway, who gave the main speech, was also not shy of having a go at rivals. He 
congratulated BMI for one of the great start-ups of the year: it launched its new service to Tripoli on February 21 
and suspended it the next day. On British Airways, he referred to Superbrands' business top-10 list, saying Virgin 
and BA had fallen out, but making the point BA had fallen to 48th place - and Virgin only to 14th.

Power Player: Anna Walker, Welsh Water
From regulator to a director of a regulated company: Anna Walker, chairman of the Office of Rail Regulation, is 
joining the board of Welsh Water.
The 59-year-old former civil servant knows the water industry well, as she headed the government's review of 
charging and metering the sector in 2009. Ms Walker, who will remain chairman of the ORR, which she joined in 
2009, was also attracted to Welsh Water's unique model: it is run for the benefit of customers, financed by bonds 
and gives back profits as a rebate.
Long regarded as a Whitehall high-flyer with a career spanning trade, post and telecoms, energy and rural affairs, 
Ms Walker took a big decision to leave the civil service in 2004 to head the Healthcare Commission.
She had initially resisted an approach to head the new NHS inspectorate, but realised that she was interested in the 
issues surrounding healthcare and was also swayed by the fact that the new body oversaw both private and public 
companies.
Eggar will need energy at Cape
After studying history at Oxford, Ms Walker joined the British Council in 1972 and started at the Department of 
Trade in 1975. The mother of three is unlikely to take on other roles as she also chairs an epilepsy charity. She 
enjoys walking and cycling in her spare time.

Aer Lingus overcame industrial tension, volcanic ash and snow disruption to report its first profit in three years on 
Monday but warned of "significant challenges" to its earnings this year if fuel prices remained high.
Ireland's flag-carrier said it had swung to a pre-tax profit of EUR30.4m (£26m) for 2010, against a EUR154.8m pre-
tax loss in the previous year, on revenues barely changed at EUR1.2bn.
The improvements follow a year of cost-cuts and capacity reductions, and a repositioning of Aer Lingus as a 
"professional but affordable" middle choice between full-service carriers such as British Airways and budget airlines 
such as rival Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline by passenger numbers.
Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus chief executive, said the prospect of Middle East unrest, the uncertainty of having a 
home market in one of Europe's most troubled economies, and higher charges at Dublin airport meant "we expect 
significant challenges in 2011".
"We do not expect the improvements in yield performance and ongoing cost-savings can offset these increased 
costs.
"If current fuel prices persist, we expect 2011 operating profit will be significantly below that of 2010."
Aer Lingus, the latest European airline to warn of lower profits, has just over 60 per cent of its fuel hedged for 2011. 
"Clearly if oil stays at $100-plus it's a big headache," said Joe Gill of Bloxham stockbrokers.

"It was only 12 weeks ago that everybody was bulled up on airlines globally, but now everybody is extremely 
gloomy. It's a manic-depressive industry."
Ryanair is Aer Lingus's largest shareholder with a 29.8 per cent stake, following two thwarted takeover attempts. 
Another 25 per cent is held by the Irish government, which is still being formed after the weekend's elections.
Mr Mueller said the new government had "an obligation to the taxpayer" not to sell its stake when the share price 
was relatively low, and to ensure any buyer "can guarantee there will be a two-carrier policy on the Irish Sea 
sector".
- FT Comment
Investors in Ireland's oldest airline could hardly have hoped for a better result than the profits unveiled on Monday, 
having seen Aer Lingus buffeted by global recession, domestic economic crisis and a shareholder register best 
described as tricky. The news came in the same breath as a profit warning amid the familiar uncertainty of rising 
fuel prices. Such is life in the airline industry. A forward p/e ratio of 8.9 times may make Aer Lingus look attractive 
compared with Irish neighbour Ryanair (12.8 times) or the UK's EasyJet (9.6 times), but with so much uncertainty, 
only the brave will be buying into airlines any time soon.

Calls to renegotiate Irish bail-out

Ireland's leading business organisation and its best known executive have backed calls for a new government to 
demand a renegotiation of the EUR85bn bail-out deal agreed with the European Union and International Monetary 
Fund.
"Until now we would have been fairly bullish about what is happening in the real economy, but if there are further 
calls for state support to be given to the banks then I think our debt ratios will reach a tipping point," said Fergal 
O'Brien, chief economist with Irish Business and Employers Confederation.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, the low cost airline, said a new government would be "absolutely right 
to seek a renegotiation" of the bail-out programme.
In Friday's general election, the centre-right Fine Gael is on course to become the largest party in parliament and is 
likely to form a government with the centre-left Labour party, its traditional coalition ally.
Both parties are committed to seeking a renegotiation of the bail-out to reduce its crippling cost to the Irish taxpayer, 
even while the bondholders who lent to Ireland's broken banks are repaid in full.
"I don't think the renegotiation should be based on the fact that they're lending to us at 6 per cent and they're 
borrowing at 3," Mr O'Leary told the Financial Times in an interview in his Dublin airport offices.
"I think it should be based on the fact the debt that is being run up now by Ireland, Portugal and Spain is going to 
need a European debt restructuring model. The Irish economy simply can't shoulder additional financing charges of 
EUR5bn a year when we're running a fiscal deficit of EUR10-15bn."
Calls to renegotiate Irish bail-out
The EU-IMF deal was the key issue in the last party leaders' television debate on Tuesday night when Eamon 
Gilmore, Labour leader, said the bail-out had created a "straitjacket" for any incoming government.
The new administration was "going to face the biggest mess that any incoming government will face", he said.
However, Micheal Martin, leader of Fianna Fáil and foreign minister in the outgoing government, said the deal could 
not be renegotiated unilaterally. He said it would require "intelligent diplomacy" to secure a better deal.
Mr O'Leary also said Ireland was "ripe for fairly radical reform of the public sector" and urged the incoming 
government to take "the tough medicine".
He said: "I don't think the business environment in Ireland will be changed by a change of government, but I think 
it's going to be changed by what I hope will be the tough restructuring reforms imposed by the IMF."
The IBEC, however, warned the incoming government against any attempt to sell state companies, because of 
concerns that it would receive only fire sale prices for the assets.
The comments are seen as a clear warning to Fine Gael, which says it wants to use the proceeds of asset sales to 
fund a jobs creation plan.
Mr O'Brien said it would "not be in the best national interest" to sell assets "at a time when there is a perception out 
there that Ireland is in fire sale mode".
Mr Kenny on Wednesday unveiled his plan for his first 100 days in office should he become prime minister, saying 
he would force ministers to concentrate on their immediate tasks and end the "circus" of ministerial attendance at 
ceremonies and other events.
"I have seen the circus around the country for the last number of years where day after day plaques are unveiled at 
pump houses and tapes are cut," Mr Kenny said.
He said he would recall Ireland's ambassadors and also all officials for overseas trade bodies who would be 
"extensively and precisely briefed on the new urgency of our marketing position and strategy".

Credit and debit card charges are 'excessive'

The consumer group Which? is to launch a "super complaint" against "excessive" credit and debit card charges 
imposed on consumers when buying flights and other services.
The watchdog is calling on the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to investigate the charges, saying they are often 
"sprung" on the customer at the point of payment and could be far in excess of what it costs the retailer to process 
the transaction.
Retailers, local authorities, estate agents and cinemas all imposed the charges, it claimed, with low-cost airlines the 
worst offenders.
Which? said it believed the actual cost to the retailer was no more than 20p for a debit card transaction or a 
percentage of a credit card transaction, thought to be no more than 2 per cent. However, charges to the consumer 
are often a fixed amount or can increase based on the number of people buying tickets.
It cites an example of a family of four booking a return flight with Ryanair. It says they would be charged £40 to pay 
by card when the cost to the airline would be around 20p to process a debit card payment and no more than 2 per 
cent of the transaction value for a credit card. The same family would be charged £38 by Flybe and £5.50 by 
easyJet for paying for return flights by card.
When the super-complaint is handed to the OFT on 7 March, the regulator will be required to give a response within 
90 days. If the regulator thinks there is a case to answer, then it can decide to launch a full investigation in its own 
right.
Credit and debit card charges are 'excessive'
Which? said it wanted retailers to tell consumers about any surcharges upfront "in plain language" in their 
advertising and promotions, and wants fees to match the actual cost to retailers, or for retailers to absorb the "very 
small" cost of debit card transactions.
Peter Vicary-Smith, Which? chief executive, said: "Paying by card should cost the consumer the same amount that 
it costs the retailer. Companies shouldn't be using card processing costs as an excuse for boosting their profits.
"Low-cost airlines are some of the worst offenders when it comes to excessive card surcharges but this murky 
practice is becoming ever more widespread, from cinemas to hotels and even some local authorities."
Travel comparison website www.travelsupermarket.com said it supported the campaign. Bob Atkinson, travel expert 
at Travelsupermarket.com, said: "Whilst there are some charges associated with taking payments by credit and 
debit card to travel providers, there is no excuse for these high costs. Travel companies are clearly seizing an 
opportunity to cash in."
The comparison site conducted research last summer that found that major UK tour operators and travel agents 
were charging anything from 1- 3 per cent of the total price of a holiday in card charges and said this could add up 
to £60 to a £2000 family holiday.
"Many customers feel compelled to pay for their trips on credit cards as they know that this will give them financial 
protection under the Consumer Credit Directive," said Mr Atkinson. "However they are paying for the privilege of 
this through card fees. A Visa debit card will give you similar protection and with either no fee or certainly a lower 
fee in most cases, making this option a cheaper way of getting similar protection."
The UK Cards Association is also backing the "super-complaint". Melanie Johnson, chair of The UK Cards 
Association, said: "The UK Cards Association called for Government action to curb excessive surcharging for card 
payments ahead of the last election. It is high time customers are given a voice where the true cost of what they are 
buying is made clear to them.
"We are happy to support Which? when they launch their super-complaint as it is not good enough for some 
businesses to generate profit by imposing inflated surcharges when their actual card processing costs are 
substantially lower."

Ryanair suffers EUR10m third-quarter loss

Ryanair has blamed higher fuel costs, industrial action by air traffic controllers and snow-related airport closures for 
the budget carrier's third-quarter loss of more than EUR10m.
The loss comes in spite of passenger numbers at the Irish airline increasing by 1m to 17m in the period, and 
turnover rising by 22 per cent to EUR746m.
The average fare price rose 15 per cent to EUR34, and ancillary revenues - which include baggage fees, travel 
insurance, onboard snacks and other non-ticket items - increased by 12.6 per cent to EUR9.80 per passenger.
Although the EUR10.3m third-quarter loss narrowed slightly from EUR10.9m in the same period in 2009, Michael 
O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the results were "disappointing".
"Earnings were hit by a series of air traffic controller strikes/walkouts, compounded by a spate of bad weather 
airport closures in December," he said in a statement on Monday.
Europe's biggest low-cost airline by market capitalisation said that it cancelled more than 3,000 flights in the third 
quarter, compared with about 1,400 during the 2009-10 financial year.
Heavy snowfalls forced flight cancellations to many European cities in December, and runways were closed at 
airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Edinburgh.
Ryanair suffers EUR10m third-quarter loss
Ryanair also said that the rising price of crude had boosted its fuel costs, with the airline noting "a 37 per cent 
increase in our fuel bill", although Mr O'Leary said the group was 90 per cent hedged for its fourth-quarter at $750 a 
tonne.
"Our outlook for the fourth-quarter and the remainder of the financial year 2011 remains largely unchanged," said 
Mr O'Leary. "We expect traffic and average fares to continue to benefit from a better mix of new routes and bases, 
and competitor fuel surcharges.
"Accordingly, we are now confident that our fourth-quarter and full year results will be towards the upper end of our 
previously guided range of a net profit after tax of between EUR380m to EUR400m."
Last year the Dublin-based group increased its full-year earnings estimates after posting a healthy profit for the six 
months to the end of September.
Mr O'Leary also attempted to distance the carrier from Ireland's financial difficulties, and asserted that "the 
widespread negative commentary on the Irish economy has been allowed to cloud some analysis of Ryanair's 
future growth and profitability".
"Ireland has fallen from over 20 per cent of Ryanair's originating traffic to less than 10 per cent in the current year. 
Ryanair has little exposure to the Irish economy," he said.
Analysts at Panmure Gordon held their "buy" recommendation on Ryanair stock, but added a note of caution.
"Next year will provide some challenges as economic conditions remain uncertain. Fuel prices will be higher but this 
is an industry-wide issue and we expect this to result in higher yields," they said.
Shares in Ryanair, which expects to carry 73.5m passengers in the 2010-11 financial year, rose 10.8 cents, or 3 per 
cent, to EUR3.73 in early Dublin trading.

Ryanair and EasyJet might seem much of a muchness to Europe's travellers, but to investors they are a class 
apart. Shares in Ryanair, which is the more profitable and reliable, usually trade at a deserved premium to those of 
its smaller rival.
During the past six months, that premium has narrowed on signs that EasyJet is pulling itself together at last. 
Carolyn McCall and Chris Kennedy, the new chief executive and finance director, promised to fix embarrassing 
operational mishaps, such as cabin crew finding themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. They brokered a 
truce with Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, EasyJet's founder and largest shareholder, who has been agitating for less 
growth and more profit. The pair also came up with a reasonable strategy: buy fewer planes, attract more business 
travellers and lift pre-tax profit per seat from £3.36 last year to £5.
Ryanair also plans to slow down and increase fares after several years of breakneck growth. It is still better at the 
execution, though. In January, EasyJet reported stagnant revenue per passenger in the latest quarter, sounded the 
alarm on oil prices and said its loss in the six months to March would be double that of a year ago. Ryanair, 
meanwhile, reported a 13 per cent rise in revenue per passenger, revealed prudent oil hedges and reaffirmed its 
full-year profit guidance. Ms McCall and Mr Kennedy have not worked at an airline before and could use some 
decent macroeconomic (and meteorological) conditions while they settle in. Instead they face oil prices touching 
$100 a barrel - particularly painful for low-cost airlines. The gap between EasyJet's valuation (about 8 times next 
year's expected earnings) and Ryanair's (about 11 times) should widen again. In difficult times, investors can 
expect to pay extra for an experienced pair of hands.

Concerns that turmoil in Egypt could spread to engulf other Arab nations and send oil prices further higher left 
European equities lower on Monday.
Moody's, which on Monday downgraded Egypt, flagged particular difficulties for building material companies with 
exposure to the market.
Lafarge, the Paris-listed cement group that also has significant operations in Egypt, slipped 1.5 per cent to 
EUR43.35.
The French bank Société Générale fell 2.6 per cent to EUR47.05 on concerns about its exposure to the Egyptian 
market through its National Société Générale Bank. The country's financial markets remain closed and reports 
indicate that retail banks and ATMs have been a particular target in the looting that has hit some cities.
But not all companies exposed to the chaos in Cairo underperformed.
Heineken, the Dutch brewer estimated to have sales in Egypt of EUR160m, decided on Monday to shut its in-
country production there. Its shares went up 0.1 per cent to EUR36.81, outperforming an overall 0.3 per cent slip in 
the Amsterdam market.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.4 per cent to 1,138.98 in early trading.
European equities hurt by Cairo concerns
Among the morning's winners were Ryanair, the Irish discount airline, which announced rising passenger numbers 
and higher average fares. The group, which also said it has been able to hedge against rising oil prices, rose 1.9 
per cent to EUR3.69.
Carrefour, the French retail group, rose 1.8 per cent to EUR34.58 after the newspaper Le Figaro reported that it 
might seek to boost its valuation by listing its retail estate and discount group.
Continued drama about potential insider trading in EADS, the French aerospace group, drove down the shares of 
involved companies.
Lagardère, the Paris-listed media conglomerate, announced on Friday that it had been formally placed under 
investigation for alleged insider trading. The media group's shares fell 2.9 per cent to EUR32.53.
EADS' shares slipped 1.6 per cent to EUR21.32. Daimler, the German carmaker that is a major EADS shareholder, 
was the worst performing stock in Frankfurt as it fell 2 per cent to EUR53.73. French regulators had cleared Daimler 
of insider trading two years ago.

EU blocks on tie-ups to stay 'very rare'

Joaquín Almunia, the European Union's competition chief, said regulatory blocks on corporate mergers would 
remain "very rare" in spite of announcing on Wednesday the first prohibition by Brussels in almost four years.
As predicted, the European Commission refused to give a green light to the proposed merger between two Greek 
airlines, Athens-listed Aegean Airlines and Olympic Air.
EU officials said that the tie-up would have resulted in a "quasi-monopoly" on the Greek air transport market, and 
that it would have meant higher fares for four out of six million Greek and European consumers travelling on routes 
to and from Athens each year.
The carriers, which have been in discussions with the commission for months, had offered to release slots at 
various Greek airports, including Athens, and provide other remedies such as interlink agreements and access to 
their frequent flyer programmes.
But Mr Almunia said that these were insufficient to ensure that consumers would not be harmed. The problem, he 
suggested, was not a lack of slots at Greek airports but that the remedies were unlikely to entice a new and credible 
player into creating a base at Athens airport and providing effective competition on key routes.
He revealed that the commission had suggested other possible structural remedies - involving portions of the 
companies' fleet and brand names - but no satisfactory agreement could be reached.
The proposed deal is the first to be blocked by Brussels since Ryanair's plan to take over rival Irish carrier Aer 
Lingus was barred in 2007. On Wednesday, Mr Almunia pointed out that in the past six years, Brussels had only 
EU blocks on tie-ups to stay 'very rare'
blocked three deals and since 1989 it had reviewed more than 4,500 merger cases and taken only 20 prohibition 
decisions.
"Prohibition decision will remain rare since in most cases we are able to accept the solutions proposed by the 
parties," he said.
Mr Almunia's message was underscored later on Wednesday when Brussels cleared the proposed acquisition by 
Intel of security software group McAfee and the planned purchase of International Power by GDF Suez, but made 
both decisions subject to conditions.
The Intel remedies involve the world's biggest chipmaker committing to ensuring that vendors of rival security 
products will have access to all necessary information to use the functionalities of Intel central processing units and 
chipsets in the same way as McAfee, and also pledging not to impede rival solutions for running on Intel CPUs or 
chipsets. It will also avoid hampering the use of McAfee products running on computers that use chips made by 
competitors.
Commitments in the GDF Suez case relate to the Belgian electricity market and involve the divestiture on IP's 
holding in the T-Power plant and the transfer to third parties of the operation and maintenance agreement for the 
plant.

European antitrust regulators are poised to block a proposed merger for the first time in almost four years.
The decision to give a red light to the planned tie-up between Olympic Airlines and fellow Greek carrier Aegean will 
be announced on Wednesday by Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner.
Separately, Mr Almunia is expected to give a conditional go-ahead to another contentious takeover deal, the $7.7bn 
purchase of US security software company McAfee by Intel, after the world's biggest chipmaker offered 
concessions.
The Greek airline merger will be the first takeover to face outright opposition from EU competition officials since 
Ryanair was told that it could not acquire rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus in mid-2007.
It has been rare for Brussels to block takeovers recently - although some transactions have been voluntarily 
withdrawn when faced by official scrutiny and many others have offered concessions in order to win approval.
Between 1994 and 2003, for example, the European Commission blocked 23 mergers out of the more than 2,000 
deals notified. But between 2004 and 2010 only two deals were barred.
The Greek airline decision will come seven months after Athens-listed Aegean notified the Commission of its plans 
to acquire local rival Olympic Airlines. Olympic was, for many years, Greece's state-owned carrier, but it was 
privatised and relaunched in 2009 after an earlier tussle with Brussels.
EU to veto Olympic tie-up with Aegean
The merger deal was depicted in Athens as a response to the Greek financial crisis and the tough conditions in the 
airline sector. But Commission officials opened a probe into the proposed tie-up last July and said they were 
worried that the combined entity would have "very high, if not monopolistic, market shares on all domestic routes 
and on a number of international routes where both parties operate". Efforts to resolve those worries through 
concessions by the carriers have not been successful.
By contrast, Intel - another company which has had past problems with competition officials in Brussels - is 
expected to have headed off a full probe into its proposed acquisition of McAfee by offering a set of remedies.
This transaction has already been cleared by US regulators. The concessions which the Commission will accept 
are thought to be designed to reduce Intel's ability to disadvantage security software from other companies from 
running on computers that use Intel chips.

Italian banks stood out on European equity markets, helping lift the country's main stock index, which outperformed 
most of the region.
Sovereign debt concerns eased, with spreads between Italian government bond yields and those of German Bunds 
narrowing. Meanwhile, investors were still focused on the potential for deals in the Italian banking sector as bidders 
for UniCredit's Pioneer asset management unit carried out due diligence.
An investment note by Deutsche Bank from Wednesday continued to resonate in the Italian financial sector. 
Deutsche said it favoured stocks that had recently been oversold as the sector concentrated on liquidity 
management.
"Unicredit among the large caps, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena among the mid-caps and Banca Popolare di 
Milano, which is upgraded to 'buy' among the small caps," were the broker's top picks said analyst Paola Sabbione.
BMPS was the biggest gainer on the FTSE Eurofirst 300, up 4.1 per cent to EUR0.94, while UniCredit added 1.7 
per cent to EUR1.81 but BMP slipped 0.3 per cent to EUR3.04, having gained 3.5 per cent in the previous session.
Also in Italy's financial sector, Intesa Sanpaolo climbed 2.7 per cent to EUR2.35, while Ubi Banca added 1.9 per 
cent to EUR7.35 and Generali gained 2.3 per cent to EUR15.34.
Overall, however, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was down 0.8 per cent to 1,142.96, weighed down by a 0.8 per cent 
fall on Frankfurt's Xetra Dax to 7,028.98 and a 0.7 per cent loss on the CAC 40 in Paris to 3,950.3.
Italian banks outperform as Europe stocks fall
Back in Italy, the biggest weight holding the MIB index back was carmaker Fiat after Fitch rating agency said that 
strong earnings when the company reports full-year numbers next week, would have no impact on its rating 
following the negative impact of the company's demerger. The shares of Fiat were down 4.9 per cent to EUR7.24.
Fiat Industrial, which was spun off at the beginning of the year, fell 5.1 per cent to EUR9.92. The truckmaker, which 
manufactures Iveco lorries, is one of a number of companies being investigated by the European Commission for 
running a price-fixing cartel.
Others include Sweden's Scania, which fell 4 per cent to SKr139.50 and Germany's MAN, which lost 3.9 per cent to 
EUR84.68.
Airline shares were lower after Britain's EasyJet said its first-half loss may double due to surging fuel costs and 
cancelled flights.
Ryanair fell 5.6 per cent to EUR3.52, the biggest loss on the Eurofirst 300, Air France-KLM lost 4.2 per cent to 
EUR13.31 and Lufthansa shed 2.1 per cent to EUR15.74.

EasyJet, Europe's second-biggest budget airline in terms of passengers, reported a jump in traffic for December 
just a day after rival British Airways said it expected the severe snow disruption last month to cost it £50m ($78m).
The number of seats sold at Luton-based EasyJet rose to 3.6m in December, a 7.6 per cent increase compared 
with the same month a year earlier.
BA's global passenger numbers fell 10.8 per cent over the same period to 2.1m after hundreds of its flights were 
cancelled at its home airport of Heathrow.
Freezing conditions closed a runway there for more than three days, stranding thousands the week before 
Christmas.
EasyJet was helped by the fact that it operates from the smaller London airports of Luton, Gatwick and Stansted, 
which did not suffer as much snow disruption. More broadly, however, the December figures underline the growing 
gap between BA and its budget airline rivals in Europe.
EasyJet and Ryanair, the region's largest no-frills carrier by passenger numbers, sold a combined 8.6m seats in 
December, while BA's figure for the UK and Europe was just 1.17m.
"BA's numbers were undoubtedly affected by snow," said analyst Joe Gill of Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin. "But 
there is still a structural shift from legacy carriers to low-cost carriers. The fact that Ryanair and EasyJet combined 
are now seven times larger than BA on short-haul routes in Europe is interesting."
EasyJet bookings take off in spite of snow
Ryanair also recorded a rise in traffic for December, even though its home airport of Dublin was also hit by heavy 
snow.
Its passenger numbers rose 2 per cent to 5m last month, taking its total for the 12 months to December to 72.7m.
That is well above the 49.7m passengers EasyJet reported for 2010, and more than double BA's total.
When traffic volumes are measured by revenue passenger kilometres, which represents the number of fare-paying 
customers multiplied by the distances they fly, BA's larger number of longer international routes have long seen its 
figures dwarf those of both Ryanair and EasyJet.
BA's monthly traffic reports include both passenger numbers and revenue passenger kilometre movements, while 
Ryanair and EasyJet disclose only the more flattering passenger numbers each month.
Shares in EasyJet rose 13.9p to 468.9p on Friday, while BA shares added 5.4p to 305.6p and Ryanair rose 5.6 
cents to EUR3.96.

EasyJet, Europe's second biggest budget airline in terms of passengers, has reported a sharp jump in traffic for 
December, a day after its older rival, British Airways, said it expected severe snow disruption in that month to cost it 
at least £50m.
The Luton-based no-frills airline saw the number of booked seats jump to 3.6m in December, a 7.6 per cent 
increase compared with the same month a year earlier.
BA's passenger numbers fell 10.8 per cent over the same period to 2.1m after hundreds of its flights were cancelled 
at its home airport of Heathrow, where freezing conditions closed a runway for more than three days stranding 
thousands the week before Christmas.
EasyJet was helped by the fact that unlike BA, it does not operate mainly out of Heathrow but from the smaller 
London airports of Luton, Gatwick and Stansted, which did not suffer as much disruption.
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline by passenger numbers, also recorded a rise in traffic for December, even 
though its home airport of Dublin was hit by heavy snows. Its traffic rose 2 per cent to 5m last month, taking total 
passenger numbers for the 12 months to December 2010 to 72.7m.
That is well above the 49.7m passengers that EasyJet reported for 2010 and more than double BA's total for the 
year.

seen its figures dwarf those of both Ryanair and EasyJet.

British Airways will suffer a financial hit of at least £50m because of the snow that caused travel chaos in its home 
airport of Heathrow in the week before Christmas, new figures show.
BA traffic volumes for December fell by a hefty 8.3 per cent compared with the same month in 2009, after a large 
fall of snow closed one of Heathrow's two runways for more than three days, stranding thousands of passengers in 
one of the year's busiest holiday weeks.
The flag-carrier said an initial assessment suggested the disruption would have a financial impact of £50m in the 
third quarter and a small extra cost in January because of cancelled return journeys.
Shares in BA were up 3.5 per cent an hour after the airline released the figures, however, as investors digested 
numbers that were within expectations.
In addition, so-called premium traffic in the most profitable business and first-class seats fell only 1.6 per cent in 
December, compared with a 9.6 per cent decline in economy seat traffic.
However, the December traffic decline brings to a halt three months of steady increases in BA's passenger 
numbers, as measured by revenue passenger kilometres, or the number of fare-paying passengers multiplied by 
the distances they fly.
The airline had seen its traffic volumes rise from September after suffering large declines as a result of the volcanic 
ash disruption in April; strike action in March and May and severe weather problems in January last year, when 
traffic fell 7 per cent.
BA warns of £50m hit from bad weather
And some of the airline's rivals have seen much healthier passenger figures.
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline in terms of passenger and revenue numbers, said its December traffic, as 
measured by the number of booked seats sold, had risen 2 per cent to 5m compared with the same month a year 
ago.

British Airways will take a dent in its income of at least £50m because of the snow that caused travel chaos in its 
home airport of Heathrow in the week before Christmas, new figures show.
BA traffic volumes for December fell by 8.3 per cent compared with the same month in 2009, after a large fall of 
snow closed one of Heathrow's two runways for more than three days, stranding thousands of passengers in one of 
the year's busiest holiday weeks.
The disruption stranded thousands of passengers in one of the year's busiest holiday weeks, leading to calls for the 
head of BAA, Heathrow's owner, to resign.
BA said it thought the weather problems would cost it about £50m in the third quarter and there would be "some 
small additional impact" in January because of cancelled return journeys.
The fresh financial blow comes after BA, which has only just started returning to profit after two years of heavy 
losses, suffered extra costs from a series of cabin crew strikes, bad weather and the disruption that followed the 
eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull in April 2010.
Investors had been expecting the poor figures, however, and shares in BA closed more than 4 per cent higher at 
300.2p. Analysts noted that traffic in the most profitable business and first-class seats fell only 1.6 per cent in 
December, compared with a 9.6 per cent slide in economy.
In addition, so-called premium traffic in the most profitable business and first-class seats fell only 1.6 per cent in 
December, compared with a 9.6 per cent decline in economy seat traffic.
BA warns of £50m bad weather costs
However, the December traffic decline brings to a halt three months of steady increases in BA's passenger 
numbers, as measured by revenue passenger kilometres, or the number of fare-paying passengers multiplied by 
the distances they fly.
The airline had seen its traffic volumes rise from September after suffering large declines as a result of the volcanic 
ash disruption in April; strike action in March and May and severe weather problems in January last year, when 
traffic fell 7 per cent.
Some of the airline's rivals have seen much healthier passenger figures.
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline in terms of revenue, said its passenger numbers rose 2 per cent in 
December, as measured by the number of booked seats, compared with the same month a year earlier.
But larger intercontinental airlines such as BA are expected to keep reporting losses as a result of poor winter 
weather on both sides of the Atlantic.
In the US, Delta said on Thursday that December's bad weather in the US and Europe had reduced its net profit for 
the fourth quarter by about $45m (£29m) from previous expectations.
The December figures brought to a sharp halt three months of steady increases in BA's monthly passenger 
numbers, as measured by revenue passenger kilometres, or the number of fare-paying passengers multiplied by 
the distances they fly.
Separately on Thursday, BA said it had signed contracts to buy Rolls-Royce engines for up to 61 new wide-body 
passenger jets, including at least 12 A380 superjumbos, in the first deal the UK engine maker has signed since one 
of its engines blew apart on a Qantas A380 in November.
The BA order is worth up to $5bn at advertised prices and the manufacturer's shares rose slightly on what some 
analysts described as reassuring news, given the Qantas incident.
But others said they expected little impact from an order first announced in 2007. "More important would be a new 
win" from an airline that had not chosen an engine for the A380, said Nick Cunningham of Agency Partners.

European equities retreated in the last full trading session of the year, weighed down by data indicating that 
Chinese economic expansion was slowing.
Purchasing managers' indices showed that growth in China's manufacturing sector had slowed slightly in 
December, although the figures still showed that growth was above the long term average.
Traders took this as a sign that China's economy might not accelerate in 2011 as fast as they had thought. This, 
partly helped by low volumes, caused export-led stocks to lose ground.
The markets in Germany, Europe's biggest exporter, saw some of the biggest losses. The Xetra Dax index lost 1.2 
per cent to 6,914.19, led by BASF, the world's largest chemicals producer by revenues, which fell 2.7 per cent to 
EUR59.70.
Frankfurt-listed ThyssenKrupp, the steelmaker, declined 1.6 per cent to EUR30.99, weighing on the Eurofirst 
General Industrials index, which slipped 2.1 per cent to 2,659.49.
Germany's Volkswagen declined 2 per cent to EUR121.40, along with the rest of the automotive sector. The 
Eurofirst Auto & Parts index fell 0.6 per cent to 1,185.90.
Overall, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index dropped 1.3 per cent to 1,128.55, paring some of the 7.1 per cent gains that 
had been made in December and bringing the index down to its lowest level in nearly two weeks.
Europe's bourses finish year on flat note
The Eurofirst had been on course for the biggest December rally for a decade, but that looked out of reach after the 
session's losses. Volumes were low, with only half the usual number of trades placed in the session.
Elsewhere in the region, airline stocks lost ground as the International Air Transport Association reported that the 
growth in international air traffic had slowed in November, adding that the harsh weather conditions had weighed on 
many businesses.
Germany's Lufthansa, Europe's biggest airline group, fell 1.9 per cent to EUR16.36 on the news, while Ireland's 
Ryanair was down 1.5 per cent to EUR3.73. The Eurofirst Travel & Leisure index dropped 1.3 per cent to 1,324.15, 
falling back from recent record highs.
The session also saw the VDAX volatility index climb 6.8 per cent to 19.96.
Looking back on 2010, there was a divergence in performance between so-called "core" and "peripheral" eurozone 
nations.
Markets in the core of Europe and the Nordic countries broadly did well, particularly towards the end of the year, 
lifted by hopes of a strong global economic recovery.
Germany's Xetra Dax index has risen 16.1 per cent in the year, for example, while Sweden's OMXS30 index has 
gained 21.4 per cent.
However, in the peripheries, the indices have lost ground, weighed down by the sovereign debt troubles that forced 
Greece and then Ireland into bail-outs.
Spain's Ibex 35 index has pulled back 17.4 per cent over the year while Italy's FTSE MIB has fallen 13.2 per cent.
Similarly, the Eurofirst Banks index has fallen 9.1 per cent in 2010, largely because of sovereign debt concerns. 
The General Industrials index, however, has jumped 39.6 per cent on hopes of a strong recovery.
"The European sovereign debt crisis was one of the key themes of 2010 and there is certainly much more to play 
out on this one in 2011," said Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index.
Gains in Germany and Sweden this year have outpaced the S&P 500 index in the US, which has added 11 per cent 
this year.

After 12 months of talks, officials say they have reached agreement on a groundbreaking deal that will significantly 
raise the cost of financing new passenger jets for many of the world's best-known airlines.
The new pact on export credit financing, negotiated by the European Union, the US and eight other countries 
through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is expected to be formally approved next 
month and introduced on February 1.
It follows frantic last-minute lobbying from airlines such as Ryanair, Etihad of Abu Dhabi and Luxembourg's 
Cargolux, which claim the pact is based on "arbitrary" policy-making and will create a "bonanza" for banks.
Boeing and Airbus, the world's largest aircraft makers, have also been lobbying in recent days, claiming the 
arrangements could dampen demand for their passenger jets and could lead to production cuts.
But the agreement will probably be welcomed by airlines in Europe and the US, including Lufthansa, British Airways 
and Delta, which have been unable to make use of the guarantees export credit agencies offer carriers such as 
Ryanair and Etihad to support commercial loans for aircraft purchases.
It also ends what critics say has been a market distortion that has inflated aircraft production during the global 
recession.
The deal will mean airlines using export credit agencies such as the US Export-Import Bank or France's Coface to 
help finance their passenger jets will face fees linked much closer to market rates.
Aircraft financing deal reached
Following lobbying last week by Airbus, negotiators agreed quarterly adjustments of these fees will not lead to rises 
of more than 10 per cent from the rate set in the previous quarter, officials familiar with the negotiations told the 
Financial Times.
It has also been agreed that existing, more generous export financing rules will effectively be kept in place or 
"grandfathered" for aircraft due to be delivered up until the end of 2012, to protect financing arrangements already 
negotiated.
Aircraft grandfathered in a previous 2007 deal, including some of Airbus's A380 superjumbos, will be "great-
grandfathered" in the new agreement, though small financial penalties will be applied.
The Aviation Alliance lobby group, which includes Ryanair and other airlines that have long used export credit 
financing, said the grandfathering should have been extended for at least three years through 2013, and warned 
they would keep fighting.
"If this deal goes through we will be trying to have it overturned because it is cartel pricing," said Howard Millar, 
Ryanair finance director.
The text of the agreement, which includes a February 1 starting date, is still subject to final clearance from 
governments in the US, the European Union and eight other countries that have been party to the talks. This is 
expected by January 20.
But officials close to the negotiations said on Tuesday that the resolution of final sticking points such as the 
grandfathering clauses meant agreement had effectively been reached.

The disruption caused by the UK's pre-Christmas spell of extreme winter weather started to take a toll on transport 
and retail stocks on Monday.
British Airways was the main casualty on the FTSE 100. As the problems at the UK's main airports continued for a 
third day, thousand of passengers remained stranded at London's airports. The company cancelled 70 of its 130 
scheduled departures from Heathrow scheduled for Monday. The stock lost 2.2 per cent to 264.3p.
Heathrow airport was the worst-hit in Europe, and is set to remain closed until later on Monday at the earliest. Just 
a handful of flights took off on Sunday and the airport was closed to arrivals. At Gatwick, the last-minute arrival of 
extra snowploughs helped it to limit its closure to four-and-a-half hours.
Airline shares were lower across the board. EasyJet fell 1.2 per cent to 428.8p, while Ryanair was 0.6 per cent 
weaker at EUR3.72p. Tour operator Tui Travel lost 0.8 per cent to 236.8p. Other transport stocks fared little better, 
with similar disruption across the road and rail network. FirstGroup, the train operator, was 0.1 per cent softer at 
225.3p, while car hire company Avis fell 2.8 per cent to 225.3p.
Retailers also suffered because of the prospect that the snow could have left shoppers unable or unwilling to 
venture out on the last weekend before Christmas, what should be one of the busiest times on the high street. 
Marks & Spencer fell 1.2 per cent to 371.2p. Next lost 1.8 per cent to £1949 and Tesco fell 0.6 per cent to 431p.
"Bad weather across much of Europe may see some selective selling - it can't be doing any favours for retailers in 
what should be a seasonally busy time, whilst transport operators are also going to be left looking at some chunky 
liabilities," summarised Ben Potter, research analyst at IG Markets.
Cold snap hits London travel and retail stocks
"Adding this backdrop to the relatively limited fundamentals we're going to see in the coming hours and it has the 
potential to make for a very quiet day ahead."
Overall, London equities continued to trade steadily, with defensive stocks continuing to provide the bulwark of 
support for the market.
As traders continued to seek out protection for the gains made during the FTSE 100's December rally, the 
benchmark index added 7 points to 5,878.39, a rise of 0.1 per cent. The modest gain came after a 1 per cent 
increase over the previous week took the total advance for December to 6.2 per cent. It also kept the FTSE 100 
within reach of its 2010 high of 5,907.12, reached last week.
The benchmark index's best single performer was Essar Energy, up 1.8 per cent to 558p. Defence contractor 
Cobham was 1.9 per cent stronger at 202½p. Electricity distributor National Grid was 1.5 per cent higher at 560½p. 
Water utility Severn Trent was 1.4 per cent stronger at £14.56.

Airbus has made a last-ditch appeal to Germany, France and the UK to water down an export financing deal that 
would make it more expensive for many airlines to buy the aircraft maker's passenger jets.
In a move that puts the Toulouse-based manufacturer at odds with some of its biggest airline customers, Tom 
Enders, chief executive, wrote earlier this week to governments in each country urging them to modify the impact of 
an international agreement being discussed in Paris on Friday.
Airbus has plants in all three nations.
A draft of the new agreement shows airlines that finance their jets with support from export credit agencies, such as 
France's Coface or Germany's Euler Hermes, face a rise in the fees they pay for guarantees provided for 
commercial loans taken out for jet purchases.
The fees, which would vary according to an airline's credit profile, would be adjusted quarterly in an effort to make 
them more reflective of market conditions.
Mr Enders said Airbus, a unit of the EADS aerospace and defence group, wanted any quarterly movements in the 
fees to be capped to make sure they did not rise more than 10 per cent from the rate set the previous quarter.
He also urged the governments to make sure current, more generous export financing rules, be kept in place or 
"grandfathered" for aircraft due to be delivered up until December 2012 at the earliest.
Airbus in plea over export financing
In a further sign of the controversy surrounding the new rules, Ryanair, Emirates and other airlines in a lobby group 
that use export guarantees, were on Thursday night preparing to write a separate letter urging the higher fees not to 
be applied to aircraft delivered within the next three years.
Export credit guarantees have been a boon to many airlines, especially during the recent credit crisis when 
commercial loans became expensive and scarce, leading export credit financing to soar to record levels. However, 
airlines based in the home countries of Airbus and its US rival, Boeing - including Delta, Air France and British 
Airways - cannot get such financial support to buy their jets.
They have lobbied for it to be made more expensive to end what they say is a damaging market distortion that gives 
an unfair advantage to fast-growing rivals such as Emirates and Ryanair.
This is what officials negotiating the new export financing agreement at the Paris-based OECD's headquarters over 
the past year have done.
Airbus said there were several problems with the draft under discussion in Paris this week which would make it 
"unworkable" for airlines.
If the agreement is approved as it stands, "there is a danger it could produce a degree of nervousness in the market 
as to how much financing is going to cost", Airbus said, adding that this could cause problems in the event of 
another credit crisis or major market disruption.
"In the past it [export credit financing] was seen as more of a port in the storm, providing a stable form of funding at 
a reasonably predictable cost," the company said.
"In the case of another crisis, with extreme hikes in rates clients may choose not to take aircraft and that could 
cause production cuts and resulting job losses."

Airlines around the world face a sharp rise in the cost of buying passenger jets under new export financing rules to 
be discussed by government officials in Paris this week, confidential documents prepared for their meeting reveal.
The rules would mean many airlines that have long used export credit agencies to help finance some of their jets 
will encounter higher upfront fees.
The plan represents a victory for 24 US and European airlines that cannot get export credit agency (ECA) loan 
guarantees themselves because they are based in countries where the big jetmakers manufacture aircraft. The 
little-known agreement, called the home country rule, affects airlines based in France, the UK, Germany, Spain and 
the US, where either Airbus or Boeing make aircraft.
The rules, which are intended to come into force as early as January once approved, will vary financing fees 
according to the credit rating of the airline and prevailing market conditions.
If the rules were in place today, airlines with strong credit profiles, such as Emirates and Ryanair, would have to pay 
nearly 8 per cent of the value of the debt raised to buy an aircraft, or roughly twice the current charge. They would 
also face lower loan-to-value ratios.
Many of these airlines, which also include Korean Air and Virgin Blue, last month announced they had formed a 
rival lobby group that backs an end to the home market rule, but opposed more expensive ECA financing.
Both sides have focused their efforts on negotiations for a new international aircraft financing deal that has been 
overseen over the past year by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Airlines face rise in cost of buying jets
The initial group of 24 US and European airlines have lobbied their respective governments about changing the 
rules for months, claiming they have been "profoundly threatened" by a "flood" of export credit backing for profitable 
and fast-growing foreign rivals.
This group has urged governments to impose less attractive terms on export credit support, which ballooned to 
record levels last year as commercial bank financing dried up in the credit crunch and became cheaper than 
commercial loans.
Their efforts have unsettled Boeing, which, like Airbus, has benefited from ECA support for leading airline 
customers.
While the steeper terms may not please large aircraft makers, others such as Canada's Bombardier, are eager to 
have the new agreement approved so they can leave what Marc Meloche, Bombardier's senior director of 
structured finance, describes as the "grey zone" of uncertainty about export financing rules that has existed in the 
absence of a new agreement.
He said negotiators had promised a conclusion by December 31 and it was expected this week's meeting would 
produce a result.
In addition, the general financing terms of ECA support, such as minimum interest rates and repayment of principal 
and interest, will be brought into line with what commercial banks and financiers charge.

Western airlines are trying to divert attention from their structural failings by deepening a dispute over the funding 
advantages of fast-growing Middle Eastern carriers, said James Hogan, chief executive of Abu Dhabi's Etihad 
Airways.
Mr Hogan's remarks hit back at Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways, who says European export credit 
agencies are unfairly subsidising the growth of airlines such as Etihad and Emirates.
Mr Hogan argued that this was misleading, saying western airlines were falling behind because of agreements with 
unions, outdated infrastructure and hubs that were poorly located to tap Asia's booming economies.
Some 24 US and European airlines complain they are hobbled by a rule, dating back to the 1980s, that countries 
where Boeing and Airbus build aircraft - the US, UK, France, Germany and Spain - cannot use export credit 
agencies to help their airlines buy passenger airliners. The western airlines want their governments to drop this so-
called home market rule, then put a 20 per cent cap on export financing for aircraft purchases and increase the 
costs of such funding.
"What European legacy carriers are doing here is muddying the water," Mr Hogan told the Financial Times in an 
interview in Seoul, to which Etihad is starting daily flights.
"Why do people such as ourselves have a competitive advantage? We are seven years old; we are not a legacy 
carrier. I am not bound by union agreements that may be 25 or 30 years old. I am not bound by infrastructure that 
may have been right for 30 years ago."
Etihad chief hits back over export financing feud
He added that western carriers were not adapting very quickly to building fleets for new hubs that focused on 
booming Asian economies.
"There's an economic shift. Whereas the European hubs were at the centre of the aviation world, today they are at 
the end of it," he said. "Their networks rely on feeding into London, Frankfurt or Paris. That's a competitive issue, a 
structural address. So address it. It is not to do with us getting a form of credit."
Mr Hogan said he was happy for western countries to drop the home market rule, levelling the field on export 
finance, but that he opposed the further restrictions proposed by western airlines. Etihad has joined nine other 
airlines including Ryanair, Emirates and Korean Air in forming the Aviation Alliance. This group is protesting at 
moves to put a cap on export financing and charge more for it. Mr Hogan said 15 per cent of his funding came from 
export credit. He said these agencies made the same "gruelling, strong" demands on his business plans as would 
normal banks.

From Mr Stephen Hazell-Smith.
Sir, May I put in a plea that you do not do to Philip Stephens ("Clegg learns the lessons of a breach of trust", 
December 7) the FT equivalent of Ryanair sending Captain Morgan Fischer to Lithuania?
You must regard as treasonous talk his temerity in writing that "there could scarcely be a better example of such 
inter-generational selfishness than reducing spending on education while protecting benefits for the affluent elderly" 
when the FT editorial line (also December 7) is that a vote to increase university fees is a vote to maintain Britain's 
world class education system.

The Ryanair pilot who said the airline should replace Michael O'Leary, the low-cost airline's chief executive, with a 
junior flight attendant to save money has quit after being reassigned from southern France to the "Siberia" of a base 
in Lithuania.
Captain Morgan Fischer was one of almost 30 Ryanair pilots working at Marseilles who had to move after the airline 
announced in October that it was closing the base in a disagreement with French authorities.
The pilots were asked to bid for new bases. Most did so and were offered work at bases in Spain, Italy,Portugal and 
elsewhere, including some a few hours' drive from Marseilles, where many live with their families.
Capt Fischer, who had worked for Ryanair for almost five years and had spent almost a year resolving a contractual 
dispute with the airline, said he wanted to discuss any move first, according to a close colleague.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
This was because he was concerned the low-cost carrier could treat a request to shift bases as an agreement to a 
new - and possibly inferior - contract.
The 41-year-old American, who lives with his family in the pretty town of Aix-en-Provence, was then offered a 
transfer to Kaunas, Lithuania's second-largest city.
Pilot who crossed O'Leary resigns
"That was a fairly considerable kick in the teeth for him," said the colleague. "Kaunas is considered Siberia for 
Ryanair pilots. It's very unpopular to be sent there. It's the back of nowhere with a completely different language. 
You're in eastern Europe and the money is dreadfully bad."
As a result, Capt Fischer resigned. He declined to comment but, speaking from France, his colleague said the pilot 
had the option of going back to work for a US airline.
Capt Fischer's resignation comes two months after he offered a cheeky riposte to Mr O'Leary's comments that 
airlines could save "a fortune" if flight attendants replaced co-pilots on aircraft now so sophisticated that "the 
computer does most of the flying".
In a letter to the Financial Times, Capt Fischer suggested his own idea to shave costs: replacing Mr O'Leary with a 
"probationary cabin crew member currently earning about EUR13,200 net a year".
Stephen McNamara, Ryanair's head of communications, said the airline could not comment on individual 
employees or their contracts for confidentiality reasons.
But he said fewer than 10 of the almost 30 pilots at Marseilles had not said where they would like to be transferred, 
"and so these have been offered transfers to other bases in Spain, Italy, the UK and Lithuania, according to where 
we have pilot vacancies".
He added: "All of our Marseilles pilots have been offered positions at other Ryanair bases, and the vast majority 
have already accepted these offers.
"Should some pilots choose not to, and resign, then much as we would regret such a decision, we would respect it 
and wish them every success with their future careers."

I nearly didn't make it to the Mayr Clinic. The sight of Heather Mills at the Ryanair check-in for my flight to 
Klagenfurt in Austria nearly made me turn tail. Though horrified, I wasn't at all surprised. Of course she would be 
there. A rigorous detox spa would suit someone with Heather's propensity for one-upmanship.
Her über-radiance caused my ambivalence about the trip to harden into resistance. I feared returning with the 
complacent glow of the global spa junkie. In a week's time, I'd be the one clutching the diet book with the aspect of 
someone who travels without experiencing.
The other Mayr guests were as relieved as I was when Heather and her lackies jumped into a taxi. Where could 
they be going? Every one of us in the transfer bus to the Mayr had a theory. Perhaps she was heading to the "other 
place" - a more glamorous Mayr clinic a few miles down Lake Wörthersee. Or having a party in one of the grand 
mansions around the Lake.
Their gossipy candour took me aback. These high-born English ladies spoke freely and loudly at just the pitch I 
would if people weren't forever telling me to "Shhh!". I hadn't expected people en route to a rest cure to be this 
animated.
The talk then moved to the physical and emotional benefits of the "Mayr and More" experience. I was the only first-
timer. Lady B asked what I was expecting from my week at the clinic. I told her I was expecting enlightenment, but 
not fun. I'd formed the impression that the "house" was cloaked in silence at all times. The ladies laughed heartily at 
this.
The ultimate stress test
I was told not to expect "slick". Unusually for a destination spa, the Mayr Clinic hasn't been "styled". Its English 
clients prefer it that way. Their selection of this homely option over "the other place" marked them out as persons of 
discrimination. "This is where the people of talent go," I was told, flatteringly.
The view from the window was reassuringly orderly. Neat Heidi houses abutted with logs cut to a uniform size. I 
fancied the fish in Lake Wörthersee might be similarly neat and uniform.
Jane C, a writer, asked what had motivated me to come, given that I wasn't apparently in need of losing weight. I 
explained that I was on a quest to de-stress.
"I'm not sure I understand what that word 'stressed' means," Jane said. "It's a catch-all term that's less useful than 
the words it replaced, the ones describing specific emotions. When people say they are stressed, I think they mean 
they are frustrated, angry or even   sad."
That long pause suggested there was something in Jane's recent past for which the word "stressful" was 
inadequate.
Jane's compassionate scepticism reminded me of the response my GP has when I self-diagnose. I wanted to 
assure her that my condition was neither a cultural construct nor a pseudo-medical fad. I hadn't got stress off the 
internet! While accepting that it might be hard to define precisely, stress feels as real to me as love.
. . .
My husband Tom works away a lot. His most recent month-long trip coincided with a series of domestic crises. I 
was, as usual, at least partly to blame for the dented car and broken dishwasher. I lay awake all night for three 
nights, stressing about how we're going to pay the credit card bill for the dishwasher on top of the one for our new 
mattress and bed, which together came to £3,000.
I felt guilty about the Tempur mattress, which hadn't aided restful sleep. My insomnia was, if anything, worse. I'd lie 
there sweating in the Tempur's slightly sinister microclimate, feeling like an idiot for spending all our holiday money 
on a de-stressing sleep "solution".
I'm embarrassed to admit that I was gulled by the manufacturer's claim that an hour's sleep on a Tempur equated to 
three in a normal bed. Yet the decision to ditch our perfectly good coil-sprung bed was understandable, if not 
excusable. We often hear that stressed people are poor decision-makers. The logical "brainy" part of the brain 
closes down, apparently. When this happens, we can only focus on survival goals, rather than long-term ones.
This describes my mindset in the bed store Warren Evans when I said, "I'll have that one." The survival goal - 
getting a night's sleep - had eclipsed the long-term goal of avoiding debt. I tried to explain to Tom that this luxury 
was a necessity. His perfectly functioning upper neocortex told him that it wasn't, logically. He told me there was no 
such thing as a "relaxing" bit of plastic.
I placed the order anyway. My defiance felt justified. I was acting defensively, believing stress was threatening my 
existence. Allison Pearson and other motherhood writers have portrayed it as maternal enemy number one, 
overtaking boredom and bad sex. Impressed by this analysis, I joined them in manically hyping stress up. Our 
campaign has been successful. There is now general agreement that the middle-class mother's life is more 
challenging than that of a global CEO.
For my generation of stressed-out working mothers, de-stressing has become a survival goal. Our need for 
lavender pillow sprays, relaxation CDs and upscale loungewear is urgent and immediate. Along with stressed chief 
executives, we are the biggest consumers of de-stressing products and services.
So we've drunk our de-stressing vitamin water and applied de-stressing eye cream with no visible effect. The next 
thing on the agenda is booking a spa "escape". We're spoilt for choice as there are estimated to be 50,000 spas 
worldwide. The success of this multi-billion-dollar global industry is a tribute to the spa marketers' skill at convincing 
us that de-stressing can only take place in a building designated for the purpose. According to them, this pseudo-
The ultimate stress test
religious rite can be performed in a converted hay barn or a stilted cabana in the middle of the Indian Ocean, but 
not a library or your front room.
If I'd been less stressed, I might have realised that there's no such thing as a "de-stressing" bit of architecture. 
When Tom returned from his trip, I foolishly tried to sell him the idea of my spa "escape" in terms borrowed from the 
reviews in Spa Secrets magazine. He'd barely put his suitcase down before I'd announced that I was desperate for 
some "me time".
When modern women dream about escaping our banal existences we fantasise, equally banally, about draping our 
carcasses in tepidaria where Grazia is the only reading material allowed. For us, relaxation means the 
decommissioning of body and mind. I wonder if the desire to de-stress is a death drive, and if so what that says 
about us. While our forebears yearned for excitement and expanded horizons, we long to be prone on tomb-like 
treatment tables.
I told Tom that a series of spa breaks was urgently needed: it would be the ideal way for me to de-stress. Nothing 
else had worked, had it? I'd never been to a spa, as I'd never fancied being "pampered". I did now, though. For the 
first time, the word resonated. I'd always thought it the preserve of silly women, yet now, the prospect of being 
infantilised seemed alluring rather than ridiculous. I was tired of looking after myself and happy to devolve 
responsibility for the task to trained professionals. With this in mind, I booked three spa "experiences" of different 
sorts.
I wasn't yet sure of my spa "type". Was I high or low church, in spa terms? I wanted to try everything, knowing this 
would be expensive. A sliver of "me time" would cost more than our family holiday. I told myself not to feel guilty. 
There was ample cultural evidence supporting my belief that "me time" is a necessity, not a luxury. The Radox 
"Selfish Hour" advertising campaign suggests that everyone around us benefits from our "selfish" hour: "When you 
feel happy it makes everyone around you feel happy too."
Although they might not see it, my selfish three weeks would benefit the whole family.
. . .
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
Breakfast at the Mayr was like Christmas in Albert Square. Everyone in the dining room looked somewhat the 
worse for wear. It's a cruel irony that detoxers look hungover. I attributed their extravagant bad temper to the 
synthetic duvets, until I remembered that none of us had eaten since lunchtime the previous day.
One new arrival, Mrs Blanchard Smythe, was explaining to the waitress how she liked her bacon cooked. Madame 
seemed not to be aware that bacon was not allowed. Not toast, nor locally sourced mushrooms. She could have tea 
or yoghurt. But not tea and yoghurt.
I craned my neck to see Mrs B S burst a gasket in a cartoonish way, knowing I'd replay the scene many times in my 
head in the coming days.
On the table to my left, old-timer Lady B was philosophical about the privations, but concerned about how this detox 
would impact on her physically. Last time, she'd had problems with her eyesight and couldn't read. I wasn't 
surprised to discover that massively reducing one's food intake while downing Epsom Salts might impact adversely 
on one's health.
To a burned-out businessman, of which there were several at the Mayr, the appeal of a detox is more visceral than 
scientific. The disquiet he feels contemplating his dirty body is the same as I feel contemplating my dirty house. He 
can't settle, much less work, when he thinks it's in need of a spring clean. When the job is completed, he feels 
relieved rather than relaxed.
The ultimate stress test
I'd never seen myself as internally dirty and couldn't imagine how I would cope if this perception shifted. I was 
concerned about what else would be revealed during my initial consultation with Dr Frank Bolvari, medical director 
and general manager of this celebrated wellness clinic.
In the accounts of its supporters, wellness is about potential. Wellness diagnostics assess how far the client's state 
of health deviates from his optimal condition. Clients are then assisted towards the highest state of wellbeing of 
which they are capable. They are encouraged to devise their own stratagem in pursuit of this goal. Since this 
commonly involves the renunciation of past pleasures, the quest for wellness is often cast as a moral crusade.
Like all wellness clinics, the Mayr proposes to find out what's wrong with you long before you've realised it yourself.
I didn't know what the diagnosis would be, but did know where, anatomically. From my reading, I knew that the 
original Dr Mayr - back in the 1920s - was obsessed with digestion, believing it to be the root of many 
unacknowledged ills.
The book I was given when I checked in - Health Through Inner Body Cleansing by Mayr disciple Dr Erich Rauch - 
contained diagrams of eight different belly shapes, only one of which was deemed "normal". The other seven are 
manifestations of undiagnosed disorders.
A laminated card on my table emphasised the importance of eating in a relaxed environment, free from distractions. 
But the combination of my obsessive reading and rereading of the instruction card and the awful mental images 
conjured by Dr Rauch's diagrams were far more distracting than the cacophony of my usual family breakfast.
To distract myself from these distractions, I attended a lakeside exercise session called "Active in the Morning" with 
Jane. In the changing room, I scanned my body for hints of abnormality. There was nothing amiss except my 
peeling nails and I could explain them.
My first spa experience, at Urban Retreat in Manchester, had tested the impact of beautification on my stress 
levels, with surprising results. In defiance of my feminist principles, I'd had my nails "done". I'd expected my acrylic 
nail extensions to look chipped and crappy after a couple of days, generating more stress.
Three-and-a-half weeks later, they were pristine, but I had cracked. They seemed to be mocking me, drawing 
attention to my deficiencies. My wardrobe wasn't good enough for them, nor my friends. I stressed in the way you 
do when you're going out with someone better-looking than you. Dumping them was no easy matter, sadly. The 
woman at the John Lewis nail bar said she'd never known acrylics to be so tenacious. They clung on like limpets in 
a chemical rockpool.
. . .
The lakeside exercise session did me good. I bounded into Bolvari's office. I'd never thought much about my 
digestion, but felt confident it would pass muster. My flat stomach was proof, surely, that I wasn't lying when I said I 
ate healthily.
I had underestimated the emotional force of Bolvari's concern. His expression when he tapped my stomach caused 
me to blush. He explained that I was deluded about my level of wellness. Compared with what it ideally should be, 
my flat stomach was bloated. He listened to it through a stethoscope, then asked me to listen. "What's it meant to 
sound like?" I asked, with my stress levels rising. Not that, clearly. Tests were ordered.
I was crestfallen. Bolvari's attraction level was perfectly calibrated for inspiring confidence. Any more attractive and 
I'd have disbelieved the diagnosis. Any less, and I'd have confidently challenged the Mayr's elitist model of 
"wellness". I was shocked at being labelled a digestive deviant. Bolvari's insistence that my malaise was common 
and easily remedied was little comfort to someone with body-fascistic tendencies. Unnerved by this revelation of 
internal imperfection, I decided I'd do whatever he deemed necessary to bring me back into line with this newly 
calibrated "ideal". A week on a restricted diet should do it, he said.
The ultimate stress test
The diet he suggested seemed more do-able than the tea fast proposed for those with weight problems. Egg and 
bread for breakfast, a boiled potato and soup for lunch, another bowl of soup for tea - "You won't starve on this."
On the way out, I risked a little flirtatious badinage with Bolvari's statuesque assistant, Barbara. The reception area 
where she was stationed was rickety and unreal, like the set on Doctors. The afternoon-TV aesthetic made us all 
feel that flirting with Barbara was artistically justified - that and the fact that she is glamorous but not "slick".
. . .
Two days later, I nearly killed the waitress who refused my request for an extra piece of bread. I'd been awake all 
night, wrestling with hunger pangs. I rushed to Bolvari, demanding more. He assented and put me on the 
"Regeneration 3 diet", which meant two courses at lunch and a piece of bread with my evening soup.
My promotion caused a great stir in the dining room. Like the prisoner who'd won privileges by devious means, I 
was envied and despised in equal measure. At first, I luxuriated in the sensation of being top dog. At lunchtime, 
Lady B and the rest gathered round my plate, gazing longingly at my sliver of pike. Then it all got a bit much. I 
banned them from taking photographs, suspecting that iPhone images of my apple strudel were being turned into 
food porn. Why didn't they all demand to be upgraded to Regeneration 3? I was sure Dr B wouldn't refuse them. 
They were suffering, weren't they? Lady B was experiencing a recurrence of the eye trouble that affected her on the 
last detox. Another lady was wracked with pain in her muscles. Starving can't be good for you, can it?
They listened to me intently, then returned to their tables. When I next looked, Lady B was gazing at the writing on 
her menu card as if it were a form of divine law. I felt frustrated, unable to grasp why my incitement to revolution 
had fallen flat.
I understand now. For some of these high-ranking ladies, surrendering their autonomy was the point. If, like Lady B, 
you could have anything you wanted, it must be rather thrilling to have something withheld for a circumscribed 
period. What looked like punishment to me was for them an exquisite and rarefied form of pampering.
For another category of patient, conceding to the body's demands would mean a loss of face. These macho 
detoxers spent hours reminiscing about the old days when there was no spelt bread, no yoghurt, no spoonful of 
honey in your herbal teas. The first few days of a tea fast were hell, they said, but after that it was euphoric, man.
Instead of euphoria, I was riven with envy during my week's stay at the Mayr. The woman sitting next to me in the 
dining room was my media doppelgänger. Her wardrobe was exactly what I'd have worn if I'd been rich. The only 
person I didn't envy was the woman with emphysema who couldn't leave her room.
I didn't sleep any better than at home. You can't lie in at the Mayr. Days begin early, at 7.30. We had a packed 
schedule of treatments, tests and consultations. I was tired. But how stressed was I?
Bolvari gave one answer   PE teacher Hannes gave another. His EKG machine pronounced me in a low percentile, 
stress-wise. I was indignant, feeling like I'd been robbed of the only thing that conferred status in this milieu. I didn't 
have a country pile, or an invitation to Alexander Lebedev's birthday party, but I did have lowered adrenal 
functioning, according to Dr B; as low as one of the burned-out businessmen.
Bolvari was able to account for the discrepancy. I was stressed - but well-adapted to cope with it. He still thought I'd 
benefit from some of the anti-stress treatments. Sadly, I wasn't adapted to deal with the stress of these hardcore 
"therapies".
The intravenous "laser blood irradiation therapy" was as scary as it sounds. Hooked up to this Soviet-era-like 
contraption, I decided this de-stressing service wouldn't be the one to market to the mothers back home.
On my last night, I asked Jane if I could borrow her gold and diamond knuckleduster ring. "I'll have to stop myself 
from giving it to you," she said. It looked very good with the Cavalli kaftan I'd borrowed from the woman with 
emphysema. The spoils of stress were everywhere. My media doppelgänger's gorgeous Prada Sport windcheater 
was a guilt gift from her stressed husband.
The ultimate stress test
My last hours were spent noting down the names of sleeping pills. My friends' suggestions were most welcome. If I 
slept better, I figured I'd find a way of turning my stress percentile into prizes. Picturing the journalist whose entire 
oeuvre is a paean to stress, I realised I'd been wrong to even contemplate getting rid of it. If I hung on to it, I'd have 
an excuse to come back and see Dr Bolvari.
At my final examination, he pronounced me half-cured. My stomach was flatter, but my stress levels were mercifully 
unaltered. He hoped I would come back and promised to offer me an excellent rate if I did.
. . .
Spas and their stressed subjects exist in a curious symbiosis. Who would want to de-stress when the rewards for 
not doing so include regular sojourns to an "indulgent" spa? I was glad I'd left my trip to one of these pampering 
"havens" until last. Post-Mayr, I definitely fancied going somewhere where I would be treated as an infallible 
customer rather than recalcitrant patient. You've earned it, everyone kept saying. But had I?
There was no lily pond in my treatment room at Pennyhill Park in Surrey. The global trend for hyperbolic luxury 
hadn't penetrated beyond the communal areas. Expecting über-glamour, I was surprised to find myself in a 
somewhat desexed version of a boutique hotel room, with brownish walls and a cheap-looking double bed. It looked 
as if they'd started theming it, then thought better of it. It wasn't their fault. What do you put in a treatment room? 
What is it, after all?
According to the Pennyhill blurb, the Li'Tya "Dreaming" treatment they offer reconnects the trinity of mind, body and 
spirit and unleashes your utmost potential; your dreaming.
At certain points during my Dreaming treatment I came close to feeling comfortable for the first time in my odyssey. 
The heated treatment table was wonderful. It had always seemed wrong that you couldn't lie on electric blankets 
when they were on. As the treatment progressed, the comfort penetrated through several layers, but not quite to my 
core. (Perhaps only drugs can do that.)
I stopped thinking, but couldn't quite stop being. That longed-for moment of "easeful death" - the ultimate spa 
indulgence - never came. The closer I came to it, the more I resented the occasional reminders of my humanity: the 
sting of the salty body rub in the cut in my little finger, the tickle in the back of my throat.
Therapist Lucy's presence was self-effacing in just the right measure. During my three hours with her, I didn't 
access some made-in-Surrey version of the Aboriginal dreamtime, but did gain some insight into what it would be 
like to be Cleopatra slathered in unguents from faraway continents.
When I went for a shower midway through the treatment, I was appalled to find no body wash. Lucy had left the 
room, and there was no panic button in the shower to summon her. I would have had a tantrum if I hadn't felt too 
silly, slathered head to toe in mud from the Australian outback.
Leaving Pennyhill Park in the dark, I was perturbed to find no chauffeured car waiting for me on the gravel drive. 
Back home, Tom said hello and carried on with his accounts. He didn't unpack my case, or offer to draw me a rose-
petal-strewn bath. After a couple of days of making my own cups of tea, I was longing again for some more "me 
time".
My selfish three weeks hadn't made me less selfish, but more so. For my family, it would have been better if I'd 
stayed at home and looked after them. New research suggests that altruism is the best remedy for stress. The fact 
that we spend so much of our "me time" doing the opposite suggests that we're not at all serious about de-
stressing.
Stress makes me feel important. That's why I don't want to let go of it, in spite of the fact that there's less excuse for 
it than there ever was. My moans about life are as unjustified as my moans about Pennyhill Park. My life is 
relatively easy. I'm not in sole charge of anyone. Like Allison Pearson, I have a nanny. My days contain vast 
tranches of "me time". If the trip has taught me anything, it's that stress is a luxury, not a necessity.
The ultimate stress test

Ryanair and Emirates have taken the unusual step of joining forces with eight other airlines as a multibillion-dollar 
row over aircraft financing starts to split the world's ­largest airlines into two rival camps.
The Irish budget airline and Dubai's Emirates normally shun industry alliances. But on Thursday they revealed they 
had teamed up with carriers such as Etihad of Abu Dhabi, Korean Air, Norwegian and Australia's Virgin Blue to 
block what they say are dangerous attempts to curb the use of export credit agency backing for passenger jet 
purchases.
"The real concern for us is how quickly this is moving, so we're stepping up our efforts to try to get more airlines on 
board to start lobbying against it," said Howard Millar, Ryanair finance director.
The new Aviation Alliance group is pitting itself against 24 US and European airlines, including Delta, British 
Airways, American Airlines and Lufthansa.
These airlines say it is not fair that an informal agreement known as the home country rule prevents them from 
obtaining export credit support to buy their aircraft on what they say are the "significantly cheaper" terms available 
to their rivals such as Emirates, Ryanair and others.
The home country rule, which dates back to the 1980s, prohibits countries where Boeing and Airbus aircraft are 
built - the US, Germany, France, the UK and Spain - from providing export credit agency backing to their own 
airlines to help them buy aircraft.
Airline financing rift deepens
The issue has become increasingly contentious since the credit crunch, when export credit support ballooned to 
unprecedented levels as banks and other traditional sources of aircraft financing retreated.
Willie Walsh, BA's chief ­executive, lashed out at the ­situation two months ago, ­saying it amounted to Europe 
"funding the expansion of ­Emirates".
BA and the other home country airlines want the home market rule to be scrapped; export credit support levels 
capped at 20 per cent of aircraft deliveries and the price of export credit financing to be raised.
The Aviation Alliance airlines say they would be happy to see the home market rule abolished, but argue caps and 
higher fees could be disastrous in another financial crisis.
"There would be certain airlines who simply couldn't finance aircraft without this facility," said Jim Callaghan, 
Etihad's general counsel.
The issue is coming to a head in talks on a new set of global rules due to be finalised by the end of this year 
through the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Negotiators have been focusing on raising up front fees for export financing, according to people familiar with the 
situation, but it is not clear if the home market rule will be scrapped.

From Mr Paul O'Kane.
Sir, Your report on the opening of Dublin airport's new passenger terminal ("Funereal gloom greets new Dublin 
terminal", November 20) contained a number of factual inaccuracies.
Terminal 2 is not three times over budget, nor is it two years late. The construction cost of Terminal 2 and its 
associated facilities is just over EUR600m, in line with the budget when the design for the project was launched.
When T2 received planning permission in August 2007, Dublin Airport Authority said T2 would open in April 2010. It 
opened last Friday, seven months behind schedule.
The statement that T2 "was built for an airport handling 12m passengers a year - but industry officials say it will be 
lucky to see 6m" is incorrect. Dublin airport handled 18.4m passengers in 2005, when plans for Terminal 2 began to 
be advanced. This year, it is expected that more than 18.5m passengers will use the airport. In its first full year of 
operation, Terminal 2 is expected to process close to 8m passengers.
The suggestion within the article by Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, that T2 is "a bankrupt property 
development" is untrue.
At the end of its last financial year, DAA had EUR635m in cash and EUR560m worth of undrawn borrowing 
facilities. Its net debt was EUR616m. Based on current expectations, the company is fully funded until 2014, and 
Standard & Poor's noted last month that its liquidity was "strong". DAA has already made a formal complaint to the 
Irish Stock Exchange in relation to Mr O'Leary's misleading statements about the company's finances.
Dublin airport's new terminal is not a white elephant
Terminal 2 was not state funded, as the report claims. DAA is state owned, but receives no exchequer funding. T2 
was funded through DAA's commercial revenues, aeronautical charges and borrowings.
Paul O'Kane,
Public Affairs Director,
Dublin Airport Authority,
Dublin, Ireland

Anxious parents will be able to keep track of teenagers as they travel round the world on a gap year, thanks to a 
new smartphone app. Gaptrac automatically logs the location of the traveller's phone handset and displays it on a 
website visible to selected followers. The app also comes with a "red alert" function - if a user presses the 5 key for 
three seconds, they are automatically connected to an emergency response centre. The creators say they hope to 
overcome teenagers' concerns about being monitored by their parents by marketing the system as a social media 
rather than purely safety tool. Travellers can upload videos, photos and stories about their trip. The subscription-
based service costs £10 ($16) a month.

British Airways is to launch flights from London to Marrakech from March 27 next year, in direct competition with 
rivals EasyJet and Ryanair. BA is keen to take on the low-cost carriers on such leisure routes, positioning itself as 
the "alternative for discerning travellers". Fares start at £80 one-way.

Can a budget business hotel cause an upset at the European Hotel Design Awards on Tuesday? The results of the 
awards will be unveiled at a ceremony at London's Lancaster hotel, and the shortlist includes many of the 
continent's grandest new and refurbished properties. Competing are the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona, the 
Athenaeum in London, the Grace in Santorini, the Palazzina Grassi in Venice - and the Park Inn in Manchester. 
Rooms at the Park Inn start at just £81 and the chain is known more for its airport locations than high design 
concepts. It is shortlisted in the "architecture of the year" category, and is the latest example of the "luxury budget" 
hotel trend.

The champagne was flowing but no one could describe the demeanour of Brian Cowen, Ireland's prime minister, as 
celebratory when he opened Ireland's largest construction project on Friday.
After a momentous week, with officials from the International Monetary Fund and European Union in Dublin to draw 
up a financial bail-out, Mr Cowen was on a rare public engagement - officiating at the formal opening of T2, Dublin's 
space age airport terminal.
An award-winning design, this EUR600m ($820m) state-funded project at one time employed 2,500 construction 
workers.
In better times it would have been a good news story. But after what Eamon Gilmore, Labour party leader, dubbed 
"the blackest week since the Irish civil war", even Mr Cowen's speechwriters found it hard to envision the sunny 
uplands.
"T2 was designed and built not just for this year or the next, but for many decades into the future. To view it through 
the prism of the current downturn would be short-sighted in the extreme," Mr Cowen told the audience of ministers, 
ambassadors and leading Irish business figures.
T2 was meant to be a symbol of Ireland's modern, outward-looking economy - but now it is in danger of becoming 
yet another example of the overblown optimism of the Celtic Tiger years.
The project was three times over budget and two years behind schedule. It was built for an airport handling 12m 
passengers a year but industry officials say it will be lucky to see 6m. The Dublin Airport Authority, the state body 
Gloom greets opening of Dublin terminal
that owns the facility, has been saddled with huge debts to finance the project and is facing claims by unpaid 
subcontractors, who staged a protest at the airport on Friday.
But as Niall Givens, chief executive of Tourism Ireland, put it: "There is no point in denying there are big debt 
issues. At the end of the day its here. We have to get on with it by sweating the assets as best we can."
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair and arch-critic of the project and Dublin Airport Authority, was typically 
excoriating.
"This a fitting tribute to the state of our economy. We have a big bankrupt property development out here run by a 
bunch of incompetent civil servants and bureaucrats," he said, dressed in top hat and tails - the traditional costume 
for a country undertaker in Ireland to underline his view that this was no celebration.
Describing it as a EUR1.2bn Irish Taj Mahal, Mr O'Leary claimed the DAA was raising airport charges by 40 per 
cent - when inflation is close to zero - to defray the costs of the investment.
"It will provide a nice welcoming lounge for the IMF officials that come here and will be a reminder every time they 
come through of why Ireland is broke," he added.
Never one to miss a publicity stunt, he had earlier arrived in a hearse, accompanied by pall bearers carrying a coffin 
draped in the green, white and orange of the Irish tricolour.
One British business traveller arriving on the inaugural flight from Manchester welcomed the airport: "It's nice to 
have a new terminal and something positive to talk about in Ireland with everything going on."
But the Irish were in no mood to look on the bright side. "I suppose they're getting it ready for all the young people 
trying to emigrate," said William Humphries, a Dublin taxi driver sitting in the long queue at the old terminal.
T2 may indeed witness an increasing flow of emigrants in the next few years at least, with the Economic and Social 
Research Institute predicting that net emigration will almost double in 2011 from 34,000 to 60,000.
"Every time I hear people talking about it I get the shivers," says Kevin McDermott, who runs mylocalnews.ie, a 
community bulletin board.
"I can see the 1980s all over again. I graduated in 1987 and no one in my class stayed. I can see the same thing 
happening today."

EasyJet has decided to pay dividends for the first time, following more than a year of lobbying for such pay-outs 
from Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, its founder and largest shareholder.
The news came as Europe's second largest low-cost airline on Tuesday reported it had nearly tripled its annual 
profits, joining the global aviation resurgence that has seen carriers around the world rebound strongly after the 
economic downturn.
Carolyn McCall, the 15-year-old airline's new chief executive, also announced a strategy to attract more business 
travellers with a new type of fare that will give passengers unlimited flexibility to change their flight up to two hours 
before scheduled departure times.
Passengers booking the new fares will get automatic speedy boarding, no booking fees and a checked-in hold bag 
at no extra cost.
EasyJet, one of few airlines in Europe to report an annual profit last year, said that given its ability to generate cash 
and access reasonably priced finance, the board had decided on a formula that would trigger a dividend payment in 
years it was profitable.
The yearly payment would be based on a dividend cover of five times, and the first would be made in 2012, based 
on the year ending September 30 2011.
EasyJet plans debut dividend as profits jump
EasyJet's move is likely to please Sir Stelios, who quit the airline's board in May to become a self-described 
"shareholder activist", fighting what he claimed was a management strategy of "relentless growth in aircraft 
numbers" and urging instead a profit margin increase.
The move puts EasyJet in line with Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, which decided earlier this year to make 
its first dividend payment since it was floated nearly more than a decade earlier.
Ryanair, however, elected to pay a one-off special dividend of EUR500m, rather than the annual pay-outs that 
EasyJet has chosen.
The dividend payment is the second move EasyJet has made recently to improve soured relations between the 
airline and Sir Stelios.
Last month it signed a branding deal to settle a two-year row that could see Sir Stelios receive close to £100m in 
the first 10 years of the 50-year agreement, depending on how much money EasyJet makes.
Some analysts have been concerned that the deal, on top of EasyJet's well-publicised summer airport operational 
disruptions, could put pressure on the airline's costs.
The carrier reported on Tuesday that its total underlying cost per seat had risen 5.2 per cent in the 12 months to the 
end of September, mainly driven by disruption caused by April's volcanic ash cloud airspace closures, weather 
related costs and its own operational difficulties over summer.
All these problems amounted to a £97.9m increase over the previous year.
Even excluding these problems, however, underlying cost per seat rose by 2.2 per cent.
Pre-tax profits rose to £154m from £54.7m last year. Revenues increased 11.5 per cent to £2.9bn while passenger 
numbers went up nearly 8 per cent to 48.8m.
Shares in EasyJet were little changed in early London trading, up 1.1p at 473.3p.

Sir Stelios, who quit the airline's board in May to become a self-described "shareholder activist", fighting what he 
claimed was a management strategy of "relentless growth in aircraft numbers" and urging instead a profit margin 
increase, said the dividend payment was "a good first step".
"The new management team has made some positive moves towards creating some real shareholder value," he 
said. "The decision to pay a dividend, in particular, represents a welcome change from the old regime, which 
seemed to place the interests of suppliers above those of shareholders. This is a good first step but I would like to 
see the dividend payout ratio increased over time to 50% of earnings per share."
The move puts EasyJet in line with Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, which decided earlier this year to make 
its first dividend payment since it was floated nearly more than a decade earlier.
Ryanair, however, elected to pay a one-off special dividend of EUR500m ($679m), rather than the annual pay-outs

numbers went up nearly 8 per cent to 48.8m.
"The results are in line with expectations but there's some evidence of underlying cost pressure", said Douglas 
McNeill, transport analyst at Charles Stanley Securities.
Shares in EasyJet, which have been strong performers over recent weeks, shed 4 per cent in afternoon London 
trading, down 19.1p at 453p.

Parents normally expect their offspring to do better than they did. But there is something slightly indecent about the 
speed with which Tiger Airways has surpassed its creator. Since the budget carrier was spun out of Singapore 
Airlines in January, its shares have outperformed SIA's by 13 per cent. In a world of crimped corporate travel 
budgets, it is becoming hard to distinguish the rough-and-tumble price-cutter from the premium-led operator.
Take passenger revenues per available seat kilometre, or RASK. (ASK is a measure of capacity: the number of 
seats available multiplied by the number of kilometres flown.) In Tiger's case, RASK weakened from 6.4 cents in the 
first quarter to 6.1 in the second. That is as it should be: the raison d'être of a budget airline is to find ways to push 
fares lower. But for SIA, the decline was much steeper. First-half results published late on Tuesday showed that 
RASK was down from 13.4 cents to 10.9 between the first and second quarters. No one disputes that SIA has some 
of the world's best cabins and lounges. It is just that customers are increasingly unwilling - or unable - to pay for 
them.
The world's second biggest carrier by market capitalisation is still a must-own. SIA's 2 per cent average return on 
equity over the past five years is a badge of distinction, when set alongside the global industry average (-22 per 
cent). But in Asia as elsewhere, the future for budget looks brighter than for premium. Qantas' Jetstar, for example, 
in its sixth successive year of double-digit growth, has posted three times higher underlying earnings before interest 
and tax than its parent over the past two years. European budget carrier Ryanair was more profitable (at the 
operating level) in its latest financial year than any other major airline. SIA's decision to hold on to a third of Tiger 
looks a smart one.

The chief executive of Aer Lingus said the Irish airline was on track to achieve its first annual profit for three years, 
after slashing long-haul capacity and cutting its Dublin-based workforce.
Christoph Mueller said that full-year results would be "at the upper end of consensus forecasts".
Goodbody stockbrokers are looking for pre-tax profits of EUR31m (£27m, $43m) for the year to December 31, 
compared with a loss of EUR66m in 2009 before an EUR89m exceptional restructuring charge related to the 
airline's cost reduction programme.
For 2011, Goodbody is forecasting pre-tax profits of EUR74m driven by a EUR35m reduction in the cost base as a 
result of staff cuts and other reforms.
Mr Mueller was reporting results for the third quarter to September 30 with operating profits of EUR60.2m compared 
with a EUR34.4m loss in the same nine-month period last year.
Revenues for the quarter were 5.5 per cent ahead, despite an 11.7 per cent reduction in capacity, following cuts in 
its transatlantic and Gatwick operations.
The airline, which has been the subject of two unsuccessful takeover bids by Ryanair, its Irish rival, said the 
improvement was driven by a 12.5 per cent increase in revenue per passenger.
Third-quarter short-haul revenues increased almost 5 per cent to EUR249.3m while long-haul revenues were ahead 
by 7.7 per cent to EUR97.9m.
Aer Lingus ready to return to black
Operating costs for the year-to-date were 9.2 per cent lower than the same period in 2009, on the back of a 13.7 
per cent reduction in staff costs after a fifth of the workforce were cut.
The airline's reduced service led to reduced fuel costs, which were a fifth lower than the comparable nine months of 
2009.
Mr Mueller said the former state-owned airline, in which the Irish government retains a 25.4 per cent strategic stake, 
was more than half way to achieving the EUR97m of targeted annual savings under its so-called "greenfield" 
restructuring programme.
He said that most of the remaining savings would be achieved through the reorganisation of back office functions.
With little growth in the Irish economy, analysts anticipate yield improvements slowing down. Airport charges in 
Dublin and London are also rising.
Mr Mueller expressed caution about the outlook "given concerns about the recent aviation sector performance as 
well as continuing economic uncertainty in our primary markets".
The company is trading on a prospective price earnings multiple of nine times, making it one of the cheapest airline 
stocks.
The shares closed down 6 cents at EUR1.11 on Friday. This compared with a historic low of 45 cents in mid 2009 - 
and the original Ryanair bid price of EUR2.80 a share in October 2006 which was rejected by the Irish government.

In a week in which the stock market hit its highest levels since the world's financial-system meltdown in 2008, 
Economy Watch is feeling a warm, fuzzy glow.
And that's not all. A closely watched survey of employers in the UK's services sector reported rising demand for the 
second month in a row while a similar review of the manufacturing sector showed output rising month on month. 
Even better, manufacturers' employment intentions accelerated at the fastest rate since 1995.
The good news is making itself felt in corporate results. Both Stagecoach and FirstGroup reported improved profits 
from increased passenger numbers as more commute to work. Ryanair said rising passenger numbers and air 
fares helped its profits, proving that consumers still have discretionary income. And John Lewis, purveyor to 
Britain's middle classes, said that the last week of October - as half-term week, this is the best guide to Christmas 
sales - saw a strong boost after a few weeks of tepid sales rises.
In fact, the general outlook appears so positive that the UK's interest rate setters at the Bank of England passed up 
the opportunity to give another boost to demand - unlike their counterparts at the US Federal Reserve. Corporate 
insolvencies continue to fall, although personal bankruptcies are close to record levels.
Alas, the full picture is not so simple. While Economy Watch focuses on events in Britain, we cannot ignore, for 
instance, the impact of soaring prices of commodities produced elsewhere. This week, crude oil hit a six-month 
high, gold prices set a new record and prices are soaring for a range of agricultural products, from wheat to cotton.
How does this affect us? The prices of goods leaving the factory gate jumped in October by much more than 
expected; those made with petroleum leapt highest. Next, the fashion chain, warned that higher cotton prices meant 
Jobs outlook chills market glow
clothes would cost more by early next year. Unilever, which produces a range of household goods, issued a similar 
warning. Morrisons, the supermarket chain, reported subdued sales and warned of more pressure on consumers 
next year.
Customers, too, are feeling the pinch. Imperial Tobacco benefited from customers trading down to roll their own.
A closely watched house-price index was up for the month but only enough partially to offset a record loss in 
September. Lloyds Banking Group conceded that the rising costs of raising money for itself has eaten into its 
profits.
Moreover, the bad news may just be beginning. A respected independent institute said that fierce spending cuts 
over the next six years were likely to lead to higher job losses in the private sector than in the public sector. The 
private sector needed to create 1.6m jobs just to keep unemployment where it was now.
Economy Watch is still enjoying the warm glow of a resurgent stock market. But rising prices and increasing job 
losses may mean we have less to spend in months ahead.

Continued growth in passenger numbers and an increase in fares has buoyed revenues at Ryanair, prompting the 
low-cost airline to raise its full year earnings estimate above the top end of its previous range.
However, signs emerged of a relative slowdown in the airline's ancillary revenues, the hitherto fast-growing 
business that includes non-ticket items such as baggage check, travel insurance and onboard snacks.
Ryanair said that due to higher-than-expected yields - or average fare levels - in the third quarter, it is now 
forecasting full-year net profit of between EUR380m and EUR400m ($560m), up from its previous forecast range of 
between EUR350m and EUR375m.
Shares in Ryanair fell 6 cents, or 1.5 per cent, to EUR4.07 in early trading on Monday.
In the six months to September, Ryanair carried 40.1m passengers, up 10 per cent from the 36.4m it carried in the 
same period last year. Average fares rose by 12 per cent in the period to EUR44 and total revenue per passenger - 
including ancillary revenues - also rose 12 per cent.
For the half-year ending in September, pre-tax profit increased by 15 per cent from to EUR483m on revenues that 
rose 24 per cent from to EUR2.2bn. Earnings per share rose from 25.21 cents to 28.31 cents.
Ryanair launched a base at El Prat airport in Barcelona in September and will launch bases in Valencia and Seville 
in November.
Ryanair lifts full-year earnings estimate
Ryanair's ancillary revenues grew by 22 per cent to EUR424m, but revenues from ticket sales grew slightly faster at 
24 per cent to EUR1.8bn. This marks a change in the fortunes of Ryanair's ancillary revenue stream, which for 
several years has grown much faster than ticket sales.
In the same six-month period last year, ancillary revenues grew by 8 per cent, while ticket revenues fell 5 per cent. 
In the same period in 2008,  ancillary revenues grew by 28 per cent, twice the rate of growth of ticket sales.
Analysts were broadly enthusiastic about the results.
"After three years of declines we expect average fares to recover strongly in the coming years on the back of a 
strengthening revenue environment," said Geert Zonneveld at Panmure Gordon in a note to investors.
"Combined with a deceleration (and eventual standstill) in capacity growth, we believe this should translate into 
attractive and sustainable profit growth over the medium term."

Ryanair became the latest airline to upgrade its annual earnings forecasts after posting a healthy profit for the six 
months to the end of September.
The Dublin-based airline says it now expects to make a full-year net profit of between EUR380m and EUR400m 
($555m), up from its previous predictions of between EUR350m and EUR375m.
Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have also upgraded their annual forecasts in recent weeks, while British Airways 
and Iberia last week bounced back into profit after recording steep losses during the 2008-2009 downturn that 
savaged airline earnings round the world.
Ryanair said it had made a pre-tax profit of EUR483m, up from EUR419 for the same period a year ago, as 
passenger numbers continued to increase and average fares rose by 12 per cent in the summer to EUR44.
But its results for the busy third-quarter summer months, traditionally the most profitable for European airlines, did 
not meet some analysts' forecasts and its shares were down 3.9 per cent by the close.
Analysts were broadly positive about the results, however, which showed half-year revenues rising 24 per cent to 
EUR2.2bn. Earnings per share rose from 25.21 cents to 28.31 cents.
"After three years of declines we expect average fares to recover strongly in the coming years on the back of a 
strengthening revenue environment," said Geert Zonneveld at Panmure Gordon in a note to investors.
Ryanair lifts full-year earnings estimate
"Combined with a deceleration (and eventual standstill) in capacity growth, we believe this should translate into 
attractive and sustainable profit growth over the medium term."
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the airline was still on track to record 73.5m passengers for the full 
year, a figure that will dwarf that of many of its older rivals such as British Airways, though they fly passengers 
further.
Mr O'Leary said he expected average fares to rise over the next year as well, in part because consolidation among 
rival airlines led them to raise their ticket prices. But he said Ryanair's fares would remain well below competitors, 
including its closest budget rival, EasyJet, which reports its full-year results on November 16.
He said he expected baggage fees would also increase as part of Ryanair's deliberate policy of trying to discourage 
its passengers from taking too much heavy luggage.
"The charges are to change passenger behaviour," he said.
He agreed that signs of a relative slowdown in the airline's ancillary revenues, which includes baggage fees, travel 
insurance, onboard snacks and other non-ticket items, showed some passengers were changing the way they flew.

The German government on Monday called on the international community to work together in drawing tougher 
security rules for air freight following the discovery of two US-bound bombs on commercial aircraft last week.
As the government convened a series of meetings to respond to the new terrorist threat, a spokesman said Berlin 
hoped the necessary tightening could be worked out at European Union level and in co-operation with the US.
The appeal came as David Cameron, the British prime minister, chaired a meeting of Cobra, the government's 
emergency planning committee, to discuss whether tougher checks on air freight could be imposed by the UK.
The details of the UK government response will be set out by Theresa May, the home secretary, to British 
lawmakers later on Monday, though officials said she would "not be rushing to any conclusions" about what 
measures might be put in place and was aware of the need to liaise closely with freight companies and airport 
operators.
Michael O'Leary, the outspoken chief of Ryanair, a European budget airline, warned against the introduction of 
more "ludicrous and useless" aviation security. "You have meetings of Cobra because some people want to be 
seen to be doing something," he said.
Any action taken by the UK on freight traffic would need to be agreed by international partners, with European 
support particularly important.
Germany calls for airline security unity
The German call for harmonised rules reflect Berlin's belief that global transport can only be as safe as its weakest 
link, but also its fear that reduced security - and thus lower costs - elsewhere could hamper Germany's many 
exporters.
Germany on Monday joined the US, the UK and France in stopping direct air traffic to and from Yemen after bombs 
were found in air-freight shipments from that country addressed to two synagogues in the US, triggering a global 
security alert.
One of the explosive packages was picked up while in the cargo hold of a passenger aircraft at Dubai airport, while 
the other one was intercepted aboard a freight-only plane at East Midlands airport in the United Kingdom.
Questions have been asked about why British police declared the printer safe after an initial take, only to go back to 
it after a similar device in Dubai was confirmed as containing explosives.
German airports handle around 350,000 tonnes of air freight and air mail a month, almost twice the volume seen at 
UK airports.
Frankfurt is home to Europe's largest cargo airport and global gateway for many German exports, while Cologne-
Bonn is a hub for US express-delivery service UPS and Leipzig airport is DHL's biggest regional base.
The association of German airports called for a "detailed analysis" of the incidents before new rules were agreed. 
"Over-hasty conclusions and snap judgments are not going to help anyone," its president Ralph Biesel said.
However, the German government said it was considering whether flights from other countries should be banned. 
Interior minister Thomas de Maizière said "relatively little" air-freight was currently checked for explosives.

The British government on Monday introduced emergency restrictions on air freight as other countries considered 
their response to last week's discovery of two bombs on board cargo jets bound for the US.
Theresa May, the UK home secretary, said she was suspending all unaccompanied air freight traffic from Somalia, 
banning air passengers from carrying printer cartridges larger than 500g in hand luggage and stopping the shipping 
of cartridges by air from unapproved sources via or from the UK.
The two explosive devices were discovered inside printer cartridges at the UK's East Midlands airport and in Dubai 
after tip-offs to the intelligence services. The packages were bound from Yemen to the addresses of synagogues in 
Chicago.
The British moves came as the German government called on the international community to work together in 
drawing up tougher security rules for air freight.
Ms May confirmed that Britain believed "that the [devices] were made and dispatched by the organisation known as 
al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula" - though she said there was no evidence of any further imminent attacks from 
the region.
US officials are leaning towards the belief that the mobile phone detonators in the bombs would have been used as 
timers, so it would not have been necessary for them to be within range of a terrorist to explode the devices.
The German call for harmonised rules reflect Berlin's belief that global transport can only be as safe as its weakest 
link, but also its fear that reduced security - and thus lower costs - elsewhere could hamper Germany's many

exporters. It is a fear shared by other European governments who have come under pressure from domestic 
businesses not to react to the bomb plot with a knee-jerk reaction.
Air freight from Yemen to the UK has already been banned but Ms May said she had decided to do the same for 
Somalia "based on possible contact between al-Qaeda in Yemen and terrorist groups in Somalia, as well as 
concern about airport security in Mogadishu". Germany also yesterday banned freight traffic from Yemen.
Ms May said the printer cartridge ban would be in place for at least a month to give the government time to "work 
closely with the aviation industry, screening equipment manufacturers and others, to devise a sustainable, 
proportionate, long-term security regime to address the threat".
Prior to the announcement Michael O'Leary, the outspoken chief of Ryanair, a European budget airline, had warned 
against the introduction of more "ludicrous and useless" aviation security. "You have meetings of Cobra [the UK 
government's emergency planning committee] because some people want to be seen to be doing something," he 
said
The UK transport ministry is already in talks with the industry to discuss what steps can be taken. The question will 
now arise as to whether other countries will introduce similar bans.
Any tightening of security rules is likely to focus on improved screening of large parcel companies' express freight 
businesses, rather than the regular movements of high-value goods as part of the global supply chain.
Components such as computer chips, computers and other manufactured goods tend to move on a "known 
shipper" basis, David Lara, a senior air freight executive for Netherlands-based Ceva Logistics, said. Such long-
term customers gave logistics providers 24 hours' notice of any goods movements and provide operators with 
assurances about the security of their supply chain.
"If you're IBM and you're shipping computers manufactured in Asia to the US or various parts of Europe and you're 
shipping two, five or 10 tonnes at a time, these are the organisations that already have all the security programmes 
and procedures in place," Mr Lara said.
However, it is likely to be far harder to extend those security measures to the express freight business, where UPS, 
Fedex, DHL and others gather small quantities of parcels and other freight from the public.

The German auto sector gained in a flat European market on Monday on speculation that third-quarter results from 
BMW would beat forecasts.
Frankfurt-listed manufacturer BMW was up 2 per cent to EUR52.58 as investors anticipated Wednesday's results 
would be as strong as other luxury carmakers Audi and Mercedes were last week.
Continental, the German car parts maker, rose 3.6 per cent to EUR65.34 although Volkswagen failed to gain, down 
1.7 per cent to EUR106.20.
The Xetra Dax gained 0.3 per cent to 6,623.71, while France's CAC 40 was flat at 3,836.31. The FTSE Eurofirst 
300 was also flat at 1,087.14.
The index was buoyed by London-listed miners which gained as metals prices rose on the back of strong Chinese 
manufacturing data and a weakening dollar.
"Asian markets have found some support off the back of upbeat Chinese manufacturing data as the new month 
gets under way. This is paving the way for a stronger start in Europe," said Ben Potter, research analyst at IG 
Markets
Weak-than-expected earnings results from across Europe, however, ensured any gains were capped.
Speculation boosts BMW in flat European market
Ryanair was down 3.8 per cent to EUR3.97 after posting worse than expected profit increases. Europe's biggest 
low-cost airline posted a 25 per cent increase in second-quarter net profits, but failed to reach the 40 per cent 
increase many were expecting.
TNT, the Dutch postal and express delivery business, was down 3.2 per cent to EUR18.49, a 12-month low, after 
reporting worse than expected results due to pension and restructuring costs.
Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone handset maker, fell 2.5 per cent to EUR7.57 after the director of Germany's IPCom 
said it was confident of winning its long patent fight to stop Nokia selling in key German markets after rulings last 
week.
Spain's Banco Popular fell 2.8 per cent to EUR4.52 after Nomura cut its price target to EUR4.50 from EUR5.90 and 
kept its "reduce" rating. Last week, Spain's third-biggest listed bank reported lower third-quarter profits as higher 
bad loan provisions undermined earnings.

European banking stocks fell sharply in a broadly flat market hit by growing concerns that future sovereign bail-outs 
in Europe would force private investors to bear more of the financial burden.
Late last week, European leaders agreed to discuss new regulations that would force investors to shoulder more 
responsibility in any rescue packages, increasing the risk of investing in already-sensitive banks in Spain, Italy and 
Greece.
"The decision by European leaders to agree a mechanism that might lead to private investors bearing a greater 
brunt of the pain in another Eurozone sovereign debt crisis has done some damage to the more risky European 
banks," said Michael Hewson at CMC Markets.
In Spain, Santander fell 3 per cent to EUR8.95 while BBVA lost 3.6 per cent to EUR9.11. Bankinter dropped 2.6 per 
cent to EUR4.66 while Banco Popular lost 3.2 per cent to EUR4.50.
Elsewhere in the periphery, bellwether National Bank of Greece fell 4.6 per cent to EUR7.51 while in Italy, UniCredit 
shed 3.6 per cent to EUR1.80, Mediobanca lost 1.7 per cent to EUR7.32 and Intesa Sanp Paolo fell 1.8 per cent to 
EUR2.49.
These losses dragged on the banking sector as a whole. Société Générale gave up 1 per cent to EUR42.60 while 
Natixis fell 0.8 per cent to EUR4.37.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 edged up 0.1 per cent to 1,088.01, supported by positive manufacturing figures from the 
US and China.
Banks fall on bail-out burden concerns
In Portugal, the successful completion of an austerity budget for 2011 lifted the market, with motorway operator 
Brisa up 3.7 per cent to EUR5.64 and telecommunications group Sonaecom up 2.8 per cent to EUR1.67. Portugal's 
PSI 20 index gained 0.5 per cent to 8,121.28.
Jeronimo Martins, the Portuguese retailer, jumped 4.7 per cent to EUR11.29 after the budget failed to include a 
VAT hike on basic foodstuffs. The German carmaking sector gained broadly amid speculation that third-quarter 
results from BMW, due on Wednesday, would beat forecasts.
BMW shares rose 2.8 per cent to EUR52.96.Continental, the German car parts maker, rose 3.6 per cent to 
EUR65.35 although Volkswagen missed the party as it dropped 2.7 per cent to EUR105.05.
Individual stocks were hit by disappointing earnings results. Ryanair fell 3.8 per cent to EUR3.97 after reporting a 
weaker-than-expected profit increase. Europe's biggest low-cost airline unveiled a 25 per cent increase in second-
quarter net profits, but failed to reach the 40 per cent gain the market was hoping for.
TNT, the Dutch postal and express delivery business, fell 4.2 per cent to EUR18.30, a 12-month low, after reporting 
worse-than-expected results due to pension and restructuring costs.
Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone handset maker, fell 2.6 per cent to EUR7.56 after the director of Germany's IPCom 
said that after a ruling last week it was confident of winning its patent fight to stop Nokia selling in key German 
markets.
But there was good news for German pharmaceutical company Bayer, which rose 1.1 per cent to EUR54.23 after a 
study found their stroke prevention drug worked.
Swiss cement maker Holcim gained 2.8 per cent to SFr63.05 as sector rival ACC, India's second-largest cement 
producer, said shipments in October had risen by 13.6 per cent on the previous year.
Telenor, the Norwegian telecommunications group, gained 2.9 per cent to NKr97.20 after Barclays Capital 
upgraded it to "overweight" from "equal weight".

Ryanair's 30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus is to be the subject of a competition investigation in the UK, it was 
announced on Friday, more than four years after the budget airline took a stake in the carrier.
The unusual move by Britain's Office of Fair Trading led to a strident rejection by Ryanair of the legal case for any 
investigation. Ryanair argued that subsequent decisions by European courts and the four-year time gap that had 
elapsed since it bought its stake in 2006 meant the OFT no longer had jurisdiction over the case.
In a statement, the OFT said that it was investigating the 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, the Irish national carrier, 
held by Ryanair. The OFT investigation will first seek to ascertain whether it has jurisdiction over the matter, and if 
so, whether the Ryanair stake allows it to exercise "material influence" over Aer Lingus.
Shares in Ryanair fell 0.8 per cent or 3 cents to EUR4.16 in early trading, and shares in Aer Lingus fell 0.9 per cent 
or 1 cent to EUR1.14.
Ryanair first took a stake in Aer Lingus in October 2006, after a "dawn raid" on the shares of its fellow Dublin-based 
airline. By the following month, the group held a 19 per cent stake in Aer Lingus and had launched an ultimately 
unsuccessful takeover bid for the carrier. Ryanair continued building its stake and by September 2007, it held 
almost 30 per cent of its rival's shares.
The European Commission prohibited the takeover bid in June 2007, but did not order Ryanair to divest its holding 
in Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus subsequently appealed against this decision, but in July of this year, the European 
General Court ruled Ryanair did not need to divest its stake in the airline. It was following this July decision that the 
OFT decided to launch its inquiry into the 2006 merger.
OFT to investigate 2006 Air Lingus-Ryanair deal
"We are surprised at this OFT query into a failed merger offer between two non UK companies, some four years 
after the offer, and some three years after the EU Commission has investigated and confirmed that Ryanair has no 
de jure or de facto control over Aer Lingus," said Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair in a statement.
"We have asked our lawyers to liaise directly with the OFT to bring this out-of-time and unnecessary query to an 
early conclusion. Ryanair also calls on the OFT to close these queries without delay, and without wasting time or 
resources on what is clearly a non-existent issue over which the OFT clearly no longer has any jurisdiction."
While Ryanair contests the jurisdiction of the OFT to rule on merger activity between two non-UK companies, much 
of the legal dispute is likely to centre on the issue of timing.
The OFT is ordinarily required to initiate investigations within four months of the merger's completion or within four 
months of new facts arising about the merger. However, the law permits the OFT to act beyond this four month limit 
in the event that European-level investigations precluded the OFT's ability to investigate earlier. Thus, under the 
law, the four-month limit only applies from the moment a European regulatory investigation ends.
The OFT is therefore arguing that it was precluded from acting on the Ryanair stake up until July of this year, when 
the European General Court rejected the Aer Lingus appeal. However, Ryanair argues that nothing precluded the 
OFT from initiating an investigation into its stake in Aer Lingus in the four month period after the European 
Commission ruling in June 2007, and while the Aer Lingus appeal was still current.
"Such prohibition [on the OFT launching an investigation into Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus] was in place until the 
European Commission's prohibition decision of June 2007 but not while the appeal of that decision to the EU's 
General Court was ongoing," Ryanair said in a statement.

Ryanair's 30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus is to be the subject of a preliminary competition investigation in the UK, 
more than four years after the budget airline took a stake in the carrier.
The unusual move by Britain's Office of Fair Trading drew a strident rejection from Ryanair of the legal case for any 
investigation.
Ryanair argued that subsequent decisions by European courts and the four-year time gap that had elapsed since it 
bought its stake in 2006 meant the OFT no longer had jurisdiction over the case.
The OFT said that it was investigating the 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, the Irish national carrier, held by 
Ryanair.
The OFT investigation will first seek to ascertain whether it has jurisdiction over the matter, and if so, whether the 
Ryanair stake allows it to exercise "material influence" over Aer Lingus.
Ryanair first took a stake in Aer Lingus in October 2006 and subsequently launched a takeover bid for the carrier 
that was prohibited by the European Commission in 2007. However, the commission did not require Ryanair to 
divest its shares.
An appeal by Aer Lingus seeking to force Ryanair to divest its stake was rejected in July this year by the European 
General Court.
It was following this decision that the OFT decided to launch its inquiry into the Ryanair stake.
Ryanair cries foul over OFT inquiry
While Aer Lingus welcomed the OFT's decision, Ryanair said the delay and the decisions by both the commission 
and the court meant that the OFT no longer had jurisdiction in the case.
Ordinarily, the OFT must take action within four months of proposed merger activity, but this time limit can be frozen 
in the event that European-level investigations preclude separate investigations by the OFT.
Ryanair argued that this time limit expired four months after the commission's decision in 2007.
Shares in Ryanair closed down 4.2 cents at EUR4.15, and shares in Aer Lingus rose 0.75 cents to EUR1.15.

The Orange Tree, EasyJet headquarters, Luton Airport
Food: Cheap and cheerful
Value for money: Outstanding, especially compared with what you pay on an EasyJet flight
Corporate mission: Low cost with care and convenience (or, Ryanair but nicer)
You know you are in the EasyJet canteen because a) you are at Luton airport; b) you are in a converted aircraft 
hangar, along with the rest of EasyJet's head office; and c) there is quite a lot of orange.
The budget airline's chirpy corporate colour covers the chairs, bits of the walls and several customers. The place is 
quiet on the day of my visit, where I am having a mid-morning meeting with some executives. But it heaves at 
breakfast and lunchtime, partly because the alternative is a packaged sandwich up the road in the airport terminal, 
and partly because it is sensationally cheap.
Coffee costs 90p, less than half what you pay on board EasyJet. However, you make it yourself at a machine and if 
I had to choose, I would go for the in-flight option. Not so the food at The Orange Tree, which got its name in an 
employee vote. The menu varies by day and includes Noodle Tuesday, Omelette Wednesday and Fish and Chip 
Friday. The stir-fried noodles cost £3.75 and are cooked in front of you; omelettes are an even better deal at £2.40.
Corporate Diner: The Orange Tree, EasyJet
The chefs make an effort, too: "Katy Perry Peri" chicken appeared when tickets went on sale for the pop-themed 
Christmas party. There is a screened-off area with TV, sofas and table football, which is rather pleasant. For a no-

Restorations are never to be undertaken lightly and once you have made the decision, it is wise to be aware of the 
importance of the property's location.
"If the situation changes," says Geoff Flynn of Montecastelli Restorations in Italy, "you need to be able to liquidate 
quickly. The better the location, the easier it is to shift."
The next priority is to choose a company to manage the restoration from start to finish, with a watertight contract, 
unless you can be on site daily. For your efforts, you may be rewarded with an architectural gem, otherwise out of 
your reach, which you have salvaged from ruin.

A British Airways call to overhaul "redundant" airport security checks has sparked an outpouring of support from 
airlines, pilots and airports across Europe.
Martin Broughton, BA chairman, appears to have reflected pent-up industry frustration when he robustly criticised 
some checks on Tuesday, including those for shoes and laptops, and urged authorities to stop "kowtowing" to 
American demands for tougher checks on US-bound flights.
Geoff Williams, head of security at Gatwick, the UK's second largest airport, agreed: "It is unhelpful, confusing and 
wasteful if you go through one security process and then, if you are going to another destination, have to go through 
another. It doesn't make sense. If it's good enough for the UK, which has very high standards, it should be good 
enough for the rest of the world."
Olivier Jankovec, head of Airports Council International in Europe, which represents airports, said it was "clear that 
most of the recent developments in aviation security have been driven by the US", and it was time for a one-stop 
security system between the European Union and the US to stop "useless duplications".
BA's larger German rival, Lufthansa, and its UK competitor Virgin Atlantic both said they had been pushing for more 
efficient security processes for some time.
"We have said for many years that new technology is urgently needed to ensure that security checks in airports are 
effective but quicker and less intrusive on our passengers," said Virgin.
Broghton releases pent-up tension on air security
In Spain, Iberia, which is soon to merge with BA, said airline efforts to improve passenger experience were being 
"jeopardised by the strict security measures".
Budget airlines including Ireland's Ryanair also agreed it was time to move from what UK-based EasyJet described 
as "crude, blanket security checks which inconvenience all passengers to more intelligent processes".
One of the few voices of opposition came from the US, where Stewart Baker, former head of policy at the 
Department of Homeland Security under George W. Bush, said: "I don't know what he is talking about. I hope he 
does. I think it is incumbent on him to explain what he means. I am not aware of a double standard with respect to 
shoes or laptops or liquids."
European officials were at least in part responsible for the current inefficiencies he said. "The biggest problem that 
we have had is the almost irrational campaign waged by authorities in Brussels to keep the US from using airline 
reservation data to determine how much screening passengers should get ... even though it would probably enable 
some of the streamlining that Mr Broughton evidently supports."
However, Jim McAuslan, head of the British Airline Pilots' Association, said the current "catch-all" system was 
especially frustrating for pilots, as it made "no differentiation between a captain of 20 years and a passenger who 
has just walked into the airport from the street".
The Board of Airlines Representatives, which represents 85 airlines operating in the UK, said it was not surprised 
by the industry's response.

At the Airport Operators Association conference in London, British Airways chairman Martin Broughton had a 
cheerful dig at the (absent) Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary.
In Mr Broughton's telling, Mr O'Leary goes into a pub, asks for a pint of Guinness and is told by the barman that it 
will cost him £1.
"Just £1?" asks Mr O'Leary.
"Well, I'm a great fan of yours," says the barman.
So Mr O'Leary hands over £1 and the barman goes to pour the pint, when he stops and asks: "Would you be 
wanting a glass with that?"

Book a table, turn up, order, eat - then settle your bill: it's a tried and trusted formula at restaurants around the 
world. But in recent years, private supper clubs in London have turned the order upside down, asking diners to pay 
in advance for set meals - and now two Americans are trying to spread the idea.
Late this year or early next, Nick Kokonas and Grant Achatz - the men behind Alinea, a restaurant rated number 
seven in the world by Restaurant magazine - will open Next Restaurant in Chicago, a venture drawing on business 
models from industries as varied as aerospace and London's West End.
Like theatregoers booking seats, diners will buy tickets to meals rather than pay afterwards. And like Ryanair 
customers looking for cheap flights from Dublin to Malaga, they'll find better deals during less popular time slots - 
lower prices for the same dinner on Tuesday at 9.30pm than Friday at 7pm.
"I was a derivatives trader for 10 years," says Mr Kokonas. "Demand-based pricing seems to make a lot of sense to 
me."
Not that it's an entirely new idea: witness age-old early-bird specials. But the attention the Next Restaurant 
experiment has won in the US (with almost 10,000 people registering interest in a ticket), and the popularity of the 
private supper-club model in the UK, suggests diners are open to innovation that goes beyond cuisine.
The UK restaurant industry is embracing that - in part because it has to. During the recession, many chains relied 
on vouchers to maintain volumes, but at the expense of margins. Now, as they seek to wean customers off those 
deals, they need to find more creative ways of offering value. "Pricing is one of the hot topics in the restaurant 
industry these days," says Rafi Mohammed, author of The Art of Pricing.
Restaurant goers sign up to pre-paid dining
Groupon, a website that negotiates deals for users by leveraging group buying power, has convinced as many as 
1m Britons to pay for meals ahead of time.
The company persuades businesses to offer discounts of up to 50 per cent on the condition that a certain number 
of potential customers commit to the offer. Users pay Groupon up front and the company transfers that money to 
restaurants via an electronic "redemption tool". Les Trois Garçons in Shoreditch, the Supperclub in Notting Hill and 
Gordon Ramsay's US venues have all signed up.
This has raised eyebrows in the industry, where Groupon partnerships can be seen as a sign of weakness and a 
dubious route back to health, since you may be simply attracting low-profit dealhunters.
But Clarise Faria, who runs The Loft Project supper club in Hackney, east London, says pre-paying doesn't just 
serve as a vehicle for discounts and deals. It divorces the dining experience from the less pleasant experience of 
handing over money; it allows chefs to plan food costs, leading to less wastage; and it protects venues from 
cancellations. "We can't afford to have an empty table due to no shows," she says.
Mr Kokonas agrees: "If four people cancel at Alinea at the last minute, that's 5 per cent of our revenue for the day. 
Restaurant margins are narrow. You have two no-shows, and our day is shot."
Still, for all its advantages, some industry watchers are sceptical that the mini-trend of advance-pay will spread 
further. Robert Ancill, chief executive of the restaurant consultancy The Next Idea (no relation to Next Restaurant) 
points out that dining-out tends to be an impulse-driven activity and that customers want flexibility.
In Whitbread's restaurants division, meanwhile, pre-paying of a sort is happening by stealth - when corporate travel 
managers add breakfast or dinner to employees' Premier Inn hotel stays. That advance notice improves efficiency 
at the buying and staffing levels, according to Alan Parker, outgoing chief executive.
And if one UK group was well positioned to embrace the more radical dynamic pricing approach of Next Restaurant, 
it would be Whitbread - if only because Mr Parker's replacement, Andy Harrison, arrives after serving as chief 
executive at the master of the model, EasyJet.

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou has turned a £1 annual payment from EasyJet into a minimum of £4m a year after signing a 
branding deal to settle his two-year row with the budget airline he set up 15 years ago.
The total paid to Sir Stelios in the first decade of the 50-year agreement could be close to £100m, depending on 
how much money EasyJet makes.
In return, Sir Stelios, the airline's largest shareholder, has given up his right to become chairman and appoint two 
directors, and agreed to let the airline use the name more freely.
EasyJet hopes the agreement will end what Carolyn McCall, chief executive, called the "incredibly unhelpful" 
uncertainty of a battle that has cost it around £4m in legal fees alone over the past two years.
The move was welcomed by one of the top 10 shareholders. "Yes, he's got his pound of flesh but EasyJet now has 
access to areas of expansion they were blocked from," he said.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at RBS, agreed it was "a positive move", noting it should end the "management and 
board distraction". The deal was struck on the eve of an expected judgment in the 2008 action Sir Stelios launched, 
over the terms of the original brand agreement in which the EasyJet name went to Sir Stelios, who allowed its use 
for £1 a year.
EasyJet was restricted from making more than 25 per cent of revenue from ancillary services.
EasyJet settles dispute with Stelios
Although EasyJet had been outwardly confident it would win the case, Ms McCall told the FT on Monday there were 
areas in which it might not have prevailed. "So the disruption would have continued," she said.
Sir Stelios said the size of his fees should be seen against the fact EasyJet was one of the best known brands to 
have emerged in Europe over the last 15 years.
Turnover was £2.6bn last year but is forecast to reach nearly £4bn from 2013. Shares closed up 0.6 per cent on 
Monday.

Carolyn McCall knocked 7 per cent from EasyJet's shares with her first statement as chief executive and added 12 
per cent with her second. That's a lot of turbulence from a woman promising to bring stability to the low-cost airline.
Most airlines have had an eventful year (recession, snow, strikes and volcanic ash) but EasyJet's has been 
something else: the biggest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, took it to court; the chief executive left; and an 
operational foul-up caused crew shortages and delays. Ms McCall replaced the operations director on Wednesday 
and said the problems flagged in July would be fixed. In the meantime, revenue has risen more than expected and 
full-year pre-tax profit will be slightly above the upper end of the previously forecast range of £100m-£150m.
The business still works, then, but Ms McCall and her team have to think about the broader strategy. EasyJet is 
cheaper than flag-carriers, and more convenient than larger discount rival Ryanair because it flies to major airports 
rather than smaller ones that are often further out. More than one-quarter of EasyJet's passengers are on business 
trips. But it could soon be squeezed from both sides: British Airways is defending its short-haul territory fiercely, and 
Ryanair is thinking about becoming more "carey-sharey", as chief executive Michael O'Leary puts it. That would 
include opening routes to major airports.
Then there is Sir Stelios. The open warfare can't continue, but neither can the new management team allow him to 
call the shots. His demand that EasyJet stop expanding its fleet and pay a dividend deserves consideration, but on 
its merits rather than because it would buy a quiet life. It's a lot to handle and investors will expect tangible progress 
at the full-year results presentation in November. The seat-belt light is still on.

EasyJet's director of operations has resigned after a summer of delayed flights and cancelled services at the 
budget airline.
Cor Vrieswijk, who held the job for four years, has been replaced by Warwick Brady, the airline's procurement 
director and a former director at rival airline Ryanair.
Mr Brady's appointment is the first to be made by the new chief executive Carolyn McCall and means that six of 
EasyJet's eight-strong management board have departed since the start of last year.
"Cor Vrieswijk has resigned and EasyJet has agreed to his early departure so that he can better balance his work 
and private life in Holland," the company said.
Mr Vrieswijk could not be reached for comment.
Although EasyJet has pointed to a wave of air traffic controllers' strikes in Europe as the main factor behind this 
summer's operational problems, the airline was forced in July to concede that staff shortages and poor rostering 
had also contributed to the upheaval.
Ms McCall is currently reviewing the carrier's operations, the results of which are due to be revealed next month.
EasyJet's punctuality came under fire recently after a report by Gatwick airport, the airline's largest base, found that 
fewer than half of the airline's flights there in June departed on time.
The record was worse than British Airways, which has suffered walkouts by cabin crew staff, and Air Zimbabwe.
Operations director at EasyJet resigns
Despite this, Ms McCall warned on Wednesday that looming walkouts in Greece and France next week could cause 
further delays. She urged European governments to modernise the air traffic control system in an attempt to end 
the strikes, which cost the airline £6m in compensation in September.
The appointment came as shares in EasyJet jumped nearly 12 per cent to 433.30p after the airline said a surge in 
demand for flights to beach resorts and European cities meant full-year profits would beat a prediction of £150m 
made in May.
The ash cloud, which closed European airspace in April, will clip earnings by a less-than-feared £5m. However, this 
was offset by the £6m cost of compensating passengers whose flights had been cancelled in September. Revenue 
per seat increased about 6 per cent in the year's final quarter, EasyJet said.

Spanish unions launch general strike

Spanish trade unions launched their first general strike in eight years, in a one-day show of force to protest against 
labour reforms and government austerity measures imposed as a result of the global crisis.
Only about 17 per cent of Spanish employees belong to trade unions, one of the lowest levels in Europe, but the 
unions are strongly represented in the crucial transport sector.
The strike on Wednesday affected most forms of public transport in Spain's big cities - including flights and trains - 
with shouting strikers picketing bus stations in the capital Madrid to prevent them from running. Ryanair, the low-
cost airline, cancelled Spanish domestic flights and most of its international flights to and from the country.
As demonstrators waving red trade union flags emerged from the Madrid headquarters of the Unión General de 
Trabajadores (UGT), one of the two main unions, early in the morning, the government said there were no unusual 
incidents and that the strike had begun calmly.
"The day is proceeding normally," said Celestino Corbacho, labour minister. The government said minimum 
essential services agreed for trains and other forms of transport were being 99 per cent fulfilled. Electricity 
consumption, however, was below normal and industrial power use was 21 per cent down from the normal level.
Spanish unions are protesting against everything from labour market liberalisation to a proposed increase in the 
retirement age and a 5 per cent cut in civil service wages. Cándido Méndez, UGT leader, has complained of "a 
flood of unjustified and unjust measures".
Spanish unions launch general strike
Ignacio Fernández Toxo, secretary-general of the Comisiones Obreras, the biggest union, said in a radio interview 
this week that José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the socialist prime minister, was "committing suicide" by turning to the 
right and opening the way to power for the right-wing opposition.
"He's doing things in such a way that people will come to the conclusion that they might as well have the real thing," 
he said.
However, with unemployment at 20 per cent of the workforce, ordinary Spaniards seem to have little appetite for 
militant protests. A recent opinion poll showed that only 9 per cent of those questioned in early September definitely 
planned to take part in the strike, down from 15 per cent in July.
The government, meanwhile, is content to have the strike show the outside world that Spain is serious about 
budgetary austerity, according to Spanish political commentators.
Trade unions have targeted Madrid partly because it is run by the conservative Popular party and partly because 
their actions receive fuller media coverage in the capital. Roads were busy early in the morning as commuters took 
their cars to reach work, but initial signs were that life was close to normal.

Only about 17 per cent of Spanish employees belong to trade unions, one of the lowest levels in Europe, but the

Wednesday's strike coincided with a demonstration in Brussels in which with thousands of workers plan to protest 
against public spending cuts in a show of solidarity by the European Trade Union Confederation.  Trade unions are 
co-ordinating protests in a dozen other European countries including Portugal, Ireland and France.
The Spanish strike affected most forms of public transport in Spain's big cities - including flights and trains - with 
shouting strikers picketing bus stations in the capital Madrid to prevent them from running. Ryanair, the low-cost

this week that José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the socialist prime minister, was "committing suicide" by turning to the 
right and opening the way to power for the right-wing opposition.
"He's doing things in such a way that people will come to the conclusion that they might as well have the real thing," 
he said.
However, with unemployment at 20 per cent of the workforce, ordinary Spaniards seem to have little appetite for 
militant protests. A recent opinion poll showed that only 9 per cent of those questioned in early September definitely 
planned to take part in the strike, down from 15 per cent in July.
The government, meanwhile, is content to have the strike show the outside world that Spain is serious about 
budgetary austerity, according to Spanish political commentators.
Unions have targeted Madrid partly because it is run by the conservative Popular party and partly because their 
actions receive fuller media coverage in the capital. Roads were busy early in the morning as commuters took their 
cars to reach work, but initial signs were that life was close to normal.
European unions are trying to capitalise on widespread anger at the financial sector, painting workers as the victims 
of the economic downturn caused by reckless bankers.
John Monks, head of the European Trade Union Confederation, has argued that the bill for the recession needs to 
be paid for by the banks, not by workers.
BusinessEurope, the main employers' group in Brussels, said spending cuts were necessary to ensure the long-
term economic health of the European economy.
"By delaying the necessary reforms, we will only make things worse," said Philippe de Buck, its director-general.

AirTran deal casts light on no-frills model

Southwest Airlines' move to buy its smaller budget rival, AirTran, is not just a big deal in the US.
It is also one of the world's biggest tie-ups in a no-frills airline business that effectively started with Southwest's birth 
nearly 40 years ago, prompting speculation about what it might mean for the low-cost industry globally.
Budget carriers around the world have copied the model pioneered by Southwest, which carried more than 101m 
passengers last year, more than any other airline in the world.
However, its relentless growth has begun to show signs of slowing in recent years and, as many analysts have 
noted, growth is not just a symptom of success in low-cost airlines, but a critical driver of it.
Getting bigger each year lowered Southwest's labour costs, as new staff tend to cost less than older ones. It also 
generated better returns because its aircraft were heavily used, says Bill Swelbar, a research engineer at 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's International Center for Air Transportation.
As growth has slowed, costs have risen: Southwest's pilots and flight attendants are now among the best paid in 
the industry, making a return to expansion vital to maintain its profitability.
That makes acquisitions one logical choice, says Mr Swelbar.
"Southwest was a company built on a growth platform and it has had to look for new strategies for its business," he 
said.
The prospects of consolidation are seen as less likely in regions such as the Middle East and Asia, where budget 
airlines are a thriving but relatively recent addition.
AirTran deal casts light on no-frills model
But in Europe, an enthusiastic follower of the budget airline model after the US, the Southwest-AirTran deal raises 
big questions about Ryanair.
The Irish airline was an early follower of Southwest. Its outspoken chief, Michael O'Leary, has described a 
reconnaissance trip to meet Southwest's colourful founder, Herb Kelleher, as a "road to Damascus".
EasyJet's Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou and Virgin's Sir Richard Branson have also acknowledged their debts to Mr 
Kelleher.
But few followed as successfully as Ryanair, the fifth-biggest airline in the world by passenger numbers last year, 
after Southwest, American Airlines, Delta and China Southern Airlines.
So could a big acquisition be a prospect for Ryanair?
Mr O'Leary dismissed the idea in an interview with the FT this month. "There's nothing out there for sale, it's all 
rubbish. Everything for sale is losing money; would destroy our earnings," he said.
Should he ever change his mind, Ryanair is hardly lacking in financial ammunition.
With annualised cash flows of more than EUR500m ($679m), "it certainly has ample resources", says Joe Gill, 
director of equity research at Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin.
One obvious target for an acquisition would be its closest rival, UK-based EasyJet.
But as Mr Gill points out, EasyJet would be much bigger for Ryanair to digest than AirTran would be for Southwest.
In addition, EasyJet has Airbus jets and Ryanair, like Southwest, has Boeings, and one of the lessons Mr Kelleher 
taught his followers is the desirability of a uniform fleet, with its lower crew training and maintenance costs.
AirTran also has Boeing aircraft, and while not all are the same model as Southwest's fleet of 544 Boeing 737 jets, 
analysts say they represent good value.
For all these reasons, Mr Gill is doubtful about Ryanair making such a move.
"It seems very unlikely that they are interested in buying another airline," he said. "They appear to be more focused 
on getting cheap aircraft."

THE PROBLEM
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary recently said he would lobby aviation authorities for permission to use only one pilot a 
flight. In response, one of the company's pilots proposed in a letter to the Financial Times that Ryanair replace its 
CEO with a 'probationary cabin crew member' to save money. The company took the public needling in its stride, 
but should it have responded more forcefully?
THE ADVICE
The academic: Maury Peiperl
A culture of openness is essential in any company that has to learn fast and change with the times, but it has its 
costs. Washing some dirty linen in public is one of them.
Coming down hard on dissenters is one of the easiest ways to kill an open culture, so all credit to Ryanair for not 
taking that route. Because the pilot's jibe was nothing if not funny, the company and the public now get to 
appreciate it in a light-hearted atmosphere. The underlying regulatory issue, however, will get settled the way such 
issues usually do - through informed dialogue, lobbying and negotiation. I don't think the pilot's comment will affect 
the outcome one way or the other.

The conflict manager: Jackie Keddy
Should companies rebuke employees for public criticism?
Organisations may be within their rights to stamp down hard on employees who choose to air company issues in 
public. But whatever is said behind closed doors as a result of such airing shouldn't necessarily be made public.
This seems like an example of a disgruntled pilot who could have chosen to bail out of his job, but felt sufficiently at 
ease to speak his mind without risking the chop. Ryanair's decision to not rise to the bait on this actually might work 
in its favour - showing an employer whose employees are able to let off steam about the boss or express 
themselves with such strong passion, rather than one that rules through fear and recrimination. At least, that's the 
way things might be seen from the outside . . .

..................................................
The consultant: Jonathon Hogg
E-mail, text, Twitter and the internet make it tempting, and easy, to express an opinion, pass judgment and critique 
your employer in public. Everyone will have felt the urge to have their say when the boss has done something silly. 
Leaders need to recognise it is impossible - and undesirable - to keep a lid on employee opinion.
To avoid painful and embarrassing public challenges such as this, companies need to create trust and transparency 
inside their businesses. Leaders should share their thoughts with staff, solicit intelligent questions, encourage 
debate and dialogue and, hardest of all, learn to tolerate dissent. That will go some way towards reducing the 
temptation of using the letters page to tell the boss what you think.

Two back-handed tributes to the influence of Vladimir Raitz have made the news this month. One was the idea - 
perhaps merely a stunt - from Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, that his budget airline's planes be 
allowed to fly with one pilot (this followed hard on the heels of earlier wheezes to sell tickets for standing room, and 
to charge for using the lavatory). The other was the unveiling, by Italian company Aviointeriors, of a "saddle seat" in 
which passengers would half-sit, half-stand.
These are tributes because Raitz, who has died at the age of 88, was a pioneer of mass travel. He has a strong 
claim to be the inventor of the UK package holiday, a concept that, from its inception in 1949, has brought pleasure 
to many, and sneers to the faces of a few. He had a large hand in creating what became, in the first postwar 
decades of steadily rising lower-class incomes, a burgeoning market in leisure, a commodity that working people 
had barely known before the war.
Mass consumption and leisure was decried by a left concerned that consumption would blunt class consciousness 
and by a right that saw in it vulgarity and an end to deference. But it became a social and political force that, by the 
mid-1960s, no serious politician could decry and few serious businesses ignore. Mass travel and leisure created 
Ryanair, and provided Italian designers with a space downmarket of Versace and Ferrari. Raitz laid a part of these 
foundations.
As he recounts in his memoir, Flight to the Sun, Raitz fell into the trade during an August 1949 visit to the town of 
Calvi - a former Genoese citadel - on the French island of Corsica. He was an exotic survivor: his White Russian 
family (minus the father, who disappeared) fled from the Bolsheviks in 1928, to Berlin then Vienna. Jews, they fled 
again from the Nazis, to London in 1936. Raitz quickly added English to his list of languages, attended the London 
School of Economics and joined Reuters: the Corsican jaunt was his first holiday.
Pioneer of sun, sand and disinhibition on a budget
A club had been created near Calvi's perfect beach, founded by fellow White Russians. Clients, mainly French and 
Belgian, slept in army surplus tents on the beach, drank all the wine they could and danced in the clubhouse. (The 
club's Belgian agent, Gérard Blitz, a former French résistant, later founded Club Med.) One of the club's owners, 
Baron Nicholas Steinhell, proposed to Raitz that he be the British agent. Quickly grasping the potential, Raitz 
returned to the UK, left Reuters, put a (then substantial) £3,000 inheritance into founding Horizon Holidays and 
chartered some planes.
The venture had been made possible by the US Air Force. The planes were surplus US Dakotas; the tents surplus 
USAF accommodation; the airport, a strip built by USAF Seabees. The first flight's passengers had to wait for the 
bus, sheltering from the unfamiliar sun, under the wing - there being no building nearby. Once they got to their tents 
- each with two camp beds - they discovered a paradise: constant heat, free wine and (a particular item in the 
advertising for ration-card Britain) two meat meals a day. The cost was £32.10 for two weeks: a substantial amount 
(£800 in today's money) but within reach of the non-rich.
The young tyro had to overcome currency restrictions, a British European Airways attempt to ban his flights and an 
order to expunge his "brash" advertising - "Come to Corsica" in large letters painted on Horizon's first office 
building, 146 Fleet Street. After that, it was all expansion - to Majorca, Sardinia and Malaga. Horizon prospered, its 
clientele spreading down the social scale, until 1974, when it was taken over by Clarkson's - in time for the three-
day week and oil embargo, which pushed the company into bankruptcy and its customers into hopeless queues 
waiting for relief flights home.
Raitz, however, carried on in the trade he had grown to love - organising tours for the Maltese Travel Board, 
managing Medallion Holidays and then the Hickie Borman Group - which went into receivership in 1991. He was 
77, in 1999, when Colin Trigger, chairman of Scantours, persuaded him to join in a package holiday venture to 
Cuba - flying back to a communist state, some 71 years after his family had fled Soviet Russia. He launched "cigar 
tours" - he had been an aficionado of Havanas since his late 20s - with some success.
His status as the "inventor" of the package holiday can be challenged: Roger Bray mentions Agostino Contarini, a 
14th-century entrepreneurial Venetian, who organised pilgrimage trips to the Holy land for 60 ducats a day. 
Tourism's infrastructure was laid by the Victorians: Thomas Cook took tourists to European cities from 1855, and Dr 
(later Sir) Henry Lunn organised winter sportstrips to Chamonix from 1898. In the UK, Billy Butlin opened his first 
camp in 1934, at Skegness; his second, at Clacton, opened in 1938, when parliament passed a law mandating one 
week of paid holiday to industrial workers - putting the first, fragile floor under mass British leisure demand.
But Raitz - imaginative, curious, a youthful survivor of murderous regimes, happy to be alive in a west at peace - 
brought together the elements of sun, sand and disinhibition. If he later expressed regret at the concrete-isation of 
the "charming little spots" in which he pitched his first tents, he did not express remorse for his central achievement: 
the facilitation of northern European joyous abandon beneath a southern sun.
Vladimir Gavrilovich Raitz, born May 23 1922, died on August 31, leaving his wife, born Toni Corkrey, three 
daughters and five grandchildren.

BA chief warns Europe of threat from Mideast airlines

Europe has failed to recognise the "significant threat" of ambitious Middle Eastern airlines, the head of British 
Airways has warned.
Willie Walsh told industry leaders: "We have been very slow in the UK and in Europe to recognise the new 
competitive threat.
"We should as Europe be concerned about what's happening here."
In a sign of European airlines' apprehension about the rapid growth of airlines such as Dubai's Emirates, Etihad of 
Abu Dhabi and Qatar Airways, Mr Walsh told the European Aviation Club in Brussels that these carriers were being 
backed by exceedingly determined governments.
Mr Walsh, who is also the current chair of the Association of European Airlines, said it was especially worrying to 
see Europe "funding the expansion of Emirates", which is growing so rapidly some say it could change longhaul 
aviation in the way Ryanair and other no-frills carriers have transformed shorthaul flying.
He was referring to a long-standing informal agreement between Europe and the US that prohibits countries where 
Boeing and Airbus aircraft are built from providing export credit agency guarantees to local airlines to help them buy 
aircraft.
This so-called home country rule means BA, Lufthansa of Germany and Air France cannot access the same sort of 
European export credit financing available to Emirates or other Middle East airlines, or indeed Ireland's Ryanair.
BA chief warns Europe of threat from Mideast airlines
He said: "These are our competitors. We're financing our competitors by providing them with cheap access to 
capital. There's something not right there. I do not take this threat lightly. I think this is a very significant threat."
Tim Clark, Emirates president, said Middle East airlines did not create the export credit rules Mr Walsh was 
complaining about and used them only for a minority of their aircraft.
Mr Clark said European governments were well aware of the importance of Emirates, the biggest customer for 
Airbus's A380 superjumbo, to the region's aerospace industry.
"The last thing they want to upset is Emirates because we're the only ones buying aeroplanes," he said.
Separately, Mr Walsh he told a room liberally scattered with European Commission officials that BA and other 
northern European airlines were worried about the "financial injustice" they faced as a result of aviation's looming 
entry into the European Union's emissions trading scheme in 2012.
The base year for benchmarking airlines' carbon emissions is 2010, but Mr Walsh said would unfairly penalise 
airlines such as BA and others in northern parts of Europe who were effectively shut down for a week during the 
April volcanic ash crisis.
He added that airlines in southern countries such as Spain, which suffered less during the period, would have an 
unfair advantage.

From Captain Morgan Fischer.
Sir, I would like to share with you a cost-saving suggestion I have proposed to the Ryanair board ("Ryanair's talk of 
spree on aircraft casts cloud over dividend hopes", September 8). I write in my capacity as a B737-800 line training 
captain assigned to Ryanair's Marseilles, France base. My primary job responsibility involves the line training and 
checking of co-pilots and captains on both an initial and a recurrent basis.
As a Ryanair employee, I am aware of the company's desire to reduce costs whenever feasible, and, in so doing, 
pass on these lower costs in the form of lower fares to the travelling public.
I would propose that Ryanair replace the chief executive with a probationary cabin crew member currently earning 
about EUR13,200 net a year. Ryanair would benefit by saving millions of euros in salary, benefits and stock 
options. Further, there will be no need to petition either Boeing or governmental aviation regulators for approval to 
replace the CEO with a cabin crew member; as such approval would not be required.
Finally, the position of CEO could, in fact, become a source of ancillary revenue for Ryanair. Currently, Ryanair's 
contract cabin crew providers charge new recruits for the cost of their training - EUR3,000 in fact. Ryanair could 
similarly charge EUR3,000 for the training required to become chief executive.

From Captain Evan Cullen.
Sir, I refer to "Ryanair's talk of spree on aircraft casts cloud over dividend hopes" (September 8) where Michael 
O'Leary is quoted as saying that the risk of pilot incapacitation does not merit the presence or cost of a qualified co-
pilot.
Mr O'Leary is notably skilful at obtaining publicity by means of outrageous statements that the media find 
newsworthy. However, his misrepresentations in this case demand clarification. His claims that there was only one 
such incident in 25 years and that the pilot "landed the plane" are incorrect.
In fact, there have been at least two significant events in Ryanair involving crew member incapacitation. In the 
reported event, the physicians who eventually reached the cockpit determined the captain to be clinically dead. 
(While he was revived following strenuous efforts he subsequently died.) The captain did not land the aircraft, as 
was claimed by Mr O'Leary. However, the safety outcome was well within tolerances expected in such rare events. 
This testifies to the key role played by the co-pilot. In the second incident, the incapacity of a captain gave rise to 
potentially grave consequences that exceeded acceptable safety tolerances. The safety implications are obvious, 
as is the reason for having two qualified pilots in the cockpit.
In respect of Mr O'Leary's comments, members of the deceased captain's family wish that these matters be 
clarified. I therefore write to you on their behalf as well as that of my organisation. The family note that the official 
accident report contains references to failures of training in pilot incapacitation provided to the cabin crew, as well 
as the elapsed time prior to providing the captain with oxygen and medical assistance. In fact, this most unfortunate 
event evokes for them unpleasant memories that go beyond the immediate operational consequences of pilot 
incapacitation. Their appreciation of all the events and circumstances surrounding the incapacitation event is very 
different from that represented by Mr O'Leary.
Ryanair plan to axe co-pilots raises safety issue
Mr O'Leary has been on the board of Ryanair since 1988 and chief executive since 1994. That he is prepared to 
make such statements while, apparently, not being fully briefed on these important safety matters is entirely 
consistent with Ryanair's "innovative" approach to staff relations, safety, pilot fatigue and related matters.

was claimed by Mr O'Leary. However, the safety outcome was well within tolerances expected in such rare events. 
This testifies to the key role played by the co-pilot. In the second incident, the incapacity of a captain gave rise to 
potentially grave consequences that exceeded acceptable safety tolerances. The safety implications are obvious, 
as is the reason for having two qualified pilots in the cockpit.
In respect of Mr O'Leary's comments, members of the deceased captain's family wish that these matters be 
clarified. I therefore write to you on their behalf as well as that of my organisation. The family note that the official 
accident report contains references to failures of training in pilot incapacitation provided to the cabin crew, as well 
as the elapsed time prior to providing the captain with oxygen and medical assistance. In fact, this most unfortunate 
event evokes for them unpleasant memories that go beyond the immediate operational consequences of pilot 
incapacitation. Their appreciation of all the events and circumstances surrounding the incapacitation event is very 
different from that represented by Mr O'Leary.
Ryanair plan to axe co-pilots raises safety issue
Mr O'Leary has been on the board of Ryanair since 1988 and chief executive since 1994. That he is prepared to 
make such statements while, apparently, not being fully briefed on these important safety matters is entirely 
consistent with Ryanair's "innovative" approach to staff relations, safety, pilot fatigue and related matters.

Ryanair 's latest no-frills idea: sack the boss

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has for years endured complaints from passengers about his famously no-frills Irish 
airline.
Now a senior Ryanair pilot has taken the rare step of publicly challenging his boss after the outspoken chief 
executive said he was trying to convince authorities to let his aircraft fly with only one pilot. A flight attendant could 
do the job of a co-pilot if needed, Mr O'Leary said last week, because "the computer does most of the flying now".
Captain Morgan Fischer, who trains other pilots at Ryanair's Marseilles base, says he knows the airline is dedicated 
to keeping its costs as low as possible, so why not go one better - and replace Mr O'Leary with a junior flight 
attendant?
"I would propose that Ryanair replace the CEO with a probationary cabin crew member currently earning 
approximately EUR13,200 net per annum," Capt Fischer has written in a letter to the Financial Times, which 
reported Mr O'Leary's comments last week.
"Ryanair would benefit by saving millions of euros in salary, benefits and stock options," the captain said, and there 
would be no need for approval from the authorities.
Mr O'Leary quibbled with some of Capt Fischer's numbers but, in characteristically mischievous mode, he effected 
to agree with some of his points.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
Ryanair 's latest no-frills idea: sack the boss
"Michael thinks that cabin crew would make a far more attractive CEO than him - this obviously isn't a very high bar 
- so we are going to seriously look at the suggestion," said Stephen McNamara, a Ryan­air spokesman. "After all, if 
we can train cabin crew to land the plane, it should be no problem training them to do Michael's job as well."
Capt Fischer, 41, who has been based in Marseilles for the past five years and has 20 years' flying experience, 
mostly with TWA and American Airlines, declined to comment further on Monday.
Mr O'Leary is well known for his ability to generate headlines with eye-catching ideas, from coin-operated lavatories 
to "fat taxes". But his thoughts on ditching co-pilots - first raised in a Bloomberg Businessweek interview earlier this 
month - seem to have struck a sensitive nerve among some.
Ryanair employees have complained to the media in the past, but most have done so anonymously.
Seeing a pilot publicly poke fun at Mr O'Leary, as Capt Fischer has done, is "extremely unique", said Capt Evan 
Cullen, president of the Irish Airline Pilots' Association, who has also written to the FT about Mr O'Leary's 
comments.
Capt Cullen was provoked by Mr O'Leary's suggestion that, in 25 years, Ryanair had had only one pilot who had 
suffered a heart attack in flight, "and he landed the plane".
Capt Cullen said Mr O'Leary must have been referring to a 2002 incident in Belgium when a pilot collapsed with a 
heart attack shortly after take-off from Charleroi airport south of Brussels. A doctor on board who assisted the pilot 
described him as "clinically dead", according to a report by Ireland's Air Accident Investigation Unit, and the co-pilot 
had to return the aircraft to the airport.
"The safety implications are obvious, as is the reason for having two qualified pilots in the cockpit," said Capt 
Cullen.
Mr McNamara said this was not the incident Mr O'Leary had been referring to, "although the fact that the first officer 
landed the aircraft without incident underlines the fact that a first officer in the cabin, or a suitably-trained cabin 
crew, could readily land an aircraft in such an emergency".
He said the issue at stake was that aircraft were now heavily automated, and with more than 500,000 flights a year 
the second pilot was rarely, if ever, called on to land in an emergency.
Some safety experts dis­agree. "It is true that aircraft are far safer today than ever before and many of the 
processes have been automated," said Paul Hayes, air safety director at Ascend aviation consultan­cy. "But in a 
high work-load situation, say an instrument approach in congested air space or in an emergency, I'd still like to have 
a pilot and co-pilot working together as a team."

Ryanair's success is extraordinary, not just for an airline but for any business, writes Pilita Clark. It has grown from 
a tiny outfit in 1985 flying 5,000 passengers a year between Ireland and London in a single aircraft, to an operation 
with more than 200 aircraft flying about 70m passengers a year to roughly 160 destinations.
When Michael O'Leary took over in 1994, he aggressively expanded the airline into a highly profitable operation. 
Only four airlines in the world carry more passengers. British Airways ranks 18th.
BA has, however, lost almost £1bn over the past two years in a downturn that has seen airlines round the world slip 
into the red. Ryanair did lose EUR180.5m the year before last, but made a pre-tax profit of EUR341m in the 12 
months to the end of March this year, making it one of the most profitable carriers in Europe.

ANA to launch budget airline
ANA to launch budget airline

All Nippon Airways and Hong Kong-based First Eastern Investment Group have launched a bid to reshape Japan's 
costly air travel market with the creation of a new low-cost carrier which could cut fares on some routes in half.
Japan's air travel market has long been tightly protected, but recent deregulation and expanded airport capacity in 
major cities is opening it up to greater competition. Landing fees and fuel taxes, now the highest among major 
countries, are expected to fall under proposed government reforms.
ANA and First Eastern announced the new venture on Thursday and said flights would begin in the second half of 
next year. It is the first foray into aviation for First Eastern, a property and industrial investor with holdings across 
Asia, which will take 33 per cent of the new company.
"We are partnering with the number one airline in Japan at the right time," said Victor Chu, First Eastern chairman. 
"People are increasingly looking for value spending."
One catalyst for the new venture is the bankruptcy in January of Japan Airlines, Japan's former national carrier and 
its largest by revenues. JAL is dropping dozens of domestic and international routes as part of a three-year, 
government-backed restructuring.
"The challenges at JAL give new opportunities for a new player," Mr Chu said.
ANA, Japan's second-largest airline, will own 39 per cent of the low-cost carrier, which will be capitalised with 
Y15bn ($179m) initially and based at Kansai International Airport, an underused hub near the western city of 
Osaka. A consortium of smaller Japanese investors will own the remainder of the carrier.
ANA to launch budget airline
The airline is to operate on domestic routes for the first year or two before expanding to cover other destinations in 
Asia. A new partner, possibly a Chinese airline, could be brought on board for the second phase. "We are keeping 
our options open," Mr Chu said.
He said he hoped to have five to 10 aircraft flying within the first year and to charge half what Japan's incumbent 
carriers, including ANA, do on the same routes. A round-trip flight from Tokyo to Osaka on ANA currently costs 
Y40,000 ($500) before early-booking discounts.
The new airline is one of several budget carriers trying to crack the Japanese market. Jetstar, owned by Australia's 
Qantas Airways, flies between several Japanese and Australian cities, and Malaysia-based AirAsia is also 
considering adding Japanese routes.
Several cheaper domestic start-ups also exist in Japan, such as Skymark and Air Do. But like all carriers operating 
in the country, high fixed costs mean they have been unable to achieve the sort of radically lower fares offered by 
the likes of Dublin-based Ryanair or JetBlue of the US.
"Japan does not have a true low-cost carrier," according to Geoffrey Tudor, an analyst at Japan Aviation 
Management Research.
Masaru Onishi, president of JAL, said last month he was also examining setting up a low-cost carrier. JAL says 
airport landing fees and fuel taxes cost it Y172bn in fiscal 2008, equivalent to about 10 per cent of sales.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary might be one of the world's great technophobes who famously claims not to use e-
mail, but he has fallen in love with his new iPad.
Unlike his iPhone, which he thinks is "a hopeless phone" that the loquacious chief kept losing until he swapped it for 
a museum-era Nokia mobile, Mr O'Leary said the iPad was "great" not least for checking on company figures. All 
the better to help him come up with ways of squeezing more out of his customers.

Ryanair talk of aircraft spree damps dividend hopes

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary could be back in the market to buy up to 300 aircraft in a multibillion-dollar spend that 
could scupper investors' hopes of future dividends from the European budget airline.
He also revealed he is writing to aviation authorities for permission to use only one pilot per flight because he says 
co-pilots are unnecessary in modern jets where "the computer does most of the flying now".
Mr O'Leary said in an interview: "It would save the entire industry a fortune", adding that trains were allowed to have 
one driver even though this could conceivably cause a crash in the event of a heart attack.
He said: "In 25 years with over about 10m flights, we've had one pilot who suffered a heart attack in flight and he 
landed the plane".
He conceded that two pilots would be needed on long haul international flights but on Ryanair's shorter trips, flight 
attendants could do the job of a co-pilot, who was only there to "make sure the first fella doesn't fall asleep and 
knock over one of the computer controls".
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
His comments come as the Dublin-based airline prepares to pay a EUR500m (£414m) dividend next month - its first 
- after Mr O'Leary pulled out of a deal to buy 200 Boeing jets late last year.
He has held out the prospect of paying a second dividend in 2013, unless Ryanair found a better use for its growing 
pile of cash which, he said, might not happen.
Ryanair talk of aircraft spree damps dividend hopes
This prompted some analysts to suggest he was finally reining back the airline's aggressive growth strategy that 
has seen it grow into a airline carrying twice as many passengers as older rivals such as British Airways..
He said: "All other things being equal, if we're still generating this amount of cash and we haven't found any 
acquisition or aircraft acquisition for it, then we would certainly consider a second dividend by about the end of 
2013.
"But if I was a shareholder I wouldn't be banking on that yet."
He said he saw no airline on the market worth buying, but there was still the option of purchasing not just the 200 
Boeing jets, worth about $15bn (£9.8bn) at advertised prices, but up to 300 from either Boeing or its rival, Airbus.
Ryanair had told both manufacturers in early summer that it could buy "200 to 300" aircraft if suitable prices and 
terms were offered, he said, though there were no negotiations at present.

You can't fault Willie Walsh for ambition. The British Airways boss has not yet completed the merger with Iberia. 
Some believe his company's business model is irreparably flawed. He remains at war with BA trade unions. And he 
has a pension deficit of £2.7bn. Yet he has already donned his new hat as soon-to-be chief of International Airlines 
Group, as the merged BA/Iberia will be known, and speculated aloud that his new company will emerge as a - 
perhaps the - leader in airline consolidation. He says he has identified up to a dozen future acquisition or merger 
candidates.
Mr Walsh's comments are premature, since IAG won't exist for another few months. They may sound like hubris, 
but the principle is right. The dysfunctional airline industry cries out for consolidation. This is happening at the 
regional level: Air France/KLM, Continental/United, a proposed fusion of LAN of Chile and Brazil's TAM - and IAG. 
Investors are happy; BA shares are up 20 per cent this year and Iberia's have jumped 36 per cent.
The real prize for any would-be world airline leader, however, is consolidation in the long-haul market, with its high 
share of premium-priced seats. Mr Walsh knows the problems, having failed to merge BA with the Australian 
Qantas. Outside of Europe, many governments still resist foreign ownership. Acquisitions may be easier for IAG in 
the Old Continent, but the market there is mature and has been hollowed out by the low-cost model of Ryanair and 
EasyJet. For airlines, the real growth is in Asia and Latin America. IAG may yet be able to consolidate its way into 
getting a bigger share in those markets. But Mr Walsh must get his new airline up to cruising altitude before 
attempting to make his grandiose dreams come true.

Aer Lingus narrowed its losses in the first half with the former Irish state owned carrier benefiting from lower 
operating costs, savings in its fuel bill and cost reductions resulting from an ambitious staff reorganisation 
programme.
Losses for the six months to June 30 were EUR20.8m. This is a 74 per cent improvement on the same period last 
year when the company recorded losses of EUR81.7m.
Revenues fell 3.1 per cent to EUR557m from EUR648m, largely as the company slashed its North American route 
network, resulting in fewer passengers.
Operating costs fell 14 per cent, while the fuel bill was down 30 per cent. Staff costs were cut by 10 per cent, with 
staff numbers down by 7 per cent. With a 25 per cent reduction in its long haul capacity, Aer Lingus carried 11 per 
cent fewer passengers overall. But with unit costs reduced, the yield per passenger - a measure of an airline's 
profitability - was up 8 per cent.
Christoph Mueller, chief executive, described the improvement in its long-haul operation as "an incredible upswing".
The company had a gross cash position at the half year of more than EUR1bn, reflecting increased working capital 
as passengers make advance bookings. Mr Mueller expects the year-end cash position to be at least EUR850m.
"This gives us a breathing space that most other airlines don't have," he said.
The airline, which was privatised in 2006, says it is "on track" to achieve the EUR97m savings earmarked under its 
Greenfield cost-reduction programme, which represents a 7 per cent reduction in its cost base.
Aer Lingus narrows losses
The company, which is 29 per cent owned by Ryanair the rival low cost carrier, expects to do "no worse than break-
even" in the current year but declined to provide guidance for 2011 due to market uncertainties.
- FT Comment
Rationalisation of its long-haul offering was long overdue. Better hedging should keep fuel costs lower. But 
profitability will depend on the company being able to press on with its cost reduction programme.
Without a lower cost base, the airline is not in a position to be able to offer prices that can compete with its peers. 
Even with the full impact of its Greenfield restructuring programme, Aer Lingus costs will still be slightly higher than 
those of Easyjet, and considerably higher than Ryanair, against whom it also competes.
The long-term survival of the airline, in which the Irish government retains a 25 per cent strategic stake, could still 
depend on factors outside the company's control. But Mr Mueller has made a good start at putting the airline back 
on track to profitability. If it achieves breakeven this year it will be the first time since 2007. Aer Lingus shares were 
down 1 cent at 92 cents in morning trading.

ultimately profitability will depend on the company being able to press on with its cost-reduction programme. 
Without a lower cost base, the airline is not in a position to be able to offer prices that can compete with its peers.

Mueller has made a good start at putting the airline back on track towards profitability. If Aer Lingus achieves break-
even this year it will be the first time since 2007, but none of this recovery story is reflected in the company's 
shares. On an enterprise value/ebitda basis, the airline is trading at 3 times 2011 earnings, compared with 5 times 
for most flag carriers and more than 7 times for the low-cost operators. Another measure that the stock looks 
underpriced is the market capitalisation of EUR480m, which compares with net cash at the period end of 
EUR401m.

We've had pop-up shops, restaurants and hotels, but next month the Swiss are going one better - with the world's 
first pop-up golf course. Lasting just a month, from September 10, the 18-hole course will be located in the 
mountains above the village of Adelboden. At an altitude of more than 2,000 metres, it will be Europe's highest 
course, with plenty to challenge even the best golfers: streams, rocks, rapidly changing weather conditions and 
considerable height differences between tee and green. There will also be a driving range and a clubhouse in a 
cosy mountain cabin. www.golfmountain.ch

Florida-based Spirit Airlines seems intent on trumping Ireland's Ryanair in the race to introduce as many ancillary 
charges as possible. Last weekend it began charging passengers for carry-on, as well as checked luggage, in what 
is believed to be an aviation first. Passengers can still take a purse or small bag onboard for free, but a standard-
sized carry-on bag now costs between $20 and $45 per flight. The airline says the charge will help planes leave on 
time, and is part of its "Ultra Low Cost Carrier" approach. www.spiritair.com

State-owned Thai Airways International's move to set up a budget airline with Tiger Airways is likely to give 
momentum to moves towards a more open regional airline architecture, but it will also fuel concerns about 
overcapacity.
The Sydney-based Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation said: "Until now, the Thai government has been highly protective 
of its flag carrier and has been threatening to drag the chain on the Asean multilateral timetable for moving towards 
open skies for south-east Asian airlines.
"This position could now soften, as high-cost Thai Airways will have the opportunity to meet competition on a more 
equal footing."
The two carriers said the marriage was prompted by expanding opportunities in intra-regional tourism, a market that 
south-east Asia and Thailand in particular has failed to exploit.
Tony Davis, Tiger's chief executive, said: "Bangkok is a key gateway to the whole of south-east Asia and from its 
base at Suvarnabhumi Airport, Thai Tiger will be well positioned to also serve destinations in northern Asia and the 
Indian sub-continent".
It is a market that Thai has been unable to tap on its own.
Over the past seven years, tourist arrivals from eastern Asian countries into Thailand, the region's most popular 
leisure destination, have fallen from just over 60 per cent of all arrivals to just over 50 per cent. In absolute terms 
the number of Chinese arrivals in Thailand has shrunk in recent years.
Alliance opens doors for cross-border business
Many of the increasing number of Chinese tourists appear to be heading to Hong Kong and Taiwan. A viable low-
cost option could help reverse the trend.
There is no  shortage of no-frills airlines inAsia and the Pacific. Tiger, which raised S$277m (US$205m) in an IPO 
this year and counts the Ryan family - of Ryanair fame - and Singapore Airlines among its shareholders, is the 
smallest of the flock.
Malaysia's Air-Asia, - among the first of the low-cost carriers to recognise the value of cross-border joint ventures - 
has a fleet of 82 aircraft; Jetstar owned by Australia's Qantas Airways, along with its joint ventures Singapore-based 
Jetstar Asia and Vietnam-based Jetstar Pacific, has 68, and Tiger just 19.
But all three have ambitious expansion programmes. According to Capa, AirAsia has at least 165 planes on order, 
Jetstar 66 and Tiger 52. And that has led some people to worry about overcapacity.
Chris Tarry, a veteran airline industry observer, said: "In essence Asia is a growing market because of the high rate 
of GDP growth, but you have some of the established carriers responding to the challenge".
Mr Tarry said the law of diminishing returns was likely to cut in as the supply of profitable new routes started to 
diminish and both low-cost and legacy airlines were forced to compete on established routes.
He said: "The low-cost airlines are growth airlines and as growth slows, they are likely to fall from favour".

Strikes and ash take their toll on BA

British Airways suffered another quarter of losses as it was hit by cabin crew strikes and the volcanic ash cloud that 
closed large parts of European airspace for six days in April.
But the flag carrier showed strong growth in profit margins as more business-class seats were filled.
After losing almost £1bn in the past two years, the airline said pre-tax losses for the three months to the end of June 
had been £164m. Losses in the same period of 2009 were £148m.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
Putting aside the ash cloud and industrial action, Mr Walsh said BA's underlying financial performance had 
improved. Profit margins rose 13.5 per cent in the quarter from the same period last year, beating some analysts' 
forecasts.
Other airlines were affected by the ash cloud, with Ryanair and EasyJet both reporting related losses in the tens of 
millions of pounds, but only BA had to cope with protracted strikes by flight crew. The impact of the disruptions 
came to £250m in the quarter - in line with the company's previous estimates.
New talks will take place next week between BA and the Unite union in the long-running dispute over cabin crew 
staffing and pay. BA's "final offer" was rejected by the union in July, but Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, said on 
Friday that low turnout at the vote "gives us reason to be optimistic that we've got the basis of a settlement".
Strikes and ash take their toll on BA
"Maybe yields are recovering slightly ahead of where we thought they would, but not a lot," Mr Walsh said. He 
expects smaller increases later in the year, as airlines start adding routes back to their schedules.
BA said the UK pensions regulator had approved its plan to cut its pension deficit. The move should help ease the 
way for its merger with Spanish carrier Iberia next year. Shares in BA rose 1.7 per cent to 219.6p.
If you've got appetite for risk, airlines - hostage to both freak events such as volcanic eruptions and more 
predictable economic downturns - are not a bad place to start. Yet BA is looking a less risky prospect these days. 
The wind seems to have gone out of the union's sails, with less than half of Unite members voting on 
management's latest offer. In the meantime, the cabin crew staffing changes have taken effect, saving the company 
£17m in the first quarter, annualised to almost £70m.
That could make the difference between a small profit and a small loss in 2011. Analysts put BA's year-end 
enterprise value to ebitda anywhere from 4 to 6 and higher. Compared with Air France's EV/ebitda of 6.9, that 
suggests BA might be undervalued.

British Airways suffered another quarter of losses as it was hit by cabin crew strikes and the volcanic ash cloud that 
closed large swathes of European airspace for six days in April.
After losing close to £1bn in the past two years, the flag carrier said on Friday that pre-tax losses for the three 
months to the end of June were £164m. Losses in the same period last year were £148m.
Other airlines were affected by the ash cloud, with Ryanair and EasyJet both reporting related losses in the tens of 
millions of pounds, but only BA had to cope with protracted strikes by flight crews. Willie Walsh, chief executive, 
said on Friday that the disruptions caused £250m of losses in the quarter - in line with the company's previous 
estimates.
New talks may take place between BA and the Unite union in the long-running dispute over cabin crew staffing and 
pay. The airline had made what it called a final offer earlier this month, which was rejected by the union.
Putting aside the ash cloud and industrial action, Mr Walsh said the company's underlying financial performance 
had improved: "The trends in our passenger and cargo traffic continue to be positive with yields up and costs 
down." Revenues for the quarter fell 2.3 per cent from the same period the year before, to £1.94bn. The operating 
loss narrowed to £72m from £94m.
BA's cash balance was £1.74bn, up almost £500m from the same period last year.
Rival Air France-KLM this week beat analysts' expectations on revenues and moved back into profit thanks to a 
one-off gain from the flotation of a Spanish travel reservation company in which it has a stake. US carriers reported 
good results earlier this month, on the back of healthy yields and high capacity.
Strikes and ash cloud take their toll on BA
BA's merger with Spanish carrier Iberia is going forward smoothly. It also plans to start co-ordinating routes and 
pricing this autumn with American Airlines, its partner with Iberia in the Oneworld alliance, following US regulatory 
approval earlier this month.
Analysts expect BA to return to a small profit this financial year, although none predicts the sort of numbers seen 
immediately before the recession hit. In 2008, the airline reported record pre-tax profits of £922m.
"While some economic experts are flagging the risk of a 'double dip' recession, the steady recovery continues and, 
on that basis, we continue to target to break even at a profit before tax level for the full year as we move forward on 
our strategic objectives and continue to build on our excellent customer service," BA said.

A Mobile FortuneThe Life and Times of Denis O'BrienBy Siobhan CreatonAurum £14.99Outside Ireland, Denis 
O'Brien is not as familiar a figure as Michael O'Leary, the puckish chief executive of Ryanair, though they have 
much in common.
From middle-class backgrounds, both cut their teeth working for the late Tony Ryan, founder of Ryanair; both 
accumulated vast fortunes during the Celtic Tiger era; and both are known for their informal yet pugnacious 
business styles. Unlike O'Leary, however, O'Brien opted for tax exile status. And while O'Leary solicits attention 
through tireless self-publicity, within Ireland O'Brien has received less welcome coverage, due to his business 
affairs coming under the scrutiny of the Moriarty Tribunal, which has been investigating payments to politicians 
since 1997.
Over the past decade, O'Brien has become a substantial media proprietor. Ranked by Forbes magazine as the 
258th richest person in the world, O'Brien made most of his $3.5bn net worth from telecoms, primarily through 
Digicel, his Caribbean mobile phone network, hence the title of Siobhan Creaton's timely biography, A Mobile 
Fortune. UK readers, however, are more likely to have heard of O'Brien through his skirmishes with the 
Independent News and Media empire, which recently sold the lossmaking Independent newspapers to Alexander 
Lebedev. O'Brien is the largest shareholder in that company.
Acutely protective of his image, O'Brien did not grant Creaton, a former Irish Times finance correspondent and 
author of a previous book on Ryanair and O'Leary, an interview for this book. She has gained access to many of his 
closest lieutenants, however. Since O'Brien demands total loyalty, such contributions are likely to have had his 
personal blessing and while some are predictably fawning, others are colourful. More colourful still are the 
contributions of those who have fallen foul of the tycoon, since his enmity can be blistering.
Nuanced portrait of an ambitious tycoon
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
Creaton's account opens with a classic O'Brien anecdote about him delaying his Gulfstream jet on the runway to 
haggle over a taxi fare. Although he likes to play the common lad made good, O'Brien's family was comfortably off. 
His father still runs his own horse-care products company, Plusvital.
Apprenticing himself to Ryan in the early 1980s, O'Brien learned the business merits of forensic preparation but 
also of a dictatorial approach to employee relations. When Ryan's mood swings became intolerable, O'Brien quit.
His first two ventures, a teleshopping channel and a national radio licence application, were both failures, but 
O'Brien proved adept at wooing investors and a Dublin radio licence eventually paid dividends.
O'Brien's make-or-break moment was his battle for Ireland's second mobile phone licence in 1995, which he won, 
but which has been mired in controversy ever since.
The Moriarty Tribunal is due to report on the integrity of that process in the near future. If its findings go against 
O'Brien, the fallout may affect the Irish state, which could be sued by the losing consortia. Inevitably, this section of 
the book is the most gripping, not least because it details how incredibly close O'Brien came to going bust while 
chasing the prize that generated the basis of his wealth.
He went on to sell his first mobile phone company, Esat Digifone, to BT for $2.5bn in 2000, allowing him to pocket 
about $400m. Instead of sitting back to enjoy his money, he went on to conquer the Caribbean.
Conscious of the non-Irish market, Creaton tells O'Brien's story in satisfying detail. Her prose is crisp, her approach 
carefully balanced and she keeps events moving. What emerges is a fascinating yet nuanced portrait of an 
extremely ambitious entrepreneur. Creaton quotes his philosophy: "Get big fast. (Damn) the cost. Be brave. Go 
over the cliff. (The competition) doesn't have the balls."
O'Brien apparently still drives around tropical islands testing the signal strength on his old Nokia handset; heaven 
help his employees if it is ever found wanting.

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive has sold 5m of his 60m shares in the budget airline for EUR3.90 a piece.
Analysts remained largely unmoved by the news, noting Mr O'Leary had sold shares before and still remained a 
leading investor.
"We would not read anything major into this move," said RBS analyst, Andrew Lobbenberg. "That said, we have 
seen his sales in the past to be remarkably well timed."
Shares in Ryanair closed down 2.9 per cent at EUR3.83.

A EUR50m ($65m) ash cloud charge conspired with higher fuel costs to cause a dip in first-quarter profits at 
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline.
However, earnings were still better than the market had expected, a fact that combined with an improving fares 
trend to push the shares higher in morning trading on Tuesday.
Ryanair said net profit in the quarter ended June 30 was EUR93.7m, down 24 per cent on the same period in 2009.
The airline railed against the "unnecessary" airspace closures in April and May that followed the eruption of the 
Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland. The disruption caused the cancellation of 9,400 Ryanair flights.
Howard Millar, deputy chief executive and chief financial officer, said about 1.5m passengers had already had their 
tickets refunded, adding that the airline was now focusing on claims for other costs from passengers that were 
stranded by the chaos.
As well as the EUR50m pre-tax ash cloud charge, profits were held back by a 34 per cent year-on-year rise in fuel 
costs. Underlying net profit rose 1 per cent to EUR138.5m. Analysts had on average been expecting EUR128m, Mr 
Millar said.
Sales grew 16 per cent to EUR896.8m. This reflected a 5 per cent increase in average fares and an 8 per cent 
increase in passenger numbers.
Ancillary turnover also moved strongly ahead, partly because the average journey time increased, giving more 
opportunity to buy items during the flight.
Ryanair hit by EUR50m volcanic ash charge
Average fares were expected to increase between 10 and 15 per cent in the second quarter. "In this environment, 
that's a strong performance," said Mr Millar.
The group - which last month proposed returning EUR500m to shareholders through a one-off dividend in October - 
said its outlook for the full year remained "cautious and unchanged", however.
It said it expected underlying net profit for the current financial year to increase between 10 and 15 per cent. 
Ryanair shares rose 1.8 per cent to EUR3.83 in morning trading in London on Tuesday.

Ryanair forecast that fares could rise by as much as 15 per cent over the summer after the low-cost airline reported 
a fall in first-quarter profits, partly caused by the Icelandic volcanic eruption.
Profits for the quarter ending June 30 fell 24 per cent to EUR93.7m (£79m) after plumes of ash from the Icelandic 
volcano led to the closure of European airspace in April and May.
The disruption led to the cancellation of 9,400 Ryanair flights, travel chaos for thousands of passengers and cost 
the airline EUR50m ($65m). But earnings were still better than expected, which, combined with a rise in average 
fares, pushed Ryanair shares higher in early trading. Average fares were expected to rise by between 10 and 15 
per cent in the second quarter, the airline said.
About 1.5m passengers disrupted by the Icelandic volcano have received refunds for their tickets.
Despite initial objections, Ryanair also agreed to cover food and accommodation expenses for customers who 
could not get home after their flights were cancelled.
As well as the EUR50m pre-tax ash cloud charge, profits were held back by a 34 per cent year-on-year rise in fuel 
costs. But this was partly offset by a 5 per cent increase in average fares, an 8 per cent increase in passenger 
numbers and lower airport charges as competition for business increased among European terminals following the 
recession. Underlying net profit rose 1.5 per cent to EUR138.5m, ahead of analysts' expectations of EUR128m. 
Sales rose 16 per cent to EUR896.8m.
Volcano sparks Ryanair fares alert
Ryanair charges passengers for checked-in bags, food and other services, and revenue from these services rose 
strongly, partly because the average journey times lengthened, giving cabin crew more opportunity to sell items 
during the flight.
Revenues from these services now account for 23 per cent of the total.
The group plans to pay its first dividend in October and said its outlook for the full year remained "cautious and 
unchanged". Underlying net profit for the current financial year is expected to increase between 10 and 15 per cent, 
it said.
Ryanair shares closed flat at EUR3.83.
Ryanair has performed well in the downturn as passengers traded down from flag carriers. Its strategy of using 
cheaper airports is paying off, as the 8 per cent fall in airport costs per seat shows.
The hope must be that yields will rise further if and when consumer confidence returns. But given the uncertainty 
over the economy, the shares -trading on 16 times current full-year estimates compared with EasyJet at 15.7 times 
- are already fairly priced.

Ryanair and its chief executive Michael O'Leary "unreservedly apologised" in the High Court to Sir Stelios Haji-
Ioannou, the founder of rival EasyJet, over a series of adverts referring to EasyJet's flight on-time statistics.
In a statement read out to the High Court, Chris Scott, lawyer representing Sir Stelios, told Mr Justice Eady that 
Ryanair's "advertisements featured a picture of the claimant distorted so his nose was elongated in the style of the 
character Pinocchio and referred to him as 'EasyJet - Mr Late Again'".
The adverts were published in two newspapers in January and February this year.
Reading the statement, Mr Scott said: "Now in July, Mr O'Leary and Ryanair accept that the advertisements should 
not have been published referring to Sir Stelios and have made a complete offer to settle his claim."
The Court was also told that Ryanair and Mr O'Leary fully accepted that Sir Stelios "did not lie about the matter".
They also "unreservedly apologised" to Sir Stelios for the statements in the advertisements "insofar as they related 
to him personally and suggested he was lying". Ryanair has also undertaken not to publish the adverts again and 
will pay Sir Stelios damages and legal costs in settlement of his claim.
Mr Scott, reading the statement, told the court that earlier in the year that Sir Stelios had asked Ryanair to withdraw 
the adverts and apologise but they did not and suggested Sir Stelios "should resolve the dispute by a sumo contest 
or by a race around Trafalgar Square".
Sir Stelios later launched his claim for libel claiming the adverts had caused him "significant distress and 
embarrassment".
Sir Stelios wins apology from O'Leary
Ryanair's lawyer told the High Court she had nothing further to add to the statement.
Sir Stelios, who was not in court, said he had accepted £50,100 which he will donate to his philanthropic foundation 
where it will be used for the Stelios award for disabled entrepreneurs in the UK.

Ryanair and its outspoken chief executive Michael O'Leary have "unreservedly apologised" in the High Court to Sir 
Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of rival low-cost airline EasyJet , over a series of advertisements referring to 
EasyJet's flight on-time statistics.
Sir Stelios, one of the UK's best known entrepreneurs, issued a claim for libel after a Ryanair advert featured his 
picture which the High Court heard yesterday was "distorted so his nose was elongated in the style of the character 
Pinocchio and referred to him as "EasyJet's - Mr Late Again'."
The ads, which alleged he had lied, were published in two newspapers and on Ryanair's website in January and 
February this year.
On Thursday in a statement read in open court, Mr O'Leary and Ryanair said they "accept that the advertisements 
should not have been published referring to Sir Stelios" and fully accepted that Sir Stelios "did not lie about the 
matter". They also "unreservedly apologised" to Sir Stelios for the statements in the adverts "insofar as they related 
to him personally and suggested he was lying".
Ryanair and Mr O'Leary said they accepted "that Sir Stelios is not in any way responsible for EasyJet's 
management's continuing failure to publish weekly details of their on-time stats".
Ryanair has also undertaken not to publish the adverts again and will pay Sir Stelios £50,100 damages and legal 
costs. It has also published apologies in adverts taken out in two newspapers.
Sir Stelios, who is a big shareholder in EasyJet, yesterday told the Financial Times that he had launched legal 
action because of the "very serious allegation" in the adverts."

"It's because I had to draw the line somewhere," he said. "I'm glad I took him on."
Sir Stelios, who at the time of the adverts was a non-executive director of EasyJet, added it was "especially unfair 
to pick on me" as he was a non-executive director at the time and did not "micromanage EasyJet".
The entrepreneur has taken out adverts in national newspapers this weekend featuring a cartoon of Mr O'Leary 
attending confession with a priest and apologising to Sir Stelios.
Sir Stelios said yesterday he would donate the £50,100 of libel damages to his philanthropic foundation where it will 
be used for the Stelios award for disabled entrepreneurs in the UK.

Aircraft financing debate to come to a head
Aircraft financing debate to come to a head

The world of aircraft finance is normally far more peaceful than the roaring passenger jets it funds.
But it has become embroiled in a debate that has pitted airlines against governments and united rival manufacturers 
amid a tussle over the role governments play in supporting sales of commercial aircraft via their export credit 
agencies (ECA). This support reached unprecedented levels last year as bank financing dried up as a result of the 
credit crunch.
It rose to more than $20bn in 2009, equal to nearly one-third of the total value of all Boeing and Airbus deliveries, 
and almost double the level in 2008.
"The export credit agencies saved the industry," says Polis Polycarpou, vice-president of the aviation division at 
Frankfurt-based DVB Bank, which specialises in transport finance.
As liquidity remains tight the limits on access to the export credit guarantees have upset many of the world's biggest 
airlines, which say it has led to an unfairly distorted market. This is because of a little-known agreement between 
the US and the European Union dating back to the 1980s that limits which airlines can access export financing.
The issue is due to come to a head in coming months and will be on the minds of many of the executives at the 
UK's biennial Farnborough trade fair, which starts this weekend.
Known as the home market rule it prohibits airlines based in the domestic market of Boeing of the US or Europe's 
Airbus (France, Germany, the UK and Spain) from getting ECA support. Instead these airlines must rely on 
commercial financing, which some complain is more expensive.
Aircraft financing debate to come to a head
These leaves large rivals, such as Dublin-based Ryanair or Dubai's Emirates access to support from the US Export-
Import Bank (Exim) or the three main European agencies: the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department, France's 
Coface and Germany's Hermes.
Earlier this year, leading European airlines barred from access to export credits, including Lufthansa, Air France-
KLM and British Airways, began lobbying their respective governments to tackle the rule.
"This was never an issue two or three years ago," says Chris Partridge, a director in Deutsche Bank's asset 
financing and leasing group. "Then, the likes of Lufthansa and BA could get debt rates which are at the levels 
export credits are today." The dispute has been intensified by the emergence of a rival to Airbus and Boeing's most 
popular single-aisle jets, in the form of Bombardier's planned CSeries aircraft.
Canada never agreed to the home market rule. Nor did potential rivals such as Brazil and China. Boeing and Airbus 
say this is unfair. Bombardier differs. "I think they are trying to protect a favourable position that they have held in 
the market for a long time," says Gary Scott, president of commercial aircraft at Bombardier.
Export credits are expected to take centre stage again this year when Airbus and Boeing, the world's two leading 
aircraft makers, are set to deliver more than 900 passenger jets between them in 2010.
The ECAs stepped in at the start of the credit crunch amid fears that orders would be cancelled leaving hundreds of 
so-called "white tails", aircraft abandoned by their buyers with no new customer.
The notion of forced sales depressing asset values spread during the financial crisis, when the number of banks 
open for aircraft financing business dwindled from about 40 or 50 to "a handful", says Mr Polycarpou. By early 
2009, DVB estimated the so-called "funding gap", the difference between the total value of commercial jet aircraft to 
be delivered and the amount of money likely to be raised to pay for them, was set to reach $17bn.
By year end revised analysis showed a significant drop in the number and value of aircraft deliveries but the white 
tails did not emerge. This year DVB fears the industry still faces a potential funding gap of around $7bn.
The manufacturers dispute this figure.
"I love DVB, they're one of the smartest guys in the aircraft financing world, but this is an area where we have had 
fun duelling," says Kostya Zolotusky, managing director capital markets at Boeing Capital.
"They were predicting in 2009 there would be clouds of white tails and huge funding gaps, and then when that didn't 
happen, everyone said 'Well, the real problem is going to be in 2010'. Well, the data we're looking at continues to 
say things are better than they were a year ago."
Airbus agrees. "Essentially, we foresee no funding gap in 2010," says Nigel Taylor, head of customer finance at 
Airbus, which thinks ECA will again cover a third of its deliveries in 2010.
Whether the manufacturers are right, airlines are still pushing for access to export credit, including those affected by 
the home market rule. The issue has spilt over into separate negotiations being held through the OECD on ECA 
funding terms, which are due to be finalised by the end of the year.

Ryanair says it will not rule out making a third bid for its Irish rival, Aer Lingus, in spite a court ruling on Tuesday 
that Europe's leading competition authorities were right to block its audacious attempt to take over the national 
airline nearly three years ago.
The European General Court, one of Europe's top courts, upheld the European Commission's decisions in that 
case and a separate one brought by Aer Lingus, which was trying to get the Commission to order Ryanair to sell its 
29.8 per cent stake in the older carrier.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the ruling would not stop a future offer for Aer Lingus, though 
"obviously any such offer will have to take account of the court's detailed ruling".
"Ryanair has no immediate plans to make a third offer for Aer Lingus," said Mr O'Leary, adding any such move 
would be unlikely to succeed unless the Irish government sold its 25 per cent stake in the flag carrier.
The two rulings leave Ireland's leading airlines in much the same state of uncertainty they have faced since 
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, rocked Ireland's business establishment with its first bid for Aer Lingus in 
2006, valued at EUR2.80 a share.
The move failed after  the European Commission ruled in 2007 that a take­over would have led to a near-monopoly 
in Ireland and damaged the interests of passengers - the first and last time it has blocked a European airline 
merger.
A second bid by Ryanair in late 2008 at EUR1.40 a share - half the price of the original offer - was grounded after 
the Irish government, Aer Lingus's second-largest shareholder, said it undervalued the airline.
Block on Ryanair takeover bid upheld
Ryanair, which reported a EUR341m ($431m) pre-tax profit and 66.5m passengers in its most recent annual 
results, remains both the fiercest adversary of and largest shareholder in Aer Lingus, which reported a pre-tax loss 
of EUR154m and just over 10m passengers. Mr O'Leary regularly predicts Aer Lingus will go out of business and 
on Monday described it as "a small peripheral regional airline" with declining traffic, fleet, staff numbers and large 
losses.
Aer Lingus has argued that having its largest rival owning such a large stake in it has dragged down the share price 
for other investors - because liquidity in stock is limited - and hampered attempts to forge alliances with other 
airlines.
"It is regrettable that the court has not taken this opportunity to take the further step necessary to address the anti-
competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus which is contrary to the interests of the majority 
of our shareholders," Colm Barrington, Aer Lingus chairman, said yesterday.
Joaquin Almunia, EU competition commissioner, welcomed the court's confirmation of the Commission's decision.

Ryanair and Aer Lingus have lost their separate legal bids to overturn decisions by Europe's top competition 
regulator to block a merger of the Ireland-based airlines.
The European General Court, one of Europe's top courts, on Tuesday upheld the European Commission's 
decisions in both the cases which the two carriers had brought separately over the first of two takeover bids Ryanair 
has made for Aer Lingus since 2006. But it allowed Ryanair to maintain a minority stake in its rival.
The first bid by Ryanair, Aer Lingus's largest shareholder with a stake of 29.8 per cent, ended in mid-2007 when the 
European Commission ruled it would have led to a near-monopoly in the Irish market and damaged the interests of 
passengers.
A second tilt in late 2008 failed after the Irish government, Aer Lingus's next largest shareholder with a 25 per cent 
holding, said the bid undervalued the airline.
Ryanair appealed against the Commission's decision to oppose its first bid, which was the only proposed airline 
merger to be blocked by the Commission up to that point, and none has been blocked since.
Aer Lingus, meanwhile, argued the Commission should have gone further and forced Ryanair to sell its stake once 
it ruled out the takeover bid. The Commission said it lacked the legal authority to do so, but Aer Lingus argued that 
EU merger regulations permitted such a move.
Aer Lingus was concerned that having its largest rival owning such a large stake had dragged down the share price 
for other investors - because liquidity in its stock is limited - and had hampered managers' attempts to forge 
strategic alliances with other airlines.
Ryanair and Aer Lingus lose EU takeover case
But on Tuesday the General Court confirmed both of the Commission's decisions. On the first score, the court said 
that none of the arguments put forward by Ryanair was capable of calling into question the Commission's findings 
that the merger would have significantly impeded competition on routes from or to Dublin, Cork and Shannon. 
Those dominant positions were either monopolistic or very significant, the court said.
With regard to Aer Lingus' case, the court said that the acquisition of a non-controlling shareholding did not amount 
to "a merger which has already arisen" - which would be the grounds on which the Commission was entitled to act.
Had Ryanair been successful, questions about whether it would launch a third bid for Aer Lingus could have been 
revived although Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, had played down such speculation.

Ryanair and Aer Lingus are braced for European court rulings on Tuesday that could open the way for the budget 
airline to make a third bid for its older Irish rival.
Each airline is awaiting a decision from the European General Court on cases the two have brought separately over 
the first of two takeover bids Ryanair has made for Aer Lingus since 2006.
The first bid by Ryanair, Aer Lingus's largest shareholder with a stake of 29.8 per cent, ended in mid-2007 when the 
European Commission ruled it would have led to a near-monopoly in the Irish market and damaged the interests of 
passengers.
A second tilt in late 2008 failed after the Irish government, Aer Lingus's next largest shareholder with a 25 per cent 
holding, said it undervalued the airline.
Ryanair appealed against the commission's decision to oppose its first bid, which was the only proposed airline 
merger to be blocked by the commission before or since.
Aer Lingus, meanwhile, has argued the commission should have gone further and forced Ryanair to sell its stake 
once it ruled out the takeover bid. The commission said it lacked the legal authority to do this, but Aer Lingus 
argues EU merger regulations permit such a move.
Aer Lingus has been concerned that having its largest rival owning such a large stake has dragged down the share 
price for other investors - because liquidity in stock is limited - and hampered managers' attempts to forge strategic 
alliances with other airlines.
Key day in court for Ryanair and Aer Lingus
A ruling either way in each case is potentially significant, but if Ryanair is successful it will revive questions about 
whether it would launch a third bid for Aer Lingus.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, played down such speculation. "We would have no immediate plans to 
launch a bid for Aer Lingus. We have said there's no point in us doing it until the government decides to sell," he 
told the FT on Monday.
Mr O'Leary said he believed the bid by Europe's largest low-cost carrier had been treated differently to that of other 
airlines.
"They didn't apply the same rules to us," he said, pointing to airline mergers permitted before and since the Aer 
Lingus ruling, such as Iberia's acquisition of the two Spanish low-cost airlines Vueling and Clickair.
Mr O'Leary said the commission also should have considered that, although Ryanair and Aer Lingus dominate the 
critical Dublin-London market, the two airlines primarily fly to different airports - Stansted in the case of Ryanair and 
Heathrow for Aer Lingus - meaning a merger would not have reduced competition to "any degree".
In her 2007 ruling on the first Ryanair bid, the then competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said the case differed 
from previous airline mergers as it was the first time the commission had to assess a merger of two main airlines in 
a single country, both operating from the same home airport - Dublin. In addition, the number of overlapping routes 
was "unprecedented compared with previous airline cases".
Aer Lingus declined to comment ahead of the court rulings.

Ryanair to cut winter capacity in UK by 16%
Ryanair to cut winter capacity in UK by 16%

Ryanair is to cut capacity in the UK by 16 per cent this winter as it shifts its aircraft to countries with cheaper 
airports and lower passenger taxes such as Spain.
Europe's biggest budget airline said it would reduce the number of aircraft at its main UK base of Stansted, where it 
is by far the biggest carrier, from 24 last winter to 22. According to Michael O'Leary, chief executive, the capacity 
cuts would result in the loss of 2,500 jobs at the airport in a full year and 1.5m passengers between November and 
March 2011.
The airline also plans to cut winter flights at most of its other UK bases except for Edinburgh and Leeds Bradford.
"These are real losses to the UK," said Mr O'Leary. "This is a time in winter when we should be bringing more 
people here, particularly to London."
Stansted played down his claims. "Last winter they said there would be a reduction in passenger numbers of about 
2.5m and it turned out to be about 300,000, which was largely due to the economic downturn."
Mr O'Leary, sporting a German football top three days after England's World Cup exit, also lashed out at the new 
UK transport secretary, Philip Hammond, who told the Financial Times that UK domestic flights would become "a 
thing of the past" as they were replaced by trains.
"If he thinks the future is more trains, then sorry Mr Hammond you just haven't a bloody clue," said Mr O'Leary. "It's 
time to stop pandering to the environmental goons and start addressing how you're going to make Britain a more 
attractive tourism destination."
Ryanair to cut winter capacity in UK by 16%
Mr O'Leary also said his counterpart at British Airways, Willie Walsh, had done a "fantastic job" of fighting striking 
BA cabin crew, though if Mr O'Leary had been running BA, "I would have sacked them all long ago".
The UK capacity cuts, which may be followed by others in Ireland, are similar to those it has announced in recent 
years for Stansted, where it says its aircraft numbers have fallen from a peak of about 30 in 2007/08 to the 22 
planned for this coming winter.
Analysts said this was in line with the airline's refinement of a business model focused on relentlessly paring back 
costs.

Flying within the UK is heading for extinction, the transport secretary, Philip Hammond has claimed.
"Domestic flying in the UK will become in time a thing of the past," he told the FT in an interview on the new 
government's plans for aviation.
Mr Hammond, whose government has banned new runways at the country's three largest airports, Heathrow, 
Gatwick and Stansted, says fast train links will be critical to addressing growing demand for air travel.
But several airlines cast doubt on the idea domestic flights would become extinct, not least the country's largest 
domestic operator, Flybe.
"UK domestic aviation will be unaffected by the limited, London-centric nature of any high-speed rail investment that 
might be forthcoming over the next few decades," it said.
"Indeed, there is a very strong argument that aviation which serves regions like the West Midlands and the north-
west will actually see an increase in demand as a result of high speed rail." BA also dismissed the idea that 
domestic flights would end. "There will still be demand from people in the UK regions who want to fly into the hub 
airport of Heathrow, particularly if the high speed rail links don't link directly to Heathrow," it said.
A Ryanair spokesman said air passengers would not switch to rail in the UK "because the trains are so slow and so 
expensive". Both Ryanair and its budget rival EasyJet said the more pressing issue for the government was 
reforming the UK's air passenger duty.
Minister says domestic flights 'thing of the past'
Executives from other airlines, who did not wish to be named, said there was still a thriving domestic aviation 
industry in Germany and France, which had the best high-speed rail networks in Europe.
One executive added that it took each country decades to build these networks, in times of stronger growth, 
meaning it was unlikely the UK would see such infrastructure soon.
Asked how else the country might answer the need for greater airport capacity, Mr Hammond talked of the smarter 
use of airspace and "spare capacity in the Stansted runway".
But for a more comprehensive policy response, we must await the results of an aviation working group he set up 
earlier this month to look at making Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted what he likes to call "better not bigger" 
airports.
This will take time, which is a happy prospect for most of what are known in the industry as the Flap airports: 
Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Paris.
For years the acronym has described Europe's leading airports - with the later addition of Madrid, where passenger 
numbers overtook Amsterdam's in 2007.
Heathrow has long been the clear leader in terms of passengers. But its supremacy is under threat. The other four 
now have more runways and only one - Madrid - is as poorly served by high speed or national rail as Heathrow.
Over the past 20 years Heathrow has dropped from first to fifth in Europe in term of destinations served, as it has 
grown more congested and its rivals have boosted capacity. The number of UK regional cities Heathrow serves has 
shrunk from 21 to six.
It is also slipping in terms of its services to fast-growing markets such as Brazil, where it lags behind Paris and 
Madrid; and China, where it comes fourth after Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam, according to research 
commissioned by the British Chambers of Commerce. And now, following the government's runway decision, many 
say future air travel demand will drift to Heathrow's rivals, a fact some of them candidly welcome.
"It is good news for us," said María Jesús Luengo of Aena, the state-owned operator of Madrid's Barajas airport, 
which has four runways to Heathrow's two. "It will bring to Madrid more activity and more economic growth."
Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, which has five runways, also expects to see gains from London's decision. "In the 
long run, there will be a very gradual shift of traffic finding it more difficult to use London airports," said Marcel 
Lekker-kerk, Schiphol's director of aviation marketing.
There is puzzlement among some in the aviation industry about why Heathrow is not getting another runway when 
the economic case is to their mind so clear.
Frankfurt airport's operator, Fraport, which expects hourly movements - take-offs and landings - to gradually 
increase by 50 per cent once its new fourth runway opens next year [EDS: 2011], says the need for the extra 
capacity was obvious.
"Our case has been that we need the new runway to maintain our current position and to strengthen the airport for 
the future, and without the new runway we would see traffic over time gravitate elsewhere," says Fraport 
spokesman Robert Payne.
"Certainly in the immediate surrounding communities it was controversial, but the overall consensus was it was a 
positive for economic reasons; job creation and for securing the future of the airport as a major hub with the 
competitive pressure we have in Europe and the Gulf regions."
Heathrow's owner, BAA, which has been asked to join Mr Hammond's working group along with airlines and 
relevant authorities, is diplomatic about the situation. "We respect the position of the new government," it said, 
adding the group was an "enthusiastic" supporter of integrated high-speed rail.
Minister says domestic flights 'thing of the past'
But BAA said it still believes there is a shortage of airport capacity and meeting this need would strengthen trading 
links.

If you had to come up with a collective noun for a bunch of airline people, what would it be? A flock? A formation? A 
swarm? Sometimes, especially after a day or two at a large air industry gathering, I start to think of other words, 
such as a "moan" or a "fret" or a "whinge". There is an old joke in the business that the whine you hear in an aircraft 
after the engines are turned off is just the pilots talking. But these days, the pilots are not alone. Consider the blast 
of grievance emitted two weeks ago in Berlin at the annual general meeting of the International Air ­Transport 
Association, the body that acts for most of the world's oldest and best-known airlines. In front of hundreds of airline 
executives, ­Giovanni ­Bisignani, Iata's vivacious Italian chief, launched an assault on the "national embarrassment" 
of overcharging airports; the "shortsighted nonsense" of striking crews; and, to cheers from his audience, the 
"leeches" in travel reservation companies.
That was before he got to the "unco-ordinated bureaucratic mess" in Europe, where authorities shut down airspace 
for nearly six days because of the menace of a volcanic ash cloud from Iceland that many airlines say never 
existed.
Listening to him, it struck me that the last time I heard so much complaining, it came not from an airline boss but a 
passenger. One of the great paradoxes of modern flight is that so many more of us do it, yet so few of us seem to 
enjoy it. The world of aviation has come a long way since Howard Hughes was showing off his latest plane to 
Katharine Hepburn and ­people dressed up to go to the airport. Today, there are terrorists with explosives in their 
underpants and airline bosses such as Ryanair's Michael O'Leary who wants to charge people to use the lavatory, 
and says he would "wipe their bums for a fiver".
So what comes next? Will anything change? Or do the people making the decisions that will shape the future of 
flying think today's trends will merely become more marked?
Can the airline industry recover?
. . .
It is now 16 years since the billionaire investor Warren Buffett said capitalism would have been better off if Orville 
Wright had been shot down at Kitty Hawk in 1903, because the industry had made a net loss ever since. Things 
have only grown worse. Over the past decade, airlines have lost another $50bn thanks to the September 11 
terrorist attacks, ­soaring fuel prices and recession. The situation is especially awful for many of the household-
name international carriers in Europe and the US. Every other week seems to bring news of a real or longed-for 
merger as they ­struggle to fend off sprightly no-frills rivals, striking workers and deep-pocketed Middle East 
newcomers.
Last year, the biggest airline in the world in terms of the number of passengers carried was not the American 
Airlines of George Clooney's hit film Up in the Air, or even its giant rival Delta, but Dallas-based budget carrier 
Southwest Airlines. The fifth biggest was Southwest's rambunctious Irish love child, Ryanair. These airlines fly 
shorter distances compared with international companies such as British Airways. But unlike BA, which has lost 
nearly £1bn over the past two years, they have stayed profitable. And their rise has made flying possible for 
millions.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
Yet on several counts, air travel is the only form of mass transport to have gone backwards over the past 10 years. 
Trains go faster. Cars are smarter. Bikes are lighter and bike paths more numerous. Buses are still late and you can 
never get a seat at rush hour, but the windows are bigger and seats more comfortable. Aircraft travel, on the other 
hand, has grown appreciably worse on a number of important measures. Most obviously, post-9/11 ­security checks 
and ever more exotic ploys to extract extra money from the unwary passenger have turned flying into a maddening 
experience.
Low-cost airlines at least make no pretence about being low cost. But their tactics are now aped by older, cash-
strapped carriers that still ­promote themselves as full-service. It is especially grim in economy class. Air France is 
one of a number of airlines that has squeezed extra seats up the back of the aircraft after bringing in new "premium 
economy" seating, in between business class and economy.
There is another, even stranger, reason that flying has gone backwards. In a world used to rapid technical progress, 
you cannot fly as fast as you could a decade ago. And that's because the supersonic passenger jet is dead. Before 
Concorde took its last flight in 2003, it was possible to cross the Atlantic in just over three hours. It is true that only 
the wealthy could afford such flights. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways, which used to fly 
Concorde, along with Air France, says only a "handful" of the aircraft were ever made and the number who flew on 
them was "tiny". It is also true, as the rise of the budget giants shows, that millions more passengers can now afford 
to fly than ever could before. And if Iata's projections are correct, the number of passenger departures will grow 
from 2.3 billion last year to 16 billion by 2050.
The problem is that, in a world of Moore's law - shorthand for the ­computer industry's ability to produce 
progressively more powerful and cheaper technology over the past 50 years - many people expect their flights to be 
better. "Most of the time, capitalism has managed to produce cheaper goods at a higher quality," says author Alain 
de Botton, an aviation enthusiast and recent writer-in-residence at Heathrow. "I think the airline ­industry is a 
worrying exception: it's cheaper but worse quality."
"It's a surprising trend too," he adds, "because of the lack of apology. Imagine if a car manufacturer said 'we're 
going to make this cheap product and we're going to glory in its ­shoddiness'."
. . .
I have raised these complaints about modern air travel with a number of senior figures in the aviation industry, and I 
think it is fair to say that most of them looked as if I had just asked if they would like to step outside for a quick puff 
of crack. It is not that they are unaware of their ­customers' complaints. It is just that they are far more focused on 
Can the airline industry recover?
two other sweeping trends in air transport that many of us take for granted: the steep fall in fare prices and rise in 
safety.
Over a lunch of curried sausages in Berlin, Alan Joyce, the head of ­Australia's Qantas, told me that when his 
airline started flying abroad in 1935, a trip from Sydney to London cost the equivalent of 122 weeks of an average 
person's salary and took several days. "Today it is just over one week's salary and takes 23 hours."
Christoph Mueller, chief executive of Ireland's Aer Lingus, put it like this: "In 1961, a first-class ticket from Frankfurt 
to New York and back cost the same as a new Mercedes-Benz 190D. Today, you have to pay 13 times as much for 
a new Mercedes as you do for the same first-class ticket." Few see the trend reversing soon.
In addition, flying has become much safer, even if it does not always seem to be. As Iata's Giovanni Bisignani 
points out: "When Iata started 60 years ago, we had roughly nine million passengers and 247 fatalities. Last year, 
we carried 2.3 billion passengers and there were 685 fatalities." This is because safety standards, aircraft and the 
equipment on them have become much more advanced. The founder of BMI, Sir Michael Bishop, one of the most 
respected figures in the business, puts it more directly: "Pilots don't like to hear this, but the truth of the matter is 
that by giving them less to do, it has actually made the industry considerably safer."
Yet passengers' complaints stand, even if they look trivial next to matters of affordability and safety. Will they get a 
hearing in the near future?
A lot of frequent fliers are fond of thinking that the future of air travel might look like Canada's Porter Airlines, an 
upstart carrier that flies from Toronto's Billy Bishop airport, just moments from the city's downtown centre (imagine 
an airport practically at the foot of St Paul's in London or the Empire State Building in New York). Porter's check-in 
desks look more like those of a boutique hotel. Its lounge offers free espresso from Franke coffee makers and a 
bank of Apple Mac computers for free internet ­browsing. Onboard food is free. Baggage allowances are generous.
But whether this is the future of flying is unclear: earlier this month, Porter backed off from plans to raise fresh 
capital with an initial public offering. As one investor told Reuters, the landscape is littered with the corpses of 
airlines that provide great service.
Meanwhile, one thing seems certain: flying is unlikely to get faster. After Concorde was grounded, several 
companies said they would develop a replacement. None has done so, so far. And none is likely to, according to 
Peter Morris, chief economist at the Ascend Worldwide aviation consultancy. Several years ago, he explains, Airbus 
and Boeing, the world's two biggest passenger jet manufacturers, tried to figure out if the next big thing in aircraft 
should be another super-fast jet or another great big one, like ­Boeing's iconic 747 jumbo. "Boeing went for neither 
and Airbus went for one of them," says Morris - the A380 superjumbo that began flying in 2005. The reason was 
economics: "The industry wants lower costs per seat rather than faster seats," he says. "It went for the less risky 
thing."
Is the future, alternatively, in space? Sir Richard Branson's plans for commercial space travel are advancing, but 
are still some way from lift-off.
In the meantime, many people hope to see the aggravation of the airport security check diminish. Advances in body 
screening technology, say many airlines, could eventually see an end to the rigmarole of having to take off your 
shoes, belt, watch and anything else that goes beep, though the widespread introduction of such devices is still 
some way off.
More hopefully, flying is on the verge of becoming greener. Aircraft used to be made of wood, then aluminium, and 
now, at both Boeing and Airbus, they are going plastic - or rather, carbon fibre-reinforced plastic composites, light, 
tough material you might see in fishing rods or golf clubs. Large parts of Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner passenger 
jet, which is due to begin commercial flights in about six months, and Airbus's A350, due more than two years later, 
are being made of composites. Both manufacturers are promising dramatic fuel cost savings, and airlines have 
been ­enthusiastic. The Dreamliner, with more than 850 orders, has been the world's fastest-selling new aircraft.
Can the airline industry recover?
. . .
Boeing is promising a whole new passenger experience on the Dreamliner, too, as I discovered in April on a visit to 
the company's Seattle assembly plants, where there is a mock-up of the new aircraft's interior. "It's like a limousine!" 
enthused Kenneth Price, the marketing executive who ­ushered me into the cabin. "We wanted to take people back 
to the magic of ­flying - that feeling of the first time you ever flew."
Whether this happens remains to be seen, but the Dreamliner certainly looks different. The first thing you notice is 
the striking LED lighting - ­coloured sky blue the day I visited - which makes the interior feel higher and brighter. 
The windows are bigger and instead of sliding shutters, ­dimmer switches make them darker or lighter. Boeing also 
claims people will leave a 787 flight feeling less dehydrated and headachy, because the composite construction will 
allow higher humidity and increased pressure, so you will feel as if you are at 6,000ft rather than the normal 8,000ft.
Jim Albaugh, who runs Boeing's commercial aircraft division, is equally optimistic about another green trend in 
aviation once thought wildly unlikely to come to much: biofuels. "Without going too far out on a limb, if I were to look 
into the future I could see us operating 100 per cent biofuel," he told me in Berlin. The last two and a half years 
have seen a big jump in the number of airlines testing fuels derived from ingredients such as algae and coconut oil. 
There are still stumbling blocks, especially price, but if Albaugh is correct, it could reshape the industry.
Whether this makes us less guilty about flying is another matter. But the future could start to look very different for 
airlines, and all of us who fly with them. Instead of being so unprofitable that every shock leaves them struggling to 
survive, airlines might become more financially hardy. That in turn could lower the endless round of cost-cuts. 
Which in turn could reduce strikes and improve service. It is not too difficult to imagine that stronger airlines might 
have more heft in persuading airport owners and governments to improve creaking infrastructure and tackle 
security hold-ups. There is even, just possibly, a chance that flying could become fun again.

In the early days of EasyJet, an agitated customer telephoned the UK-based airline and demanded to speak to 
Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder. The customer explained that he had booked his honeymoon flights on the airline 
some months before, but the wedding was now off.
Mr Haji-Ioannou said that EasyJet had a no-refunds policy but, given the circumstances, he was prepared to relent. 
"Oh, I don't want a refund," the customer said. "I want to change the name of the person I am travelling with."
Mr Haji-Ioannou agreed and began offering an additional service: change the name of the person travelling - for a 
fee.
Sir Stelios, as he now is, told the story at a recent Financial Times event to celebrate our business school rankings. 
Afterwards, we had a laugh about the article I wrote 15 years ago, expressing scepticism about whether the newly 
launched EasyJet would make it.
Scepticism is the journalist's default position, just as optimism is the entrepreneur's. Given Sir Stelios's intelligence, 
his careful planning and the backing he had arranged through his shipping tycoon father, I was not really that 
surprised to see him turn EasyJet into one of Europe's two great cut-price airlines alongside Ryanair.
But I would have been astonished if I had been told that Sir Stelios would one day appear in the High Court in 
London, suing his own company for selling too many of those additional services. Last week, he stepped into the 
witness box to complain that EasyJet was violating the terms of its brand licence agreement, which limits the 
amount of money it can make from ancillary services to 25 per cent of income.
Entrepreneurs need to know when to let go
The case hinges on the definition of "ancillary". Are baggage charges and speedy boarding fees core or ancillary? 
In court, Sir Stelios said that even aircraft toilets were ancillary on the grounds that some small aircraft did not have 
them.
Under cross-examination, Sir Stelios conceded it would be "stupid" to charge passengers to use aircraft toilets. 
Some would apply the same description to his case. As any business school student knows, selling ancillary 
services is one of the ways budget airlines make money. Low fares are the bait to get customers to spend more - 
on food, hotels or car hire. As Sir Stelios and his siblings still own nearly 38 per cent of EasyJet, you would think he 
would want the airline to sell as many services as possible.
So what is he playing at? First, he has other interests. EasyGroup, his private company, owns and licenses the 
"easy" brand, which appears on everything from EasyCar to EasyHolidays. Ancillary offerings by EasyJet threaten 
to cramp these businesses.
Second, Sir Stelios appears to have a bad case of "founder's disease" - a reluctance to let go. Noam Wasserman of 
Harvard Business School wrote in a 2008 Harvard Business Review article: "New ventures are usually labours of 
love for entrepreneurs, and they become emotionally attached to them, referring to the business as 'my baby'." But 
from the moment founders bring in outside investors, their jobs are at risk. In an analysis of 212 US start-ups, 
Professor Wasserman discovered that by the time the ventures were three years old, 50 per cent of the founders 
were no longer chief executive. By the time of the companies' initial public offerings, only 25 per cent of the 
founders were still leading them. Most had been forced out.
Initially, Sir Stelios showed signs of avoiding founder's disease. In 2002, two years after EasyJet's stock market 
listing, he stepped down as chairman, saying entrepreneurs were not the best people to run publicly-quoted 
companies. But he has been involved in regular spats with EasyJet's board and management since, particularly 
over what he saw as the airline's over-ambitious aircraft purchasing plans. Last month he resigned from the board, 
complaining that he had been "constantly out-voted".
Some founders have avoided this fate. Sir Richard Branson has held on to his empire by, for the most part, steering 
clear of the stock markets. His Virgin Group had an unhappy period as a listed company in the 1980s before he 
took it private again - although Virgin does have minority stakes in two stock market-quoted companies, Virgin 
Media and Virgin Blue, the Australian airline.
Rupert Murdoch has kept family control of his publicly-quoted News Corp though a complex voting structure and is 
now trying to buy the 61 per cent stake his group does not already own in British Sky Broadcasting, the television 
company he created.
Sir Stelios could learn from these more seasoned business builders. He should either buy the rest of EasyJet and 
run it his way or sell out and leave its managers to run it. His baby has grown up and left home.

EasyJet brand dispute looms

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou begins his fight in the High Court on Monday with EasyJet, which he founded 15 years ago, 
in a brand dispute which could have far reaching implications for the airline.
The case, set to last two weeks, may also expose boardroom tensions at EasyJet as the High Court hears 
arguments on the meaning of a brand licence agreement made when the airline floated in 2000 which limits the 
amount it can make from so-called ancillary services to 25 per cent of total income.
The court is expected to hear evidence from Sir Stelios, the airline's biggest shareholder, and Andy Harrison, 
EasyJet's outgoing chief executive.
The brand licence agreement - for which Sir Stelios is paid royalties of £1 ($1.46) a year - was made to ensure that 
EasyJet did not turn into a conglomerate that could swamp his EasyGroup businesses, including EasyCar.
EasyGroup owns the "easy" brand and licenses it to other ventures as well as to EasyJet. If Sir Stelios wins the 
case, EasyJet could be be liable to pay him additional royalties.
The High Court case is likely to centre around whether baggage charges, speedy boarding charges and 
sandwiches sold on board are ancillary services or core services.
Sir Stelios has argued that the airline is above the 25 per cent limit on ancillary revenues due to growth in these 
types of services.
He has asked the court to determine the issue so an audit can be carried out, examining whether the limit has been 
breached.
EasyJet brand dispute looms
Meanwhile, it has emerged that Sir Stelios is fighting a second legal battle. He is suing rival Ryanair and its chief 
executive Michael O'Leary for libel over an advertisement published by Ryanair in January and February.
In a claim form filed in the High Court, Sir Stelios alleges his nose was "digitally altered" in the photograph used in 
the advert "so as to grotesquely elongate its tip" which "is immediately reminiscent and/or evocative of the well-
known children's character, Pinocchio, whose nose famously grew every time he told a lie".
The writ claims: "The depiction of someone's nose lengthening in this way is therefore synonymous in the minds of 
the public with his being a liar."
Sir Stelios, who is being represented by libel lawyers Schillings, claims that the words and photograph of the advert 
in their ordinary meaning or by way of innuendo "meant and were understood to mean that the claimant had 
deliberately and dishonestly chosen to stop publication of 'on-time' statistics on the EasyJet website".
According to the writ, Sir Stelios is seeking unlimited damages as well as an injunction to prevent the words being 
re-published.

Dividends are in the news. On Wednesday two Democratic senators told BP it shouldn't pay a dividend until the 
total cost of the oil spill clean-up is estimated. Earlier, European airline Ryanair announced a first-ever cash 
payment to shareholders. Global coffee shop chain Starbucks also paid an inaugural dividend last month. Few 
things in finance, however, are as misunderstood and debated as dividends.
For all the hoo-ha about Starbucks, or Dow Chemical's first dividend cut since 1912 last year, investors should 
recall the classic 1958 paper by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller, which argued that a company's dividend 
policy was irrelevant. There were many assumptions, of course, but simplistically shareholders should be indifferent 
between a dividend and a stronger share price due to higher free cash flows.
If dividends are irrelevant, should investors just ignore the finger-pointing at BP or Ryanair's first cheque? The issue 
at BP is that there is a chance (admittedly small for now) that future claims on the company will exceed its ability to 
pay them. Whereas BP has unlimited liabilities, individual shareholders risk only their stock falling to zero. The 
asymmetric risk of paying a dividend, therefore, might be seen to be what lawyers call fraudulent transfer. If BP 
wants to maintain pay-outs, it must argue there is almost zero risk of default.
Debut-dividends at the likes of Starbucks are more difficult to interpret. Again, the theory shrugs. But Modigliani and 
Miller's model assumes operating cash flows are independent of dividend policy. Some believe, however, that 
higher pay-out ratios signal that management is short of profitable investment opportunities. Other studies show 
rising dividends to be bullish. Investors are best advised to ignore the debate and concentrate on a company's free 
cash flows instead.

BA losses fail to put off investors
BA losses fail to put off investors

The price of the cabin crew strikes at British Airways was laid bare on Thursday as the airline revealed that last 
month's walkouts have been costing it £7m a day and saw passenger numbers tumble sharply.
On a day when BA's rivals, Air France-KLM and Ryanair, reported a jump in passenger numbers in line with 
improving economic conditions, the UK airline's overall numbers fell 14 per cent in May compared with the same 
month a year ago.
The size of the daily losses is higher than the £5.5m BA last reported it was losing each day during an earlier round 
of flight attendant strikes in March, when it was running fewer flights because of the winter season. The airline's 
load factors - a measure of how full its aircraft are - also fell more than five points to just under 70 per cent.
However, a number of investors contacted by the Financial Times on Thursday remained broadly sanguine about 
the long-term effect of the stoppages, which are due to last at least another five days from Saturday and may 
continue through the summer.
Regulatory disclosures show some leading BA investors, such as Aegon Asset Management, have increased their 
holdings in the airline over the past week, when thousands of cabin crew were in the middle of their latest three five-
day walkouts.
This was because BA's underlying performance remained strong, Stephen Adams, Aegon's head of UK equities, 
said. "We wouldn't be adding to our shareholding if we didn't believe in the management and the long-term future of 
the company," he said.
BA losses fail to put off investors
Other investors without a  stake in the company said even the prospect of strikes lasting through the busiest 
summer months would be bearable as long as it brought about a permanent reduction in staff costs.
"BA really doesn't have a choice," Paul Owens, a member of the fixed-income team at the Liontrust investment 
management group, said. "They have extremely high labour costs and they have to address those costs." Mr 
Owens said the risks for Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, were high. "But I think he will win and I think he will serve 
as a model for other managers."
Mr Walsh and leaders of the Unite union that represents BA's 13,400 cabin crew have held a series of talks to try to 
resolve the row over the last two weeks, but both sides said  no fresh talks had been scheduled.
BA recently reported a £531m pre-tax loss, its worst annual deficit since it was privatised in 1987.

Ryanair to pay first dividend since flotation

Ryanair yesterday revealed plans to pay its first dividend since it was floated more than a decade ago in a move 
that will enrich Michael O'Leary, its outspoken chief executive, by nearly EUR20m (£17m).
The Dublin-based budget airline announced the payment as it reported it had swung from a record loss a year ago 
to one of the largest profits any European airline has made during the economic downturn.
Shares in Ryanair closed up 7 per cent at EUR3.53 yesterday after Mr O'Leary, who owns more than 4 per cent of 
the airline and repeated that he had no plans to retire before 2012, forecast another rise in profits this year.
He has suggested the company might start returning cash to shareholders by 2012 or 2013 after talks to buy 200 
new aircraft from Boeing broke down.
Although some had interpreted his comments as a negotiating ploy with the US aircraft manufacturer, he said the 
airline now proposed to return EUR500m to shareholders, or 34 cents a share, in the form of a one-off dividend in 
October.
Another EUR500m could be returned to shareholders by the end of the 2013 financial year, either in a new dividend 
or share buy-backs.
"Most people thought it would never happen," he said, adding Ryanair's strategy had the "great upside" of driving 
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of rival low-cost airline EasyJet, "absolutely bloody nuts".
Sir Stelios, EasyJet's largest shareholder, has been fighting the airline's management over their expansion plans 
and reluctance to pay a dividend quickly.
Ryanair to pay first dividend since flotation
Sir Stelios said he was glad to see Mr O'Leary proposing a dividend, adding: "I hope Carolyn McCall [incoming 
EasyJet chief executive] and Mike Rake [chairman] are watching this closely."

Sir Stelios said he was glad to see Mr O'Leary proposing a dividend, adding: "I hope Carolyn McCall [incoming 
EasyJet chief executive] and Mike Rake [chairman] are watching this closely."
In contrast to full-service flag carriers such as British Airways or Air France-KLM, which have both reported large 
losses, under IFRS accounting standards Ryanair made a pre-tax profit of EUR341m in the 12 months to the end of 
March. Revenues rose 2 per cent to EUR2.9bn, and passenger numbers rose 14 per cent to 66.5m. Earnings per 
share rose from 7.1 cents to 21.59 cents.
Last year, Ryanair made a pre-tax loss of EUR180.5m, its first loss since it floated in 1997, after it took a 
EUR222.5m write-off on the value of its stake in Irish rival, Aer Lingus, whose share price plunged after Ryanair 
made a failed takeover bid for it.
"This is a robust set of numbers in a difficult market," said Joe Gill of Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin, who said the 
main reason was Ryanair's ability to "keep their unit costs at industry lows".
