WARSAW (AFX) - Centralwings CEO Piotr Kociolek said the low-cost subsidiary of Lot Polish Airlines is planning a 
rapid expansion into the British and Irish markets, the Funancial Tiomes reported.
Kociolek said that five of the six routes it is adding in its summer schedule next year will be between Poland and the 
UK and Ireland, which will account for about 60 pct of Centralwings' capacity and forecast traffic in 2006.
The expanding market reflects the growing travel needs of Polish workers in both countries, as well as rising leisure 
and business traffic.

Ryanair to change policy on blind, partially-sighted passengers
Ryanair to change policy on blind, partially-sighted passengers

LONDON (AFP) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is to change its policy on carrying blind and 
partially-sighted passengers following criticism for ejecting a group of blind travellers from a flight.
Any vision-impaired passenger accompanied by a sighted companion would now no longer be required to inform 
the airline in advance, the Irish carrier announced in what it called a 'commonsense change'.
But those travelling alone would remain part of its limit on four reduced-mobility passengers per flight, said Ryanair.
Disabled groups criticised Ryanair last month after a group of nine blind and partially-sighted people were taken off 
an Italy-bound flight at Stansted airport in September.
The airline said at the time the four-person quota had been reached. It denied discrimination and said it was only 
complying with safety guidelines that require aircraft to be evacuated within 90 seconds in case of emergency.
The new rules follow consultation with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland.
The change is subject to approval from the Irish Aviation Authority but the airline anticipates they will be given the 
go-ahead in the coming weeks, a Ryanair spokeswoman added.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) -- Shares of Europe's largest airlines soared Wednesday in U.S. trading on strong 
earnings and positive broker feedback.
The Bank of New York Europe American Depositary Receipt index was up 0.27 point at 131.42, the weakest sub-
regional index, and the overall Composite Index was 0.56 point higher at 131.65.
In afternoon trading, U.S. stocks extended gains, helped by a fall in oil prices following a rise in energy stockpiles.
Air France-KLM shares rose as much as 6.3%, or $1.08, to $18.24 after the airline said second-quarter profit more 
than tripled to 717 million euros ($848 million), or 2.73 euros a share, from 195 million euros, or 76 euro cents a 
share, a year earlier.
British Airways gained as much as 73 cents, or 1.4%, after Deutsche Bank analysts downgraded U.K. low-cost 
carrier easyJet and said they prefer British Airways.
Shares of Ireland's no-frills Ryanair Holdings slid as much as 46 cents to $51.34.
In other broker action, shares of France Telecom jumped as much as 3.4%, or 86 cents, to $25.84 after Lehman 
Brothers said it's a favorite pick in the European telecom sector.
Other fixed-line providers rose more modestly. Deutsche Telekom shares picked up as much as 11 cents to $17.06. 
Spain's Telefonica was 1% higher at $44.31.
While mixed overall, the pharmaceutical sector enjoyed some of strongest advances.
Astrazeneca shares rose as much as 2.3%, or $1.06, to $45.82, after the drug giant said it has started recruiting for 
a pivotal study for non-small-cell lung cancer.
Shares of the U.K.'s Skyepharma surged as much as 5.7%, or 53 cents, to $9.75 on speculation that it may be in 
line for a bid from Switzerland's Novartis .
Other top gainers included Elan Corp. and Switzerland's Serono , both rose more than 2%.

ROUNDUP easyJet cheers with FY pretax up 9 pct and current year guidance
ROUNDUP easyJet cheers with FY pretax up 9 pct and current year guidance

LONDON (AFX) - easyJet PLC, Europe's second largest no-frills airline, reported a better-than-expected 9 pct 
increase in full year profit as it benefited from an acceleration in cost reductions and forecast 'mid to high single-
digit' profit growth for its current year, sending its shares 8 pct higher.
But chief executive Ray Webster, who retires at the end of the month, cautioned that with competition 'brisk', trading 
conditions remain difficult, particularly in the UK.
'We're not assuming the situation's going to get any easier, if anything it may get a little tougher,' he told reporters.
'There's a lot of carriers out there competing for the same customer and we've not seen any sign of the collapse of 
some more of those weaker carriers ... that will happen at some point in time,' he said.
For the year to end-Sept 2006, the Luton-based carrier expects to deliver capacity growth, measured by available 
seats, of 15 pct, down from growth of over 21 pct in the previous year.
Most of this capacity will be deployed in continental Europe, where unlike the UK there is still scope for rapid growth 
in the low fares model.
'Bears may see this (the capacity growth reduction) as a weakness, but it looks to us a sensible path towards 
margin improvement,' noted analysts at ABN Amro, who upgraded their investment recommendation to 'buy' from 
'hold'.
In the current year the airline also anticipates a 3-5 pct reduction in cost per seat excluding fuel and a 'slight 
reduction' in total revenue per seat (fare revenues plus non-seat ancillary revenues) -- a forecast which takes into 
account the impact of a soft consumer backdrop, especially in the UK, on average fares.
Ancillary revenue is forecast to improve with 'double digit percentage growth' supported by a series of new 
initiatives.
For the year to Sept 30 2005 easyJet made a pretax profit of 68 mln stg compared to analysts' consensus forecast 
of 63 mln stg and 62.2 mln stg achieved in the previous year.
The outcome reflected a 23 pct increase in revenue to 1.34 bln stg on passengers up 21.4 pct to 29.6 mln, offset by 
a 47 pct increase in the fuel bill to 260.2 mln stg.
ROUNDUP easyJet cheers with FY pretax up 9 pct and current year guidance
Load factor -- passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available -- increased 0.7 percentage points to 
85.2 pct.
easyJet, which now serves 212 European routes, having added 72 and culled 13 during the year, saw unit revenue 
(total revenue per seat flown) increase 2.1 pct to 38.66 stg
The performance was boosted by a 17 pct increase in ancillary revenue as the airline cracked down on excess 
baggage and encouraged more customers to take out insurance and book cars and hotels with affiliated 
companies. A re-negotiated agreement for in-flight sales also helped.
'There's a number of other initiatives that we're looking at that we haven't yet announced,' said Webster. Rival 
carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC has recently talked-up the potential of in-flight gambling.
Costs continued to be attacked with cost per seat excluding fuel and goodwill amortisation down 7 pct in the second 
half and 4 pct for the year.
'It's an all encompassing programme which covers every item of costs in the profit and loss account,' said Webster.
The further improvements flagged for the current year will come from an increasing number of Airbus A319s in the 
fleet, a new Airbus maintenance deal with SR Technics that will save 10 mln stg, and better airport contracts.
easyJet has so far hedged 50 pct of its fuel requirements for its first half and 25 pct for the second half at 5.90-6.60 
usd per metric tonne compared to the current market price of around 5.50 usd. Webster said the 25 pct figure for 
the second half will increase.
As usual there is no dividend. Earnings per share increased 3 pct to 10.7 pence.
Today's results are the last presented by Webster who is retiring for personal reasons. He will be succeeded by 
Andrew Harrison, the former CEO of RAC PLC, on Dec 1.
The May announcement of Webster's exit accompanied news that easyJet's founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou had 
returned to the board as a non-executive director, less than three years after he quit the company. Haji-Ioannou's 
family own 41 pct of easyJet.
FL Group, the parent company of Icelandair, has built-up a 16.2 pct stake in easyJet over the past year, sparking 
bid speculation. However, FL's chairman, Hannes Smarason, in August played down the prospect of a full-scale bid 
for the British group and in October FL bought Danish low-cost carrier Sterling Airlines for 1.5 bln dkr.
Webster said today that FL has not asked for board representation.
Haji-Iannou has indicated he is an unwilling seller at current levels. But some analysts reckon he may exit at the 
right price given his need to fund other businesses such as his easyCruise, easyMobile and easyHotel ventures.
A stumbling block to any deal would be easyJet's articles of association which limits the level of non-UK share 
ownership in it to 45 pct.
At 12.04 pm shares in easyJet were up 25 pence at 331-1/2, valuing the business at 1.33 bln stg.

right price given his need to fund other businesses such as his easyCruise, easyMobile and easyHotel ventures.
A stumbling block to any deal would be easyJet's articles of association which limits the level of non-UK share 
ownership in it to 45 pct.
At 12.04 pm shares in easyJet were up 25 pence at 331-1/2, valuing the business at 1.33 bln stg.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) - European shares trading in the U.S. got a lift from lower oil prices and lower bond yields 
that kept Wall Street trading higher Friday afternoon.
The Bank of New York Europe American Depositary Receipt Index was up 0.34 points to 129.53 and the overall 
Composite Index added 0.50 points to 129.03.
Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by more than 35 points at one juncture. The S&P 500 Index and 
Nasdaq Composite Index were also in positive territory.
In the technology sector, StMicroelectronics shares were a top gainer, adding as much as 1.5% to $17.54 after 
Merrill Lynch upgraded it to buy. Merrill said substantial margin expansion for the European chipmaker in 2006 and 
2007 will continue to support shares.
Other advances were more subdued. Nokia shares rose 5 cents, at last check, to $17.17. Ericsson shares added 
13 cents to $32.70. Alcatel shares gained 8 cents to $11.81.
Pharmaceutical shares were also a popular draw. Elan Corp. shares, the index's most heavily traded, jumped 4% to 
$9.21 after raised to hold by AG Edwards.
Other winners in the sector included Sanofi-Aventis , whose shares climbed almost 2%, and Serono shares, which 
continued to extend a week-long gain.
In the automobile sector, Daimler Chrysler shares got a boost from lower oil prices, adding 1% to $50.14. The 
German-American carmaker said it would sell its remaining stake in Mitsubishi Motors.
Airline stocks also ticked higher on lower fuel costs. Ireland's no-frills carrier Ryanair Holdings gained 1.9% to 
$49.42. British Airways shares picked up 47 cents to $55.94. Air France shares inched forward 6 cents to $16.95.
The day's moderate gains missed the fixed-line telecom sector. Deutsche Telekom shares dipped a dime to $17.09, 
at last check. Shares of Spain's Telefonica slipped 12 cents to $44.57. France Telecom shares fell 25 cents, just 
under 1%, to $25.33.
Wall Street - European ADRs Europe shares rise as crude, yields fall
In earnings news, Allianz shares dropped 35 cents, or 2.4%, to $14.00 after the company failed to match analyst 
forecasts. Germany's banking and insurance giant said third-quarter net income rose 70% and that revenue 
increased 3%.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC opened lower after the group's strong first half earnings were 
offset by its cautious second half guidance, dealers said.
At 8.08 am, Ryanair was down 0.32 eur -- or 4.5 pct at 6.665 eur.
Ryanair delivered once again, said brokerage Davy. These were very strong results and reaffirms the strength of its 
business model especially when one considers that fuel costs rose by 108 pct and Ryanair was unhedged for 
almost the entire first half of the year, Davy said.
Ryanair's non-fuel costs were down 7 pct as a result of more efficient aircraft, UBS said. Meanwhile, the no-frill 
airline is now 90 pct hedged -- at 49 usd a barrel -- on oil prices which should underpin current year forecasts, UBS 
said.
The group's unchanged guidance for both the third and fourth quarter suggests a less benign yield environment, 
Davy said. Ryanair has forecast flat yields in the third quarter and down 5-to-10 pct in the fourth quarter.
Earlier Ryanair reported first half profits of 238 mln eur, an 18 pct increase on last year's 201.2 mln eur.
This was achieved on a 33 pct rise in revenue to 946.2 mln eur, reflecting a 29 pct increase in passengers carried 
to 18.0 mln.
Yields or average fares increased by 3 pct, while unit costs increased 8 pct as fuel costs rose 108 pct to 236.9 mln 
eur. Excluding fuel unit costs fell 7 pct.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, has reported record half year profits but is 
still 'cautious' on the outlook for the balance of its financial year.
For the six months to Sept 30 the Dublin-based carrier made profit after tax of 237 mln eur, an 18 pct increase on 
last year's 201.2 mln eur.
This was achieved on a 33 pct rise in revenue to 946.2 mln eur, reflecting a 29 pct increase in passengers carried 
to 18.0 mln.
Yields or average fares increased by 3 pct, while unit costs increased 8 pct as fuel costs rose 108 pct to 236.9 mln 
eur. Excluding fuel unit costs fell 7 pct.
Ryanair's adjusted after tax margin for the half year fell 3 points to 25 pct.
'We continue to remain cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year,' said Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary.
'We anticipate that the fare differentials between Ryanair and the flag carriers will be partially eroded as the fuel 
surchargers are forced to lower their underlying fares to compete with Ryanair's lower prices.'
The airline expects 'significant' increases in passenger volumes and anticipates that third quarter yields will be 
'broadly in line' with last year and fourth quarter yields will fall by 5-10 pct, as previously guided. Its net profit 
guidance is unchanged.
'This winter we expect that there will be continued intense competition and there will be fewer low fare carriers in 
the market as higher fuel prices force more carriers out of the industry,' added O'Leary.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, is expected to report a record quarterly 
profit when it publishes second quarter results today.
For the three months to Sept 30 Goodbody Stockbrokers is forecasting a 17 pct increase in net profit to 173 mln 
eur, using assumptions of a 1.8 pct rise in average fares, a 35 pct bounce in ancillary revenue and tight control over 
non-fuel costs.
Exane BNP Paribas is forecasting second quarter net profit of 180 mln eur, up 22 pct, and first half net profit of 249 
mln eur, up 24 pct.
Investors will focus on the outlook for the winter season given continuing high fuel costs and faltering consumer 
confidence around Europe.
Ryanair last updated the market on Oct 4 when it described current trading as 'in line with expectations'.
It said higher fuel prices over the summer months had been partly offset by other cost reductions and a slightly 
more benign yield (fares) environment
The airline reiterated its 'cautious' guidance for the winter season. It said yields were expected to benefit from the 
fuel surcharges imposed by other airlines but anticipated the fare differential between Ryanair and the flag carriers 
would be 'partially eroded' as the flag carriers lowered fares to compete.
Ryanair said it remained 'comfortable' with its previous guidance for the balance of the year to end-March 2006 -- 
strong load factors (passengers as a proportion of available seats) and passenger volumes but at 'slightly' lower 
yields.
On Nov 2 the airline launched a 2 mln 'free' seat sale. It said this will hit yields in the fourth quarter, compensated 
for by higher margins in the first half.

LONDON (AFX) - Europe's largest bourses made a lacklustre start to the day as investors stopped to catch their 
breath after solid gains last week, and as they digested a mixed set of earnings news, dealers said.
At 08.20, the STOXX 50 was up 0.43 points at 3258.11 and the STOXX 600 was up 0.19 points at 295.7.
In New York last Friday, the DJIA added 8.17 points to 10,530.76 while the Nasdaq finished 9.21 higher at 
2,169.43.
And in Asia overnight, the Nikkei closed down 14.36 points at 14,061.60 while the Hang Seng closed for lunch 
down 215.99 at 14,369.80.
Still in Asia, oil prices dipped 44 cents to 60.14 usd as mild weather in the northern hemisphere calmed concerns 
over demand for heating oil as the winter approaches.
Veolia added 1 pct after a solid set of earnings for the first nine months of the year and as it upped its full year 
forecasts.
But Munich Re slipped 0.76 pct after its third quarter numbers failed to excite and Ryanair tumbled more than 4 pct 
on its cautious outlook.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares are set to open the session flat as the market pauses for breath after 200 point 
plus gains last week with continued bid fever in the weekend press offset by caution ahead of the Bank of England's 
rate decision on Thursday, dealers said.
According to spread bettor firm CMC, the FTSE 100 is seen opening 1 point higher at around 5425, after closing on 
Friday at 5423.6 having notched up its biggest weekly gain in 2-1/2 years.
Meanwhile in New York, stocks ended higher, with the DJIA adding 8.17 points to 10,530.76 while the Nasdaq 
finished 9.21 to the good at 2,169.43.
And in Asia overnight, the Nikkei started its afternoon session 74.69 points lower at 14,001.27 while the Hang Seng 
closed for lunch down 215.99 at 14,369.80.
Still in Asia, oil prices dipped 44 cents to 60.14 usd as mild weather in the northern hemisphere calmed concerns 
over demand for heating oil as the winter approaches.
Back in London, in economics, the main focus this week will be the BoE's rate decision with most pundits expecting 
the cost of borrowing to remain unchanged at 4.50 pct as worries over above-target inflation offset concerns over 
the level of economic growth.
But today investors will monitor UK industrial production data with the market flagging a modest 0.7 pct rise in Sept 
from the previous month -- an improvement from the 0.9 pct decline in August.
Manufacturing output, meanwhile, is seen rising 0.5 pct month-on-month for a year-on-year fall of 0.2 pct compared 
with falls of 0.2 pct and 0.1 pct respectively in August.
On a quiet day for corporate news, Ryanair, Europe's largest no-frills airline, this morning posted a rise in first half 
profit after tax of 237.0 mln eur, up from 201.2 mln previously with yields 3 pct higher.
Looking to the future, the group said it remains 'cautious' on the outlook for the balance of the financial year and 
expects third quarter yields 'broadly in line' with last year, with the last quarter falling 5-10 pct.
Nevertheless it kept its guidance for full year net profit unchanged.

Other companies penciled in for interim numbers include DCC, Immunodiagnostic Systems, with third quarter 
figures from Utek Corp, final results from United Clearing and a trading update from NETeller.
As always, investors will turn to the weekend press for direction with all the papers feeding on the recent bid frenzy 
in UK PLC.
According to the Sunday Telegraph, E.ON, the Germany utility group has begun takeover talks with Scottish Power 
on a possible 11-12 bln stg bid.
The paper believes an announcement could be made as early as this week with both E.ON and Scottish Power due 
to report results on Thursday.
Meanwhile, The Sunday Times claims Scottish & Southern Energy has appointed advisers to evaluate a merger 
with Scottish Power that would establish a 19 bln stg utility giant.
Still in M&A, Saint-Gobain, the French building materials group, is expected to receive the green light from the EU 
competition commission this week to pursue its 3.6 bln stg hostile takeover of UK plasterboard-maker BPB, 
according to The Business.
The decision is expected to result in an increase in Saint-Gobain's initial 720 pence per share offer which was 
rejected by BPB's board -- but the figure is still likely to fall short of the 4.1 bln stg price tag BPB demanded last 
week.
According to Saturday's Times, the 7 bln stg merger between Boots and Alliance Unichem could face a headache 
as Boots' second largest shareholder Silchester International may vote against against the deal.
On the second line, the future of the London Stock Exchange accounted for a batch of column inches, with the 
Observer claiming Macquarie Bank, the Australian financial services giant, is a step closer to launching a bid with 
the appointment of Goldman Sachs as its financial adviser.
The paper speculates a bid, possibly hostile, could come as early as this week, but also says The New York Stock 
Exchange is also considering a move for the LSE.
The Independent on Sunday reported Euronext's interest in the LSE has cooled and instead could focus on a deal 
with Deutsche Boerse, leaving Macquarie as the only potential LSE bidder.
On the flip side, The Mail on Sunday claimed the LSE could go on the acquisition trail itself as it eyes possible 
moves for its counterparts in Milan and Madrid and might even consider a tilt at the New York Stock Exchange.
And bid fever continues to engulf P&O with The Business reporting the world's biggest ports operator, Hong Kong's 
Hutchison Port Holdings, has placed investment bank JP Morgan on standby to act on a potential move.
This follows news last week that P&O received an indicative approach from Dubai Ports World of around 3.8 bln 
stg, with talk Temasek, the Singapore governments investment arm, is also ready to pounce.
Still in midacps, Pilkington will meet its suitor Nippon Sheet Glass within the next few days for talks that are 
expected to lead to an agreed bid in excess of 2 bln stg, according to the Sunday Telegraph.
The UK glass manufacturer last week rejected a prospective offer of 150 pence per share from the Japanese 
company which valued Pilkington at 1.98 bln stg.
According to The Business, Hellman & Friedman, the US private-equity giant, is the frontrunner to win the 1.4 bln 
stg battle to take over Collins Stewart Tullett.
Meanwhile, buyout group Apax Partners is looking to join a consortium lining up a 7 bln stg-plus bid for merged 
NTL/Telewest Group, according to the Sunday Express.
London shares outlook -- flat as market pauses for breath ahead of rate decision
And the Sunday Times named Carillion as the mystery bidder behind last week's approach for Mowlem, the 260 
mln stg quoted construction and support-services firm.
Away from M&A, Tesco faces the prospect of being forced to sell off some of its shops in what would be an 
explosive intervention aimed at curbing the retail giant's high street dominance, according to the Observer.
While in media, ITV will garner attention after The Mail on Sunday said the broadcaster lost audience share every 
month for the past 19 months.
At the same time, the number of viewers who watch its adverts has slumped by more than 8 pct.
And ITV will be further in the spotlight as several newspapers claim it will bid for website Friends Reunited.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares are set to open the session flat as the market pauses for breath after 200 point 
plus gains last week with continued bid fever in the weekend press offset by caution ahead of the Bank of England's 
rate decision on Thursday, dealers said.
According to spread bettor firm CMC, the FTSE 100 is seen opening 1 point higher at around 5425, after closing on 
Friday at 5423.6 having notched up its biggest weekly gain in 2-1/2 years.
Meanwhile in New York, stocks ended higher, with the DJIA adding 8.17 points to 10,530.76 while the Nasdaq 
finished 9.21 to the good at 2,169.43.
And in Asia overnight, the Nikkei started its afternoon session 74.69 points lower at 14,001.27 while the Hang Seng 
closed for lunch down 215.99 at 14,369.80.
Still in Asia, oil prices dipped 44 cents to 60.14 usd as mild weather in the northern hemisphere calmed concerns 
over demand for heating oil as the winter approaches.
Back in London, in economics, the main focus this week will be the BoE's rate decision with most pundits expecting 
the cost of borrowing to remain unchanged at 4.50 pct as worries over above-target inflation offset concerns over 
the level of economic growth.
But today investors will monitor UK industrial production data with the market flagging a modest 0.7 pct rise in Sept 
from the previous month -- an improvement from the 0.9 pct decline in August.
Manufacturing output, meanwhile, is seen rising 0.5 pct month-on-month for a year-on-year fall of 0.2 pct compared 
with falls of 0.2 pct and 0.1 pct respectively in August.
On a quiet day for corporate news, Ryanair, Europe's largest no-frills airline, this morning posted a rise in first half 
profit after tax of 237.0 mln eur, up from 201.2 mln previously with yields 3 pct higher.
Looking to the future, the group said it remains 'cautious' on the outlook for the balance of the financial year and 
expects third quarter yields 'broadly in line' with last year, with the last quarter falling 5-10 pct.
Nevertheless it kept its guidance for full year net profit unchanged.

LONDON (AFX) - Europe's largest bourses are set to open flat as investors catch their breath after solid gains last 
week, with all eyes on the latest wave of corporate and economic data this week, dealers said.
In New York last Friday, the DJIA added 8.17 points to 10,530.76 while the Nasdaq finished 9.21 higher at 
2,169.43.
And in Asia overnight, the Nikkei started its afternoon session 74.69 points lower at 14,001.27 while the Hang Seng 
closed for lunch down 215.99 at 14,369.80.
Still in Asia, oil prices dipped 44 cents to 60.14 usd as mild weather in the northern hemisphere calmed concerns 
over demand for heating oil as the winter approaches.
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, has reported record half year profits but is still 'cautious' on 
the outlook for the balance of its financial year.
Lafarge North America, owned 54 pct by Lafarge SA, said third quarter net profit rose to 172.1 mln usd from 165.6 
mln in the same period last year, on the back of price increases for all products and strength in gypsum sales.
Numbers are also due today from Munich Re which is expected to unveil third quarter results that will be strongly 
affected by its exposure to the hurricanes that recently hit the US coast, but with bottom-line profit boosted by the 
sale of a stake in Allianz, analysts said.
Analysts polled by AFX News expect the third quarter combined ratio to worsen significantly from the same period 
last year, to 122-128 pct from 105.8 pct.
Deutsche Boerse is expected to report strong third-quarter results this evening boosted by solid growth at its Xetra 
and Eurex segments, and is likely to hike its full-year EBITA guidance as a result, analysts said.
Veolia will post a nine month operating profit of 1.374-1.375 bln eur on an IFRS basis today, with the only 
comparison being the year earlier GAAP figure of 1.114 bln, analysts said.
Sales are expected to be in the range of 17.816-17.959 bln eur, against 20.370 bln.
Royal KPN is expected to present later today lower third quarter net profit, EBITDA and sales as operating margins 
decline, analysts polled by AFX News said.
Euroshares outlook - Treading water ahead of earnings and economic news
Net profit is expected to come in at 296-362 mln eur from 364 mln eur the year before, while sales are seen at 2.94-
3.00 bln eur, from 2.95 bln. EBITDA is expected to have declined to 1.13-1.17 bln eur from 1.20 bln.
The steel sector may be weighed down after a report in the Financial Times said China plans to increase its own 
output to reduce its dependence on imports.
New and ongoing M&A talk dominated the weekend papers again this weekend.
Bayer AG chief executive Werner Wenning said he did not rule out a tie-up with Altana's pharma unit.
In an interview in Der Spiegel, he said Bayer examines all offers when asked about the company's interest in 
acquiring Altana AG's pharma business.
Earlier this month, Altana chief executive Nikolaus Schweickart said the company wanted to find a strategic partner 
for its pharma business but that it was 'not ruling anything out.'
Novartis has also reportedly shown an interest although no agreement on price has been reached.
The worlds biggest ports operator, Hutchison Port Holdings of Hong Kong, has placed the investment bank JP 
Morgan on standby to act on a potential bid for Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Co, the Sunday Times 
reported, citing a source close to DPW.
The move swells the prospects of a full-blown auction of one of Britains most venerable corporate names after the 
appointment of UBS to advise Temasek, the Singapore governments investment arm, on a 3 bln stg offer.
Temasek owns the Port of Singapore Authority, the worlds second-biggest port operator.
The wave of interest in P&O follows news last week that Dubai Ports World, the state-owned ports operator, had 
appointed Deutsche Bank to approach the board of P&O about a takeover.
The power group Scottish & Southern Energy PLC has appointed advisers to evaluate a merger with its neighbour 
Scottish Power PLC that would establish a 19 bln stg utility giant, the Sunday Times reported, citing banking 
sources close to SSE.
Scottish Power, which has a market value of just under 10.5 bln stg, last week began formal talks to be acquired by 
the German energy company E.ON AG, which owns Powergen.
Tesco PLC faces the prospect of being forced to sell off some of its shops in what would be an explosive 
intervention aimed at curbing the retail giant's high street dominance, The Observer reported.
MPs, retailers and think-tanks are calling for the measure to be considered by regulators, who have indicated they 
will look seriously at the proposal, the newspaper said.
Pilkington PLC, the 178-year-old British glass maker, will meet its smaller Japanese suitor within the next few days 
for talks that are expected to lead to an agreed bid in excess of 2 bln stg for the company, the Sunday Telegraph 
reported without citing sources.
Carillion PLC, the firm that manages London's Royal Parks, is the mystery bidder behind last week's approach to 
Mowlem PLC, the 260 mln stg quoted construction and support-services firm, the Sunday Times reported without 
citing sources.
And Eircom PLC's will meet this week to decide whether to enter into exclusive takeover talks with Swisscom AG 
and to allow the Swiss company to conduct due diligence on its books, according to Sonntags Zeitung.
The New York Stock Exchange is considering a bid for London Stock Exchange PLC, according to UK paper, the 
Observer.
Euroshares outlook - Treading water ahead of earnings and economic news
Groupe Bollore, controlled by French financier Vincent Bollore, said on Saturday it had raised its stake in Aegis 
Group PLC to 24.97 pct, just short of the 25 pct threshold that would give Bollore a blocking minority in the 
company.
The move comes shortly after Bollore announced that its Financiere du Loch holding company, the same that has 
been buying the Aegis shares, has sold down its stake in French payment terminals maker Ingenico to 5.5 pct.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, is expected to report a record quarterly 
profit when it publishes second quarter results on Monday.
For the three months to Sept 30 Goodbody Stockbrokers is forecasting a 17 pct increase in net profit to 173 mln 
eur, using assumptions of a 1.8 pct rise in average fares, a 35 pct bounce in ancillary revenue and tight control over 
non-fuel costs.
Exane BNP Paribas is forecasting second quarter net profit of 180 mln eur, up 22 pct, and first half net profit of 249 
mln eur, up 24 pct.
Investors will focus on the outlook for the winter season given continuing high fuel costs and faltering consumer 
confidence around Europe.
Ryanair last updated the market on Oct 4 when it described current trading as 'in line with expectations'.
It said higher fuel prices over the summer months had been partly offset by other cost reductions and a slightly 
more benign yield (fares) environment
The airline reiterated its 'cautious' guidance for the winter season. It said yields were expected to benefit from the 
fuel surcharges imposed by other airlines but anticipated the fare differential between Ryanair and the flag carriers 
would be 'partially eroded' as the flag carriers lowered fares to compete.
Ryanair said it remained 'comfortable' with its previous guidance for the balance of the year to end-March 2006 -- 
strong load factors (passengers as a proportion of available seats) and passenger volumes but at 'slightly' lower 
yields.
On Nov 2 the airline launched a 2 mln 'free' seat sale. It said this will hit yields in the fourth quarter, compensated 
for by higher margins in the first half.

'Our competitors oppose us in the German market, and, for this reason it will be a pleasure to challenge them in 
Great Britain,' Hunold said.
Air Berlin already operates numerous flights to the island nation, but it will now use Stansted as a hub allowing 
passengers to take connecting flights to Glasgow and Manchester.
Hunold said Air Berlin may introduce further domestic routes in the future, without specifying further.
The chief executive did not state exactly when the new flights will start.
Air Berlin is expanding rapidly to meet rising demand. It expects to carry 13.8 mln passengers this year, up from 12 
mln in 2004.

FRANKFURT (AFX) - Shares are seen opening flat to slightly lower following yesterday's sharp gains as investors 
take a breather after this week's flurry of German earnings reports, with a rise in oil prices and caution ahead of US 
jobs data possibly offsetting gains on Wall Street overnight, dealers said.
At 8.37 am, brokerage Lang & Schwarz indicated the DAX 30 index would open
at about 5,007, down some 4 points compared with yesterday's close at 5,011.00.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, is planning to trial in-flight gambling by 
spring 2007, chief executive Michael O'Leary told a news briefing.
He said the experiment, which will also include in-flight arcade games, will come around 12 months after the carrier 
trials on-board mobile phone use next spring.
Last April Ryanair abandoned its first experiment in paid-for in-flight entertainment involving Hollywood films and 
kids cartoons after passengers showed reluctance to pay for what had once been a free service.
O'Leary said the decision to trial in-flight gambling using portable consoles follows the phenomenal success of its 
scratch card offer.
He dismissed the suggestion that the roll-out of gambling might discourage families from flying Ryanair.
'We recognise your right to object, but good luck, somebody else will have your seat,' he said.
O'Leary was speaking after the airline launched a 2 mln 'free' seat sale.
At 12.13 pm shares in Ryanair were down 0.06 eur at 7.12.

STOCKHOLM (AF) - A Ryanair flight carrying 111 people from Tampere in Finland to Britain's Stansted airport was 
forced to make an emergency landing in Sweden due to engine trouble, the Swedish Civil Aviation Authority said.
'We received the alarm at 10:33 pm yesterday, that the plane would make an emergency landing with only one 
motor,' Katarina Ahlberg of the agency said.
It was unclear whether the second motor had failed or had been switched off for some other reason, she said.
The plane, a Boeing 737, landed at the Sturup airport in the southern Swedish town of Malmo at 10:58 pm without 
incident, according to Ahlberg.
'It is more difficult to land with only one engine because the plane does not have the same force to break or speed 
up again if needed... Luckily, no one was injured,' she said.

BRUSSELS (AFX) - The minister for consumer protection, Freya Van den Bossche, has decided to bring legal 
action against Ryanair and Virgin Express on the basis of a lack of transparency regarding pricing policy, according 
to Belga news agency.
The alleged practices relate to airport taxes and additional fees the companies charge customers paying by credit 
card while failing to propose other means of payment, Belga cited Van den Bossche as saying.
'The consumer must know in advance what it will have to pay. In the case of an offer for a plane ticket, the price 
indicated must be the total price, including all charges and taxes,' she said.
Ryanair and Virgin Express said they believe they show sufficient transparency in their tariff policy, added the 
Belgian news service.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in easyJet PLC edged up in early deals as the budget airline said passenger numbers 
rose 16.5 pct to 2.7 million in September, while the load factor slipped to 86.4 pct.
Easyjet also reiterated its guidance from August, indicating it expects pretax profit for the year to end Sept to be 
broadly in line with last year.
UBS is leaving its 'neutral' recommendation unchanged and keeps a 300 pence price target. It is currently 
forecasting a pretax profit of 75 mln stg, and said the consensus forecast is 78 mln stg.
'Following these numbers, Easyjet is now moving into the most uncertain period of the year as the strong summer 
months drop off into the winter,' it said in a note to investors.
UBS said Ryanair has indicated that yields in this period could be flat, which it thinks is realistic for Easyjet as well.
Merrill Lynch also reiterated its 'neutral' stance.
At 8.39 am, the shares were trading at 304-1/2, up 2-1/2.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares are expected to open lower Wednesday following sharp falls on Wall Street last 
night where investors took flight as the spectre of inflation raised the prospect of further rate hikes, dealers said.
Spreadbetters Finspreads are calling for the FTSE 100 to open around 30 points lower at about 5,464 having 
closed out at 5,494.4 on Tuesday.
Last night on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 94.37 points to 10,441.11 as Federal Reserve 
concern over inflation in the economy and profit warnings from Lexmark International and Clorox erased the 
positive impact of a fall in crude oil prices.
The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 16.07 points at 2,139.36, while the S&P 500 Index dropped 12.23 points 
to 1,214.47.
Stock market sentiment took a further knock as key Fed officials underlined the central bank's concern over inflation 
in the economy.
In the first of three speeches from Fed officials, Dallas Fed President Robert Fisher said the central bank must 
continue to raise interest rates as inflation is close to the top of its tolerance zone.
In Asia, share prices ended the morning session lower, as investors locked-in profits after a sharp rise yesterday.
At the break, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average was down 22.41 points at 13,716.43. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng 
index closed the morning down 172.27 points at 15,209.94 as the falls on Wall Street weighed on investor 
sentiment.
Looking to events in London today, John David Group reports interim figures and participants will be eager to see 
whether the sports retailer has been able to meet expectations in the light of a slowdown in consumer spending.
JD Sports said like-for-like sales for the 6 months to July 16 were up 0.2 pct in Sport Fascias while like for like sales 
in Fashion Fascias dropped 3.4 pct. Overall like for like sales for the period eased 0.1 pct.
Elsewhere, Chesnara, the closed life fund operator, is expected to turn in stronger interim results today, as the 
impact of hefty endowment mis-selling claims last year fades.

House broker Numis Securities looks for achieved operating profits before tax of 2.6 mln stg, up from a loss of 13.5 
mln stg in the same period last year.
The anticipated improvement reflects a view that Chesnara will set aside less cash to cover possible endowment 
mis-selling claims than it did in the same period last year, when it made provisions totalling 22.6 mln stg.
Finally British Airways and Ryanair are set to release traffic data for September.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares are expected to open lower Wednesday following sharp falls on Wall Street last 
night where investors took flight as the spectre of inflation raised the prospect of further rate hikes, dealers said.
Spreadbetters Finspreads are calling for the FTSE 100 to open around 30 points lower at about 5,464 having 
closed out at 5,494.4 on Tuesday.
Last night on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 94.37 points to 10,441.11 as Federal Reserve 
concern over inflation in the economy and profit warnings from Lexmark International and Clorox erased the 
positive impact of a fall in crude oil prices.
The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 16.07 points at 2,139.36, while the S&P 500 Index dropped 12.23 points 
to 1,214.47.
Stock market sentiment took a further knock as key Fed officials underlined the central bank's concern over inflation 
in the economy.
In the first of three speeches from Fed officials, Dallas Fed President Robert Fisher said the central bank must 
continue to raise interest rates as inflation is close to the top of its tolerance zone.
In Asia, share prices ended the morning session lower, as investors locked-in profits after a sharp rise yesterday.
At the break, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average was down 22.41 points at 13,716.43. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng 
index closed the morning down 172.27 points at 15,209.94 as the falls on Wall Street weighed on investor 
sentiment.
Looking to events in London today, John David Group reports interim figures and participants will be eager to see 
whether the sports retailer has been able to meet expectations in the light of a slowdown in consumer spending.
JD Sports said like-for-like sales for the 6 months to July 16 were up 0.2 pct in Sport Fascias while like for like sales 
in Fashion Fascias dropped 3.4 pct. Overall like for like sales for the period eased 0.1 pct.
Elsewhere, Chesnara, the closed life fund operator, is expected to turn in stronger interim results today, as the 
impact of hefty endowment mis-selling claims last year fades.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based no-frills airline, said current trading continues to be 'in 
line with expectations' as it reported a 27 pct rise in September passengers.
'Higher fuel prices over the summer months have been partly offset by a combination of other cost reductions and 
slightly more benign yield (fares) environment,' said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
Looking to the winter season, the airline remains 'cautious'.
It expects yields to benefit from fuel surcharges imposed by other airlines but anticipates the fare differential 
between Ryanair and the flag carriers will be 'partially eroded' as the flag carriers lower fares to compete.
Nevertheless, Ryanair remains 'comfortable' with its previous guidance for the balance of the year to end-March 
2006 -- strong load factors (passengers as a proportion of available seats) and passenger volumes but at 'slightly' 
lower yields.
During September Ryanair carried 3.0 mln passengers, up from 2.4 mln in the same month last year, giving a rolling 
12-month total of 31.6 mln.
Load factor was 87 pct, the same as in September 2004, giving a rolling 12-month load factor of 84 pct.
At 9.30 am shares in Ryanair were up 0.05 eur at 6.82 eur.

NEW YORK (AFX) -- Boeing Co., which cut a deal with its machinists union late last week ending nearly a month-
long strike, delivered 62 commercial planes during the third quarter, the aerospace and defense giant said Tuesday.
Shares of Boeing , a Dow Jones Industrial Average component, gained $1.12, or 1.7%, to $68.26 in recent trading. 
Boeing's stock closed the quarter near its highest levels of the year after its machinists union began returning to 
work.
The Chicago-based company said it delivered 47 of its next generation of 737s in the latest quarter, bring total 
deliveries so far this year to 160. Total aircraft deliveries in 2005 came to 217.
Boeing also said it delivered 11 F/A-18E and 18F fighter jets in the quarter, and 32 so far this year.
Paul Nisbet, aerospace and defense analyst with JSA Research, said that Boeing's third-quarter earnings could 
take a hit of 15 cents to 20 cents a share by not delivering for approximately 25 aircraft as a result of the strike. 
Those deliveries should be made in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2006.
Ryanair schedules deliveries
Also Tuesday, Ryanair said it exercised options to buy nine Boeing 737-800's with a value of more than $500 
million for delivery late in 2007.
In addition, Ryanair plans to sell the first five of its older Boeing 737-800s, also late in 2007, the Irish low-cost 
carrier said.
However, Willie Walsh, the new chief executive of British Airways PLC , on Tuesday said the U.K. flag carrier won't 
take any plane deliveries until its move to the new Terminal Five at London Heathrow's airport in 2008.

LONDON (AFX) - The UK government said it is to make it easier for foreign airlines to fly new international air 
services to or from UK regional airports.
The government said it will in future apply a general presumption in favour of allowing foreign airlines to set down or 
pick up passengers, or cargo, at a UK regional airport en route to another country.
It will also allow a foreign airline flying to the UK to pick up passengers or cargo from a third country en route to its 
destination in the UK.
The government said that rights to operate such services, known as 'fifth freedom' rights, have traditionally been 
closely limited through the system of bilateral air services agreements under which international aviation is 
controlled.
UK aviation Minister Karen Buck said: 'Today's announcement supports the UK's policy... to promote the growth of 
regional airports.
'The move will potentially mean more services and a greater choice of
connections for passengers outside the South East of England.'
'It is now up to the airlines to apply to operate new services,' she added.

STOCKWATCH European airlines eyed as Deutsche resumes coverage with 'positive'
STOCKWATCH European airlines eyed as Deutsche resumes coverage with 
'positive'

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in European Airlines were in focus in midday trade as Deutsche Bank resumed coverage 
of the sector with a positive view, highlighting easyJet PLC, Deutsche Lufthansa SA and British Airways PLC as its 
top picks, said dealers.
In Deutsche's view, 2006 sector fundamentals look good, with signs of accelerated consolidation and capacity 
discipline, improving investment attractiveness, corporate strategy is generally focused around cost control and 
margin development.
Moreover, Deutsche estimated that for the flag carriers, underlying demand in 2006 will exceed supply by an 
average of 150 basis points. The broker added that in the last post-Gulf War period, one of comparable capacity 
constraint and fare inflation, equity valuations of airlines such as BA doubled.
While Deutsche admitted that fuel costs are a risk, the broker pointed out that hedging and cost discipline are 
mitigating the problem. In addition, Deutsche thinks that 'fuel surcharges', which are sticking, are basically price 
rises in disguise.
Looking at the individual stocks, Deutsche said its key picks are easyJet, Lufthansa and BA.
In Deutsche's opinion, easyJet is set to benefit from the focus on margin enhancement. Hence, the broker's 'buy' 
rating and 332 pence target price on the low cost carrier.
As for Lufthansa, Deutsche argued that enhancing core business profitability and managing liabilities should prove 
valuation upside for the stock. Lufthansa is rated 'buy', with a 12.5 eur target.
Meanwhile, Deutsche highlighted that BA is trading at a discount to the sector and is a defensive, cash-generative 
play. BA is also rated 'buy' and has target of 327 pence.
On a more downbeat note, Deutsche advised selling Air France-KLM SA as it feels its high liability levels need to be 
managed more aggressively. The broker added that it sees absolute downside in Ryanair Holdings PLC on 
valuation, Iberia SA on yield concerns and Austrian Airlines on fuel worries, respectively.

At 12.01 pm, shares in the airlines were weaker as oil prices remained above 67 usd a barrel. BA shares were 
down 3-3/4 at 285 pence, easyJet was off 1-1/2 pence at 287-1/2, Ryanair dipped 0.12 eur to 6.59, Air France was 
down 0.18 eur at 13.6 and Iberia was 0.04 eur lower at 2.06.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based no-frills airline, has been forced to modify its flight 
schedule this month and next because a strike at Boeing Company has delayed the delivery of some aircraft.
Seven planes were scheduled to be received in September and October but are now not expected to be delivered 
until November and December.
With Boeing having experienced work stoppages since early this month, Ryanair is conservatively assuming these 
disruptions will continue until at least the end of next month.
Ryanair said approximately 200 flights, less than 1 pct of its total, have been 'amalgamated' during October. It 
reckons the financial impact will be immaterial.
Three of the carrier's 737-200 series aircraft which were due to be retired this month will now continue in service 
until the end of October.
Ryanair said new base launches in Liverpool and Pisa, scheduled to start on Sept 27 and Oct 10 respectively, will 
proceed with the airline using a new 737-800 which was delivered by Boeing earlier this month and also utilising 
one of the three spare 800's for October.
At 3.07 pm shares in Ryanair were down 0.03 eur at 6.78 eur.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based no-frills airline, has been forced to modify its flight 
schedule this month and next because a strike at Boeing Company has delayed the delivery of some aircraft.
Seven planes were scheduled to be received in September and October but are now not expected to be delivered 
until November and December.
With Boeing having experienced work stoppages since early this month, Ryanair is conservatively assuming these 
disruptions will continue until at least the end of next month.
Ryanair said approximately 200 flights, less than 1 pct of its total, have been 'amalgamated' during October. It 
reckons the financial impact will be immaterial.
Three of the carrier's 737-200 series aircraft which were due to be retired this month will now continue in service 
until the end of October.
Ryanair said new base launches in Liverpool and Pisa, scheduled to start on Sept 27 and Oct 10 respectively, will 
proceed with the airline using a new 737-800 which was delivered by Boeing earlier this month and also utilising 
one of the three spare 800's for October.
At 3.07 pm shares in Ryanair were down 0.03 eur at 6.78 eur.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based no-frills airline, has again insisted it has no intention of 
introducing fuel surcharges.
'Ryanair will never apply a fuel surcharge, not now, not ever,' chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
He accused British Airways PLC, which earlier this month raised its fuel surcharge on longhaul flights to 60 stg per 
return trip, of 'profiteering at passengers' expense'.
'BA has recently increased its fuel surcharge for a fifth time... despite the fact that back in August it confirmed to its 
shareholders that it had hedged 75 pct of its fuel requirements for the rest of this year at 43 usd a barrel. If BA is not 
paying the current higher oil prices, why is it still increasing fuel surcharges to passengers?,' he asked.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC rose in early morning trade after Davy Stockbrokers raised its 
price target to 9.25 eur from 8.00 and argued the shares deserved a re-rating, said dealers.
In a report to clients, Davy noted that recent results from Ryanair compare very favourable with market leaders. 
The focus now shifts towards the second-quarter results in November, said Davy, which thinks this quarter should 
be no different from the first.
Currently, Davy assumes operating profit growth of 9 pct and earnings growth of 8 pct, although it added these 
estimates could prove light if Ryanair continues as in the first quarter.
As for the high price of oil, Davy pointed out that with Ryanair's high margin and a double-digit earnings business 
model it can adapt to a better pricing environment or find cost savings elsewhere.
At 9.24 am, shares in Ryanair were up 0.07 eur at 6.79.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has postponed plans to launch a base at Hamburg Luebeck airport, 
which would have delivered up to 2 mln passengers per annum and created 2,000 jobs, because the Higher 
Administrative Court of Schleswig-Holstein ruled against planning approval to extend the runway, expand the main 
taxiway and upgrade the instrument landing system.
Ryanair said it will maintain its existing operation at the airport.
It also said it will continue to support its partners - the City of Luebeck and Infratil - in their efforts to resolve this 
planning problem so that they can continue to develop the airport, grow their passenger numbers, and the group 
can proceed with the launch of a Ryanair base in Hamburg Luebeck as soon as it is practical in the future.
Ryanair said it will announce another base in Europe later this week, where it will invest over 100 mln usd in new 
aircraft, new routes and new jobs.

EU adopts new guidelines regulating aid to airlines at regional airports

BRUSSELS (AFX) - The European Commission said it has adopted legally binding guidelines regulating state aid 
given by governments to airlines operating new routes from regional airports.
Under the new plans, governments would be able to grant state aid to cover 30-50 pct of the start-up costs accrued 
by airlines at regional airports over a maximum of five years.
The guidelines are for airports with fewer than 5 mln passengers a year.
The public funding of airport infrastructure is also covered by the rules. National governments are free to finance 
new air transport infrastructure, but the commission will monitor the situation to ensure competition is effective.
'The new guidelines will increase transparency and prevent any discrimination in the agreements concluded by 
regional airports and airlines on start-up aid,' the EU executive said.
The commission added that the rules will 'guarantee' equal treatment for public and private airports and ensure that 
airlines receiving aid are not unduly favoured.
The decision comes after the commission earlier this year was involved in an aid dispute with low-cost carrier 
Ryanair.
Last February, the airline was ordered by the commission to repay approximately 4 mln eur of a total 15 mln in state 
aid given to operate at Charleroi airport in Belgium.

LOS ANGELES (AFX) -- Among the companies whose shares are expected to see active trade in Tuesday's 
session is Miami-based Carnival Corp., after the company said it sees a 1 cent to 3 cent a share hit on earnings as 
a result of Hurricane Katrina.
Carnival Corp. -- the world's largest cruise operator -- said Monday that it had to cancel one cruise and shorten the 
voyages of two others due to hurricanes.
Carnival Cruise Lines, a unit of Carnival Corp., said that it has chartered its cruise ships Ecstasy, Sensation and 
Holiday to the Military Sealift Command on behalf of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The ships will 
be used to provide emergency housing to about 7,000 evacuees. The charter is expected to last about six months.
Other shares expected to see active trading Tuesday are UBS, British Airways PLC, Ryanair Holdings PLC, 
GlaxoSmithKline PLC.
Casey's General Stores Inc. is expected to report first-quarter earnings of 34 cents a share, according to analysts 
polled by Thomson First Call.
Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. is seen posting a second-quarter net profit of 33 cents a share.
McData Corp.'s second quarter is expected a show a profit of a penny a share.
Neiman Marcus Group is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings of 52 cents, according to two analysts.
Shuffle Master Inc. is posting a third-quarter profit of 21 cents a share.
Watch list
On Monday, UBS said it will sell the Ehinger & Armand von Ernst, Ferrier Lullin & Cie. SA and Banco di Lugano 
private banks, and its GAM asset management unit, to Julius Baer for SFr5.6 billion ($4.55 billion), equivalent to 
SFr3.8 billion in cash plus a 21.5% stake in Baer. UBS expects to record a pre-tax gain of at least SFr3.5 billion 
from the transaction, and Julis Baer sees expected to close in the fourth quarter. Julius Baer sees synergies of 
more than SFr150 million pre-tax per year by 2008. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
British Airways reported passenger traffic was down 0.7% in August, hurt by the strike that came after catering firm 
Gate Gourmet fired several workers. Premium traffic fell 4.7% during the month. Cargo traffic meanwhile fell 10.2%.
Carnival Corp. , UBS , Neiman Marcus Group
Ryanair said August passenger traffic rose to 3.26 million from 2.57 million a year ago, with load factor, a measure 
of passengers to available seats, falling to 91% from 92%.
GlaxoSmithKline said a study presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in Stockholm showed that 
Arixtra was as effective in preventing death, myocardial infarction and refractory ischaemia at nine days than 
Sanofi-Aventis' Lovenox/Clexane. Arixtra was associated with a 47% reduction in major bleeding than Lovenox.
American National Insurance Co. said that its subsidiaries estimate the pre-tax net loss, net of reinsurance, as a 
result of Hurricane Katrina will be in the $17 million range. Estimated pre-reinsurance losses could reach the $100 
million range based on preliminary modeled losses, including a provision for demand surge and flooded vehicles, 
the Galveston, Texas-based insurance company said.
Ryan's Restaurant Group Inc. (: , , ) said that August same-store sales fell 4%. Excluding the impact of Hurricane 
Katrina, same-store sales would have decreased 3.2%. Total sales for the period fell 1% compared with a year ago 
to $62.1 million, said the Greer, S.C.-based restaurant chain operator. The storm disrupted operations at 13 
restaurants in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Ryan's Restaurant said seven of them remain closed, mainly 
because of power outages, and it hasn't yet determined when they will be re-opened.
Steel Dynamics Inc. said that it has informed its customers that it's suspending order entry for cold rolled, 
galvanized and painted sheet products because of a hydrogen gas supply issue. Steel Dynamics said it was 
informed by Air Products Corp. , its hydrogen gas supplier, that it would be unable to meet Steel Dynamics' 
immediate supply needs because of a New Orleans facility outage due to Hurricane Katrina, as well as a planned 
two-month shutdown of its plant in Sarnia, Ontario. Production of hot rolled and hot rolled pickled and oiled coils will 
not be affected, the Fort Wayne, Ind.-based company said.
Tecumseh Products Co. said that it will be suspending its quarterly dividend until profitability improves. 'The 
company and its board of directors believe that it is in the long-term best interest of shareholders to utilize available 
funds to continue ongoing restructuring efforts and reduce indebtedness,' the Tecumseh, Mich.-based compressor 
and engine maker said in a statement.
US Airways Group Inc. said that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia has approved a deal 
to sell certain Embraer regional jets and slot assets to Republic Airways Holdings Inc. . US Airways said it expects 
the deal to provide it with $100 million in cash upon its closing within next two weeks.
Walgreen Co. will incur expenses in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 because of Hurricane Katrina-related losses 
of inventory, property and equipment, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The 
amount of the expenses hasn't yet been determined, it said. The drugstore operator said 49 of the 74 stores it 
closed in the Gulf Coast states remain closed, and it is unable to determine when those stores will re-open.
After Friday's closing bell, Electronic Arts Inc. said that Don Mattrick, president of worldwide studios, is leaving to 
pursue other opportunities and will be replaced by Paul Lee. David Gardner was named chief operating officer for 
worldwide studios. The Redwood City, Calif.-based video game company also appointed Gerhard Florin executive 
vice president of international publishing and Frank Gibeau executive vice president of North American publishing. 
Nancy Smith was named executive vice president and general manager of the Sims franchise.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is to withdraw 12 flights per week at Newquay airport following the 
decision by Cornwall County Council to impose a 5 stg surcharge on departing passengers from the airport.
The budget airline will reduce its Newquay-London Stansted route to a single flight per day, and said the move 
would result in a loss to the airport of 100,000 passengers annually.
Michael Cawley, Deputy CEO of Ryanair, described the council's decision to levy the charge as 'ridiculous' and 
'misguided' and said the airline would keep its daily flight under review 'with the possibility of further reductions in 
the future if demand deteriorates further'.

MADRID (AFX) - Share prices were lower in thin midday trade on fears over rising oil prices ahead of US reserve 
data, with leading banks BBVA and SCH, as well as steel issues like Acerinox and Arcelor suffering, dealers said.
At 11.46 am, the IBEX-35 index was down 57.4 points at 10,046.7, after trading in a range of 10,032-10,085 on thin 
turnover of 1.310 bln eur, with put-throughs accounting for about 60 pct.
The IBEX-NM lost 1.7 points to 2,651.0.
Equities opened lower, depressed by Wall Street's overnight losses, and stayed in the red through the morning, 
pressured by rising oil prices in quiet trade ahead of key US data.
'It's very quiet today with half the traders out on vacation and the other half unwilling to take positions,' a salesman 
at a local brokerage said.
'Indices throughout Europe are generally expected to continue adjusting downward over the next couple of days,' 
he added.
Main banks were under pressure, with SCH off 0.11 eur at 9.91 and BBVA down 0.13 at 13.74.
Steel issues were also on offer, with Arcelor down 0.28 at 17.6 and Acerinox shedding 0.13 to 12.0, depressed by 
concerns over demand and prices in China.
'Global steel companies are seeing losses after the Chinese company Baosteel said that it will reduce prices in the 
fourth quarter by 10 pct on significant overcapacity in China,' the salesman said.
Telefonica lost 0.08 to 13.63, weighed down by nervousness in the telecom industry after Google announced plans 
to offer voice options over its new messenger service.
'All telecommunication companies in Europe have seen some losses after this announcement by the internet 
search engine,' a broker said.
Other TMTs were also lower, with Gamesa down 0.1 at 11.99 on profit-taking, Prisa shedding 0.11 to 14.84 and 
Sogecable off 0.24 at 28.87.
Altadis advanced 0.18 to 35.89, as it recovered from earlier profit-taking to extend yesterday's gains.
Madrid shares lower midday on oil concerns; main banks, steel issues down
Also among the session's handful of gainers, Cintra rose 0.03 to 10.53, Avanzit put on 0.04 or 2.6 pct at 1.58 and 
Puleva Biotech was 0.03 higher at 2.65.
Iberia was flat at 2.23, but outperformed the broad market as European traders sold shares in low cost carriers such 
as EasyJet and RyanAir in favour of the larger carriers.

FRANKFURT (AFX) - Niki Lauda, former Formula 1 race car driver and owner of the no-frills airline Niki is expecting 
a consolidation in Europe's no-frills airline industry, according to an article to be published in Monday's 
Handelsblatt.
'The larger ones will win the cut-throat competition,' Lauda said.
Only Easyjet, Ryanair and, a little further down the line, Air Berlin have reached the critical size needed to finance 
flights to lucrative destinations.
Air Berlin holds a 24 pct stake in Niki, and Lauda did not rule out that Niki will expand its cooperation with Air Berlin.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) - Airline stocks traded lower across the board Friday as broader market weakness 
overcame the sector and crude-oil prices pushed past $66 a barrel to new high.
The Amex Airline Index fell 0.8% to 47.52 points and is off 1.9% for the week. 
Crude-oil futures set a high on Thursday, threatening the cash-strapped sector with higher-yet fuel bills.
Crude oil prices topped $66 a barrel in early trading Friday.
United Airlines , Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines raised fares this week to help offset higher fuel costs.
No stock in the index rose, though Southwest Airlines was off only 1 cent at $13.69.
Delta Air Lines , the most active stock in the sector this week, continued to see heavy trading on Friday with a 4.5% 
decline to $1.71.
Northwest Airlines fell 1.2% to $4.06. The airline's chief executive officer said Thursday that the company needs to 
continue cutting labor expenses and other costs even if it means risking a strike by its mechanics union.
British Airways' shares were off 0.7% in New York trading following the airline's halt of Heathrow flights after a labor 
dispute at its catering company spread to other ground workers.
Ryanair Holdings advanced 1.6% to $47.68 in U.S. trading.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has been upgraded to 'hold' from 'reduce' by ABN Amro on valuation 
grounds, dealers said.
ABN explained that Ryanair is now trading close to its 6.55 eur target price. 
The target represents a 5 pct premium to the broker's discounted cashflow fair value of 6.10 eur, reflecting the 
momentum behind the stock and investor appreciation of the management team's strength.
Ryanair trades on a price/earnings multiple of 16 times 2006 forecasts compared with easyJet PLC's September 
2006 15.2 times, noted ABN. The broker added that, relative to US low-cost carriers, both Ryanair and easyJet 
appear
cheap.

WARSAW (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Irish low-cost airline, is planning to increase further its presence in 
Poland, Puls Biznesu reported.
According to unofficial sources, the company is considering opening several new routes, including flights to 
Katowice, Deblin, Lublin-Niedzwiada, Szczytno and Bialystok.
'We will announce 2-3 routes this year, then we will increase the number of flights on the best routes to 2-3 per day, 
and then we will start operations to new airports', the Ryanair managing director Michael O'Leary said.
'Twelve months ago I believed it made no sense flying to Poland. I've changed my mind. In 2006, we will have 1 
million passengers on our routes to Poland, and 5 million within next five years,' O'Leary said.
In the autumn, Ryanair will start flights to Bydgoszcz, Gdansk, Krakow, Lodz, Poznan, Rzeszow and Szczecin.
It is possible that the Irish low-cost carrier will also build a base in Poland, Puls Biznesu said.
'This investment is possible in 2007. Three airports are taken into consideration, including Wroclaw. If growth rate 
remains high, we will consider launching a second base in Poland,' O'Leary said.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC slipped lower in midmorning trade after ABN Amro downgraded 
the discount airline to 'reduce' from 'hold' on valuation grounds, said dealers.
Yesterday's first-quarter results from Ryanair were strong, noted ABN, benefiting from the solid revenue 
environment. 
As a result, ABN has raised its net earnings forecast for 2006 by 5 pct to 312 mln eur, ahead of Ryanair's guidance 
of 295 mln eur.
However, ABN pointed out that Ryanair's stock has risen by 51 pct over the past 12 months and is now at the top of 
its trading range.
ABN argued that, notwithstanding fuel costs, it is hard to see how the revenue side of the business could improve 
as a lack of new low-cost entry, surcharges, charter carrier reduction and still-confident European consumers 
provide an unbeatable trading environment.
ABN has raised its price target on Ryanair to 6.4 eur from 6.3.
At 10.49 am, shares in Ryanair were down 0.01 eur at 6.86.

PRESS COMMENT
The Lex Column: BOC (Lates results were unexplosive. Pretax Q3 profit fell 9 pct year-on-year. However, the 
market had been alert to the causes. More
positively, there was continued strong performance in the gases business, which generates four-fifths of group 
profits. Investors seeking upside from here will have to look hard indeed for catalysts); Dollar (With investors focus 
switching back from yield to structural trade concerns, the dollar's strength against the euro may have run its 
AFX UK - at a glance share guide - 2
course); Ryanair (Ryanair's cost control will struggle to deliver any margin improvement. Unit costs, up 6 pct over 
the quarter, would have fallen 9 pct but for fuel. Last June, Ryanair warned of a winter 'bloodbath' for the airline 
sector. Its prediction may just have been a year early.); Alliance & Leicester (The yield is a fat 6 pct, but yesterday's 
7 pct rise, down from the 10 pct increases of past years, leaves investors with little to look forward to)
Times
Rumour of the Day: RENURON (Understood to have delayed pricing of its IPO in order to meet with a new batch of 
potential US investors. Seeking to raise 10 mln stg in deal that would value business at 30 mln stg) Smaller stock to 
watch: ADWALKER (Shares ticked up 2 pence to 10 yesterday after the maker of electronic sandwich boards made 
debut on AIM) Tempus: ALLIANCE&LEICESTER (The shares are worth holding for the yield, but not much more); 
Ryanair (has proved a formidable competitor in a difficult environment but there is little obvious value in the shares); 
PZ CUSSONS At 11.90 stg, PZ Cussons trades on a 14 times forecast earnings multiple, mitigated by a 3 pct 
dividend yield. Hold.)
Telegraph
Questor: ALLIANCE & LEICESTER (Stay away from A&L for time being); MORGAN CRUCIBLE (At 203-1/2 pence, 
the shares trade on 15 times earnings and although there is no dividend yet, it's worth picking up a few more even 
at these levels); NESTOR HEALTHCARE (At 11 times forward earnings with a prospective yield of 1.5 pct, Questor 
can see no reason to buy)
Independent
BOC GROUP (Still fairly priced as long-term investment); PZ CUSSONS (Shares look too pricey)

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has reported a record first-quarter net profit but said its outlook for the 
balance of the year is 'cautious' as it continues to budget for higher oil prices.
The Dublin-based no-frills airline noted that bookings were down for a number of days in the immediate aftermath of 
each of the two terrorist attacks in London on July 7 and July 21.
'If there are no further such attacks in London then we expect that our forward bookings will not be materially 
impacted,' said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
'However, if there are further incidents in London, both bookings and yields could be adversely impacted.'
For the time being Ryanair still plans to grow traffic by approximately 27 pct to 35 mln passengers in the year to 
end-March 2006.
For the quarter to June 30 2005 the carrier made an adjusted profit after tax (net profit) of 64.4 mln eur, up from 
53.1 mln eur last time, reflecting a 30 pct increase in passengers to 8.5 mln and a 3 pct rise in yields (average 
fares) despite a 30 pct increase in seat capacity. Total revenues rose 35 pct to 404.6 mln eur.
Ryanair attributed the passenger growth and higher yields to the multiple fuel surcharges imposed by the European 
flag carriers on their short-haul passengers, with the latest round of increases imposed in June, and their removal of 
capacity from these markets.
'These surcharges continue to widen the gap between their high fares and Ryanair's low fares,' maintained O'Leary.
'Both Ryanairs traffic growth and yields have significantly benefited from our commitment not to impose fuel 
surcharges on our passengers.'
Ryanair's unit costs increased by 6 pct as fuel costs rose by 112 pct to 109.9 mln eur. Excluding fuel unit costs fell 9 
pct.
Consequently adjusted after tax margin for the quarter fell by 2 points to 16 pct. Basic earnings per share rose 21 
pct to 8.47 cents.
Ryanair Q1 net profit up 21 pct; outlook 'cautious'
'Our outlook for the remainder of the year is cautious as we continue to budget for higher oil prices but anticipate 
that these will be partly offset by a combination of other cost reductions and the current benign yield environment,' 
said O'Leary.

LONDON (AFX) - British police said they freed without charge two men who had been detained under anti-terrorism 
laws at a train station in northeast England after determining they had nothing to do with extremists.
The pair were arrested last night at Grantham railway station under the Terrorism Act as they travelled from 
Newcastle to Kings Cross station in London, Lincolnshire police said.
'Following extensive inquiries during today we are now satisfied that the men arrested from the (...) train at 
Grantham at 11 pm last night are not connected to any terrorist activity,' a Lincolnshire Police spokesman said.
'They have been released from our custody without any charge and the matter is now closed,' the spokesman said.
Meanwhile, Bedfordshire police said they freed a man who they had detained for several hours today under anti-
terrorism laws, who was about to board an airplane from Luton airport to France.
The statement added that 'the gentleman has been extremely helpful to police officers' and police would now help 
him make his onward journey after he missed his flight on Ryanair which had been delayed for security checks.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC's bookings on flights destined for London have fallen by up to a third since 
the bombs last Thursday, the Times reported, citing chief executive Michael O'Leary.
The CEO said across the system bookings were down almost 10 pct in the first four days after the attacks, equating 
to about 8,000 sales a day and costing the airline almost 1 mln stg in lost revenue.
The Irish-based budget airline is slashing prices on fares for August, the paper said, the peak holiday month 
normally priced at a premium. A third of its capacity over the next three months, or 3 mln seats, will be sold at one 
pound or one euro, plus taxes.
On a normal day a fifth of Ryanair's 100,000 daily passengers originate in Europe and travel to London airports.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) - Led by a 7.8% gain in Northwest Airlines shares, airline stocks turned higher in 
afternoon trading Friday and paced a broad market upturn.
The Amex Airline Index rose 3% to 47.60 points, wiping out the holiday-shortened week's losses.
Northwest added 7.8% to $4.45 on volume of 4.1 million shares.
The most active stock at more than 5 million shares was Delta Air Lines , up 2.1% to $3.45.
Stocks were helped higher by declining crude oil futures even as Hurricane Dennis approached the Gulf of Mexico 
and threatened petroleum-industry infrastructure there.
AMR Corp. , American Airlines' parent, gained 3.9% to $12.55.
Southwest Airlines rose 0.7% to $13.88; the profitable low-fare airline kicks off the sector's earnings season next 
week.
Frontier Airlines rose 5.2% to $11.29 as one of the strongest gainers outside the index.
U.S.-listed shares of British Airways and Ryanair Holdings advanced after Thursday's terror attack on London's 
subway and bus system.

SINGAPORE (AFX) - Tiger Airways said it is not keen to pursue an alliance even though its Singapore-based 
competitors Valuair and Jetstar Asia, which is owned by Qantas Airways, are reportedly pursuing discussions to 
forge an alliance.
'It doesn't worry me, I think we feel we already are stronger than our competitors locally, our objective is to be a 
regional player,' Tiger Airways CEO Tony Davis told reporters at briefing.
'This is how we are going to grow (our business) and it's within our control. I wouldn't pursue an alliance,' he added.
Davis' comments comes after the Business Times reported that Valuair and Jetstar Asia were in talks for a possible 
alliance, a sign that budget carriers are seeking to consolidate their positions given the tough operating 
environment.
Tiger Airways had previously targetted breaking even in the first year of its operations but Davis sidestepped the 
issue when asked by reporters this morning on whether the airline is on track to meet its target
'I think if the business was not self-sufficient by three years you'd start to question (the company). At the moment, 
we are only 9 months (old) and it shows we are managing a very efficient operation,' Davis said.
'We are not chasing a hypothetical breakeven situation just so we can say we break even in the first year, because 
we see the long-term profitability is far more important than short-term,' he added.
Tigers Airways is also actively looking out for partners and looking to set up a secondary base in Asia in its 
expansion plans, Davis said.
'We are looking at setting up a secondary base somewhere in Asia ... We're in negotiations with several potential 
partners ... We are looking for partners that can offer us a wider geographical spread across Asia,' Davis said.
Davis said Tiger Airways is eyeing Malaysia and Indonesia.
'The biggest thing that would transform our market place is if Malaysia or Indonesia sign an open skies agreement 
with Singapore,' he said.
'Sometimes nothing happens for months and suddenly there's a breakthrough ... We are positioned to take 
advantage of the opportunities out there,' he added.
Singapore 's Tiger Airways not keen to pursue alliance with other airlines
Tiger Airways is owned 49 pct by Singapore Airlines. Other shareholders include state-linked Singapore investment 
company Temasek Holdings, Ryanair founder Tony Ryan and US private private equity firm Indigo Partners.
It currently flies to Bangkok, Macau, Chiang Mai, Ho Chi Minh, Hanoi, Manila, Padang, Phuket and Hat Yai.
The airline is expanding its fleet to 12 Airbus A320s by 2007 from four currently. It had just placed an order for eight 
A320 planes for 500 mln usd from Airbus Industrie.
Davis estimates that upon completion of the expansion in 2007, Tiger Airways will carry 4-5 mln passengers 
annually.

LONDON (AFX) - EasyJet PLC has been upgraded to 'overweight' from 'underweight' by Morgan Stanley, with the 
broker keeping its 'equalweight' stance on peer Ryanair Holdings PLC, dealers said.
Looking firstly at easyJet, Morgan Stanley explained its upgrade today is based on the belief that fresh 
management, better revenue visibility and recognition of cost saving opportunities represent new catalysts.
While Morgan Stanley noted the bear case on easyJet of flat margins keeps it wary of downside risk, the broker 
now has greater confidence in margin recovery.
Besides fuel cost, Morgan Stanley feels the risk to earnings is limited and a new restructuring-minded management 
team will be incentivised to look for fresh ideas to improve margins.
While Morgan Stanley has a 300 pence target for easyJet, the broker argued that under its best-case scenario, a 
share price of 400 pence could be achieved.
As for Ryanair, Morgan Stanley noted its investment case for the stock is cautious for the medium term owing to 
capacity growth, competition and fuel price pressure.
However, the US broker still argued that its analysis can comfortably support a valuation for Ryanair 40-55 pct 
ahead of today's levels, or around 9-10 eur per share - the broker's fair value stands at 8 eur per share.
Morgan Stanley highlighted that trading conditions are likely to be volatile near term, so it is reluctant to call for 
outperformance over the next 12 months. However, the broker believes there could be 'opportunities to build 
positions in a longer-term, cash-generative success story'.

LOS ANGELES (AFX) -- Shares of the European oil companies with U.S. listings rose Monday, while airlines and 
auto stocks fell as crude prices stayed strong.
The Bank of New York European American Depositary Index fell 0.02 point to close at 123.44, while the overall 
composite index fell 0.06 point to close at 119.65.
European shares closed broadly lower Monday as pressure from record crude-oil prices spread beyond traditionally 
oil-sensitive airline and car stocks to depress general market sentiment. Earlier in Europe, the German DAX 30 
index finished down 0.9%, France's CAC 40 index fell 1% ,and London's FTSE 100 index closed down 0.7%.
Prices for the August crude contract hit a high of $60.95 a barrel during the New York session Monday, the highest 
price yet for the front-month contract.
Shares of Royal Dutch Petroleum jumped $1.20, or 1.9%, to $64.45. Shares of BP rose 55 cents to $64.05 and 
Total gained 79 cents to $118.04. Statoil rose 29 cents, or 1.5%, to $19.87.
Higher oil prices were not good news, though, for auto-related stocks. Tomkins fell 37 cents, or 1.9%, to $19.18; 
Fiat lost 20 cents, or 2.8%, to $7.07; and DaimlerChrysler fell 11 cents to $40.63.
Airlines also were hurt. BA sank $2.44, or 4.9%, to $47.61, while Ryanair fell 97 cents, or 2.1%, to $45.01, and Air 
France-KLM dropped 26 cents, or 1.7%, to $15.08.
Bigger tech and telecom names were also weaker. STMicroelectronics fell 26 cents, or 1.6%, to $15.69; Arm 
Holdings fell 10 cents, or 1.5%, to $6.45; and Alcatel fell 15 cents, or 1.4%, to $10.83.
Advertising group WPP fell 49 cents, or 1%, to $52.71 after saying that comparable revenue rose 6% during the first 
five months of 2005, with operating margins ahead of the anticipated 14.3%.
Meanwhile, TNT fell 34 cents, or 1.3%, to $25 after the company said it's not buying the minority stake in Belgian 
De Post/La Poste that the Belgian government is offering.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has been upgraded to 'hold' from 'reduce' at ABN Amro, with the broker 
arguing that the company should benefit from the long-term structural changes going on in the charter market, 
dealers said.
Looking at the short-haul market in Europe, ABN has concluded that charter carriers have significantly reduced 
exposure in low-cost markets and network carriers are seeking longer routes less exposed to low-cost carrier 
competition. 
The Dutch-based broker expects these two trends to continue and to provide long-term support for both easyJet 
PLC and Ryanair.
The next significant datapoint for Ryanair should be the first-quarter results on Aug 2, said ABN. The broker 
highlighted that chief executive Michael O'Leary recently commented that he was 'happy' with current trading, which 
suggest that underlying trading through the June quarter will have been pretty decent.
Yet, ABN pointed out it expects a considerable impact from fuel as Ryanair was hedged in the June quarter last 
year but is not this year.
ABN kept its 6.30 eur target on Ryanair and said it has maintained its view that there is more upside from playing 
easyJet than Ryanair.

VILNIUS (AFX) - Lithuania's Kaunas airport said it has concluded negotiations with Ryanair Holdings PLC to begin 
flying to the Baltic state.
'The negotiations are finished, but all the details are to be announced by representatives of the Irish company,' 
Kestutis Cucenas, head of Kaunas airport said.
'Representatives of Ryanair will hold a briefing in Kaunas on Tuesday,' he added.
In February, the Baltic state in February sent letters to eight low-cost European airlines inviting them to begin 
service to the Baltic state, but only received a reply from Ryanair.
Ryanair had expressed interest earlier in serving the Baltic state and had been in negotiations with Lithuanian 
officials.
But the talks failed because, according to Lithuanian officials, Ryanair was asking for a disguised fee to enter the 
Lithuanian market.
The transport ministry earlier said that it was ready to provide the necessary infrastructure for Kaunas airport and 
would organize public transport from Vilnius to the second-largest city, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) away.
Lithuania, which joined the European Union last last year saw a boost to airline passenger traffic this year.
Passenger numbers at Vilnius International Airport surged by 43 pct to 443,700 between January and May 
compared to the same period in 2004 and is expected to reach between 1.2 and 1.25 mln for the whole of 2005.
The number of flights served by the airport in January to May soared by 47 pct to reach 11,700 compared to the 
same period a year ago.
Kaunas airport to date mainly served cargo flights.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) - Airline stocks failed to log any significant gains in early trading on Monday as spot crude 
oil prices topped $59 a barrel for the first time ever.
The Amex Airline Index held mostly steady at 48.99 points with trading action mostly mixed.
AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines , paced percentage advancers, up more than 
1% each. On the downside, Alaska Air Group shed 1.4% to $29.98.
JetBlue Airways gained almost 1% to $21.70 after it announced a deal to issue credit cards with American Express 
. With the new card, holders can earn points in the JetBlue rewards program. The deal is the first of its kind for the 
New York-based carrier.
Elsewhere, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings shed 3% to $44.22 and AirTran Holdings lost 1.4% to $9.65.

Explosion at Spain 's Zaragoza airport after warning call from ETA

MADRID (AFX) - An explosion has been reported about 300 metres from Zaragoza airport in Spain but caused no 
casualties, an airport source said.
The explosion apparently followed a warning call from armed separatist group ETA to the Basque daily Gara, 
according to local news reports.
All flights were suspended as police sealed off the zone to comb the area amid media reports three rocket 
launchers and at least two mortars had been found.
A Ryanair plane from London was diverted to a nearby military airport following the blast, media quoted airport 
officials as saying.
The Basque newspaper Gara said it had received a phone call purporting to be from ETA and warning of a blast 
before the incident occurred, just before midday (10.00 GMT).
The paper said the caller had identified the target and warned of a blast between midday and 2 pm.
'There were few people in the Zaragoza terminal which had been evacuated as a preventative measure before the 
explosion,' a spokesman for Spanish airport authority AENA said.
Spanish anti-terrorist sources said it appeared that a hand grenade had exploded but Gara, which received the 
anonymous telephone call an hour beforehand, using codewords to describe ETA, reported there could have been 
two mortars fired.

STOCKWATCH Ryanair downgraded to 'reduce' at ABN as good news priced in
STOCKWATCH Ryanair downgraded to 'reduce' at ABN as good news priced 
in

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has been downgraded to 'reduce' from 'add' by ABN Amro, with the broker 
arguing that the good news is already priced in to the shares, dealers said.
In its report to clients, ABN highlighted that Ryanair's fourth quarter performance 'blasted through the markets' 
expectations thanks to an extremely strong passenger yield'.
ABN has raised its net earnings forecast by 6 pct for March 2006 to 296 mln eur and 14 pct for March 2007 to 341 
mln eur. The broker now forecasts traffic
to be 35 mln next year rather than previous guidance of 34 mln.
Yet in ABN's view, the good news about Ryanair is 'out there' and the next significant catalyst should be the first-
quarter results on August 2. The broker noted that underlying trading through the June quarter will have been 
benign to fantastic, but the lack of Easter will hold back revenues, while the impact from fuel will be considerable, as 
Ryanair is not hedged this year.
In addition, ABN said it would not be astonished to see a placing by either the Ryan family or chief executive 
following the roadshows this month. ABN highlighted that in the past, CEO O'Leary has sold stakes on the market 
following results at times when the stock is trading relatively strongly.
ABN has lifted its price target on Ryanair to 6.3 eur from 6.2.
Also in the sector today, easyJet PLC reported in-line May traffic statistics and reiterated full year guidance.
At 8.39 am, shares in Ryanair were steady at 6.64 eur, while easyJet was up 3-1/2 pence at 230.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in easyJet PLC edged higher in opening deals on the back of in-line May traffic statistics 
and an easing of oil prices overnight, said traders.
easyJet announced earlier today that May traffic rose 21.9 pct to 2.55 mln passengers, while load factor was 84.1 
pct, up from 81.1 pct.
The low cost airline said it continues to expect pretax profit in the year to Sept 2005 to be below last year but in line 
with current expectations.
Meanwhile, oil prices retreated in Asian trade, falling below 55 usd a barrel as investor concerns over a supply 
crunch dissipated.
UBS said it remains cautious on easyJet given the immaturity of its routes and the growth of Ryanair Holdings PLC 
at key bases. The broker added it is also somewhat concerned over the fragility of the UK consumer and is 
forecasting a 1 pct decline in the average yield this summer.
Nonetheless, UBS feels easyJet remains in a strong longer term position underpinned by its strong balance sheet, 
brand and competitive position and the broker suspects that revenue risk could still be on the upside.
UBS maintained its 'neutral' rating and 240 pence target on easyJet.
Elsewhere, NCB said easyJet's passenger numbers are in line with the load factor very strong. NCB remains happy 
with its 'accumulate' recommendation on easyJet.
At 8.11 am, shares in easyJet were up 3 at 229-1/2, while the FTSE 250 was 7.1 points higher at 7,197.6.

Alitalia restructuring plan wins conditional approval from EU
Alitalia restructuring plan wins conditional approval from EU

BRUSSELS (AFX) - The European Commission said it has conditionally approved a restructuring plan for state-
owned Italian airline Alitalia SpA, which the Italian government hopes will save the loss-making national flagcarrier.
Jacques Barrot, European transport commissioner, said the plan put forward by the Italian government could 
proceed, providing strict conditions are respected.
'On the basis of a thorough and detailed analysis, the commission has concluded that these recapitalisations do not 
involve any state aid,' said Barrot.
The Italian government is prevented from giving state aid to Alitalia under EU laws, which bar governments from 
propping up national companies more than once in a ten-year period.
Alitalia was granted 1.42 bln eur by the Italian government between 1997 and 2002.
The EU investigation focused on plans to split the company into two parts, AZ Fly and AZ Services, which are the 
flight operations and ground-handling services respectively.
AZ Fly will be recapitalised via a planned 1.2 bln eur share sale, while AZ Services will benefit from a 216 mln eur 
investment from state holding company Fintecna.
The commission concluded that both operations were permissible, providing the investments were done according 
to 'private investor principles'.
In the case of the capital increase for AZ Fly, the commission has received a formal guarantee from Deutsche 
Bank, which will manage the sale, that the state will not be given preferential treatment and that the majority of 
shares will be sold to private investors.
Deutsche Bank has offered to underwrite the capital increase without any guarantees from the state, the 
commission said.
For Fintecna, the commission is satisfied that the state company is acting in the same way as a private investor, 
and is paying a suitable price for the investment.
Alitalia restructuring plan wins conditional approval from EU
These two operations are in addition to plans for a sharp reduction in personnel and other operational efficiency 
measures. Alitalia posted an operating loss of 400 mln eur in 2004 and is forecast to make losses of 100 mln this 
year.
The decision is bound to be condemned by rival airlines, who have lobbied the commission vigorously to block the 
rescue plan.
British Airways, Lufthansa and Ryanair have all spoken out, and are convinced the plan constitutes unfair help from 
the Italian government. In particular, they claim the plan unfairly transfers the debt of the group to the services 
company.
They also accuse Alitalia of breaching the rules of a 400 mln eur emergency loan made to the company last July, 
which was approved with conditions by the EU.
Alitalia was accused of using the money to lower prices and expand capacity, which were prohibited under 
conditions for approval imposed by the EU.
'The commission noted that the conditions imposed on Alitalia for the use of the bridging loan authorised in 2004 
have been respected up to this point,' the commission said in its statement.
The loan will be repaid by the company after the recapitalisation of AZ Fly is complete.
'It (the commission) will continue to ensure that all the conditions imposed on the Italian authorities are complied 
with,' the commission said.
The capital increase for AZ Fly will take place over the summer. The airline will be privatised via the operation, with 
the state's holding in the company falling below 50 pct.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair PLC were weak midmorning amid talk of a 6 mln share placing at 6.50 eur a 
share today and after ABN Amro cut its stance on the discount airline to 'reduce' from 'add', dealers said.
At 10.04 am, Ryanair shares were 0.09 eur lower at 6.55.
Traders noted that Irish stockbroker Davy was reported to be placing the 6 mln shares in the airline on behalf of 
Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, with the offering said to be 'well-covered'.
Presciently, in its note published today revealing the downgrade in rating, ABN Amro said it would not be 
astonished to see a placing by either the Ryan family or the airline's chief executive following the group's 
roadshows this month.
ABN Amro also highlighted the fact that in the past, CEO O'Leary has sold stakes on the market following results at 
times when the stock is trading relatively strongly.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has been downgraded to 'hold' from 'buy' at Citigroup, with the broker 
advising investors to wait for a better buying opportunity, said dealers.
The downgrade reflects a recent 15 pct increase in Ryanair's share price prior to last week's full year results and 
only 10 pct upside to Citigroup's new target price of 7.2 eur (versus 6.9), insufficient compared to the 15 pct upside 
needed to justify a 'buy' rating on a Medium risk stock.
Ryanair's full year results were better than expected and consequently, Citigroup has raised its 2006 and 2007 EPS 
forecasts by an average 10 pct.
The broker continues to expect flat EPS in the current year to March 2006 - with 29 pct revenue growth offset by 60 
pct higher fuel costs leading to a 4.5 percentage point fall in operating margin.
Finally, Citigroup said it believes Ryanair has the strongest business model for a European airline in terms of its 
lowest-cost advantage, continued growth prospects and strong balance sheet.
At 8.45 am, shares in Ryanair were up 0.05 eur at 6.71.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) -- Increased traffic at Continental Airlines combined with an overnight pullback in crude-oil 
prices to set a bullish tone for the airline sector Thursday.
The Amex Airline Index gained 1.7% to 50.25 in early action, with the price of oil giving back some of its steep gains 
from Wednesday.
Among individual stocks, Continental Airlines led percentage advancers, up 4.4% at $14.17. The Houston-based 
carrier reported late Wednesday a 10.8% jump in traffic in May.
Other notable gainers included Delta Air Lines and JetBlue Airways , both of which rose more than 3% to $3.95 and 
$21.95, respectively.
Moving outside the index, shares of Ryanair , which have almost doubled in the past seven months, edged higher 
to $46.16.
The Irish low-cost airline said passenger traffic in May rose 34% to 2.9 million from a year ago, as its load factor, a 
measure of passengers to available seats, increased to 82% from 81%.
Alaska Air Group was the biggest loser on the day, down 1.8% to $29.14.
Air France-KLM dipped less than 1% $15.66, while AirTran Holdings lost 1.5% to $9.74.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has been downgraded to 'neutral' from 'outperform' by CSFB on valuation 
grounds, following solid full-year results from the discount airline yesterday, said dealers.
CSFB has raised its target price on Ryanair to 7.1 eur from 7.0 and noted its own forecast is 6-7 pct ahead of the 
2006 earnings consensus forecasts.
A better entry point for the shares may develop over the summer, advised CSFB.
Meanwhile, SG Securities reiterated its 'buy' rating on Ryanair, raising its fair value target to 6.9 eur from 5.8 eur.
'Solid outlook and good earnings' resilience lead us to adopt Ryanair as our preferred stock in the sector', said SG 
in a note to clients.

LONDON (AFX) - Investors will focus on the outlook for yields or average fares when Ryanair Holdings PLC, the 
Dublin-based no-frills airline, reports fourth quarter and annual results today.
For the year to March 31 2005 analysts are forecasting a pretax profit of 253-287 mln eur, up from 228.5 mln eur 
last time.
When Ryanair reported third quarter results in January it flagged quarter four yields would rise by up to 5 pct. But it 
cautioned the upturn is more a reflection of the 22 pct decline in fourth quarter yields in the previous year, slower 
capacity growth and an earlier Easter, rather than some significant price recovery.
The carrier also flagged the high cost of jet fuel (it is unhedged for 2005) and the weakening of sterling as 
continuing issues.
'Key to the outlook is what management says about yields for the coming year,' Williams de Broe analyst Stephen 
Clapham told clients.
'We think it unlikely that they have moved up enough to offset the sharp spike in the price of oil, and we would 
therefore expect to downgrade our numbers for this year.'
Investors will also be keen to hear management's thoughts on the impact of the slowdown in UK consumer 
spending on the low-cost carrier sector.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based no-frills airline, has reported a better-than-expected 19 
pct increase in full-year net profit and said yields or average fares should be 'more stable' in the current year.
The carrier said advance bookings for the summer months are 'strong' and raised its traffic growth forecast for the 
current year from 34 mln, a 23 pct increase, to 35 mln, a rise of 27 pct.
'We continue to budget for higher oil prices, but anticipate that these higher costs will be partially offset by a slightly 
more benign yield environment,' said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
'If our competitors continue to maintain (fuel) surcharges or continue to remove capacity from our markets then 
yields should be more stable, even as we continue to expand.'
For the year to March 31 2005 Ryanair made an adjusted profit after tax (net profit) of 268.9 mln eur, up from 226.6 
mln eur last time.
Revenue was up 24 pct to 1.34 bln eur driven by a 19 pct increase in passengers to 27.6 mln and a 40 pct rise in 
ancillary revenues. Yields were up 2 pct, having fallen 14 pct in the previous year.
Adjusted profit after tax for the year to March 31 2004 excludes the non-recurring costs of 14.9 mln eur arising from 
the earlier-than-planned retirement of six Boeing 737-200 aircraft, the reorganisation of 'Buzz' in April 2003 of 2.7 
mln eur and a goodwill charge of 2.3 mln eur. The goodwill charge for the year to March 31 2005 was 2.1 mln eur.
Basic earnings per share on the same basis increased 18 pct to 35.38 cents.
Pretax profit increased to 295.9 mln eur from 228.5 mln eur.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC were reiterated a 'buy' at Merrill Lynch after the Dublin-based 
no-frills airline reported better-than-expected full year results, dealers said.
In a note to clients, the broker also highlighted the group's upbeat comments on future trading, with the group 
saying 'the outlook for the coming 12 months is more positive than it was this time last year'.
As a result, for the current year Merrill is forecasting operating profit of around 311.5 mln eur, against a consensus 
of 346 mln, and pre-exceptional EPS of 0.34 eur, against a consensus of 0.36.
It added as management is raising passenger volume growth expectations for the current year from 24 pct to 27 
pct, the broker said its yield assumption of -5 pct looks too heavy.
Therefore it believes the balance of risk to its estimates is firmly on the upside.
Earlier, for the year to March 31 2005 Ryanair made an adjusted profit after tax (net profit) of 268.9 mln eur, up from 
226.6 mln eur last time.
Revenue was up 24 pct to 1.34 bln eur driven by a 19 pct increase in passengers to 27.6 mln and a 40 pct rise in

LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares are expected to open higher after the long Bank Holiday weekend as banking 
sector consolidation hopes offset uncertainty over the future of the EU constitution after the 'no-vote' from France, 
dealers said.
Spread bettors IG Index are expecting the FTSE 100 index to open around 6 points higher at 4,992, after closing on 
Friday 8.6 points down at 4,986.3,
Gains though could be be capped by a lack of direction overnight from the US due to Wall Street's closure on 
Monday for Memorial Day. The DJIA ended last week 4.95 points firmer to close at 10,542.55.
Sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic is also set to be cautious ahead of Friday non-farm payrolls in the US.
Economists are tipping the latest data to confirm a softening in the world's biggest economy, with just 193,000 new 
jobs created in May compared with 274,000 in the month before.
Investors will also be keeping a close eye on the implications of France's rejection on Sunday of the EU 
constitution.
Analysts said although the political consequences of the 'no-vote' are still unclear any impact on the markets should 
be limited as the result was already priced in.
Indeed yesterday major European markets closed firmer after German bank HVB confirmed it is in merger talks with 
UniCredito Italiano.
Meanwhile, in Asia overnight, the Nikkei 225 index ended its morning session 30.60 points lower at 11,235.73, 
while at midday the Hang Seng was 55.16 points higher AT 13,900.26.
Back in London, Ryanair will be in focus after the no-frills airline posted an upbeat outlook alongside full-year results 
a touch higher of expectations.
The Dublin-based group posted adjusted profit after tax of 268.9 mln eur against 226.6 mln previously and said the 
outlook is for 'more stable' yields, with advance bookings for summer 'strong'.
London shares outlook - higher as banking consolidation hopes offset EU woes
Little else is pencilled in in in the way of corporate news, but troubled oil explorer Regal Petroleum will also be 
unveiling full-year results after the recent dramatic slump in its share price.
Exploration chief Christopher Green resigned in the wake of shareholder fury over the disappointing drilling results 
at the groups Kallirachi-2 well in Greece.
Still in earnings news, retailer Peacock Group is posting full-year numbers with Investec forecasting pretax profits of 
37.5 mln stg, equivalent to a year-on year increase of 3 pct.
Other smaller companies posting results today are Domestic & General and Hamworthy.
On a quiet day for corporate news, traders will turn to the long weekend newspapers for inspiration.
In focus will be Rentokil Initial, the troubled hygiene and security company, said by the Sunday Times to be mulling 
a 650 mln stg bid for workplace services company PHS Group.
Finally, according to the Sunday Express, leisure group Whitbread
could receive a 700 mln stg bid for its David Lloyd Leisure health club chain from private equity firms.
The newspaper claimed Duke Street Capital, which owns rival health club chain Esporta, had been approached by 
the private equity firms to take on the David Lloyd outlets.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) -- Airline stocks moved mostly higher in early trading Tuesday, with shares of Northwest 
Airlines jumping more than 6% on the heels of a brokerage upgrade.
The Amex Airline Index added 1.5% to 50.22 points. 
JetBlue Airways was the group's lone decliner, off fractionally at $21.63.
Northwest paced advancers after Merrill Lynch lifted the stock to buy from neutral, due primarily to relative 
valuation. While analyst Michael Linenberg said he doesn't think bankruptcy is likely, he believes the threat of one 
may help the company get another $800 million in labor concessions vs. its $1.1 billion savings target.
Investors also bought up Continental Airlines , shares of which gained almost 4% to $13.67.
Separately, Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings posted a 19% surge in full-year profit, excluding charges, and 
maintained a more optimistic stance on the year ahead. U.S.-traded shares gained 3% to $45.69 on the report.
AAR Corp. was another of the sector's big winners, adding almost 5% and touching on a 52-week high of $15.40. 
The aviation support services group said it has been selected by Brit Air, a regional subsidiary of Air France-KLM 
SA, to provide logistics support and component repair services for Brit Air's fleet of 19 Bombardier aircraft for three 
years.
Shares of Air France-KLM fell 3% to $15.92.

LONDON (AFX) -- A weaker start to U.S. markets looked in the cards, as U.S. investors returned from a three-day 
weekend to political instability in Europe, though insurer American International Group may provide some relief after 
finally submitting its 10-K to the Securities and Exchange Commission, with two broker upgrades of key oil stocks 
also a potential lift.
S&P futures fell 3.7 points and Nasdaq 100 futures were off 5.5 points.
The euro has plummeted from over $1.25 before the French referendum on the European Union constitution, to 
$1.2322 after the French voted 'No' and ahead of an expected defeat by Holland of the treaty on Wednesday.
Euro losses extended after Dominique de Villepin was named to replace Jean-Pierre Raffarin as France's prime 
minister. De Villepin is seen as being close to French President Jacques Chirac.
European stock markets haven't moved quite so much. On Monday, Continental markets led by Germany saw 
moderate advances, with a slight pullback in Tuesday.
Focus stocks
American International Group Inc. as expected filed its 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on 
Tuesday, restating previous financial statements and knocking 2.7%, or $2.26 billion, off shareholder equity, down 
to $80.61 billion at Dec. 31, 2004. AIG's net income for 2004 amounted to $9.73 billion, a reduction of $1.32 billion 
or 11.9 percent from the $11.05 billion previously announced in the Feb. 9 earnings release.
Executives at Ameritrade are in advanced talks to take over TD Waterhouse, a unit of Canadian bank Toronto-
Dominion , the Financial Times reported. The newspaper, quoting people familiar with the matter, reported that the 
two discount brokerages moved within 'striking distance' of an agreement over the holiday weekend. The value of 
the transaction was likely to be between $2 billion and $3 billion, the FT said.
Calpine Corp. has agreed to sell a power plant in England to the U.K.'s International Power PLC and Japan's Mitsui 
& Co. Ltd for 500 million pounds ($908 million).
Irish discount airliner Ryanair rose 3.5% on stronger-than-anticipated profit growth and an optimistic outlook.
Wall Street outlook - U.S. stocks set for decline; AIG , oil stocks in focus
The European Court of Justice said it had no jurisdiction to judge GlaxoSmithKline PLC's request to impose quotas 
on patented medicines it supplies to third-party distributors in Europe, sending shares down 0.8%.
Broker notes
Citigroup Smith Barney upgraded U.S. oil companies Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. to buy on Tuesday, 
saying a rebound in the wider equity market alongside a robust earnings outlook for 2006 leaves absolute 
valuations attractive. Chevron Texaco stands out, the bank said, as a combination of operating catalysts and 
valuation makes it one of the most attractive of the oil majors.
Exxon Mobil Corp. was also upgraded to overweight by J.P. Morgan, with the broker citing valuation.
Bear Stearns upgraded British pharmaceuticals firm AstraZeneca PLC to outperform from market perform, citing 
stroke drug Cerovive's increased chances of reaching the market. The broker told clients that Cerovive could be a 
multi-billion dollar compound. Bear Stearns calculated a sales potential for the drug of $3.5 billion, assuming 20% of 
stroke patients receive Cerovive.
Prudential Equity Group upgraded car maker DaimlerChrysler AG to neutral weight from underweight, saying it 
sees a brighter future for Mercedes in 2006. The broker told clients that Mercedes-Benz continues to show 
improvement and that there's 'a good indication that the significant expense the division incurred to address its 
quality issues us starting to yield tangible results.'

LONDON (AFX) - Investors will focus on the outlook for yields or average fares when Ryanair Holdings PLC, the 
Dublin-based no-frills airline, reports fourth quarter and annual results on Tuesday.
For the year to March 31 2005 analysts are forecasting a pretax profit of 253-287 mln eur, up from 228.5 mln eur 
last time.
When Ryanair reported third quarter results in January it flagged quarter four yields would rise by up to 5 pct. But it 
cautioned the upturn is more a reflection of the 22 pct decline in fourth quarter yields in the previous year, slower 
capacity growth and an earlier Easter, rather than some significant price recovery.
The carrier also flagged the high cost of jet fuel (it is unhedged for 2005) and the weakening of sterling as 
continuing issues.
'Key to the outlook is what management says about yields for the coming year,' Williams de Broe analyst Stephen 
Clapham told clients.
'We think it unlikely that they have moved up enough to offset the sharp spike in the price of oil, and we would 
therefore expect to downgrade our numbers for this year.'
Investors will also be keen to hear management's thoughts on the impact of the slowdown in UK consumer 
spending on the low-cost carrier sector.

KUALA LUMPUR (AFX) - Macquarie Securities said it has rated budget carrier AirAsia Bhd as 'outperform' but is 
cutting its target price to 1.90 rgt a share from 2.07 rgt previously after disappointing quarterly results.
The budget carrier recently said it will not be able to meet its initial public offering net profit forecast of 159.88 mln 
rgt for the year to June 2005.
In a note, Macquarie said that AirAsia's third quarter to March 2005 net profit of 40.7 mln rgt was below its forecast 
of 49.4 mln. The consensus range was 40-51 mln.
The budget carrier said the lower quarter-on-quarter net profit was attributable to fewer-than-expected aircraft in 
operation, higher fuel costs and the dampening of air travel sentiment following the tsunami disaster, multiple 
earthquakes off Sumatra and unrest in southern Thailand.
'Whilst the company had previously flagged an aircraft shortage, we were surprised by its extent,' Macquarie said.
The brokerage added that AirAsia's net margin, however, was higher than expected at 24.8 pct.
It said the delay in introducing aircraft has the effect of transferring this year's growth into next year.
Macquarie said AirAsia, which announced comprehensive fuel hedging arrangements for fiscal year to June 2006, 
should further reduce its exposure to high fuel costs.
'Whilst we expect an initial negative reaction to the third quarter numbers, visibility and the company's risk profile for 
fiscal year to June 2006 are improving,' it added.
The brokerage said aircraft availability risk will decline from December, when deliveries of the new Airbus A320 
aircraft begin.
It added that a lack of aircraft has resulted in slower growth rather than deterioration in underlying margins.
'However, lower capacity availability means a reduced fiscal year to June 2005 net income forecast of 123 mln rgt 
from 142 mln previously,' it said.
Macquarie said it is also lowering its fiscal year to June 2006 net income forecast by eight pct to 196 mln rgt.
BROKER CALL - Malaysia 's AirAsia rated 'outperform' - Macquarie Securities
The brokerage said it is expecting AirAsia to deliver 40 pct per annum average earnings growth over the next three 
years.
It added that the new Airbus aircraft should lower unit cost by 15 pct and eliminate aircraft timing risk.
Macquarie said that in the medium term, it is expecting a large profit upside from AirAsia's associates.
'We continue to set our price target at 22.5 times fiscal year to June 2006 forecast earnings, which represents the 
mid-point of the typical 20-25 times historical trading range of its main global peers,' it added.
The brokerage said that AirAsia is trading at 18 times fiscal year to December 2006 price earnings ratio, which is in 
line with Europe's no frills carrier Ryanair and a 25 pct discount to US' Southwest Airlines, despite their slower 
growth profiles.
It added that the global low cost carrier peer group average for fiscal year to December 2006 forecast stands at 
22.7 times.
At 3:53pm, AirAsia was up 0.01 rgt at 1.52.

RIGA (AFX) - A recruitment advertisement placed by low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC in a Latvian business 
daily violated the Baltic state's laws, Latvia's Competition Council has ruled.
Ryanair published an advertisement in Latvian business daily Dienas Biznes in February, announcing a 'pilot-luring 
day in Riga -- the native city of airBaltic national carrier', the advertising standards watchdog said.
'In the newspaper advertisements, Ryanair used the abbreviated form of airBaltic four times. The Competition 
Council found that the name airBaltic was used without its owner's permission,' the advertising standards body said.
Latvian advertising law prohibits the use of the 'name, label or any other identification of another company without 
its permission, unless it is a comparative advertisement.'
The ad promised airBaltic pilots 'an opportunity to work for the number one cheap flights company in Europe' and 
'number one airline in terms of profit in Europe'.
Despite the ruling, Ryanair has not been punished, because the advertisement was published only one time, after 
the Irish company was made aware of the violation, the competition watchdog said.
Ryanair operates ex-Riga routes to London, Frankfurt and Tampere, Finland.

LONDON (AFX) - easyJet PLC, the Luton-based no-frills airline which earlier this week revealed its chief executive 
Ray Webster is retiring early, is expected to reveal a small widening in pretax losses when it reports interim results 
today.
For the six months to March 31, 2005 analysts are forecasting a consensus loss before taxation, goodwill 
amortisation and exceptional items of 24 mln stg compared to a loss of 18.5 mln stg last time.
On a reported basis they predict a pretax loss of 33 mln stg versus a loss of 27.3 mln stg. As usual no dividend is 
expected.
easyJet, which operates 202 routes across 61 European airports, historically makes the majority of its profits in the 
last quarter of its financial year and has only once made a first half profit since it floated in 2000.
In a March 22 update the airline said trading conditions remained stable in the first half. Total revenue per 
passenger for the six months to end-March was flagged to increase by 1-2 pct compared to the same period in the 
previous year, helped by the early Easter this year. Growth in passenger numbers was flagged at 24 pct.
easyJet said that despite the high cost of jet fuel, first half operating margins were expected to match last year's, 
while cash on the balance sheet was anticipated to exceed 600 mln stg.
Inevitably investors will focus on the airline's guidance for the balance of the year.
Stephen Clapham, transport analyst at Williams de Broe, is cautious on easyJet's prospects given the background 
of increasing concern on the outlook for UK consumer spending.
'The reality is that the fuel cost remain's anybody's guess, and that, at some point, the UK consumer is going to 
stop spending on expensive weekends away,' he told clients.
[There's] 'no sign of it yet, but we fear that easyJet will be squeezed as traffic trades down to Ryanair, as easyJet 
prices may not have sufficient incentive relative to the network carriers.'
Webster, in day-to-day charge of easyJet since its establishment a decade ago, is retiring early for personal 
reasons. He will step down as CEO once a successor is found but stay with the airline until November.
OUTLOOK easyJet H1 losses to widen
The announcement of Webster's exit accompanied news that easyJet's founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou is returning to 
the board as a non-executive director, less than three years after he quit the company.
Although Haji-Ioannou's family own 41 pct of easyJet he reiterated his position that he has no current intention to 
take the company private.

LONDON (AFX) - Easyjet PLC put in the worst performance amongst midcaps in early deals as investors used 
benign first-half results as an excuse to cash in profits, dealers said.
At 8.45 am, easyJet dropped 4.8 pct or 12 pence at 236. 
The FTSE 250 meanwhile down 1.6 point at 6,985.4.
The low-cost airline reported a widening of its first half reported pretax loss to 31 mln stg from 27 mln, as it forecast 
unchanged full-year revenue per seat.
Dresdner Kleinworth Wasserstein noted Easyjet's interim margin fell slightly despite a positive Easter effect.
'Overall the H1 figures provide little support for a cost cutting, margin recovery story', it said.
The broker added that following the strong rally, it expects some profit taking.
Dresdner kept its 'hold' rating on the shares and 244 pence price target.
Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch reiterated its 'buy' rating and 280 pence price target, but noted interim results were 
'marginally light'.
It said the group's operating loss was wider than it expected and the consensus.
UBS said easyJet's first half results were 'in-line with expectations', with operating loss 'slightly worse' than forecast, 
but pretax profit 'slightly better'.
The Swiss broker stated it remains cautious in the short term given Ryanair's rapid growth at key bases and the 
sustained high oil price.
Nevertheless, UBS added that a significant turnaround in easyJet's
profitability is 'achievable' in the long term.
It retained its 'neutral' rating and 230 pence target.

BRUSSELS (AFX) - Union leaders have criticised Ryanair Holdings PLC for negotiating salary increases only with 
non-union staff, saying its strategy is tantamount to 'blackmail' to force people to leave unions.
The European Transport Workers' Federation and the International Transport Workers' Federation (ETF, ITF) 
objected after the budget carrier decided yesterday to raise pay by 3 pct backdated to April 1, except to employees 
negotiating through unions.
'Discrimination of workers to collective bargaining because a worker freely chooses to affiliate to a trade union is 
totally unacceptable,' said ETF official Erika Young.
'In this case, it borders almost on blackmail. Inferring that affiliation to a trade union is detrimental to the company's 
profits is extremely misleading, given the success of other unionised low-fares and network carriers.'
According to Ryanair personnel chief Eddie Wilson, the pay increase applies to all staff who participated in the 
direct negotiations with the company. Only Dublin-based pilots did not do so and were therefore left out.
'This pay increase reinforces the strength of Ryanair's model whereby people negotiate directly with the company 
and as a result enjoy better pay and conditions than our low-pay unionised competitors,' he said yesterday.
The ETF and ITF questioned the validity of the direct negotiations. 'Are there real negotiations when Ryanair does 
not recognize trade unions?' it asked.
'It's time Ryanair stopped its anti-union practices, allowed all its workers to freely affiliate to any trade union and 
eliminated discrimination between members of its staff,' said Young.

BRUSSELS (AFX) - Union leaders have criticised Ryanair Holdings PLC for negotiating salary increases only with 
non-union staff, saying its strategy is tantamount to 'blackmail' to force people to leave unions.
The European Transport Workers' Federation and the International Transport Workers' Federation (ETF, ITF) 
objected after the budget carrier decided yesterday to raise pay by 3 pct backdated to April 1, except to employees 
negotiating through unions.
'Discrimination of workers to collective bargaining because a worker freely chooses to affiliate to a trade union is 
totally unacceptable,' said ETF official Erika Young.
'In this case, it borders almost on blackmail. Inferring that affiliation to a trade union is detrimental to the company's 
profits is extremely misleading, given the success of other unionised low-fares and network carriers.'
According to Ryanair personnel chief Eddie Wilson, the pay increase applies to all staff who participated in the 
direct negotiations with the company. Only Dublin-based pilots did not do so and were therefore left out.
'This pay increase reinforces the strength of Ryanair's model whereby people negotiate directly with the company 
and as a result enjoy better pay and conditions than our low-pay unionised competitors,' he said yesterday.
The ETF and ITF questioned the validity of the direct negotiations. 'Are there real negotiations when Ryanair does 
not recognize trade unions?' it asked.
'It's time Ryanair stopped its anti-union practices, allowed all its workers to freely affiliate to any trade union and 
eliminated discrimination between members of its staff,' said Young.

BAA says new Stansted runway has slipped to 2013

LONDON (AFX) - BAA PLC said the completion date for its new runway and terminal at Stansted airport has 
slipped to 2013 at the earliest from an original target date of 2012.
'Because of the complexities and challenges thrown up by road, rail and regional planning, the project has moved at 
a slower pace than originally expected,' said Alastair McDermid, the project director for Generation 2.
'Consequently, we now see 2013 as the earliest completion date and that itself is a challenging target.'
Industry sources indicated that the revised 2013 date may not be met if BAA is forced to pay for the 2 bln stg plus 
project under the Civil Aviation Authority's current 'stand-alone' regulatory framework.
This policy requires that BAA's south east airports -- Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted -- should be run and 
regulated on a stand-alone basis, or in other words financially self-supporting.
BAA has floated the idea that the CAA should abandon 'stand-alone' for the next regulatory period which runs from 
2008 to 2013.
The airport operator wants the CAA to consider allowing the Stansted project to be cross-subsidised by users of its 
other airports in the south east,
effectively reverting to a previous regulatory regime. However, the airlines are overwhelmingly hostile to this.
British Airways PLC, bmi and Virgin Atlantic have previously threatened legal action if BAA attempted to cross-
subsidise.
easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC, which account for nearly 80 pct of Stansted's passengers, oppose the 
concept of cross subsidy and are angry that aeronautical charges at Stansted are increasing in the 2003 to 2008 
regulatory period.
They are also unhappy with some aspects of the Generation 2 proposals, particularly those which cater for long-
haul business the airport does not yet have.
They plan to call on the CAA to force BAA to scale back its plans and 'only build what its customers are prepared to 
pay for.'
BAA says new Stansted runway has slipped to 2013
'It [BAA] is planning to build a folly on the grandest scale that is unnecessary and unwanted,' said Ed Winter, 
easyJet's chief operating officer.
'Before sensible low airport charges attracted the likes of easyJet to Stansted, it was little more than a white 
elephant in an Essex field with a single runway; BAA seems determined to make it a white elephant in an Essex 
field with two runways.'
His comments were echoed by David OBrien, Ryanair's director of operations.
'Ordinary passengers should not be forced to pay higher air fares just to finance another BAA Taj Mahal,' he said.
Meanwhile, BAA also announced that public consultation on its proposed location for the new runway would begin 
in November this year, and that an Environmental Impact Assessment, together with public consultation on the 
airport draft final masterplan would take place in autumn 2006.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) - Delta Air Lines pulled the broader airline sector higher Wednesday after J.P. Morgan 
said bankruptcy would likely have to wait another year.
Shares of Delta surged 9% to $3.28 in early trading while the Amex Airlines jumped 1 point, or 2.3%, to 46.87, with 
every issue moving higher.
Analyst Jamie Baker, in a note to clients, said he believes Delta may have to declare bankruptcy in 2006, but the 
shares have already priced in the likelihood of Chapter 11 in 2005.
'While the market's bankruptcy conclusion may ultimately prove accurate, we believe it is one winter season 
premature,' he said.
Baker upgraded his rating on the stock to overweight from neutral.
AirTran Holdings also moved sharply higher, up 9% at $9.10 while JetBlue Airways added 3.2% to $21.94 and AMR 
Corp. , gained 2% to $11.24.
In other news, Irish low-cost airline Ryanair PLC announced five new routes to Poland and Slovakia from London's 
Stansted airport. 'These five new routes mean British passengers will save over 60 million pounds on the high fares 
of other airlines,' it said.
U.S.-listed shares of Ryanair eked out a small gain to $43.64.

LONDON (AFX) - BAA PLC, operator of seven UK airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, is expected 
to reveal a 15 pct rise in underlying profit when it publishes fourth quarter and full year results today.
For the year to March 31, 2005 analysts are forecasting a profit before taxation and exceptional items of 610-620 
mln stg, with a consensus of 618 mln stg, up from 536 mln stg last time. They have pencilled in a total dividend 
payout of 21 pence, a rise of 5 pct.
The improved performance reflects passenger traffic growth of 6.3 pct, rising income due to the regulatory pricing 
regime and a grip on costs.
The outturn is unlikely to deviate from analyst forecasts given that when BAA published third quarter results at the 
end of January it said it was comfortable with the full year consensus.
'We see no reason why the Q4 numbers should bring any surprises, and the focus should be on progress at 
Heathrow Terminal 5 and potential regulatory developments,' Williams de Broe analyst Stephen Clapham told 
clients.
BAA is expected to say the 4.2 bln stg T5 build is on budget and running ahead of schedule.
Given BAA's recent spat with Ryanair Holdings PLC, Clapham reckons management's comments about customer 
relationships will also be closely scrutinised.
BAA has already flagged that it expects passenger growth to slow to between 3 and 4 pct in the year to end-March 
2006 as it runs up against capacity constraints at Heathrow and tougher prior year comparatives.
April passenger traffic was up 0.8 pct, reflecting the early fall of Easter this year. The underlying increase was 4.2 
pct.

The move follows a round of direct negotiations with staff last month.
The 3 pct award applies to all staff groups across Europe who participated in the direct negotiations.
Consequently, it does not include the Dublin-based pilots.
'The door remains open to this group should they choose to avail of it,' Ryanair said.
The airline claims its employees enjoy better pay than its competitors.

Possible EU green light for Alitalia restructuring plan worries low-cost lobby

BRUSSELS (AFX) - The European Low Fares Airline Association has warned against 'a reversal of the 
commission's firm stance against state aid' following reports that the EU executive is set to approve a restructuring 
plan for Italian airline Alitalia SpA.
The commission could vote on the subject as early as June 1 and the European Low Fares Airline Association is 
worried that the commission might choose to ignore its complaints and others from national operators.
'This is extremely concerning and the approval of these proposals would amount to a clear reversal of the 
commission's firm stance on state aid,' said the European Low Fares Airline Association (ELFAA), a lobby group of 
10 low-cost airlines, in an open letter to the commission.
ELFAA considers the restructuring plan to be 'a blatant infringement of state aid rules' which it says amounts to 3 
bln eur of illegal aid.
The commission opened an in-depth investigation in January of plans submitted by the Italian government. Under 
the proposals, Alitalia will be split into two, the flight operations AZ Fly and ground-handling service provider AZ 
Services.
The EU probe is focusing on a planned 1.2 bln eur recapitalisation of AZ Fly and the public holding Fintecna's 220 
mln eur stake in AZ Services.
ELFAA called the separation of Alitalia 'a blatant attempt to shift over 1.6 bln eur in debt from AZ Fly to AZ Services' 
and called into question the recapitalisation.
The Italian government has to prove that the recapitalisation is being done at market rates and that private investors 
would invest in the company.
ELFAA also objects to help given by the Italian government to the expected 3,679 redundant Alitalia employees 
created by the restructuring.
'An airline operating in the market economy would not have recourse to such support,' said ELFAA.
The leading member of ELFAA, Dublin-based Ryanair Holdings PLC, was subjected to the commission's 'firm 
stance against state aid' last year.
Possible EU green light for Alitalia restructuring plan worries low-cost lobby
The EU ordered the Dublin-based company to repay illegal aid received by the Belgian government at Charleroi 
airport, near Brussels.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary railed against the decision, and initially refused to pay back the aid before 
launching a legal appeal.

PAU, France (AFX) - Aid awarded to low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC by the Pau-Bearn Chamber of 
Commerce for its London to Pau, southwest France, route has been judged illegal by the Pau administrative 
tribunal which has ruled the aid must be cancelled, court sources said.
'The decision which approved financial aid to the benefit of Ryanair without prior notification to the European 
Commission is illegal and should be cancelled,' the tribunal said in its ruling.
Charter airline Air Mediterranee sought a ruling by the tribunal in September 2003 because it believed the aid 
amounted to unfair competition against its own route between London and Tarbes-Lourdes.
The tribunal said in its judgement that the Pau Chamber of Commerce gave Ryanair 80,000 eur to open its London 
Stansted-Pau route in 2003, then 11 eur per Ryanair passenger, up to an annual ceiling of 400,000 eur.
Ryanair also benefited from advantageous landing tariffs, the tribunal said.
The tribunal said the agreement between the Chamber of Commerce and Ryanair must be 'cancelled' or 'rescinded' 
within two months of the ruling, or face a fine of 1,000 eur per day.

Commerce for its London to Pau, southwest France, route has been judged illegal by the Pau administrative 
tribunal which has ruled the aid must be cancelled, court sources said.
'The decision which approved financial aid to the benefit of Ryanair without prior notification to the European 
Commission is illegal and should be cancelled,' the tribunal said in its ruling.
Charter airline Air Mediterranee sought a ruling by the tribunal in September 2003 because it believed the aid 
amounted to unfair competition against its own route between London and Tarbes-Lourdes.
The tribunal said in its judgement that the Pau Chamber of Commerce gave Ryanair 80,000 eur to open its London 
Stansted-Pau route in 2003, then 11 eur per Ryanair passenger, up to an annual ceiling of 400,000 eur.
Ryanair also benefited from advantageous landing tariffs, the tribunal said.
The tribunal said the agreement between the Chamber of Commerce and Ryanair must be 'cancelled' or 'rescinded' 
within two months of the ruling, or face a fine of 1,000 eur per day.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Easyjet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC have both been upgraded to 'buy' from 'hold' at 
Citigroup Smith Barney, dealers said.
In a note to clients on European airlines, Citigroup said it has lowered its earnings forecasts in the sector to reflect 
higher fuel price assumptions.
However, it noted that after 12 pct underperformance over the last year, 'several European airlines are starting to 
look attractive again'.
The US broker added it expects first-quarter results across the sector to be flat despite recent fuel price hikes.
It highlighted 'some good news' in the industry, such as solid business traffic, fuel surcharges, and strong free cash 
flow.
Whereas Citigroup has cut most flag carrier target prices, it has raised low fares airlines' targets.
Easyjet's price target has been upped to 280 pence from 255 pence, and Ryanair's to 6.90 eur from 6.70 eur.
The broker said British Airways PLC and Air France-KLM remain its top picks
among the flag carriers, both rated 'buy'.
BA's target has been retained at 330 pence, while Air France's target has been cut to 15.90 eur from 16.50.
Elsewhere in the sector, Austrian Airlines AG, Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA, Deutsche Lufthansa SA and 
Virgin Express Holdings PLC have been reiterated as 'hold' ratings, with target prices of 7.70 eur, cut from 10.50 
eur, 2.70 eur vs 2.75 eur, 10.90 eur from 12.10 eur. SAS AB had its target raised to 70.00 skr from 60.50 skr.
Alitalia SpA has been maintained at 'sell' at Citigroup with a target cut to 0.10 eur from 0.105 eur.

Portugal mulls setting up airport for low-cost airlines in Lisbon
Portugal mulls setting up airport for low-cost airlines in Lisbon

LISBON (AFX) - Portugal may convert one of four military airports around Lisbon into a civilian airport that would 
cater to low-cost airlines in an effort to boost tourism, Bernardo Trindade, junior minister of tourism, said on Radio 
Renascenca.
'We are looking into a series of infrastructures which are not being used for civilian or commercial purposes and 
which can be given a new use,'
Lisbon's international airport moved 10.7 mln passengers last year making it Portugal's busiest. But many low-cost 
airlines have been reluctant to fly there because of what they say are high landing fees.
During the three-week Euro 2004 football tournament last June, Portugal used three military air bases, including 
one at Figo Maduro near Lisbon, to handle an influx of visitors.
Ryanair Holdings PLC began flying to London from Oporto, Portugal's second-largest city, in Janaury and will open 
a new route from the city to Frankfurt in October.
Last week Oporto airport officials said Ryanair's services led to a 13 pct jump in passenger traffic during the first 
quarter of 2005 from a year earlier.
Portugal's tourism sector employs 10 pct of all workers and generates about eight percent of GPD.

LONDON (AFX) - Britain's newest international airport and the only one outside London big enough to handle the 
mammoth new Airbus A380 has opened for business.
Robin Hood airport, built on the site of a former Royal Air Force bomber base near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, will 
initially offer flights to European destinations, mainly operated by budget carrier Ryanair and charter outfit 
Thomsonfly.com.
Long-haul flights to Florida, Mexico and the Dominican Republic are planned for next year.
'Robin Hood Airport has the potential to be the fastest growing regional airport in the United Kingdom,' said its 
managing director David Ryall.
'We are aiming to become the 'airport of choice' east of the Pennines (the hill range that runs up the centre of 
northern England) for passengers and airlines alike. We hope to achieve that goal within the next five years, if not 
sooner.'

initially offer flights to European destinations, mainly operated by budget carrier Ryanair and charter outfit 
Thomsonfly.com.
Long-haul flights to Florida, Mexico and the Dominican Republic are planned for next year.
'Robin Hood Airport has the potential to be the fastest growing regional airport in the United Kingdom,' said its 
managing director David Ryall.
'We are aiming to become the 'airport of choice' east of the Pennines (the hill range that runs up the centre of 
northern England) for passengers and airlines alike. We hope to achieve that goal within the next five years, if not 
sooner.'

STOCKWATCH Ryanair upgraded to 'add' at ABN Amro on valuation

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has been upgraded to 'add' from 'hold' at ABN Amro, as the stock is at the 
bottom of its current trading range (5.7 eur 6.40 eur), said dealers.
ABN's shares were trading down 0.04 eur at 5.68 at 10.27 am.
ABN pointed out that over the last month, Ryanair's shares have fallen 6 pct, while easyJet PLC's have risen 8 pct. 
Hence, the broker recommends a trading play on Ryanair's stock heading into the full-year results on May 31.
In ABN's view, the current revenue environment is extremely benign for European airlines, both low cost and 
network. However, looking to the second half of the year, ABN sees threats to the network carriers from capacity 
growth by US carriers on the Atlantic, Gulf carriers to Asia and European carriers themselves in the high-growth 
markets of India and China. ABN said it is also concerned that an economic slowdown could weaken the demand 
for premium travel.
By contrast, ABN argued that the factors providing the benign trading environment for the low-cost carriers look 
reasonably likely to be sustained into the second half of the year.
In ABN's view, low-cost carriers are benefiting from the network carrier fuel surcharges and reduced entry of new 
low-cost carriers.

DUBLIN (AFX) - Irish state airline Aer Lingus ended its search to replace Willie Walsh, the outgoing chief executive 
it lost to British Airways last month.
Irishman Dermot Mannion, 47, who has worked for the Dubai-based Emirates airline for the last 18 years, was 
appointed to take the helm from August, Aer Lingus said.
Mannion has been president of group support services with Emirates since 2003, where he was responsible for 
managing Emirates' 25,000-strong workforce in over 80 countries.
Aer Lingus had been without a chief executive since Walsh resigned in January, before replacing BA's boss Rod 
Eddington on March 8.
Walsh had been praised for his role in turning Aer Lingus around and re-positioning it as a low-fare airline and a 
rival to Ireland's no-frills carrier Ryanair.
Along with chief financial officer Brian Dunne and chief operations officer Seamus Kearney, Walsh resigned from 
Aer Lingus when Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern ruled out a proposed buy-out of the airline.
Ahern's government is currently mulling the future of Aer Lingus, which needs funds to develop and, in particular, to 
build up its long-haul operations.
Aer Lingus is 85 percent owned by the government with 15 percent held by the staff.
The airline announced earlier this month a 29-percent rise in 2004 operating profit, as it pressed on with a 
restructuring programme.
The airline said operating profit climbed to 107 million euros (138 million dollars) in 2004 from a year earlier.

LONDON (AFX) - Low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC and airport operator BAA PLC agreed out of court to 
settle a dispute surrounding the scale of fuel levy charges at Stansted Airport.
Ryanair paid BAA an amount it previously withheld because of the dispute with the airport about the rate of the fuel 
levy charge, while BAA withdrew its claims that Ryanair committed a repudiatory breach of its contract at Stansted.
From April 1, BAA reduced its fuel levy charge at Stansted from 0.68 pence per litre to 0.412p a litre in an 
agreement set to last until the next
regulatory review period starts in April 2008.
As a result of this agreement, the fuel levy savings to Ryanair will exceed 1 mln stg a year, the airline said.

MILAN (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC CEO Michael O'Leary said his airline will launch legal action against Italy's 
civil aviation regulator ENAC by the end of the week unless it provides take-off and landing slots for Ryanair's 
planned route from Rome to Alghero in Sardinia.
Speaking in Rome, O'Leary said Ryanair plans to launch the route on April 28, and cited comments by ENAC 
president Vito Riggio, in which Riggio favoured Alitalia SpA regaining a 70 pct Italian market share.
'We have written to ENAC, asking the concession of the slots. Now we are pressing to have a response by the end 
of the week,' O'Leary said.
'There is no explanation for the behaviour of ENAC, which has no right to interfere in competition between Ryanair 
and Alitalia,' he said.
ENAC 'is trying to prevent competition and the lowest tariffs on this route', he said.
ENAC told Ryanair on March 25 it could not operate the Rome-Alghero route, one of three for which it asked for 
slots in January, he said.
Ryanair already has 10,000 bookings on the route, he said, adding he will give the passengers the email address of 
ENAC and the transport ministry so they can ask about the blocked route.
ENAC was not immediately available to comment.
O'Leary said he expects to carry about 10 mln passengers on its Italian operations in 2005.
Asked about a third hub, after Rome's Ciampino airport and Orio al Serio, outside Milan, O'Leary said Ryanair is 
negotiating with three airports on this, including Alghero.

LONDON (AFX) - The FTSE 100 is expected to start the session in positive territory after US markets closed higher 
as oil prices pulled back from record highs, said dealers.
IG Index is indicating a 17-point gain in the FTSE 100 at the open of trade, after the blue chip index closed down 
17.3 points last night at 4,896.7.
US stocks closed in the black as crude prices pulled back from earlier highs and American International Group 
rallied on the possibility that the insurer's troubles could be resolved.
The DJIA closed up 16.84 points at 10,421.14 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 6.26 points to 1,991.07.
Over in Asia, the Nikkei 225 ended the morning up 77.57 points at 11,745.11, while the Hong Kong markets were 
closed for the day.
Meanwhile, oil prices eased further in Asian trading after the OPEC cartel announced it had begun consultations to 
consider raising output by 500,000 barrels per day.
At 5.45 am, New York's main contract, light sweet crude for May delivery dropped 26 cents to 56.75 usd a barrel 
from 57.01 usd in New York overnight where it had finished 26 cents weaker.
Back in London, airlines will be in focus this morning, as both British Airways and Ryanair release traffic figures for 
March. The Times noted that BA said in February that market conditions were broadly unchanged.
The FT also reported today that the global airline industry could lose 2.9 bln stg in 2005 because of continuing high 
crude oil prices, citing a warning buy the International Air Transport Association.
Also today, Whatman will release full-year results. Baird Equities is looking for pretax profits of 16.1 mln stg, up 
from 13.9 mln. A 4.5 pence dividend total, up from 4.3, would be covered by EPS of 15.2 pence against 7.5.
In other headlines this morning, Morgan Stanley announced last night that it will pursue a spin-off of its Discover 
Financial Services unit. The division, which includes the Discover credit card, is among the largest credit-card 
issuers in the US with more than 50 mln card members.
The Times noted this morning that both HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland are among those trying to increase their 
share of the US market.
London shares outlook - higher after solid close on Wall St as oil prices ease
On the broker front, traders said Goldman has reportedly downgraded Allied Domecq to 'in-line' from 'outperform'.
Finally, in economic news, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply gauge of service service sector activity 
is due for release and is expected to dip to 55.0 in March from 55.1 the previous month.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based no-frills airline, said it carried 2.57 mln passengers in 
March, a 20 pct increase on the same month last year.
Load factor -- passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available -- increased 2 percentage points to 80 
pct.
The figures are distorted by the earlier falling of the Easter weekend this year.
The rolling 12-month passenger figure is 27.6 mln, while the load factor is 84 pct.
At 10.17 am shares in Ryanair were up 5 cents at 5.99 eur.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) - Among U.S.-listed shares of European companies, British drug company Elan Corp. saw 
the biggest loss Thursday, plunging 53 percent.
Elan ADRs fell $3.73 to $3.25 after it and partner Biogen Idec reported that an ongoing investigation into the safety 
of its now-withdrawn drug Tysabri has uncovered a second patient death linked to the drug from the extremely rare 
brain disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
The Bank of New York European ADR Index was last down fractionally to 125.77.
A report of rising crude oil futures, with May-dated crude adding 61 cents to $54.60, prompted mixed results in the 
airline sector.
Oil-sensitive airline Air France-KLM was last trading down 1.4 percent to $17.98 as oil prices gained and as the 
airline was downgraded to 'underperform' from 'outperform' by Credit Suisse First Boston, with the price target cut 
to 11.40 euros from 17.70 euros. The broker said quarterly earnings before interest and tax progression is moving 
'in the wrong way' and low margins mean fuel may continue to be a drag on earnings.
Other airlines saw marginal increases. British Airways rose fractionally to $50.24 and lost-cost Irish carrier Ryanair 
increased slightly to $43.71.

dramatically higher oil prices by Goldman Sachs weighed on stocks.

Crude oil prices could top $105 a barrel, according to a Goldman Sachs forecast that says a 'super spike' period of 
is a possibility.

Copenhagen Airports forced back to drawing board on changes to charges

COPENHAGEN (AFX) - Copenhagen Airports AS has been forced to go back to the drawing board over proposed 
changes to its charging structure aimed at attracting no-frills carriers like Ryanair Holdings PLC, according to a 
report in daily Boersen citing airline sources.
The airport operator had been proposing the removal of a discount on the charge for transit passengers in order to 
fund a 15 pct general reduction in charges.
The plan has been vetoed by transport minister Flemming Hansen following protests from SAS AB, which routes 
many Scandinavian passengers to Copenhagen, where they change to overseas destinations.
The airline sends 10 mln passengers a year to or through Copenhagen's Kastrup airport and removing the transit 
passenger discount would have cost SAS about 100 mln dkr a year in extra charges.
Earlier this week, Ryanair was reported as showing renewed interest in adding Copenhagen's Kastrup airport to its 
destination list.
The Irish carrier currently uses Malmoe's Sturup airport for customers in eastern Denmark because of the Swedish 
airport's charges structure.
The discount airlines have complained about the level of charges at Copenhagen, which are the highest in 
Scandinavia, Boersen said.
Copenhagen Airports must now start its negotiations with the airlines again. A new agreement is needed by the end 
of this year, when the existing one expires.

LONDON (AFX) - Air France-KLM has been downgraded to 'underperform' from 'in-line' at Goldman Sachs in a 
report on the European airline sector, dealers said.
In its report, Goldman said its GDP-adjusted supply growth implies airline stocks should fall in absolute terms and 
that yields should keep declining. 
Near term things are better, especially on the long haul, but medium term the broker sees supply growth exceeding 
GDP.
Moreover, Goldman noted fuel surcharges are helping what would otherwise be another poor year for yields and 
the broker has increased estimates across the sector.
On the downside, Goldman pointed out new aircraft are very affordable and ordering is likely to pick up, enticing 
new entrants into the industry.
In terms of winners and losers in the sector, Goldman prefers strong business models centred around defendable 
point-to-point franchises with a high long-haul focus.
BA ia the broker's top pick, while Air France-KLM has been downgraded because it consistently comes out as one 
of the highest growers on short-haul and long-haul. In Goldman's view this is not the right time to be growing, 
especially when there is little being squeezed out of the merger with KLM and minimal cost cutting at Air France 
itself.
Goldman reiterated its 'outperfrom' recommendation on Iberia SA, its 'in-line' ratings on Easyjet PLC and Ryanair 
PLC, and its 'underperform' ratings on Lufthansa AG and SAS AB.

FRANKFURT (AFX) - Vodafone Group PLC is considering launching
'Ryanair-style' cut-price mobile phone packages in mainland Europe for the
estimated 5-15 pct of potential clients seeking no-frills services, said chief
executive Arun Sarin.
The mobile giant is looking to introduce such services in Germany and
several other European countries, Sarin told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
in an interview.
Germany's third largest mobile operator, E-Plus, already plans to start a
no-frills service in the second quarter of this year. Vodafone ranks second in
Germany in market share terms.
Sarin added that, in the coming years, Vodafone plans to grow its business
80 pct through organic means and 20 pct via acquisitions.
The main markets the UK-based operator plans to focus on for growth are
developing ones, notably eastern Europe and Russia, followed by India, China and
South East Asia.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) - Another busy day for Elan coupled with word of a new chief executive at British Airways 
made for a mostly upbeat trading day for U.S.-listed shares of European companies on Tuesday.
The Bank of New York European ADR Index moved up nominally to close at 131.59.
Leading the way, Elan closed up 69 cents, or 10.7 percent, to $7.13 on extremely heavy volume, in another move to 
recoup some of last week's steep losses.
The Irish drugmaker's stock lost more than 70 percent of its value when it and partner Biogen Idec announced they 
were temporarily suspending all sales of their new drug Tysabri over safety concerns.
Weighing on the pharma group, Sanofi-Aventis finished the session down 78 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $41.73.
In the airline sector, shares of British Airways gained 91 cents, or 1.7 percent, to end at $53.88. The company said 
that Willie Walsh, an executive with Ireland's Aer Lingus airline, will become its new chief executive.
Air France - KLM added 1.8 percent to $19.37 and Ryanair was the most active issues, off fractionally at $43.80.
Steelmakers were among the leading decliners, as a group, with Mittal Steel off 3.1 percent at $40.41 and Mechel 
Steel down 2.8 percent at $29.55.

FRANKFURT, March 4 (AFP) - The Irish cut-price airline Ryanair wants to set up a new hub in Germany and is in 
talks with two airports to that end, the carrier's chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a newspaper interview 
published Friday.
'It is highly likely' that Ryanair will open a new base in Germany next year, O'Leary told the Financial Times 
Deutschland in an interview.
Intensive talks were already under way with two airports, he said, without naming them.
Ryanair currently flies from eight German airports but its main base is the Hahn airport in southwestern Germany, 
from where it operates six daily flights.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) - U.S.-listed shares of European companies turned higher Thursday, lifted by strong gains 
among oil and gas giants benefiting from a surge in crude prices.
The Bank of New York European ADR Index logged a fractional advance to close at 129.84. 
The rise in oil shares compensated for weakness among car makers and tepid performance among airlines, which 
are sensitive to oil fluctuations.
DaimlerChrysler was the only European auto company to gain, albeit only nominally, closing at $45.85.
Ducati Motor Holding and Tomkins Plc. both lost less than 1 percent, while Fiat SpA. shed 16 cents, or 2.1 percent, 
to close at $7.61.
Ryanair bucked the oil surge, adding 70 cents, or 1.6 percent to $43.95, while British Airways reversed course to 
close barely in positive territory. Air France - KLM lost 7 cents to end at $18.96.
Oil and gas producers, however, managed a broad-based advance.
Repsol YpF. was the biggest gainer, adding 1.6 percent to an all-time high of $27.74, leading the entire sector 
higher. BP Plc. added 1.2 percent to $65.43, while Eni SpA and Royal Dutch Petroleum took out new 52-week 
highs.
Separately, semiconductor companies took a hit following some bearish comments from Merrill Lynch.
Analyst Andrew Griffin cut his earnings estimates for Germany's Infineon Technologies , which helped send the 
stock down 2.1 percent to $10.17.
ASML Holding fell 2.4 percent to end at $17.97 and ASM International lost 1.7 percent at $18.22.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has been upgraded to 'overweight' from 'neutral' by JP Morgan, mostly on 
the back of the recent Boeing order, dealers said.
In JP Morgan's view, Ryanair is undervalued for the strength of earnings growth, but the broker thinks the Boeing 
deal provides a new level of shareholder value.
A share price below 6.0 eur would offer a good opportunity to accumulate Ryanair's stock, argued JP Moprgan.

LONDON (AFX) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has been fined 24,000 stg for misleading customers about 
the price of flights, according to a report on the BBC.
A jury at Chelmsford Crown Court found that the Dublin-based firm was guilty of six breaches of the Consumer 
Protection Act.
Trading Standards officers, who brought the prosecution, argued that Ryanair had failed to spell out the full cost of 
seats.
Ryanair had denied any offence and said the prices were not misleading.
The allegations related to the cost of flights from London Stansted to various European destinations.
Trading Standards claim the cost of insurance and tax was not included in the initially advertised price on the 
company's Internet website.
Ryanair claimed customers were told the fare did not include tax charges.

Iberia, Lineas Aereas de Espana SA will to post full-year to Dec 31 earnings, with investors expected to focus on 
the company's capacity to control fuel costs and falling unit revenues, analysts said.
    Iberia has seen a recent decline in revenue per passenger, or yields, particularly on its domestic routes, and has 
dedicated much of its efforts to controlling profitability in this segment.
    Espiritu Santo's Joaquin Garcia-Romanillos forecasts a 3.8 pct fall in yields for domestic routes in 2004, with 
medium haul routes seeing a 6.9 pct decline in yield and intercontinental flights seeing a 4.4 pct decline, giving an 
average decline in unit revenue of 6.5 pct.
    He said that rising kerosene costs could offset the positive impact of Iberia's cost control policy, set out in its 
2003-2005 business plan, on the group's fourth quarter EBITDAR (earnings before investment, taxes, depreciation, 
amortisations and rentals).
    Full-year net profit is seen rising to 174-195 mln eur in 2004 from 143.6 in 2003, on EBITDAR of 729-761 mln 
eur, up from 700.7 mln eur.
    Forecasts for sales come in at 4.790-4.793 bln eur, up from 4.619 bln; with EBITDA seen at 316-346 mln eur 
compared to 331 mln eur and EBIT rising to 172-199 mln eur from 160 mln.
    An analyst at a Portuguese bank said that investor attention will be fixed on the group's earnings and business 
outlook with respect to its strategic "Plan Director" for 2005, taking into account greater local competition and its 
positioning in medium and long haul routes, as well as fuel costs.
 Competition from low-cost airlines such as Easyjet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC, has severely affected Iberia's 
performance in routes between Spain and the rest of Europe this year.

STOCKWATCH EADS reverses gains on talk of Lagardere exit, other rumours
STOCKWATCH EADS reverses gains on talk of Lagardere exit, other 
rumours

Shares in European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co (EADS) reversed sharp gains earlier in the session, falling 
victim to discouraging market talk, including a possible exit of shareholder Lagardere, dealers said.
    At 3.51 pm the share was down 0.09 at 23.64 after rising to 24.34 earlier in the session.
    The CAC-40 was up 38.25 at 4,015.92.
    A Paris-based dealer said three factors explain this reversal.
    Firstly, "there are rumours, just rumours for now, that Vivendi wants to acquire Lagardere's media business and 
is buying shares on the market."
    "This would mean Lagardere exiting EADS and that is why both Vivendi, EADS and its potential merger partner 
Thales are under pressure."
    Lagardere holds just over 15 pct of EADS.
    In January, EADS co-CEO Philippe Camus said Lagardere and Vivendi Universal SA were discussing options for 
a tie-up, but said a full merger was "unlikely".
    The second rumour affecting EADS, the dealer said, "concerns the contract EADS is reported (yesterday) to 
have won in the UK (to supply air-to-air tankers to the Royal Air Force), has been renegotiated downwards, 
seriously cutting the group's potential margin."
    Thirdly, "there has been arbitrage in favour of Boeing since it won the Ryanair contract (for 140 new aircraft) 
yesterday."
    Another French dealer said he "recently met three top Lagardere executives" who said they have received "three 
French offers to buy Lagardere's stake in EADS in the event of its exit".
    The share was up earlier today, with dealers citing a report in Spanish daily El Pais claiming Airbus is favourite to 
win a contract to renew Iberia's fleet.
 Lagardere shares were up 0.35 at 59.80, those of Vivendi were down 0.02 at 23.89 and Thales was up 0.03 at 
34.22.

Share prices remained higher midafternoon as investors took heart from a largely encouraging earnings season, 
but a marginally negative opening on Wall Street pulled shares off earlier highs, dealers said.
    At 3.33 pm the the CAC-40 index was up 40.01 at 4017,81, off an earlier high of 4021.09 as some players 
pocketed gains ahead of the weekend.
    On the Matif, February CAC-40 futures were trading up 36 at 4,019.0.
    The euro was at 1.3189 against the dollar compared to 1.32065 late yesterday.
    Dealers said investors put concerns over the weak dollar and high oil prices to one side, focusing instead on the 
"bright side: cheap money and a lot of cheap shares."
    Techs were in demand once again as the ongoing re-rating of the sector drew in more bargain hunters.
    Alcatel was up 0.12 at 10.01 after news Moody's Investors Service placed its debt rating under review for a 
possible upgrade, citing its return to sales growth and the sharp increase in its margin.
    Global Equities said "what shocks us… is that the rating was not removed months ago from the infamy of junk 
status."
    Capgemini was up 0.48 at 28.33, adding to yesterday's gains of 6.8 pct after yesterday's bullish margin guidance 
for 2005 sparked upbeat broker comments, and placed the group back on the bargain-hunter radar.
    JP Morgan, which has an 'overweight' stance on Capgemini, raised its target to 30 eur from 28 and lifted its 
forecast for 2005 EPS to 1.02 eur from 1.01.
 Exane BNP Paribas analysts raised their recommendation to 'outperform' from neutral', and quoted a 32 eur target, 
up from 26 previously.
    Elswhere in the sector, France Telecom was up 0.20 at 23.33 and STMicroelectronics gained 0.17 at 13.55.
    Strong full-year results and upbeat guidance from WPP sent Publicis up 0.52 at 23.25.
    EADS shares reversed gains, losing 0.13 at 23.60, after earlier rising to 23.58.
    A Paris based analyst said three factors explain this reversal.
    Firstly, "there are rumours, just rumours for now, that Vivendi wants to acquire Lagardere's media business and 
is buying shares on the market."
Paris shares up, off highs on shaky open in US
    "This would mean Lagardere exiting EADS and that is why both EADS and it potential merger partner Thales are 
down."
    Secondly, "there are concerns the contract EADS is reported to have won in the UK (to supply air-to-air tankers 
to the Royal Air Force), has been renegotiated downwards, seriously cutting the group's potential margin."
    Thirdly "there has been arbitrage in favour of Boeing since it won the Ryanair contract (for 140 new aircraft) 
yesterday."
    The share was up earlier today, with dealers citing a report in Spanish daily El Pais claiming Airbus is favourite to 
win a contract to renew Iberia's fleet.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has placed an order for a further 140 Boeing 737-800 series aircraft, substantially 
higher than the 50 aircraft order expected in a report in the Wall Street Journal.
    The order comprises of 70 firm aircraft valued at over 4 bln usd and 70 options.
 This agreement brings the total Ryanair/Boeing order book up to 225 firm aircraft and 193 options.
    At the end of 2005, Ryanair will have taken delivery of about 100 new Boeing 737-800's from the original 155 firm 
order and these 70 new firm orders, which are due for delivery primarily between 2008 and 2012 will allow Ryanair 
to maintain its planned double digit growth during the latter years of this decade, the company said.
    Ryanair also said the 70 new aircraft will result in the creation of more than 2,500 new jobs in Ryanair principally 
for pilots, cabin crew and engineering people. Half of these jobs will be generated at the airlines existing 12 
European bases, with the remainder at the 10 or more new bases which will be developed by Ryanair over the next 
seven years.

A big drop in aircraft orders masked growing demand for other U.S.-made durable goods in January, according to 
Commerce Department data released Thursday.
Total orders for durable goods sank 0.9 percent in January as demand for civilian aircraft plunged by 27.1 percent, 
the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
Excluding the 5.3 percent drop in orders for transportation goods, new orders increased 0.8 percent, surprising 
strength given the expiration of a tax break at the end of 2004 that economists suspected would slow investment 
growth in the early months of this year.
Orders in December were revised higher to a 1.4 percent gain from 1.1 percent previously. 
Economists were looking for orders to be unchanged in January, according to a survey conducted by MarketWatch.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said first-time claims for jobless benefits rose 9,000 to 312,000 last 
week, while the four-week average fell to a four-year low of 308,750.
The bond market was largely unchanged following the data.  "Traders overlooked the decline in the headline 
durable orders, noting instead the strength in the major components of the report," said analysts at Action 
Economics.
Durable goods orders are extremely volatile, particularly for big-ticket items such as airplanes. A loss in one month 
can be made up with the stroke of the pen in the next. For instance, Boeing Co.   won a new order for 140 planes 
from Ryanair on Thursday, worth about $4 billion.
New orders are up 10.5 percent since January 2004.
New orders for most categories were up in January, except for computers, cars and airplanes. The orders data do 
not include semiconductors.
Shipments of durable goods rose 1.5 percent in the month after an upwardly revised 2.8 percent increase in 
December. The revision to December shipments should lead to a greater upward revision to fourth-quarter gross 
domestic product on Friday. Economists were already expecting the 3.1 percent estimate to be revised to 3.6 
percent.
Orders for core capital goods increased 2.9 percent in January after a 3.3 percent gain in December.
U.S. Jan. durable orders strong aside from aircraft - UPDATE 2
Shipments of core capital goods - the best monthly measure of business investment - increased 3.7 percent in 
January.
Inventories of durable goods increased 0.9 percent in January, while unfilled orders fell 0.2 percent.
Transportation goods accounted for the decline in new orders. Orders for aircraft sank 27.1 percent in January after 
falling 16.8 percent in December. Motor vehicles fell 3.8 percent after a 4.9 percent rise in December. Defense 
aircraft jumped 56.9 percent after a 39.8 percent decline in December.
Electrical equipment increased a record 13 percent while shipments rose 4.9 percent.
Computers and electronics fell 1.2 percent while shipments increased 4 percent.
Machinery increased 0.3 percent while shipments increased 2.6 percent.
Primary metals increased 1.6 percent while shipments increased 2.3 percent. Orders and shipments for fabricated 
metals increased 1.2 percent.

Orders for core capital goods increased 2.9 percent in January after a 3.3 percent gain in December.
"Durable goods manufacturers should be dancing a jig," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.
"Any fears of a hangover in early 2005 after the expiration of the depreciation tax bonus at the end of last year can 
now be officially put to bed," said Steve Stanley, chief economist for RBS Greenwich.
But another economist warned that weakness in high tech, planes and autos cannot be ignored. "The core not as

- Altria Group, Caterpillar and Exxon Mobil paced a rally in U.S. stocks Thursday as Wall Street continued working 
to recoup big losses from earlier in the week.
"The market had this big sell-off on Tuesday and it gained a little bit of ground -- about 40 percent of it -- back on 
Wednesday, and today it looks like they're trying to claw a little bit more back from Tuesday's weakness," said Tim 
Heekin, head of stock trading at Thomas Weisel Partners.
After hovering around the flat line for most of the session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average   closed at its best 
levels,  up 75 points, or 0.7 percent, at 10,748.79.
Since Tuesday, when the blue-chip gauge tumbled 174 points to suffer its largest one-day slice since May 2003, the 
Dow has now recovered 137 points of that decline.
The Nasdaq Composite Index  , meanwhile, rose 20.45 points, or 1 percent, at 2,051.70 and the S&P 500   added 
9.40 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,200.20.
John Hughes, managing director of Epiphany Equity Research, said the lack of follow-through to the sell-off earlier 
in the week paints a more bullish scenario.
There could be another little push to the upside, "but I don't think spectacularly so. I think, again, you make highs 
that are going to be marginal highs -- it's going to be being in the right groups of the right stocks," he added.
Boeing Co.   was among the blue-chip gainers, rising 2.3 percent after Irish low-cost airline Ryanair 
Holdings   confirmed it placed an order for 140 new 737-800 aircraft worth more than $4 billion.
Other notable Dow advancers included Caterpillar   and Exxon Mobil   and Altria Group  .
American International Group  , General Motors   and Walt Disney   were among the Dow decliners.
In the broader market, advancers outnumbered decliners 23 to 11 on the New York Stock Exchange and 19 to 12 
on the Nasdaq. Big Board volume was about 1.51 billion shares, while some 2.03 billion shares traded on the 
Nasdaq.
Setting the tone for most of the day's trading was volatility in crude prices, as traders assessed conflicting reports 
on the state of U.S. petroleum and product supplies, and as a key OPEC figure said high prices are seen for the 
rest of the year.
Wall Street - U.S. stocks rally, end at session highs - UPDATE 9
"We sort of thought we had gone through that wall for [crude] already, and all of a sudden the last week and a half 
it's crept up again in terms of price and in terms of worry, and I just really think that we thought we were going to be 
over that," said Mark Bryant, senior vice president at Brean Murray.
The Energy Department reported a 600,000-barrel increase in crude inventories, while the American Petroleum 
Institute said supplies fell by 3.4 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 18. Also, the Energy Department reported 
a 1.8 million barrel increase in gasoline supplies and a 700,000 barrel drop in distillate inventories.
April crude seesawed in the $51 to $52 a barrel range before closing up 22 cents at $51.39 on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, after climbing as high as $52.05.
In the latest economic news, the Commerce Department reported that orders for new U.S.-made durable goods 
sank 0.9 percent in January as demand for civilian aircraft plunged. Economists were looking for orders to be 
unchanged in January.
Separately, the Labor Department that first time claims for state unemployment benefits rose 9,000 to 312,000 in 
the latest week. It was the first increase after three straight weekly declines and topped the consensus forecast that 
claims would rise to 308,000.
The dollar was flat against the euro at $1.3201 and up 0.4 percent against the Japanese yen at 105.32.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note closed down 4/32 at 97 24/32 to yield 4.28 percent, up from 4.27 percent at 
Wednesday's close.
Gold futures closed down 40 cents to $435.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Companies providing Web search services were lower, however, amid RBC Capital downgrades of sector leaders 
Google and Yahoo and news that America Online, a unit of Time Warner  , has launched a local search service.
The group was also impacted by a study from PricewaterhouseCoopers that said the growth rate for online 
advertising slowed in the fourth quarter.
Google   shares were off 2.6 percent; Yahoo's   stock lost about 2 percent; and Ask Jeeves   slid 6.4 percent.
FindWhat.com  , which issued a warning for the first quarter after Wednesday's closing bell, plummeted more than 
18 percent.
Meanwhile, retailers continued to weigh in with their latest quarterly numbers.
J.C. Penney Inc.   said fourth-quarter net income from continuing operations rose 40 percent, as same store sales 
for the period rose 3 percent and total sales fell 4 percent. Looking ahead, the department store retailer said it 
expects first-quarter earnings from continuing operations in the range of 48 cents to 53 cents a share. Shares 
slipped 0.1 percent.
Limited Brands  , meanwhile, reported preliminary fourth-quarter earnings and sales that topped year-ago levels, 
saying that it expected to restate its previously filed annual and quarterly results as it reviews its accounting for 
leases. Limited shares fell 1.8 percent.
In other earnings news, Viacom   posted a fourth-quarter loss of $17.1 billion on an $18 billion asset impairment 
charge as revenue climbed 6 percent. Looking ahead, the media company forecast middle single-digit growth in 
revenue and operating income and high single-digit growth in earnings per share for 2005. The stock slid 2.1 
percent.

U.S. stocks picked up steam Thursday afternoon, paced by gains in Caterpillar, Altria and ExxonMobil but Internet

Home Depot  , Walt Disney   and General Motors   were among the Dow decliners.
In the broader market, advancers outnumbered decliners 21 to 12 on the New York Stock Exchange and 17 to 14 
on the Nasdaq. Big Board volume was about 1.1 billion shares, while some 1.6 billion shares traded on the Nasdaq.
Setting the tone for most of the day's trade was volatility in crude prices as traders assessed conflicting reports on 
the state of U.S. petroleum and product supplies, and as a key OPEC figure said high prices are seen for the rest of 
the year.
"We sort of thought we had gone through that wall for [crude] already, and all of a sudden the last week and a half 
it's crept up again in terms of price and in terms of worry, and I just really think that we thought we were going to be 
over that," said Mark Bryant, senior vice-president at Brean Murray.
The Energy Department reported a 600,000-barrel increase in crude inventories, while the American Petroleum 
Institute said supplies fell by 3.4 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 18. Also, the Energy Department reported 
a 1.8 million barrel increase in gasoline supplies and a 700,000 barrel drop in distillate inventories.
Wall Street - U.S. stocks in afternoon advance - UPDATE 6
April crude seesawed in the $51 to $52 a barrel range before closing up 22 cents at $51.39 on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, after climbing as high as $52.05.
In the latest economic news, the Commerce Department reported that orders for new U.S.-made durable goods 
sank 0.9 percent in January as demand for civilian aircraft plunged. Economists were looking for orders to be 
unchanged in January.
Separately, the Labor Department that first time claims for state unemployment benefits rose 9,000 to 312,000 in 
the latest week. It was the first increase after three straight weekly declines and topped the consensus forecast that 
claims would rise to 308,000.
The dollar was flat against the euro at $1.3201 and up 0.4 percent against the Japanese yen at 105.41.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 4/32 at 97 24/32 to yield 4.28 percent.
Gold futures were down 30 cents to $435.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Companies providing Web search services were lower amid RBC Capital downgrades of sector leaders Google and 
Yahoo and news that America Online, a unit of Time Warner  , has launched a local search service.
The group was also impacted by a study from PricewaterhouseCoopers that said the growth rate for online 
advertising slowed in the fourth quarter.
Google   shares were off 2.9 percent; Yahoo's   stock lost about 3.7 percent; and Ask Jeeves   slid 6.4 percent.
FindWhat.com  , which issued a warning for the first quarter after Wednesday's closing bell, plummeted 20 percent.
Meanwhile, retailers continued to weigh in with their latest quarterly numbers.
J.C. Penney Inc.   said fourth-quarter net income from continuing operations rose 40 percent, as same store sales 
for the period rose 3 percent and total sales fell 4 percent. Looking ahead, the department store retailer said it 
expects first-quarter earnings from continuing operations in the range of 48 cents to 53 cents a share. Shares 
added 0.4 percent.
Limited Brands  , meanwhile, reported preliminary fourth-quarter earnings and sales that topped year-ago levels, 
saying that it expected to restate its previously filed annual and quarterly results as it reviews its accounting for 
leases. Limited shares fell 1.4 percent.
In other earnings news, Viacom   posted a fourth-quarter loss of $17.1 billion on an $18 billion asset impairment 
charge as revenue climbed 6 percent. Looking ahead, the media company forecast middle single-digit growth in 
revenue and operating income and high single-digit growth in earnings per share for 2005. The stock slid 1.7 
percent.

U.S. stocks picked up steam Thursday afternoon, paced by gains in Caterpillar, Altria and ExxonMobil but Internet 
stocks remained in the red after broker downgrades of bellwethers Yahoo and Google.
"The market had this big selloff on Tuesday and it gained a little bit of ground -- about 40 percent of it -- back on 
Wednesday and today it looks like they're trying to claw a little bit more back from Tuesday's weakness," said Tim 
Heekin, head of stock trading at Thomas Weisel Partners.
After hovering around the flat line for most of the session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average   was trading at 
session highs heading into the close. The blue chip gauge was last up 78 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,752.
The Nasdaq Composite Index   rose 19 points, or 1 percent, to 2,050 and the S&P 500   added 9 points, or 0.8 
percent, to 1,200.
John Hughes, managing director of Epiphany Equity Research said the lack of follow through to the selloff earlier in 
the week does paint a more bullish scenario where there could be another little push to the upside.
"I don't think spectacularly so. I think, again, you make highs that are going to be marginal highs - it's going to be 
being in the right groups of the right stocks," he said.
Boeing Co.   was among the blue-chip gainers, rising 2.1 percent after Irish low-cost airline Ryanair 
Holdings   confirmed it placed an order for 140 new 737-800 aircraft worth more than $4 billion.
Other notable Dow advancers included Caterpillar   and Exxon Mobil   and Altria Group  .
American International Group   , Walt Disney   and General Motors   were among the Dow decliners.
In the broader market, advancers outnumbered decliners 22 to 11 on the New York Stock Exchange and 19 to 13

U.S. stocks were looking at a cautious start Thursday morning as rising crude-oil prices dampened sentiment on 
Wall Street.
S&P futures were down 1.40 to 1,191.30 while Nasdaq futures dropped 6 to 1,495.50 and Dow futures fell 10 to 
10,676.
The numbers were little changed after the latest release of economic data.
The Labor Department reported that first time claims for state unemployment benefits rose 9,000 to 312,000 in the 
latest week. It was the first increase after three straight weekly declines and topped the consensus forecast that 
claims would rise to 308,000.
Separately, the Commerce Department said orders for new U.S.-made durable goods sank 0.9 percent in January 
as demand for civilian aircraft plunge. Orders in December were revised higher to a 1.4 percent gain from 1.1 
percent previously. Economists were looking for orders to be unchanged in January.
The dollar's standing against other major currencies improved after the data. Earlier, in overseas trade, the dollar 
was pressured by concerns about U.S. Treasury yields. The euro traded at $1.3234, down from $1.3253 before the 
data, while the dollar stood at 104.98 yen, contrasting with 104.84 yen beforehand.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was last 4/32 higher at 98 even. Its yield stood at 4.25 percent.
Crude prices were climbing toward $52 a barrel, undermining the positive sentiment seen Wednesday after a 
better-than-expected reading on consumer inflation.
The benchmark contract was last up 62 cents to $51.79 a barrel.
Gold futures were down 30 cents to $435.80 an ounce.
Companies providing Web search services were lower across the board early Thursday amid RBC Capital 
downgrades of sector leaders Google and Yahoo and news that America Online, a unit of Time Warner  , has 
launched a local search service.
The group is also being affected by a study from PricewaterhouseCoopers that said the online advertising growth

Google   shares were off 5.6 percent to $183.09; Yahoo's   stock lost about 4 percent to $30.80; and Ask

FindWhat.com  , which issued a warning for the first quarter after Wednesday's closing bell, plummeted more than 
22 percent to $10.36.
Blue chip Boeing Co.   was in focus after Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings   confirmed it placed an order for 
140 new 737-800 aircraft worth over $4 billion.
Meanwhile, retailers continued to weigh in with their latest quarterly numbers.
J.C. Penney Company, Inc.   said fourth-quarter net income from continuing operations rose 40 percent as same

U.S. stocks backed off Thursday morning as rising crude-oil prices ahead of the latest reports on supply dampened 
sentiment on Wall Street.
"Until oil starts to back off and we get a decent number in terms of inventories to back oil below $50 the market's 
going to remain on the defensive," said Barry Hyman, equity market strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average   was off 20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,652 while the Nasdaq Composite 
Index   fell 7 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,024 and the S&P 500   slipped 2 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,188.
Crude prices were climbing toward $52 a barrel, undermining the more encouraging outlook on inflation provided by 
a better-than-expected consumer price report on Wednesday.
The benchmark contract was last up 58 cents to $51.75 a barrel, ahead of the latest supply data, which will be 
released around 10:30 a.m. (Eastern).
Also weighing, according to Hyman, was the Commerce Department's report that orders for new U.S.-made durable 
goods sank 0.9 percent in January as demand for civilian aircraft plunged. Economists were looking for orders to be 
unchanged in January.
"Disappointment in durable goods orders, although helpful to the bond market, doesn't give us a feeling that 
economic growth, at least in the near-term, is satisfactory to hold up earnings going forward," Hyman said.
Pacing the Dow decline were shares of Hewlett-Packard  , down 0.8 after technology research firm Gartner Inc. 
said the company was surpassed by IBM   as the top seller of Unix servers in terms of market share. H-P's share of 
the Unix server market fell almost 10 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Gartner.
IBM shares slipped 0.1 percent.
Boeing Co.   was a blue chip gainer, however, rising 0.5 percent after Irish low-cost airline Ryanair 
Holdings   confirmed it placed an order for 140 new 737-800 aircraft worth over $4 billion.
In the latest economic news, the Labor Department reported that first time claims for state unemployment benefits 
rose 9,000 to 312,000 in the latest week. It was the first increase after three straight weekly declines and topped the 
consensus forecast that claims would rise to 308,000.

U.S. stocks shifted gears and climbed into the green Thursday morning as crude-oil prices reversed course after

Ryanair Holdings PLC has started High Court proceedings against the Irish Airline Pilots' Union (IALPA) in 
response to what it described as "an organised campaign of harassment and intimidation" of its pilots by the union.
    The Dublin-based no-frills airline said the campaign is being conducted through a website organised and 
controlled by IALPA officials.
 "This 'REPA' (Ryanair European Pilot Association) website has been a conduit for an organised campaign of 
harassment and intimidation of Ryanair pilots who have considered taking up positions on Ryanairs new 737-800 
series aircraft to be based in Dublin later this year," it said in a statement.
    Ryanair has also formerly complained to the Irish police after the website published "specific threats of criminal 
activities".
    "This certainly isnt the first time that Ryanairs employees have been the victims of intimidation by members of 
trade unions at Dublin Airport, but we intend to make certain as a result of these High Court proceedings that it is 
the last," commented Ryanair director of personnel Eddie Wilson.

(Updates to add EU comments on potential costs for airlines)
     The European Commission said it has adopted two further proposals aimed at strengthening the rights of airline 
passengers.
    The first proposal guarantees disabled people the same access to air travel as any other passenger, while the 
second ensures that all passengers have the right to be informed in advance of the identity of their carrier.
 Asked at a press conference about the extra costs involved for airlines, transport commissioner Jacques Barrot 
said the commission has to be careful not to ask for too much, but added that carriers will if they offered quality 
service.
    To suggestions that low-cost airlines will be particularly hard hit by the proposals, he said they have "an interest 
in avoiding disputes in court" with disgruntled passengers.
    Barrot said, without elaborating, that the commission would look into extending the measures to cover travel by 
coach and ship.
    The commission's latest proposals complement new rights for air passengers which come into force tomorrow.
    Under the new rules, airlines with overbooked flights must seek volunteers to surrender their seats in exchange 
for advantages. Otherwise, passengers who are denied boarding, will receive compensation.
    For flights of less than 1500 km, passengers will receive 250 eur each, for flights up to 2,500 km, airlines must 
pay 400 eur and for all other flights, passengers will receive 600 eur.

Iberia, Lineas Aerias de Espana SA is still "open to the idea" of launching a second brand to compete in low cost 
segments, la Gaceta de los Negocios reported citing managing director Enrique Donaire.
    La Gaceta also cited Donaire as saying that he estimates that Iberia and Ryanair Holdings PLC will be the only 
airlines to post profits in 2005 if the price of crude stays around 44 usd per barrel.
 In October, Iberia announced it was mulling a second brand idea proposed by its pilots' unions as a way of 
avoiding job cuts.
    Unions later rejected the idea as pilots working for the new brand would be subject to different wage scales and 
bargaining arrangements.

EU Commission confirms drafting guidelines on aid to regional airports

(Updates to add more detail on conditions)
     The European Commission confirmed it is currently drafting legally-binding guidelines to regulate state aid to 
regional airports following its battle with low-cost airline Ryanair PLC last year.
    "The Ryanair case was a precedent," said Stefaan de Rynck, spokesman for transport commissioner Jacques 
Barrot.
"Following that, we said we would make rules for all 25 member states so that governments and airport managers 
know what the conditions are if they want to grant state aid."
    Under the new plans, due to be unveiled officially by the commission today, governments would be able to grant 
state aid to cover 30-50 pct of the start-up costs accrued by airlines at regional airports over a maximum of five 
years.
    The guidelines are for airports with fewer than 5 mln passengers a year. State aid to airports with 5-10 mln 
passengers a year will "be monitored with particular care," the commission said.
    Other conditions apply, such as non-discrimination between airlines, and state aid will not be authorised "if there 
is already a competitive high-speed rail link".
    Last February, Ryanair was ordered by the commission to repay approximately 4 mln eur of a total 15 mln in 
state aid given at Charleroi airport in Belgium.
    The guidelines will come into force this summer after consultation with member states, De Rynck said.
    The public funding of airport infrastructure will also be covered by the rules.
    National governments are free to finance new air transport infrastructure, but the commission will monitor to 
ensure it does not favour national airport operators or airlines.

The European Commission plans to impose tight conditions on government subsidies to low-cost airlines that fly 
into small regional airports, but will not entirely ban such payments, the Financial Times reported.
    The proposal, in a Commission working paper, follows last year's decision to demand that Ryanair Holdings PLC 
pay back millions of euros in subsidies it received in return for using Charleroi airport, near Brussels.
    The paper, which is likely to form the basis for legally binding guidelines later in the year, says such aid should be 
given only for airlines flying from regional airports with fewer than 5 mln passengers a year and on routes not 
already served by another carrier or high-speed rail link.

Giuseppe Tesauro, chairman of Italy's antitrust authority, said he suspects that traditional airlines and 'no-frills' 
companies have reached an agreement to share the market.
 "I suspect that there is collusion between traditional and non-traditional (airline) companies. There may be a 
partition of the market, " Tesauro said during a conference.
    Tesauro said there isn't sufficient data to fully analyse the market, but "it is obvious that there are areas of 
collusion."
    He added that the presence of low cost airlines seems to indicate that there is a lot of competition, but "it isn't the 
case".

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europes largest low-cost carrier, has announced a 26 pct decline in third quarter net profits 
to 35 mln eur, as higher maintenance provisions of 4.5 mln eur and unit costs hit profitability.
    Passenger volumes in the quarter grew by 13 pct to 6.9 mln, whilst yields were in line with the same quarter last 
year.
As a result, total revenues rose by 15 pct to 294.4 mln eur.
    Unit costs rose by 26 pct due to the increase in the level of activity and in particular higher fuel and route 
charges.
    During the quarter, maintenance provisions of 4.5 mln eur -- net of tax -- were released to the profit and loss due 
to the earlier than scheduled return of six leased 737-300's.
    As a result, third quarter net profit declined by 26 pct and the profit margin after tax declined by seven percentage 
points to 12 pct.
    Group chief executive Michael OLeary, said the results "were a testimony" to the strength of the Ryanair's lowest 
cost model.
    "Despite the difficult trading conditions, including record fuel prices and intense competition, we still delivered 
strong passenger growth and profits," he said.
    "Despite intense competition, yields were similar to those achieved last year and better than our previous 
guidance of a decline of between 5 pct to 10 pct," he added. "We believe this is due to capacity removals by 
competitors and the continuing impact of multiple fuel surcharges imposed by many of our high fare competitors, 
which have made Ryanairs low fares even more attractive to European consumers," he continued.

(Updating to re-cast and add detail)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC today warned that high fuel prices continue to remain high and will continue to impact 
future guidance.
    "Our fuel hedges expired at the end of October 2004 and we were unhedged during November, however as 
forward prices fell, we restarted our hedging programme for this Winter season," said group chief executive Michael 
O'Leary.
    "We are almost 100 pct hedged at an average of 41 usd per barrel for Brent crude for the fourth quarter and are 
unhedged thereafter," he added.
    Lower than expected fuel prices had a positive impact on the group's third quarter results when fuel costs were 4 
mln eur better than the group's previous guidance.
    "We still expect our fourth quarter fuel costs to be 5 mln eur lower than the previous guidance. We still see value 
in hedging to remove uncertainty from our business and will continue to review our hedging policy as forward 
oil     prices return to more normal levels," O'Leary continued.
    However, he said the board was still cautious on the outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year outturn.
    "Whilst yields and fuel prices are now somewhat better than originally forecast, sterling has weakened 
appreciably and this will have a downward impact on yields," he said.
    "In the fourth quarter of last year we suffered a 22 pct collapse in average fares, however based on current 
booking trends we now expect that current fourth quarter yields might be as much as 5 pct higher," he added.
 The group said advance bookings for the fourth quarter show traffic growth in line with expectations and that yields 
are expected to rise by up to 5 pct in the fourth quarter. However, the group said this upturn is more a reflection of 
the 22 pct decline in the comparable yield last year, slower capacity growth and an earlier Easter, rather than some 
significant current price recovery.
    Earlier toady, Ryanair announced a 26 pct decline in third quarter net profits to 35 mln eur, as higher 
maintenance provisions of 4.5 mln eur and unit costs hit profitability.
    Passenger volumes in the quarter grew by 13 pct to 6.9 mln, whilst yields were in line with the same quarter last 
year. As a result, total revenues rose by 15 pct to 294.4 mln eur.

IATA says 2004 air passenger traffic rose 15.3 pct but losses reach 4.8 bln usd

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said world air passenger traffic staged a "phenomenal" recovery 
in 2004 and grew by 15.3 pct from 2003, but airlines struggled to find profits, the chief industry association said.
    IATA said in a statement that all regions had reported double digit growth, led by the Middle East with 24.8 pct 
passenger growth for 2004 over the previous year.
    However, industry-wide losses reached an estimated 4.8 bln usd with the price of fuel remaining "a critical factor 
for airline profitability," according to the association, which groups 270 major carriers.
    Asia recorded 20.5 pct growth in air passenger traffic in 2004, it added.
    "The traffic recovery in 2004 was phenomenal across all regions," said Giovanni Bisignani, director general of 
IATA.
    Growth in Europe reached 10.1 pct, while air passenger traffic in North America rose 14.8 pct.
    The global growth data exceeded IATA's predictions last month of 11 pct growth for 2004 as a whole.
    "The challenge for 2005 is to turn traffic growth into profitability with improved cost efficiency across the industry's 
value chain," Bisignani said.
    IATA forecast that the industry as a whole could achieve profits of 1.2 bln usd this year, provided oil prices 
average 34 usd a barrel.
    However a barrel of North Sea Brent crude was trading at 43.96 usd in London today.
    Bisignani said his members are trying to cut costs and increase efficiency, and urged other parts of the air 
transport supply chain -- notably air traffic control and airports -- to slash their bills.
 "We ask the same of our partners, many of whom are monopolies," he told a meeting of the Civil Air Navigation 
Services Organization (CANSO), which groups air traffic control operators worldwide, in the Dutch city of 
Maastricht.
    IATA said the bill for air traffic control had increased by 9.4 pct since 1999 to 8 bln usd while airline yields had 
fallen.
    Bisignani charged that the cost efficiency of air navigation firms was "simply not good enough".
IATA says 2004 air passenger traffic rose 15.3 pct but losses reach 4.8 bln usd
    "Our customers demand that we evolve to a low cost industry with simplified business processes. Our partners, 
including navigation service providers and airports, must be a part of that evolution," he added.
    Bisignani reiterated a call for more harmonisation of air traffic control across borders and for airlines to have a 
say in the adoption of new technology.
    Airliners had managed to save 1.1 bln usd in 2004 by negotiating with governments, notably in Iraq, China and 
Mexico, to make flights more direct, reducing the duration of a journey, IATA underlined last month.
    Major carriers have also suggested making electronic tickets the norm instead of traditional paper copies, and 
called for cuts in airport landing and handling fees.
    IATA does not include independent budget airlines such as Easyjet and Ryanair, which have brought stiff low-
fare competition to the industry.

- A decline in crude oil prices on Monday helped push U.S.-listed shares of European airlines and automakers 
higher, with Ryanair topping all advancers.
The Bank of New York European ADR Index ended the trading session up nominally at 123.96.
Ryanair   notched a new 52 week high of $47.42 before closing up $3.73, or 8.7 percent, at $46.83. The low-fare 
Irish airline said its yield declines weren't as steep as expected.
Shares of Air France KLM  , which are sensitive to oil price fluctuations, gained 34 cents, or 1.9 percent, to end at 
$18.21. British Airways   moved up $1.17, or 2.4 percent, to $50.25.
In the auto sector, DaimlerChrysler   added 49 cents to close at $45.51 after the government of Dubai said it bought 
a $1 billion stake in the German-American company, making it the third-largest holder. Kuwait is DaimlerChrysler's 
second-largest shareholder behind Deutsche Bank.
Separately, Fiat shares   jumped almost 4 percent to finish at $8.28. The Italian company's auto division reportedly 
may have reached an agreement with General Motors   over a put option that would force GM to buy struggling Fiat 
Auto.
Among pharmaceutical stocks, German drug giant Bayer saw its shares   surge $1.44, or 4.5 percent, to $33.82 
after the company announced it would spin off its chemicals unit Lanxess.
Irish drugmaker Elan   jumped $1.02, or 3.9 percent, to $26.93 with Novartis  , Sanofi-Aventis   and 
SkyePharma   all logging gains.

Shares on Europe's leading bourses remained mostly higher midday as the Dow is expected to move up on relief 
the elections in Iraq passed off relatively smoothly, dealers said.
    At 12.20 pm, the STOXX 50 was 18.14 points higher at 2821.4 and the STOXX 600 was up 1.79 points at 
256.93.
    Spreadbetting firm IG Index suggested Wall Street will head 15 points higher at the open.
    DaimlerChrysler added 1.51 pct after weekend news that Dubai Holding -- a state investment fund from the 
United Arab Emirates -- has bought a 2 pct stake in the company.
    Telecom Italia -- up 2.48 pct -- said the number of its broadband customers rose to 4.010 mln at the end of 
December, from 3.655 mln at end-September.
    The sector was also lifted by confirmation of plans to merge SBC Communications Inc and AT&T Corp, which 
sparked speculative interest in the sector.
    But analysts were divided on the prospects of any large European deals materializing this year.
    Global Equities dealer Frederic Boissel: "The SBC/AT&T deal sparked buying in the overall European telecoms 
sector as the move rekindled hopes for renewed mergers & acquisitions activity this year."
    There is "a lot of progress to be made in Europe before we see deals of this size," a telecoms analyst at a major 
French broker said.
    Merrill Lynch repeated its 'buy' stance on the group.
    Shares in ProSiebenSAT.1 Media soared 6.74 pct on reports that publishing company Axel Springer Verlag 
wants to take a majority stake in the broadcaster, dealers said.
 Shares in high street retailer Woolworths rose 17.9 pct as private venture capital firm Apax Partners Worldwide 
LLP confirmed weekend press speculation that it is considering a bid for the company.
    Finmeccanica, meanwhile, stormed 3.75 pct higher on news it has won a 1.79 bln usd contract to make 
helicopters for the White House.
    The airline sector was in focus as Ryanair -- up 7.5 pct -- published its third quarter earnings statement. The 
group said lower-than-feared fuels costs boosted its numbers.
Euroshares higher midday on Iraq election relief, Bayer trades ex-Lanxess
    Easyjet added 2.44 pct as Panmure Gordon reportedly lifted its rating to 'hold' from 'sell' after Ryanair's numbers.
    Lufthansa moved up 3 pct as merill Lynch lifted its rating to 'buy' from 'neutral'.
    Shares in Iberia were 2.76 pct higher, lifted by news of its planned 82.5 mln eur sale of Savia.
    The sector was also lifted by falling oil prices. Oil prices fell below 44.16 usd a barrel in London after OPEC 
decided to keep production steady and the elections in Iraq over the weekend went off more smoothly than 
expected, with no attacks on oil facilities
    Meanwhile oil stocks underperformed. Repsol fell 0.15 pct, ENI was up only 0.32 pct. And Shell was up 0.27 pct 
ahead of its earnings later this week with investors hoping for a sharp lift in its dividend.
    Bayer bucked the wider trend -- down 2.81 pct -- as its shares trade ex-Lanxess, the chemicals and polymers unit 
spun off from its German parent.
    Lanxess shares were trading at 14.08 pct, below their issue price of 15.75 eur as JP Morgan and Lehman 
initiated coverage with 13 eur and 6.4 eur price targets respectively.
    And Fortis fell back 0.72 pct following a report in a Dutch newspaper that it, Rabobank and GE Capital are 
interested in buying Dutch investment bank NIB Capital.

Shares on Europe's main bourses are expected to move slightly higher in opening deals as the DJIA closed off lows 
and the weekends' elections in Iraq have been declared a success by the international community, dealer said.
    On Friday, the DJIA ended down 40.20 points  at 10,427.20, but off intra-session lows, allowing the market to 
post its first weekly gain for the year as investors took comfort from a pick up in merger activity.
    The Nasdaq fell 11.32 points, to 2,035.83, also posting a gain on the week.
    Across Asia overnight, the Nikkei 225 index closed up 67.01 points at 11,387.59, while the Hang Seng began its 
afternoon session 91.48 points higher at 13,741.54.     
    Although news Japan's top chip stock Toshiba and consumer group Shiseido have cut their profit forecasts will 
weigh in after hours trade.
    Back in Europe, the airline sector remains in focus as Swiss Air Lines is reportedly planning a new capital hike in 
order to finance the renewal of its ageing fleet of aircraft once the recently announced restructuring measures bear 
fruit.
     Ryanair, Europes largest low-cost carrier, has announced a 26 pct decline in third quarter net profits to 35 mln 
eur as higher maintenance provisions of 4.5 mln eur and unit costs hit profitability.
    Passenger volumes in the quarter grew by 13 pct to 6.9 mln, whilst yields were in line with the same quarter last 
year. As a result, total revenues rose by 15 pct to 294.4 mln eur.
  And Euronext will be in focus as the pan-European stock exchange faces strong pressure from the French 
Government to abandon the takeover battle for the London Stock Exchange, The Financial Mail On Sunday 
reported.
    Consumer goods group Unilever is to go through a radical shake-up, reforming the dual Anglo-Dutch structure 
and creating a single company, the Independent on Sunday reported.
    The overhaul will be announced on Feb 10 alongside its full-year figures, and will be flagged as putting Unilever 
in a better position to compete with the new Procter & Gamble/Gillette titan, the paper added.
    On Friday,  Belgian property group Cofinimmo posted a rise in full-year earnings per share before exceptionals to 
8.35 eur from 8.31 eur a year earlier, which beat the company's own guidance.
Euroshares outlook - slightly up on Iraqi election relief
    The result beats analysts' expectations, as polled by AFX News, which were pre-exceptional net earnings per 
share of 7.89-8.11 eur.
    Finmeccanica may be boosted by news it has won a 1.79 bln usd contract to make helicopters for the White 
House
    And oil group ENI may wins some interest as Borsa & Finanza reports CEO Vittorio Mincato may step down in 
May.

Shares on Europe's main bourses opened higher as the DJIA closed off lows, the price of oil fell and amid 
widespread relief the elections in Iraq passed off relatively smoothly, dealers said.
    At 08.50, the STOXX 50 was 19.36 points higher at 2822.62 and the STOXX 600
was up 1.6 points at 256.74.
    DaimlerChrysler added 1.68 pct after weekend news that Dubai Holding -- a state investment fund from the 
United Arab Emirates -- has bought a 2 pct stake in the company.
    Fortis rose 0.43 pct following a report in a Dutch newspaper that it, Rabobank and GE Capital are interested in 
buying Dutch investment bank NIB Capital.
    Telecom Italia -- up 1.56 pct -- said the number of its broadband customers rose to 4.010 mln at the end of 
December, from 3.655 mln at end-September.
    And Finmeccanica stormed 3.47 pct higher on news it has won a 1.79 bln usd contract to make helicopters for 
the White House.
    The airline sector was in focus as Ryanair published its third quarter earnings statement. The group said lower-
than-feared fuels costs boosted its numbers.
    Merrill Lynch repeated its 'buy' stance on the group.
    Easyjet added 4.76 pct as Panmure Gordon reportedly lifted its rating to 'hold' from 'sell' after Ryanair's numbers.
    Lufthansa moved up 2.42 pct as merill Lynch lifted its rating to 'buy' from 'neutral'.
    The sector was also lifted by falling oil prices. Oil prices fell below 47 usd a barrel in Asian trading hours after 
OPEC decided to keep production steady and the elections in Iraq over the weekend went off more smoothly than 
expected, with no attacks on oil facilities
    Meanwhile oil stocks underperformed.
Repsol fell 0.05 pct, ENI was up only 0.16 pct. But Shell was up 0.33 pct ahead of its earnings later this week with 
investors hoping for a sharp lift in its dividend.
    Bayer bucked the wider trend -- down 2.65 pct -- as its shares trade ex Lanxess, the chemicals and polymers unit 
spun off from its German parent.
Euroshares up at open on Iraq election relief, Bayer trades ex-Lanxess - UPDATE
    Lanxess shares were expected to trade at between 11 and 15 eur per shares.

Leading shares opened higher this morning, lifted by relief at the conduct of the weekend's Iraqi elections, while 
earnings optimism at the start of what should be a busy week on both sides of the Atlantic also provided support, 
dealers said.
    By 08.15 am, the FTSE 100 index was up 27.5 points at a 31-month high of 4,860.3, while the broader indices 
were also firmer.
    US stocks closed slightly lower on Wall Street on Friday, but off their worst levels for the session, as investors 
took comfort from a pick up in merger activity.
    Procter & Gamble's 57 bln usd acquisition of Gillette and talk of SBC Communications buying AT&T offset 
persistent concern about lacklustre earnings outlooks and caution ahead of the weekend's Iraq elections. SBC 
today confirmed that it is buying AT&T for 16 bln usd.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 40.20 points at 10,427.20 on Friday, while the Nasdaq 
Composite Index fell 11.32 points to 2,035.83.
    Looking ahead, US investors are girding themselves for a dizzying week that will include an OPEC gathering, a 
Federal Reserve meeting, a State of the Union Address, a fresh slew of earnings reports, the January jobs report 
and a G-7 meeting.
    Across Asia overnight, the Nikkei 225 index closed up 67.01 points at 11,387.59, while the Hang Seng began its 
afternoon session 91.48 points higher at 13,741.54.
    The reporting season gets into full swing in the UK this week with numbers due from a raft of blue-chips including 
Amvescap, Shell, BP, BSkyB, British Airways, Rio Tinto and Smith & Nephew.
 A couple of earnings reports provided some early excitement today.
    Friends Provident shares added 2 pence to 161-1/2 after announcing that life and pension sales for the 2004 
calendar year came in at 434 mln stg on an Annual Premium Equivalent basis, up from 429 mln stg the previous 
year, and at the lower end of market expectations.
    Amvescap was another early riser, up 8-3/4 pence to 337-1/2 as Citigroup Smith Barney upgraded its rating to 
'buy' from 'hold' ahead of the asset manager's fourth-quarter results tomorrow.
London shares open higher as Iraq election relief provides early boost
    BSkyB was also up on earnings hopes, as the weekend press speculated that the satellite broadcaster will 
surprise on the upside when it releases its interim results on Wednesday.
    Ryanair shares were also in demand, up 0.61 eur at 6.48 after the Dublin-based no-frills carrier published a 
better-than-expected third-quarter net profit of 35 mln eur against 47.5 mln eur in the same period last year, while 
passenger volumes rose 13 pct to 6.9 mln.
    Merrill Lynch reiterated its 'buy' recommendation.
    Marconi also made headway after confirming press reports of a strategic tie-up with Chinese group Huawei.
    On the economic front, the GfK UK consumer confidence survey for January should provide some excitement, 
although the highlight of the week looks like being Wednesday's FOMC meeting, with the Federal Reserve seen 
likely to raise US rates by another quarter of a percentage point.

Leading shares are expected to open higher this morning, lifted by continuing consolidation hopes and earnings 
optimism at the start of what looks like being a busy week on both sides of the Atlantic, while relief at the conduct of 
the weekend's Iraqi elections should also provide support, dealers said.
    According to spread-betting firm IG Index, the FTSE 100 index is seen opening around 23 points higher at 4,863 
after closing at 4,832.80 on Friday afternoon.

    Ryanair shares should be active in early deals after the Dublin-based no-frills carrier published a better-than-
expected third-quarter net profit of 35 mln eur against 47.5 mln eur in the same period last year, while passenger 
volumes rose 13 pct to 6.9 mln.
    Friends Provident's fourth-quarter sales figures should also be of interest, while among smaller companies, 
interims are due from Filtronic and Honeycombe Leisure.
    Aside from earnings news, investors look like turning to the weekend press for inspiration.
London shares outlook - higher on relief at high turnout at Iraqi elections
    Unilever looks like remaining in focus today after yesterday's Independent on Sunday reported that the consumer 
goods group is to go through a radical shake-up following the P&G and Gillette merger news, reforming the dual 
Anglo-Dutch structure and creating a single company.
    BAE Systems should also be active after the same newspaper noted that the group has hoisted a for sale notice 
over its 300 mln stg aircraft business, which supplies parts for the Airbus A380 super jumbo.
    Jarvis could move higher this morning after today's FT reports that the group has secured refinancing on all 14 of 
its private finance initiative construction contracts and a one-year extension to its banking facilities.
    Marconi should also make headway after the Sunday Times reported that the telecom equipment group is set to 
announce a strategic tie-up with Huawei. The deal, which is likely to be unveiled tomorrow, will enable the British 
group to sell its products in China.
    On the economic front, the GfK UK consumer confidence survey for January should provide some excitement,

Trading across UK markets was bullish midmorning, lifted by encouraging geopolitical and corporate news, while 
increased M&A activity boosted the shares of Amvescap and Woolworths, dealers said.
    By 10.00 am, the FTSE 100 index was up 36.0 points, while the broader indices were also in positive territory.
    Volume was average, with 511.7 mln shares changing hands in 42,435 deals.
    Over on Wall Street, where stocks closed slightly lower on Friday, indices are expected to open around 38 points 
higher today from a close at 10,427.20, according to spreadbetting firm IG Index, on relief after the conduct of the 
weekend's Iraqi elections.
    Looking ahead, US investors are bracing themselves for a busy week that will include an OPEC gathering, a 
Federal Reserve meeting, a State of the Union Address, a fresh slew of earnings reports, as well as the January 
jobs report and a G-7 meeting.
     On the UK economic front, the GfK UK consumer confidence survey for January should provide some 
excitement, although the highlight of the week looks like being Wednesday's FOMC meeting, with the Federal 
Reserve seen likely to raise US rates by another quarter of a percentage point.
    In London, Amvescap put in the best performance amongst blue chips, soaring above 4 pct on optimism ahead 
of tomorrow's fourth quarter numbers, while lingering bid speculation and an upgrade by Citigroup Smith Barney 
also provided a boost.
    Citigroup Smith Barney raised its rating on the asset manager to 'buy' from 'hold', arguing that bid speculation, 
restructuring potential, management change, and the settlement of market timing investigation are all potential 
catalysts for a re-rating.
 Elsewhere on the upside, shares in the airline sector rose following better-than-expected third-quarter numbers by 
Ryanair and an overnight fall in oil prices.
    Oil prices fell below 47 usd a barrel in Asian trading after OPEC decided to keep production steady and the 
elections in Iraq over the weekend went off more smoothly than expected, with no attacks on oil facilities.
    Blue chip airline peer British Airways 8-1/2 pence higher at 268-1/4, while second-liner easyJet added 9-3/4 
pence at 225, further lifted by a Panmure Gordon upgrade to 'hold' from 'sell'.
London shares extend gains midmorning amid increased M&A activity, upbeat news
    Meanwhile, consumer goods companies remained in play as investors  speculated that the industry would have 
to consolidate quickly in order to compete with P&G/Gillette.
    Cadbury Schweppes added 7-3/4 pence to 482, Unilever was 6-1/4 pence to 505-1/2 and Reckitt Benckiser 
moved 15 pence higher to 1597.
    On a more subdued note, Friends Provident underperformed after the insurer released a disappointing set of 
2004 business figures.
    The insurer announced that life and pension sales for the 2004 calendar year came in at 434 mln stg on an 
Annual Premium Equivalent basis, up from 429 mln stg the previous year, and at the lower end of market 
expectations.
    Merrill Lynch kept its 'neutral' rating on the stock unchanged, while UBS reiterated at 'hold' and Cazenove at 'in-
line'.
    Friends Provident shares were unchanged at 159-1/2.
    Still amongst blue chip fallers, Tate & Lyle lost 1-3/4 pence at 443-1/4 after Lehman Brothers initiated coverage 
of the stock with an 'equal-weight' rating.
    The broker argued that now that the update on the sweetener pricing rounds has been released, there are few 
catalysts for the stock for the next six months, barring exceptional swings in net raw material costs.
    On the second line, all eyes were on Woolworths, which soared above 24 pct, or 9-3/4 pence at 50-1/4, as 
private venture capital firm Apax Partners Worldwide LLP confirmed weekend press speculation that it is 
considering a bid for the company.
    Takeover speculation also sent shares in Manchester United higher, up 11 pence to 260, amid reports that US 
tycoon Malcolm Glazer is preparing to launch another takeover bid for the football club.
    And Marconi also featured amongst the top midcap risers, after confirming press reports of a strategic tie-up with 
Chinese group Huawei, the largest telecom vendor in China's telecom market
    The shares in Marconi added 36 pence to 631-1/2.
    On the downside, building materials and housebuilding stocks came under pressure after UBS downgraded 
ratings across the two sectors on valuation grounds.     
    Carillion fell 7 pence to 240 and Travis Perkins dropped 21 pence to 1907 after UBS downgraded the shares to 
'neutral' from 'buy', while the same move by UBS also weighed on Bellway and Bovis Homes, down 12-1/2 to 851-
1/2 and 7 pence to 615, respectively.

The FTSE 100 continued to trade sharply higher at noon,  jumping to 31-month highs, as investors took heart from 
a high turnout at Iraqi elections over the weekend, sending oil prices lower, while a bout of M&A activity provided 
some excitement, dealers said.
    By 12.10 pm, the FTSE 100 index was up 32.6 points at 4,865.4, though off earlier highs, with the broader 
indices also in positive ground.
    Volume was strong, with 1.011 bln shares changing hands in 89,675 deals.
    Over on Wall Street, Finspreads are calling the Dow around 45-50 points higher as relief buying is expected to 
take place following the weekend's elections in Iraq.
    However, US investors are bracing themselves for a busy week that will include an OPEC meeting, a Federal 
Reserve meeting, a State of the Union Address, a fresh slew of earnings reports, as well as the January jobs report 
and a G-7 meeting.
    Meanwhile on the UK economic front, consumer confidence hit its highest level since November 2002, just prior 
to the Iraq war, according to a survey by research company GfK Martin Hamblin for January.
    GfK's headline consumer confidence index jumped by four points to +1 in January from -3 in December, well 
above analysts' expectations.
    However, this was offset by news of dismal January UK retail sales, with volume of sales slumping to lows not 
seen since 1999, according to a key survey of the Confederation of British Industry.
    In London, increased M&A activity provided most of the direction to trading.
 Amvescap shares jumped over 5 pct of their value, on optimism ahead of tomorrow's fourth quarter numbers, while 
lingering bid speculation and an upgrade by Citigroup Smith Barney also provided a boost.
    Citigroup Smith Barney raised its rating on the asset manager to 'buy' from 'hold', arguing that bid speculation, 
restructuring potential, management change, and the settlement of market timing investigation are all potential 
catalysts for a re-rating.
    Amvescap shares rose 18-1/4 pence at 347.
London shares sharply higher midday on M&A hopes, Iraq relief; Wall St seen up
    Telecom groups also rose as news of the merger of SBC Communications and AT&T rekindled hopes for 
renewed mergers & acquisitions activity this year.
    Both European operators and equipment makers gained on the back of the deal, with BT Group 4-1/4 pence 
higher at 208-1/2.
    Meanwhile, consumer goods companies remained in play as investors  speculated that the industry would have 
to consolidate quickly in order to compete with P&G/Gillette.
    Cadbury Schweppes was 8-3/4 pence to 483, Unilever added 9-1/4 pence to 508-1/2 and Reckitt Benckiser 
moved 17 pence higher to 1599.
    Elsewhere, shares in the airline sector held on to sharp gains following better-than-expected third quarter 
numbers by Ryanair and an overnight fall in oil prices.
    Blue chip airline British Airways was 87-1/2 pence better at 267-1/4 at noon, while its smaller peer easyJet added 
8-3/4 pence at 224, further lifted by a Panmure Gordon upgrade to 'hold' from 'sell'.
    Amongst blue chip fallers, British Land was the worst performer, losing 30 pence at 1,376 following an article in 
the Saturday's Times saying that the group had lost out on the Wood Wharf development in Canary Wharf.
    Meanwhile, Friends Provident fell on the back of a disappointing set of 2004 business figures.
    The insurer announced that life and pension sales for the 2004 calendar year came in at 434 mln stg on an 
Annual Premium Equivalent basis, up from 429 mln stg the previous year, and at the lower end of market 
expectations.
    Merrill Lynch kept its 'neutral' rating on the stock unchanged, while UBS reiterated at 'hold' and Cazenove at 'in-
line'.
    Friends Provident shares were 1/4 pence lower at 159-1/4.
    And Tate & Lyle extended losses, with the shares down 2-3/4 pence at 442-1/4 after Lehman Brothers initiated 
coverage of the stock with an 'equal-weight' rating.
    The broker argued that now that the update on the sweetener pricing rounds has been released, there are few 
catalysts for the stock for the next six months, barring exceptional swings in net raw material costs.
    On the second line, Woolworths remained under scrutiny after private venture capital firm Apax Partners 
Worldwide LLP confirmed weekend press speculation that it is considering a bid for the company.
    Woolworths shares were off earlier highs, though, but still 7-1/4 pence higher, or 17.90 pct, at 47-3/4.
    Takeover speculation also boosted the shares Manchester United, up 16 pence to 270 on reports that US tycoon 
Malcolm Glazer is preparing to launch another takeover bid for the football club.
    Meanwhile, BBA featured amongst top risers, up 33-1/4 pence at 325-3/4 amid vague rumours of a break-up of 
the group.
    Separately, Marconi rose as brokers welcomed news that the group has reached an agreement with Huawei 
Technologies, the largest telecom vendor in China.
    UBS maintained its 'buy' recommendation, arguing this is an exciting new development that will help broaden 
Marconi's product offering and provide a new route into the domestic Chinese telecoms market, while Cazenove 
was also positive and maintained its 'outperform' recommendation.
    Marconi shares were up 46 pence at 641 at lunch time.
    On the downside, building materials and housebuilding stocks continued to head the fallers' board after UBS 
downgraded ratings across the two sectors on valuation grounds.     
    Carillion fell 6 pence to 241 and Travis Perkins dropped 21 pence to 1907 after UBS downgraded the shares to 
'neutral' from 'buy', while the same move by UBS also weighed on Bellway and Bovis Homes, down 12-1/2 to 851-
1/2 and 7 pence to 615, respectively.
London shares sharply higher midday on M&A hopes, Iraq relief; Wall St seen up
    Finally, Brit Insurance fell after Panmure Gordon downgraded its rating on the stock to 'sell' from 'hold', arguing 
that the true profitability of business written in 2004 will emerge in 2005, 2006 and beyond, and could show, in its 
view, that growth "has been at the expense of profitability".
    Brit Insurance shed 1-1/12 pence at 80-3/4.

ROUNDUP BAA set to hit passenger growth targets
ROUNDUP BAA set to hit passenger growth targets
AFX.COM
January 28, 2005 Friday

-- by Rob Branch --
    (Incorporates earlier stockwatch, adds detail on utility bill, terminal 5)
     Shares in BAA PLC hit a two-and-a-half-year high after Britain's largest airport operator posted a big rise in third 
quarter profit and stuck by its passenger traffic growth forecast for the current fiscal year.
    The owner of seven UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted said growth in the number of 
passengers flowing through its terminals slowed to 4.3 pct in the latest three months when compared with the year 
before.
    Though that was down from 5.7 pct growth in the previous three months, and well shy of the first quarter's 9.7 pct 
growth rate, it was sufficient to enable the company to reiterate a prior forecast.
    "The business has continued to make good progress… We are on track to deliver our passenger forecast of over 
6 pct growth for the (fiscal) year," chief executive Mike Clasper said in a statement.
    Passenger growth was boosted at the start of the current fiscal year in comparison with the previous summer 
when long-distance travel dwindled owing to the war in Iraq and the Asian SARS epidemic.
    The recovery in long-haul demand has coincided with a continuation of the meteoric rise in the number of 
passengers flying with no frills carriers such as Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyjet PLC.
    But chief financial officer Margaret Ewing conceded that passenger growth in the fiscal year was likely to be 
towards the lower end of the 6.0-6.9 pct range forecast by analysts prior to today's figures.
 She went on to indicate growth was likely to slow to between 3 to 4 pct in the year to March 2006 as BAA runs up 
against capacity constraints at its biggest airport, Heathrow, and tougher prior year comparatives.
    Ewing said a more precise forecast would be issued at the end of April.
    Pretax profit leapt 13 pct to 146 mln stg in the three months to Dec 31, buoyed by an exceptional profit of 12 mln 
stg on the sale of BBA's Jurys Inn Hotel at Heathrow.
    Operating profit rose 5.4 pct to 157 mln stg on revenue up 5.9 pct to 587 mln.
    The figures were welcomed by financial analysts.
ROUNDUP BAA set to hit passenger growth targets
    "These are encouraging results, although we would not expect full-year consensus forecasts to change on the 
back of these," said UBS analyst Tim Marshall.
    Marshall has a 'neutral' rating on the stock and a 650 pence price target, both of which he left unchanged.
    Fellow broker Citigroup Smith Barney, which described the figures as "solid but low key", expects the shares to 
consolidate recent gains relative to the UK market.
    By 11:15 am, BAA shares were trading 2 pence higher at 617, their highest level since June 2002, valuing the 
company at around 6.6 bln stg.
    BAA shares have risen 22 pct over the past year, outperforming the benchmark FTSE 100 index by around 12.5 
pct in that time.    
    With profit before tax and exceptional items rising 16.8 pct to 515 mln stg in the first nine months, Ewing said she 
is "comfortable" with analysts' forecast for full-year profit of around 619 mln stg.
    BAA said its retail business had delivered "solid results" in what it termed "adverse market conditions".
    Net retail income per passenger grew 0.9 pct to 4.41 stg in the latest quarter and by 1.2 pct to 4.15 stg for the 
nine months.
    But the company said rising energy prices would lift its utility bill by 5-6 mln stg to 78-79 mln in the current fiscal 
and by a further 10 mln in 2005/06.
    BAA, which is building a fifth terminal at London's Heathrow, said the 4.2 bln stg project was on budget.
    With more than 50 pct of the work completed, the terminal is expected to be up and running before the 2008 start 
date originally targeted.

Body
Singapore's budget carrier Tiger Airways is planning to announce several new destinations next week as it reviews 
its business model, the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) reported.
    The Sydney-based aviation industry consultancy said December's tsunami has forced a rethink of the newly 
established low cost carriers expansion plans, as Phuket is one of three destinations Tiger serves.
 It said Tiger Airways, 49 pct-owned by Singapore Airlines, has been granted
rights by the Singapore government to fly to Jakarta, Medan and Padang in Indonesia and is also considering 
destinations in Malaysia, home of rival AirAsia.
    CAPA said the carrier now expects to break even within its first year, having originally forecast a profit in its first 
year of operations.
    The revised expectation follows rising fuel costs and the impact of the tsunami.
    Apart from Singapore Airlines, the other shareholders of Tiger Airways are the founders of Ryanair, Singapore 
investment agency Temasek Holdings and American investors Indigo Partners.
    Meanwhile, CAPA said AirAsia has indicated it plans to establish new international joint ventures, but not in 2005, 
as the carrier consolidates its new Thai and Indonesian ventures.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is cancelling frequencies on three routes out of Milan Bergamo due to a contractual 
disagreement with the airport.
    Michael Cawley, deputy chief executive of the low-cost airline, said the agreement with the airport included an 
expansion of the term of the carrier's contract in return for a 60 pct increase in its presence at the airport and an 
increase in passenger numbers through the airport of over 1 mln a year.
 "Unfortunately the airport feels that it cannot now honour one term of the agreement and regrettably we have 
decided to cancel part of our expansion," he said.
    The routes affected are from Milan to London Stansted, Brussels Charleroi and Frankfurt Hahn, and the cuts will 
take effect from Feb 25.
    The low-cost airline said it will not be expanding its base at Bergamo to a fifth aircraft as originally announced in 
November.
    "Ryanair will be announcing within the next week where this aircraft will now be positioned. All our growth and 
cost projections for fiscal 2005/2006 remain unaffected," said Cawley.

Air France - KLM   ,which has a partnership with Delta Airlines  , fell 1.4 percent, while British Airways    lost 1.3

are a growing threat in Europe, too.

Among technology shares, electronic and electric equipment companies were mixed, while fixed-line telecoms,

Ryanair appeal over wheelchair user dismissed by UK Court of Appeal UPDATE
Ryanair appeal over wheelchair user dismissed by UK Court of Appeal 
UPDATE

Body
(Updates with more detail on Court of Appeal ruling)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC has lost its Appeal Court bid to overturn a landmark ruling that it discriminated against a 
disabled traveller by
refusing to provide him with a free wheelchair at Stansted Airport.
    But the no-frills airline won a partial victory because the Court of Appeal also ruled that BAA PLC, the operator of 
Stansted, was equally to blame and must share the cost of the damages won by Robert Ross, a community worker 
from Islington, North London, who was born with cerebral palsy and suffers from arthritis.
    He regularly travels from Stansted to Perpignan in France and after getting a cheap 10 stg flight objected to 
being charged 18 stg for the use of a wheelchair because he was unable to walk.
    In January, Ross, backed by the British Disability Rights Commission, won a total of 1,336 stg compensation 
from Ryanair -- 36 stg to cover the costs of the wheelchairs he hired, 300 stg to pay for a new wheelchair and 1,000 
stg for injury to his feelings.
    But at the Court of Appeal Lords Justices Brooke, Jonathan Parker and Keene
found that while Ryanair failed to provide free assistance to reduced mobility passengers, Stansted Airport did not 
take sufficient steps to ensure its provision.
    They ruled that under the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act both Ryanair and BAA had discriminated against 
Ross.
    Brooke said Ross "was entitled to enjoy the service at Stansted airside at no cost, as did those who did not have 
his particular disability."
 He said there was no suggestion that it was not reasonably practicable for Ryanair or BAA "to provide a wheelchair 
without cost given their financial resources."
    It followed that both were 100 pct liable to Ross and as both had unlawfully discriminated against him they should 
each pay half of his damages and interest.
    "I felt all along that disabled travellers should not be charged extra just because they are disabled," said Ross.
Ryanair appeal over wheelchair user dismissed by UK Court of Appeal UPDATE
    "I am pleased for myself, for the BDRC which backed me and pleased for all disabled travellers generally."
    Ryanair said it is "disappointed" the Court of Appeal did not establish that BAA was 100 pct responsible for 
wheelchair access.
    The no-frills airline plans to reduce its wheelchair levy by 50 pct, but said it will continue its campaign to persuade 
BAA to provide a free of charge wheelchair assistance service to the disabled. It did not rule out an appeal to the 
House of Lords.
    Ryanair also criticised the judgement for not making clear how the Disability Discrimination Act is to be applied in 
the future.
    "Take for example a church hall -- an example used at the hearing. If a church hires out a hall for a party, who is 
responsible for the welfare of a disabled guest? The church or the organising party."
    BAA said it believed it was properly fulfilling its responsibilities
under current legislation and apologised to Ross for not doing more to prevent the discrimination he suffered.
    It plans to take steps to ensure airlines, including Ryanair, treat passengers with reduced mobility equally with all 
other customers.
    Meanwhile, the BDRC wants Ryanair to pay compensation to a further 35 disabled passengers who have 
complained about being charged for the use of wheelchairs.
    At 11.29 am shares in Ryanair were unchanged at 5.25 eur, while shares in BAA were up 2-1/2 pence at 574.

(Updating to add more detail from BAA statement)
     BAA PLC's passenger growth slowed to 3.0 pct in November, but the operator of seven UK airports, including 
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, reiterated guidance for the year to end-March 2005 of traffic growth of "over 6 
pct".
    In November the group handled 10.2 mln passengers.
 The 3.0 pct growth was down from 5.2 pct in October and 7.5 pct in the six months to end-September.
    The shortfall reflected growth of just 1.2 pct at Heathrow where traffic was suppressed by the US Presidential 
election and Thanksgiving and more generally by fuel surcharges and the reduction in British Airways's schedule.
    Gatwick's traffic increased 4.6 pct, reflecting growth in scheduled markets which offset a significant decline in 
charter traffic.
    Stansted's 4.2 pct growth was also slower than in previous months.
    BAA noted that while EasyJet and other airlines continued to enjoy good growth at Stansted in November, 
Ryanair's traffic growth was low.
    Aberdeen grew 10.9 pct, Southampton 9.9 pct, Glasgow 5.6 pct and Edinburgh 4.5 pct.
    Among the key markets, other long haul (non-North Atlantic) traffic grew 9.9 pct, domestic 4.7 pct and European 
scheduled traffic increased 3.2 pct.
    The European charter market declined 13.4 pct, though this was accentuated by a sharp drop of 23 pct at BAA's 
Scottish airports where a number of leisure destinations have been reclassified as scheduled. The underlying 
decline was 8 pct.
    The North Atlantic market was 1.2 pct down on 2003.
    In total, BAA's airports recorded an increase of 3.2 pct in air transport
movements during the month while cargo tonnage grew 2.3 pct.
    BAA shares closed Thursday at 586-1/2 pence, valuing the group at 6.28 bln stg.

Shares on Europe's major bourses are seen opening in negative territory following losses for US blue chips 
yesterday and after Asia closed lower, while investors eagerly await Germany's ZEW survey for further insight into 
the state of Europe's biggest economy, dealers said.
    Over on Wall Street last night, indices closed mixed as big gains in technology stocks helped the Nasdaq close 
just short of its high for the year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished in the red after a spate of 
brokerage downgrades.
    The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 3.29 points at 2,151.25, while the Dow closed down 45.15 points at 
10,547.06.
    Across Asia, the Nikkei 225 index finished down 108.33 points at 10,873.63, and the Hang Seng index closed the 
morning session 57.70 points lower to 14,199.16.
    Oil prices again broke the 43 usd level in Asian trading but the market was calm as focus shifted to OPEC, 
following a bloody attack on the US consulate in the Saudi port city of Jeddah.
    At 03.25 GMT, New York's benchmark contract, light sweet crude for delivery in January, stood at 43.10 usd, 
after closing at 42.98 overnight.
    Meanwhile, the US dollar was easier against the euro and yen in early afternoon trade in Asia, after making a 
modest comeback in New York trade.
    At 03.50 GMT, the US unit was quoted at 102.89 yen, down from 103.03 earlier in Sydney, while the euro bought 
1.3415 usd, up from 1.3399 usd in Sydney and from 1.3400 usd in late New York trade.
 On the data front, all eyes will be on Germany's ZEW economic expectations index for December, due at 10.00 
GMT, and seen at +11.0 from +13.9 the previous month.
    Key US data today include October consumer credit, due after the European market close. 
    In Europe, corporate newsflow remains light as the flow of earnings report dries out ahead of the Christmas 
holiday.
    Credit Suisse Group will be under scrutiny as it said at an investor day this morning that it is to prepare its 
insurance unit Winterthur for capital market floatation, as the market is not prepared to pay enough for Winterthur at 
present.
Euroshares - marginally lower after mixed NY , lower Asia; ZEW survey eyed
    It added it forecasts in its CSFB investment banking unit 2007 net income of 3 bln sfr or more, and it will try to 
create a 'more focused' franchise at CSFB.
    Credit Suisse said it will pay an annual dividend of 1.50 sfr per share.
    Finally, on the brokers' front, Italy's Generali has been upgraded to 'outperform' from 'neutral' at Goldman Sachs, 
while Ryanair has been raised to 'buy' from 'neutral' at Merrill Lynch.

U.S.-listed shares of European companies rose Wednesday as a drop in the price of oil to under $46 a barrel 
sparked a broad rally that overwhelmed some weakness among energy companies.
The Bank of New York European ADR Index rose 1.84 points to close at 124.56.
Oil sensitive stocks such as airlines and car makers were especially strong, with Ryanair Holdings   rising 7.9 
percent, British Airways   up 5.6 percent and Air France - KLM climbing 2 percent.
Car makers Fiat SpA   and DaimlerChrysler AG   were both higher, too.
Many other sectors were also lifted by oil's drop to a low not seen since September.
One of the few sectors to show any significant weakness was energy, where more stocks fell than rose. Ao 
Tatneft   was the biggest loser, followed by Stolt Offshore  . All the major national oil companies were weak.
The only part of the sector that managed to hold on to gains were oil field services companies such as Compagnie 
Generale de Geophysique  , which rose 6.1 percent. Smedvig A.S.  , a drilling contractor, gained 3.3 percent. 
Technip SA   rose 0.5 percent and the Shell Transport and Trading Company   climbed 0.1 percent.
Technology sectors were all mostly higher, with only software showing some weakness, mainly due to a 17 percent 
drop at Skilsoft Plc.  , on news that it cut its financial outlook.

Ryanair Holdings PLC CEO Michael O'Leary said in an interview in La Repubblica he sees his airline growing for at 
least another five years, reaching 55 mln passengers carried per year.
    O'Leary was commenting in the newspaper yesterday on Italy's Volare failure and Ryanair's effort to take 
advantage of this.
He said he sees Ryanair's passengers in Italy reaching 10 mln in 2006.
    "The government's intervention on Volare changes nothing for us. Whether Volare is saved or not, Ryanair will 
grow a lot in Italy. We will open new routes in Italy," O'Leary was quoted saying.
    On Friday, the government launched a decree to put Volare into special administration in an effort to rescue the 
airline.
    O'Leary said Ryanair's Italian expansion via new routes will boost passenger numbers to 7.5 mln, and 10.5 mln 
by Spring 2006.
    "Italy is already a quarter of our market and offers great opportunities. Last week I met the heads of 23 Italian 
airports, nearly all of them. Soon we will launch a lot of new internal routes," he said.
    Volare failed because it did not match its low fares with low costs, while Alitalia has a fine tradition but 
uncompetitive tariffs, he said.
    Ryanair can grow "for at least five years, up to 55 mln passengers. But we do other things: we sell hotels, 
shopping, credit cards," he said.
    Ryanair does not plan to expand outside Europe because the same regulatory freedom does not exist there, he 
said.
    On oil, he said the price is "no problem. The price will rise in the winter, then will fall again."

Ryanair PLC may face a dispute with the east German state of Thuringia over the closure of its Stansted to Erfurt 
route, which the state's Ministry of Transportation pointed out violates the six month notice period included in its 
contract with Ryanair.
    An exception is possible if there are "important reasons" for cancelling the contract, the Ministry said.
 A Ryanair spokeswoman said the airline cannot be forced to "service a route that is loss-making," but added the 
company is open to talks.
    Ryanair announced yesterday it plans to close its "under performing" route from Stansted to Erfurt on Jan 19 and 
its Barcelona to Turin route on March 1.

(Updating with more comments, background)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is planning to expand in the Italian market following the collapse of the low-cost 
airline Volare last week.
    The Irish budget airline said it will start a twice daily service from Paris Beauvais) to Venice (Treviso) and 
alsoannounced that it wants to hold talks with the Italian airports affected by the collapse of Volare about beginning 
low-fare domestic flights within Italy on routes previously served by Volare.
    "Clearly a lot of Italian airports have lost significant traffic volumes as a result of Volare's collapse and we have 
invited all of these airports to meetings in Milan this week to see if we can help them to launch low-fare domestic 
and international routes, to make up for the traffic they have lost as a result of Volare's collapse," said Ryanair 
deputy chief executive, as he unveiled the airline's expansion plans at a press conference in Milan today.
    "Ryanair already flies to almost all of the airports in Italy previously served by Volare and we expect to announce 
further route expansion to and from these airports in the not too distant future subject to the successful conclusion 
of satisfactory agreements with these airports," he said.
    He also offered free flights to stranded Volare passengers, subject to airport and government taxes.
    Volare suspended all its activities last Friday. The group, which comprises Air Europe, Volare and Volare.Web, 
cited "the impossibility of having aircraft available" as reason for stopping its activities.
 Earlier this week, Italy's Welfare Minister Roberto Maroni said the government will study enforcing controlled 
administration and creditor protection for Volare, similar to the one used for the collapsed food group Parmalat 
Finanziaria SpA.

Aer Lingus lacks capital to compete in low-cost airline market - Goldman report
Aer Lingus lacks capital to compete in low-cost airline market -Goldman

Irish state airline Aer Lingus's goal of becoming a leading low-cost airline has been hampered by a lack of capital, 
according to a report by Goldman Sachs commissioned by the Irish government.
    Aer Lingus's strategy, Goldman said in its report, has been to transform itself into "one of Europe's leading low-
fares airlines and a pioneering profitable long-haul, lower-fares airline," but it has faced stiff competition.
    "If Aer Lingus sees its primary competition as the low-cost carriers, it may be disadvantaged with a significantly 
weaker capital structure than those carriers.
    "The most successful airlines in the current and evolving landscape view financial strength as a competitive issue 
and seek to maintain low levels of debt," the report said.
    The document examines a range of options for the future ownership and financing of the state airline, including 
its possible privatisation.
    Aer Lingus is expected to make about 100 mln eur in profit this year, but needs funds to develop and, in 
particular, to replace its long-haul aircraft fleet.
    It said yesterday it is talking to both leading aircraft companies Airbus Industrie and Boeing Co about replacing 
the long-haul fleet, with a final decision expected to be taken in about three months.
    The carrier has been convulsed by the resignation last week of chief executive Willie Walsh, chief financial officer 
Brian Dunne and chief operations officer Seamus Kearney, who have been closely identified with the improvement 
in the company's performance.
    The three, who will leave in May, had at one stage planned a management buyout of the company but the 
proposal was ruled out by Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern.
 The Goldman Sachs report said that if it was to remain state-owned, Aer Lingus, while it is well capitalised at 
present, would have to be more conservative than its competitors since access to capital was constrained.
    "Aer Lingus is disadvantaged with respect to its competitors. In periods of distress the future of the airline may be 
threatened," it said.
Aer Lingus lacks capital to compete in low-cost airline market - Goldman report
    It said there were two broad capital structure policy alternatives: either the "low-cost" model like competitors 
Ryanair and easyJet, and the "traditional airline" model with relatively high levels of debt such as Air France and 
British Airways.

Italy's civil aviation regulator ENAC said it has suspended Volare airline's air transport licence for one month 
because of the company's financial and operating situation.
    Last Friday, Volare announced it was halting flights and ticket sales after losing access to its leased airline fleet, 
and has since said it is insolvent.
 "The licences can be made valid again, based on an examination of a possible new financial and operational 
situation, and after an analysis of the airline's safety standards," ENAC said.
    Volare was reported to have opposed suspension of the licence for two to three months while it sought to deal 
with the airline's liquidity crisis.
    Earlier today, Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is expanding its routes in Italy to take advantage of Volare's 
problems, including free flights for stranded Volare passengers.

Low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings will announce on Monday plans to set up an operating base in Liverpool, the 
Financial Times reported on its website.
    The report said the move into Liverpool's John Lennon airport puts the airline in head-to-head competition with 
rival EasyJet PLC, which has a heavy presence in the city.
 The Liverpool move represents an escalation in competition between the two low-cost pioneers. It follows 
EasyJet's planned launch in January of routes from London Gatwick to Cork, Shannon and Knock, three 
destinations in Ryanair's home market Ireland, the report said.
    Ryanair also said it would launch its own Gatwick to Knock route on Jan 19 with some fares as low as 4.99 stg 
excluding taxes and charges, while raising the number of flights on its London Stansted to Cork and Shannon to 
four a day.

ROUNDUP easyJet says will emerge as industry winner
ROUNDUP easyJet says will emerge as industry winner

easyJet PLC, Europe's second-largest no-frills airline, predicted the industry faces a turbulent 2005 but insisted it is 
well placed to emerge as one of few winners, sending its shares over 4 pct higher.
    "It's a challenging year ahead but easyJet without question is very well placed to mount those challenges and 
ultimately is going to be a winner in this segment," chief executive Ray Webster told reporters after the Luton-based 
carrier reported a 21 pct increase in full-year pretax profit, in line with its previous guidance.
    "I think we're better placed than anyone, quite frankly, to prosper in the long term," he said.
    For its first quarter (October to December 2004) easyJet forecast a load factor -- passengers as a proportion of 
the number of seats available -- and total revenue per passenger broadly the same as last year.
    "We continue to have limited visibility in regard to future fares; however, we expect the remaining months of 
winter to be challenging and that competition will be intense," said Webster. "In addition, fuel prices and foreign 
exchange remain unknown factors."
    Earlier this month, rival Ryanair Holdings PLC predicted a 5-10 pct decline in yields (average fare levels) for its 
second half to end-March 2005.
    Webster was unable to give guidance on full-year profitability. "Any number is going to be a guess," he said, 
adding, "we'll be where we end up."
    This caused anxiety among some brokers.
    "We are concerned that the limited visibility management has beyond the Christmas period does not provide any 
support to current valuation levels," said Morgan Stanley.
 But the US broker noted easyJet shares continue to be buoyed by speculation Icelandair will raise its 10.1 pct 
stake in the airline.
    For the year to end-September 2004 the carrier, which has issued two profit warnings this year, made a pretax 
profit of 62.2 mln stg, up from 51.5 mln stg last time.
    In September, easyJet had forecast pretax profit "in excess of 60 mln stg".
    Full-year revenue was up 17 pct to 1.09 bln stg, driven by a 20 pct increase in passengers to 24.3 mln.
ROUNDUP easyJet says will emerge as industry winner
    Total revenue per passenger was down 2 pct to 44.82 stg, reflecting increased competition, while the load factor 
edged up 0.4 percentage points to 84.5 pct.
    Earnings per share were up 25 pct to 10.3 pence and the airline ended the year with gross cash of 510 mln stg.
    "These are creditable results in challenging market conditions which have affected all airlines," said Webster.
    "They reflect the resilience of the easyJet business model and have strengthened our position in the European 
airline market. Both financially and operationally we are stronger than we have ever been before."
    The CEO pointed to "good opportunities" for easyJet in 2005. It expects to grow sales through further enhancing 
its network of 153 routes and 44 airports and building ancillary revenues. It also has a renewed focus on costs.
    The airline is 30 pct hedged on fuel through to the end of June 2005.
    "We are not sitting on our hands, there will be significant costs coming out of the business over the next few 
years," said Webster.
    But he declined to put a figure to the targeted cost savings.
    "They range from initiatives that we are absolutely certain we can get benefits from through to initiatives that we 
have a much lower probability of achieving," he said.
    In addition to securing benefits from increasing the number of Airbus A319s in the fleet, easyJet plans to increase 
both aircraft utilisation and crew productivity, reduce headcount (through natural attrition rather than compulsory 
redundancies), outsource further aspects of its business such as IT, and focus "intently" on third-party charges, 
particularly airports and handling agents, which collectively represent about 30 pct of the cost base.
    Following a review of its capacity growth programme the airline plans to increase the number of aircraft in its 
fleet, which currently stands at 93, by approximately 16 pct in 2005, less than the 24 pct rise previously planned. 
This will help in building yields.
    Meanwhile, Webster said he has "no idea" if Icelandair plans to up its stake in easyJet.
    Last month's stakebuilding by Icelandair, which includes the Icelandic flag carrier, sparked bid speculation 
despite its statement describing the holding as a "long-term trade investment".
    Last week, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, easyJet's founder and former chairman whose family own 41 pct of the airline, 
met Hannes Smarasen, Icelandair's chairman, as a courtesy.
    Then in a letter to the easyJet board Haji-Ioannou said he is not currently considering taking the company private 
or selling down his stake as he sees the brand as a "key component" of his overall easyGroup expansion plans.
    But intriguingly Haji-Ioannou reiterated that as long as he owns 10 pct of the stock he retains the right to be 
easyJet's chairman.
    At 11.48 am easyJet shares were up 7-3/4 pence at 191, valuing the airline at 763.2 mln stg.
    easyJet is expected to publish November traffic figures on Dec 7.

- U.S.-listed shares of European companies fell on Friday, as a rise in the price of oil weighed on airlines and 
carmakers and drug safety concerns weakened pharmaceutical stocks.
The Bank of New York European ADR Index fell 0.68 points to close at 120.92.
AstraZeneca   was among the big losers of the day, down 4.8 percent after a U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
official said the agency should take a close look at the U.K. pharmaceutical company's recently approved lipid-
lowering drug Crestor.
Most other drug stocks fell as well.
The rise in the price of a barrel of crude oil to more than $48 on Friday, its highest level in more than a week, also 
weighed on shares. The gain was sparked by renewed concerns about supplies from Russia and Iraq.
Airlines and carmakers, typically sensitive to movements in the price of oil, fell.
Fiat SpA   dropped 1.6 percent, while DaimlerChrysler AG   fell 1.5 percent.
Among airlines, Air France - KLM   fell 1.1 percent and British Airways   dropped 1.4 percent. Ryanair 
Holdings   gained 1 percent.
Energy companies were some of the biggest gainers for the day, benefiting from oil's rise.
Smedvig A.S.   rose 5.9 percent, Repsol YpF   climbed 1.3 percent and Eni SpA   gained 1 percent.
Total SA  , Compagnie Generale de Geophysique   and Ao Tatneft   were the only decliners.
Among technology stocks, communications technology, fixed-line communications, semiconductors and wireless 
shares were lower, while the software sector was mixed.

(Adds further detail)
     Airports operator TBI PLC was upbeat on its prospects for the second half, saying current trading is 
encouraging, as it reported that pretax profits more than doubled to 19.2 mln stg in the six months to Sept 30 from 
7.2 mln a year earlier.
    "We are pleased by the progress made in TBI's core businesses - we generated more turnover and earned 
greater profits in the first half of this year at each of our five continuing airports compared to the same period last 
year," the company said.
    Operating profit was up 64 pct at 24.1 mln stg as turnover rose 4 pct to 107.6 mln on the back of a 12 pct 
increase in passenger traffic through its airports to 10.8 mln.
    The group, which owns and/or operates London Luton, Belfast International and Cardiff International Airports, as 
well as a number of overseas airports, said the rise in profit was driven by an improvement in recurrent revenues - 
mainly due to the continued growth of the low-cost airlines - and an absence of any exceptional charges during the 
period.
    On a per share basis, earnings shot up to 1.79 pence from 0.01 pence a year earlier, but before goodwill 
amortisation and exceptionals they rose to 2.53 pence from 2.13 pence.
    The group said both easyJet and Ryanair are expanding their operations at Luton but added that any additional 
revenue from this is not expected to have an impact on the current year.
 "Trading in the initial weeks of the second half has been encouraging and the growth in passenger traffic to both 
domestic and European destinations, which characterised the first half, has continued," the group said in a 
statement.
    In October, overall passenger numbers rose 14 pct from a year earlier to 1.4 mln at the group's four European 
airports, driven by a 19 pct increase in low-cost carrier traffic.
    TBI said it plans to use the proceeds from the sale of its AGI unit in the US, which was completed at the end of 
September with a profit on disposal of about 5.0 mln usd, to finance the group's plan to take full control of London 
Luton.
TBI says current trading encouraging after H1 pretax more than doubles -UPDATE
    "The sale of AGI ahead of schedule and the acquisition of the London Luton minority leaves TBI well placed to 
deliver increased value to shareholders," said chief executive Keith Brooks.
    The interim dividend was maintained at 0.70 pence

Ryanair Holdings PLC chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline may launch further routes to and from 
Oporto in Portugal, if the service to London Stansted proves successful.
    In an interview with Portuguese daily Publico, O'Leary said that if the service, Ryanair's first to Portugal, proves 
successful upon its launch in January, then the airline could add new routes from Oporto to other European cities.
 O'Leary also said that more airlines will face bankruptcy if oil prices remain at their current high levels.
    "There are many companies which said they were already losing money when a barrel of oil cost 25 dollars. In 
the meantime they have gone under," he told Publico, giving Swissair and Belgian national carrier Sabena as 
examples.
    "Now a barrel costs 50 dollars," he added. "I have no doubts that there will be more losses, more bankruptcies."

Ryanair appeals wheelchair user ruling

Ryanair Holdings PLC today denied in the Appeal Court discriminating against a disabled traveller by refusing to 
provide him with a free wheelchair at Stansted Airport.
    The Dublin-based no-frills airline told the court it prides itself on giving priority treatment to wheelchair 
passengers and even makes a loss on some tickets sold to them.
    It is asking Lords Justices Brooke, Parker and Keene to overturn the ruling of Judge Crawford Lindsay QC at 
Central London County Court in January when he found the airline had discriminated against 55-year old father of 
three Robert Ross.
    The community worker from Islington, North London, was born with cerebral palsy and suffers from arthritis.
    He regularly travels from Stansted to Perpignan in France and after getting a cheap 10 stg flight objected to 
being charged 18 stg for the use of a wheelchair because he was unable to walk.
    Ross, backed by the Disability Rights Commission, won a total of 1,336 stg compensation -- 36 stg to cover the 
costs of the wheelchairs he hired, 300 stg to pay for a new wheelchair and 1,000 stg for injury to his feelings.
    But Ryanair, found guilty of discrimination, deny they are to blame and say that the airport owners (BAA PLC) are 
the guilty party and in breach of its duty to disabled passengers.
    Ryanair said that even though it is not obliged to do so it carries wheelchair passengers on its flights, but limits 
them to four at a time.
They are given priority boarding and a choice of seating along with accompanying carers.
    It also claims that for passengers who use their own wheelchairs, it is willing to pay the cost of someone pushing 
them through the airport, even though for some low ticket price customers, such as Ross, this results in it making a 
loss on those flights.
    The appeal, expected to last three days, continues.

ROUNDUP BA 's caution on yields takes shine off better Q2
ROUNDUP BA's caution on yields takes shine off better Q2

British Airways PLC's cautious comments on the outlook for yields or average fares have offset better-than-
expected second quarter results from the UK flag carrier, sending its shares lower.
    The airline maintained its revenue guidance for the year to March 31 2005 at growth of 2-3 pct, driven by volume 
increases, and said market conditions were broadly unchanged since its last report.
    However, the tone of BA's statement was more cautious. It now describes all market segments as price sensitive, 
whereas previously it cited premium long haul as a strong point. It also expects yields, down 5.1 pct in the second 
quarter, to continue to fall.
    The airline said October traffic was up 1.8 pct -- up 0.8 pct in premium and up 2.0 pct in non-premium. Passenger 
load factor -- passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available -- was up 1.2 percentage points to 74.2 
pct, meaning over a quarter of available seats remain empty.
    BA also adjusted upwards its guidance on full year fuel costs. It now expects these, net of hedging, to be some 
245 mln stg more than last year -- up 20 mln stg on its previous estimate, partially offset by passenger and cargo 
fuel surcharges forecast at 160 mln stg.
    "The term bloodbath was used by [Ryanair Holdings PLC chief executive] Michael O'Leary some time ago for this 
winter, I haven't seen anything to suggest that he's wrong," BA chief executive, Rod Eddington told reporters.
    "We believe it is going to be a very tough winter, we believe that yields will continue to be under pressure.
It will be the airlines that manage their businesses sensibly that will come through this."
    For the three months to Sept 30 BA made a pretax profit of 220 mln stg compared to analysts' consensus 
forecast of 176 mln stg and up from 105 mln stg in the same period last time which included the wildcat strike by 
London Heathrow check-in staff which cost the airline 40 mln stg. Turnover increased 2.2 pct to 2.03 bln stg on 
capacity up 3.1 pct and traffic up 4.4 pct.
    The three-month pretax profit took the result for the half-year to 335 mln stg versus 60 mln stg last time.
    BA made a second quarter operating profit of 240 mln stg compared to analysts' consensus forecast of 211 mln 
stg and up from 195 mln stg last time, taking the result for the half year to 390 mln stg versus 235 mln stg.
ROUNDUP BA 's caution on yields takes shine off better Q2
    "The improvement in operating profit continues to be driven by what we're doing on the cost front given that 
yields remain soft," said Eddington, noting that BA is "on track" to achieve its target of a further 450 mln stg of cost 
savings by March 2005, mainly by cutting external expenditure.
    Second quarter unit costs fell 6.1 pct -- the tenth consecutive quarter to see a decline.
    Although fuel costs increased 12.4 pct and employee costs were up 7.7 pct, as wage awards and increased 
pension contributions were only partially offset by manpower reductions, costs in virtually every other area, 
including selling, handling, and engineering, were down.
    BA cut its net debt to 3.29 bln stg, the lowest level since 1993, and ended the quarter with cash of 1.9 bln stg. But 
it again omitted an interim dividend.
    Eddington said he is "comfortable" with analysts' consensus year to end-March 2005 operating profit forecasts of 
about 420 mln stg, up from 405 mln stg last time.
    For the balance of the current financial year the airline is 75 pct hedged at around 32 usd a barrel, said finance 
director John Rishton.
    For the first quarter to end-June 2005 it is 50 pct hedged at 34-35 usd a barrel and 45 pct covered at the same 
price for the following two quarters. For 2006 it is currently 11 pct hedged at 34 usd a barrel.
    At 11.50 am BA shares were down 3 pence at 221-1/2, valuing the airline at 2.4 bln stg.
    "With oil prices remaining stubbornly high, a potential macro economic 'soft patch' approaching and US airlines 
transferring capacity onto transatlantic routes, things appear stacked against BA," Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein 
told clients.
    "Outside a softening in fuel prices, we struggle to see a catalyst for near term outperformance."

  UK blue chips spiked higher in afternoon trade as Wall Street opened strongly on the back of better than expected 
jobs data, dealers said.
    At 14.50 pm, the FTSE 100 index was 20.5 points higher at 4,748.8, with the broader indices all in positive 
territory.
    Volume was above average, with 1.7 bln shares changing hands in 164,731 deals.
    Meanwhile, the DJIA was 44.60 higher at 10,359.60 in early deals, continuing the Bush election win honeymoon, 
and as US non-farm payrolls increased by 337,000 in October - about double the expectation.
    However the rise to 5.5 pct in the unemployment rate tempered some enthusiasm.
    Sentiment was further boosted by news oil prices were just off five-week lows as rising stock piles eased worries 
of a supply shortage this winter.
    But crude did rise slightly as US troops prepare to storm the Iraqi city of Falluja, and as dealers kept a watchful 
eye on security on the West Bank as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat remains in a coma.
    Back in London, airlines were lifted by the relative low in the price of crude with BA the top blue-chip performer 
up 10-3/4 at 226-1/4.
    Buyers also came in for the stock ahead of its second quarter figures on Monday, in which the national carrier is 
expected to report improved profitability for the three months to Sept 30.
    Second line peer Ryanair was also up 0.18 eur at 4.91 while easyJet firmed 5-1/4 pence at 177, further helped by 
a 25 pct jump in October passenger numbers.
 Shares in Hanson also gained, up 13-1/2 at 430, lifted by press reports that the Republican victory in the 
Presidential race will lead to a revised settlement over asbestos litigation.
    This morning's Financial Times reported that business leaders in Washington are preparing to meet as soon as 
next month to work out a deal, with lobbyists increasingly confident that Republican gains in the Senate will allow 
the passage of a new bill next year.
    Positive broker comment was behind gains in Man group, 32 higher at 1,334, BT Group, up 4-3/4 at 192-1/2 and 
Allied Domecq 3-1/2 higher at 506-3/4.
London shares turn higher in afternoon trade as NY opens strongly on jobs data
    In a note to clients, Citigroup argued yesterday's share price fall in Man Group was overdone and advised 
investors buy the stock on current weakness.
    The same broker upgraded BT to 'buy' from 'hold' with a raised target of 220 pence from 190, saying the group 
has scope to more than double the dividend on a five-year view and expects the telecoms giant to begin gearing up 
the balance sheet on an 18 month view.
    While Allied Domecq benefited from news the drinks giant was upgraded to 'outperform' from 'in-line' at Goldman 
Sachs.
    The US broker said its full year 2004 results demonstrated that the growth at Allied Domecq is now at least in line 
with its peers.
    Standard Chartered was also in demand, up 19 pence to 1,021 on bid speculation following a report in today's 
Financial Times.
    The FT reported that the family of the late Singapore billionaire investor Khoo Teck Puat, the bank's largest 
shareholder, have rejected comments this week by the London-based bank's chairman, suggesting that they were 
unlikely to sell their 13.5 pct stake in the bank.
    News that Anglo-Dutch foods group Unilever awarded its account for planning and buying media across Europe 
to MindShare, a unit of WPP sent shares in the advertising group 6-1/2 pence higher at 563.
    Subject to finalising the agreement, MindShare is expect to take over the 1 bln eur account from January.
    On the downside, oil majors suffered with heavyweights BP and Shell losing 4-1/2 pence to 537-1/2 and 2-1/4 
lower at 433-1/2  respectively.
    Exploration group Cairn Energy though remained the top loser, losing 28 pence to 1,467.
    Scottish & Newcastle, meanwhile, dipped 2-3/4 pence to 410-3/4, giving up some of yesterday's gains following 
cautious comments from ABN Amro and Goldman Sachs.
    ABN downgraded the shares to 'sell' from 'reduce' on valuation, while Goldman reiterated its 'underperform' 
recommendation and advised switching into SABMiller.
    On the second line, MFI was the top gainer, up a further 6 pence to 114, as bid speculation continued.
    Kingfisher, down 1-1-/4 at 309-1/4, is rumoured to be interested in acquiring MFI's Howdens unit.
    Shares in Ultra Electronics were up 19 at 669 as the defence group was upgraded to 'buy' from 'neutral' at UBS, 
dealers said.
    In a note to clients, the broker argued Ultra is set to benefit from the upcoming Eurofigher contracts, and Bush's 
election victory.
    Among the midcap fallers, Premier Oil shed 44 pence to 585 after the company announced that drilling at its 
Capitaine-1A well has not encountered any obvious hyrdocarbons.
    While Randgold Resources, down 26 at 899, was hit by news it is to begin tapping a 60 mln usd loan to finance 
the development of its Loulo project.
    Offshore drilling contractor Abbot Group  was 3-1/2 lower at 212-1/2 after it bought ten oil rigs in Libya for 50 mln 
usd via the acquisition of Gibraltar-registered International Air Drilling Co Ltd.
    While acquisition news also dented  Brixton, 4 lower at 296, as it is poised to buy a portfolio of 163 mostly 
industrial properties worth 675 mln stg from Industrious Holdings subsidiaries.

     UK blue chips ended the day comfortably higher, but off earlier levels, as a spike in the price of oil offset initial 
enthusiasm over better-than-expected US jobs data, dealers said.
    At the close, the FTSE 100 index was 11.5 points higher at 4,739.8, off an intra-day peak of 4,761.9, with the

Share prices were still in positive territory at midday on the back of lower oil prices, though investors remained 
cautious ahead of key employment data in the US this afternoon, dealers said.
    By 11.53 am, the FTSE 100 index was up 15.4 points at 4743.7, while the broader FTSE indices were also 
firmer.
    Volume was moderate, with 967.1 mln shares changing hands in 88,767 deals.
    Wall Street is expected to give back some of the recent gains following Bush's election victory. The market will 
take direction from the release of the October unemployment rate, seen steady at 5.4 pct, and nonfarm payrolls for 
the same month, seen at 170,000 versus 96,000 in September.
    Meanwhile, oil prices were volatile in thin volumes in pre-weekend short-covering, with dealers keeping a 
watchful eye on security on the West Bank as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat remains in a coma.
    Brent contracts for December delivery were down 10 cents at 45.91 usd a barrel.
    In New York, light sweet crude contracts for December delivery were up 13 cents at 48.95 usd, also in pre-
market deals.
    In London, airlines were stronger, with British Airways jumping 6-1/4 pence to 221-3/4 amid easing fuel price 
concerns, while second liner Easyjet added 2-1/4 pence to 174 after announcing a 25 pct jump in October

    Ryanair was up 0.07 eur at 4.8.
    Positive broker comment was behind the gains in Man group, BT Group and Allied Domecq.
 Citigroup argued yesterday's share price fall in Man Group was overdone and advised investors buy the stock on 
current weakness.
    The same broker upgraded BT to 'buy' from 'hold' by Citigroup Smith Barney, with a raised target of 220 pence 
from 190.
    Citigroup argued that the group has scope to more than double the dividend on a five-year view and expects the 
telecoms giant to begin gearing up the balance sheet on an 18 month view.
London shares higher midday on weaker oil prices; NY seen flat pre jobs data
    BT was up 5-1/2 at 193-1/2.
    Blue-chip drinks group Allied Domecq, up 6-3/4 at 510, was upgraded to 'outperform' from 'in-line' at Goldman 
Sachs
    The US broker argued that the group's full year 2004 results demonstrated that the growth at Allied Domecq is 
now at least in line with its peers.
    Standard Chartered was also in demand, up 16 pence to 1,018 on bid speculation following a report in today's 
Financial Times.
    The FT reported that the family of the late Singapore billionaire investor Khoo Teck Puat, the bank's largest 
shareholder, have rejected comments this week by the London-based bank's chairman, suggesting that they were 
unlikely to sell their 13.5 pct stake in the bank.
    Shares in Hanson moved up 12 pence to 428-1/2 on press reports that Wednesday's Republican victory will lead 
to a revised settlement over asbestos litigation.
    This morning's Financial Times reported that business leaders in Washington are preparing to meet as soon as 
next month to work out a deal, with lobbyists increasingly confident that Republican gains in the Senate will allow 
the passage of a new bill next year.
    Oil stocks featured heavily among the losers, with BP and Shell losing 5-1/2 pence to 536 and 2 to 433-3/4, 
respectively. Exploration group Cairn Energy were also under pressure, losing 30 pence to 1,465.
    Scottish & Newcastle, meanwhile, dipped 3/4 pence to 412-3/4, giving up some of yesterday's gains following 
cautious comments from ABN Amro and Goldman Sachs.
    ABN downgraded the shares to 'sell' from 'reduce' on valuation, while Goldman reiterated its 'underperform' 
recommendation and advised switching into SABMiller.
    On the second line, MFI was the top gainer, up a further 6 pence to 114, as bid speculation continued.
    Kingfisher, down 1-1/4 at 309, is rumoured to be interested in acquiring MFI's Howdens unit.
    Among the midcap fallers, Premier Oil shed 47 pence to 582 after the company announced that drilling at its 
Capitaine-1A well has not encountered any obvious hyrdocarbons.
    Elsewhere, Cookson lost 1/2 to 34 after unexciting third quarter figures.
    Panmure however, upgraded the shares to 'hold' from 'sell', arguing that the third quarter numbers were better 
than expected, with total sales up 17 pct as it raised its 2004 and 2005 numbers.

(Updating with full report)     
     Share prices closed higher, led up by Novo Nordisk on FDA approval of the group's human growth hormone 
Norditropin for treating adults, and Copenhagen Airports, while Carlsberg fell sharply after it lowered its full-year 
operating and net profit forecasts, brokers said.     
    The KFX index closed 0.81 points higher at 278.27 and the KBX benchmark index was 0.96 points higher at 
248.61.       
    The KAX All Share index closed 0.54 points higher at 251.08 on turnover of 5.30 bln dkr.     
    "The Danish market is one of the few European markets to perform well today, and that has attracted some 
investors," a broker said.      
    Novo Nordisk B closed 6.5 dkr higher at 301 in a recovery from yesterday's fall, lifted by news that the US Food 
& Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the group's human growth hormone Norditropin for treating adults. The 
previous approval was for the long-term treatment of children with growth failure.
    "This is news the market likes," a broker said.
    Lundbeck shed 1.25 to 102.25, NeuroSearch was 2 lower at 212 and Novozymes B fell 1.5 to 263.5.
    Copenhagen Airports added 28 to 1,028 after the group started its share buyback programme. The company will 
buy back up to 10 pct of its own share capital, or 833,000 shares, provided that the value of the shares acquired 
does not exceed 800 mln dkr.
    "There are three factors in play here," a broker said.
"Firstly, the share buyback programme. Secondly, the solid nine-month earnings it reported earlier this week.
    "And thirdly, there is a political majority to remove the 75 dkr a passenger duty that passengers must pay when 
flying from Danish airports," the broker said. "This is expected to pull some traffic back from the airport at Malmoe, 
in southern Sweden and close to Copenhagen and used by Ryanair, and also lift the number of passengers who 
would choose other means of transport."
    SAS AB added 0.4 to 43.8.
Danish shares close higher, led by Novo Nordisk; Carlsberg lower UPDATE
    Carlsberg B fell 14 to 264 after the group lowered its full-year operating and net profit forecasts, citing 
disappointing figures at its Swedish operations, Carlsberg Sverige, unfavourable weather in Northern Europe and 
high marketing costs, especially in Russia, for the rest of the year.
    Carlsberg posted third-quarter EBITA of 1.513 bln dkr, compared with 1.671 bln dkr posted a year ago, and net 
sales of 10.137 bln dkr against 9.860 bln dkr. The SME consensus had been for an EBITA of 1.45 bln dkr and sales 
of 10.7 bln dkr.
    It also announced it is laying off 200 employees at its Swedish operations as part of new restructuring measures.
    "The market has punished the stock for the group's unexpected cut in forecasts," a broker said. "I expect that it 
will fall a little more before recovering … investors will want to hear some positive comments that the initiatives in 
Sweden are working."
    Danisco added 1 to 322.
    TDC was up 1.25 at 215 in a recovery from yesterday's fall.
    SBC Communications has sold its remaining 20.56 mln shares in TDC, equivalent to a 9.5 pct stake, and no 
longer holds any TDC shares.
    GN Store Nord shed 1 to 57.5, extending yesterday's fall, which came after it posted EBITA in the first nine 
months of the year of 534 mln dkr, up from 363 mln a year ago, but below the market's expectation of 557 mln. GN 
raised its full-year sales forecast to 5.4 bln dkr from 4.74 bln dkr in 2003 and from the previous forecast of at least 
5.2 bln dkr, and reiterated its full-year EBITA forecast of 725 mln dkr.
    Brokers said Merrill Lynch raised its target price to 74 dkr from 70 while reiterating its 'buy' stance.
    William Demant Holding was up 1 at 254.
    Danske Bank rose 0.75 to 169. "It has done well today despite a downgrade by Jyske Bank," a broker said. "Like 
other financial stocks, it is benefiting from the weakening of the US dollar, which is causing investors to place their 
money in financials."
    It was downgraded to 'reduce' from 'accumulate' at Jyske Bank, which cited valuation grounds. Jyske Bank has a 
180 dkr share price target on the Danske Bank shares.
    Nordea Bank added 0.5 to 52, while Jyske Bank fell 2.75 to 189.25.
    Group 4 Securicor rose 0.3 to 12.9. Swedish peer Securitas said third-quarter pretax profit rose 33 pct to 630 mln 
skr from 475 mln a year earlier, buoyed by higher margins and slightly increased sales. The result was above 
average market expectations of 588 mln skr, as recorded by SME Direkt.
    Falck added 0.4 to 49.1, while ISS shed 4 to 311.

(Updating to add more detail from Ryanair statement)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, reported better-than-expected second quarter profit 
and has raised its second half forecast for yields.
    For the second quarter period to Sept 30, the group's most profitable, the Dublin-based airline made a net profit 
of 147.6 mln eur -- significantly ahead of analysts' consensus forecast of 130 mln eur and versus 128.4 mln eur last 
time.
 Ryanair said it currently has no plans to change its policy of remaining unhedged against fuel prices and estimated 
that if Brent crude remained at 50 usd a barrel for the balance of the year its costs would increase by some 55 mln 
eur.
    It revised its guidance on yields (or average fare levels) upwards. It now expects a fall of 5-10 pct in the second 
half versus previous guidance of a decline of 10-20 pct. This will help offset the impact of higher fuel prices.
    The airline also claimed to be benefiting from the fuel surcharges imposed by other carriers.
    Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the board remains cautious on the full year outlook but he still forecast 
"significant increases in passenger volume growth… and increased load factors."
    For the six months to end-September net income was 200.1 mln eur, up from 168.9 mln eur a year earlier.
    First half yields were down 5 pct, at the lower end of the airline's guidance of a fall of 5-10 pct.
    Ryanair shares closed Monday at 4.01 eur. The shares slumped over 30 pct in January after the carrier issued its 
first profit warning since it floated in 1997 and have so far failed to recover.

BAA H1 profits rise, makes 7 mln stg provision against Ryanair UPDATE

(Updating with Ryanair provision, further details)
     BAA PLC, operator of seven UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, reported a rise in interim 
profits helped by a 7.5 pct rise in passenger traffic.
    For the six months to Sept 30, the group posted pretax profits of 363 mln stg against 312 mln a year earlier on 
revenue of 1.13 bln stg against 1.03 bln last year.
    Passenger traffic in the period rose 7.5 pct to 77.5 mln, while BAA said it expects full year passenger traffic 
growth to be over 6 pct.
    The group said its underlying performance was impacted by a 7 mln stg provision against Europe's largest low-
cost carrier Ryanair for unpaid bills.
    "BAA has invoiced Ryanair an additional 7 mln stg since July as a result of its repudiation of existing agreements 
by the non-payment of its airport charges," BAA said.
    "Given the current litigation with Ryanair, a 7 mln stg provision has also been established."
    The interim dividend came in at 6.9 pence against 6.6 pence last time. Net debt at Sept 30 2004 was 3.196 bln 
stg compared to 2.770 bln at March 30 2004.
    Chief executive Mike Clasper said: "We still anticipate net retail income per passenger for the full year to be in 
line with that achieved last year.
    "We also face the continuing challenge of difficult industrial relations across much of the aviation industry."
    He added that the building of Terminal 5 -- on which the group spent 378 mln stg in the six month period out of 
an overall capital expecnditure of 709 mln -- remains on budget and ahead of schedule.
 Heathrow passenger numbers rose 7.6 pct to 35.8 mln in the six months, mainly as a result of 10.1 pct growth in 
North Atlantic traffic and a 15.2 pct increase in other long haul passengers.    
    "This increase reflected both underlying real growth in these markets and a weak comparative first quarter due to 
the Iraq war and SARS epidemic," Clasper said.
    Meanwhile, Gatwick saw growth of 4.9 pct, with low cost carriers contributing significantly to the 17.1 pct rise in 
European scheduled traffic, offsetting the 7.9 pct decrease in the European charter market.
BAA H1 profits rise, makes 7 mln stg provision against Ryanair UPDATE
    Stansted and Southampton recorded increases of 12.0 pct and 16.9 pct respectively, mainly due to continued 
growth in demand for low cost services, while all the Scottish airports recorded growth in traffic, with 6.0 pct and 7.6 
pct at Glasgow and Edinburgh respectively.
    Net retail income from airports grew 9.1 pct to 312 mln in the period.

Leading shares are expected to open slightly firmer as a dip in the price of oil overnight is likely to offset jitters 
ahead of today's bitterly fought US election, dealers said.
    According to spread-betting firm IG Index, the FTSE 100 index is seen starting the day around 3 points higher 
after closing yesterday's session up 49.6 points at 4,673.8.
    Meanwhile, US stocks ended Monday's session higher -- the last full day of trading before the US goes to the 
polls -- as blue chips posted a fifth straight session of gains on a one-month low for oil prices.
    The DJIA closed up 26.92 points at 10,054.39, off an intraday high of 10,076.59 reached when oil fell below 50 
usd for the first time in a month in late morning trading.
    Across Asia overnight, the Nikkei 225 index closed up 153.10 points at 10,887.81, while the Hang Seng was 
157.03 points higher at 13,251.28 by midday.
    Asian markets were boosted as crude oil prices slipped below 50 usd a barrel, with New York's benchmark 
contract down 0.23 usd to 49.90 a barrel from its close of 50.13 usd in New York overnight.
    Back in London, the US election will unsurprisingly take centre stage with investors looking for a quick, decisive 
result to the race.
    But fears have grown there could be a repeat of 2000's legal debacle as all polls are showing the race for the 
White House is too close to call.
    Reports that over 50,000 postal ballots in Florida have already gone missing in the run up to today's vote did little 
to calm nerves.
    Away from politics, on the corporate front, the aviation sector will be in focus after budget airline Ryanair posted 
better-than-expected results, and with airport operator BAA tipped to post interim numbers later this morning.
    The Dublin-based airline posted net profit for the second quarter of 147.6 mln eur against 128.4 mln eur, 
significantly ahead of analysts' consensus forecast of 130 mln eur.
     Ryanair said it currently has no plans to change its policy of remaining unhedged against fuel prices.
    But it revised its forecast on yields (average fares). It now expects a fall of 5-10 pct in the second half versus 
previous guidance of a decline of 10-20 pct.
London shares outlook - slightly higher as oil price dip offsets US election
    Meanwhile, BAA, which operates seven UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, is expected to 
report a 14 pct increase in first-half pretax profit.
    The performance reflects a 7.5 pct increase in passenger numbers to 77.5 mln and improved retail spending as 
long-haul markets have recovered, particularly high-spending Asians post SARS.
    For the six months to Sept 30 analysts are forecasting a consensus pretax profit of 362 mln stg up from 312 mln 
stg last time, on revenue of 1.14 bln stg versus 1.04 bln stg.
    In retail, investors in Matalan, the discount and homewares retailer subject to persistent bid speculation, will 
focus on current trading, the outlook for the crucial Christmas period and the possible sale of the Lee Cooper jeans 
business when it publishes interim results.
    The perennial issue of the ongoing commitment to the business of John Hargreaves, the group's founder, 
executive chairman and 52 pct shareholder, will also inevitably raise its head.
    For the 26 weeks to Aug 28 analysts are forecasting a pretax profit of 41-44 mln stg versus 41.2 mln stg last 
time.
    Retail will also be in focus with the CBI monthly distributive trades survey due later this morning and the BRC 
shop price index this evening.
    But more importantly, on the economic front, the market is forecasting construction PMI date to drop to + 56.5 
against + 56.8 previously.

 Away from politics, on the corporate front, British Airways was one of the top gainers, on the back of the falling 
price of crude. Shares in the national carrier were up 2-1/4 at 218-1/4.
    And the aviation sector was also in focus after airport operator BAA and budget airline Ryanair pleased the 
market with strong numbers.
    BAA, which operates seven UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, gained 1 pence at 574-1/2 
after the group reported interim pretax profits of 363 mln stg against 312 mln a year earlier.
    Passenger traffic in the period rose 7.5 pct to 77.5 mln.
London shares slightly higher at open as oil price dip offsets US election
    Panmure said BAA's profit came in line with expectations, and highlighted that Terminal 5 remains on track, as it 
reiterated its 'hold' rating.
    Meanwhile, Ryainair was 0.30 eur higher at 4.31 after it posted better-than-expected results.
    The Dublin-based airline posted net profit for the second quarter of 147.6 mln eur against 128.4 mln eur, 
significantly ahead of analysts' consensus forecast of 130 mln eur and raised second-half yield forecasts.
    In response Merrill Lynch reiterated its 'neutral' stance, saying it remains cautious on investment in the European 
low-cost sector generally -- and Ryanair specifically -- because it believes the potential for earnings risk and de-
rating remains into the long term.
    But it acknowledged that the shorter-term picture may be firmer thanks to better-than-expected second-quarter 
results and yield outlook.

    Across Asia overnight, the Nikkei 225 index closed up 153.10 points at 10,887.81, while the Hang Seng was 
157.03 points higher at 13,251.28 by midday.
    Asian markets were boosted as crude oil prices slipped below 50 usd a barrel, with New York's benchmark 
contract down 0.23 usd to 49.90 a barrel from its close of 50.13 usd in New York overnight.
    Back in London, the US election will unsurprisingly take centre stage with investors looking for a quick, decisive 
result to the race.
    But fears have grown there could be a repeat of 2000's legal debacle as all polls are showing the race for the 
White House is too close to call.
    Reports that over 50,000 postal ballots in Florida have already gone missing in the run up to today's vote did little 
to calm nerves.
    Away from politics, on the corporate front, British Airways was one of the top gainers, on the back of the falling 
price of crude. Shares in the national carrier were up 2-1/4 at 218-1/4. Other oil guzzlers also gained - ICI was 1-1/4 
higher at 214-1/2
    And the aviation sector was also in focus after numbers from airport operator BAA and budget airline Ryanair 
pleased the market.
London shares edge higher as oil price dip offsets US election fears - UPDATE
     BAA, which operates seven UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, gained 1 pence to 574-1/2 
after the group reported interim pretax profits of 363 mln stg against 312 mln a year earlier.
    Passenger traffic in the period rose 7.5 pct to 77.5 mln.
    Panmure said BAA's profit came in line with expectations, and highlighted that Terminal 5 remains on track, as it 
reiterated its 'hold' rating.
    Meanwhile, Ryainair was 0.30 eur higher at 4.31 after it posted better-than-expected results.
     The Dublin-based airline posted net profit for the second quarter of 147.6 mln eur against 128.4 mln eur, 
significantly ahead of analysts' consensus forecast of 130 mln eur. It also raised second half yield forecasts.
    In response Dresdner upped its rating on the airline to 'buy' from hold'.
    easyJet rose 1-1/2 to 161 in sympathy. 
    Broker comment also lifted Kingfisher, up 2 at 308-3/4 after Dredsner upgraded its stance to 'buy' from 'hold' as 
the broker recommended a switch out of Dixons - up 1/2 at 173-1/2.
    Dresdner argued that B&Q's competitive advantage, based on range and supply chain domination, looks 
sustainable into a consumer slowdown.
    A firmer dollar, ahead of today's elections, helped boost UK companies with heavy exposure to the US. 
Amvescap was 2 higher at 530, Carnival was up 15 at 2,936, Pearson 2 ahead at 603, Bunzl 2 higher at 424, Reed 
Elsevier 2-1/2 higher at 497, and Tomkins up 1-1/4 at 255-1/4.
    On the downside, Smith & Nephew was the top faller, down 6-1/2 at 469-1/2 after broker inspired gains yesterday 
and a weak performance by pharmas overnight in the US.
    Struggling supermarket group Sainsbury was also knocked, down 4-1/2 at 263, after a good run on the back of 
bid speculation, after the Financial Times quoted a member of the Sainsbury family dismissing any rumours of a 
deal.
    On the second line, house builders gained on expectations of a rate freeze on Thursday.
    Wilson Bowden was 14 higher at 979, Taylor Woodrow was 2 up at 237-1/4, Westbury up 5 at 382, and Slough 
Estates was 2-1/4 higher at 455-1/4.
    This offset news Slough Estates was booted out of JP Morgan's Model Portfolio.
    But Matalan fell 2-3/4 to 225 after in-line numbers at the discount retailer failed to inspire.
    In response, Merrill Lynch reiterated its 'neutral' stance while CSFB repeated 'underperform'.
    News that RAC is to transfer its Leyland parts distribution business to the owner of Leyland Trucks drove its 
shares down 8-1/2 to 657-1/2.
    Fellow faller International Power was 1-3/4 lower at 159 after it was downgraded to 'equal-weight' 
from'overweight' at Lehman.
    While finally, Investec repeating its 'hold' rating on Tate & Lyle ahead of results this week hit shares in the sugar 
company by 4-1/4 to 427.

Euroshares open comfortably higher on good earnings, falling oil prices

Shares in Europe's leading bourses open upbeat, encouraged by easing oil prices and positive earnings reports, 
although investors remain wary ahead of today's US presidential elections, dealers said.
    At 09.00 am, the STOXX 50 was 0.4 pct higher, or up 10.89 points to 2,726.04, while the STOXX 600 gained 
0.31 pct, or 0.75 points to 243.06.
    Yesterday on Wall Street, the DJIA yesterday closed up 26.92 points at 10,054.39, while the Nasdaq Composite 
Index climbed 4.88 points to 1,979.87.
    Voting is due to start in the US today, although there are concerns that the eventual outcome of the presidential 
elections may take a while longer to be decided amid reports of over 50,000 missing postal ballots in Florida.
    In Europe, trading benefits from lower oil prices.
    Crude oil prices slipped below 50 usd a barrel in Asian trading.
    At 3.25 GMT, New York's benchmark contract, light sweet crude for delivery in December, was down 23 cents to 
49.90 a barrel from its close of 50.13 usd in New York overnight.
    Investors also welcome a handful of positive earnings reports.
    Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, surged almost 8 pct in early morning trade after Dresdner Kleinwort 
Wasserstein upgraded the discount airline to 'buy' from 'hold' following strong second quarter results.
    Earlier today, Ryanair reported better-than-expected second quarter profit and raised its second half forecast for 
yields.
    Ryanair shares added 0.32 eur, or 7.98 pct, at 4.33.
    UBS shares gained 1.5 sfr, or 1.71 pct, at 89, as the market welcomed its third quarter results that were broadly 
in line with expectations.
 Third quarter net income fell to 1.671 bln sfr from 1.974 bln in the second quarter on the back of a 20 pct drop in 
equities and fixed income trading.
    Private bank Wegelin said that net income was a little light, and costs slightly higher than expected.
    However, net new money beat expectations and income at UBS' Wealth Management unit beat market 
consensus, Wegelin said.
Euroshares open comfortably higher on good earnings, falling oil prices
    ING said that fundamentals "look positive".
    Credit Suisse Group shares benefited from peer UBS' results, rising 0.2 sfr or 0.48 pct at 41.7.
    Assa Abloy was sharply higher -- up 4.17 pct at 100 skr -- after the world's biggest lock maker announced higher-
than-expected third quarter results and hiked its outlook for 2004-2005.
    Carnegie reiterated its 'outperform' rating following what it called "great numbers".
    The broker underlined Assa Abloy's "strong organic growth" of 6 pct, beating the consensus at 4.3 pct.
    Assa Abloy third quarter pretax profit rose to 605 mln skr from 467 mln in the same period last year, and also 
raised its outlook for 2004-2005. It said organic sales growth is expected to continue at a good rate.    
    Still on the positive side, Fresenius Medical Care pushed higher after the world's largest renal care company 
accompanied its solid set of third quarter figures by raising its full year net profit guidance.
    FMC said its third quarter EBIT rose 9 pct to 214 mln usd, against the range of expectations pegged by analysts 
polled by AFX News of 205-217 mln usd.
    FMC raised its full-year net income guidance to high-teens percentage growth from mid-teens growth.
    The German group's shares were up 0.31 eur or 0.51 pct at 61.41.
    On the downside, energy stocks underperformed as oil prices continue to fall: Royal Dutch lost 0.07 pct or 0.03 
eur to 42.43, while Total was up only 0.12 pct, or 0.2 eur to 163.8.
    Philips recorded one of the sharpest falls after Citigroup Smith Barney downgraded its recommendation on the 
stock to 'sell' from 'hold'.
    The broker also slightly cut its target price to 17 eur from 18 eur after introducing a new earnings model, as it has 
transferred coverage of Philips to new analyst Lionel Rayon, who argued earnings "are likely to be depressed in the 
next six quarters".
    He underlined the down cycle in semiconductors and LCD displays, increasing problems in TV tubes and lack of 
turnaround in consumer electronics.
    Philips shares shed 0.91 pct, or 0.17 eur, to 18.59.
    DaimlerChrysler also underperformed on a negative broker comment.
    Morgan Stanley has lowered its 2005 EPS forecast for the German car maker by 9 pct to 3.10 eur, with its price 
objective for the stock falling to 38 eur from 44, citing a deteriorating outlook for Mercedes.
    Morgan Stanley continues to have an 'overweight' stance on DaimlerChrysler's
shares, though.
    DaimlerChrysler was unchanged at 32.93 eur.

Wall Street outlook - U.S. stock futures higher ahead of U.S. vote
Wall Street outlook - U.S. stock futures higher ahead of U.S. vote

Dateline: LONDON
Body
U.S. stock futures were holding moderate gains early Tuesday as America gears up for what even radio stations in 
London have taken to calling "the election."
European stocks were showing small gains, reflecting the drop in crude oil futures. The active New York contract 
was last just under the $50 mark. European airline stocks were among the big gainers.
Still volumes were relatively thin in European stocks and expected to remain so until the U.S. vote takes shape.
The dollar was little changed against the key European currencies - last at $1.27 on the euro. A decisive victory for 
either candidate is likely to trigger a dollar rally, some currency analysts have maintained. The dollar dropped 3 
percent on a trade-weighted basis in October, partly reflecting the risk of an uncertain result.
Market activity could improve after a depressed third quarter for stocks and debt trading if a "clear" result emerges 
from the U.S. election, the chief financial officer at Swiss banking giant UBS said on Tuesday.
"Assuming there is a clear result, it is quite possible that market activity may become more buoyant, although there 
are plenty of reasons to be cautious," Clive Standish said after UBS posted its third quarter profits, AFX News 
reported from Zurich.
Standish said market activity isn't currently showing a "significant pick-up" from the third quarter. UBS equity and 
fixed income trading revenue dropped 20 percent in the third quarter.
The Dow industrials futures were up 38 points at 10,080 ahead of 7 a.m. Eastern. The Nasdaq 100s and S&P 500 
futures were each up a few points. European chip stocks were mixed after warning overnight from chipmaker 
National Semiconductor on inventories.
Focus stocks
Shares of Finnish mobile phone maker Nokia Corp.   were up 0.3 percent in the home market. The Wall Street 
Journal overnight noted that Nokia plans to launch a handheld personal-organizer product this year. The product 
underlines the rivalry with Microsoft  .
Elsewhere in the PC stocks, Bear Stearns analysts overnight lowered its PC unit estimates for the fourth quarter, 
citing softness in the U.S. consumer. Analysts now see fourth quarter sequential growth at 16 percent, or up 13 
Wall Street outlook - U.S. stock futures higher ahead of U.S. vote
percent on the year. That is down from a prior projection for 19 percent sequential growth in the industry's most 
important quarter.
MSFT was a few cents higher in euro trading in Frankfurt at $28.12 in the early-going. Cisco Systems   was seeing 
small activity at $19.22, down a few cents. Trading was too thin to set a definitive trend.
Irish low-fare carrier Ryanair   predicted a "bloodbath" and "airline casualties", accelerated by record high oil prices, 
as it revealed its results for the half year. Shares soared nearly 8 percent in London trade as it said it expects 
passenger yield to fall by less than previously expected in the second half.
CGI Group  , the information technology and business process services company expects earnings growth of 25 to 
35 percent to 52 to 56 Canadian cents a share in fiscal 2005 and revenue to increase 20 to 28 percent to $3.9 
billion to $4.15 billion.
Overnight, shares of National Semiconductor   fell 7.8 percent to $15.39 after it lowered its fiscal second-quarter 
financial targets due to weak demand and high inventory.
Maxim Integrated Products Inc.   fell 1.9 percent to $43.35 after it reported a fiscal first-quarter profit of 42 cents per 
share on revenue of $435.1 million. It was expected to earn 42 cents per share on sales of $454 million.
From the brokers, Piper Jaffray cut PeopleSoft   to market-perform from outperform, saying that despite the higher 
bid from Oracle  , it believes "the risk/reward at the current price of $22.93 is less attractive."
A higher bid than the $24 per share offered by Oracle may be necessary to garner the support of the PeopleSoft 
board for a transaction. Piper said that given that the PeopleSoft board viewed the "previous $26 bid insufficient, it 
seems likely that they will recommend that shareholders reject the $24 offer."
Merrill Lynch downgraded insurance firm the Willis Group   to neutral from buy, saying that "the fundamental 
backdrop will continue to be a headwind for the company." The broker also said: "While the market appears to be 
assuming that Willis will not be accused of the type of market manipulation and bid-rigging that has been alleged 
against Marsh & McLennan   (an assumption we share), we can not rule out a scenario where other conflict-of-
interest allegations are made against Willis."

Leading shares remained in positive territory in midmorning trade, although below early highs as relief over lower oil 
prices failed to offset the market's caution ahead of tonight's US presidential election, dealers said.
    By 10.00 am, the FTSE 100 index was up 5.9 points at 4,679.7, off its early high of 4,689.0, while the broader 
indices were also firmer.
    Volume was on the thin side however, with 341.3 mln shares changing hands in 38,553 deals.
    Looking ahead to Wall Street, the DJIA is seen opening around 25 points higher, while the Nasdaq is seen up 
around 5, as traders gamble on a US equity-friendly Bush victory.
    Easing oil prices also provided some support to US futures, with US December crude slipping below 50 usd a 
barrel in Asia this morning.
    Relief over easing fuel prices kept British Airways at the top of the FTSE 100 risers in London in midmorning 
trade, up 3-1/2 pence to 219-1/2.
    Fellow oil consumers ICI and Carnival meanwhile, gained 2-1/4 pence to 215-1/2 and 20 pence to 2,941 
respectively.
    London listed no-frills airline Ryanair was also in demand, up 0.34 eur at 4.35 after posting better than expected 
interim results and an upbeat outlook.
    Dresdner Kleinwort was bullish, upgrading the shares to 'buy' from 'hold', arguing that while there may still be 
casualties in the low cost carrier sector this winter, these figures substantially reduce the uncertainty regarding the 
competitive environment and fuel costs.
 Sector peer easyJet added 4 pence to 163-1/2.
    Remaining in the travel sector, blue-chip airports operator BAA gained 2 pence to 575-1/2 after the group 
reported interim pretax profits of 363 mln stg against 312 mln a year earlier.
    Passenger traffic in the period rose 7.5 pct to 77.5 mln.
    Panmure said BAA's profit came in line with expectations, and highlighted that Terminal 5 remains on track, as it 
reiterated its 'hold' rating.
London shares slip from highs in midmorning trade as US election jitters weigh
    Elsewhere, positive broker comment lifted Kingfisher, up 2 at 308-3/4 after Dredsner upgraded its stance to 'buy' 
from 'hold' as the broker recommended a switch out of Dixons - up 1/2 at 173-1/2.
    Dresdner argued that B&Q's competitive advantage, based on range and supply chain domination, looks 
sustainable into a consumer slowdown.
    SABMiller shares were also boosted by upbeat analyst comments, with CSFB and Deutsche Bank both raising 
their target on the drinks giant ahead of its results on Nov 18.
    Meanwhile, 3i Group shares gained 6-1/2 pence to 596 as the market welcomed the appointment of the group's 
new finance director Simon Ball.
    The venture capital giant is also due to post its interim results on Thursday.
    Also reporting results on Thursday, Smith & Nephew fell 6-1/2 pence to 469-1/2, as investors cautiously took 
profits. The shares have outperformed in the past few sessions following upbeat results from US sector peers.
    Struggling supermarket group Sainsbury also fell back after recent gains, after the Financial Times quoted a 
member of the Sainsbury family dismissing any rumours of a deal.
    The newspaper noted that Jessica Sainsbury, daughter of Sir Timothy Sainsbury, who with his wife owns 6 pct of 
the group, denied takeover rumours.
    On the second line, house builders remained higher amid hopes that the Bank of England will keep rates on hold 
when it announces the results of its November meeting on Thursday.
    Wilson Bowden was 24 higher at 989, Taylor Woodrow was 5 up at 240-1/4, Westbury up 5 at 382, and Balfour 
Beatty gained 6-3/4 pence to 283-1/4.
    But Matalan fell 2-3/4 to 225 after in-line numbers at the discount retailer failed to inspire.
    In response, Merrill Lynch reiterated its 'neutral' stance while CSFB repeated 'underperform'.
    News that RAC is to transfer its Leyland parts distribution business to the owner of Leyland Trucks drove its 
shares down 13 to 653.
    Fellow faller International Power was 1-3/4 lower at 159 after it was downgraded to 'equal-weight' from 
'overweight' at Lehman.
    Finally, Investec repeating its 'hold' rating on Tate & Lyle ahead of results this week, hit shares in the sugar 
company by 4-1/4 to 427.

Shares on Europe's leading bourses continued to trade comfortably above the gain line at noon, supported by lower 
oil prices and solid earnings reports, although investors remained wary ahead of today's US presidential elections, 
dealers said.
    At 12.00 noon, the STOXX 50 was 0.43 pct or 11.69 points higher at 2,726.82, while the STOXX 600 edged 0.42 
pct or 1.03 points higher at 243.32.
    On Wall Street, the DJIA is expected to open around 29 points higher, according to spreadbetting firm IG index, 
as investors bet on a US equity-friendly Bush victory.
    Voting starts in the US today, although there are concerns that the eventual outcome may take a while longer to 
be decided, amid reports that over 50,000 postal ballots have gone missing in Florida.
    In Europe, falling oil prices lifted investors' mood.
    At 10.05 am, US benchmark futures for December delivery were down 41 cents at 49.72 usd.
    However, this weighed on energy stocks and utilities, with investors cashing in profits in the latter sector after 
yesterday's run.
    Royal Dutch extended losses, down 0.47 pct or 0.21 eur at 42.25, while Total was still underperforming the 
broader market, up only 0.7 eur to 164.3.
    ENEL was the biggest casualty amongst utilities, falling 1.2 pct or 0.086 eur to 7.11, while E.On dropped 0.59 pct 
or 0.25 eur to 64.82.
    On the upside, a batch of positive earnings reports pleased the market.
    UBS added 2.8 sfr or 2.05 pct at 89.3 sfr, after publishing third quarter results that were broadly in line with 
expectations.
 Credit Suisse Group shares benefited from peer UBS' results, rising 0.2 sfr or 0.48 pct to 41.7.
    Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, soared 11 pct or 0.44 eur to 4.45 after Dresdner Kleinwort 
Wasserstein upgraded the shares to 'buy' from 'hold' following strong second quarter results.
    Earlier today, Ryanair reported better-than-expected second quarter profit and raised its second-half forecast for 
yields.
Euroshares firmer midday, as lower oil, good results offset US election nerves
    Assa Abloy jumped 5 skr to 101 skr after the world's biggest lock maker announced higher-than-expected third 
quarter results and hiked its outlook for 2004-2005.
    Carnegie reiterated its 'outperform' rating following what it called "great numbers".
    In France, Publicis traded 1.36 pct higher, or up 0.32 eur at 23.88 on positive expectations about the company's 
third-quarter sales due after the close today.
    Publicis is expected to announce third-quarter sales showing organic growth in line with or marginally ahead of 
the second quarter's 4.5 pct growth, analysts said.
    On the negative side, several stocks were hit by negative broker comments.
    ABN Amro shares have been downgraded by a number of brokers as yesterday's weak third-quarter report 
highlighted the poor earnings outlook for the Dutch bank.
    CAI Cheuvreux cut the shares to 'underperform' from 'outperform' and lowered the 2004 EPS estimate to 2.12 
eur from 2.16.
    They left the price target at 20 eur, saying they see very limited room for share buybacks at ABN Amro's current 
capital ratios.
    Kempen & Co also downgraded the stock, to 'neutral' from 'add'. While the valuation of the stock is still cheap, 
the growth outlook is limited, the broker said.
    Bank Oyens & van Eeghen was the third broker to downgrade the shares to 'neutral', saying the company will 
find it difficult in 2005 to make up for lost earnings from the sale of its unit LeasePlan, as well as the inclusion of 
stock options and a dollar hedging gap in results.
    ABN shed 0.01 eur to 18.67.
    DaimlerChrysler shed 0.59 pct or 0.17 eur to 32.76, after Morgan Stanley cut its 2005 EPS forecast for the 
German car maker by 9 pct to 3.10 eur, with its price objective for the stock falling to 38 eur from 44.
    However, Morgan Stanley -- which cited a deteriorating outlook for Mercedes -- continues to have an 'overweight' 
stance on DaimlerChrysler's shares.
    Philips was under pressure after Citigroup Smith Barney downgraded its recommendation on the stock to 'sell' 
from 'hold'.
    The broker also slightly cut its target price to 17 eur from 18 eur after introducing a new earnings model, as it has 
transferred coverage of Philips to new analyst Lionel Rayon, who argued earnings "are likely to be depressed in the 
next six quarters".
    Philips shares lost 0.32 pct or 0.06 eur to 18.7.

Shares in Europe's leading bourses are expected to open in positive territory, taking heart from US gains and 
easing oil prices, with volume set to remain light due to the US presidential elections, dealers said.
    Voting is due to start today, although there are concerns that the eventual outcome may take a while longer to be 
decided amid reports of over 50,000 missing postal ballots in Florida.
     The DJIA yesterday closed up 26.92 points at 10,054.39, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 4.88 points 
to 1,979.87.
    In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index ended the morning session up 115.92 points to 10,850.63, and the Hang Seng 
index began its afternoon session up 157.03 points 13,251.28.
    Crude oil prices slipped below 50 usd a barrel in Asian trading.
    At 3.25 GMT, New York's benchmark contract, light sweet crude for delivery in December, was down 23 cents to 
49.90 a barrel from its close of 50.13 usd in New York overnight.
    In Europe, investors will digest a handful of earnings reports.
    UBS said third quarter net income fell to 1.671 bln sfr from 1.974 bln in the second quarter, in line with market 
consensus.
    The Swiss bank said it expects 2004 to be "one of UBS' best years", despite the uncertainty that continues to 
weigh on financial markets and "which may again dampen levels of investor activity."
    Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, reported higher-than-expected second quarter profit.
    For the second quarter period to end September, the Dublin-based airline made a net profit of 147.6 mln eur -- 
significantly ahead of analysts' consensus forecast of 130 mln eur and versus 128.4 mln eur last time.
 It said it expects average fares to fall by 5-10 pct in the second half versus previous guidance of a decline of 10-20 
pct.
    Other companies reporting today include Fresenius Medical Care, Banco Popolare di Verona e Novara, Assa 
Abloy, and Publicis after the market close.
    Fresenius Medical Care AG delivered solid third quarter figures.
Euroshares opening - edging higher on US gains and falling oil prices
    Banco Popolare di Verona e Novara will release nine-month results, which should gain from cost cuts, said 
analysts, adding they expect a long-term business plan announcement.
    Nine months net profit is seen at 283.5-291 mln eur, against 212.9 mln a year earlier.
    Assa Abloy, the world's biggest lock maker, is set to report a sharp rise in third quarter pretax profit today, to 577 
mln skr from 467 mln skr a year earlier, according to the consensus of forecasts.
    Publicis will publish third quarter sales showing organic growth in line with or marginally ahead of the second 
quarter's 4.5 pct growth, analysts said.
    Publicis has not given guidance for full-year organic growth but Exane expects it to come in at 4.3 pct, warning it 
remains "cautious on the extent of the recovery in Europe" -- the key driver for growth.
    Elsewhere, shares in Carlsberg have been downgraded to 'neutral' from 'buy' at Merrill Lynch ahead of the 
group's third quarter results due Thursday this week.
    JP Morgan initiated coverage of Degussa shares with an 'underweight' and a 27 eur price target.
    On the data front, there is nothing significant on the agenda today, dealers said.

Wall Street outlook - U.S. stock futures higher ahead of U.S. vote - UPDATE 1

U.S. stock futures were holding moderate gains early Tuesday as America gears up for what even radio stations in 
London have taken to calling "the election."
European stocks were also showing small gains, reflecting the drop in oil futures. The active New York crude 
contract was kept under the $50 mark early Tuesday. European airline stocks were among the big gainers.
Still volumes were relatively thin in European stocks and expected to remain so until the U.S. vote takes shape. 
Underlying U.S. stocks were also not seeing a lot of trade.
The dollar was little changed against the key European currencies - last at $1.27 on the euro. A decisive victory for 
either candidate is likely to trigger a dollar rally, some currency analysts have maintained. The dollar dropped 3 
percent on a trade-weighted basis in October, partly reflecting the risk of an uncertain result.
Market activity could improve after a depressed third quarter for stocks and debt trading if a "clear" result emerges 
from the U.S. election, the chief financial officer at Swiss banking giant UBS said on Tuesday.
"Assuming there is a clear result, it is quite possible that market activity may become more buoyant, although there 
are plenty of reasons to be cautious," Clive Standish said after UBS posted its third quarter profits, AFX News 
reported from Zurich.
Standish said market activity isn't currently showing a "significant pick-up" from the third quarter. UBS equity and 
fixed income trading revenue dropped 20 percent in the third quarter.
The Dow industrials futures were up 27 points at 10,066 ahead of 8 a.m. Eastern, off its peak for the pre-open. The 
Nasdaq 100s and S&P 500 futures were each up a few points. European chip stocks were mixed after warning 
overnight from chipmaker National Semiconductor on inventories.
At 12:01 a.m. as voters in tiny Dixville Notch, N.H. gave Bush a 2-1 margin in predawn returns. Ohio may come in 
for extra scrutiny after a federal appeals court that Republicans could station thousands of people inside polling 
places to challenge the eligibility of voters.
Focus stocks
Wall Street outlook - U.S. stock futures higher ahead of U.S. vote - UPDATE 1
Shares of Finnish mobile phone maker Nokia Corp.   were up 0.3 percent in the home market. The Wall Street 
Journal overnight noted that Nokia plans to launch a handheld personal-organizer product this year. The product 
underlines the rivalry with Microsoft  .
Elsewhere in the PC stocks, Bear Stearns analysts overnight lowered its PC unit estimates for the fourth quarter, 
citing softness in the U.S. consumer. Analysts now see fourth quarter sequential growth at 16 percent, or up 13 
percent on the year. That is down from a prior projection for 19 percent sequential growth in the industry's most 
important quarter.
MSFT was a few cents higher in euro trading in Frankfurt at $28.12 in the early-going. Cisco Systems   was seeing 
small activity at $19.22, down a few cents. Trading was too thin to set a definitive trend.
Irish low-fare carrier Ryanair   predicted a "bloodbath" and "airline casualties", accelerated by record high oil prices, 
as it revealed its results for the half year. Shares soared nearly 8 percent in London trade as it said it expects 
passenger yield to fall by less than previously expected in the second half.
CGI Group  , the information technology and business process services company expects earnings growth of 25 to 
35 percent to 52 to 56 Canadian cents a share in fiscal 2005 and revenue to increase 20 to 28 percent to $3.9 
billion to $4.15 billion.
Time Warner's   America Online unit is getting ready to fire more than 700 workers next month as part of a cost-
cutting effort to combat declining subscriber numbers, the Washington Post, citing officials familiar with the matter.
Shares of Teva Pharmaceuticals   were down 0.9 percent in the early-going at $24.92. Dealers in London said cited 
negative comment from one broker, but this could not be independently confirmed.
AmerisourceBergen Corp.   reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $171.6 million, or 81 cents a share, down from 
$1.04 a share in the same period a year ago due primarily to the loss of a major customer. Revenue rose 4 percent 
to $12.1 billion from last year's $11.7 billion. The pharmaceutical services company reiterated its fiscal 2005 
forecasts for earnings of $4.20 to $4.30 and flat revenue.
Overnight, shares of National Semiconductor   fell 7.8 percent to $15.39 after it lowered its fiscal second-quarter 
financial targets due to weak demand and high inventory.
Maxim Integrated Products Inc.   fell 1.6 percent to $43.52 in the pre-open, in line with the decline overnight. It 
reported a fiscal first-quarter profit of 42 cents per share on revenue of $435.1 million. It was expected to earn 42 
cents per share on sales of $454 million.
From the brokers, Piper Jaffray cut PeopleSoft   to market-perform from outperform, saying that despite the higher 
bid from Oracle  , it believes "the risk/reward at the current price of $22.93 is less attractive."
A higher bid than the $24 per share offered by Oracle may be necessary to garner the support of the PeopleSoft 
board for a transaction. Piper said that given that the PeopleSoft board viewed the "previous $26 bid insufficient, it 
seems likely that they will recommend that shareholders reject the $24 offer."
Merrill Lynch downgraded insurance firm the Willis Group   to neutral from buy, saying that "the fundamental 
backdrop will continue to be a headwind for the company." The broker also said: "While the market appears to be 
assuming that Willis will not be accused of the type of market manipulation and bid-rigging that has been alleged 
against Marsh & McLennan   (an assumption we share), we can not rule out a scenario where other conflict-of-
interest allegations are made against Willis."

The FTSE 100 was slightly higher in thin midday trade, as lower oil prices and a positive outlook for New York 
indices countered ongoing concerns ahead of tonight's US presidential election, dealers said.
    At 11.50 am, the FTSE 100 index was up 7.0 points at 4,680.7, while the broader indices were also firmer.
    Volume was light, with 706.2 mln shares changing hands in 81,481 deals.
    Spread betting group IG Index was calling the DJIA up around 31 points after gains of 26.9 points yesterday to 
10,054.4. Support came from expectations of a US equity-friendly Bush victory and an easing of oil prices.
    Brent crude for December delivery fell 26 cents in London to 46.8 usd a barrel in electronic trading.
    In the US today, the economic focus will be on factory orders for September, seen up 0.6 pct versus a 0.1 pct 
decline in August.
    The ISM non-manufacturing index for October is expected to rise to 57.6 from 56.7 in September.
    Meanwhile, CSFB expects US vehicle sales in October to have cooled to 16.2 mln units from 17.5 mln in 
September.
    On the corporate front, investors awaited results from Amerisource Bergen, BMC Software, Citizens 
Communications and Tenet Healthcare.
    In London, relief over easing fuel prices kept shares of British Airways in positive territory, rising 3-1/4 pence to 
219-1/4.
    Fellow oil consumers ICI and Carnival meanwhile, gained 2-3/4 to 216 and 15 pence to 2,936.
    No-frills airline Ryanair was also in demand, soaring 10.7 pct, or 0.43 eur, to 4.44 after posting better than 
expected interim results and an upbeat outlook.
 Dresdner Kleinwort was bullish, upgrading the shares to 'buy' from 'hold', arguing that while there may still be 
casualties in the low cost carrier sector this winter, these figures substantially reduce the uncertainty regarding the 
competitive environment and fuel costs.
    Sector peer easyJet added 9-1/4 pence to 168-3/4.
    Back among the blue chip risers, positive broker comment supported the media sector.
London shares slightly up midday as oil price falls counter US election fears
    Pearson rose 9 pence to 610 after CSFB highlighted the better trend in financial and general advertising at the 
Wall Street Journal may help the outlook for the UK group's FT group.
    CSFB noted that the US professional publishers Dow Jones and McGraw-Hill have outperformed both Pearson 
and Reed Elsevier over the past month and the three month period.
    Reed rose 4-1/2 pence to 499.
    Among financials, Amvescap topped the FTSE leaderboard, with the shares clocking up a 6 pence gain to 306-
1/2, supported by a strengthening of the US dollar and also some positive comments from Lehman Brothers.
    In a research note today, Lehman said Amvescap shares look attractive and offer around 25 pct potential upside.
    Meanwhile, 3i Group shares gained 5 pence to 594-1/2 as the market welcomed the appointment of the group's 
new finance director Simon Ball.
    The venture capital giant is also due to post its interim results on Thursday.
    Also reporting results on Thursday, Smith & Nephew fell 10 pence to 466, as investors cautiously took profits. 
The shares have outperformed in the past few sessions following upbeat results from US sector peers.
    Other losers included struggling supermarket group Sainsbury, whose shares fell 5-1/4 to 262 after recent gains.
    This morning, the Financial Times quoted a member of the Sainsbury family dismissing any rumours of a 
takeover.
    The newspaper noted that Jessica Sainsbury, daughter of Sir Timothy Sainsbury, who with his wife owns 6 pct of 
the group, denied takeover rumours.
    Oil stocks fell back in line with a decline in crude prices -- BP down 1-1/2 at 530-1/2 and Shell off 4 at 426.
    Among the midcap fallers, RAC was the worst performer, slipping 21-1/2 pence to 644-1/2,
    Investors fretted over a possible rise in insurance regulation costs after the motoring and vehicle services group 
revealed it was 'preparing' for regulation under the terms of the Insurance Mediation Directive, which comes into 
effect in January next year.
    The group was also hit by the disclosure that the Leyland business, which it plans to offload, contributed 19 mln 
stg to the group's first half profits - higher than the 6.5 mln stg UBS had estimated.
    On the upside, house builders remained higher amid hopes that the Bank of England will keep rates on hold 
when it announces the results of its November meeting on Thursday.
    Wilson Bowden was 27 higher at 992, Taylor Woodrow was 4-3/4 up at 240, Westbury up 6-3/4 at 383-3/4, and 
Balfour Beatty gained 5-1/4 pence to 282-1/4.

(Adds detail of Ryanair's continuing appeal)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC confirmed it is to pay back 4 mln euros it received to the Walloon authorities in Belgium to 
help establish services from Charleroi arport, pending an appeal of a European Commission decision ruling the aid 
illegal.
    The company will pay the money into an escrow account until its appeal is heard and the European courts make 
a definitive decision on this matter.
 Ryanair said if it is successful in its appeal, the funds along with interest will be returned to it. If the appeal fails, the 
funds will be transferred to the Walloon authorities.
    In a statement, Ryanair reiterated its disagreement with the Commission's decision, saying it was legally flawed 
on a number of points. It has appealed to the European Court of the First Instance.
    Ryanair's head of communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
    "Ryanair is confident that the unlawful decision of the European Commission will be overturned by the European 
Court and that the Court will promote the enormously successful partnership between low fares airlines and 
regional airports".

(Updating with further details)
     Leading shares managed to close just above the gain line, as an 8 pct rise in Amvescap together with an easing 
of the oil price, offset a slide in heavyweight miners and a weak showing in New York, dealers said.
    At the close of trade in the UK, the FTSE 100 index was up 12.7 points at 4,642.8, below its early high of 4,663.4. 
The wider indices were also higher.
    Volume was strong, with 2.7987 bln shares changing hands in 223,1717 deals.
    Over on Wall Street, indices clawed back some of their earlier losses, helped by a further fall in oil prices. Profit 
takers had initially moved in at the open after hefty gains last night.
    The DJIA was down 6.38 points at 9995.62, while the Nasdaq was off 1.15 at 1,968.8.
    There was a raft of earnings releases, with strong results from ExxonMobil and Viacom, offsetting disappointing 
figures from Verizon Communications and JDA Uniphase.
    In economic news, initial jobless claims rose unexpectedly by 20,000 to 350,000 last week. Economists were 
expecting only a slight increase in initial claims to about 335,000.
    However, the four-week moving average of new claims fell by 5,500 to 343,250 in the week ending October 23, 
the lowest level in five weeks.
    Crude futures, which had tumbled 5 pct on Thursday, lost more ground, falling to a two-week low. December 
crude was last down 61 cents to 51.85 usd a barrel in New York.
 In London, Amvescap's third quarter numbers pleased, sending the shares up 23-1/4 to 298-3/4 as traders 
expressed relief that the fund manager managed to match market expectations and did not make a rights issue.
    Meanwhile, the easing of the oil price failed to dent support for Shell, as the shares jumped 11-3/4 pence to 435-
1/2.
    The Anglo-Dutch oil major announced plans for the unification of the group leading to one listed company, one 
board, one chairman, and one chief executive.
London shares close higher, as Amvescap, Shell offset a slide in miners UPDATE
    Other blue chip energy groups fell back in reaction to the easier crude price -- BP lost 6 pence to 529-1/2, while 
BG shed 3-1/2 to 352-3/4.
    Airlines staged a rally on the back of the weaker oil price however, with British Airways 89 pence higher at 214-
1/2, and Ryanair up 0.12 eur at 3.98.
    Meanwhile, investors fled the mining sector after China's central bank raised interest rates for the first time in 
more than nine years in a move to cool its fast-growing economy and put a lid on inflation.
    Xstrata was down 59 pence at 839, BHP Billiton was off 21-1/2 at 558, Rio Tinto fell 41 to 1,423, Anglo American 
lost 36 to 1,203 and Antofagasta shed 45 to 999.
    Xstrata was the worst performing blue chip miner, as dealers expressed concern the group could raise its offer 
for WMC, the Australian base metals and uranium miner, after its 7.4 bln aud bid was rejected.
    However, Cazenove said the WMC deal is seen as earnings accretive to Xstrata and advised investors to buy the 
shares on any weakness today.
    Elsewhere, GlaxoSmithKline shares reversed the morning's gains as the group's third-quarter pretax profit failed 
to inspire.
    The drugs giant posted a 10 pct fall in its pretax pre-exceptional profits to 1.52 bln stg from 1.69 for the third 
quarter, dented by the weaker dollar and a disappointing performance by its antidepressants Paxil and Wellbutrin.
    Glaxo fell 3 pence to 1,148, after hitting a high of 1,181 this morning.
    Also on the downside, shares in ICI were down 5-1/4 to 211-1/2 after cautious comments from Cazenove in the 
wake of today's top-of-the-range third-quarter results from the chemicals giant.
    Cazenove is understood to be concerned that ICI will see gross margin pressure in both the fourth quarter and 
2005.
    Elsewhere, Boots shares lost 8 pence to 663 after the health and beauty retailer reported slightly weaker-than-
expected interim results.
    Despite Boots also announcing that it would meet full-year expectations, CAI Cheuvreux said it remains cautious 
on the stock due to the fact that after recent investments group sales growth is still weak.
    Cheuvreux reiterated its 'underperform' rating on Boots.
    Whitbread also fell back, losing 20-1/2 pence at 810-1/2 as analysts mulled the group's long-awaited strategic 
review and share buyback plans which accompanied today's first-half results from the leisure group.
    While the news was welcome, many thought the divestment programme did not go far enough, while others 
questioned whether the focus on the continuing businesses, and a sharp increase in the level of capital 
expenditure, would be enough to drive returns to the sort of figure the company is looking for.
    ABN Amro moved its rating to 'hold' from 'buy'.
    Among the midcaps, traders said Morgan Crucible was outperforming -- up 9-3/4 at 152 -- after a presentation to 
Citigroup analysts went "very well".
    Elsewhere, TBI gained 0-3/4 pence to 72-1/4 as speculation of a possible bid for the airport operator returned.
    Earlier today, TBI moved to take full control of London Luton with the proposed acquisition of the remaining 28.6 
pct Alterra Interests not already owned for approximately 67.3 mln stg in cash.
    TBI also announced the completion today of the sale of Airport Group International, its airport services business 
in the US to BBA for 24 mln usd.
    In response, dealers said that things are definitely "beginning to stir" within the airport group. They argued that 
the cleaner structure at TBI's main asset makes the airport operator more attractive for a predator.
    But on the downside, Halma lost 7 to 159 after an in-line first-half trading update failed to inspire.
London shares close higher, as Amvescap, Shell offset a slide in miners UPDATE
    An unexciting trading update also weighed on software firm iSoft, with its shares down 19 pence at 380.
    Deutsche Bank, however, kept a 'buy' recommendation on iSoft, arguing that the seasonality of revenues is 
merely a "timing issue".

Europe's largest bourses moved off intra-morning highs midday with Wall St seen falling amid a new onslaught of 
earnings reports and ahead of today's September Philadelphia fed survey, dealers said.
    At 12.03 pm, the STOXX 50 was down 2.77 points at 2678.91 and the STOXX 600 was 0.01 points lower at 
238.64.
    Spreadbetting firm, IG Index, said the DJIA looks set to fall 37 points at open.
    The tech sector stole the limelight after positive earnings news.    
    And SAP gained ground after it said third quarter licence sales reached 491 mln eur, up 12 pct from 433 mln in 
the year-earlier period as software sales in Europe rose sharply.
    Analysts had expected third quarter licence sales between 440-485 mln eur.Shares climbed 1.76 thanks also to 
strong third quarter numbers overnight from Siebel Systems.
    And Alcatel climbed to the top of the STOXX 50 riser board -- up 5.23 pct -- after winning a 1.7 bln usd five-year 
deal to supply network technology and services to SBC Communications' Project Lightspeed fiber network.
    But ST Microelectronics turned 0.5 pct lower as the group's fourth quarter sales warning weighed.
    Among pharmaceuticals, Novartis added 1.05 pct after its third quarter earnings came in higher than the 
consensus forecasts. Newly formed Sanofi-Aventis fell 0.26 pct after its uninspiring numbers.
    AstraZeneca stormed off earlier lows -- up 1.75 pct -- after its well -received statement, and Schering rose 0.7 pct 
after its earnings report.
    Nestle rose 0.35 pct after its numbers.
Investors were relieved the group reiterated its full year guidance after a number of warnings from its competitors in 
recent weeks.
    And Autoliv added 0.35 after its numbers.
    But L'Oreal fell 1.6 pct as the company's in-line nine-month sales and reiteration of full-year earnings guidance 
failed to impress analysts, dealers said.

13.045 bln.
    And Lafarge fell 1.53 pct after its in-line third quarter numbers which showed a deceleration in the building 
materials group's organic growth and amid concerns about the prospects for the sector.
    A couple of sticks were also buoyed by speculation, with Easyjet up 5.21 pct amid talk Ryanair could be 
preparing a bid. But analysts saw little strategic or financial sense in such a a move.
    Indra was up 1.71 pct amid talk EADS is considering making a bid for it. EADS denied any such plans.
    On the economic front, weekly jobless claims, US August leading indicators and the US September Philadelphia 
fed survey will all likely garner some interest but may be overshadowed by the deluge of US earnings news.

STOCKWATCH Airlines in focus as Cazenove cuts EPS estimates on high oil prices
STOCKWATCH Airlines in focus as Cazenove cuts EPS estimates on high oil 
prices
AFX - Asia

Length: 316 words
Dateline: LONDON
Body
Airline stocks were in focus in early morning trade after Cazenove downgraded EPS estimates across the sector 
due to rising fuel prices, dealers said.
    In a note to clients, Cazenove argued that with Brent crude trading at about 50 usd per barrel, there is now a 
realistic possibility that fuel prices next year will be considerably higher than expected.
    Cazenove has cut EPS forecasts in 2005 for Air France SA by 40 pct, British Airways PLC by 13 pct, Deutsche 
Lufthansa AG by 15 pct and Ryanair Holdings PLC by 7 pct.
    Cazenove pointed out that airline stocks will outperform strongly should there be any notable drop in the price of 
oil, therefore they will always look tantalisingly cheap to investors persuaded that the oil price is unsustainably high.
    For those who are of this view, Cazenove recommended playing any oil price recovery through British Airways, 
Air France or Ryanair, which is currently unhedged.
    However, the broker warned it remains more cautious, not only about the possibility of the oil price falling, but 
also because of the likely impact of higher oil prices on global GDP and therefore underlying demand for air travel.
    Moreover, Cazenove has calculated that only Ryanair can be profitable with oil above 50 usd a barrel for a whole 
year.
    So, while Cazenove admitted the airline stocks do indeed look tantalisingly cheap, the broker believes that this is 
a potential value trap as long as the oil price remains so volatile.
 Hence, Cazneove thinks the sector is best avoided until there is evidence of a sustainable fall in the price of oil.
    At 8.11 am, shares in Air France were down 0.06 eur at 12.95, Lufthansa was off 0.07 at 9.58, BA was down 3 
pence at 203 and Ryanair was flat at 3.73 eur.

London shares weaker midmorning as insurance and airline stocks weigh

The FTSE 100 was weaker in midmorning trade, as the index took the strain of a slide in insurance and airline 
stocks, dealers said.
    At 9.50 am the FTSE 100 index was down 8.8 points at 4,613.9, while the broader indices were also lower.
    Volume was modest, with 264.5 mln shares changing hands in 27,036 deals.
    Over in New York, US markets are likely to open in the red, according to IG Index, at the start of another week of 
key earnings reports from blue chips companies.
    Today sees the release of third quarter results from IBM, 3M, Kraft and Texas Instruments.
    Back in London, insurance was one of the worst performing sectors as last week's news of an investigation into 
Marsh & McLennan by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer continued to spook investors.
    Prudential fell 4-1/4 to 458, Royal & Sun Alliance was off 1-1/4 at 73-1/4, Aviva dropped 6-1/2 to 540 and Legal & 
General fell 1-1/2 to 97-1/34.
    Other financial blue chips were also out of favour, with HBOS sliding 12-1/2 pence to 747-1/2 after Morgan 
Stanley downgraded its rating on the bank to 'equal-weight'.
    Morgan Stanley said the housing market has slowed sharply in the past two months, but at the same time 
remortgage activity has remained robust - a combination it sees as negative for HBOS and believes the group may 
increasingly struggle to hit market share targets.
    Meanwhile, airlines took a further hit from rising oil prices, with British Airways down 4-1/2 pence at 201-1/2, 
Ryanair off 0.01 eur at 3.72 and Easyjet slipping 1-3/4 pence to 122.
 World oil prices climbed to record highs above 55 usd a barrel in Asian trade as the supply concerns that have 
driven the market all year continued to dominate the market.
    In response to the rise in oil prices, Cazenove downgraded EPS estimates across the sector.
    Cazenove cut EPS forecasts in 2005 for Air France-KLM by 40 pct, British Airways by 13 pct, Deutsche 
Lufthansa by 15 pct and Ryanair by 7 pct.
    Elsewhere, supermarket retailers edged lower, following downbeat press comment at the weekend.
    Sainsbury fell 1 pence to 245-1/4 amid press speculation as to the stability of its pension fund.
London shares weaker midmorning as insurance and airline stocks weigh
    This morning's FT reported that the supermarket chain has increased the risk in its pension fund in a move that 
allows it to shrink its deficit and lower its contribution.
    Morrisons shed 2 pence to 191 on an FT report it is to sell up to 120 of the stores that it bought as part its 
purchase of Safeway to Somerfield for about 250 mln stg.
    The the approximate sale price is at the lower end of initial estimates, which ranged from 250-600 mln stg, said 
the FT.
    Somerfield fell 2-1/2 pence to 131-1/2.
    On a more upbeat note, BOC rallied 14-1/2 pence to 884-1/2 after the Sunday Times reported that German 
industrial giant Linde is poised to approach its British rival with an offer that could lead to an 8 bln stg cross-border 
merger.
    However, according to this morning's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, Linde said it is not in merger talks with 
BOC Group, while the UK gases group declined to comment.
    Merrill Lynch repeated its 'neutral' stance, arguing that "We'd always thought that a merger whereby existing 
shareholders received shares
in an enlarged gas group would be more likely than an outright acquisition."
    Also among the blue-chip gainers, mmO2 stood out with a rise of 2 pence to 101 after Morgan Stanley repeated 
its 'overweight' recommendation and 120 pence target.
    Vodafone also added 0-1/4 pence to 136-3/4 after the Sunday Times reported yesterday that the mobile phone 
giant will announce a big increase in its dividend next month.
    Meanwhile, shares in GUS rose 6-1/2 at 893 after Dresdner reiterated its 'buy' rating on the stock and raised its 
price target by 4 pct to 965 pence.
    Among the midcaps, Countrywide shares gained 8-1/4 pence to 293 after
acquiring Bradford & Bingley's chain of 307 estate agents and the entire issued share capital of SecureMove 
Property Services Ltd for a total of 44.4 mln stg in cash.
    In response, Panmure Gordon reiterated its 'buy' rating, saying the deal "appears financially, operationally and 
strategically compelling".
    Randgold was also in demand, boosted by news that Harmony Gold Mining is to make an offer for Gold Fields, 
the world's fourth biggest producer, in an 8.1 bln usd deal.
    Randgold added 12-1/2 pence to 590.
    SMG one of of the top midcap risers, gaining 3-1/2 pence top 113, following an article in the Business claiming 
that Chrysalis is considering making a bid for Virgin Radio as speculation mounts that SMG is preparing to sell the 
station.

Euroshares fall, Linde, BOC gases merger talk fails to offset oil price woes
Euroshares fall, Linde, BOC gases merger talk fails to offset oil price woes

Shares on Europe's main bourses moved lower in opening deals as merger hopes in the chemicals sector failed to 
offset concerns over still rising oil prices, delers said.
    At 9.03 am, the STOXX 50 was down 4.24 points at 2,686.26 and the STOXX 600 was 0.42 points lower at 
239.07.
    BOC and Linde both gained ground after weekend reports the pair are planning an 8 bln stg industrial gases 
merger.
    The two companies' senior managements, led by BOC chief executive Tony Isaac and Wolfgang Reitzle, 
president and chief executive of Linde, have met informally and come to a tacit understanding on the merits of a 
deal, the Sunday Times said.
    Merrill Lynch said the price is too high unless there are significant synergies and said 4.5 bln stg would be more 
reasonable.
    CAI Cheuvreux upgraded its rating on Linde to 'outperform' from 'underperform' on the back of the report.
    Linde shares were up 1.7 pct and BOC shares added 2.01 pct.
    ABN Amro topped the STOXX 50 risers -- up 1.36 pct -- after UBS upgraded its stance on the shares to 'buy' 
from 'neutral' and lifted its price target to 26 eur from 19 eur.
    Insurance plays will remain pressured after sharp falls Friday following news of a probe led by the Attorney 
General into commission practices in the USA.
    Munich Re fell 1.08 pct. Allianz dropped 1.22 pct.
    Elsewhere, Zurich Financial Services fell 0.78 pct after it said it expects aggregate claims payments related to the 
four recent Atlantic hurricanes of around 525 mln usd before tax and net of reinsurance.
 This corresponds to around 400 mln usd after tax and net of reinsurance, the Swiss insurer said.
    Charges for these events will be booked in the third quarter, it said.
    And airlines were lower as the still high oil prices prompted Cazenove to cut its forecasts across the board.
    Airline stocks were in focus in early morning trade after Cazenove downgraded EPS estimates across the sector 
due to rising fuel prices, dealers said.

    Cazenove has cut EPS forecasts in 2005 for Air France-KLM by 40 pct, British Airways by 13 pct, Deutsche 
Lufthansa by 15 pct and Ryanair by 7 pct. BA fell 1.46 pct, Air France-KLM was 1.46 pct lower and Lufthansa 
slipped 1.66 pct
    Norsk Hydro's third quarter numbers were mixed as the group reported very strong aluminium results but 
disappointing oil production figures.

European pilot groups are expected to announce the formation of a new union for Ryanair flight crew tomorrow, 
according to The Sunday Times.    
    The Ryanair European Pilots Association -- formed largely by the British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa), and 
its Irish counterpart Ialpa -- is aimed at giving Ryanair pilots a united voice in dealing with the company.
 Its creation is likely to enrage the no-frills airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, who has steadfastly refused to 
grant union recognition to the company's flight crew, the paper said.
    The new union, the first pan-European labour organisation to represent an individual airline's employees, will not 
immediately seek recognition for wage bargaining, but will provide a voice to air pilots' views, the paper added.

BA hikes fuel surcharges on long-haul flights by up to 8 stg from Oct 14

British Airways PLC, Europe's biggest airline by passenger capacity, hiked its fuel surcharges by up to 8 stg per 
ticket, a day after oil prices climbed to record levels.
    BA said UK passengers will from Oct 14 be asked to pay a further 4 stg on each long-haul flight, taking the total 
surcharge to 10 stg per flight, or 20 stg per return trip.
    The flag carrier in May slapped a 2.50 stg surcharge on all one-way flights, increasing it in August to 6 stg (12 stg 
per return trip) on long-haul flights.
    It added that short-haul surcharges will rise to 4 stg per flight (8 stg per return trip) from 2.50 stg (5.0 stg).
    "This is not a decision we have taken lightly but, as other airlines are finding, the continuing rise in fuel prices 
sadly makes these increases inevitable," BA's commercial director Martin George said in a statement posted on the 
company's website.
    The move mirrors increases earlier this week by a number of BA's European rivals including Deutsche Lufthansa 
AG and Air France-KLM.
    Airlines' profitability has been severely dented in recent months by a surge in the price of aviation fuel, which in 
BA's case accounts for around 11 pct of costs -- the second biggest item of expenditure after labour costs.
    BA in July estimated its annual fuel bill would rise to 1.15 bln stg this year from 922 mln a year earlier.
    It has hedged 75 pct of its fuel requirements up to March 2005.
However, with fuel prices having risen further since July that estimate may now be too low.
    Crude prices hit a record high for the third successive day Thursday, with the Nymex WTI contract for November 
delivery touching 53.00 usd for the first time in New York, a 23 pct gain in the past month.
    Europe's two biggest low-cost carriers -- Dublin-based Ryanair Holdings PLC and UK-based easyJet PLC -- on 
Tuesday reiterated their intention not to impose any fuel levy on passengers.

     British Airways PLC, Europe's biggest airline by passenger capacity, hiked its fuel surcharges by up to 8 stg per

    BA said passengers elsewhere in Europe will be charged 6 eur for a short-haul trip and 14 eur per long-haul 
ticket.
    Short-haul flights booked outside of Europe will have a 7 usd surcharge slapped on them or 17 usd per long-haul 
ticket.

(Adds detail of performance at Luton, Orlando and Stockholm operations)
     TBI PLC, the airports operator, said its first-half trading performance has been in line with its own expectations.
    During the quarter to Sept 30, the company said its total traffic increased by an average of 11 pct, with low cost 
traffic up 12 pct, charter up 1 pct and full service traffic up 7 pct.
 The six-month growth rate for its European airports was just short of 9 pct, TBI said.
    The company said that low-cost airlines easyJet and Ryanair were planning to increase activity at its London 
Luton operation, but it did not expect the benefit of any extra revenue to impact in the current year.
    Its Stockholm-Skavsta airport saw passenger traffic increase by 22 pct in the six months to the end of 
September, and TBI anticipates the airport will "at least break even at the EBITDA level" in the first half.
    It added it expected this trend to continue for the rest of this financial year.
    The company anticipated that its Orlando Sandford operation will suffer approximately 200,000 stg of lost 
revenue or extra costs as a direct result of the hurricanes which recently affected the area.
    However, it added that traffic at the airport has continued to build and its performance has been "buoyant".
    TBI said the disposal process for its non-core assets in Bolivia is now well underway, and the sale of AGI in the 
US is well advanced. The company remains confident of completing the disposals by the end of the current financial 
year.
    TBI's interim results for the six months to end-Sept will be announced on Nov 16.

(Updating with comments on EU ruling on Charleroi aid, SN Brussels/Virgin Express merger, fuel price increases)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC chief executive Michael O'Leary said the low-cost airline plans to treble the size of its fleet 
of Boeing Co 737-800 aircraft over the next 5-10 years.
    "Over the next 5-10 years we will double and treble the size of our fleet of 737-800s. We will only compete in 
those markets where we can fill 737-800s and the smaller markets we will leave to somebody else, and the bigger 
markets we will leave to somebody else," he said at a news conference.
    O'Leary said he "welcomes" the subsidies row between Airbus Industrie and Boeing Co, after the US decided to 
file a formal case with the World Trade Organization alleging that the EU gives billions of dollars in unfair state aid 
to the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co NV unit.
    "The more they're fighting the more they're competing against each other. The more there's competition between 
Airbus and Boeing, the better it is for airlines and the better for passengers," he said.
    Last year more than 10 pct of Ryanair's total costs went towards air traffic control, he said.
    "It's an enormous figure. The equivalent number in the US is zero, they don't pay for the service in the US," he 
said.
    He also said Ryanair does not plan to take advantage of future privatisations of French regional airports by 
making direct investments.
 Asked whether Ryanair would invest in regional airports he said: "If they needed financial help we would be quite 
happy to talk to them about that. But we are not investors in airports."
    "Would we buy an airport or invest in an airport? No, we'd expect the local authority or local region to develop the 
airports. We will happily put in the aircraft, the flights, the fares and the jobs," he added.
    Privatising regional airports is a "natural progression" he said, adding the "future of airports lies not in public but 
in private ownership."
    The French government has said it plans to privatise around 10 regional airports which have annual traffic over 
over 1 mln passengers.
    The government also plans to change Aeroports de Paris, the state-owned Paris airports operator, into a private 
company, paving the way for a sale of the company's stock to private investors in 2005.
Ryanair plans to triple its Boeing 737-800 fleet over 5-10 yrs UPDATE
    Ryanair is in talks with Marseille airport about establishing routes to and from the airport, he said.
    "Marseille is investing their own money into developing the low-cost facility and we're talking to them about 
developing routes to and from that facility," he said.
    O'Leary said the company has no plans to repay the 4 mln eur for the use of publicly-owned Charleroi airport 
south of Brussels that the European Commission later declared to be illegal.
    "We don't receive any subsidies for Charleroi… the decision of the EU is wrong, but we believe it will be 
overturned on appeal later this year," he said.
    "Will we give back the money? No. We will be writing back to the (European) Commission some time in the next 
three or four weeks explaining why we have no money to give them back," he said.
    Ryanair would be "delighted" if the case were fought in the Irish courts, he added.
    O'Leary said he is confident the merger between Belgian airline SN Brussels Airlines and Virgin Express will 
have "no impact" on Ryanair's business.
    "If two higher fare airlines marry in a market where we are already the lowest fare airline by some considerable 
distance, it won't have any impact on our business," he said.
    He reiterated Ryanair will not follow its rivals' lead by slapping fuel surcharges on passengers due to rising fuel 
prices.
    "We have a much lower cost base than other airlines… We are simply going to absorb the increase in fuel prices 
and make less profits this year if that's what we have to do but we won't have fuel surcharges," he said.

(Updates with Virgin Atlantic, Ryanair position)
     British Airways PLC, Europe's biggest airline by passenger capacity, admitted the level of its fuel surcharge is 
under review after oil prices earlier rocketed to a new record in New York and London.
    "We're keeping the level of the surcharge under constant review and will make adjustments where appropriate," 
a spokesman for the British flag carrier told AFX News.
    He was speaking after German rival Deutsche Lufthansa AG said it will lift its fuel surcharge 250 pct to 7 eur per 
flight from October 15.
    Airlines' profitability has been severely dented in recent months by a surge in the price of aviation fuel, which in 
BA's case accounts for around 11 pct of costs -- the second biggest item of expenditure.
    BA in July estimated its annual fuel bill would rise to 1.147 bln stg this year from 922 mln a year earlier, though it 
admits that with fuel prices having since risen further that estimate may now be too low.
    On Aug 11 it hiked its surcharge on long-haul flights to 6 stg per leg from 2.50, and to 12 stg per return flight from 
5.0.
    The surcharge on short haul flights was held at 2.5 stg.
    BA shares earlier closed down 2.25 pence, or 1.1 pct, at 207.5 pence, valuing the company at around 2.2 bln stg.
    The latest slide followed a 2.3 pct decline Tuesday which was prompted by disappointing traffic statistics and 
fresh concerns over the sky high oil price.
 Rival British-based long-haul carrier Virgin Atlantic Airways, which hiked its fuel surcharge to 6 stg per flight in 
August, like BA said its policy is under constant review.
    Europe's two biggest low-cost carriers -- Dublin-based Ryanair Holdings PLC and UK-based easyJet PLC -- 
reiterated their intention not to impose any fuel levy on passengers.

A group of European low-cost airlines wrote to the European Commission yesterday arguing that debt restructuring 
given to Alitalia by the Italian government amounts to illegal state aid, according to a report in the Financial Times, 
which does not cite sources.
    The group of companies includes Ryanair Holdings PLC, AirBerlin, Wizz Air and Valreweb, who complain that 
any shift of liabilities between the company's ground service unit AZ Service and its flying operations AZ Fly would 
be tantamount to state aid, the Financial Times reported.
 According to the report, in their letter to transport commission Loyola de Palacio and competition commissioner 
Mario Monti, they warned that "any form of state aid to Alitalia will be subject to an official challenge", most likely 
through court action.
    The latest plan by the Italian government is to split the company into two units, ground service and flying 
operations, and recapitalise the flying operations.
    Nothing is known about the future of the company's 1.63 bln eur debt, the FT said.
    Italian unions have accepted that 3,700 workers will lose their jobs, and have agreed with Alitalia chief executive 
Giancarlo Cimoli that the Italian state will retain a strong presence in AZ Service, the FT said.
    Unions and the government reached an agreement overnight on unemployment benefits for the staff that will be 
made redundant, news agency ANSA reported citing union sources.

(Corrects to show that flights to Riga are starting on Oct 31 and not Oct 1)
     Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, which is starting flights to the Latvian capital Riga on Oct 31, said it is 
looking at introducing flights to Lithuania next year.
    "We are looking at two airports in Lithuania, which have potential and are evaluating and analyzing the situation," 
said Berner Berger, head of new flights development department at Ryanair.
 "But it is very important that the Lithuanian government ensures that costs are low because economic development 
could go faster if the country is accessible," Berger added.
    Today Berger met Vilnius Mayor Arturas Zuokas, the vice mayor of the second-largest city Kaunas and Deputy 
Transport Minister Valdemaras Salauskas to discuss Ryanair's future in Lithuania.
    Salauskas said, after meeting with Berger, that Ryanair intended to begin services to Lithuania from September 
2005 and planned to carry 200,000 passengers a year.
    The airline plans to offer flights from Kaunas to seven European cities, including London, Frankfurt and Rome, he 
added.

 It added that the airlines likely to be affected include easyJet, Ryanair, Continental and Emirates.
    Aircraft re-fuellers at London's main airport Heathrow are set to walk out for 48 hours on Friday.
    That stoppage threatens to cause disruption to flights operated by, among others, British Airways PLC, Virgin

Budget airline Tiger Airways said it has plans to fly to China in the next two to three years as it expands its 
operations in the region.
    "Southern China is in, but maybe in the medium to long-term," Tiger Airways chief executive officer Patrick Gan 
told reporters covering the airline's inaugural flight to Bangkok this morning.
    All destinations within four hours' flying time from Singapore are being considered, he said. This means almost all 
countries in Southeast Asia.
    Gan said Tiger Airways intends to be the leader in the budding low-cost carrier industry.
    Tiger Airways launched a promotional campaign that offered a one-way flight from Singapore to Thailand for 1.00 
sgd. Thai Airways and SilkAir responded by offering limited tickets to the same destination at even lower fares.
    "We led the market with our 1.00 sgd fare offer to Bangkok, Phuket and Hatyai. We have set an aggressive pace, 
and our competitors have since tried to play catch-up," Gan said in a statement.
    Commenting on the 0.29 sgd fare offered by Thai AirAsia, Gan said that at that price, the cost of operations will 
be "too expensive" for the Malaysian-Thai joint venture.
    Given the tough competition among low-cost carriers, Gan said investors will need to have adequate resources 
to ensure survival.
    He said Tiger Airways has crafted a business plan that prepares it for any eventuality.
    Tiger Airways said it expects to have carried some 200,000 passengers by end-2004 and to be profitable in its 
first year of operations.
 The airline, which offers three daily flights to Bangkok and one daily flight each to Phuket and Hatyai, said it will fly 
to up to 10 destinations by the end of its first year and up to 15 destinations in its second year.
    Singapore Airlines holds a 49 pct stake in Tiger Airways, while the Singapore government's investment arm, 
Temasek Holdings, owns 11 pct.
    Tony Ryan, the founder of European low-cost airline Ryanair, and US private investors Indigo Partners are the 
other shareholders in the venture.
    Minister of State for Finance and Transport Lim Hwee Hua, who was the guest of honor at Tiger Airways' 
inauguration ceremony, encouraged low-cost carriers to compete to offer the lowest fares.
Singapore 's Tiger Airways plans to fly to China in two to three years
    "I think consumers should enjoy this for as long as they last," she said.
    Changi Airport, in a bid to further reduce costs for budget airlines, is set to construct a new terminal for low-cost 
carriers which is scheduled for completion in 2006.
    Lim said she already had a commitment from Tiger Airways to use the terminal, and that she will be more than 
happy to accommodate any other budget airline.

The Belgian government has told Ryanair Holdings PLC to repay 4 mln eur in illegal government aid within a month, 
a European Commission spokesman said.
    The demand was contained in a letter from the Belgian government to the Irish low-cost airline, of which a copy 
was sent to the commission, said Amador Sanchez Rico, a spokesman for Transport Commissioner Loyola de 
Palacio.
 "The Belgian authorities have reclaimed the money. We can only welcome that," Rico said, adding however that it 
is "very difficult" to say when they money actually will be repaid.
    The commission ruled last February that Ryanair must repay part of the aid it was given to encourage it to use 
Charleroi airport south of Brussels, but did not say how much or when.
    Although Ryanair has appealed the ruling, that does not free it from having to pay up first. But its chief executive 
Michael O'Leary has already said he will refuse to do so.
    The 4 mln eur figure confirms estimates from the Charleroi airport management.

A Belgian minister called yesterday on the Irish budget airline Ryanair to repay some of the aid it received for the 
use of Charleroi airport that the European Commission later declared to be illegal.
    The minister in charge of airports for the Walloon region Andre Antoine said he would write to the airline's 
management to remind them of their obligations.
 "When the policeman tells you to pay a fine, then that's what you have to do," Antoine said on RTL-TVI television.
    Charleroi airport chief Laurent Jossart said last Wednesday that the airline would be asked to pay back around 4 
mln eur following a ruling by the European Commission last February that some of the aid paid to Ryanair by the 
publicly-owned airport south of Brussels amounted to illegal state aid.
    Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary hinted in the British media Thursday that he might not repay the aid.
    The airline unsuccessfully appealed the ruling in May at the European Court of Justice.
    Its sales director David Gering said at a press conference in Brussels Wednesday that he saw "enormous 
potential" in the Charleroi airport if Ryanair could reach an agreement with the Walloon authorities and the airport 
on a new schedule of airport services fees.

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair will this week call for an emissions trading system to be imposed on the aviation 
industry, the Sunday Times reported today.
    Blair will make the call in a speech to Prince Charles Business and the Environment charity Tuesday and will say 
that aviation is growing so rapidly it will soon become a major emitter of greenhouse gases, the paper said.
 Introducing such a system may add 2 stg or more to the cost of an average one-way trip to Europe, it said.
    Blair will push for airlines to join a EU-wide carbon emissions trading scheme that is being introduced for 
manufacturing and other heavy industries from January, the Sunday Times said. Aviation is currently exempt.
    Blair's call is the first serious challenge to the rapid growth of low-cost airlines, who could be adversely affected 
as a new charge would represent a greater proportion of their average fares.
    Ryanair Holdings PLC has in the past condemned the proposed introduction of emissions trading, but EasyJet 
PLC, its rival, has come out in favour.
    British Airways PLC said it strongly supported the introduction of emissions trading.
    "We take the view that the issue of climate change needs to be addressed, and emissions trading is by far the 
best method of doing that, said Andrew Sentance, BA's chief economist.
    BA already participates in an emissions trading scheme.

(Updating with Tiger Airways CEO comment)
     Singapore Airlines unit SIA Engineering Co Ltd said it has secured a five-year contract worth 110 mln sgd to 
provide maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services to budget carrier Tiger Airways.
    SIA Engineering said it beat international aerospace competitors from Europe and Asia in a closed tender for the 
provision of MRO services to the airline's fleet of Airbus A320s.
 Tiger Airways is 49 pct owned by Singapore Airlines, while 11 pct is held by the Singapore government's 
investment arm, Temasek Holdings, and the remainder by Tony Ryan, the founder of European low-cost airline 
Ryanair, and US private investors Indigo Partners.
    Besides MRO services, covering light and heavy airframe maintenance as well as component overhaul, the 
contract also includes fleet and inventory technical management, SIA Engineering said.
    "Through this agreement, we are assured of the highest quality engineering services and planes maintained to 
world-class standards," said Tiger Airways chief executive officer Patrick Gan.
    "This, in turn, will translate to operating cost efficiencies, and provide the platform for Tiger to offer the lowest 
possible fares to our passengers on a sustainable basis," Gan said.
    Tiger Airways, which received its first A320 in July and took delivery of its second aircraft on Aug 15, said earlier 
that it will receive another two in December -- and four each in 2005 and 2006.

(updates with trade union leader, Ryanair comments)
     Alitalia SpA expects to book a full year operating loss of 398 mln eur, widening from 379.5 mln in 2003, Radiocor 
news agency reported, citing Alitalia's 2005-2008 business plan.
    In 2005, the plan targets an operating loss of 135 mln eur, followed by a profit in 2006 of 179 mln, it said.
    Alitalia said at the end of August that it expects a full year net loss similar to the 519.7 mln eur of 2003.
    Meanwhile, talks are continuing between management and trade unions on proposals to cut 5,000 jobs, saving 
315 mln eur a year.
    Speaking at an Alitalia shareholder meeting in Rome, chairman and CEO Giancarlo Cimoli said an agreement 
with trade unions on job cuts and new contracts has to be completed by Sept 15.
    Repeating this deadline, set previously, Cimoli said this is "a prerequisite for saving the company".
    Agreement on the plan will lead to Alitalia taking up a 400 mln eur state-backed bridging loan, and carrying out a 
capital increase during the first months of 2005, he said.
    "Taking these steps is required to overcome the very serious financial crisis of the company," he said.
    The business plan foresees cost-cutting and restructuring during 2005-2006, followed by a relaunch in 2006-
2008, he said.
    The plan aims at "recovering profitability… in order to avoid scenarios such as liquidation," he said.
    In separate comments, CGIL trade union secretary general Guglielmo Epifani said reaching an agreement with 
Alitalia will be "difficult", adding he intends to meet other union leaders later today.
 "We continue to sit at the negotiating table and we will make our points, which are not exactly those in the plan. For 
now there are no openings in the position of the company," he said.
    Speaking at a Rome news conference on route launches, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said he would be ready 
to hire pilots laid off by Alitalia so long as they are ready to fly more hours.
    The pilots would have to be ready to fly at least 815 hours per year, against the 400 flown by Alitalia, he said, 
adding they would earn 52,000 eur a year, against 38,000 at Alitalia.

BA signals Europe's airline industry set for fresh consolidation
BA signals Europe's airline industry set for fresh consolidation

Europe's troubled airline industry appears set for a further bout of consolidation after British Airways signalled it is 
on the lookout for potential acquisitions after selling its stake in Australia's Qantas.
    Europe's second biggest airline by market value, which expects the 18.25 pct stake to fetch "not less than" 1.09 
bln aud (roughly 425 mln stg), said it will use the proceeds firstly to cut its 5.6 bln stg debt mountain.
    But tellingly it added: "A strong balance sheet will place British Airways in a robust position for any future 
European consolidation."
    Broker Merrill Lynch said that is likely to be interpreted by some in the market as evidence that a deal with 
Spanish flag carrier Iberia is on the cards.
    Chief executive Rod Eddington ruled out a bid for stricken Italian carrier Alitalia but did little to douse speculation 
he may pounce on Iberia or another European airline such as Ireland's Aer Lingus.
    "It's a good relationship (with Iberia) … We've always made the point we regard them as absolutely key to our 
European plans," Eddington said.
    BA owns nearly 10 pct of Iberia's shares and has two members on the Spanish group's board.
    The two companies are members of the world's second biggest alliance Oneworld, which also includes American 
Airlines and Aer Lingus.
    Eddington's comments propelled Iberia's share price sharply higher with the shares hitting a high of 2.37 euros, 
before slipping back to stand 2 cents, or 0.9 pct, up on the day at 2.32 euros by 11:50 am in Madrid.
 Speculation that Europe's airline industry is poised for consolidation has been rife ever since Air France created 
Europe's biggest airline in revenue terms by buying Holland's KLM earlier this year.
    European flag carriers, many of which are still controlled by the state, have racked up huge losses in recent 
years as they grapple with a prolonged downturn in long-haul travel caused by the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the SARS 
outbreak and Iraq war.
    Their misery has been further compounded by fierce competition from no-frills carriers such as Ryanair and 
easyJet.
    Though passenger numbers are now back to pre-9/11 levels, soaring energy prices have heaped more pressure 
on the industry, leaving the likes of Alitalia teetering on the verge of collapse.
BA signals Europe's airline industry set for fresh consolidation
    With balance sheets stretched, analysts believe further mergers are inevitable as airlines try to strip out fixed 
costs.
    At 10.50 am in London, BA shares were trading down 2.5 pence at 233.5.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair Holdings PLC, has defended the company's salary policy to Swedish 
trade unions who are demanding that the no-frills airline sign a collective agreement, Agence France Presse 
reported.
    "Our employees earn more, and have better conditions than if we signed a collective agreement.
High productivity and high salaries, that's the key to our success," O'Leary told a press conference in Stockholm 
this afternoon.
     For several months now, the international transport union ITF has been collecting staff complaints against 
Ryanair from the 17 European countries where it operates.
    Swedish trade union HTF claims that Ryanair pays its employees much lower salaries than they would receive in 
Sweden, and can make them work 64 hours a week on 20 days of holiday a year -- while Swedish collective 
agreements limit the working week to 38.5 hours and allows workers 25 days a year of holiday.
    "It wouldn't cross our minds to threaten our employees or stop them from joining a trade Union," O Leary said.
    "But we tell them that we'll pay them more if they negotiate with us directly."

- U.S.-listed shares of European companies ended higher Thursday, as strength in banks and oil-sensitive energy 
and airline stocks offset weakness in the technology sector.
U.S. stock markets ended mixed as investors weighed the impact of a moderation in oil prices, which fell for a fifth 
day in a row, a truce in the Iraqi city of Najaf and disappointing financials from some companies.
The Bank of New York European ADR Index rose 0.39 points to 106.65.
Air France-KLM   rose 1.6 percent and British Airways was up 0.9 percent. Discount rival Ryanair   was 0.1 percent 
lower.
Among energy shares, British Petroleum   rose 0.5 percent, Total   climbed 0.8 percent and Royal Dutch/Shell   was 
up 0.7 percent.
The only oil majors losing ground were Repsol  , and Statoil  , both down about 0.1 percent.
Banks were mostly up, led higher by Credit Suisse Group  , up 1.2 percent; UBS  , up 1.1 percent; and Bank of 
Ireland  , 1.3 percent higher. Losers included Deutsche Bank  , down 0.7 percent, and San Paolo IMI  , off 0.5 
percent.
But much of the technology sector was mixed or weaker. Fixed-line communications shares gains at Hellenic 
Telecom  , Telenor   and Telekom Austria   were offset by losses at Deutsche Telekom  , Telefonica   and France 
Telecom  .
Semiconductors were mostly down, tracking their U.S. peers, which fell after analysts made negative comments 
about the sector. STMicroelectronics   dropped 0.2 percent, ASML Holdings   fell 1.1 percent and Infineon   was 0.1 
percent lower.
ASM International   rose 0.4 percent and Dialog Semiconductor   climbed 3.5 percent in light volume.
Software shares were generally lower and wireless communications were mixed.

Budget carrier Tiger Airways, which has just received its air operator's certificate from the Singapore authorities, 
said it will make its maiden flight to Thailand next month.
    Tiger Airways chief executive officer Patrick Gan said the airline will fly to Bangkok, Phuket and Hatyai, and ticket 
sales will start by early September.
    Gan said 80 pct of its tickets will be sold via the Internet, while the remainder will be sold through travel agencies 
and call centers.
    He added that the airline plans to be flying to up to three countries by the end of this year, up to 10 within next 
year, and up to 15 by the end of 2006.
    Gan declined to reveal the specific countries, but said that China is a possible destination.
    "I can tell you that China is within our scope. We'll eventually fly there," he said.
    Gan said that Tiger Airways' "average lowest fares" will be at least 40 pct lower than those charged by other 
airlines.
    "I suppose whether a price war breaks out depends on the other carriers who are already flying there (Thailand)," 
Gan said.
    "Tiger will be ready for any price war if it breaks out," he added.
    Tiger Airways, which received its first Airbus A320 in July, said it took delivery of its second aircraft on Aug 15.
    Gan said that it will receive another two in December -- and four each in 2005 and 2006.
    "This means that we've the newest fleet of aircraft among the low cost carriers," Gan said,
    Gan said he expects Tiger Airways to be profitable within the first year of operations, to secure up to 200,000 
customers by the end of this year and to grow by 25-35 pct in each of the next five years.
 Asked if the airline is looking at imposing a fuel surcharge on its tickets given the surge in oil prices, Gan said: 
"There'll a point whereby we will reconsider whether we'll put in the surcharge," adding that the airline will not 
impose the surcharge yet.
    He said that airline has "sufficient funding" for the next 2-3 years.

(Updates with further quotes from CEO on fuel prices, BAA dispute)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC warned that if oil prices stay at around their current high level it could wipe up to 40 mln 
eur from annual profits but Europe's biggest budget airline insisted it would not follow its rivals' lead by slapping fuel 
surcharges on passengers.
    Chief executive Michael O'Leary told reporters at a press conference that while the group was currently hedged 
at an oil price of just below 30 usd per barrel, once its hedge expires in October it will be forced to buy fuel at 
market levels, currently about 40 pct above that level.
    "If we were to hedge at current levels that would cost us an extra 40 mln euros in a full year," O'Leary said.
    But he said since he was hopeful fuel prices would fall next year the airline would not be hedging its exposure to 
fuel prices at the present market rate.
    Even if oil prices doubled Ryanair would still be "substantially profitable" and the only profitable airline in Europe, 
O'Leary said.
    He said with the airline expecting to deliver profit of between 200-215 mln eur in the year to March 2005, it would 
be able to sustain the impact of higher fuel costs without resorting to surcharges unlike a number of its rivals.
    Air France, its KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV unit and British Midland Airways Ltd all hiked fares yesterday citing 
higher fuel costs, while British Airways last month imposed its second levy in the space of three months.
 O'Leary went on to confidently predict the airline would win its legal battle in the High Court with airports operator 
BAA PLC over unpaid landing charges, adding that there was little prospect of a settlement being reached out of 
court.
    "BAA is not an organisation that generally is interested in compromise," he said.
    He was speaking as Ryanair announced it will offer as many as 900,000 seats at 90 pence one-way to celebrate 
carrying 90 mln passengers.

State airline Aer Lingus plans to reduce its workforce by 1,325 to 2,668, losing around one third of its staff over the 
next three years, according to a new business plan published today.
    Chief executive Willie Walsh said effective delivery of the strategic, commercial and financial elements of the plan 
was "essential" to ensure the continuing viability and growth of the company.
    He said the airline was operating in a highly competitive, low fares environment.
    "There is no option but to face up to this market reality and act decisively."
    Three different types of voluntary redundancy schemes are to be offered to staff which the company said would 
each represent at least nine weeks pay per year of service with a minimum offer of 40,000 eur.
    The terms will be on offer from tomorrow with Sept 14 being the closing date for applications.
    "We anticipate that there will be considerable interest in the scheme," Walsh said.
    Since Aer Lingus's survival was threatened following the downturn in the wake of the Sept 11, 2001 attacks on 
the US it has been repositioning itself as a low-fares airline.
    Average fares have dropped by almost a third since 2001 after it shed 2,000 jobs, brought in a pay freeze and 
implemented a major cost-saving plan.
    The new plan says that Aer Lingus currently has 1,540 passengers per employee compared to 12,500 for 
Ryanair and 5,900 for easyJet. The new staff cuts would mean that there would be 3,497 passengers per employee 
by 2007.
 Earlier this week, the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU) which represents 2,400 Aer 
Lingus staff, voted by over 90 pct to take action if necessary to protect jobs.
    SIPTU national industrial Secretary Michael Halpenny said no convincing case had been made by the company 
for radical jobs cuts.
    "It could hardly be otherwise when even the company recognises that this is not a survival situation and where 
Aer Lingus is expected to make around 100 million euros profit this year, thanks to the sacrifices of the workforce."
    He said the airline's workforce was now less than half what it was a decade ago.

introduce passenger fuel surcharges, unlike the recent moves by rival European operators including British Airways 
PLC.
 Michael O'Leary told reporters at a press conference that while the group was currently hedged against oil price 
increases, once this expired profits could be hit by around 40 mln eur a year. However, he was adamant that the 
group would not impose fuel surcharges on its customers.

- U.S.-listed shares of European companies took part in the broad market rally Wednesday, with Elan and 
LastMinute.com providing much of the pop.
The Bank of New York European ADR Index finished the perky trading session up less than 1 percent at 106.44.
Irish drugmaker Elan   was the group's biggest winner and one of the NYSE's most active, up 7 percent to $21.96. 
Elan and Biogen Idec   overnight said they would delay presenting data on their multiple sclerosis drug Antegren.
Elsewhere, the rally in online travel agents continued with LastMinute.com   taking the runner-up spot among the 
session's biggest winners, surging nearly 7 percent at $11.25.
Ebookers.com  , which spurred the initial jump with strong results on Monday, added 4.2 percent to close at $5.74.

Ericsson   moved similarly higher to close at $26.30.
Over in the airline sector, Air France   managed a 3.4 percent rise to $15.57 despite a downgrade from Citigroup 
Smith Barney from "buy" to "hold." The carrier is increasing fares by 12 euros for long-haul flights starting Aug. 24 
to reflect rising fuel costs, AFX News reported.

easyJet PLC aims to cut costs significantly next financial
year through the introduction of new, more cost-effective aircraft and by
improving operations within the company and at airports, CEO Ray Webster told
WirtschaftsWoche magazine in an interview.
    He said easyJet will continue to grow its business by more than 20 pct a
year.
 Webster reiterated that the Luton-based no-frills airline's outlook for the
current full year to end-September remains unchanged. It has forecast full-year
pretax profit will "at least" match the 52 mln stg achieved last year.
    Webster said the airline's operating margin, currently around 6 pct, will
improve at the expense of rival Ryanair Holdings PLC.
    The more flights easyJet or others offer from big airports like Cologne or
Dortmund, the less people will be inclined to travel to Ryanair's German hub at
Hahn to save a few euros, he said.

ROUNDUP - BA hikes fuel surcharge; Q1 ahead of consensus
ROUNDUP - BA hikes fuel surcharge; Q1 ahead of consensus

Shares in British Airways PLC were nearly 6 pct lower in afternoon trading after the flag carrier confirmed it is hiking 
the fuel surcharge on long-haul flights due to the recent surge in oil prices, warned its current year fuel bill will rise 
by 225 mln stg and reiterated its cautious outlook despite reporting first-quarter profits above consensus market 
hopes.
    Chief executive Rod Eddington said he still hoped to avoid a damaging strike by baggage handlers and check-in 
staff this summer and played down weekend reports he has set a date for his resignation.
    With effect from Aug 11, BA is increasing the surcharge on long-haul flights from the 2.50 stg per flight leg 
imposed in May to 6.0 stg per flight leg, or from 5.0 stg to 12.0 stg on return flights. The short-haul fuel surcharge of 
2.50 stg per flight remains unchanged.
    Jet fuel accounts for some 12 pct of BA's total costs, second only to labour costs. Last week Brent crude in 
London hit 41.5 usd a barrel, a 14-year high.
    The airline cautioned that its fuel bill for the year to end-March 2005 is likely to rise by 225 mln stg to about 1.1 
bln stg, some 75 mln stg above guidance issued in May.
    BA anticipates the fuel surcharges will contribute 70 mln stg to these costs. It has hedged 72 pct of its fuel up to 
March 2005 at about 32 usd a barrel.
    A spokeswoman for Virgin Atlantic, the rival UK long-haul carrier, said its fuel surcharges were "under review".
 However, the low-cost sector lambasted BA's move. Both Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC reiterated that 
they will not introduce surcharges.
    "BA are nothing more than a bunch of price gougers, ripping off consumers with high fares and surcharges," said 
Paul Fitzsimmons, Ryanair's head of communications.
    easyJet said in a statement it does not believe fuel surcharges work, arguing that putting fares up simply reduces 
demand. It accused BA of "cynically" discriminating against its long-haul customers, avoiding increasing its fares in 
its most competitive market -- Europe.
    For the three months to end-June BA made an operating profit of 150 mln stg compared to analysts' expectations 
of 95-160 mln stg, with a consensus of 125 mln stg, and 40 mln stg in the same period last year -- a period 
weakened by the Iraq war and the SARS epidemic.
ROUNDUP - BA hikes fuel surcharge; Q1 ahead of consensus
    First-quarter capacity increased 3.4 pct and traffic was up 7.9 pct, giving a load factor -- passengers as a 
proportion of the number of seats available -- of 74.9 pct, up 3.1 percentage points. However, yields (average fares) 
fell 4.5 pct.
    BA's operating margin was 7.8 pct, still way off management's holy grail of 10 pct.
    Pretax profit came in at 115 mln stg compared to analyst expectations of 70-135 mln stg, with a consensus of 
100 mln stg, versus a pretax loss of 45 mln stg last time.
    The improved performance reflected a 5.1 pct increase in revenue to 1.93 bln stg, a 0.9 pct reduction in total 
costs and a 9.1 pct improvement in unit costs.
    The airline cut its net debt to 3.8 bln stg, down 334 mln stg since the start of the financial year.
    "These are reasonable results but currently fuel and employee costs remain our biggest challenges," said 
Eddington.
    In addition to the forecast rise in fuel costs, higher pension contributions of 133 mln stg a year are driving the 
increase in staff costs, which rose 4.4 pct in the quarter.
    BA's outlook on market conditions has remained unchanged for seven months -- long-haul premium (first and 
business class) volumes recovering steadily, but short-haul premium travel remaining at lower levels and non-
premium volumes very price-sensitive.
    It is still forecasting a revenue improvement of 2-3 pct in the current year with yield declines more than offset by 
increased volume.
    "We don't see airlines having any pricing power in the market so our view broadly of outlook hasn't changed," 
Eddington told AFX News.
    "That's why we make the point that maintaining fiscal constraints on our costs is the only way to ensure we 
remain robust. We don't see any signs looking forward through the rest of the year of market conditions changing 
materially."
    The CEO flagged that with the short-haul market "ferociously competitive" the airline's short-haul business will 
not return to profit this year.
    "We know the journey for us with our short-haul business isn't over, that we've got to continue to take costs out if 
we are going to stay in the game. We intend to do that," he said.
    "It's going to be tough, we will not be making money short haul this year. I think that's pretty clear."
    Merrill Lynch, BA's joint house broker, provisionally reduced its current-year operating profit forecast to 450 mln 
stg from 533 mln stg and its earnings per share estimate to 20.0 pence from 24.4 pence to take account of the new 
fuel-related guidance.
    Eddington said the Transport and General Workers Union and the GMB union have not yet responded formally to 
management's offer of binding arbitration with an independent third party to settle a long-running pay dispute.
    "We've had no formal response at all," he said.
    However, last week both the TGWU and GMB issued press releases rejecting BA's offer. Both unions said they 
will continue to seek a resolution to the dispute but are also balloting members for possible strike action.
    Both unions have rejected BA's offer of an 8.5 pct wage rise over three years, or 10.5 pct, if no money is put into 
pensions.
    Eddington said the third union involved in the dispute, Amicus, has indicated it will accept BA's offer of binding 
arbitration.
    The three unions represent some 8,300 baggage handlers and check-in staff at Heathrow, Gatwick, Birmingham, 
Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports.
ROUNDUP - BA hikes fuel surcharge; Q1 ahead of consensus
    Eddington said the offer of arbitration is "the sensible and reasonable way forward to get an opportunity to 
resolve our differences without disrupting our customers."
    In July 2003 a wildcat strike by BA's Heathrow check-in staff over the introduction of an electronic swipecard 
clocking-on system cost the airline 40 mln stg, reflecting costs incurred and lost revenue -- about 500 BA flights 
were cancelled and 100,000 passengers disrupted.
    Meanwhile, Eddington moved to play down speculation he has set a date to resign from BA.
    "Let me quash this rumour that I'm about to leave… I've still got a couple of laps in me, I hope," he said.
    Reports over the weekend suggested Eddington, CEO since April 2000, is planning to quit at the end of next year 
for personal reasons.
    "I haven't put any dates in the diary," he insisted.
    "For me there are a whole bunch of issues that will decide when I leave, not just business issues.
    "I've said before this is the only job I want to do and it's certainly my last executive job and I'll do it as long as I 
can… My focus is very much on this year as well as next."
    By 1.08 pm BA shares, which fell 13-3/4 pence on Friday, were down 12-1/4 pence at 200-3/4, valuing the airline 
at 2.17 bln stg.

(Updating to add further details)
     Leading shares were lower in morning trade, but off earlier lows, with confidence dented by oil price inspired falls 
on Wall Street overnight, which saw the DJIA suffer its biggest one-day fall in five months, dealers said.
    At 09.10 am, the FTSE 100 was down 23 points at 4,390.4, off lows of 4,370, in line with the wider market. 
Volume was relatively slight with 251 mln shares changing hands.
    Last night the DJIA closed down 163.48 points, or 1.6 pct, at 9,963.03 -- its biggest one-day point fall since 
March.
    Oil prices continued to spook the market, with Brent crude futures hitting yet another all-time high in pre-open 
trading amid concerns over supply.
    At 8.45 am, the front month Brent futures contract was up 28 cents at 41.40 usd, off a high of 41.50 usd minutes 
earlier.
    Meanwhile, also in pre-opening trade, benchmark crude in New York was up 14 cents at 44.55 usd.
    On the economic front, the publication of US nonfarm pay rolls for July will garner the most attention
    Analysts expect the US figures to show an increase of 230,000, against a rise of 112,000 in the previous month.
    Meanwhile in London the spiralling price of crude dominated share price movements, underpinning strength in 
the oil sector.
    BP and Shell outperformed the market, 1/2 easier at 510-1/4 and down 2 at 397, respectively.
    Second line peers, Tullow Oil, up 1/2 at 117-1/2 and Paladin Resources, 1-1/4 higher at 130, also benefited.
 But on the downside, chemical groups suffered, with ICI down 4-1/2 at 227-3/4 and BOC down 14 at 898-1/2.
    British Airways hovered near the top of the FTSE fallers, down 6 at 220-3/4 as traders fretted over the rising cost 
of fuel.
    These fears also hit BA's low-cost rivals with easyJet falling 2-1/2 at 139-1/2, despite the airline reiterating full-
year guidance, and Ryanair down 0.8 eur at 4.31.
    Amid the losses, traders flocked for comfort in defensive stocks, with pharmas being the big winners.
London shares down in morning trade, off lows, on new oil price highs UPDATE
    Drug firms Smith & Nephew, up 9 at 490, Alliance Unichem, up 1 at 658 and Shire Pharma, 1/2 higher at 459-3/4 
dominated a very sparse blue chip risers board.
    Alongside them though was Barclays, buoyed by speculation Citigroup are poised to make a 7 stg a share bid for 
the UK bank, but dealers are doubtful.
    Nonetheless Barclays was 33-3/4 pence higher at 515.
    Vodafone was under pressure after the mobile phone giant published a disappointing set of Japanese subscriber 
numbers overnight, dealers said.
    Vodafone's Japanese unit announced that it lost 3,100 subscribers in the month of July, hit by a high number of 
disconnects and new products from KDDI and NTT DoCoMo.
    Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein noted that this is the first time Vodafone Japan has gone into the red and said it 
had hoped for better performance from new 2G handsets introduced in June and July.
    Its shares were down 1-3/4 at 118-1/4.
    On the corporate news front Bradford & Bingley heralded the end of the banking reporting season by reporting in-
line interim figures.
    In response, Merrill Lynch reiterated its 'sell' recommendation voicing concern over second-half margins.
    The mortgage lender and financial services group posted pretax profit for the half year ending June 30 up 5 pct to 
140.0 mln stg, and said its non-core disposal programme is progressing well.
    Its shares rose 3/4 at 270.
    Another gainer was Dignity, up 8 at 283, after the UK's largest funeral services company disclosed a 31 pct 
increase in first-half underlying pretax profits despite a 3.6 pct fall in the death rate from the same period last year.

ROUNDUP Ryanair cautious on outlook as Q1 profits rise 21 pct
ROUNDUP Ryanair cautious on outlook as Q1 profits rise 21 pct

Body
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, has reported a 21 pct increase in first-quarter profit after 
tax, a touch above market expectations, but has reiterated its cautious outlook for the balance of the year.
    For the three months to June 30 the Dublin-based airline, which operates 161 routes across 17 countries with a 
fleet of 72 aircraft, made a profit after tax of 53.1 mln eur, up from 43.8 mln eur last time, with a 6 pct decline in 
yields (average fares) offset by passenger growth of 28 pct to 6.6 mln.
    The outcome also benefited from a weak comparative. In the first quarter last year Ryanair acquired Buzz, the 
low-cost unit of KLM. During April 2003 Buzz was closed while management restructured its routes and operations, 
re-opening in May.
    Adjusted profit after tax of 52.5 mln eur versus 40.5 mln eur last time excludes the non-recurring costs of the 
Buzz re-organisation in April 2003 of 2.7 mln eur and goodwill charges of 0.6 mln eur in both the quarters ended 
June 30 2003 and 2004.
    First-quarter revenue increased 23 pct to 302.8 mln eur, while basic earnings per share rose to 7.0 cents from 
5.8.
    The 6 pct yield decline reflected intense competition throughout Europe in the no-frills sector but was towards the 
lower end of Ryanair's guidance of a fall of 5-10 pct, which it has maintained for the second quarter.
    For the winter the airline still expects a yield decline of 10-20 pct as competitors dump prices.
 We continue to be cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year," said chief executive Michael O'Leary. But 
he noted the airline still expects to achieve passenger volume growth this year of 20 pct (to around 27.5 mln 
passengers) and deliver increased load factors.
    Deputy chief executive Michael Cawley repeated Ryanair's forecast that the winter months will see a bloodbath in 
the low-cost sector.
    "We don't see that there's any reason not to anticipate it," he told AFX News.
    "They tell us there are over 50 low-fare carriers in Europe… From our point of view we see many of those will 
inevitably fall. We're already seeing carriers withdrawing from particular routes, that's symptomatic of this kind of 
situation."
ROUNDUP Ryanair cautious on outlook as Q1 profits rise 21 pct
    But Cawley still anticipates a year to end-March 2005 net profit "north of 200 mln eur" as long as the winter yield 
decline falls within the airline's expected range.
    Ryanair's unit costs fell by 4 pct during the first quarter as it continues to benefit from the ongoing introduction of 
the larger 737-800s as they replace the remaining 13 737-200s.
    The airline is almost fully hedged on oil until the end of the second quarter but largely unhedged thereafter.
    "We believe that over the medium term prices will fall and therefore it would be unwise to lock-in at the current 
high rates," said O'Leary. "We anticipate that we will be able to largely offset these higher oil prices in this fiscal 
year by making cost savings in other areas."
    The group said its two new bases at Rome Ciampino and Barcelona Girona performed well in the quarter.
    On July 21 airport operator BAA PLC announced it was suing Ryanair over 1 mln stg of "unpaid" aeronautical 
charges at Stansted. The Irish airline responded by saying it will contest the case and issued its own proceedings 
against BAA alleging monopoly abuse of fuel levies.
    At 12.15 pm shares in Ryanair were down 7 cents at 4.33 eur.

(Updating to add more detail from Ryanair statement)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, has
reported a 21 pct increase in first quarter profit after tax, a touch above market expectations but has reiterated its 
cautious yield guidance for the balance of the year.
    For the three months to June 30 the Dublin-based airline, which operates 161 routes across 17 countries with a 
fleet of 72 aircraft, made a profit after tax of 53.1 mln eur up from 43.8 mln eur last time, with a 6 pct decline in 
yields (average fares) offset by passenger growth of 28 pct to 6.6 mln.
    The outcome also benefited from a weak comparative as in the first quarter last year Ryanair acquired Buzz, the 
low-cost unit of KLM. During April 2003 Buzz was closed while management restructured its routes and operations, 
re-opening in May.
    Adjusted profit after tax of 52.6 mln eur versus 40.5 mln eur last time excludes the non-recurring costs of the re-
organisation of Buzz in April 2003 of 2.7 mln eur and goodwill charges of 0.6 mln eur in both the quarters ended 
June 30 2003 and 2004.
    First quarter revenue increased 23 pct to 302.8 mln eur, while basic earnings per share rose to 7.0 cents from 
5.8.
    The 6 pct yield decline reflected intense competition throughout Europe in the no-frills sector but was towards the 
lower end of Ryanair's guidance of a fall of 5-10 pct, which it has maintained for the second quarter.
 For the winter the airline still expects a yield decline of 10-20 pct as competitors dump prices.
    We continue to be cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
    "We expect to achieve passenger volume growth this fiscal year in the order of 20 pct (to 27.5 mln passengers) 
and deliver increased load factors."
    Ryanair's unit costs fell by 4 pct during the quarter as it continues to benefit from the ongoing introduction of the 
larger 737-800's as they replace the remaining 13 737-200's.
    The airline is almost fully hedged on oil until the end of the second quarter but largely unhedged thereafter.

    "We believe that over the medium term prices will fall and therefore it would be unwise to lock-in at the current 
high rates," said O'Leary.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, has reported an increase in first quarter underlying net 
profit a touch above market expectations but has reiterated its cautious forward yield guidance.
    For the three months to June 30 the Dublin-based airline made net income before exceptional costs and goodwill 
charges of 52.6 mln eur compared to analyst forecasts of 49-52 mln eur and up from 40.5 mln eur last time, with a 6 
decline in yields (average fares) offset by passenger growth of 28 pct to 6.6 mln passengers.
 The outcome also benefited from a weak comparative as in the first quarter last year Ryanair acquired Buzz, the 
low-cost unit of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. During April 2003 Buzz was closed while management restructured its 
routes and operations, re-opening in May.
    First quarter revenue increased to 302.7 mln eur from 245.2 mln, while earnings per share before exceptional 
costs and goodwill charges rose to 7.0 cents from 5.8.

lower end of Ryanair's guidance of a fall of 5-10 pct, which it has maintained for the second quarter.
    For the winter the airline still expects a yield decline of 10-20 pct as competitors cut prices to try to stay in 
business.
    Ryanair shares closed Monday at 4.4 eur.

Leading shares are expected to move modestly higher in early trade this morning after yesterday's slight slip back 
following a positive performance overnight on Wall Street, defiant in the face of fresh terror attack threats, with 
results from RBoS key, dealers said.
    Spread bettors IG Index expect the FTSE 100 index to open about 8 points firmer.
    The UK blue chip index ended 2.6 points lower yesterday at 4,415.7.
    Overnight on Wall Street, the DJIA ended 39.45 points firmer at 10,179.16 helped by post-results strength in 
Procter & Gamble, as traders defied the terror threats made against financial institutions in New York and 
Washington.
    Meanwhile the Nasdaq composite index closed 4.73 points higher at 1,892.09.
    Asian markets, however, were mixed today, with the Nikkei 225 ending its morning session 73.98 points lower at 
11,148.26, but the Hang Seng Index at midday was 122.57 points higher at 12,323.96 boosted by strong results 
yesterday from HSBC/Hang Seng Bank.
    Once again banking issues should be to the fore on the corporate news front in London following yesterday's 
good HSBC numbers, confirmation of Abbey National counter-bid possibilities from HBOS, and with the interim 
reporting season continuing today with numbers from RBoS -- the UK partner of Abbey agreed bidder SCH.
    Analysts expect the Scottish bank to post pretax profit before goodwill amortisations and provisions of 3.78- 3.85 
bln stg, up from 3.45 bln stg last time out.
    Key features of RBoS's interims are expected to include strong income growth, a further improvement in 
efficiency, and stable credit metrics, according to analysts.
 In its pre-close trading update at the beginning of June, RBoS said first-half profits were anticipated to be in line 
with expectations.
    Among other blue chip results due today, Scottish & Newcastle will be in focus as it unveils its first interims as a 
fully-focused international brewer following last year's sale of its former 1,400-strong pubs chain to Spirit.
    The disposal will mean that comparatives will be difficult, while the absence of pub-related profits this time will 
mean a sharp drop in headline profits and some dilution to earnings per share.
London shares outlook - Firm after defiant gains in New York ; RBoS numbers key
    Analyst expectations are for first-half pretax profits before exceptionals of around 155-168 mln stg, against a pro-
forma figure of 217 mln stg last year.
    And industrial gases giant BOC is expected to report steady growth in third quarter profit, buoyed by continued 
recovery at its Edwards unit and the core gases business.
    Forecasts for third-quarter pretax profit before exceptional items range from 122 mln stg to 136 mln stg, up from 
the previous year's 115.2 mln outcome.
    Meanwhile on the second line, no-frills Irish airline Ryanair saw its first-quarter underlying net income arrive at 
the top end of expectations at 52.6 mln eur, up from 44 mln last time out.
    Analysts' expected the figures to come within a 48.5-52 mln eur range.
    However, the good headline figures could be offset by news that Ryanair's yields fell 6 pct in the first quarter, and 
the airline expects a 5-10 pct yield decline in the second quarter.
    Elsewhere with the mid caps, housebuilder Taylor Woodrow should post a good increase in its first-half results 
reflecting the strength of the US housing market and a much improved market in the UK relative to H1 2003.
    Morgan Stanley expects Taylor Woodrow to report first-half pretax profit before goodwill and exceptional items -- 
though including a one-off gain of 12.0 mln for the St. Katherine's Dock disposal -- of 184.5 mln, an increase of 35 
pct on the 136.8 mln stg outcome seen at the same stage last year.
    Catering equipment firm Enodis, however, is expected to see its third-quarter results show a slight dip today, with 
Investec forecasting 'clean' pretax profit of 10.0 mln stg, down from 11.3 mln at the same stage last year
    Among the other small cap results due today, Quantica is expected to report a successful first half, with Baird 
Equities predicting an improvement in pretax profit to 850,000 stg, up from 590,000 stg last year.
    Meanwhile, Computer Software Group are expected to post a return to full year profits.
    The firm said back in March that it expects the year to February 2004 results to show pretax profit before 
amortisation and finance costs of about 600,000 stg, against losses of 150,000 stg last year.
    Both DataCash, and XP Power will also release interim numbers today.
    UK economic news is unlikely to excite today as investors focus ahead to expectations for a fresh hike in interest 
rates at this week's Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee meeting.
    The UK July CIPS PMI construction report is due at 9.30 am, followed by that latest CBI monthly distributive 
trades survey at 11.00 am.
    Similarly the day's US economic pointers, June personal income and consumer spending figures, are likely to be 
passed as investors look more keenly ahead to Friday's influential July jobs report.

Europe's major bourses remained higher midday as Wall Street is seen adding to its recent winning streak at the 
open, dealers said.
    At 11.48 am, the STOXX 50 was up 1.88 points at 2650.96 and the STOXX 600 was up 0.23 points at 236.37, 
but off intra-morning highs as investors are waiting to see whether the DJIA will be able to sustain opening gains.
    Spreadbetting firm IG Index is expecting the DJIA to add 4 points after five consecutive days of gains.
    Scottish and Newcastle moved 1.74 pct higher in opening deals after the UK brewing group published solid 
interim results and gave an upbeat outlook for the full year. 
    German healthcare group Altana rose 1.28 pct after its quarterly figures were better than expected and thanks to 
short covering after recent underperformance.
    And Switzerland's Saia-Burgess climbed 4.69 pct after the company published better-than-expected first half 
results.
    BNP Paribas led the STOXX 50 risers -- up 1.79 pct -- after Deutsche Bank upgraded its rating to 'buy' from 'hold' 
a day after the bank's higher-than-expected second quarter earnings.
    And Deutsche Telekom rose 1.17 pct after UBS upgraded its stance on the group to 'buy' from 'neutral'.
    On the downside, UK banking group RBoS fell 2.95 pct after its in-line numbers, as the group's chief executive 
said it expects margins to be flat in the second half and may even fall.
    And on-line banking group Egg fell 25 pct after Prudential said it is no longer in talks regarding the possible sale 
of its 79 pct stake in the group.
 The group had been struggling to find a buyer for the stake.
    Prudential fell 3.1 pct on the news, which prompted Cazenove to cut its rating to cut to 'in-line' vs 'outperform'.
    France's Havas fell 0.98 pct after its second quarter numbers as group revenues missed expectations.
    BOC fell 3.37 pct as the group's solid third quarter results were overshadowed by a slowdown in orders at its 
BOC Edwards unit.
    Ryanair fell 2.49 pct after strong quarterly numbers as the group's cautious outlook statement unsettled 
investors.
Euroshares still higher midday as Wall St set for further gains
    Norske Skog's gloomy outlook statement also weighed. The group's shares fell 2.41 pct after the group said it 
expects a weak second half, but an improvement in 2005.
    And shares in Atos Origin were 3.47 pct lower in late morning trade, after the company delayed the publication of 
its second quarter sales to Sept 8 from Aug 13, dealers said.
    "The market generally reacts negatively to such announcements," one Paris dealer said.
    On the economic front, US June personal income data and US July auto sales numbers are also expected to 
attract some attention.

The FTSE 100 remained under pressure in midafternoon trade, as fears over US terrorist attacks and a weak start 
by Wall Street outweighed a firm banking sector after strong figures from HSBC, dealers said.
    By 15.00, the FTSE 100 index was down 9.1 points at 4,404.0, while the broader indices were also weaker.
    Volume was on the low side, with 1.5 bln shares changing hands in 130,700 deals.
    On Wall Street, the DJIA lost 18.00 points to 10,121.70 in early deals, while the Nasdaq fell 9.83 points to 
1,877.53, with sentiment dented by US intelligence reports that al-Qaeda may be targeting several US financial 
institutions across the country.
    The news sent crude prices to nearly 44 usd a barrel in overnight trading.
    In US economic news, the ISM manufacturing index rose to 62 in July, slightly ahead of the market's expectation 
of 61.5 and above the 61.1 recorded in June.
    In London, financials remained in focus as better than expected interim figures from HSBC pushed the banking 
sector higher, bucking the general market trend.
    Shares in the world's second largest bank rose 28 pence at 335-1/2, after it posted a 53 pct jump in interim 
pretax profits to 9.368 bln usd -- comfortably ahead of the market's forecasts which ranged from 8.2-to-9.2 bln usd.
    The news provided a fillip to the rest of the sector, with fellow Asian based bank Standard Chartered up 8-1/2 at 
572, Royal Bank of Scotland up 4 at 1,550 and Barclays 3-1/2 higher at 463-1/2.
 Banking stocks also received a boost from weekend press speculation over the future of Abbey National, with 
newspapers suggesting that a rival bidder could make a "white knight" approach for the group.
    An announcement from peer HBOS that it is reviewing whether a combination with Abbey could be in the best 
interests of its shareholders helped spur Abbey's share price up 16 at 583.
    Meanwhile HBOS fell 18 to 694-1/2 on the news.
    Also among the fallers, shares in British Airways lost 9 pence to 221-3/4, impacted by US terror attack fears and 
the spiralling cost of fuel prices.
    The gloom also spread to the low cost carriers, with second liners Easyjet down 2-1/2 pence to 145-1/2 and 
Ryanair off 0.10 eur to 4.40 ahead of its figures tomorrow.
London shares remain lower in midafternoon trade as US terror fears weigh
    Terrorism fears also hit BAA, with the shares falling 4-1/2 pence to 555, despite better than expected first-quarter 
numbers from the airports operator.
    BAA posted a 25.2 pct rise in first quarter pretax profit at 159 mln stg, towards the top end of market hopes, and 
left its full year expectations unchanged.
    Merrill Lynch, Panmure Gordon and HSBC all reiterated their 'buy' recommendations.
    BOC shares were also lower ahead of its quarterly numbers tomorrow.
    The gases group also revealed today that the number of US welding fume cases have risen to 433 by 
approximately 9,524 plaintiffs.
    BOC shares fell 10-1/2 pence to 932-1/2.
    On the second line, International Power shares ran into profit-taking after Friday's good gains which followed the 
release of positive interim results, a successful restructuring of its US debt, the purchase of a 70 pct stake in Edison 
Mission Energy, and a 291 mln stg rights issues.
    In reaction to last week's news, JP Morgan hiked its rating for International Power today to 'neutral' from 
'underweight'.
    International Power was down 3 at 143-3/4.
    On the upside, shares in motor dealer Inchcape drove 47 pence higher to 1,672 after the firm posted a bigger-
than-expected rise in interim profit and said it was "confident" of a strong full-year performance.
    Elsewhere, broker comment was a spur to gains in Bodycote shares, up 4-3/4 pence to 152-3/4, with Lehman 
hiking its rating to 'overweight' from 'equal-weight' and raising its target price to 175 pence from 145.
    WH Smith pushed 3-3/4 pence higher to 294-3/4 after the high street retailer announced the sale of its publishing 
business Hodder Headline to France's Hachette Livre for 223 mln stg, and plans to return 207 mln stg of the 
disposal proceeds to shareholders.
    Shares in Warner Chilcot -- formerly known as Galen -- were also in demand, up 27 pence at 627 following news 
late on Friday that a US court has ruled in its favour on the Sarafem patent litigation dispute with Teva 
Pharmaceuticals.

     After trading in negative territory for most of the day, the FTSE 100 managed to close higher, with strong gains 
by the banking sector helping to counter a weak morning by Wall Street as terror fears unsettled US investors, 
dealers said.
    By the close, the FTSE 100 index was up 2.6 points at 4,415.7, while the broader indices remained weaker.

the country. The news sent crude prices to nearly 44 usd a barrel in overnight trading. In London, a firm financial 
sector gave the market some much needed direction with better than expected interim figures from HSBC helping 
the FTSE 100 avoid its first negative close for five sessions.
    HSBC led the way, with a gain of 26 points to 833-1/2, after the world's second largest bank posted a 53 pct jump 
in interim pretax profits to 9.368 bln usd -- comfortably ahead of expectations.
    The news provided a fillip to the rest of the sector, with fellow Asian based bank Standard Chartered up 11-1/2 at

London shares remained lower in midday trade as fresh terrorist fears hit sentiment, offsetting robust figures from 
HSBC, with Wall Street seen opening down, putting an end to four days of gains last week, dealers said.
    At 11.58 am, the FTSE 100 was off 8.5 points at 4,404.6, in line with the wider indices. Volume was uninspiring at 
775.2 mln.
    Wall Street was seen opening as much as 36 points lower, hit by a combination of reports that Al-Qaeda is 
planning fresh attacks on New York and Washington, and concern over the spiralling price of oil.
    In London, all eyes were on the financial sector as HSBC posted a 53 pct hike in interim profits, beating analysts' 
expectations.
    Shares in the world's second largest bank, topped the FTSE 100 leader board, up 28 at 335-1/2, after it posted a 
pretax profit of 9.368 bln usd -- well ahead of the market's forecasts which ranged from 8.2-to-9.2 bln usd.
    The main drivers of growth were Personal Financial Services earnings -- with revenues 14 pct higher than last 
year -- Goldman Sachs said.
    In addition, the broker said, the group saw efficiency gains across all its business units and a strong performance 
in fees, commissions and foreign exchange.
    HSBC, which had previously confirmed it is in talks to buy 19.9 pct of Bank of Communications in China, today 
also confirmed it has reached an agreement in principle on the terms of the investment.
 HSBC's fortune rubbed off on its peers, with Standard Chartered up 15-1/2 at 579, Royal Bank of Scotland up 15 at 
1,561 and Barclays 3-1/2 higher at 463-1/2
    Meanwhile, a combination of news and rumour on the future of Abbey National also helped to drive the financial 
sector higher.
    The mortgage bank, which last week agreed a take-over from Spain's SCH, was boosted by speculation that rival 
bidders could make a "white knight" approach for the group.
    An announcement from peer HBOS that it is reviewing whether a combination with Abbey could be in the best 
interests of its shareholders, helped spur Abbey's share price up 11-3/4 at 578-3/4.

    Meanwhile HBOS fell 16-1/2 to 696 on the news.
    Sector consolidation hopes helped boost Alliance & Leicester 1/2 higher at 847-1/2 and Bradford & Bingley was 
up 1-2/2 to 270-1/2.
    Outside of financials, shares in British Airways topped the fallers, down 7-3/4 pence at 223, impacted by the fresh 
US terror attack threat and the spiralling cost of oil.
    Like-wise second line low cost carriers Easyjet, and Ryanair were off - down 3 at 145 pence and 0.10 at 4.40 eur 
respectively. The Irish no-frills airline posts results tomorrow.
    The spectre of terrorism also hit BAA, down 4-1/2 pence to 555. The UK airport operator was also hit by fears 
over the funding of Stansted's expansion plans.
    The drop comes despite the airport operator reporting a 25.2 pct rise in first quarter pretax profit at 159 mln stg, 
towards the top end of market hopes, and stating its expectations for the full year have not changed.
    On the upside, clothing retailer Next gained - up 2 at 1,499 - after news the firm's executive directors have been 
locked in a 4 year share investment deal.
    Panmure Gordon repeated its 'buy' stance on Next in the wake of the news.
    Second line street retailer peer WH Smith pushed 2-3/4 pence higher to 293-3/4 after the high street retailer 
announced the sale of its publishing business Hodder Headline to France's Hachette Livre for 223 mln stg, and 
plans to return 207 mln stg of the disposal proceeds to shareholders.
    The news prompted Seymour Pierce to reiterate its 'hold' rating, with the broker arguing that although the move 
was well flagged, the timing was earlier then it had anticipated.
    Meanwhile, intraday on Friday, HSBC upped its stance on WH Smith to 'reduce' from 'sell'.
    In more FTSE 250 news, shares in Warner Chilcot -- formerly known as Galen -- rose 30 pence at 630 following 
news late on Friday that a US court has ruled in its favour on the Sarafem patent litigation dispute with Teva 
Pharmaceuticals.
    Elsewhere, shares in motor dealer Inchcape drove 47 pence higher to 1,672 after the firm posted a bigger-than-
expected rise in interim profit and said it was "confident" of a strong full-year performance.
    Inchcape reported first half pretax profit, before exceptional items and goodwill up 34 pct to 88.9 mln stg.
    Broker comment was a spur to gains in Bodycote shares, up 4-1/4 pence to 152-1/4, with Lehman hiking its 
rating to 'overweight' from 'equal-weight' and raising its target price to 175 pence from 145.
    And Manchester United shares kicked 1 pence higher at 254-1/2 after the Sunday Times suggested that the 
family of US sports tycoon Malcolm Glazer -- the owner of around a 19 pct stake in the football group -- is in talks 
with bankers about raising cash for a full takeover bid.
    But on the downside, International Power shares ran into profit-taking after Friday's good gains which followed 
the release of positive interim results, a successful restructuring of its US debt, the purchase of a 70 pct stake in 
Edison Mission Energy, and a 291 mln stg rights issues.
    In reaction to last week's news, JP Morgan hiked its rating for International Power today to 'neutral' from 
'underweight'.
    International Power was down 3 at 143-3/4..

    SATURDAY PRESS COMMENT
    FT
 THE LEX COLUMN comments on JARVIS (the notoriously opaque Jarvis is
belatedly trying to become more transparent; government officials handling PFI should now do the same), 
INTERNATIONAL POWER's acquisition of Edison Mission Energy (IP is keeping 100 pct equity ownership, so it is 
in a position to benefit if the US market recovers from 2007), UFJ Holdings, LLOYDS TSB (the substantial dividend 
remains the principal reason for buying the shares, which trade at a slight price/earnings premium to its peers - 
barring the Asian banks and, of course, ABBEY) - (Arun) Sarin's strategy leaves VODAFONE investors an after-
taste of doubt (MONEY & BUSINESS p.3) - Weekend share watch: RECKITT BENCKISER (fully valued - Morgan 
Stanley), PZ CUSSONS (some analysts expect
Cussons' shares to add lustre in the future thanks to the "corporate  conditioner" of buy-backs, which the group 
could fund with its strong cash pile), HAVELOCK EUROPA (trading at about 11 times 2004 estimates; this looks 
cheap for a company with a sound balance sheet, comfortable interest cover, and what appear to be excellent 
growth prospects) - JARVIS still has a long and rocky road to ride; in spite of a recovery plan being set in motion, 
AFX UK at a glance share guide
the support services group is beset by fundamental uncertainties (MONEY & BUSINESS p.4) - EXEL (with the 
shares now trading at 16 times earnings, ahead of the sector average of 13, this is a high premium to pay)
    Mail
 MICROCAP EQUITIES (dealers hear it has sold its interest in Active Hotels for around 300,000 stg; the sale 
bolsters its war chest and brings the strongly-rumoured acquisition closer) - NATIONAL EXPRESS (chairman forks 
out more than 1 mln stg to double his shareholding)

 BARCLAYS (rumours that next week's interim figures could disappoint) - COOKSON (institutional support) - 
HOUSE OF FRASER (suggestions it might make a bid for rival Allders) - EASYSCREEN (talk that the 2.5 mln stg

expressed an interest in acquiring it; according to gossip, they are prepared to offer around 600 pence) - MEDICAL 
SOLUTIONS (market professionals believe up to five local health authorities are poised to follow the lead of Wales 
and choose the company's Surepath LBC cervical screening system) HOMESTYLE (Formal Property Management 
Services, a
mysterious Jersey-based group, emerges with a 5 pct holding)
    Times
 MALLETT (Jack Petchey's Trefick raises stake to 28.05 pct) - Tempus: Surprises could flow from water regulator's

its newly-acquired Scotty business is set  to announce a deal to supply video-conferencing systems to a European 
finance house; also talk of a US contract win for its Carestation product) - WHO'S DEALING:  MCKAY

 The Business
 VALUE INVESTOR: SOMERFIELD (M&S has a huge brand, Somerfield has a small one and where M&S has 
completely to revolutionise itself to make much progress, Somerfield has to increase its operating margin by 1 pct 
and a smidgen to double its profits; if Somerfield rose 50 pct it would still be over a 50 pct discount to Tesco and a 
massive fourfold to M&S) - SMALL-CAP INVESTOR: NEXT FIFTEEN COMMUNICATIONS (the shares give 
investors exposure to the recovering advertising and marketing spending) - AIM INVESTOR: CELTIC

    SATURDAY PRESS COMMENT
    FT
 THE LEX COLUMN comments on JARVIS (the notoriously opaque Jarvis is
belatedly trying to become more transparent; government officials
handling PFI should now do the same), INTERNATIONAL POWER's acquisition
of Edison Mission Energy (IP is keeping 100 pct equity ownership, so it
AFX UK at a glance share guide
is in a position to benefit if the US market recovers from 2007), UFJ
Holdings, LLOYDS TSB (the substantial dividend remains the principal
reason for buying the shares, which trade at a slight price/earnings

(Arun) Sarin's strategy leaves VODAFONE investors an after-taste of
doubt (MONEY & BUSINESS p.3) - Weekend share watch: RECKITT BENCKISER
(fully valued - Morgan Stanley), PZ CUSSONS (some analysts expect
Cussons' shares to add lustre in the future thanks to the "corporate
conditioner" of buy-backs, which the group could fund with its strong
cash pile), HAVELOCK EUROPA (trading at about 11 times 2004 estimates;
this looks cheap for a company with a sound balance sheet, comfortable
interest cover, and what appear to be excellent growth prospects) -
JARVIS still has a long and rocky road to ride; in spite of a recovery
plan being set in motion, the support services group is beset by
fundamental uncertainties (MONEY & BUSINESS p.4) - EXEL (with the shares
now trading at 16 times earnings, ahead of the sector average of 13,
this is a high premium to pay)

 MICROCAP EQUITIES (dealers hear it has sold its interest in Active
Hotels for around 300,000 stg; the sale bolsters its war chest and
brings the strongly-rumoured acquisition closer) - NATIONAL EXPRESS

have expressed an interest in acquiring it; according to gossip, they
are prepared to offer around 600 pence) - MEDICAL SOLUTIONS (market
professionals believe up to five local health authorities are poised to
follow the lead of Wales and choose the company's Surepath LBC cervical
screening system) HOMESTYLE (Formal Property Management Services, a
mysterious Jersey-based group, emerges with a 5 pct holding)
    Times
 MALLETT (Jack Petchey's Trefick raises stake to 28.05 pct) - Tempus:
Surprises could flow from water regulator's review (given their recent
strength, water shares do not look particularly cheap and new investors
should certainly wait until the dust has settled after the review)

    SUNDAY PRESS COMMENT
 The Business
 VALUE INVESTOR: SOMERFIELD (M&S has a huge brand, Somerfield has a
small one and where M&S has completely to revolutionise itself to make
much progress, Somerfield has to increase its operating margin by 1 pct
and a smidgen to double its profits; if Somerfield rose 50 pct it would
still be over a 50 pct discount to Tesco and a massive fourfold to M&S)

investors exposure to the recovering advertising and marketing spending)
