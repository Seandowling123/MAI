Yuckspeak
Wonderful piece of jargon on Twitter from Lt Gen Ivan Jones, the British Army’s commander field army, explaining 
the thinking behind the service’s latest restructuring.
“Rebalancing will create an Army of integrated, inter-dependent and complimentary [sic] formations that offer 
strategic choice and better enable us to compete with adversaries above and below threshold of conflict.”
As one Twitter user pointed out, it is a bit like Churchill rousing the nation with: “Hostilities will be engaged with our 
adversary on the coastal perimeter”.

Boeing needs to ‘get its [act] together’: Ryanair chief
That was how we delicately headlined a recent online story, avoiding the rather more colourful term used by 
Michael O’Leary when urging a prompt resolution of the 737 Max crisis. Unfortunately, there was little option but to 
use the actual four-letter word in the actual text.
Sir Michael Marshall
We are sorry to hear of the sudden death – at the age of 87 – of Sir Michael Marshall, chairman of the Cambridge 
family firm famous for both military aircraft engineering and its car dealerships.
Sir Michael, who died on holiday in Spain, succeeded his father Sir Arthur Marshall (1903-2007) at the head of the 
company. Sir Arthur, in turn, was the son of David Marshall, who founded the garage and car hire business in 1907.

Under Sir Michael, the Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group has enjoyed considerable success in the specialist 
area of military maintenance, repair and overhaul, and earlier this year announced that it had outgrown its premises 
at Cambridge airport and planned to leave the city for a new site by 2030.
Sir Michael Marshall read history at Jesus College, Cambridge after completing national service as a Royal Air 
Force pilot from 1950 to 1952. He joined the family business and was appointed deputy chairman of the Marshall 
Group in 1965, and group chairman and chief executive in 1989. In 2011, he handed over chief executive 
responsibilities to his son Robert, but remained chairman.
Among many other positions, he was president of the Air League from 2004 to 2009. He was also an international 
rower, representing England in the European Championships in 1955.

British Airways chief Alex Cruz insists that introduction of the Boeing 737 Max would not contradict parent company 
IAG’s efforts to simplify its short-haul fleet.
IAG has been engaged in an effort to achieve greater commonality of configuration between the Airbus A320-family 
jets across its group carriers.
This process is designed to achieve weight savings and allow greater flexibility to transfer aircraft between the IAG 
operators.
BA withdrew its last 737s in 2015, in favour of Airbus single-aisle jets, and IAG’s Vueling, Iberia and Aer Lingus all 
use A320-family aircraft.
But the tentative IAG agreement signed at the Paris air show in June for up to 200 737 Max jets would not 
necessarily upset this harmonisation, insists Cruz.
Speaking to FlightGlobal ahead of BA’s inaugural A350-1000 service to Madrid, Cruz said the company had the 
production volume to support more than one provider.
“If you have 20 or 30 aircraft a single type is important,” he says. “When you have 400 you have more flexibility.”
He points out that Ryanair, an exclusive 737-800 operator, has reached the point where it can accommodate the 
Airbus operation of Austrian division Lauda.
Without specifically suggesting that Airbus delivery delays might have influenced the IAG decision, Cruz states that 
substantial adjustments to planning have to be made if individual aircraft do not arrive on time. “We have sufficient 
reason not to be happy,” he adds.
Max introduction will not affect IAG fleet simplification drive, says BA 's Cruz Carrier could add up to 200 
examples of Boeing jet, and is working to advance d....
BA has indicated that 737 Max operations would be conducted from London Gatwick, where the airline formerly 
used 737-400s.
Meanwhile, IAG is in talks with Boeing on advancing the start of 737 Max deliveries to 2022, a year earlier than 
previously disclosed.
Revealing the agreeement, Boeing and IAG gave a delivery timeframe of 2023-2027. During a 2 August results 
briefing, IAG chief executive Willie Walsh described the latest delivery discussions with Boeing as “very 
constructive”.
Walsh contrasts the possibility of introducing the Max earlier than planned with the delivery delays affecting Airbus 
A321s.
He says IAG is “very disappointed” with Airbus’s delivery performance and brands the output of the airframer’s 
Hamburg site – where A321s are assembled – as “very poor”.
The facility is struggling with its A321neo delivery plan partly as a result of building the A320 family’s largest variant 
with different airframe configurations – an obstacle to making the assembly process more efficient and ramping up 
production.
Walsh says the delays are “completely unacceptable” as they have affected IAG’s network plan and, in particular, 
that of Irish subsidiary Aer Lingus.
In March, Aer Lingus said that it would launch its Dublin-Montreal route in summer 2020, rather than August 2019 
as previously planned.

The latest arrival at British Airways marks the next step in the transformation of the carrier’s fleet.
Under that modernisation process, old Boeing 767s have been phased out for 787s, and the superannuated 737-
400 fleet has been retired in favour of the Airbus A320neo.
This time BA’s new kid on the block is the A350-1000, the largest variant of the Airbus big twin.
These will begin the arguably long overdue process of supplanting the flag carrier’s elderly 747-400s.
While there can be few rivals to the Queen of the Skies’ crown, the economics are painfully obvious: BA expects the 
A350 to burn fuel at roughly half the rate of the 747, despite accommodating only six fewer passengers than the 
337-seat jumbo.
In addition, the Airbus platform allows BA to introduce its new business-class cabin, a product that will be rolled out 
across the fleet over the coming years.
Indeed, that same cabin will also feature on the 777Xs that are due to begin arriving in the early part of next 
decade. As it happens, these widebody twins will also replace 747s, as well as a handful of 777-200s.
This strategy makes sense within the wider context of parent company IAG, which is attempting to reduce fleet 
complexity across the group’s airlines.
That has particular relevance in the short-haul operation, where the group has been seeking greater commonality of 
configuration, partly to save weight and partly to enable better operational flexibility.
BA withdrew its last 737s in 2015 in favour of Airbus single-aisle jets, and sister operators Aer Lingus, Iberia and 
Vueling all fly A320-family aircraft.
Keep it simple; Fleet renewal and simplification have been driving the acquisition of new jets for BA and parent 
IAG, but can the 737 Max fit within those stric....
Jets – or even crews, presumably – can now be switched between carriers should the need arise.
But the fly in the ointment is the 737 Max. At June’s Paris air show, IAG tentatively committed to take up to 200 of 
the re-engined Boeing narrowbodies for BA, throwing that quest for commonality into question.
BA chief Alex Cruz argues that the arrival of the Max is not counter to the streamlining effort, claiming that with a big 
enough fleet a single type is less important.
Perhaps this is true. However, it is telling that the likes of EasyJet and Ryanair have profited in part from a rigid 
adherence to a single-type fleet and, save for the latter’s Lauda offshoot, show no sign of abandoning this strategy.
What the addition of the re-engined 737 will bring, however, is better fleet resilience should one type be pulled from 
service for safety reasons.
It is perhaps ironic, though, that the still-grounded Max should provide that safety net.

Ryanair has instigated legal proceedings against departing chief operating officer Peter Bellew, according to court 
documents.
The Court Service of Ireland's website shows that "Ryanair DAC v Bellew" was filed with Ireland's High Court on 6 
August. No further details are provided, but Peter Bellew is listed as the defendant.
Bellew confirmed in mid-July that he would be leaving Ryanair at the end of this year. A week later, low-cost rival 
EasyJet disclosed during its third-quarter results presentation that he would be taking its vacant chief operating 
officer role.
Speaking during an earnings call on 29 July, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary acknowledged that he could 
not comment on "any individual's contract or termination".
But he stated: "All of the senior management in Ryanair have pretty long termination or notice periods in their 
contracts... And thereafter, they have a pretty extensive non-compete agreement, which arises from the share 
option schemes that they have agreed and received over a period of time.
"So I would not expect any senior manager in Ryanair to be moving to a competitive airline for a reasonably long 
period of time. And that applies to me, it applies to all of the senior management team."
EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said on 18 July that Bellew's starting date with the carrier was yet to be 
confirmed. The Luton-based operator had been searching for a new chief operating officer since Chris Browne 
announced her retirement in March.

Highlight: British Airways has angered passengers again with cancelled flights and risks lowering its approval 
rating further.
Body
At least 117 flights were cancelled across Heathrow, Gatwick and London City airports on 7 August because of an 
IT failure. The company could face Â£8 million in compensation payouts and more flights may be affected as it 
attempts to resume normal service. Big plans for improving reputation need to be implemented or the airline risks 
losing potential passengers. 
A middling reputation has been part of the downfall for many airline failures in recent years including Monarch and 
Air Berlin. British Airways: reputation in tattersThe underlying problem that has occurred time and again is a lack of 
communication. Multiple reports of a lack of meaningful information about the delays and cancellations for stranded 
passengers suggest the situation was not handled as well as it could have been. Just two days before this latest 
incident, passengers on British Airways flight BA422 travelling from London to Valencia had to exit the plane by 
emergency escape chutes and wait three hours to be reunited with their luggage after the cabin filled with smoke. 
Obviously technical issues are out of the control of the specific airline staff, but more communication may have 
lessened passengers' worries. British Airways has had the benefit of trading on its very good reputation it was even 
voted the world's best in 2006 but its decline in customer service has not gone unnoticed. British Airways is rated 
one-out-of-five stars on Trust Pilot's website, and five-out-of-10 on Skytrax. Its decision to remove free food from its 
short-haul flights in January 2017 was seen as taking a step closer to operating as a low-cost carrier. Passenger 
reviews reflect that. According to Airfleets, British Airways has one of the oldest fleets of the major players and 
some cabins are described as scuffed and dirty. With economy passengers receiving only a slightly better service 
than on easyJet or Ryanair, BA's long-standing reputation will soon not be enough to deter passengers from opting 
for the no-frills champions instead. This all comes as BA celebrates 100 years since it started flying, with a star-
studded advert designed as 'a love letter to Britain' accompanied by a retro paint-job for four of its planes. 
Passengers affected by its latest faults may instead be reminded of a past where the company resonated better 
British Airways needs a change of approach to bring passengers back onside
with its passengers. With Asian airlines presently ruling the World Airline Awards there will need to be a big shift to 
change perceptions back to when BA ruled.

Ryanair has launched legal proceedings against its outgoing Chief Operations Officer (COO) Peter Bellew, whom 
low cost rival easyJet announced last month it had poached, Irish court filings showed.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary told staff on July 11 that Bellew would step down at the end of the year. easyJet 
announced his arrival as its new COO at an unspecified date a week later.
The legal proceedings were lodged in the Irish High Court on Aug. 6. No further details of the case were made 
available.
Asked about Bellew's departure on an analyst call last week, O'Leary said he could not comment on it for legal 
reasons but said all senior management at the Irish airline had pretty extensive non-compete agreements in their 
contracts.
"I would not expect any senior manager in Ryanair to be moving to a competitive airline for a reasonably long 
period of time," he said, adding the airline was in dialogue with Bellew regarding his six-month termination period.
Ryanair and easyJet said they would not comment on the matter. Bellew, who rejoined Ryanair in December 2017 
after a stint as chief executive at Malaysia Airlines, could not immediately be reached for comment. (Reuters)

Ryanair Irish pilots back industrial action as unrest spreads
Ryanair Irish pilots back industrial action as unrest spreads

Ryanair's directly employed pilots in Ireland on Friday voted in favor of industrial action unless pay demands are 
met swiftly, with Spanish pilots also threatening to join growing unrest at the airline.
Europe's largest budget airline suffered a number of strikes last year by pilots and cabin crew, forcing it to cancel 
hundreds of flights and hitting profit after a rocky start to its move to recognize trade unions for the first time.
Ryanair managed to quell the disputes by reaching deals with many unions in Europe on pay and allowances, but it 
has yet to move beyond recognition agreements with others and further angered unions by telling staff 10 days ago 
that it had 900 more pilots and crew than it needed.
Members of Ryanair's British pilots union voted this week to follow Portuguese cabin crew to the picket line, with 
two strikes planned from Aug. 22. The action in Ireland was backed by 94% of those who cast a ballot among the 
180 eligible pilots.
About a quarter of Ryanair's 350 pilots in its home market staged a series of one-day strikes a year ago before 
concerns on transfers and promotions were settled, but the Forsa/IALPA trade union said the airline has stalled on 
talks since pay demands were submitted in late March.
"They (pilots) feel they have been forced into contemplating potentially disruptive industrial action by a company 
that seems either unwilling or unable to negotiate in a professional and constructive manner," Forsa's assistant 
general secretary, Ian McDonnell, said in a statement.
"At this stage, only a substantive counter-proposal, which properly addresses all areas of our claim, will be enough 
to prevent us serving notice of industrial action next week."
Ryanair Irish pilots back industrial action as unrest spreads
The union is required to give at least one week's notice before any strike.
Ryanair's main pilots union in Spain will vote in the coming days on possible industrial action, including strikes, in 
direct response to planned job cuts, the local SEPLA trade union said.
The airline cited delays in deliveries of Boeing's grounded 737 MAX jet as the reason for halving growth plans for 
next year. SEPLA said Ryanair has threatened to fire 100 pilots in Spain as part of those plans.
"Our group is nervous and fed up with the continued abuse by Ryanair," SEPLA said in a statement late on 
Thursday. "We are going to show them that we are willing to do everything possible to avoid these unnecessary 
dismissals."
In response, a spokeswoman for Ryanair reiterated that consultations are taking place with staff at bases affected 
by the planned winter closures.
Analysts at Goodbody Stockbrokers said that investor concern over an increasingly coordinated union response 
across Europe will be heightened by the possible action in Spain.
Ryanair shares were down 3.3% in early afternoon trade at 8.93 euros, their lowest in more than four-and-a-half 
years. (Reuters)

Irish-based pilots for Irish budget airline Ryanair warned on Friday of plans to strike, a union said.
The Irish union Forsa is required to give at least one week's strike notice and said it would notify management early 
next week unless the airline agrees to union pay proposals by Monday.
"At this stage, only a substantive counter-proposal, which properly addresses all areas of our claim, will be enough 
to prevent us serving notice of industrial action next week," Forsa assistant general secretary Ian McDonnell said in 
a statement.
A ballot on the strike saw 94 per cent of the union's members vote in favour. It was open for the about 180 directly-
employed Ryanair pilots based in Ireland who are members of the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association (IALPA). Ryanair 
pilots employed by agencies were not balloted.
The pilots are requesting wage hikes and better work conditions.
Ryanair countered that the labour action was supported by less than 25 per cent of Ryanair's Irish pilots, adding 
that "this disruption of customers' holiday plans has no valid mandate from Ryanair's Irish Pilots."
Earlier this week, British-based Ryanair pilots said they would strike for five days, August 22 and 23 as well as 
September 2-4, according to the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA).
Last year, strikes by Ryanair pilots across Europe resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the height of 
the summer holiday season in August and September.

Members of Irish pilots union Forsa have voted 94% in favour of taking industrial action against Ryanair in a row 
over pay.
Forsa says it will now write to Ryanair's management next week to give details of industrial action, including strikes, 
unless the airline agrees to the union's pay proposals by 12 August.
The union says that, under pay claims it submitted to the airline in March, Ryanair pilots would receive pay and 
conditions in line with industry norms.
Industrial action could still be avoided if the airline engages constructively in talks, states Forsa assistant general 
secretary Ian McDonnell. He accuses the company of using stalling tactics to delay negotiations.
"Ryanair's directly employed Irish-based pilots are simply seeking pay levels that are common and competitive in 
the commercial airline sector, from a company that made a more-than-healthy profit of 1 billion last year," he says.
"They feel they have been forced into contemplating potentially disruptive industrial action by a company that 
seems either unwilling or unable to negotiate in a professional and constructive manner. At this stage, only a 
substantive counter-proposal, which properly addresses all areas of our claim, will be enough to prevent us serving 
notice of industrial action next week."
Ryanair says it is "disappointed" that Forsa pilots are threatening to disrupt customers' travel plans, and argues that 
the union's motion to strike has the support of less than a quarter of the airline's Irish pilots.
"The result of Forsa's ballot shows that less than half of Ryanair’s Irish pilots are members of Forsa, and less than 
60% of these Forsa members participated in the ballot with less than 25% of Ryanair's Irish pilots voting for

industrial action. This disruption of customers' holiday plans has no valid mandate from Ryanair's Irish pilots," says 
the airline.
It highlights its collective agreements with Forsa on promotions, transfers, seniority and, in April, a pay increase of 
up to 20% for pilots who had not agreed a previous pay increase, and complains that the union failed to provide 
further specific pay proposals. The airline also asserts that its pilots earn more than those flying for either 
Norwegian or Jet2.
There are 180 directly employed Ryanair pilots based in Ireland, who as members of the Irish Air Line Pilots' 
Association (IALPA), which is part of Forsa, were eligible to vote in the ballot. Agency-employed pilots were not able 
to take part.
This latest industrial dispute with Ryanair comes in the same week that unions representing pilots in the UK and 
Spain said they were seeking strike action against the company in protest at pay, conditions and job cuts.

The latest arrival at British Airways marks the next step in the transformation of the carrier's fleet.
Under that modernisation process, old Boeing 767s have been phased out for 787s, and the superannuated 737-
400 fleet has been retired in favour of the Airbus A320neo.
James Mellon/Cirium
This time BA's new kid on the block is the A350-1000, the largest variant of the Airbus big twin.
These will begin the arguably long overdue process of supplanting the flag carrier's elderly 747-400s.
While there can be few rivals to the Queen of the Skies' crown, the economics are painfully obvious: BA expects the 
A350 to burn fuel at roughly half the rate of the 747, despite accommodating only six fewer passengers than the 
337-seat jumbo.
In addition, the Airbus platform allows BA to introduce its new business-class cabin, a product that will be rolled out 
across the fleet over the coming years.
Indeed, that same cabin will also feature on the 777Xs that are due to begin arriving in the early part of next 
decade. As it happens, these widebody twins will also replace 747s, as well as a handful of 777-200s.
This strategy makes sense within the wider context of parent company IAG, which is attempting to reduce fleet 
complexity across the group's airlines.
That has particular relevance in the short-haul operation, where the group has been seeking greater commonality of 
configuration, partly to save weight and partly to enable better operational flexibility.
OPINION: 737 Max might make sense for BA , despite fleet upset E The latest arrival at British Airways marks 
the next step in the transformation of the carrier'....
BA withdrew its last 737s in 2015 in favour of Airbus single-aisle jets, and sister operators Aer Lingus, Iberia and 
Vueling all fly A320-family aircraft.
Jets – or even crews, presumably – can now be switched between carriers should the need arise.
But the fly in the ointment is the 737 Max. At June's Paris air show, IAG tentatively committed to take up to 200 of 
the re-engined Boeing narrowbodies for BA, throwing that quest for commonality into question.
BA chief Alex Cruz argues that the arrival of the Max is not counter to the streamlining effort, claiming that with a big 
enough fleet a single type is less important.
Perhaps this is true. However, it is telling that the likes of EasyJet and Ryanair have profited in part from a rigid 
adherence to a single-type fleet and, save for the latter's Lauda offshoot, show no sign of abandoning this strategy.
What the addition of the re-engined 737 will bring, however, is better fleet resilience should one type be pulled from 
service for safety reasons.
It is perhaps ironic, though, that the still-grounded Max should provide that safety net.
IAG short-haul strategy?

Ryanair 's UK pilots vote to strike later this month
Ryanair's UK pilots vote to strike later this month

Members of Ryanair's British pilot union voted on Wednesday in favor of strike action later this month in a dispute 
over working conditions, the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) said.
According to the union, there will be a two-day strike from Aug. 22, and a second strike from the early hours of 
Sept. 2 until just before midnight on Sept. 4.
In an email sent by BALPA to its members, the union said its members had sent a "very clear and powerful 
message to the company," with 79.5% of the ballots cast backing the action.
"Notwithstanding the result of the industrial action ballot, BALPA remains committed to finding a negotiated and 
agreed settlement to the current trade dispute," it said.
The decision to strike is a setback for management at Europe's largest low-cost carrier, who in recent months said 
they had largely resolved an industrial relations dispute with pilots and cabin crew.
Ryanair said the strike action had the support of less than 30% of its pilots as only half were members of BALPA.
"This BALPA industrial action has no mandate from Ryanair pilots, is ill-timed just 10 weeks before Brexit, and will 
cause unnecessary disruption to customers holidays and travel plans," the airline said in a statement.
"We have written to BALPA asking them to return to talks, and we apologize sincerely to customers for any 
uncertainty that BALPA's ballot may cause them."
Ryanair 's UK pilots vote to strike later this month
Ryanair agreed in late 2017 to recognize unions for the first time, triggering a series of damaging strikes last year 
that ended when the airline signed collective labor agreements with several pilot unions throughout Europe.
But BALPA has said pilot union colleagues in Spain, Ireland, Sweden and Germany have made "little, if any, 
meaningful progress" in talks with Ryanair.
The budget airline’s Irish pilot union FORSA-IALPA is balloting members on possible strike action with results due 
by Friday.
The Irish union said there was "frustration and disappointment" among pilots over a lack of progress in ongoing pay 
talks with the company but did not say when strike action might take place.
Portuguese cabin crew union SNPVAC has given notice of five days of strike action from Aug. 21.
According to SNPVAC, the strike action is because Ryanair has not complied with a protocol signed last November, 
which the union said included holiday pay, 22 days of annual leave per year and full compliance with Portuguese 
parental law.
On Wednesday, the union said Ryanair would close its base at Faro International Airport in southern Portugal from 
next year with the loss of at least 120 jobs.
Ryanair told the union the decision to close the base, which operates 10 aircraft in summer, was part of wider 
planned cuts flagged last week due to weaker earnings, the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX and concerns over 
Brexit, said SNPVAC director Fernando Gandra.
Last week, Ryanair said it had 500 more pilots and 400 more cabin crew than needed, with job losses will be 
announced in the coming weeks. (Reuters)

allegedly pushing a staff member.Speaking to Mirror Online[1], 20-year-old Rafik Boutiche said a female staff 
member called police after objecting to him changing his seatin order to sit with a friend. He claimed she wrongly 
accused him of pushing her. 
Officers arrived and dragged him out of the flight. The exact date of the incident was not known.Video of the 
incident showed the officers dragging Boutiche with a co-passenger shouting 'You are hurting him.'After being 
removed from the plane, Boutiche along with his friend, 19-year-old Islam Fessih, stayed at a hotel in Portugal for 
another night.Speaking to the daily from the hotel, he said, "My hand is cut up, it's burning me at the moment. My 
ankle has been sprained and my neck is hurting me. We're just two young lads, we're not looking for trouble, we 
just wanted to get back home. I've never experienced anything like this, I never thought it was possible to go 
through what I've gone through. It's made me very emotional."Boutiche said he only wanted to move to the empty 
seat besidehis friend, something that everyone on the flight was doing.Fessiah said, "We realized there were a 
number of free spaces, we wanted to sit together so he tried to move forward. He sat in front of me because there 
was a free seat, but she said he had to move."He added that Boutiche may have accidentally come in contact with 
the staff member."He's a big lad. She ran to the other end of the plane and called police, we didn't know what was 
going on until police boarded the flight. We didn't know what was going on,' he added.Fessih also took to Twitter to 
say his friend was 'attacked.'"There was a free seat next to me but the air hostess refused to let him sit there and 
accused him of punching her when the whole plane has his side,' he wrote. In this representational photo, a Ryanair

THE GROUNDING of Boeing's 737 Max means at least 40m fewer aircraft seats are available this summer.
Aviation regulators across the globe grounded the new jet in March after two crashes triggered by a faulty anti-stall 
system killed 346 people.
Boeing hopes to get the plane in the air again by the end of October, but over the peak summer holiday period 
airlines' capacities have been severely hampered, according to aviation data firm OAG.
Norwegian Air, the biggest operator of the 737 Max which serves British passengers, has 2.2m fewer flight seats 
over the summer season than it projected earlier this year.
Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and United Airlines - three out of the four biggest US carriers - have more 
than 6.3m fewer seats on offer over the period in total.
The hardest-hit airline is China Southern Airlines, which has 3.6m fewer seats to sell to potential passengers this 
summer.
Air Canada has 3.3m fewer seats, while Tui Airways has cut capacity by 900,000. Tui operated the jet from 
Manchester airport until it was grounded.
Ryanair was omitted from the list, because it does not file data for the 737 Max specifically.
Aviation analyst John Grant said: "Last-minute schedule adjustments are we know challenging for any carrier, but 
the scale of the B737 Max grounding has been very disruptive for many."

British Airways chief Alex Cruz insists that introduction of the Boeing 737 Max would not contradict parent company 
IAG's efforts to simplify its short-haul fleet.
IAG has been engaged in an effort to achieve greater commonality of configuration between the Airbus A320-family 
jets across its group carriers.
This process is designed to achieve weight savings and allow greater flexibility to transfer aircraft between the IAG 
operators.
BA withdrew its last 737s in 2015, in favour of Airbus single-aisle jets, and IAG's Vueling, Iberia and Aer Lingus all 
use A320-family aircraft.
But the tentative IAG agreement for up to 200 737 Max jets would not necessarily upset this harmonisation, insists 
Cruz.
Speaking to FlightGlobal ahead of BA's inaugural A350-1000 service to Madrid, Cruz said the company had the 
production volume to support more than one provider.
"If you have 20 or 30 aircraft a single type is important," he says. "When you have 400 you have more flexibility."
He points out that Ryanair, an exclusive 737-800 operator, has reached the point where it can accommodate the 
Airbus operation of Austrian division Lauda.
Without specifically suggesting that Airbus delivery delays might have influenced the IAG decision, Cruz states that 
substantial adjustments to planning have to be made if individual aircraft do not arrive on time. "We have sufficient 
reason not to be happy," he adds.

BA has indicated that 737 Max operations would be conducted from London Gatwick, where the airline formerly 
used 737-400s.

LONDON (AP) - Ryanair pilots based in the U.K. have authorized a series of summer strikes in a dispute with the 
budget carrier over pay and benefits.
Members of the British Airline Pilots Association voted by a ratio of 4-to-1 in favor of the strikes set for Aug. 22-23 
and Sept. 2-4.
The union says the dispute involves pensions, loss of license insurance, maternity benefits, allowances, and pay.
Brian Strutton, the union's general secretary, said Wednesday that pilots don't want to disrupt passengers' travel 
plans, but "at the moment it seems we have no choice" because Ryanair hasn't made a formal offer to resolve the 
dispute.
A Ryanair spokesman says many of the airline's pilots aren't members of the union and that union members "have 
no mandate to disrupt our customers' holidays and flights."

Highlight: The European Commission (EC) has found that the marketing agreements concluded between the local

are illegal under EU state aid rules. Ryanair is being required to return EUR 8.5m in what the EC defined as illegal 
aid.

The European Commission (EC) has found that the marketing agreements concluded between the local 
Association for the Promotion of Touristic and Economic Flows (APFTE) and Ryanair at the airport of Montpellier 
are illegal under EU state aid rules. Ryanair is being required to return EUR 8.5m in what the EC defined as illegal 
aid. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: "Competition between airports and between airlines is 
crucial for consumers, growth and jobs. 
Our investigation showed that certain payments by the French local authorities in favour of Ryanair to promote 
Montpellier airport gave Ryanair an unfair and selective advantage over its competitors and caused harm to other 
regions and other regional airports. This is illegal under EU state aid rules. France must now recover the illegal 
state aid." Montpellier airport is a regional airport located in the French region of Occitanie. The airport served 
nearly 1.9 million passengers in 2018. Ryanair was present at the airport until April 2019. Following a complaint by 
a competitor of Ryanair, in July 2018 the Commission opened an in-depth investigation into marketing agreements 
between the Association for the Promotion of Touristic and Economic Flows (Association de Promotion des Flux 
Touristiques et Economiques, APFTE) and Ryanair and its subsidiary AMS. Between 2010 and 2017, APFTE 
concluded various marketing agreements with Ryanair and AMS, under which the airline and its subsidiary received 
payments worth around EUR 8.5m in exchange for promoting Montpellier and the surrounding area as a destination 
on Ryanair's website. The Commission's investigation revealed that: The agreements with Ryanair were financed 
through state resources and were attributable to the state. APFTE is an association unrelated to the airport 
operator, funded almost entirely by regional and local French public entities. These public entities closely control the 
use of the association's budget.The payments in favour of Ryanair on the basis of the marketing agreements did 
not correspond to effective marketing needs of APFTE but only served as an incentive for Ryanair to maintain its 
operations at Montpellier airport.APFTE either concluded the agreements directly with Ryanair and AMS and not 
France must recover EUR 8.5m in illegal aid to Ryanair
with other airlines or organised public tenders that were biased towards Ryanair.On this basis, the Commission 
found that the marketing agreements gave an undue and selective advantage to Ryanair over its competitors. The 
Commission therefore concluded that the agreements amounted to illegal and incompatible aid under EU State aid 
rules and that the advantage must be recovered. As a matter of principle, EU State aid rules require that 
incompatible state aid be recovered in order to remove the distortion of competition created by the aid. However, 
there are no fines under EU state aid rules and recovery does not penalise the company in question. It simply 
restores equal treatment with other companies.

Ryanair has decided to close its base at Faro International Airport in southern Portugal from next year with the loss 
of at least 120 jobs, the SNPVAC cabin crew union, which had called a strike for Aug. 21-25, said on Wednesday.
The budget airline told the union the decision to close the base, which operates 10 aircraft in summer, was part of 
wider planned cuts flagged last week due to weaker earnings, the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX and concerns 
over Brexit, said SNPVAC director Fernando Gandra.
The timing "appears at least strange as it comes within days of our calling a strike in Portugal and as the company 
is telling staff its passenger numbers have risen 9% in July from a year earlier," Gandra said.
"We are looking into the matter and collecting data to see if it could be retaliation for the strike," Gandra said.

British-based pilots for Irish budget airline Ryanair plan to strike for a total of five days at the end of August and 
early September, a union said Wednesday.
The strike will take place on August 22 and 23 as well as September 2-4, the British Airline Pilots Association 
(BALPA) said in a statement.
Last year, strikes by Ryanair pilots across Europe resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the height of 
this year's summer holiday season in August and September.
"We have had no formal offer from Ryanair and it is imperative that we resolve this dispute urgently to avoid strike 
action," BALPA general secretary Brian Strutton said.
"No pilot wants to spoil the public's travel plans but at the moment it seems we have no choice."
A ballot on the strikes saw 80 per cent of the union's members vote in favour, with a member turnout of 72 per cent.
The strike was called due to disagreements over pay structure, pensions, license insurance and other benefits.

RYANAIR's passenger numbers grew to 14.8m in July, a nine per cent increase on the same period the year 
before.
Ryanair carried 14.2m passengers, while Lauda, the lowcost Austrian airline acquired by Ryanair, carried 600,000.
Despite the traffic growth, Ryanair has entered turbulent territory, having issued a number of profit warnings.
Last week Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary warned staff that hundreds of jobs could be lost as the airline reels from a 
decline in earnings and the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft.
In a video sent to workers and seen by Bloomberg, the airline chief executive told staff that Ryanair needs 900 
fewer pilots and cabin crew than initially planned due to the airline's poor financial performance and the continued 
grounding of the Boeing 737, which has hurt its growth and cut flight numbers.
Earlier in July Ryanair revealed that profit had nosedived by 21 per cent in the first quarter, which the airline blamed 
on hikes in the cost of fuel and staff. Airfares also dropped considerably, as competition increased in Germany after 
Lufthansa bought Air Berlin.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary has expressed concern about slips in the timeframe for the Boeing 737 
Max’s expected return to service.
The budget carrier said on 16 July that it expected the Max to be back in service by December, but after reporting 
first-quarter results O’Leary on 29 July said that this now seemed like it would slip into January 2020.
“We were expecting 58 aircraft for summer 2020; that’s now 30 at best. It may well move to 20, could move to 10, 
or zero if Boeing don’t get their sh*t together pretty quickly with the regulators,” he says.
O’Leary says the latest he had heard from Boeing was that it now plans to submit the software amendment in 
October, rather than September.
“It’s very difficult to deal with the Boeing delays, because they keep getting delayed further and further. Up until mid-
July, we were expecting them to be back flying in September. Now it looks like January next year,” he says.
Ryanair will not be taking delivery of any Max aircraft until the type has been declared safe to fly by both US and 
European regulators, O’Leary says.
The carrier is in talks with Boeing over a new aircraft order for the period from 2023 onwards, O’Leary reveals, but 
he says those discussions are being hindered by the airframer’s “inability” to get the Max back into service. Ryanair 
is also in talks with Airbus, which is pricing “very aggressively” at the moment, he notes.

Highlight: London's Gatwick Airport has inaugurated a new South Terminal arrivals route for passengers travelling 
from other parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
Body
The dedicated facility has been developed with a £24m investment and will allow passengers to use a jetty or 
aircraft steps to disembark from their flight and move straight into the terminal building. The airport has also 
installed a dedicated baggage reclaim belt to facilitate the quick and convenient collection of luggage, while also 
freeing up capacity for international passengers. Gatwick Airport said that the investment forms part of its £1.11bn 
Capital Investment Programme and VINCI Airports' commitment to optimise the infrastructure of its airports. 
Gatwick terminal operations head Andy Pule said: "We are always looking for ways to improve the experience of 
passengers who travel through Gatwick, and this is a great example of how we invest in existing infrastructure to 
facilitate growth while also improving service for all. "UK and Republic of Ireland passengers are frequent visitors to 
Gatwick and use the airport as a transit point into London, or to connect with the rest of the world." The airport has 
also invested in e-gates and biometric technology, which has transformed the gate room process by using more 
efficient self-service. Gatwick is using Iris recognition and reconciliation technology to differentiate UK and Republic 
of Ireland passengers from international travellers on the departure journey. The investment will be beneficial for 
passengers arriving from locations such as Guernsey, Glasgow, Dublin, and Cork with airlines including British 
Airways, Aurigny, Aer Lingus, and Ryanair. Gatwick is the UK's second-largest airport, serving more than 230 
destinations in 74 countries for 46 million passengers per annum. The airport recently released its final master plan 
for optimising its capacity, which details how the airport will use its existing runways more effectively to meet 
growing demand over the next 15 years.

have given in. Surrendered.
ICapitulated completely. To Ryanair. Like many of you, I have been living in a state of almost constant warfare 
against the budget airline pretty much since its inception. Yet I can't quite stop travelling with them.
I live in the north and we don't get the same choice of carrier you get down south. If I want to go to Rome on any 
given day in the summer, for example, odds are I either go on Ryanair or via somewhere I don't much want to go.
But I also have hideous memories of being left in boiling hot information-free corridors with small babies in Malaga. I 
can't quite forget the time I forgot my boarding pass and had to pay an insane amount of cash to get it reissued at 
the airport. I can't erase the misery of not making it to the front of the queue to board, back when you didn't get an 
allocated seat, and having to ask the entire plane to Rubik's Cube themselves around so I could sit next to my kids.
And if I type Ryanair into my inbox, much of what comes up is failed attempts to get compensation for a lengthy 
delay in 2015. All this has long made it impossible for me to give the airline a penny more than I have to. Think no 
priority boarding, no luggage, no pre-booked seats and most definitely no Pringles on board. Ever. Until now.
Why? I still loathe Ryanair's nasty system of making you pay extra for seats if you want to check in long enough in 
advance to print the boarding passes for your return flights before you embark on the outbound leg of your holiday. 
And I resent the general luggage confusion and costs. But I have finally realised that my own peace of mind is more 
important than a battle the budget airlines don't even know I am waging.
Life's too short not to pay for holiday extras
So I buy advance seat reservations.
Both ways. I pay for whatever luggage means I won't feel tense on the way to the gate - even if I end up with less 
than I booked. And while priority boarding still seems stupid (considering you've paid to book a seat with 
guaranteed cabin bag) I also now happily pay for fast track security. It costs £5 per head to not have to queue or 
(crucially) worry about time spent queueing. On a hot Friday, this can feel like something of a bargain. As, for that 
matter, can a few packets of Pringles bought on board to give everyone a break from playing Uno.
It isn't just budget airlines I have given in to. My surrender extends to car hire. After a nightmare with Goldcar a few 
years ago, I no longer go budget (here I do have a choice). I don't want to walk a mile to a desk outside the arrivals 
terminal, and I don't want to spend the two weeks after my holiday arguing about a £350 charge for a slow 
puncture.
I also don't want to rent cars from companies that partner with the budget airlines I fly with - why stand in a queue 
with everyone else who just got off my flight? Instead I have upgraded to Hertz Gold and Avis Preferred (this is free 
to do). They have all my details in their systems already. Once I've booked online, all I have to do is turn up and go 
(you mostly get to jump any queue there is, or even skip the terminal desk and head straight for the car park).
This matters more at some airports that others - yes, Toulouse, I am talking about you. At Bristol airport last week, I 
had the keys in my hand after one quick flash of my driving licence. From landing in my prebooked EasyJet seat to 
reversing out of my parking space took around 20 minutes. Bliss. You also get an automatic upgrade if one is 
available.
The big car rental firms are far from perfect, but they are certainly more satisfactory than some of the less well 
known. The last time I rented a car from Hertz, it had a dent in the side already. I had a tangle with a gate post and 
made that dent rather worse. They didn't charge me. Others would have. Indeed, they often have.
Hence my final travel capitulation - to American Express - which covers all my travel insurances. A good 70 per cent 
of people believe they are better than average drivers. I am not one of those people. My platinum Amex covers all 
travel insurance (note: not anything related to pre-existing medical conditions) and all excess on car hire.
I've used the latter. I called them. They sorted it, with almost no admin involved. You can, of course, buy standalone 
excess policies for around £50 a year from a variety of firms and travel insurance too, but for me that's just another 
thing either to forget or feel tense about.
Otherwise, there are credit cards and packaged bank accounts that come with insurance. Which?, the consumer 
group, has just done a survey of all of them. The top offer comes from Nationwide with its FlexPlus account - travel 
insurance, mobile phone cover and breakdown cover for £156 a year.
Second is First Direct's First Directory account - all of the above but with a higher mobile claim limit (£1,500) for 
£180 a year, although you do have to put £1,000 a month into the account to get the benefits. As an extra, the 
platinum Amex also comes with two priority passes, each of which let two people into most airport lounges.
This is the kind of thing I would have dismissed as a pointless luxury a few years www.ago.No more. I travel a lot 
with my husband and children. They are always hungry. We could queue at Costa and spend £25 a go (feeling 
stressed as everyone's blood sugar collapses). Or we could go into the lounge and not queue, not spend £25 and 
not feel stressed.
Finally, the card allows me to call or email the platinum travel people and get them to book my rental cars and 
hotels for me. That helps too. I have nightmares about forgetting to book my car with my Amex, crashing and not 
being insured. Get Amex to do the booking and that can't happen.
It's expensive - really expensive - at £450 a year and is soon to rise to £575. But as you might have begun to grasp, 
it is the kind of expensive that if used extensively translates into value. Or value to me www.anyway.No one 
Life's too short not to pay for holiday extras
enjoyed travelling with me during the long war of travel attrition. Things are better now I see travelling as part of the 
trip rather than as a pennypinching battle. See you in the lounge.

Both ways. I pay for whatever luggage means I won't feel tense on the way to the gate - even if I end up with less 
than I booked. And while priority boarding still seems stupid (considering you've paid to book a seat with 
guaranteed cabin bag) I also now happily pay for fast track security. It costs £5 per head to not have to queue or 
(crucially) worry about time spent queueing. On a hot Friday, this can feel like something of a bargain. As, for that 
matter, can a few packets of Pringles bought on board to give everyone a break from playing Uno.
It isn't just budget airlines I have given in to. My surrender extends to car hire. After a nightmare with Goldcar a few 
years ago, I no longer go budget (here I do have a choice). I don't want to walk a mile to a desk outside the arrivals 
terminal, and I don't want to spend the two weeks after my holiday arguing about a £350 charge for a slow 
puncture.
I also don't want to rent cars from companies that partner with the budget airlines I fly with - why stand in a queue 
with everyone else who just got off my flight? Instead I have upgraded to Hertz Gold and Avis Preferred (this is free 
to do). They have all my details in their systems already. Once I've booked online, all I have to do is turn up and go 
(you mostly get to jump any queue there is, or even skip the terminal desk and head straight for the car park).
This matters more at some airports that others - yes, Toulouse, I am talking about you. At Bristol airport last week, I 
had the keys in my hand after one quick flash of my driving licence. From landing in my prebooked EasyJet seat to 
reversing out of my parking space took around 20 minutes. Bliss. You also get an automatic upgrade if one is 
available.
The big car rental firms are far from perfect, but they are certainly more satisfactory than some of the less well 
known. The last time I rented a car from Hertz, it had a dent in the side already. I had a tangle with a gate post and 
made that dent rather worse. They didn't charge me. Others would have. Indeed, they often have.
Hence my final travel capitulation - to American Express - which covers all my travel insurances. A good 70 per cent 
of people believe they are better than average drivers. I am not one of those people. My platinum Amex covers all 
travel insurance (note: not anything related to pre-existing medical conditions) and all excess on car hire.
I've used the latter. I called them. They sorted it, with almost no admin involved. You can, of course, buy standalone 
excess policies for around £50 a year from a variety of firms and travel insurance too, but for me that's just another 
thing either to forget or feel tense about.
Otherwise, there are credit cards and packaged bank accounts that come with insurance. Which?, the consumer 
group, has just done a survey of all of them. The top offer comes from Nationwide with its FlexPlus account - travel 
insurance, mobile phone cover and breakdown cover for £156 a year.
Second is First Direct's First Directory account - all of the above but with a higher mobile claim limit (£1,500) for 
£180 a year, although you do have to put £1,000 a month into the account to get the benefits. As an extra, the 
platinum Amex also comes with two priority passes, each of which let two people into most airport lounges.
This is the kind of thing I would have dismissed as a pointless luxury a few years www.ago.No more. I travel a lot 
with my husband and children. They are always hungry. We could queue at Costa and spend £25 a go (feeling 
stressed as everyone's blood sugar collapses). Or we could go into the lounge and not queue, not spend £25 and 
not feel stressed.
Finally, the card allows me to call or email the platinum travel people and get them to book my rental cars and 
hotels for me. That helps too. I have nightmares about forgetting to book my car with my Amex, crashing and not 
being insured. Get Amex to do the booking and that can't happen.
It's expensive - really expensive - at £450 a year and is soon to rise to £575. But as you might have begun to grasp, 
it is the kind of expensive that if used extensively translates into value. Or value to me www.anyway.No one

have given in. Surrendered.
ICapitulated completely. To Ryanair. Like many of you, I have been living in a state of almost constant warfare 
against the budget airline pretty much since its inception. Yet I can't quite stop travelling with them.
I live in the north and we don't get the same choice of carrier you get down south. If I want to go to Rome on any 
given day in the summer, for example, odds are I either go on Ryanair or via somewhere I don't much want to go.
But I also have hideous memories of being left in boiling hot information-free corridors with small babies in Malaga. I 
can't quite forget the time I forgot my boarding pass and had to pay an insane amount of cash to get it reissued at 
the airport. I can't erase the misery of not making it to the front of the queue to board, back when you didn't get an 
allocated seat, and having to ask the entire plane to Rubik's Cube themselves around so I could sit next to my kids.
And if I type Ryanair into my inbox, much of what comes up is failed attempts to get compensation for a lengthy 
delay in 2015. All this has long made it impossible for me to give the airline a penny more than I have to. Think no 
priority boarding, no luggage, no pre-booked seats and most definitely no Pringles on board. Ever. Until now.
Why? I still loathe Ryanair's nasty system of making you pay extra for seats if you want to check in long enough in 
advance to print the boarding passes for your return flights before you embark on the outbound leg of your holiday. 
And I resent the general luggage confusion and costs. But I have finally realised that my own peace of mind is more 
important than a battle the budget airlines don't even know I am waging.

W hen, in 1999, British Airways showed me the mock-ups of its new flatbed business class seats, the idea was 
considered so high-class that my writeup appeared in How To Spend It magazine (my first and only appearance in 
the FT's style bible).
BA had other ideas that seemed wildly futuristic back then. It was going to provide personalised jet-lag advice to its 
high-paying customers. They would tap their details into a palm-held computer that would give them a diet exercise 
and sleeping programme in the days leading up to their flights. The airline was even trying out electronic books. "It's 
a novel-book size with a screen," a BA tech guru told me. Imagine.
What was once innovative becomes ordinary very quickly, and BA's previously pioneering offerings have been 
looking tired for a while. Many other airlines' business class sections have for years outclassed BA's. Particular 
scorn has been directed at BA's one forward-facing, one backward-facing seat-pairs which, crammed into the cabin, 
mean that window-side travellers have to step over fellow-passengers' outstretched legs to get to the toilets.
BA's outmoded business class seats are of a piece with its current positioning, perceived by many travellers as 
slightly ahead of EasyJet and Ryanair and miles behind Emirates and Singapore Airlines. BA has promised a 
refresh, with new planes and fittings, and last week the airline once again showed off new business class seats.
How do they look? Pretty good. The backward-facing seats have gone. The configuration is one-two-one: a lone 
window seat on either side of the plane, with immediate aisle access, and two seats in the middle.
Business travel
The seat material, a dark wool blend with white stitching, looks classy and feels comfortable. The seat stretches flat 
to reach a footrest that is fixed rather than having to be lowered. Passengers will be allowed to store shoes, or 
anything else, beneath the footrests during take-off and landing, rather than having to clear the floor.
There are several small storage spaces, one with USB and universal plug sockets, another that swings open to 
provide a seat-level mirror. The lighting and seat-pitch controls, on a small-screen panel, look easier to manage 
than the old set-up.
The 18.5-inch video screen is fixed facing the seat, so that it doesn't have to be swung open and closed. This 
means passengers can watch films from boarding to alighting, without having to fold the screen away. The dining 
tray is stowed beneath the screen and slides out easily to lap level for eating and drinking.
BA seems proudest of the doors that can be closed to seal off each business class seat. This is not a new idea - 
Qatar Airways and Delta Air Lines have doors too - but they add some privacy.
The dividing partitions between the two middle seats are also an improvement. They look more solid than the old 
ones and, best of all, do not have to be lowered during take-off and landing. If two people are travelling together, 
they can still see each other when the partition is down, although they will feel less cosy than in the old BA business 
class. But then everything will feel a little less cosy, which, to most, will be a relief.
The new set-up will appear on four new Airbus A350s that BA will receive this year. The airline will also begin 
retrofitting its Boeing 777s and 787s. (Its 747s are being phased out.) One BA A350 will make flights from London 
to Madrid from August 5, before the new seats make their long-haul debut to Dubai in September.
Will the seats return BA to being the world's favourite airline? Probably not. But at least the one-time pioneer will 
look less of a laggard.

Will the seats return BA to being the world's favourite airline? Probably not. But at least the one-time pioneer will 
look less of a laggard.

W hen, in 1999, British Airways showed me the mock-ups of its new flatbed business class seats, the idea was 
considered so high-class that my writeup appeared in How To Spend It magazine (my first and only appearance in 
the FT's style bible).
BA had other ideas that seemed wildly futuristic back then. It was going to provide personalised jet-lag advice to its 
high-paying customers. They would tap their details into a palm-held computer that would give them a diet exercise 
and sleeping programme in the days leading up to their flights. The airline was even trying out electronic books. "It's 
a novel-book size with a screen," a BA tech guru told me. Imagine.
What was once innovative becomes ordinary very quickly, and BA's previously pioneering offerings have been 
looking tired for a while. Many other airlines' business class sections have for years outclassed BA's. Particular 
scorn has been directed at BA's one forward-facing, one backward-facing seat-pairs which, crammed into the cabin, 
mean that window-side travellers have to step over fellow-passengers' outstretched legs to get to the toilets.
BA's outmoded business class seats are of a piece with its current positioning, perceived by many travellers as 
slightly ahead of EasyJet and Ryanair and miles behind Emirates and Singapore Airlines. BA has promised a 
refresh, with new planes and fittings, and last week the airline once again showed off new business class seats.
How do they look? Pretty good. The backward-facing seats have gone. The configuration is one-two-one: a lone 
window seat on either side of the plane, with immediate aisle access, and two seats in the middle.
Business travel
The seat material, a dark wool blend with white stitching, looks classy and feels comfortable. The seat stretches flat 
to reach a footrest that is fixed rather than having to be lowered. Passengers will be allowed to store shoes, or 
anything else, beneath the footrests during take-off and landing, rather than having to clear the floor.
There are several small storage spaces, one with USB and universal plug sockets, another that swings open to 
provide a seat-level mirror. The lighting and seat-pitch controls, on a small-screen panel, look easier to manage 
than the old set-up.
The 18.5-inch video screen is fixed facing the seat, so that it doesn't have to be swung open and closed. This 
means passengers can watch films from boarding to alighting, without having to fold the screen away. The dining 
tray is stowed beneath the screen and slides out easily to lap level for eating and drinking.
BA seems proudest of the doors that can be closed to seal off each business class seat. This is not a new idea - 
Qatar Airways and Delta Air Lines have doors too - but they add some privacy.
The dividing partitions between the two middle seats are also an improvement. They look more solid than the old 
ones and, best of all, do not have to be lowered during take-off and landing. If two people are travelling together, 
they can still see each other when the partition is down, although they will feel less cosy than in the old BA business 
class. But then everything will feel a little less cosy, which, to most, will be a relief.
The new set-up will appear on four new Airbus A350s that BA will receive this year. The airline will also begin 
retrofitting its Boeing 777s and 787s. (Its 747s are being phased out.) One BA A350 will make flights from London

EU: Ryanair must repay 8.5 million euros of French state aid
EU: Ryanair must repay 8.5 million euros of French state aid

Ryanair must pay back 8.5 million euros (9.4 million dollars) of illegal aid received from the French state, the 
European Commission said on Friday.
Ryanair and its subsidiary AMS received funds to promote on its website Montpellier and its environs as a tourist 
destination from the publicly-funded French tourism association APFTE, the commission found.
Between 2010 and 2017, these payments "gave Ryanair an unfair and selective advantage over its competitors" 
and also harmed other airports, EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.
The investigation into Ryanair's marketing activities for Montpellier Airport, which saw a footfall of close to 1.9 
million in 2019, was launched last year after a complaint from a competitor. As of April, the Irish airline no longer 
flies from Montpellier.
Last November, French authorities briefly impounded a Ryanair plane at Bordeaux airport to force the airline to pay 
another fine.
In 2014, the commission ordered Ryanair to repay approximately 868,000 euros in the case of the Angouleme 
airport near to Bordeaux, 2.4 million euros in the case of the Pau airport, and 6.4 million euros in the case of the 
Nimes airport.

Irish low-cost operator Ryanair has told staff to expect job cuts in the coming months.
In a video – part of which has been seen by FlightGlobal and confirmed as genuine by the carrier – chief executive 
Michael O'Leary states that the airline already has "a surplus of over 500 pilots and some 400 cabin crew", which 
he says is a consequence of resignations falling "to effectively zero since January 2019".
That drop in staff leaving the business coincides with the budget airline's moves towards recognising unions.
He also notes in the video that delays to deliveries of Ryanair's first Boeing 737 Max aircraft will contribute to the 
overstaffing situation. During the airline’s earnings call on 29 July, he had already publicly warned of base closures 
as a result of the Max delays.
"The Max delivery delays mean that instead of taking 58 new aircraft for summer 2020, we will now, at best, get 
only 30 of those aircraft, which means we will need about 600 less pilots and cabin crew for summer 2020," O’Leary 
says in the video.
Ryanair had been due to receive its first 737 Max in April 2019, but Boeing suspended deliveries in March in the 
wake of the type's global grounding which followed the Ethiopian Airlines crash.
The job and base cuts could begin at the end of this year's summer season, O’Leary states.
The Ryanair chief also bemoans the impacts of Brexit – specifically warning that a no-deal Brexit could damage 
operations at its Irish and UK bases – and higher fuel and staffing costs.
On 29 July, Ryanair announced that its first-quarter net profit had fallen by over 20% to 243 million ($270 million), 
but that the company was maintaining its full-year profit estimate of 750-950 million.
 E Ryanair plans job cuts amid Max delays and lack of resignations; Irish low-cost operator Ryanair has told 
staff to expect job cuts in the coming months.
While revenues were up 11% to 2.3 billion over the three-month period, the airline has suffered from weakness in

British Airways has not detected any change in ticket bookings as a result of uncertainty around Brexit.
"We are not seeing any evidence of the Brexit impact," said Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA parent IAG, during a 
results briefing today.
He acknowledges that Ryanair and other airlines have warned how their operations could be affected, especially by 
a no-deal Brexit. But he insists: "We don't see any impact on bookings or the profile of bookings going forward in 
terms of the visibility that we have."
Walsh suspects that BA's heavy reliance on London and the UK southeast may be one explanation for the carrier's 
apparent resilience. "Maybe we are not exposed to the whole of the UK as they [competitors] would be," he says.
Nevertheless, BA has put in place contingency plans for the UK's scheduled departure from the EU on 31 October. 
These, Walsh notes, are based on "a sensible Brexit". He says the carrier will be flexible in adjusting capacity if 
bookings fluctuate.
As BA's fleet of 33 Boeing 747s is "nearly fully" depreciated and a number of early 777-200s are "effectively" fully 
depreciated, the carrier would be able to park aircraft relatively easily if capacity had to be reduced.
Within its short-haul operations, BA could return leased aircraft to their owners or transfer equipment to IAG sister 
carriers, Wash also notes.
He sees IAG as having "a lot of flexibility" as regards deployment of its fleet.
The group could, he suggests, benefit from other airlines' disappearance in the event of a downturn.
BA sees no impact on bookings from Brexit uncertainty; British Airways has not detected any change in ticket 
bookings as a result of uncertainty around Brexit.
IAG is in an "extremely strong [position] relatively to others", argues Walsh. "Anything that is going to impact on us 
is going to have a huge disproportionate impact on a lot of airlines out there who are in a very weak position today."
Noting that IAG has been through previous economic downturns, he adds: "We know what to do."
Walsh cites also IAG's "determination" to assert its position in the market.

Ryanair's Portuguese cabin crew trade union SNPVAC said on Thursday its members would go on strike for five 
days from Aug. 21.
The industrial action comes as Ryanair pilots in Ireland and the United Kingdom are holding ballots on a possible 
strike action in August.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, suffered a series of damaging strikes last year. Management say 
significant progress has been made since, with collective labour agreements concluded with a number of pilot 
unions throughout Europe.
But SNPVAC said Ryanair has refused to comply with a protocol signed last November, which it said included 
holiday pay, 22 days of annual leave per year and full compliance with Portuguese parental law.
"Strike notice for all cabin crew duties between 00:00 of the 21st of August until 23:29 of 25th of August was sent 
today to all the relevant entities," the union said in a statement.
Ryanair did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reuters)

French authorities have been instructed to recover 8.5 million ($9.4 million) of illegal state aid from budget carrier 
Ryanair, over a marketing agreement associated with Montpellier airport.
The European Commission says the aid was incompatible with European regulations on public support.
"Certain payments by the French local authorities in favour of Ryanair to promote Montpellier airport gave Ryanair 
an unfair and selective advantage over its competitors," says competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Investigation into the marketing agreement followed a complaint about Ryanair from a competitor a year ago.
Ryanair was operating at Montpellier up to April this year. The Commission says that payments worth 8.5 million – 
in exchange for promotional activity – were received by the airline and a subsidiary over 2010-17.
These payments were financed through French state resources, it adds, funded mainly by regional and local public 
entities.
"[They] only served as an incentive for Ryanair to maintain its operations at Montpellier airport," says the 
Commission, adding that France "must now recover" the illegal state aid from Ryanair.

MILAN (AP) - A court in Rome has confirmed a 1.85 million-euro ($2 million) fine against low-cost carrier Ryanair 
for improperly cancelling numerous flights during September and October 2017.
News agency ANSA said the court on Thursday rejected appeals by the Irish carrier to the fine levied by Italian anti-
trust authorities for unfair commercial practices after it cancelled flights due to previously known organizational or 
management issues.
In addition, anti-trust authorities said that Ryanair misled passengers by offering to either refund or change the 
ticket, without informing them of further rights to compensation.
Under EU regulations, passengers are due compensation for cancelled flights if informed within 14 days of the 
scheduled departure, as long as the airline cannot claim extraordinary circumstances.

Ryanair is facing 900 job cuts after the low-cost airline said it would cut flights next summer and potentially close 
some European bases as a result of the grounding of Boeing's 737 Max jet.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the Irish low-cost carrier, told staff it has 500 more pilots and 400 more cabin 
crew than required with job losses due to be announced in the next few weeks.
The latest setback comes after the carrier announced a 24 per cent fall in pre-tax profit in the first quarter of the 
year amid increasingly tough conditions in the European short-haul market.
Mr O'Leary, who warned of the job cuts at Monday's results announcement, revealed the depth of the problems in a 
video to staff, with 10 per cent of the company's pilots facing the axe out of a total of about 5,500 pilots.
Ryanair's total staff number was 16,800 in the year to March 31, according to the company's annual report, which 
was released on Tuesday.
Mr O'Leary added that problems were not helped by the low numbers of staff leaving the company. "Resignations 
have dried up to effectively zero since January 2019," he said in the video.
He also warned that the threat of a no-deal Brexit was adding to the airline's problems. "Adding to these challenges 
in the last number of weeks is the increasing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit in just 12 weeks' time," he said.
Ryanair targets 900 jobs after grounding of Boeing Max jets; Airlines
This could be damaging to the group's UK and some Irish bases, which are "heavily dependent on people travelling 
between Ireland and the UK".
Mr O'Leary is starting a series of discussions with its airports to determine which of its underperformers would take 
a hit as it makes cuts to bases and routes because of the possible delay to deliveries of 737 Max 200s, a variant of 
the 737 Max 8 aircraft.
While Mr O'Leary still expects to take 30 aircraft - of an original 58 - by next May, he warned this could be reduced, 
depending on when the Max jet is certified to fly. The shortfall led the airline to reduce the number of passengers it 
expects to carry in the year to March 2021 to 157m, from the 162m previously forecast.
Mr O'Leary has also agreed to take a 50 per cent cut in base pay to (EURO)500,000 a year in a five-year contract 
that started on April 1, according the company's annual report. Additionally, he will take a 50 per cent cut to his 
maximum annual bonus, giving it an upper limit of (EURO)500,000.

BRITISH Airways has lost its bid to block pilots from striking later this summer over a pay dispute, in a result which 
could spell chaos for British holidaymakers.
The airline has been in talks with pilots union British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) in an attempt to stop them 
striking over the summer months. After pilots voted to strike after rejecting a pay increase of 11.5 per cent over 
three years, BA took the case to the High Court last month.
After that was dismissed, the airline attempted to appeal against the decision. The Court of Appeal yesterday 
rejected the attempt.
The airline has said the pay rise is "fair and generous". BA pilots will join Heathrow and Gatwick airport staff in 
striking this summer. Ryanair pilots are also in the process of deciding whether to go on strike.
Balpa chief executive Brian Strutton described British Airways' actions as an attempt to "injunct this industrial action 
on a technicality".
"BA's attempt to defeat the democratic view of their pilots in court, rather than deal with us across the negotiating 
table, has sadly wasted huge amounts of time and money that could have been put into finding a peaceful 
resolution.
"Now the window for negotiation and compromise is closing fast."
Balpa has said BA's recent profits mean its members deserve a better offer. So far it has not announced any strike 
dates because it wants to resolve the issue through negotiation.
BA loses bid to block strikes by pilots over pay
The union met BA again at conciliation service Acas yesterday and will do so for the rest of the week for "one last 
try" to resolve the dispute.
A British Airways spokesperson said: "We are disappointed that the pilots' union, Balpa, has chosen to threaten the 
holidays of thousands of our customers this summer with unprecedented strike action."
They apologised for the "disruption Balpa's strike action will cause our customers".
The union must give BA 14 days notice before any strike goes ahead.
"We continue to pursue every avenue to find a solution to avoid industrial action and protect our customers' travel 
plans," said the airline.

Wizz Air has retained its investment grade credit rating with Fitch Ratings as the agency praised the Budapest-
based carrier's liquidity, cost base and market position. 
Fitch affirmed Wizz's long-term issuer default rating at 'BBB' with a stable outlook as well as its senior unsecured 
rating at 'BBB'.
The ratings agency added that Wizz is "well-placed for Brexit" due to its diversified route network and after 
obtaining a UK air operator's certificate.
Fitch also noted that Wizz's unit costs in the last financial year were better than almost all other rated low-cost 
carriers in the US and Europe, and close to those of Ryanair, which it rates 'BBB+'.
Wizz was also praised for having one of the best liquidity ratios in the industry, "although its gross leverage and 
FFO fixed charge cover remain weaker than peers". 
Fitch expects Wizz's margins to remain broadly flat in the next two years, while noting that "the annual delivery of 
about 20 aircraft may stretch management's capabilities as well as internal systems and processes".
However, it also pointed out that Wizz's shift towards larger narrowbodies should strengthen its already enviable 
cost position.

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary yesterday warned staff that hundreds of jobs could be lost as the airline reels from 
a decline in earnings and the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft.
In a video sent to workers and seen by Bloomberg, the airline chief executive told staff that Ryanair needs 900 
fewer pilots and cabin crew than initially planned due to the airline's poor financial performance and the continued 
grounding of the Boeing 737, which has hurt its growth and cut flight numbers.
"We over the next couple of weeks will be doing our very best to minimise job losses, but some are unavoidable at 
this time," O'Leary said.
Last week, O'Leary warned he could not rule out job losses if the jet remains grounded for longer than expected.
He slammed Boeing over the controversy, saying his airline could have no Boeing 737 Max jets available next year 
unless the aircraft manufacturer "gets its sh*t together".

Ryanair has 500 more pilots and 400 more cabin crew than needed, and job losses will be announced in the 
coming weeks, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told staff in a video message.
The comments come less than two years after Europe's biggest budget airline was forced to cancel hundreds of 
flights, due in part to a shortage of pilots.
However, the Irish company had flagged job losses on Monday when it reported a sharp fall in profits, and said 
earlier this month it was halving growth plans for next year due to delays in deliveries of Boeing's grounded 737 
MAX jet.
"We hope to preserve as many jobs as we can, but we have to respond now and we have to respond quickly to the 
MAX aircraft delivery delays and to the threat of a no-deal Brexit at the end of October," O'Leary said in the video 
posted after Monday's results.
He added job cuts would take place at around the end of September and again after Christmas.
Ryanair pilots in Britain and Ireland are holding a ballot over potential industrial action and some union officials, who 
declined to be identified, said O'Leary was trying to deter them from voting to strike.
They said a hiring agency that worked with Ryanair was still advertising for flight staff and earlier this month the 
airline had launched a new pilot training program in central Europe. (Reuters)

After confirmation it has been in talks with Dutch firm www.Takeaway.com about a potential £9bn merger, Just Eat 
could be poised to take an even bigger bite out of the food delivery market. Liberum analysts are optimistic about 
the possible deal, saying the merged group would "operate as market leader" in both the UK and the Netherlands, 
as well as being more cost efficient. The analysts are certainly hungry for more, maintaining Just Eat's "Buy" rating, 
with a target share price of 1,360p, significantly larger than yesterday's close of 750p.
Ryanair may not be flying high for a while. First-quarter results on Monday saw profits nosedive 21 per cent as the 
airline was hit by higher fuel and staff costs, coupled with lower fares. Boss Michael O'Leary, never one to mince 
words, then fired a shot at Boeing, saying his company could have no 737 Max jets available this year unless the 
manufacturer "gets its sh*t together". Barclays analysts were slightly more restrained, saying simply that Ryanair 
"still faces a number of uncertainty over the coming months". They rate it as "Overweight", with a target price of 
(EURO)11.70.
Unilever may be due a makeover, with organic sales growth staying stubbornly at the bottom of its three to five per 
cent target range. Liberum analysts say this is "especially painful in light of Unilever's high emerging market 
exposure" (60 per cent of group sales), and warn that the cosmetic giant's 20 per cent margin target could prove 
unsustainable long term if further investment is required to stimulate top-line growth". Nevertheless, Liberum has 
faith that Unilever will be able to clean up its finances, maintaining its "Hold" rating and raising its target price to 
4,735p.

 Ryanair's (RYAAY) CEO Michael O'Leary warned the airline's employees in a video message that as many as 900 
job cuts are on the way, according to media reports.
O'Leary said that Ryanair had an excess of more than 500 pilots and about 400 cabin crew. He added that the 
airline will need 600 fewer people in those roles next summer because of the grounding of Boeing's (BA) 737 Max 
airplane.

Ryanair profit slumps 21% as overcapacity drives fares down
Ryanair profit slumps 21% as overcapacity drives fares down

Ryanair reported a 21% drop in quarterly profit on Monday as overcapacity and a price war in Germany drove ticket 
prices lower, but the airline kept its profit target for the year unchanged.
Shares in Europe's largest low-cost carrier have almost halved in value in two years as the company deals with 
overcapacity, Britain's plans to leave the European Union and delays in the delivery of the Boeing 737 MAX.
In recent weeks it has been also been hit the threat of strike action by pilots in the United Kingdom and Ireland and 
cabin crew in Portugal.
Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorohan declined to comment on the likelihood of disruption in the coming weeks, but 
described the timing of ballots for industrial action as "a little bit unusual" given concerns around the MAX and 
Brexit and said the airline was open to talks.
The Dublin-based airline reported a profit after tax of 243 million euros for the three months to June 30, down 21% 
from 309 million a year earlier.
That was ahead of a forecast by a poll of analysts published by Ryanair ahead of the results of 232 million euros.
"The June quarter results were not quite as bad as feared," Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said in a note, adding that 
ticket revenue was slightly light compared with forecasts but revenue from optional extras was better than 
anticipated.
Ryanair reiterated its profit forecast for the year to March 31, 2020 of between 750 million euros and 950 million 
euros, compared to a forecast of 832 million euros in the analyst poll.
Ryanair profit slumps 21% as overcapacity drives fares down
"Current FY consensus is already in the bottom half of management’s guidance range, but there may be some 
slippage as higher estimates are reined in," Khoo said.
Ryanair said its fares in the three months to the end of June declined 6% from a year earlier and said it expected a 
similar fall for the remainder of the summer.
Average fares for the year to end-March 2020 will be towards the lower end of its guidance range of -2% to +1%.
Ryanair's shares closed on Friday at 10.02 euros, almost half their peak of 19.39 euros hit two years ago. (Reuters)

RYANAIR could have no Boeing 737 Max jets available next year unless the aircraft manufacturer "gets its sh*t 
together", said boss Michael O'Leary yesterday.
The airline wants the planemaker to update the jet so that authorities allow it to fly again. O'Leary is "concerned that 
the Max return to service keeps slipping".
The 737 Max was Boeing's fastest-selling plane, and has made billions of dollars in sales. Aviation authorities 
across the globe grounded the jet in March after two crashes which killed 346 people.
The planemaker hopes aviation regulators will give it the all-clear during the final three months of this year.
Meanwhile, Ryanair revealed yesterday profits fell 21 per cent in its latest quarter as the airline was battered by 
higher fuel and staff costs coupled with lower fares. The fuel bill for the quarter rose (EURO)150m (£137m), and 
staff costs grew 21 per cent.
In the UK, Ryanair said Brexit concerns "weigh negatively" on consumer spending.
Separately, former Boeing's 737 Max problems are starting to impact airlines Boeing engineer Adam Dickson, who 
worked on the 737 Max, told the BBC that work on the plane's production line was not properly funded, and that 
engineers faced pressure to keep costs down.
"Certainly what I saw was a lack of sufficient resources to do the job in its entirety," he said.

Ryanair warned of tough trading conditions in the European short-haul market yesterday as the Irish low-cost 
carrier reported a 24 per cent fall in pre-tax profit in the first quarter.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said some competitors were too optimistic going into winter and speculated that 
more airlines could go bust.
"There will be more failures this winter," he said, suggesting that Norwegian Air Shuttle's collapse is "a distinct 
possibility" come October or November. Damien Brewer, analyst at RBC, said "a poor summer profit reserve and 
winter costs will probably continue the industry shakeout".
Intense competition and softening demand plagues the European shorthaul market.
Brexit is a concern for Ryanair as it weighs on consumer spending. While Mr O'Leary said the airline was in "pretty 
good shape" to deal with Brexit, he cautioned that further negative effects "can't be ruled out" because of the lack of 
clarity over how Britain's negotiations with the EU will unfold.
The airline faced pressure in Germany, where Lufthansa's acquisition of Air Berlin has led to increased competition.
Ryanair said that its pre-tax profit for the three months to the end of June came in at (EURO)262.3m ($291.9m) 
versus (EURO)345.4m a year ago. Analysts had forecast a smaller fall of 16 per cent in pretax profit, according to 
Refinitiv. But despite a 6 per cent fall in average fares during the quarter, this was partly offset by a 14 per cent 
Ryanair set for harsh winter as quarterly earnings fall 24% Airlines
higher take in ancillary services, which includes baggage fees and on-board food. Total revenue during the period 
rose 11 per cent year on year to (EURO)2.31bn. Traffic rose 11 per cent to 42m passengers.
Ryanair maintained its profit after tax for the full financial year at (EURO)750m to (EURO)950m - broadly flat 
compared with its previous annual performance. The airline said pressure on ticket prices had carried on into the 
second quarter, which includes the summer period.
Ryanair announced earlier this month it would cut flights next summer and close some European bases as the 
prolonged grounding of Boeing's 737 Max jets would delay its orders.
While Mr O'Leary still expects to take 30 aircraft - of an original 58 - by next May, he warned this could be reduced, 
depending on when the Max jet is certified to fly. Mr Brewer added that the grounding by US carrier Southwest of 
the 737 Max into 2020 suggested that Ryanair's 2020/2021 growth plan "could yet be revised down further".

Ryanair warned of tough trading conditions in the European short-haul market yesterday as the Irish low-cost 
carrier reported a 24 per cent fall in pre-tax profit in the first quarter.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said some competitors were too optimistic going into winter and speculated that 
more airlines could go bust.
"There will be more failures this winter," he said, suggesting that Norwegian Air Shuttle's collapse is "a distinct 
possibility" come October or November. Damien Brewer, analyst at RBC, said "a poor summer profit reserve and 
winter costs will probably continue the industry shakeout".
Intense competition and softening demand plagues the European shorthaul market.
Brexit is a concern for Ryanair as it weighs on consumer spending. While Mr O'Leary said the airline was in "pretty 
good shape" to deal with Brexit, he cautioned that further negative effects "can't be ruled out" because of the lack of 
clarity over how Britain's negotiations with the EU will unfold.
The airline faced pressure in Germany, where Lufthansa's acquisition of Air Berlin has led to increased competition.
Ryanair said that its pre-tax profit for the three months to the end of June came in at (EURO)262.3m ($291.9m) 
versus (EURO)345.4m a year ago. Analysts had forecast a smaller fall of 16 per cent in pretax profit, according to

Jul 29, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair CEO 
Michael O'Leary is livid over Boeing's delays [1]to bring its 737 Max plane back to service after Boeing halted 
deliveries of the plane earlier this year."I am concerned that the Maxreturn to service is slipping," O'Leary said in a 
conference call Monday.O'Leary said Ryanair may not have planes ready by next summer unless Boeing "gets its 
s--- together."Boeing took 737 Max jets out of service in March after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia which 
happened within five months of each other and killed a total of 346 people. The crashes were possibly caused by a 
sensor issue[2] in the plane.The company has halted its deliveries of the plane, which has disrupted Ryanair's 
business plans. 
O'Leary hoped to have 58 Max 737 planes operating by next summer."It may well move to 20, it could move to 10, 
and it could move to zero if Boeing doesn't get it's sh--- together with the regulator," he said.[3] A delay could result 
in the growth rate to decrease to 5 million from 10 million passengers.Boeing is still in negotiations with safety 
regulators on when to proceed with its deliveries of the 737 Max. It's still unclear when regulators will allow the 
planes to fly again.The halt in deliveries has also affected other airlines, such as U.S.-based airline company 
American Airlines which said the grounding willcost the company $400 million in pretax earnings this 
year.Southwest Airlines, a low-cost U.S. airline, has warned travelers[4] that grounding of the 737 Max will result in 
travel disruptions during the holiday season this year.Ryanair is a popular low-cost airline based in Ireland. Ryanair 
planes operate on a tight schedule and charge for amenities such as food in order to keep ticket prices down and 
remain profitable. The company also requires expensive fees for baggage.O'Leary is one of Ireland's wealthiest

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has expressed concern about slips in the timeframe for the Boeing 737 
Max's expected return to service.
The budget carrier said on 16 July that it expected the Max to be back in service by December, but after reporting 
first-quarter results O'Leary today said that this now seemed like it would slip into January.
"We were expecting 58 aircraft for summer 2020; that's now 30 at best. It may well move to 20, could move to 10, 
or zero if Boeing don't get their shit together pretty quickly with the regulators," he told analysts.
O'Leary cited Southwest's decision to remove the aircraft from its schedules until January, and said the latest he 
had heard from Boeing was that they now planned to submit the software amendment in October, rather than 
September.
"It's very difficult to deal with the Boeing delays, because they keep getting delayed further and further. Up until mid-
July, we were expecting them to be back flying in September. Now it looks like January next year," he says.
Ryanair will not be taking delivery of any Max aircraft until the aircraft had been declared safe to fly by both US and 
European regulators, O'Leary says.
If deliveries slip further, that could cut Ryanair's planned passenger numbers for the full year to March 2021 from 
the revised 157 million to 155 million or even 153 million, he estimates.
Ryanair is in talks with Boeing over a new aircraft order for the period from 2023 onwards, O'Leary reveals, but he 
says those discussions are being hindered by the airframer's "inability" to get the Max back into service. Ryanair is 
also in talks with Airbus, which is pricing "very aggressively" at the moment, he notes.
Boeing needs to 'get its [act] together': Ryanair chief Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has expressed 
concern about slips in the timeframe for the Boein....
"Boeing is not at a point yet where we see value in a new aircraft order for the period from 2023 onwards," adds 
O'Leary.
He says Ryanair will be announcing base cuts and closures as a result of the Max delays over the next week or 
two.
It is impossible to sign up Airbus aircraft for next summer to replace the Max shortfall, he says, because there is no 
availability and it will hurt the pricing of second-hand A320s. The Lauda fleet of A320s is already planned to grow 
from 20 aircraft this summer to 32 for next summer.

       Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported that its first-quarter profit attributable to equity holders of parent 
fell 21% to 242.9 million euros from the prior year's 309.2 million euros due to lower fares, higher fuel and staff 
costs. Earnings per share were 0.2136 euros, down from 0.2637 euros in the prior year. 
 But, revenues rose 11% to 2.31 billion euros from last year. A 6% decline in average fare to 36 euros stimulated 
11% traffic growth to 42 million guests.
 Ryanair said, "The delivery of first 5 B737-MAX aircraft has been delayed from Q1 to probably January at the 
earliest. We now expect to receive only 30 MAX deliveries in time for S.20 (previously 58) which will cut Ryanair's 
S.20 growth rate from 7% to 3% (162m to approx. 157m guests in FY21)." 
 Ryanair said it continues to guide broadly flat fiscal year 2020 profit after tax in a range of 750 million euros to 950 
million euros. The current weak fare environment has continued into the second-quarter and it expects the first-half 
fares to be down about 6%.
 The company expects traffic to grow by 7% to over 152 million slightly less than the 153 million previously guided 
due to the Boeing MAX delivery delays.

British tourists travelling abroad this summer must navigate strike action at the UK's busiest airports and a slump in 
sterling as rising fears of a "no deal Brexit" in October put pressure on the pound.
As millions begin their summer getaway, strikes by airport workers and pilots threaten to cause disruption. Travel 
experts are urging airline customers to be aware of their rights to compensation.
Unite, the union, said up to 4,000 workers at London's Heathrow airport, including security guards and engineers, 
had called off industrial action planned for this weekend so its members could vote on a new pay offer. Without 
agreement, further strikes are planned for August 5, 6, 23 and 24.
Heathrow said it would implement contingency plans to ensure the airport remained open in the event of strikes and 
recommended passengers flying on these days contacted their airline in the days leading up to their flight to check 
its status.
At Gatwick airport, staff including baggage handlers and maintenance staff are voting on strike action this week, 
raising the potential of strikes from mid-August.
A planned strike by easyJet check-in staff at Stansted airport was suspended this week while Unite members voted 
on a new pay deal.
Strikes and weak sterling blight holiday season TRAVEL Travellers urged to know their rights in the event of 
delays
Thousands of passengers flying with British Airways this summer could be affected by strikes planned by pilots in a 
dispute over pay. This week, the UK's flagship carrier failed to obtain an injunction to prevent the strike and will now 
take its case to the Court of Appeal.
Balpa, the British Airline Pilots Association, confirmed it would not announce strike dates until after the appeal is 
heard, and is required to give two weeks' notice of industrial action, meaning that the earliest a strike could 
startwouldbeAugust 13.
The strike would affect flights to and from London Heathrow and Gatwick, but not BA's CityFlyer services 
fromLondonCity airport .
BA urged passengers to check its website for updates and ensure that contact details in the "Manage my booking" 
area of the sitewereuptodate.
Ryanair pilots are separately being balloted for strike action bythe Irish Airline Pilots Associationbut the outcome will 
notbeknownuntilAugust9.
Passengers whose TRAVEL plans are affected by strikedisruption have limited rights to compensation under EU 
rules governing flight delays, as these are seen as "extraordinarycircumstances".
Simon Calder of the BBC's The TRAVEL Show said European air passengers' rights rules stipulate compensation 
of (EURO)250 to (EURO)600 for flights that arrive three hours or morebehind schedule.
The payout applies for all flights from an EU airport and for departures from outside EuropeonanEUairline .
"Thecause 
of 
the 
delaymust 
be 
within 
the 
airline's 
control, 
rather 
than 
an 
'extraordinary 
circumstance'suchasweather, a security alert or staff shortages at air-traffic control - a particular problem this 
summer,"hesays.
"Some airlines will readily pay out for delays, but others will defend claims robustly."
"Whatever the cause of the delay, airlines must provide an alternative flight as soon as possible, on a rival carrier if 
need be, as well as meals and accommodation while the passenger is stranded."
Salman Haqqi, personal finance expert www.atMoney.co.uk, added that TRAVELlershadmore rights to 
compensation. if delays were due to an airline's ownstaff going on strike .
"This industrial action is the responsibility of the airline and 'extraordinary circumstance' cannot be cited as a 
reason,"he says.
"If airline staff strike and your flight to or fromtheUKis cancelled, under EU regulations, you are entitled to a full 
refund; or an alternative flight to your destination from a nearbyairport, with the airline responsible for additional 
costs; or a flight on a later date outside the strikeperiod.
"However, this will be scant consolation for many holidaymakers, as the likelihood of being able to book on to an 
alternative flight during this peakperiod willbeslim.
"Check your TRAVEL insurance, as you may be able to claim for a cancelled or delayed flight - provided you took 
the policy out before the strikes were announced," said MrHaqqi.
Passengers who do jet off would be well advised to avoid changing holidaymoneyat the airport .
During July, sterling has fallen by about 2 per cent against the dollar, but the pound reached parity against the 
dollar and the euro in most airport exchange booths some time ago, meaning TRAVELlers will receive less than 
(EURO)1 or $1 for every pound they exchange.
Strikes and weak sterling blight holiday season TRAVEL Travellers urged to know their rights in the event of 
delays
A study by FairFX, the holiday money specialist, found that exchange rates offered at UK airports were up to 21 per 
cent lower than the best market rate. Holidaymakers who leave changing money until the last minute could lose out 
by as much as (EURO)121 for every£500exchanged.
The Post Office warned that tourists using their bank cards abroad could be hit by unexpected charges costing the 
average family£120.UKbanks typically charge 3 per cent of the transaction value for overseas card transactions and 
ATMwithdrawals.
Digital challenger banks such as Starling, Monzo and Revolut waive these charges, and have rapid online account 
opening facilities for those about to Travel.
Certain credit cards also offer fee-free spending abroad - although if credit cards are used to withdraw cash froman 
ATM, interest will typically be charged fromthatday.
Finally, even TRAVELlers savvy enough to get a fee-free card should watch out for chip and pin terminals or 
cashpoints that ask if they want to pay in pounds rather than the local currency.
Known as "dynamic currency conversion", this allows the merchant to set the exchangerate.
"It's unlikely the rate they decide on will be in your favour," said Ian Strafford-Taylor, chief executive of FairFX.
A recent investigation by FairFX found that unsuspecting holidaymakers collectively paid out £490m in currency 
conversion fees.

Strikes and weak sterling blight holiday season; TRAVEL Travellers urged to

British tourists travelling abroad this summer must navigate strike action at the UK's busiest airports and a slump in 
sterling as rising fears of a "no deal Brexit" in October put pressure on the pound.
As millions begin their summer getaway, strikes by airport workers and pilots threaten to cause disruption. Travel 
experts are urging airline customers to be aware of their rights to compensation.
Unite, the union, said up to 4,000 workers at London's Heathrow airport, including security guards and engineers, 
had called off industrial action planned for this weekend so its members could vote on a new pay offer. Without 
agreement, further strikes are planned for August 5, 6, 23 and 24.
Heathrow said it would implement contingency plans to ensure the airport remained open in the event of strikes and 
recommended passengers flying on these days contacted their airline in the days leading up to their flight to check 
its status.
At Gatwick airport, staff including baggage handlers and maintenance staff are voting on strike action this week, 
raising the potential of strikes from mid-August.
A planned strike by easyJet check-in staff at Stansted airport was suspended this week while Unite members voted 
on a new pay deal.
Strikes and weak sterling blight holiday season TRAVEL Travellers urged to know their rights in the event of 
delays
Thousands of passengers flying with British Airways this summer could be affected by strikes planned by pilots in a 
dispute over pay. This week, the UK's flagship carrier failed to obtain an injunction to prevent the strike and will now 
take its case to the Court of Appeal.
Balpa, the British Airline Pilots Association, confirmed it would not announce strike dates until after the appeal is 
heard, and is required to give two weeks' notice of industrial action, meaning that the earliest a strike could 
startwouldbeAugust 13.
The strike would affect flights to and from London Heathrow and Gatwick, but not BA's CityFlyer services 
fromLondonCity airport .
BA urged passengers to check its website for updates and ensure that contact details in the "Manage my booking" 
area of the sitewereuptodate.
Ryanair pilots are separately being balloted for strike action bythe Irish Airline Pilots Associationbut the outcome will 
notbeknownuntilAugust9.
Passengers whose TRAVEL plans are affected by strikedisruption have limited rights to compensation under EU 
rules governing flight delays, as these are seen as "extraordinarycircumstances".
Simon Calder of the BBC's The TRAVEL Show said European air passengers' rights rules stipulate compensation 
of (EURO)250 to (EURO)600 for flights that arrive three hours or morebehind schedule.
The payout applies for all flights from an EU airport and for departures from outside EuropeonanEUairline .
"Thecause 
of 
the 
delaymust 
be 
within 
the 
airline's 
control, 
rather 
than 
an 
'extraordinary 
circumstance'suchasweather, a security alert or staff shortages at air-traffic control - a particular problem this 
summer,"hesays.
"Some airlines will readily pay out for delays, but others will defend claims robustly."
"Whatever the cause of the delay, airlines must provide an alternative flight as soon as possible, on a rival carrier if 
need be, as well as meals and accommodation while the passenger is stranded."
Salman Haqqi, personal finance expert www.atMoney.co.uk, added that TRAVELlershadmore rights to 
compensation. if delays were due to an airline's ownstaff going on strike .
"This industrial action is the responsibility of the airline and 'extraordinary circumstance' cannot be cited as a 
reason,"he says.
"If airline staff strike and your flight to or fromtheUKis cancelled, under EU regulations, you are entitled to a full 
refund; or an alternative flight to your destination from a nearbyairport, with the airline responsible for additional 
costs; or a flight on a later date outside the strikeperiod.
"However, this will be scant consolation for many holidaymakers, as the likelihood of being able to book on to an 
alternative flight during this peakperiod willbeslim.
"Check your TRAVEL insurance, as you may be able to claim for a cancelled or delayed flight - provided you took 
the policy out before the strikes were announced," said MrHaqqi.
Passengers who do jet off would be well advised to avoid changing holidaymoneyat the airport .
During July, sterling has fallen by about 2 per cent against the dollar, but the pound reached parity against the 
dollar and the euro in most airport exchange booths some time ago, meaning TRAVELlers will receive less than 
(EURO)1 or $1 for every pound they exchange.

delays
A study by FairFX, the holiday money specialist, found that exchange rates offered at UK airports were up to 21 per 
cent lower than the best market rate. Holidaymakers who leave changing money until the last minute could lose out 
by as much as (EURO)121 for every£500exchanged.
The Post Office warned that tourists using their bank cards abroad could be hit by unexpected charges costing the 
average family£120.UKbanks typically charge 3 per cent of the transaction value for overseas card transactions and 
ATMwithdrawals.

Ryanair Portuguese cabin crew to strike in August

Ryanair cabin crew in Portugal are set to strike for five days in August in a dispute over pay and conditions, the 
SNPVAC union said on Wednesday.
The industrial action comes as Ryanair pilots in Ireland and the United Kingdom are holding ballots on a possible 
strike action in August. SNPVAC said it had not yet decided which days in August it would strike.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, suffered a series of damaging strikes last year.
Management say significant progress has been made since, with collective labour agreements concluded with a 
number of pilot unions throughout Europe.
But SNPVAC said Ryanair has refused to comply with a protocol signed last November, which it said included 
holiday pay, 22 days of annual leave per year and full compliance with Portuguese parental law.
"Facing the intransigence from Ryanair and the lack of interest of the Portuguese government on guaranteeing the 
fundamental labour rights to their citizens that work for Ryanair, the cabin crew had no other choice but to return to 
the industrial conflict," SNPVAC said in a statement.
Ryanair did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reuters)

Operation “remains uncertain”, although it still believes this will happen before the end of the year.It points out, 
however, that the high-density version of the jet – the configuration ordered by Ryanair – will require separate 
certification and that this could take another two months after the Max is cleared.“Boeing is hoping that a 
certification package will be submitted to regulators by September with a return to service shortly thereafter,” says 
Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary.“We believe it would be prudent to plan for that date to slip by some 
months, possibly as late as December.”The delivery of 30 rather than 58 aircraft ahead of the summer season 
means the budget airline has revised its summer capacity expansion plan, cutting it back from 7% to 3%.“This 
shortfall in aircraft deliveries will necessitate some base cuts and closures for summer 2020, but also for the winter 
2019 schedule,” warns the carrier.

EasyJet has hired rival Ryanair's operations chief Peter Bellew, a 30-year industry veteran, as it navigates intense 
competition in the European short-haul market.
The airline announced Mr Bellew's appointment as chief operating officer alongside a trading update that revealed 
an 11 per cent rise in revenue for the latest quarter.
EasyJet said a strong Easter and a reduction in long delays and cancellations had helped boost total revenue to 
£1.76bn in the three months to June. Passenger revenue rose 10.7 per cent to £1.39bn.
The low-cost carrier said it that expected to deliver a profit before tax of between £400m and £440m in the second 
half, in line with market expectations.
Mr Bellew spent nine years at Ryanair, where he held roles including director of flight operations, before he left for 
Malaysia Airlines, where he was eventually named chief executive. He rejoined Ryanair in December 2017, 
following a pilot rostering crisis at the Irish carrier that led to the cancellation of 2,000 flights.
Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said Mr Bellow had an "exceptional level of experience" in low-cost 
and full-service airlines and was "a great leader with a proven track record in delivering results".
Mr Bellew said easyJet had a great product with an enviable position at many of Europe's primary airports. It had 
"always been an innovator".

Easyjet revenue takes off during 'robust' quarter
Easyjet revenue takes off during 'robust' quarter

EASYJET boosted revenue 11 per cent to £1.8bn in its third quarter, the airline revealed yesterday, saying it is on 
schedule to hit market expectations on profit.
The airline also posted higher passenger revenue, growing that 10.7 per cent year on year to record £1.4bn.
Ancillary revenue rose 14.3 per cent to £374m.
Meanwhile, the number of passengers rose by 2m to hit 26m for the quarter.
Chief executive Johan Lundgren hailed the solid quarter's trading and said the flyer should deliver profit before tax 
of between £400m and £440m.
However, "softening demand" due to macroeconomic uncertainty across Europe and Brexit-related consumer 
uncertainty hurt Easyjet.
It also pointed to headwinds from Monarch Airlines' and Air Berlin's bankruptcies, and France's so-called yellow 
vest protests, as challenges.
The firm expects to hit its full-year targets, including growing full-year capacity by 10 per cent, though second-half 
revenue will be slightly down, as per its earlier guidance.

 Budget airline easyJet PLC said on Thursday that third quarter revenue rose year-on-year, partly due to the Easter 
period being in the second half of the current financial year.
easyJet also announced it has poached the chief operating officer of market rival Ryanair Holdings PLC to take on 
the same role at easyJet. COO Peter Bellew had rejoined Ryanair in late 2017, having been chief executive officer 
of Malaysia Airlines. He previously had been had been director of flight operations for Ryanair until 2014. 
easyJet reported total revenue for the third quarter ended June 30 of GBP1.76 billion, an 11% year-on-year rise on 
2018's GBP1.51 billion. 
The airline said the later Easter in 2019, which generated almost GBP40.0 million extra, and an accounting change, 
which had a revenue benefit of GBP10.0 million, helped drive the third quarter growth. 
easyJet said ancillary revenue, which is the money it generates from baggage charges and on-board catering, grew 
by 14% year-on-year to GBP374.0 million from GBP328.0 million.
Passengers flown in the quarter rose to 26.4 million from 24.4 million a year before, with third-quarter revenue per 
seat also increased year-on-year to GBP61.22 from GBP60.44.
The company said the revenue gain was partially offset by weak market conditions, particularly in Europe due to 
Brexit-related consumer uncertainty. 
easyJet's cost per seat fell year-on-year, by 0.5% to GBP55.16 from GBP55.45. It attributed the reduction to fewer 
costly delays and the wet leasing of fewer aircraft. It also had fewer cancellations in the third quarter this year, 847 
compared with 2,606.
Looking ahead, the airline predicted pretax profit for the financial year ending September 30 to be between 
GBP400.0 million and GBP440.0 million, in line with market expectations. It would however be slightly below 
financial 2018's pretax profit of GBP445 million.
TOP NEWS: easyJet Poaches Ryanair Operating Chief Amid Revenue Rise
Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said: "easyJet's third quarter performance was robust and despite the tougher 
macroeconomic conditions was in line with expectations. Revenue increased by over 11% with revenue per seat 
increasing through a combination of successful revenue initiatives, a solid Easter performance and a focus on late 
yield initiatives, with passenger numbers climbing by two million to over 26 million. 
"Our customers experienced significantly reduced cancellations and long delays largely as a result of our 
investment in operational resilience, which also contributed significantly to driving down cost per seat ex fuel at 
constant currency by 4% in the period." 
easyJet shares were up 3.6% at 1,071.50 pence each in London on Thursday morning. Ryanair was trading flat at 
EUR10.50.

Ryanair 's British pilot union to vote on possible August strike
Ryanair's British pilot union to vote on possible August strike

Ryanair's British pilot union is to ballot members on possible strike action in coming weeks in a dispute over 
working conditions, the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) announced on Wednesday.
The results of the ballot are due on August 7 and strike action by pilots in the airline's largest market could take 
place two weeks later, the union told members in a memo, which has been seen by Reuters.
The ballot is a setback for management at Europe's largest low-cost carrier, who have in recent months said they 
had largely resolved an industrial relations dispute with pilots and cabin crew.
Ryanair suffered a series of damaging strikes last year after the carrier bowed to pressure in late 2017 to recognize 
unions for the first time. But since then it has signed collective labor agreements with a number of pilot unions 
throughout Europe.
BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said in a statement that no progress had been made in talks on issues 
including pensions, maternity benefits and "a fair, transparent, and consistent pay structure."
"We have not been able to make any progress with Ryanair at all on any of our areas of concern," Strutton said.
In the memo, BALPA said its members in a consultative ballot had overwhelmingly supported the move to hold a 
vote on strike action.
It said it understood that pilot union colleagues in Spain, Ireland, Sweden and Germany had made "little, if any, 
meaningful progress" in talks with Ryanair.
Ryanair 's British pilot union to vote on possible August strike
Ryanair, which says it offers some of the best conditions for low-cost short-haul Boeing pilots in Europe, did not 
immediately respond to a request for comment.
Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs earlier on Wednesday said he hoped to sign collective labor agreements with 
Germany's Vereinigung Cockpit pilot union by the end of August, adding that he did not expect strikes anywhere in 
Europe.
On Tuesday, Ryanair said it had been forced to halve its growth plans for 2020 due to delays in the delivery of 
Boeing's grounded 737 MAX jet and planned to start talks with airports and unions about downsizing or closing 
some operations from November 2019. (Reuters)

       Low-cost airline easyJet Plc (ESYJY.PK, EZJ.L) reported Thursday that its third-quarter total revenue 
increased 11.4 percent from the year-ago period to 1.76 billion pounds.
 Passenger revenue for the quarter increased by 10.7 percent to 1.39 billion pounds and ancillary revenue 
increased by 14.3 percent to 374 million pounds.
 Passenger numbers in the third quarter increased 8 percent to 26.4 million, driven by an increase in capacity of 10 
percent to 28.8 million seats. 
 Load factor decreased, as anticipated, by 1.7 percentage points to 91.7 percent, due to late yield initiatives as well 
as high prior-year comparatives due to industrial action in France and Monarch's bankruptcy.
 Total revenue per seat increased 0.7 percent at constant currency, including a strong late yield performance which 
benefited from easyJet's revenue initiatives as well as positive ancillary revenue growth and a solid Easter 
performance.
 Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, easyJet forecast its headline profit before tax to be between 400 million pounds and 
440 million pounds, in line with market expectations. The company also affirmed its outlook for full-year capacity to 
grow by about 10 percent.
 Further, easyJet maintained its outlook for second-half revenue per seat at constant currency to be slightly down, 
and capacity to grow by about 7 percent.
 easyJet also said that Peter Bellew will join the company as Chief Operating Officer.  He will be a member of the 
Airline Management Board and will report to easyJet's CEO, Johan Lundgren.

UK low-cost carrier EasyJet has appointed former Ryanair executive Peter Bellew as its new chief operating officer, 
it disclosed today as it reported "robust" third-quarter trading.
EasyJet chief Johan Lundgren says Bellew's experience at both low-cost and full-service carriers – he served a 
stint as Malaysia Airlines' chief executive – meant he would be a "great addition" to the team.
Bellew is leaving Ryanair at the end of the year, but it is not yet confirmed when he would take up his new role at 
EasyJet, says Lundgren.
In a trading update, EasyJet says total revenue for the three months to 30 June rose 11% to £1.76 billion ($2.16 
billion), while revenue per seat rose 0.7% at constant currency.
The airline highlights that it brought cost per seat excluding fuel down by 4% at constant currency in the quarter.
"Our customers experienced significantly less disruption aided by our investments in resilience, with two-thirds less 
cancellations in the period helping to drive costs down," notes Lundgren.
EasyJet also says it is benefiting from more capacity discipline in the market, with rivals growing capacity 3.4% 
across its network. That compares with EasyJet's full-year capacity growth of 10%, unchanged from its last update.
"Make no mistake, it is still tough out there," says Lundgren. EasyJet expects second-half headline revenue per 
seat will be slightly down. .

However, Lundgren says he is pleased with the late-booking environment and adds that EasyJet has taken 
measures to improve late yields, such as getting more detailed information on pricing on a route-by-route basis via 
better data analysis and algorithms.
It says it expects to deliver a full-year profit before tax of £400-440 million, which it describes as in line with market 
expectations. For the 2018/19 financial year, it made a profit of £578 million.
For the current financial year it expects a total fuel bill of £1.4 billion and foresees that foreign-exchange 
movements will have a £5 million adverse impact on headline pretax profit.

Ryanair cuts flights and weighs closing bases after Boeing 737 Max grounding
Ryanair cuts flights and weighs closing bases after Boeing 737 Max

Low-cost airline Ryanair will cut flights next summer and potentially close some European bases as the result of the 
grounding of the Boeing 737 Max jets after two fatal crashes.
The Irish carrier said the delay to the delivery of new aircraft meant it would receive almost half the number of jets - 
30 compared with 58 - that it was expecting by next May.
The shortfall has led the airline to cut the number of passengers it expects to carry in the year to March 2021 to 
157m, from the 162m previously forecast.
Ryanair said that it would also need to make some cutbacks, including the possible closure of some of its bases for 
summer 2020. Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the group was starting a series of discussions with its airports 
to determine which of its underperforming or lossmaking bases would take a hit from November this year.
Ryanair said it expected the 737 Max 8, which has been grounded after two crashes in which 346 people died, to 
return to service before the end of this year, although that could be delayed. Boeing hopes to lodge an application 
to regulators to allow the aircraft to fly again by September, with a return to service shortly after. However, Mr 
O'Leary said "it would be prudent to plan for that date to slip by some months, possibly as late as December".
Ryanair cuts flights and weighs closing bases after Boeing 737 Max grounding
Ryanair has ordered 737 Max 200s, a variant of the 737 Max 8 aircraft. With additional seats and an extra 
emergency door, these jets need to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration in the US and the European 
Aviation Safety Agency.
The airline expected approval for the 737 Max 200s within two months of the Max 737's return to service and hoped 
to receive its first Max 200 aircraft between January and February 2020.
Ryanair can take delivery of only between six and eight new aircraft each month and said that it was therefore 
planning its summer 2020 schedules based on taking 30 deliveries.
Bernstein analysts said the easing of capacity growth was actually a positive for the broader industry.

Ryanair has ordered 737 Max 200s, a variant of the 737 Max 8 aircraft. With additional seats and an extra 
emergency door, these jets need to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration in the US and the European 
Aviation Safety Agency.
The airline had expected approval for the 737 Max 200s within two months of the Max 737's return to service and 
hoped to receive its first Max 200 between January and February 2020.
Ryanair can only take delivery of between six and eight new aircraft each month and said it was therefore planning 
its summer 2020 schedules based on taking 30 deliveries. Mr O'Leary said that number "could rise, or fall further, 
depending on when the 737 Max actually returns to flight services".
Analysts at Bernstein said the easing of capacity growth was actually a positive for the broader industry and "more 
supportive for European short-haul yields". They said competitors could respond by "electing to ramp up their own 
flying and grab share, or curbing their own capacity growth in an effort to further support yields".
While Ryanair said its cuts to bases or possible closures were linked to the grounding of the 737 Max, Gerald Khoo, 
an analyst at Liberum, said the move "may be interpreted as an indicator of underlying weakness in trading".
Ryanair's share price closed 2.5 per cent up yesterday. Shares in its rivals, including easyJet, Lufthansa and British 
Airways' parent IAG, also rose.
Norwegian Air Shuttle is another European low-cost carrier affected by the grounding of its 737 Max 8 jets. It 
operated 18 Max 8 aircraft out of a total fleet of about 160 planes.
The delay to deliveries means the carrier will receive almost half the number of jets it expected

RYANAIR yesterday warned it had been forced to reschedule its summer 2020 plans due to a delay in the delivery 
of Boeing 737 Max planes.
The budget flyer had ordered 58 Max 200 models from Boeing in time for summer 2020, but now expects just 30 to 
be ready by then.
That will more than halve Ryanair's growth rate next summer, from an expected seven per cent to just three per 
cent. Passenger numbers will also fall from 162m to 157m for the year to March 2021.
As a result, Ryanair warned it will have to make "some base cuts and closures", not only for summer 2020 but also 
for winter this year.
"We are starting a series of discussions with our airports to determine which of Ryanair's underperforming or loss-
making bases should suffer these short-term cuts and/or closures from November 2019," boss Michael O'Leary 
warned.
The 737 Max 200s Ryanair has ordered are a variant of the 737 Max aircraft the US banned from skies following 
two fatal crashes linked to issues with the model's anti-stall software. These models may not return to service until 
December.
www.Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said: "It's not all bad - stripping out excess capacity should boost pricing 
power and lift margins."

LONDON's main index rose yesterday as Burberry scaled an 11-month high after its firstquarter update showed 
new designs boosted sales, and a weaker sterling aided exporter stocks.
The FTSE 100 added 0.6 per cent to 7,77.20 points, its best day in nearly two weeks, outperforming the broader 
European markets.
Gains in Easyjet and Aston Martin helped the FTSE 250 advance 0.4 per cent to 19,656.05 [points, despite a hit to 
the local currency from mounting Brexit jitters.
Luxury brand Burberry jumped more than 15 per cent on its best day ever, after it posted a stronger-than-expected 
rise in first-quarter comparable-store sales and affirmed its annual forecast.
Airline stocks climbed after Ryanair said deliveries of Boeing's 737 Max planes may be delayed further, raising the 
prospects of easing over-capacity in the European market.
Shares in Ryanair, which cut its forecast for growth in traveller numbers next summer, and British Airways owner 
IAG gained 2.6 per cent each.

Boeing jet trouble leads to cuts at Europe's busiest airline

LONDON (AP) - Europe's biggest airline, budget carrier Ryanair, will cut flights and close some of its bases 
beginning this winter because of the delay to deliveries of the Boeing 737 Max plane, which has been grounded 
globally after two fatal crashes.
The airline also warned Tuesday that its growth in European summer traffic for 2020 will be lower than expected 
because of the slowed deliveries.
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary said the airline "remains committed" to the Boeing 737 Max and expects it to be back 
in service before the end of the year but that the date is uncertain.
Ryanair, which is Europe's top airline by passengers, says some delays are expected and doubts about when the 
plane can return to the skies means it will take delivery of only 30 Max jets a year from now, rather than the 
previously scheduled 58.
He says the airline will close some of its bases as a result with a hope to return to "normal" growth levels in 2021. 
No details about the planned base cuts were provided.
Analysts at market research firm FXPro note that while Europe's economy is slowing, there is no lack of demand for 
flying, so Ryanair's decision could cause flight tickets to rise somewhat.
Boeing's 737 Max has been grounded after the Lion Air crash off the coast of Indonesia in October and the 
Ethiopian Airlines crash in March that killed a total of 346 people.
Preliminary reports indicate that flight-control software called MCAS pushed the nose of the plane down in both 
crashes. Chicago-based Boeing did not tell pilots about MCAS until after the first crash. The company is working on 
changes to make the software more reliable and easier to control.
Concerns about viability of the new aircraft remains, however.
Boeing jet trouble leads to cuts at Europe's busiest airline
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is due to review Boeing's fixes and has said it is following a thorough 
process, but has no timetable for when the recertification will be completed. European regulators have to then also 
approve the jets before they can be used in the region.
American Airlines said this week that it will keep the Boeing 737 Max plane off its schedule until Nov. 3, which is 
two months longer than it had planned. That will result in the cancellation of about 115 flights per day.
United Airlines has also extended its cancellations until Nov. 3. The company has 14 Max jets while American has 
24 of them. Southwest Airlines, which has 34 Max jets - more than any other carrier - is canceling about 150 flights 
per day.

unfolding earnings season. Upside sentiment was capped by the China-US trade dispute, as well as the Tokyo-
Seoul trade dispute over WWII reparations, said analysts. Hong Kong gained ground, although Shanghai edged 
lower and Tokyo lost ground on a stronger yen. Other regional exchanges mostly finished in the green.
In Japan, the Nikkei 225 opened lower after a three-day weekend and declined in trading, finishing down 0.69% as

Ryanair Cuts Summer 2020 Growth Rate More Than Half, Now Expects 737 MAX Flight Services in December

 Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L), Europe's largest budget airline, said early Tuesday that its summer 2020 growth rate 
would be cut by more than half and winter 2019 schedules won't remain unaffected because of the delay in Boeing 
(BA) 737 MAX aircraft deliveries, which may not return to skies until December. 
The group said in a statement early on Tuesday that it was now planning the summer 2020 schedules with just over 
half the original number of 737s penciled in for delivery next year. 
The 737 was involved in two crashes earlier this year, in Indonesia and Ethiopia, in which hundreds of people were 
killed. Boeing, which identified a software failure as a common contributory factor to both the fatal accidents, 
recently announced a $100 million program to support the families of the victims. 
"Boeing is hoping that a certification package will be submitted to regulators by September with a return to service 
shortly thereafter," the European carrier said in a statement. "It would be prudent to plan for that date to slip by 
some months, possibly as late as December."
As Ryanair has ordered the Boeing MAX200s, which are a variant of the MAX aircraft, these need to be separately 
certified by aviation authorities. Ryanair expects that the MAX200 will be approved for flight services within two 
months of the MAX returning to service.
Accordingly, Ryanair now hopes to receive its first MAX200 aircraft sometime between January and February. 
Since Ryanair can only take delivery of between six to eight new aircraft each month, it is planning the summer 
2020 schedules based on taking up to 30 B737 MAX aircraft deliveries up to end of May 2020. This is fewer than 
the 58 MAX aircraft Boeing originally scheduled for the summer of next year.
"This will cut Ryanair's summer 2020 growth rate from 7% to 3% and means full-year traffic growth for the year to 
March 2021 will be cut from 162 million guests to approximately 157 million," the company said in a statement.

"This shortfall in aircraft deliveries will necessitate some base cuts and closures for Summer 2020, but also for the 
Winter 2019 schedule," the company said.

 Ryanair Holdings on Tuesday said it expects Boeing 737 MAX aircraft delivery delays to slow its capacity growth. 
The stock was down 0.9% at the London open.
Ryanair said it remains committed to the B737 MAX aircraft. It expects the troubled jet - grounded globally by 
regulators after two fatal crashes - to return to flying service before the end of 2019, but the exact date of this return 
remains uncertain.
The Irish budget airline is to revise its summer 2020 schedule due to the 737 delivery delays.
As a result, Ryanair said it expects summer 2020 traffic growth rate to slow to 3% from 7%, which means traffic 
growth for its full financial year to March 2021 will be cut to around 157 million passenger from 162 million.
"This shortfall in aircraft deliveries will necessitate some base cuts and closures for summer 2020, but also for the 
winter 2019 schedule. We are starting a series of discussions with our airports to determine which of Ryanair's 
underperforming or loss making bases should suffer these short term cuts and/or closures from November 2019. 
We will also be consulting with our people and our unions in planning and implementing these base cuts and 
closures, which are directly caused by the B737 MAX delivery delays to the B737 MAX program," said Chief 
Executive Officer Michael O'Leary.

 Stock prices in London are seen opening marginally lower on Tuesday, amid mixed trading in Asian equity 
markets, as investors look to a busy day on the US earnings front. 
In early company news, Irish airline Ryanair said it would scale back some of its services amid delays to deliveries 
of the grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, while fashion retailer Burberry and credit checking firm Experian said 
they made positive starts to their respective financial years.
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 4.72 points lower at 7,527.00. The blue chip index closed 25.75 
points higher, or 0.3%, at 7,531.72 on Monday. 
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.7%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is down 0.3%, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.2%. Financial markets in Japan reopened Tuesday after being closed on 
Monday for a public holiday. 
Budget carrier Ryanair Holdings said it expects Boeing 737 MAX aircraft delivery delays to slow capacity growth.
Ryanair said it remains committed to the B737 MAX aircraft. It expects the jet - grounded globally by regulators after

We will also be consulting with our people and our unions in planning and implementing these base cuts and 
closures, which are directly caused by the B737 MAX delivery delays to the B737 MAX program," said Chief 
Executive Officer Michael O'Leary.
Burberry Group said it saw a good start to its financial year as Chief Creative Officer Riccardo Tisci continues to 
make his mark on the fashion house. 
The company said it saw an excellent consumer response to Tisci's work with new collections delivering strong 
double-digit percentage growth compared to last year's collections, in line with expectations. 
For the 13 weeks to June 29, the company reported retail revenue of GBP498 million, up 4% from GBP479 million 
in the first quarter last year. Comparable store sales were up 4%, with growth led by new products. In the Europe, 
the Middle East and Africa region comparable store sales grew by a low-single digit percentage, supported by 
tourist spending, which particularly benefited the UK. 
In the key Asia Pacific region, comparable store sales grew by a high single-digit percentage driven by Mainland 
China, up by the mid-teens. The Americas unit was flat, with the US growing by a low-single digit percentage but 
Canada was hurt by a later markdown period.
Burberry maintained its financial 2020 guidance for broadly stable revenue and adjusted operating margin at 
constant exchange rates including cumulative cost savings of GBP120 million. 
Experian said it started its financial year well and in line with expectations and left its guidance unchanged. 
For the three months to June 30, the company reported total revenue growth of 7% at constant exchange rates and 
organic revenue growth of 6%. At actual exchange rates total growth was 4%. 
In the North America region, organic revenue increased by 8%. Total revenue growth was 9%, which the company 
said reflected the contribution from its recent acquisition of AllClear ID.
In the UK and Ireland, total and organic revenue growth were both flat at constant currency. At constant currency, 
total revenue growth across EMEA/Asia Pacific region was 6%, while organic revenue declined by 1%.
Rio Tinto reported a drop in first half iron ore production at the company's Pilbara operations in Western Australia 
due to operational and weather-related issues.
In the six months to June 30, Rio Tinto's Pilbara iron ore production, on a 100% basis, slipped 8% year-on-year to 
155.7 million tonnes. Iron shipments also decreased 8% to 154.6 million tonnes.
Pilbara iron production in the second quarter was down 7% to 79.7 million tonnes. Iron ore shipments in the three 
month period was 3% lower at 85.4 million tonnes.
Rio Tinto blamed the fall in shipments due to recovery works following Tropical Cyclone Veronica and a fire at Cape 
Lambert. The miner said all repairs are now complete.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2513 early Tuesday, flat against USD1.2518 at the London equities close Monday. 
The economic calendar on Tuesday has UK claimant count and average earnings at 0930 BST, eurozone trade 
balance at 1000 BST and US retail sales and US import and export price indexes at 1330 BST. The US Johnson 
Redbook Retail Sales Index follows at 1355 BST. 
Top US and Chinese trade negotiators are due to speak by telephone in the coming days, but no face-to-face talks 
have been scheduled yet, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday.
That would be the second call in two weeks by senior officials from Washington and Beijing as the thaw in fraught 
trade negotiations continues.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Ryanair Cuts Traffic Growth Rate On Boeing 737
"We expect to have another principal-level call this week," Mnuchin told reporters on Monday. "To the extent we 
make significant progress, there's a good chance we'll go there later."
President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart last month agreed to resume trade talks after discussions 
collapsed in early May when the American side accused Beijing of reneging on key commitments.
As a result, Trump raised duty rates on USD200 billion in Chinese imports but agreed last month not to move 
forward with another USD300 billion in import duties.
In the US earnings calendar on Tuesday, banks JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo will report 
earnings on Tuesday before the New York opening bell. Consumer products firm Johnson & Johnson also will issue

Europe's largest budget carrier Ryanair has cut its forecast for growth in traveler numbers next summer due to the 
possibility of further delays in deliveries of Boeing 737 MAX planes.
Ryanair cut its summer 2020 growth rate to 3% from 7%, which means full year traffic growth for the year to March

The airline expects the grounded aircraft to return to service before the end of the year, with the first of new aircraft

But the exact date is uncertain and Ryanair has revised its summer 2020 schedule based on 30 incremental

maximum rate of 6 to 8 per month.

The worldwide grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX has resulted in Irish low-cost airline Ryanair being forced to 
reduce the number of summer flights it operates next year.
According to BBC.com, Ryanair officials are making the adjustments after it was reported the 737 MAX could be out 
of commission through the end of 2019 as aviation authorities work to clear the planes for service once again.
Ryanair is still awaiting the delivery of 58 of the impacted 737 MAX aircraft before next summer, but the carrier now 
only expects to receive about half of that order. In addition, the reduced scheduled could result in base closures and 
job cuts at airports.

Ryanair will not be marketing the Boeing 737 Max differently to the other aircraft in its fleet, its chief executive 
confirmed today.
During a call with analysts after announcing slower growth plans for 2020 as a result of the Max grounding, Michael 
O'Leary repeatedly referred to the aircraft as the "Max".
"We will not be separately designating the Max aircraft from the NGs," he says. "It's impossible because we do our 
aircraft allocations overnight, so we have no idea tomorrow or next month which flight will be operated by an NG or 
a 737 Max."
He does not expect there to be a customer perception issue or lack of confidence in the aircraft once it is back 
flying. He cites the example of the 787, which was grounded for a short while over lithium-battery issues.
"Once the return to service is successfully managed, I think the Ryanair aircraft will be warmly welcomed by our 
passengers who fly on them, in much the same way that the passengers love flying the 787 and it has become an 
incredibly popular aircraft," O'Leary predicts.
In terms of pilot training, he says the expectation at the moment is that pilots will require additional computer-based 
training, with simulator time to come as part of the regular six-monthly simulator checks, although he adds that this 
could still change.
Referring to a picture circulating on social media which purportedly shows a Ryanair Max aircraft with the Max 
name no longer on the nose, O'Leary says the airline doesn't put names on its aircraft, just a registration number 
and "a big Ryanair".
E No plans to market 737 Max differently: Ryanair chief Ryanair will not be marketing the Boeing 737 Max

The airline's announcement of planned cuts to its schedule for winter 2019 and 2020 boosted shares in rivals today, 
as analysts highlighted that the lower capacity could relieve pressure on yields in the European short-haul market.
Shares in Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, Norwegian and EasyJet all gained by 3-4%.
"With the European short-haul market plagued by overcapacities this year, a slowing of Ryanair's growth for next 
summer may provide some welcome respite in a year that, based on delivery schedules, could have been even 
worse," Bernstein analysts wrote in reaction. They add that it will be interesting to see how rivals react, whether by 
increasing capacity to grab market share or curbing growth to support yields.
O'Leary declined to comment on the impact on fares and yields today, saying he would provide more colour at 
Ryanair's first-quarter results briefing on 29 July.
The carrier is slowing its plans to sell 10 older 737s to GECAS and return around 16 that are currently being leased 
between now and summer 2020.
O'Leary says it is likely Ryanair will not return all of the 16 leased aircraft or deliver all 10 aircraft to GECAS and will 
instead keep some for the summer 2020 flying season. He adds that even if Ryanair keeps some of these aircraft 
for longer, it won't massively change the new growth plans announced today.
He also highlights that keeping the older aircraft will have some "cost ramifications" in terms of heavy maintenance 
and lease commitments.
"We are in discussions with Boeing and would be expecting them to contribute to any consequential costs that 
arise," he says.
While he acknowledges that it is "disappointing" that deliveries have been delayed and that Ryanair has had to cut 
its growth plans as a result, he stresses that Ryanair remains confident in the aircraft, which he sees as a "great 
product".
"If Boeing could deliver us 58 aircraft between now and the end of May, we would take all 58," he says, citing the 
"phenomenal" operating costs.
"We have always described these aircraft as game changers and they will remain game changers," he adds.

       Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) Tuesday said it expects Boeing 737 MAX delivery delays to 
slow capacity growth for winter 2019 and summer 2020.
 In its update to investors on the current uncertainty over the 737 MAX deliveries, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary 
said the exact date of the aircraft's return remains uncertain. Despite this, the company remains committed to the 
B737 MAX aircraft, and now expects that it will return to flying service before the end of 2019.
 According to the company, Boeing is likely to submit a certification package to regulators by September with a 
return to service shortly thereafter.
 Ryanair expects that the MAX200 will be approved for flight services within 2 months of the MAX return to service.
 The company said it expects to receive its first MAX200 aircraft sometime between January and February 2020. 
Ryanair noted that it can only take delivery of between 6 to 8 new aircraft each month.
 Due to this, the company is planning summer 2020 schedules based on taking up to 30 B737 MAX aircraft 
deliveries up to end of May 2020, down from the 58 MAX aircraft Boeing originally scheduled to deliver.
 Ryanair expects a cut in summer 2020 growth rate to 3 percent from 7 percent. The company expects full year 
traffic growth for the year to March 2021 will be cut to approximately 157 million guests from 162 million guests.
 The company said it is initiating talks with its airports to find out underperforming or loss making bases that should 
suffer these short term cuts and/or closures from November 2019.

Ryanair is warning of base cuts and closures because it expects to have only half the number of Boeing 737 Max 
jets in service for summer 2020 than it originally expected.
The airline says it had expected 58 737 Max jets to be delivered for its summer 2020 schedule, but will not be able 
to take the first until around January-February next year – and will only be able to introduce six to eight each month.
Ryanair
Ryanair says that, as a result, it is planning to receive only 30 of the aircraft to the end of May.
"This number could rise, or fall further, depending on when the 737 Max actually returns to flight services," it adds.
Ryanair says the precise date for the Max's return to service "remains uncertain" although it still believes this will 
happen before the end of the year.
It points out, however, that the high-density version of the jet – the configuration ordered by Ryanair – will require 
separate certification and that this could take another two months after the Max returns to service.
"Boeing is hoping that a certification package will be submitted to regulators by September with a return to service 
shortly thereafter," says Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary.
"We believe it would be prudent to plan for that date to slip by some months, possibly as late as December."
The delivery of 30 rather than 58 aircraft ahead of the summer season means the budget airline has revised its 
summer capacity expansion plan, cutting it back from 7% to 3%.
Ryanair warns of base cuts over 737 Max delays E Ryanair is warning of base cuts and closures because it 
expects to have only half the number of Boeing 737 Max ....
As a result the carrier will transport 5 million fewer passengers, a total of 157 million, over the financial year 2020-
21.
"This shortfall in aircraft deliveries will necessitate some base cuts and closures for summer 2020, but also for the 
winter 2019 schedule," warns the carrier.
"We are starting a series of discussions with our airports to determine which of Ryanair's underperforming or loss-
making bases should suffer these short-term cuts [or] closures from November 2019."
The airline says it will work to restore it growth levels in summer 2021.
Ryanair is still referring to the type as the 737 Max despite photographs emerging on social media indicating that at 
least one of its new jets has had the 'Max' name removed, and replaced with the formal '737-8200' designator for 
the high-density variant.

Highlight: Ireland-based budget airline Ryanair is reportedly planning to rebrand its Boeing 737 Max jets following 
two fatal crashes.
Body
The rebranding is expected to be implemented once the aircraft gets approval to fly again. Ryanair has a fleet of 
420 Boeing jets and has not yet operated the newly ordered aircraft, which has been grounded worldwide following 
two fatal crashes. 
Photos have emerged of a Boeing 737 Max in Ryanair branding outside the Boeing manufacturing hub with the 
name 737-8200 in place of 737 Max on the tip of its nose. The 737-8200 is a type name for the aircraft that is used 
by regulatory bodies in the aviation industry. In addition to Ryanair, International Airlines Group (IAG) also 
announced a letter of intent signed at the Paris Airshow, referring the aircraft as 200 B737 aircraft. IAG said that the 
new aircraft, described as a mix of 737-8 and 737-10 aircraft, will join its fleet from 2023. Ryanair did not respond to 
a request on the rebranding of its 737 Max jets, reported Business Insider. The news agency also said that Boeing 
declined to comment on the apparent rebranding. Recently, American Airlines announced an extension of 
cancellations for the 737 Max aircraft until early November. It is reported that BoeingÂ 737Â Max jets are unlikely to 
be approved for operation before 2020. Last month, US regulators found a potential risk in Boeing's 737 Max 
aircraft during simulator trials, which is likely to delay test flights. Earlier last month, the company announced that 
some of its 737 jets, including many 737 Max aircraft, may have faulty parts on their wings.

Highlight: The pound slides, despite strong employment figures, boosting multinationals on the FTSE 100 with 
Burberry shares jumping on strong first-quarter fashion sales, though Irn-Bru maker AG Barr dives after a profit 
warning.
Body
Luxury fashion brand Burberry (BRBY) buoyed the FTSE 100 after its shares jumped on a strong first-quarter 
results, while Irn-Bru maker AG Barr (BAG) dived following a profit warning.
The FTSE 100 climbed 14 points, or 0.2%, to 7,546, with Burberry advancing 12% to £22.29 after posting a 4% rise 
in sales in the first quarter.
The blue-chip index was boosted by a sharp drop in the pound despite the release of good UK labour market data. 
The figures again showed low unemployment of 3.8% and wages growing at 3.6% a year, their fastest rate since 
2008.
Sterling tumbled to a two-month low of 90.27p against the euro and fell 0.6% to $1.2435 to skirt two-year lows 
against the dollar. This followed more hawkish comments from Tory leadership candidates Boris Johnson and 
Jeremy Hunt who yesterday both dismissed the Irish backstop arrangement, thus making a hard Brexit more likely 
after October.
Burberry sales were propelled by a new collection from creative chief Riccardo Tisci, as well as growth in China and 
Europe.
‘The CEO reported they remain on track with their plans to transform the group and guidance for the full year 2020 
has been maintained,’ said Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at The Share Centre. 
‘The business review, in rather flowery language, stated that Burberry has been working hard to re-energise the 
brand. Investors who have experienced a rather bumpy ride over the last couple of years will be encouraged by the 
update and the progress the group is making. We maintain our hold recommendation.’
The mid-cap FTSE 250 index slipped 12 points to 19,571, weighed down by AG Barr shares losing a quarter of their 
value, with a 216p slump to 647p. The soft drink-maker said trading year-to-date had been below expectations and 
forecasted full-year profits would fall 20% this year.
Burberry buoys FTSE, AG Barr loses fizz on alert
AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould believed the company, a long-standing holding of fund manager Nick Train, 
would recover.‘It is generally good at keeping up with changing consumer tastes, as illustrated by plans to launch 
an Irn-Bru energy drink this summer and the recent debut of its Funkin canned cocktails. It has also made an 
investment in alcohol-free adults drinks firm Elegantly Spirited,’ he said.
‘The ability to manage constant moving parts and have fairly resilient earnings shows that management are good at 
their job. One also has to think that the current sunny weather plays to AG Barr’s favour and so it may not be in a 
sticky patch for too long.’
Ryanair (RYA) lifted the airline sector, its shares 1.2% firmer at €10.21 (921p) after the budget operator warned of 
delays to deliveries of Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft, which would ease over-capacity in Europe.
‘It’s not all bad - stripping out a load of excess capacity should boost pricing power and lift margins for others, as 
well as for Ryanair,’ said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com.
Rivals International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) and Easyjet (EZJ) climbed on the news, up 2% to 464p and 
3.3% to £10.29 respectively.

While several media reports are claiming that Ryanair has rebranded the Boeing 737 Max, in the aftermath of the 
re-engined type's grounding, the chosen '737-8200' designation is not new.
Photographs circulating on social media purport to show a Ryanair 737 Max 8 – registered EI-HAY and parked at 
Boeing's Renton facility – with the 'Max' name no longer on the nose.
The aircraft instead carries the identity '737-8200'.
But this name, contrary to a number of reports in the media, is not a new designation for the aircraft, and actually 
predates both the Max grounding and the two fatal accidents which led to the type's suspension from operations.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency had been referring to the 737-8200 in documents such as its 2015 
annual activity report, published in June 2016, almost a year before the first ever 737 Max delivery.
This designation has frequently been included in US federal regulatory filings from Boeing and the US FAA since at 
least early 2017.
EASA documents on seating capacity and exit configurations for the aircraft – which will have a high-density layout 
compared with the regular Max 8 – also specifically referred to the variant as the 737-8200 when they were 
published for comment last year.
EASA
Ryanair is intending to take its version of the aircraft, which was also previously known as the 'Max 200', with a 197-
seat layout.

has shown interest in converting to the type.

While several media reports are claiming that Ryanair has rebranded the Boeing 737 Max, in the aftermath of the 
re-engined type's grounding, the chosen '737-8200' designation is not new.
Photographs circulating on social media purport to show a Ryanair 737 Max 8 – registered EI-HAY and parked at 
Boeing's Renton facility – with the 'Max' name no longer on the nose, possibly a response to perceptions that the 
'Max' brand is tainted by poor publicity after the fleet was grounded five months ago.
The aircraft instead carries the identity '737-8200'.
Although the switch is notable, the name – contrary to a number of reports – is not a new designation for the 
aircraft, and actually predates both the Max grounding and the two fatal accidents which led to the type's 
suspension from operations.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency had been referring to the 737-8200 in documents such as its 2015 
annual activity report, published in June 2016, almost a year before the first ever 737 Max delivery.
This designation has frequently been included in US federal regulatory filings from Boeing and the US FAA since at 
least early 2017.
EASA documents on seating capacity and exit configurations for the aircraft – which will have a high-density layout 
compared with the regular Max 8 – also specifically referred to the variant as the 737-8200 when they were 
published for comment last year.
EASA
'New' name for Ryanair 737 Max is not actually new; While several media reports are claiming that Ryanair has 
rebranded the Boeing 737 Max, in the aftermath of ....
Ryanair is intending to take its version of the aircraft, which was also previously known as the 'Max 200', with a 197-
seat layout.
There is no immediate evidence that other 737 Max operators are similarly changing the name of the aircraft on the 
fuselage. The '-8200' designation would only apply to Ryanair and other users of the high-density variant. Asian 
low-cost carrier VietJet has also signed for this version while Russian budget operator Pobeda has shown interest 
in converting to the type.
Other operators of the Max fitted in standard configurations have typically received aircraft with the name '737 Max 
8' or '737 Max 9' on the fuselage. There is no immediate indication that customers are moving to adapt these 
designators, although they could conceivably follow the Ryanair example and use the variants' formal '737-8' or 
'737-9' identifiers.

I n almost five decades of flying I have never seen a disruptive passenger, an out-of-control drunk or even heard an 
angry voice. It seems I have been lucky.
A survey by Which? Travel, the UK consumer magazine, found that 17 per cent of Ryanair passengers had 
witnessed shouting, drunkenness or verbal abuse by other passengers over the previous year.
Eight per cent had seen the same on Emirates and Virgin Atlantic flights. Questioned by Unite, the trade union, 87 
per cent of cabin crew on UK-based airlines said they had seen drunk passengers behaving badly.
Is this primarily a British problem? The International Air Transport Association says the number of disruptive 
passenger incidents worldwide has risen sharply. But in 2017, the last year for which it provides figures, there was 
only one disruptive incident for every 1,053 flights and, of those, 86 per cent were verbal outbursts that "can usually 
be brought to a successful conclusion by crew using de-escalation training".
The remainder were serious, involving physical aggression, damage to the aircraft or, in rare cases, attempts to 
enter the cockpit.
However rare or frequent, disruption in the air is frightening. Airline staff should not have to put up with it.
Alcohol lies behind much of the trouble. Iata said it was a factor in 27 per cent of incidents and UK reports refer to it 
frequently.
Business Travel
What can be done? While the airlines complain about drunk passengers, they serve alcohol freely on some flights 
and profit from on-board drinks sales on others.
The carriers respond that many passengers start drinking before they fly. A survey by Alcohol Change UK found 
that one in five British holidaymakers started drinking at the airport.
Sellers of drink airside in England are not subject to the licensing constraints that affect other pubs, such as 
restrictions on discounts and an obligation to enforce an age verification policy and seek local government approval 
for their opening hours.
According to a Home Office document, the laissez-faire attitude to airport drinking came from a sense of national 
embarrassment.
In 1956, Harold Watkinson, the then-aviation minister, said foreign passengers travelling through UK airports found 
pub opening times bewildering "and one may forgive them if they do not always understand why it is that they 
cannot always obtain a drink". So airside outlets were told they could do pretty much what they wished.
Now the embarrassment is on the other side, with too many people availing themselves of this liberality. The UK 
government is consulting on whether to impose restrictions on departure lounge drinks. But if that happens, what of

I n almost five decades of flying I have never seen a disruptive passenger, an out-of-control drunk or even heard an 
angry voice. It seems I have been lucky.
A survey by Which? Travel, the UK consumer magazine, found that 17 per cent of Ryanair passengers had 
witnessed shouting, drunkenness or verbal abuse by other passengers over the previous year.
Eight per cent had seen the same on Emirates and Virgin Atlantic flights. Questioned by Unite, the trade union, 87 
per cent of cabin crew on UK-based airlines said they had seen drunk passengers behaving badly.
Is this primarily a British problem? The International Air Transport Association says the number of disruptive 
passenger incidents worldwide has risen sharply. But in 2017, the last year for which it provides figures, there was 
only one disruptive incident for every 1,053 flights and, of those, 86 per cent were verbal outbursts that "can usually 
be brought to a successful conclusion by crew using de-escalation training".
The remainder were serious, involving physical aggression, damage to the aircraft or, in rare cases, attempts to 
enter the cockpit.
However rare or frequent, disruption in the air is frightening. Airline staff should not have to put up with it.
Alcohol lies behind much of the trouble. Iata said it was a factor in 27 per cent of incidents and UK reports refer to it 
frequently.

What can be done? While the airlines complain about drunk passengers, they serve alcohol freely on some flights 
and profit from on-board drinks sales on others.
The carriers respond that many passengers start drinking before they fly. A survey by Alcohol Change UK found 
that one in five British holidaymakers started drinking at the airport.
Sellers of drink airside in England are not subject to the licensing constraints that affect other pubs, such as 
restrictions on discounts and an obligation to enforce an age verification policy and seek local government approval 
for their opening hours.
According to a Home Office document, the laissez-faire attitude to airport drinking came from a sense of national 
embarrassment.
In 1956, Harold Watkinson, the then-aviation minister, said foreign passengers travelling through UK airports found 
pub opening times bewildering "and one may forgive them if they do not always understand why it is that they 
cannot always obtain a drink". So airside outlets were told they could do pretty much what they wished.
Now the embarrassment is on the other side, with too many people availing themselves of this liberality. The UK

 Vinci SA on Friday reported high-single-digit growth in passenger numbers across its airport network, helped by the 
development of new routes.
The French infrastructure company said passenger numbers across its Airports division increased by 7.3% in the 
three months to the end of June to 66.2 million compared to the same period in 2018. Over the first half of 2019, 
traffic grew by 6.7%.
Vinci said the growth reflects the opening of new airline links, often for the first time, between its airports facilities 
and world capitals. The company's Airports unit has 46 airports in the network. 
Geographically, in Portugal, passenger numbers rose 7.8% in the second quarter across the 10 facilities operated 
by Vinci Airports. The growth was boosted by Qatar Airways, which opened the first direct link between Lisbon and 
Doha in June, and TAP Air Portugal, which introduced its first service to Washington DC.
In France, Clermont-Ferrand Airport saw passenger number increasing by 3.4% year-on-year after introduction of a 
new, regular service to Lisbon operated by Ryanair Holdings PLC.
In the UK, passenger numbers at London Gatwick airport, which was added the VINCI Airports business in May, 
rose 1.7% in the second quarter to 12.5 million. Belfast Airport saw its traffic increase by 5.6% over the same 
period.
"The development of new routes is central to the value creation project of Vinci Airports, which has adopted a 
proactive approach in partnership with airlines," said Nicolas Notebaert, president of Vinci Airports. 
He added: "By facilitating tourist, commercial and cultural exchanges, each new link helps to promote the host 
country and boost its economic growth."
Vinci shares were trading 0.9% higher in Paris on Friday at EUR90.48 each.

Like several others before it, Eurowings has thrown in the towel on low-cost long-haul. That will allow it and parent 
Lufthansa to instead focus on getting the short-haul aspect of its operations right: a crucial task as it battles 
increasing competition in Germany from sleeker, nimbler rivals Ryanair and EasyJet.
Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr admitted that Eurowings had bitten off more than it could chew, especially 
after acquiring parts of collapsed rival Air Berlin, describing it as "the elephant in the room" at a capital-markets day 
on 24 June.
"We knew we needed a second platform for long-range. We threw it over the fence to Eurowings," he told analysts. 
"Probably I have to take the blame that Eurowings was trying to solve too many of the open issues of the Lufthansa 
group within the Eurowings business model."
Lufthansa has since resolved some of those legacy issues within its mainline, improving productivity and removing 
scope clauses, meaning it has other options for long-haul, Spohr notes. Eurowings' long-haul business will 
therefore be handed over to the network airlines, and Brussels Airlines will no longer be integrated into the budget 
unit.
Still, much work remains to be done at Eurowings on the short-haul front – where the carrier faces increased 
competition in Germany and Austria, along with overcapacity in Europe, and is grappling with an untidy structure 
and fleet as a result of acquisitions.
Eurowings made a profit of 60 million in 2017 but slumped to a loss of 231 million ($256 million) last year following 
the Air Berlin deal and a chaotic summer for passengers with delays and cancellations. Lufthansa is now aiming for

breakeven only in 2021, and an adjusted EBIT margin of 7% in the long term. That compares with an expected 
EBIT margin of between -4 and -6% this year. EasyJet, which Eurowings has oft cited as a comparable rival, 
recorded an operating profit margin of almost 8% for its 2018 financial year.
"We will create a new Eurowings, a complete new set-up compared with today's set-up – a much leaner, a much 
more focused company, simplified and right sized," said Eurowings head Thorsten Dirks at the capital-markets day.
SELF-HELP
Among the measures is focusing on its home markets, with bases at Dusseldorf, Cologne, Hamburg and Stuttgart 
set to take the lead, prompting unions to query what will happen with its other bases. Eurowings will also centre its 
fleet on A320s, discontinuing its wet-lease arrangements for seven Boeing 737s and crew with TUI and the 15 
Bombardier Dash 8 turboprops it gained via the takeover of Air Berlin unit LGW (targeted mainly for its slots at 
German airports). That will increase its average seats per aircraft to 167 in 2022, from 149 today. The oldest Airbus 
narrowbodies will also be rolled over with A320neos: starting with four in 2021 and 16 in 2022. Overall, its current 
fleet of 139 aircraft will shrink by 10-20%.
In addition, Eurowings is simplifying its AOC structure in Germany, because aircraft and crew cannot be switched 
from one AOC to another easily. It has cut down to two and is looking to reduce it down to one – whether that will 
be the Germanwings or the Eurowings Germany AOC is not yet known. It will maintain its Eurowings Europe AOC 
in Vienna.
In addition, Eurowings wants to achieve higher productivity from its crews, increasing the block-hour rate per crew 
to 750h per year by 2022, from 539 now.
Ryanair pilots flew an average 822 hours per year, according to its 2018 annual report.
Overall, Eurowings has set itself a target for cost per average seat-kilometre flown (CASK) to fall 15% by 2022.
While Eurowings does have these "self-help" levers it can pull, Bernstein analysts predict tough times ahead for 
Lufthansa. Downgrading the German group and British Airways owner IAG earlier this month, the analysts warned 
the industry was in the late stage of the cycle and that an expected flood of aircraft deliveries next year as Max 
deliveries restart will not ease overcapacity issues. While Lufthansa has strong positions in its hubs in Frankfurt, 
Munich, Vienna and Zurich, which will serve it well longer term, it will likely have to accept lower yields in the short 
term as Ryanair expands in the secondary German hubs of Dusseldorf, Cologne, Hamburg and Stuttgart, the 
Bernstein analysts said.
Still, Lufthansa remains upbeat. "The attackers are losing more than the defenders," argues Spohr. He notes that 
while Eurowings lost 1 million per aircraft in Germany last year, the equivalent losses for Ryanair and EasyJet out of 
Germany were higher at 7-8 million.
Its hands full with Eurowings, Lufthansa may have a waning appetite for more M&A too. Lufthansa has bid for 
Condor, Thomas Cook's German airline. But highlighting Condor’s low margins, high capex needs and pension 
obligations and the seller's price expectations, finance chief Ulrik Svensson said at the capital-markets day that 
Lufthansa would be unlikely to win the bidding process. Thomas Cook has now put the sale process on hold, 
instead opting for a refinancing that will see shareholder Fosun take a majority stake in the tour-operating business 
and a minority stake in the airline.
Summing up at the 24 June event, Spohr was keen to highlight how being German, reliable and dependable is an 
advantage for his company as it works through its issues.
"In the end, we're boring, we're German, we're Lufthansa. We love to be boring. We all know we can do things 
better. I think we were quite open about correcting some things we did wrong in Eurowings. We'll fix them as fast as 
we can," says Spohr.

Highlight: During the second quarter of 2019, passenger numbers across the VINCI Airports network increased by 
7.3% compared to the second quarter of 2018, with a total of 66.2 million passengers handled by 46 airports in the 
network.

Highlights: Passenger traffic up 7.3% in the 2nd quarter (+6.7% in the 1st half of 2019)Sustained growth in virtually 
all countries of operationEver-increasing number of destinations to better serve regions and countriesThe quarter 
saw high rates of growth in most of VINCI Airports' countries of operation.  Over the first half of 2019, traffic grew by 
6.7%. Ever-increasing number of destinations to better serve regions and countries These good results reflect in 
particular the opening of numerous new airline links, often for the first time, between VINCI Airports facilities and 
world capitals. In Portugal, for instance, where passenger numbers rose 7.8% in the second quarter across the 
10 facilities operated by VINCI Airports, Qatar Airways opened the first direct link between Lisbon and Doha in 
June, while TAP Air Portugal introduced its first service to Washington DC. In Serbia, work done by VINCI Airports 
with airlines since its arrival at the end of 2018 led to the return of Air France, which reopened its Paris-Belgrade 
service after a six-year absence. In addition, Wizz Air opened a new link between the Serbian capital and Lyon-
Saint Exupéry Airport, which is also operated by VINCI Airports. 
Passenger numbers at Belgrade airport rose 7.4% in the second quarter of 2019. In Japan, the Kansai airports 
recorded 7.6% growth in passenger numbers compared with the second quarter of 2018. Since 31 March 2019, 
British Airways, under a codeshare agreement with Japan Airlines, has been operating a direct service between 
Kansai International Airport and London Heathrow, following 21 years of absence. Of particular note was the 
exceptional effort made by the Kansai airports during the G20 in Osaka on 28 and 29 June: over 30,000 
participants, including 37 heads of state, heads of governments, national delegations and major international 
organisations, were handled without interrupting day-to-day operations. In Cambodia, the three facilities operated 
by VINCI Airports posted again an excellent performance, with growth of 25.1% in the second quarter. In June, 
Emirates opened a new daily service between Phnom Penh and Dubai, while Citilink inaugurated the first direct 
flight between Phnom Penh and Jakarta. In France, Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport, where passenger numbers rose 
7.7%, received the ACI Best Airport Award for the 10-15 million passenger category at the end of June, rewarding 
VINCI Airports announces Q2 2019 traffic
VINCI Airports' commitment to meeting the growing demand for air travel while enhancing quality of service. Nantes 
airport continued its sound growth (+20.5%), driven mainly by the opening of an easyJet base in April. Other French 
airports in the VINCI Airports network also broadened their range of destinations, including Clermont-Ferrand 
(+3.4%), which has a new, regular service to Lisbon operated by Ryanair. In the United Kingdom, passenger 
numbers at London Gatwick airport, which joined the VINCI Airports network in May 2019, rose 1.7% in the second 
quarter to 12.5 million. Belfast Airport saw its traffic increase by 5.6% over the period. In Brazil, the cessation of 
domestic flights by Avianca Brasil after it filed for bankruptcy protection in December 2018 resulted in an occasional 
decline in Salvador airport passenger numbers  (-12.9%) in the second quarter. VINCI Airports' commercial teams 
remain however confident in the Salvador de Bahia region's growth potential, which has been boosted by the 
regional government's recent decision to reduce the tax on domestic flights (ICMS) for airlines developing air travel 
in the State of Bahia. In Dominican Republic, after a difficult year 2018, marked by the bankruptcy of several 
airlines, traffic is on the rise again in the six airports operated by VINCI Airports (+14.2% in the second quarter). 
Nicolas Notebaert, President of VINCI Airports and chief executive officer of VINCI Concessions, said: "The 
development of new routes is central to the value creation project of VINCI Airports, which has adopted a proactive 
approach in partnership with airlines. By facilitating tourist, commercial and cultural exchanges, each new link helps 
to promote the host country and boost its economic growth."

Norwegian Air Shuttle chief executive Bjorn Kjos said his departure was "way overdue" as he announced plans to 
step down after 17 years in the role with a parting warning over profits.
The 72-year-old former fighter pilot said: "You shouldn't lead an airline past your seventies." He added that the 
grounding of Boeing's 737 Max aircraft would hit results.
The co-founder of the airline leaves at a difficult time for the group, with shares down more than 75 per cent since 
April 2018 and finances stretched after plans to take on transatlantic airlines in long haul.
Norwegian is the third-largest lowcost carrier in Europe behind Ryanair and easyJet .
Mr Kjos will become an adviser to the chairman. Geir Karlsen , chief financial officer, will step in as interim chief 
executive.
The group, which reported a fall in net profits of NKr82.8m in the second quarter compared with NKr300m a year 
earlier, has struggled under Mr Kjos, trying to be a low-cost European and transatlantic airline as well as Norway's 
flag carrier.

It shifted strategy earlier this year, promising an end to rapid growth that saw it launch low-cost transatlantic flights 
in 2012.
The company expects that the grounding of the 737 Max 8 jets after crashes in March this year and October 2018 
will hit results to the tune of Nkr700m ($81.8m).
The group, which ran 18 Max 8 aircraft out of a fleet of about 160 planes, expects that the jet will be back in 
operation in October.
Niels Smedegaard, chairman, said: "We have to ensure that Norwegian is well prepared and positioned to handle 
volatile markets and unexpected events. It is crucial that we continue to deliver on our cost reduction initiatives."
Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, said the group was "levered to the hilt, and we haven't seen any major 
airline walk away from that mountain of debt without a bankruptcy." While the results are in line with expectations, 
"the crucial months will be over winter".
Bernstein said in a note that Mr Kjos had been the driving force behind the business. "The big question now is 
whether Norwegian can maintain momentum as he takes a less active role ."
Andrew Lobbenberg, a HSBC analyst, said the strategy had changed under Mr Kjos from his "original growth 
orientation to a new focus on profitability". Problems at the carrier were highlighted in January this year as it 
announced an emergency rights issue of NKr3bn, more than half the airline's equity value.
At the time of the rights issue, Norwegian said that it was no longer in takeover talks after a potential bid from IAG, 
owner of British Airways , failed to materialise.
Mr Kjos said there was no intention of raising more equity.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) may close some of its bases and is offering unpaid leaves and job shares to pilots as a 
result of delays in the delivery of new Boeing (BA) 737 Max airplanes, according to The Irish Times.
Peter Bellew, chief operating officer of Ryanair, reportedly told pilots Wednesday that delays in the delivery of the 
Boeing planes will slash its winter fleet and may potentially affect next summer. The 737 Max airplanes are 
grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes by Indonesian and Ethiopian airliners
Bellew said that the problems may require the company base downsizing and/or closures this winter and next 
summer, which is dependent on the start date of the 737 Max deliveries, according to the report.
The COO added that the company has a surplus of 300 pilots and has stopped recruitment of captains since 
resignations have dried up, the report said.
Ryanair was scheduled to receive 50 737 Max aircraft through the closing months of 2019 and Q1 2020, the report 
said.

Jul 11, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair 
passengers traveling from Manchester to Croatia on July 5, endured hours of 'hell' after 70 drunk attendees to a 
festival stormed the plane and created a nuisance.Aneta Zukow, 24, and boyfriend, 32-year-old Piotr Nesan, were 
on the three-and-a-half-hour flight when the group of party-goers stormed into the flight and started yelling for 
hours. They also refused to listen to the crew and vomited down the aisle.Video of the incident showed the travelers 
shouting at each other before one of them vomits and passes out. 
Throughout, his mates laughed and continued to scream.Calling them uncontrollable[1], Zukow said nobody was 
able to calm them down and that most of them ignored the safety instructions. Describing the situation as that of "a 
nightclub without the music,' she said three of them were taken into custody by police once the flight landed at the 
destination.Describing the entire incident, Zukow said, "It was like being in a jungle with wild animals. It was hell on 
earth. It was the worst flight of my life. It was absolutely appalling. The only way I can describe it is like being in a 
nightclub without the music 10,000ft above the ground. They were shouting, chanting and the crew could not calm 
them down.'"They were uncontrollable. No one could calm them down. It was completely unacceptable. All of them 
were drunk. The cabin crew threatened to throw them off several times. They were basically having a party on the 
plane. They were animals. It was obvious they were drunk when they boarded the plane. No one was allowed to 
buy alcohol for the whole flight because they were so drunk. It was unacceptable. The police came on when we 
landed before anyone was allowed to get off. Three of them were taken away. They were being arrested. It was a 
horrible experience,' she added.Confirming the incident, a Ryanair spokesperson said, 'The crew of this flight from 
Manchester to Zadar (July 5) requested police assistance upon arrival after a number of passengers became 
disruptive. The aircraft landed normally and police removed the individuals. The safety and comfort of our 
customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority and this is now a matter for local police." In this

meeting, but likely to depend on data for any further cut after July.

Ryanair chief operating officer Peter Bellew has confirmed that he is standing down at the end of the year.
Bellew was recruited by Ryanair in December 2017, leaving his position as chief executive of Malaysia Airlines.
At the time, Ryanair was in the midst of a rostering issue which caused a mass wave of cancellations, and the 
carrier said Bellew would be tasked with ensuring such a situation would never be repeated.
Since then, Ryanair has agreed to recognise unions and has set up agreements with pilots and cabin crew on most 
of its major markets. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said in May that he was confident there would be no labour 
disruption this summer, and that the carrier had sorted its pilot requirements for both this and next summer.
Bellew today says operations are "in great shape, with a super team in place".
Reuters earlier reported his planned departure, citing a memo to staff sent by chief executive Michael O'Leary.

small market in terms of the number of players, people need all the players to be able to continue to trade in a 
relatively frictionless way," he told the Financial Times at the Paris Air Show in June.
Industry figures said a negotiated settlement was badly needed to clearly set out what was allowed in state 
aerospace subsidies. Paul Everitt, chief executive of Britain's aerospace and defence industry trade body ADS, 
said: "The widening of the dispute to other sectors is unhelpful to the global economy; nobody will win from this 
process."
Airbus, in reference to the additional goods targeted by the US, said the move only "adds to the trade tensions", 
and warned that it was "not creating a healthy environment for working towards a negotiated solution".
Boeing struck an uncompromising tone, saying in a statement: "Unfortunately we are on the brink of tariffs today 
because Airbus and the EU have ignored their WTO obligations for 15 years," the company said.
For workers at the Airbus plant in Mobile and its suppliers, the stakes are high: the plant imports wings, fuselages 
and other structures for the A320. Such aerospace components are all on America's list of proposed goods for 
tariffs. At a hearing in May held by the US Trade Representative about the proposed tariffs, Boeing said 
Washington should focus its duties "on Airbus products and assemblies to the greatest extent possible", arguing it 
was not about punishment but about enforcing compliance with the WTO ruling.
But it is also a battle about jobs. Airbus's $600m-plus investment in the southern state has been welcomed by local 
politicians who do not want to see it harmed.
small market in terms of [...]
Giving evidence at the same hearing, Mobile's mayor Sandy Stimpson said Airbus was "the linchpin for our success 
in building an aircraft manufacturing ecosystem". "These are American workers building American products, paying 
American taxes and raising American families," he said.
An EU case against Boeing is running about six to nine months behind the WTO.
While Boeing does not assemble aeroplanes in Europe, it does have a big customer base among airlines including 
Ryanair and Lufthansa. The EU said in April it was seeking punitive tariffs on $12bn worth of US exports.
The battle between the two companies dates back to 2004 when the US initially raised concerns with the WTO. The 
EU followed suit and filed a counter-case alleging illegal state aid to Boeing. The original concerns focused on 
subsidies given to the A380 and A350, and Boeing's 787 and 777X jets.
Aerospace analysts say it is difficult to quantify the exact impact of any tariffs on the industry as it is not yet clear at 
what level and where they will fall.
Robert Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said the terms "are so vague it is tough to put a number on 
the impact".
Any costs would likely be passed on to suppliers and airline customers, but ultimately any higher charges would be 
"passed on to the consumer", he added.
Other industry stakeholders warn an escalation into a trade war would be harmful to everyone and damage what is 
a global supply chain.
A trade war would mean "higher costs, less choice and less competition on both sides. Ultimately, it is consumers 
that will have to pay for it," said one European industry figure.

 Britain's aviation sector could see severe disruption in the medium-term if it leaves the European Union without a 
withdrawal agreement, Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) CEO Michael O'Leary warned Wednesday. 
"There are measures that are being put in place both by Europe and the UK that would prevent enormous 
disruption over the first 9 or 12 months but after that if there is a hard Brexit and no trade deal there could well be 
severe disruption," O'Leary was cited as saying in a news report from Reuters.
Shares drifted marginally lower intraday, trading near the bottom end of their 52-week price range of $60.83 - 
$118.76.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) CEO Michael O'Leary told Reutes in an interview prolonged grounding of Boeing's (BA) 
737 MAX on the airline's growth plans may start to spill over to next summer if the airplane is not flying again by 
November.
The airline needs up to eight months to take delivery of some 50 newly built planes left at the factory by the 
grounding crisis, so it may have to trim its capacity growth plans for summer 2020 if 737 MAX flights have not 
resumed by November, O'Leary reportedly said.
He said Boeing has been telling the company the 737 MAX should be flying by the end of Sept.

3.04% FRANCE will introduce a tax on airlines flying from its airports to help support the environment, its transport 
minister said yesterday, in a move expected to raise around (EURO)180m (£159.4m) from 2020.
2.00% Shares in airlines across Europe fell on the news, with Air France and Easyjet down just over three per cent, 
Lufthansa down two per cent and Ryanair down almost five per cent yesterday.
The tax will be (EURO)1.50 for flights within France or the European Union, (EURO)3 for economy flights out of the 
EU, (EURO)9 for intra-EU business class and up to (EURO)18 for business class tickets out of the EU. Transit 
flights will not be taxed.
Transport minister Elisabeth Borne said proceeds would be used to finance daily transport in France, notably local 
trains.
Air France said the tax would significantly hurt its competitiveness and represent an additional cost of more than 
(EURO)60m per year.
The French government also said that from 2020 it expected to raise (EURO)140m from reducing tax benefits on 
diesel for trucks.

France to slap new 'ecotax' on plane tickets from 2020
France to slap new 'ecotax' on plane tickets from 2020

PARIS (AP) - France will introduce a new charge on plane tickets from next year, with revenue used to fund 
environment-friendly alternatives, the country's transport minister said Tuesday.
The "ecotax" costing between 1.50 euros ($1.7) and 18 euros ($20) will apply to most flights departing in France, 
Elisabeth Borne said.
The only exceptions will be for domestic flights to Corsica and France's overseas territories, and connecting flights 
that pass through France. It will not apply to flights arriving in France.
Shares in Air France/KLM and budget airlines EasyJet and Ryanair dropped following the announcement.
Industry group IATA, which favors a system that allows airlines to offset their emissions by paying for carbon 
reduction efforts elsewhere, called the French ticket charge "misguided."
"National taxes will do nothing to assist the aviation industry in its sustainability efforts," IATA spokesman Anthony 
Concil said, warning that instead of helping airlines invest in cleaner fuels and technology it could end up harming 
the French aviation industry and jeopardize jobs.
But the move received a cautious welcome from environmental campaigners, who argue that the airline industry 
needs to curb its greenhouse gas emissions as part of wider efforts to combat climate change.
"This alone won't do much, but it's at least a recognition by the French government that more is required," said 
Andrew Murphy, an air travel expert at Brussels-based group Transport and Environment.
According to Borne, domestic and European flights will be taxed at 1.50 euros for economy tickets and 9 euros 
($10) for business class, rising to 18 euros for business flights outside the EU.
By comparison, Britain's air passenger duty for standard passenger planes starts at 13 pounds ($16.20), rising to a 
maximum of 172 pounds ($214.20), and generates more than 3 billion pounds in Treasury revenue every year.
France to slap new 'ecotax' on plane tickets from 2020
The French tax is expected to raise over 180 million euros ($200 million) from 2020 to invest in eco-friendly 
transport infrastructure, including rail. It comes on top of a similar ticket charge introduced over a decade ago by 
former French President Jacques Chirac, the proceeds of which go toward medical aid for poor countries.
Murphy said the French move could boost efforts to introduce a Europe-wide tax on aviation to reflect plane travel's 
environmental impact.
Germany, Italy and some Nordics nations also have ticket taxes. Several European countries are meanwhile 
pushing for the VAT exemption that airline fuel enjoys in Europe to be dropped.
Germany's Environment Ministry said Tuesday it supports discussions on additional CO2-based pricing systems for 
air travel to reduce the industry's contribution to man-made greenhouse gas emissions, currently estimated at more 
than 2% but forecast to grow significantly in coming decades.
"What's more, the conditions for competition between air, road and rail travel need to be made fairer," the ministry 
said in a statement. "This is something we in Europe need to achieve together."

       Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) said that its CO2 per passenger/km for June 2019 was 66g, 
almost half the rate of other flag carrier European airlines. 
 Ryanair also published environmental taxes to dispel the myth that airlines pay no environmental taxes. Ryanair 
paid over 540 million euros in environment taxes in 2018 and will pay over 630 million euros in 2019, up 17%. This 
equates to 4.12 euros per passenger, which is 11% of Ryanair's average air fare.

       U.K. stocks shrugged off weak regional leads to edge higher on Tuesday, with financials and energy stocks 
leading the surge. 
 The benchmark FTSE 100 was up 37 points or 0.50 percent at 7,535 in opening deals after rallying around 1 
percent on Monday. 
 Elsewhere, major markets in Germany and France were subdued after U.S. President Donald Trump said on 
Monday that any trade deal with China would need to be somewhat tilted in favor of the United States, raising 
doubts over the U.S-China trade truce.
 Also, the United States has intensified its fight with the European Union over aircraft subsidies, proposing tariffs on 
$4 billion of additional EU goods.
 Asia-focused lender HSBC Holdings rose 0.8 percent, Standard Chartered gained 0.7 percent and Prudential 
added 0.8 percent. 
 BP Plc rose about 1 percent and Royal Dutch Shell gained half a percent after OPEC agreed to extend oil supply 
cuts until March 2020.
 Advertising giant WPP fell over 2 percent. The company confirmed that it has entered into exclusive discussions to 
sell a majority shareholding in Kantar to Bain Capital for a headline enterprise value of about $4 billion.
 Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings advanced 0.6 percent after reporting growth in passenger traffic figures for 
June. 
 Hill & Smith Holdings gained 1 percent after it appointed Hannah Nichols as Chief Financial Officer and a member 
of the Board.
FTSE 100 Edges Higher In Cautious Trade
 Jupiter Fund Management slumped 6.7 percent after the company said it is considering naming Devon Equity as 
an adviser for its European Opportunities Trust. 
 In economic releases, U.K. house prices increased at a slightly slower pace in June, data from Nationwide Building 
Society showed.
 House prices rose 0.5 percent year-on-year in June, following a 0.6 percent increase in May. Nonetheless, this was 
faster than the expected 0.2 percent rise.
 The U.K. construction sector contracted the most in more than a decade in June, survey data from IHS Markit 
revealed. 
 The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply Purchasing Managers' Index fell unexpectedly to 43.1 
in June from 48.6 in May. The reading was forecast to rise to 49.2.

Jul 01, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A passenger on 
board a Ryanair flight was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. Authorities said that a group of 
passengers heading to a beach music festival in Croatia on Saturdayturned "rowdy" before takeoff from 
theManchester Airport inEngland.Police were called when trouble erupted, causing a two-hour delay to 
flightFR9501 to Zadar. 
Authorities said one of the passengersallegedly tried to punch a female official at the boarding gate, Manchester 
Evening News reported. The passenger who was arrested was not named.Other officials intervened and the 
passenger was told he would not be allowed to fly. The rest of the group was also warned. The drama led to a delay 
for those heading to Hideout Festival at Zrće beach in Croatia.An eyewitness said some of the passengers had 
gone through the gate and then were told to return to the terminal before boarding."The gate agents of this flight 
from Manchester to Zadar (June 29) requested police assistance ahead of take off after a small number of 
passengers became disruptive, and one passenger was denied boarding," Ryanair said in a statement, according 
to U.K.'s Mirror Online.[1] "The safety and comfort of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority. 
The flight departed to Zadar following a short delay."A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police confirmed

Ryanair 's Q1 profit drops 21%

Ryanair has blamed higher fuel costs, downward pressure on fares and the integration of Lauda for a 21% fall in its 
first-quarter profit.
The low-cost carrier says post-tax profits fell to (EURO)243 million ($270 million) in the period to 30 June from 
(EURO)309 million in the same quarter in 2018.
Revenues grew 11% to (EURO)2.31 billion from (EURO)2.08 billion.
Costs rose 19% to (EURO)2.04 billion from (EURO)1.71 billion. Ryanair says its fuel bill rose 24% to (EURO)784 
million from (EURO)631 million while integrating its Austrian subsidiary also pushed up its costs.
Gross cash increased by (EURO)921 million to (EURO)4.12 billion, while gross debt rose by (EURO)891 million to 
(EURO)4.54 billion due to a new (EURO)750 million "low-cost" syndicated bank facility and the (EURO)223 million 
impact of IFRS 16 accounting. The airline made (EURO)80 million of debt repayments during the period.
Cash and cash equivalents stood at (EURO)2.02 billion at end of the quarter, from (EURO)1.35 billion in the same 
quarter a year before.
The Irish carrier says that delivery of its first five Boeing 737 Max aircraft has been delayed until January 2020 "at 
the earliest". Ryanair now estimates it will only receive 30 Max aircraft by the summer of 2020, from the 58 it 
previously expected.
Aircraft rental payments fell by 18% to (EURO)14.7 million as a result of six leased 737s being phased out during 
the period and the effects of changes to its accounting methods.
 The airline is guiding for a "flat" full-year post tax profit in a range of (EURO)750 million to (EURO)950 million.

Lufthansa profit falls in Q2
Lufthansa profit falls in Q2

Lufthansa Group's operating profit fell 25% in the second quarter on the back of rising fuel prices, pressure on 
yields and competition in its European markets.
The Star Alliance group made an operating profit of (EURO)754 million ($840 million), down from (EURO)1 billion in 
the same quarter last year.
Group revenues rose by 4% to (EURO)9.6 billion, from (EURO)9.3 billion, while operating costs rose 7% to 
(EURO)9.5 billion.
Profits across the group's network carriers, which includes Austrian, Lufthansa mainline and Swiss, fell 16% to 
(EURO)725 million from (EURO)861 million. The Star Alliance says that "substantial" fuel price rises incurred by the 
carriers could not be passed on to customers.
Eurowings' losses doubled to (EURO)16 million from (EURO)8 million, with the German airline group warning the 
budget carrier's profits are under "significant pressure".
The group's cargo division incurred a (EURO)9 million loss, while at MRO arm Lufthansa Technik operating profit 
fell to (EURO)118 million from (EURO)120 million.
"Our earnings are feeling the effects of tough competition in Europe and sizeable overcapacities, especially on our 
short-haul routes out of Germany and Austria," said Lufthansa chief financial officer Ulrik Svensson.
"We are responding to this by further reducing our costs and increasing our flexibility. And with the turnaround plan 
which we recently presented, we also intend to make Eurowings a sustainably profitable airline."
The group experienced a "solid performance" on Asian routes, while its Middle East and African operational 
performance "improves". Its services to South America continue to cause a "drag".
Speaking on an analysts call today, Svensson says the group's free cash flow position declined to a "negative 
number" during the quarter.
Svensson says yields in Europe, particularly Germany and Austria, remain "under pressure" because of market-
wide overcapacity, "aggressive competition" and increasingly price-sensitive demand.
Lufthansa profit falls in Q2
He expects Lufthansa's European carriers to remain locked in a "very tough price" competition with Ryanair and 
EasyJet this year and in 2020.
Svensson adds that the Lufthansa Group expects to complete the sale of LSG Europe this year.

Two former executives of Wow Air are planning to resurrect the Icelandic carrier under the provisional name of 
WAB Air.
Arnar Magnusson and Svein Steinporsson plan to hold 25% of WAB (We Are Back) through their company Neo, 
while 75% will be owned by Avianta Capital, an Irish investment fund owned by Aislinn Whittley-Ryan, part of the 
family that founded Ryanair.
Avianta aims to commit ISK5 billion ($39.2m) for its stake, reports Icelandic business publication Marka&urinn, with 
$30 million of that funding to be sourced from Icelandic banks Arion Bank and Landsbankinn under one-year loans.
Plans are for WAB Air to start flights as soon as this autumn and then expand within a year to six aircraft serving 14 
destinations in Europe and the US.
Wow Air's former chief executive officer, Skuli Morgensen, is not involved in the new venture.

The wandering rocks; Kevin Barry's novel wears its Beckettian influences

K evin Barry's first novel, City of Bohane, was a cinematic gangster noir set in a fictional city in the west of Ireland in 
a dystopian, technology-free future. It was a swaggering, dazzling book, studded with a kind of Hibernian version of 
A Clockwork Orange's nadsat, and it won Barry the IMPAC prize for fiction in 2013.
His second, Beatlebone, for which he won the Goldsmiths Prize in 2015, was a quieter affair, though no less 
satisfying for that. A formally inventive quest narrative, it followed John Lennon as he travelled to Dorinish, the small 
island in County Mayo he bought in 1967, where he hoped to escape from the world for a few days and indulge in 
some primal scream therapy. Barry seems always to have been interested in the tension between the smallness of 
Ireland - the "little kingdom" that Lennon describes in Beatlebone (a phrase also used in the title of Barry's first 
short-story collection) - and the expansiveness of its writing, and this tension is one that animates his third novel.
Night Boat to Tangier feels like something of a fusion of his previous books. It opens as two "fading Irish gangsters" 
- Maurice "Moss" Hearne and Charlie Redman - sit in a ferry terminal in the southern Spanish port of Algeciras. The 
terminal, a non-place through which walk-on characters can drift, makes a good stage set, and it's hard to avoid 
comparisons with Beckett. Like Vladimir and Estragon, Moss and Charlie are waiting. They're waiting for Moss's 
estranged daughter Dilly to pass through on her way to or from Tangier, but they're also waiting for death.
As night falls they harangue dreadlocked travellers who they think might know Dilly, and reminisce about their lives 
of drug smuggling, dodgy real estate speculation, low-level violence and lost love. Some chapters are set in the

past, in Ireland, London and other parts of Ryanair-accessible Europe, and describe Moss's relationship with Dilly's 
mother Cynthia, and his affairs. But most of the narrative is confined to the terminal, and the question of whether 
Dilly will ever arrive.
The partners' glory days are very much behind them. Cannabis is no longer smuggled: it's grown hydroponically in 
bedsits. The protection racket is not what it was. "The years have turned and left Maurice and Charlie behind", 
writes Barry, "the men are elegiacal, woeful, heavy in the bones. Also they are broke and grieving."
If the set-up evokes Beckett the dramatist, the language of Night Boat to Tangier is much more like that of Beckett 
the novelist. It is written in a kind of ornate pub-lyricism that casts into relief the grime and squalor of its subjects: a 
baroque High Style fused with low-life garrulousness that reminded me of the Beckett of Murphy, and of the trilogy. 
Descriptions are dense and evocative. Charlie's face "somehow has an antique look, like a court player's, medieval, 
a man who'd strum his lute for you"; Moss's "left eye is smeared and dead"; a landlord has "a papery film like 
mothskin stretched over his eyes"; the sea "guffs up a newsy froth" while a trawler, "flush with octopus", "waddles 
into port" and an SUV stops to "disgorge a unit of fat kids". The Beckettian influence is there, more explicitly, when 
Moss, exiled to London, sees, as Murphy did before him, "the lights of all the cages" of the city's lonely tenements 
go on, near the "great maw of Finsbury Park".
This is rich fare, and Barry's strident image-making can threaten to take over at times. Why need a payphone be a 
"coin phone"? Are a line of larches really "primly erect, arrogant as surgeons"? "Watch out for words most of all", 
Dilly thinks, knowingly enacting her own fears, at one point. "Watch out for ripe language - it means your words may 
be about to go off." Beckett eventually shied away from this kind of writing, as though wary of his innate fluency, 
and tried to rid his prose of its colour by composing in French before translating himself into English, but it is 
testament to Barry's ear that he is fully aware of the threat, and to his skill that his prose never reaches its sell-by 
date.
Like Murphy, Night Boat to Tangier is really about exile and loss, and about the way in which Ireland often seems 
unable to fully sustain and nourish its young. In the late 1990s, buoyed up by Celtic Tiger optimism, Cynthia and 
Moss invest his money in a swish housing development in the countryside (the builders are nervous about the 
proximity of a fairy fort, and the project founders). Later Red and Moss run away to the continent to seek their 
fortune. But abroad they only find disappointment.
For James Joyce's Stephen Dedalus, Ireland was the "sow that eats her farrow". For Moss and Charlie it is, with its 
"smiling friends" and "speaking rocks" and "sea memory", a haunted, claustrophobic place: a "wet tormented rock

K evin Barry's first novel, City of Bohane, was a cinematic gangster noir set in a fictional city in the west of Ireland in 
a dystopian, technology-free future. It was a swaggering, dazzling book, studded with a kind of Hibernian version of 
A Clockwork Orange's nadsat, and it won Barry the IMPAC prize for fiction in 2013.
His second, Beatlebone, for which he won the Goldsmiths Prize in 2015, was a quieter affair, though no less 
satisfying for that. A formally inventive quest narrative, it followed John Lennon as he travelled to Dorinish, the small 
island in County Mayo he bought in 1967, where he hoped to escape from the world for a few days and indulge in 
some primal scream therapy. Barry seems always to have been interested in the tension between the smallness of 
Ireland - the "little kingdom" that Lennon describes in Beatlebone (a phrase also used in the title of Barry's first 
short-story collection) - and the expansiveness of its writing, and this tension is one that animates his third novel.
Night Boat to Tangier feels like something of a fusion of his previous books. It opens as two "fading Irish gangsters" 
- Maurice "Moss" Hearne and Charlie Redman - sit in a ferry terminal in the southern Spanish port of Algeciras. The 
terminal, a non-place through which walk-on characters can drift, makes a good stage set, and it's hard to avoid 
comparisons with Beckett. Like Vladimir and Estragon, Moss and Charlie are waiting. They're waiting for Moss's 
estranged daughter Dilly to pass through on her way to or from Tangier, but they're also waiting for death.
As night falls they harangue dreadlocked travellers who they think might know Dilly, and reminisce about their lives 
of drug smuggling, dodgy real estate speculation, low-level violence and lost love. Some chapters are set in the

past, in Ireland, London and other parts of Ryanair-accessible Europe, and describe Moss's relationship with Dilly's 
mother Cynthia, and his affairs. But most of the narrative is confined to the terminal, and the question of whether 
Dilly will ever arrive.
The partners' glory days are very much behind them. Cannabis is no longer smuggled: it's grown hydroponically in 
bedsits. The protection racket is not what it was. "The years have turned and left Maurice and Charlie behind", 
writes Barry, "the men are elegiacal, woeful, heavy in the bones. Also they are broke and grieving."
If the set-up evokes Beckett the dramatist, the language of Night Boat to Tangier is much more like that of Beckett 
the novelist. It is written in a kind of ornate pub-lyricism that casts into relief the grime and squalor of its subjects: a 
baroque High Style fused with low-life garrulousness that reminded me of the Beckett of Murphy, and of the trilogy. 
Descriptions are dense and evocative. Charlie's face "somehow has an antique look, like a court player's, medieval, 
a man who'd strum his lute for you"; Moss's "left eye is smeared and dead"; a landlord has "a papery film like 
mothskin stretched over his eyes"; the sea "guffs up a newsy froth" while a trawler, "flush with octopus", "waddles 
into port" and an SUV stops to "disgorge a unit of fat kids". The Beckettian influence is there, more explicitly, when 
Moss, exiled to London, sees, as Murphy did before him, "the lights of all the cages" of the city's lonely tenements 
go on, near the "great maw of Finsbury Park".
This is rich fare, and Barry's strident image-making can threaten to take over at times. Why need a payphone be a 
"coin phone"? Are a line of larches really "primly erect, arrogant as surgeons"? "Watch out for words most of all", 
Dilly thinks, knowingly enacting her own fears, at one point. "Watch out for ripe language - it means your words may 
be about to go off." Beckett eventually shied away from this kind of writing, as though wary of his innate fluency, 
and tried to rid his prose of its colour by composing in French before translating himself into English, but it is 
testament to Barry's ear that he is fully aware of the threat, and to his skill that his prose never reaches its sell-by 
date.
Like Murphy, Night Boat to Tangier is really about exile and loss, and about the way in which Ireland often seems 
unable to fully sustain and nourish its young. In the late 1990s, buoyed up by Celtic Tiger optimism, Cynthia and 
Moss invest his money in a swish housing development in the countryside (the builders are nervous about the 
proximity of a fairy fort, and the project founders). Later Red and Moss run away to the continent to seek their 
fortune. But abroad they only find disappointment.
For James Joyce's Stephen Dedalus, Ireland was the "sow that eats her farrow". For Moss and Charlie it is, with its 
"smiling friends" and "speaking rocks" and "sea memory", a haunted, claustrophobic place: a "wet tormented rock 
on the edge of the black Atlantic". But it is also a place that it is difficult to escape the influence of.

Ryanair has ramped up efforts to keep the airline under majority EU ownership in a no-deal Brexit by triggering 
block purchases of shares from investors under a month-old (EURO)700m buyback scheme.
The Irish carrier's move comes amid anxiety about the rising risk of Britain crashing out of the bloc in the autumn as 
Boris Johnson, the favourite to succeed Theresa May as prime minister, pushes for a "do or die" Brexit in October 
even without a deal.
Jeremy Hunt, Mr Johnson's rival for the Conservative leadership, has also indicated that he too is willing to leave 
the EU with no agreement.
Ryanair fears a breach of its legal requirement to be majority-owned and controlled by European nationals after a 
no-deal as its share of EU shareholders would immediately drop to 45 per cent from 55 per cent without UK 
investors.
The question is one of the most complex facing airlines in the run-up to a possible no-deal, with doubt also cast 
over some carriers' supply chains for spare aircraft parts.
In a fresh bid to curtail the number of shares in the hands of non-Europeans, Ryanair yesterday rejigged the 
buyback scheme to allow block buybacks.
Ryanair allows block buyback of shares amid Brexit fears Airlines
"Any such block repurchases from UK holders of shares will, in the event of a no-deal or 'hard' Brexit, limit the 
proportionate number of shares held by or on behalf of non-EU shareholders," it said. The move will quicken the 
pace at which Ryanair's UK share base is reduced in the event of a no-deal.
Ryanair approved the share buyback only last month, saying it would run for up to 12 months. The move to allow 
block buybacks would not change the original (EURO)700m limit on the scheme, the airline said. The timing and 
actual number of shares repurchased will depend on market conditions, it added.
Ryanair said the move could "reduce the period" in which related measures to boost EU shareholdings in the 
company would be enforced.
The Dublin-based carrier has already warned UK investors that they will lose voting rights after a hard no-deal 
Brexit until Ryanair regains a 55 per cent EU majority of shareholders, something that could take as long as eight 
months.
Under measures passed by its board last March, UK shareholders will not have the right to attend, speak or vote at 
any general meeting of the company after a www.no-deal.UK nationals will not be allowed to buy Ryanair ordinary 
shares "with effect from hard Brexit day" - and when UK investors decide to sell shares in a no-deal they will be 
allowed to sell only to EU nationals.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, has said the airline could take four months to increase its EU 
shareholding above 50 per cent with another four months required to bring the level to 55 per cent. Only then would 
Ryanair restore voting rights.

Ryanair approved the share buyback only last month, saying it would run for up to 12 months. The move to allow 
block buybacks would not change the original (EURO)700m limit on the scheme, the airline said. The timing and 
actual number of shares repurchased will depend on market conditions, it added.
Ryanair said the move could "reduce the period" in which related measures to boost EU shareholdings in the 
company would be enforced.
The Dublin-based carrier has already warned UK investors that they will lose voting rights after a hard no-deal 
Brexit until Ryanair regains a 55 per cent EU majority of shareholders, something that could take as long as eight 
months.
Under measures passed by its board last March, UK shareholders will not have the right to attend, speak or vote at 
any general meeting of the company after a www.no-deal.UK nationals will not be allowed to buy Ryanair ordinary 
shares "with effect from hard Brexit day" - and when UK investors decide to sell shares in a no-deal they will be 
allowed to sell only to EU nationals.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, has said the airline could take four months to increase its EU 
shareholding above 50 per cent with another four months required to bring the level to 55 per cent. Only then would 
Ryanair restore voting rights.

Ryanair has ramped up efforts to keep the airline under majority EU ownership in a no-deal Brexit by triggering 
block purchases of shares from investors under a month-old (EURO)700m buyback scheme.
The Irish carrier's move comes amid anxiety about the rising risk of Britain crashing out of the bloc in the autumn as 
Boris Johnson, the favourite to succeed Theresa May as prime minister, pushes for a "do or die" Brexit in October 
even without a deal.
Jeremy Hunt, Mr Johnson's rival for the Conservative leadership, has also indicated that he too is willing to leave 
the EU with no agreement.
Ryanair fears a breach of its legal requirement to be majority-owned and controlled by European nationals after a 
no-deal as its share of EU shareholders would immediately drop to 45 per cent from 55 per cent without UK 
investors.
The question is one of the most complex facing airlines in the run-up to a possible no-deal, with doubt also cast 
over some carriers' supply chains for spare aircraft parts.
In a fresh bid to curtail the number of shares in the hands of non-Europeans, Ryanair yesterday rejigged the 
buyback scheme to allow block buybacks.

"Any such block repurchases from UK holders of shares will, in the event of a no-deal or 'hard' Brexit, limit the 
proportionate number of shares held by or on behalf of non-EU shareholders," it said. The move will quicken the 
pace at which Ryanair's UK share base is reduced in the event of a no-deal.

Low-cost airlines took off after the 1990s liberalisation of Europe's skies. Brexit has grounded integrationists' 
dreams. Dublin-based Ryanair is trimming accordingly. A (EURO)700m share buyback may be tweaked to reduce 
its UK shareholder base, it said yesterday. In a no-deal Brexit, that could make meeting EU ownership rules easier. 
It will not brighten shareholders' mood.
European air travel has hit serious turbulence. Overcapacity and a price war have eroded profits. Better performing 
long-haul operations have helped incumbent national carriers. They are fighting back.
Ryanair is concentrated on short haul. Its position at the top of European aviation may be at an end. Adding ballast 
is lossmaking Laudamotion, acquired recently. Ryanair's shares have underperformed Lufthansa and British 
Airways owner IAG for much of the past year. But they still trade at about 12.5 times forward earnings, a quarter 
higher than easyJet.
Brexit will intensify Ryanair's woes, especially if chaotic. Without UK shareholders, EU ownership would fall below 
the 50 per cent minimum. The (EURO)700m buyback will make scant difference, however. The sum amounts to just 
6 per cent of its market value. Perhaps the notoriously brusque company wants to show it cares about the comfort 
of shareholders, if not passengers? Yet UK shareholders still face losing voting rights.
A further threat is to EU traffic rights. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the industry assumes regulators would keep 
aeroplanes flying. The risk of disruption is significant. Market fragmentation will become a long-term headwind. A 
quarter of Ryanair's revenues are from the UK, where its margins are higher than elsewhere.
Ryanair /Brexit: open skies blues Twitter : @FTLex
Brexit also threatens to badly disrupt the UK and continental European economies. Ryanair's buyback is therefore 
merely a sop. "This is not a time when anybody else should be buying shares," boss Michael O'Leary admitted last 
month. He is right.

Ryanair seeks to limit UK share holding with buyback amendment

Ryanair amended the terms of a 700 million euro share buyback on Wednesday to allow block repurchases it said 
could limit the holdings of British shareholders and ensure it remains majority EU-owned after Brexit.
Ryanair triggered contingency plans in March to restrict the voting rights of British shareholders if the UK leaves the 
European Union without a deal on future relations or quits both the EU customs union and single market in a "hard" 
Brexit scenario.
The restrictions are aimed at ensuring Europe's largest low-cost carrier remains majority EU-owned to comply with 
its licensing and flight rights.
"Ryanair advises that it is amending the terms of the arrangements to allow for shares to be repurchased by way of 
block trades from EU holders of shares," the airline said in a statement on Wednesday.
"Any such block repurchases from UK holders will, in the event of a no-deal or "hard" Brexit, limit the proportionate 
number of shares held by or on behalf of non-EU shareholders and should therefore reduce the period that the 
resolutions announced on March 11 would need to remain in place."
Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorohan said in February that while the airline was 55 percent EU-owned, 
Britain-based shareholders controlled 20 percent of its stock. He told Reuters he expected half of those to 
redomicile to the EU in a no-deal or "hard" Brexit.
Ryanair announced the 700 million euro buyback last month, guiding that it expected to split it between 500 million 
euros of shares in underlying American Depositary Shares (ADS) and 200 million of ordinary shares, but that the 
board had discretion to revise this allocation.

It said on Wednesday that the split between ADR's and ordinary shares will be dependent on market conditions and 
legal and regulatory requirements. The programme is due to take nine to 12 months. (Reuters)

An airline may cite "extraordinary circumstances" in denying passengers compensation if a fuel leak on the runway 
causes a long delay, the top EU court said on Wednesday.
Passenger rights have become increasingly contested in Europe's crowded skies, and countries such as Germany 
have seen a sharp increase in complaints.
At issue is a case filed against Ryanair, which denied a passenger compensation of 250 euros (285 dollars) after a 
a flight from Italy to Belgium was delayed for four hours due to a fuel leak on the runway.
Under EU regulations, passengers may claim compensation after a delay of three hours, barring special 
circumstances.
In this case, it was aircraft fuel from another plane that had leaked on to the runway, causing a delay that "could not 
have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken within the meaning of that provision," the 
European Court of Justice (ECJ) wrote in a non-binding summary.
Such a case should be considered an extraordinary circumstance, the Luxembourg judges wrote.
The court took a similar line in April in a ruling concerning the budget airline Germanwings.
The judges concluded that passengers may be denied compensation for flight delays caused by a screw on the 
runway, if the carrier proves that it did everything possible to try to stick to the timetable - another example of a 
special circumstance.

IAG chief executive Willie Walsh expects further European airline bankruptcies in 2019 amid "stubbornly" high fuel 
prices and competitive pressures in what is likely to a "tough" year for the sector.
During a webcasted panel session at the ACI Europe annual congress in the Cypriot city of Limassol today, Walsh 
said that carriers without fuel hedges, especially those with "weak" balance sheets, were facing a "major problem".
@ACI_EUROPE
Walsh predicts that "there will be some M&A [merger and acquisition] activity" but adds: "When we talk about 
consolidation in Europe, do talk about it in the context of airlines disappearing as well. Unlike 20 years ago, I think, 
when an airline disappears it's rare to see that airline replaced."
He notes: "It's not always the case, but a lot of the capacity is now provided by airlines already in operation, which 
leaves very little space for somebody to try to come in and start up."
Ryanair chief commercial officer David O'Brien agreed. He says he expects a number of airline failures in the next 
six months in Europe, including, possibly, some "sizeable" carriers.
EasyJet chief commercial and strategy officer Robert Carey says there has as yet been little evidence of capacity 
leaving the market as a result of consolidation.
He suggest that "improvements" are still needed in Europe if it is to reach the same conditions as exist in the USA, 
where consolidation has created a "sustainable" market.
IAG chief predicts more airline failures in 'tough' 2019 IAG chief executive Willie Walsh expects further 
European airline bankruptcies in 2019 amid "stubbornly....
Overall, the airline panelists foresaw a weaker demand outlook in Europe, but detected opportunities still there for 
growth.
O'Brien describes the outlook as a "mixed bag", as uncertainty around Brexit dampens demand for air travel in the 
UK and has a knock-on effect on traffic volumes to Spain and the Mediterranean.
Walsh says demand in London is "good" and postulates, in reference to O'Brien's comments, that Brexit is perhaps 
impacting the rest of the UK more than the capital.
Aer Lingus has had a good performance in France, though Vueling's performance in that market was "weaker than 
expected", notes Walsh.
Overall the market has been "okay" in Europe, he says. A lot of capacity has been going into the market, leading to 
a "yield hit" in the first quarter, he adds.
Walsh and O'Brien both complain that Lufthansa is distorting the market in Germany and Austria. Walsh says that 
there is still demand in both countries but argues that the overcapacity which the German group has bemoaned is 
its own capacity, so in effect its airlines are "complaining about themselves".
Walsh says IAG is seeing "weakness" in Argentina and Brazil, where there are "clearly economic issues", while 
South Africa has been "weak". Europe overall has been "okay" and the demand in France and Spain robust.
Aegean Airlines chief executive Dimitris Gerogiannis says the Greek carrier is expecting a "softer" summer, with the 
market expected to "plateau" during the year. Overall, he expects the Greek market to grow by 1% in 2019.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) said pre-market Wednesday it has decided to amend the terms of its EUR700 million ($795.6 
million) share repurchase program to allow it to privately purchase shares held by UK investors and to ensure it 
remains majority EU-owned to comply with EU licensing and flight rights.
The Irish-based budget carrier said it will allow shares to be repurchased by way of block trades from EU 
shareholders. Such repurchases from UK shareholders will allow it to limit their holdings in case the UK leaves the 
EU without a deal on future relations or abandons both the EU customs union and single market in a "hard" Brexit 
scenario.

       Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) amended the terms of its share buy-back programme to allow for shares 
to be repurchased by way of block trades from EU holders of shares. The maximum consideration payable by the 
company with respect to underlying American Depositary shares remain unchanged at 700 million euros. 
 Under the amended terms of the arrangements, any block repurchases from UK holders will, in the event of a no-
deal or "hard" Brexit, limit the proportionate number of shares held by or on behalf of non-EU shareholders.

       U.K. stocks rose modestly on Wednesday as investors digested comments from Federal Reserve chairman 
Jerome Powell and looked ahead to the G20 meeting for directional cues. 
 The benchmark FTSE 100 was up 11 points or 0.15 percent at 7,433 after rising 0.1 percent the previous day.
 Royal Dutch Shell was up half a percent and BP Plc was rising 1 percent as oil prices jumped nearly 2 percent in 
the face of worries about U.S.-Iran relations and on data showing a large crude oil inventory draw.
 Wood Group (John) shares jumped 5.5 percent. The engineering and oilfield services provider said its performance 
in the first half was better than a year earlier.
 Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings gained 0.6 percent after amending the terms of its share buyback program. 
 Distribution and outsourcing Group Bunzl fell over 1 percent. The company said its first-half group revenue is 
expected to have increased by approximately 4 percent.

Ryanair has detailed plans to set up a unit in Malta, adding to its growing stable of airlines.
The Irish carrier will move six Malta-based Boeing 737s into start-up Malta Air and plans to grow the fleet based in 
the country to 10 aircraft within three years.
In addition, 200 crew will move to local Maltese contracts, and Ryanair says it plans to create 350 jobs over three 
years.
Ryanair says the investment will give it access to North Africa markets from Malta. The Maltese government had on 
9 June disclosed an outline of the plans, saying that the Ryanair initiative would help develop the island nation into 
a southern European transit hub.
“Malta Air will proudly fly the Maltese name and flag to over 60 destinations across Europe and North Africa as we 
look to grow our Maltese-based fleet, routes, traffic and jobs over the next three years,” states Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O’Leary.
The budget carrier will also add to its Maltese air operator’s certificate dozens of Ryanair aircraft currently based 
across France, Germany and Italy. The move will allow employees to pay income tax in those countries, rather than 
in Ireland, where the aircraft are currently registered.
“We look forward to working closely with the Maltese authorities over the coming years as we hope to add over 50 
more aircraft to the Maltese register,” adds O’Leary. Ryanair says it hopes to complete the investment in Malta Air 
by the end of June.
Malta Air is set to join Buzz, Laudamotion, Ryanair UK and the principal Ryanair operation within the group. Ryanair 
had previously set up an IAG-style structure earlier this year to manage its operating units.

Are we there yet? European airline shareholders will empathise with overtired infants trapped in economy on 
delayed flights. Another profit warning by Lufthansa pushed its shares 11 per cent lower yesterday.
Other European airlines had similar falls. Lufthansa's market value has dropped almost half since 2018. Yet the end 
of the journey is still not in sight.
Lufthansa blamed fierce competition, especially in its German and Austrian home markets. Eurowings, its budget 
airline that accounts for 12 per cent of revenues, racked up losses. As in European banking, fragmentation and 
overcapacity have eroded profits in European short-haul airlines. Shares in IAG, owner of British Airways, Ryanair, 
and easyJet as well as Lufthansa have underperformed sickly European bank stocks over the past year.
Airlines have sought to restrain supply. Growth in European short-haul capacity should fall below 3 per cent in the 
third quarter, the lowest for four years, Barclays reckons. Outright cuts may be needed. Lufthansa's warning 
indicates that demand has fallen short of expectations. Germany's economy has stalled. Brexit will dog European 
airlines at least until the winter.
Before then, action on capacity is unlikely. Bookings are already in place. Meanwhile, price wars will intensify. 
Lufthansa says that it will "vigorously defend" market shares. That was a riposte to Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary's 
promise of "painful" price cuts to drive out rivals.

Are we there yet? European airline shareholders will empathise with overtired infants trapped in economy on 
delayed flights. Another profit warning by Lufthansa pushed its shares 11 per cent lower yesterday.
Other European airlines had similar falls. Lufthansa's market value has dropped almost half since 2018. Yet the end 
of the journey is still not in sight.
Lufthansa blamed fierce competition, especially in its German and Austrian home markets. Eurowings, its budget 
airline that accounts for 12 per cent of revenues, racked up losses. As in European banking, fragmentation and 
overcapacity have eroded profits in European short-haul airlines. Shares in IAG, owner of British Airways, Ryanair, 
and easyJet as well as Lufthansa have underperformed sickly European bank stocks over the past year.
Airlines have sought to restrain supply. Growth in European short-haul capacity should fall below 3 per cent in the 
third quarter, the lowest for four years, Barclays reckons. Outright cuts may be needed. Lufthansa's warning 
indicates that demand has fallen short of expectations. Germany's economy has stalled. Brexit will dog European 
airlines at least until the winter.
Before then, action on capacity is unlikely. Bookings are already in place. Meanwhile, price wars will intensify. 
Lufthansa says that it will "vigorously defend" market shares. That was a riposte to Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary's 
promise of "painful" price cuts to drive out rivals.

Lufthansa lowers profit forecast as short-haul woes mount JANINA CONBOYE - LONDON Shares in Lufthansa 
dropped 12 per cent and weighed on its rivals after the German airline lowered its profit outlook for the second time 
this year. Despite strong business on transatlantic and Asian routes, the airline's European short-haul market, 
which includes its low-cost airline Eurowings, continues to face pressure from other carriers as they battle to win 
passengers. There is mounting evidence that conditions in the European airline industry are worsening after several 
carriers warned they were facing tough trading conditions. 
Ryanair and easyJet both issued profit warnings this year. Lufthansa expects its margin on adjusted earnings 
before interest and tax (ebit) to be between 5.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent, down from a previously predicted 6.5 per 
cent to 8 per cent. It said this would produce an adjusted ebit figure of (EURO)2bn to (EURO)2.4bn. This also 
factors in a (EURO)550m increase in fuel costs, despite a recent decline in the oil price. The profit warning dragged 
down Europe's other big airlines. Ryanair shares fell 6 per cent, easyJet was down 5 per cent and Air France 
slipped 5 per 'Company [is] seemingly unable to know where to focus its capital - and where not to' cent. Adrian 
Yanoshik, analyst at Berenberg, said that "primarily it's a shorthaul average fare pricing issue that's spooked 
people", reflecting overcapacity in the the European short-haul market. He also said that as Europe's largest airline, 
Lufthansa was a "canary in a coal mine", driving sentiment in the sector. At Eurowings, revenues are expected to 
decline significantly in the second quarter. For the full year, Lufthansa forecast a decrease at a mid-single-digit rate 
citing that "the progress in streamlining the Eurowings cost base is also slower than expected". "The Eurowings 
management has resolved upon further turnround measures which it will present shortly," Lufthansa said. But 
according to Mr Yanoshik the company has not as yet "offered up any specifics". The airline said it expected the 
Lufthansa lowers profit forecast as short-haul woes mount
European market to remain challenging for the remainder of the year. But RBC Capital Markets said in a note that it 
remained "astonished" that Lufthansa continues to vigorously defend its market share, when "it is increasingly clear 
to us it seems to have neither the cost base nor product/price mix to do so without destroying shareholder value". 
RBC sees little relief for the shares until Lufthansa "rethinks this value-destructive strategy". RBC also noted that it 
found it hard to blame Eurowings' costs on external factors saying that "financial control/management issues are 
now compounding the impact of a company seemingly unable to know where to focus its capital - and where not 
to". Lufthansa Cargo has also been hit by weaker demand between Europe and Asia and expects flat revenue in 
2019. Analysts at Bernstein noted that the decline in air freight demand raised more worries as it could foreshadow 
a slower business environment. Lufthansa made an adjusted loss of (EURO)336m before interest and tax in the 
first three months of 2019, compared with an adjusted profit of (EURO)52m in same quarter last year. See Lex

 Stock prices in London opened higher on Monday, with airlines weighing on the FTSE 100 after a profit warning by 
Germany's Lufthansa, while in the FTSE 250, Kier Group's woes continued as the construction firm axed its 
dividend. 
The FTSE 100 was up just 2.10 points at 7,347.88. The FTSE 250 was up 37.51 points, or 0.2%, at 19,155.85. The 
AIM All-Share was up 1.98 points, or 0.2%, at 939.19.
The Cboe UK 100 index was up 0.1% at 12,470.39. The Cboe UK 250 was up 0.1% at 17,158.89, and the Cboe UK 
Small Companies was flat at 11,670.12.
In European equities, the CAC 40 in Paris was flat and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was up 0.1%.
In the FTSE 100, Severn Trent was up 1.0% after Macquarie started coverage on the water company with an 
Outperform rating. 
The Australian bank initiated fellow utility stocks National Grid and United Utilities at Outperform. National Grid and 
United Utilities were up 0.4% and 0.3% respectively. 
At the other end of the large cap index, airlines were the worst performers after German carrier Lufthansa lowered 
its profit outlook for 2019, amid market over capacity and intense competition from low-cost carriers in Europe.
Budget airline easyJet and British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group were down 3.3% and 
3.1%, respectively. Midcap peer Wizz Air was down 4.6% and Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings was down 4.2%. 
Lufthansa blamed "price deterioration in Europe caused by market-wide overcapacities and aggressively growing 
low cost competitors are putting pressure on yields in the European short-haul market".
The German airline said it now expects adjusted earnings before interest and tax of EUR2.0 billion to EUR2.4 billion 
in 2019, on the basis of low-single-digit revenue growth. In 2018, Lufthansa reported adjusted Ebit of EUR2.8 
billion, down from EUR3.0 billion in 2017.

It said its network airlines are expected to have an adjusted Ebit margin of between 7% and 9%, with budget carrier 
Eurowings suffering an adjusted Ebit margin of negative 4% to negative 6%.
British American Tobacco was down 1.6% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the Dunhill and Lucky Strike cigarette 
maker to Underweight from Equal Weight. 
In the FTSE 250, Babcock International was up 3.7% after the defence contractor confirmed it rejected in January 
an approach from outsourcer Serco Group.
The proposal was unsolicited and "highly preliminary", Babcock said, and involved an all-share merger. No further 
proposal has been received since January. The Sunday Times had reported Serco made at least two attempts to 
merge with Babcock. 
Serco shares were flat. 
At the bottom of the midcap index, Kier Group was down 6.6%. The troubled construction firm suspended dividend 
payments and earmarked several non-core business for disposal as it looks to get its balance sheet under control.
Kier has put up for sale Kier Living, its housebuilding business, saying that despite being a strong business it would 
require significant funding to keep growing. So far there have been "a number" of expressions of interest.
Kier Property also has been put up for sale, with the investment required likewise "incompatible" with Kier's capital 
requirements, and Kier also will be quitting the Management and Environmental Services businesses.
Kier has suspended dividend payments for its year ending June, and the following financial year. At the interim 
stage, Kier slashed its first half dividend 79% to 4.9 pence a share. 
The stock is down 71% so far in 2019. Kier will be demoted from the FTSE 250 when the FTSE Russell index 
review changes come into effect next Monday. 
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed flat. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed up 0.2%, while the Hang 
Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.5%.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2577 Monday, down from USD1.2604 at the London equities close Friday.
The British Chamber of Commerce cut its UK growth forecasts for the next two years, it revealed Monday, despite a 
more positive outlook on 2019.
For 2020, the BCC has cut its growth forecast to 1.0% from 1.3%, and for 2021 to 1.2% from 1.4%. But for 2019, 
the BCC has upgraded its UK growth estimate to 1.3% from 1.2%, mainly due to "exceptionally rapid" stockbuilding 
early in 2019, as manufacturers prepared for the intended end-March Brexit.
"However, the immediate boost to UK GDP is forecast to come at the cost of more subdued growth in 2020 and 
2021 as the unwinding of historically-high inventory levels, coupled with weaker business investment, weigh on 
economic activity," said the BCC.
The economic events calendar has Ireland first-quarter GDP data at 1100 BST.

Local labour laws apply to Ryanair employees says Belgian court
Local labour laws apply to Ryanair employees says Belgian court

Belgium's labour laws can apply to Ryanair employees based in the country, a local court ruled on Friday, in a case 
that could set a precedent elsewhere in Europe and upholds a 2018 agreement reached between the airline and 
Belgian unions.
A series of strikes in 2018 prompted the Irish airline to agree to apply Belgian law to cabin crew and pilots based in 
the country. The union and airline finished negotiations, including on salary increases, last month.
The ruling at the Mons labour court, under which employees can decide whether to be covered by Belgian or Irish 
labour laws, reinforces the agreement and will prevent the airline from taking disputes to court in Ireland, said Yves 
Lambot, a representative of the CNE union.
"This is a great union victory for all of Europe," he said after the ruling. "It will allow all workers, be they Belgian or 
from other European countries, to be able to consult the court they consider the best."
Ryanair said in a statement the ruling only recognised the agreement it had made with Belgian unions to apply 
Belgian labour laws for those on Belgian contracts.
"This decision by the Mons Court will have no effect, and set no precedent since it only recognises the contractual 
arrangements already agreed last year by Ryanair with its crews in Belgium," the statement said.
The case was first brought forward in 2011 by six former employees of Ryanair and Crewlink, a recruitment agency 
for Ryanair, based at Charleroi airport in Belgium.
Local labour laws apply to Ryanair employees says Belgian court
The former employees will return to court in February next year to seek compensation for previously not being 
treated as if covered by Belgian labour laws. (Reuters)

Lufthansa shares slip after profit warning

Lufthansa's shares dropped Monday more than 12 per cent from Friday's price after the Frankfurt-based airline 
issued a profit warning.
Operating profit is now forecast to come in at between 2.0 and 2.4 billion euros (2.2 - 2.7 billion dollars), down from 
the previous estimate of between 2.4 and 3 billion euros.
Management is seeking to build up reserves of 340 million euros to cover increased tax payments over recent years 
following a new ruling by the Federal Finance Court.
According to a weekend statement by the company, the long-haul business continues to be profitable. But 
Lufthansa's budget subsidiary, Eurowings, is thought likely to make a loss in the current year.
Eurowings, which absorbed large parts of Air Berlin following its bankruptcy, is to take additional cost-cutting 
measures, which will be announced shortly.
The subsidiary is feeling the heat from competitors Ryanair and Easyjet. Lufthansa also pointed to a rise in fuel 
costs.
Lufthansa's airfreight unit, Lufthansa Cargo, is also not performing as expected. It has grounded three older 
machines and is predicting stagnant turnover for the year.

Luxair is seeking potential pilots to join its cadet scheme with an offer of upfront funding for the scheme.
The Luxembourg-based carrier is looking for recruits to start flight training in October, touting a “long-term career 
perspective in a stable but growing airline”.
Cadets will not have to pay for their 20-month training, Luxair says in a post on its careers website. Instead, once 
they are flying as a first officer for Luxair, the airline will retain a portion of their salary to cover the cost.
Integrated pilot training courses can cost students around 90,000 or as much as £100,000 at schools in the UK, so 
the offer could encourage cadets who are otherwise unable to raise such funds upfront.
Those high costs of training have often been cited as one of the reasons behind a shortage of pilots around the 
world. The tightening in the labour market has prompted airlines to look at how they secure a pipeline of flight crew.
For example, Air France in January last year launched its first fully-funded ab initio training scheme in nine years. It 
recruited 110 pilots through that process and in October it announced a second round of recruitment, saying it was 
hoping to train one hundred new pilots by 2020.
Air Baltic has also launched its own pilot academy as a way of securing crew as it grows its network and fleet. The 
academy is currently accepting applicants, some of whom will be guaranteed a job with Air Baltic after they 
completed the selection process, and says it will help cadets to apply for a bank loan, although does not provide 
any funding itself. Meanwhile, Qantas is also offering scholarships for its new pilot academy, set to open later this 
year.
New Luxair scheme latest in moves to tackle pilot shortage Luxair is seeking potential pilots to join its cadet 
scheme with an offer of upfront funding for the ....
In a nod to gender inequality in the industry, where currently only around 6% of commercial pilots are female, 
training provider L3 was overwhelmed with applications after it offered female-only scholarships late last year to 
cover around one-third of the cost of its ATPL programme.
In a bid to boost recruitment and keep crews, Ryanair also last year cut the price for type ratings for newly qualified 
pilots seeking their first airline job. The course price has been cut from almost 30,000 down to 5,000, although that 
discount is dependent on pilots staying with the company for five years.
Applications for the Luxair scheme are open until the end of June. Successful candidates will receive training at the 
RWL Flight Academy in Moenchen-Gladbach in Germany.

Scotland puts Glasgow Prestwick Airport up for sale
Scotland puts Glasgow Prestwick Airport up for sale

Highlight: The Scottish Government has decided to sell Glasgow Prestwick Airport and will place an advertisement 
in the Official Journal of the European Union, inviting expressions of interest in the business.
Body
In November 2013, the government took ownership of the airport for £1 after heavy losses threatened closure of the 
Prestwick Airport, which was considered a strategic economic asset, particularly for Ayrshire. The public ownership 
of the airport has protected jobs directly and indirectly linked to the airport, in addition to safeguarding a strategic 
asset. The government said that the preferred bidder will be required to give a commitment to maintain aviation 
operations and maximise the employment potential associated with the business. 
It will also have significant investment capabilities, be capable of operating and managing an airport, and have the 
ability to develop aviation services. Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Michael 
Matheson said: "Since the Scottish Government bought Glasgow Prestwick Airport in 2013, we have been clear 
that it is our intention to return the business to the private sector when the time is right. "The senior management 
team at the airport has continued to engage with potential buyers and investors to discuss proposals for developing 
the business under new ownership. "Good progress continues to be made by the airport to increase revenue, 
deliver operating efficiencies and pursue exciting opportunities for the future, including Spaceport." Matheson said 
that any expressions of interest would be considered carefully before taking any decision on divesting the 
government's shareholding in the airport or any part of the business. Transport Scotland said that potential buyers 
have not yet been identified. A Scottish Government spokesperson said: "There have been a number of businesses 
and individuals interested in buying the airport since 2013. "In light of that, we want to test the market and this 
process allows potential buyers to submit a detailed proposal." The Ayrshire airport is said to have taken on £40m 
of Scottish Government loans, which will need to be paid back. Even though Ryanair is Prestwick's only passenger 
airline, the airport's other income is from cargo and military flights, and other operations.

Irish airline Ryanair to establish subsidiary in Malta

Highlight: Irish low-cost airline Ryanair has agreed to establish a subsidiary in Malta to expand its presence on the 
island and improve access to North Africa.
Body
The Irish airline operates a number of subsidiaries, including Austrian and Polish airlines Laudamotion and Ryanair 
Buzz. The Maltese Government said that it is in talks withÂ Ryanair about setting up the subsidiary and the Irish 
firm announced that it will acquire Malta Air to establish the subsidiary. 
The airline said that it will shift the six aircraft currently operating in the country to the subsidiary, according to 
Reuters. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement: "Malta Air will proudly fly the Maltese name and flag as 
we look to grow our Malta-based fleet, routes, traffic and jobs over the next three years." The European low-cost 
airline said that it will increase its Maltese fleet to ten aircraft within three years and rebrand them as Malta Air for 
operations in 2020. In addition, Ryanair said that it will move more than 50 planes based in France, Italy and 
Germany onto the Maltese register, enabling crews to pay income tax locally instead of in Ireland. In a Facebook 
post, Malta's Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi said that the airline will include a 'golden share', a mechanism under 
which the government approval is required for disposal, share issue or takeover. The minister said that the airline 
will also establish hangar facilities for repair and maintenance operations in Malta. Mizzi affirmed that there will not 
be an impact on state-owned Air Malta, as the two airlines will offer different but complementary services. According 
to Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson, Ryanair's move to add another brand will not come as a surprise and that 
doing so in Malta is likely due to the cost and/or tax benefits for Ryanair.

RYANAIR agreed yesterday to establish a Malta-based carrier to grow its presence on the island and access to 
North Africa, adding another subsidiary to its group of airlines.
Ryanair has been moving to a structure similar to that of British Airways-owner IAG by operating an increasing 
number of subsidiaries, including Austrian and Polish airlines Laudamotion and Ryanair Buzz, as well as its main 
Dublinbased Ryanair.
After the Maltese government said it was in advanced talks with Ryanair about setting up the subsidiary, the Irish 
airline announced it would do so through the purchase of Maltese startup Malta Air, into which it will move its six 
aircraft currently based in the country.
"Malta Air will proudly fly the Maltese name and flag," Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
Europe's largest low-cost airline said it planned to increase its fleet on the island to 10 aircraft within three years 
and rebrand them as Malta Air for summer 2020.

Body
Budget airline Ryanair signed a deal with the Maltese government on Tuesday to buy Malta Air, a Maltese start-up, 
expanding its presence on the Mediterranean island.
Malta Air will operate out of Malta using a fleet of six aircraft, increasing to 10 over the next three years. 
The deal will see Ryanair aircraft from France, Italy and Germany move to the Maltese aircraft register.
The investment will allow Ryanair to grow its already sizeable presence in Malta, and access non-EU markets like 
North Africa from Malta, according to a statement.
The deal was signed in Valletta between Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and Maltese government officials, in the 
presence of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. 
Muscat said Malta Air will complement the services of Air Malta, the country's flagship carrier.
"Despite the scaremongering, Air Malta has not just survived but registered its first surplus in two decades. 
Welcome Malta Air and long live Air Malta," Muscat told reporters.
Last month, Ryanair announced that its annual net profit had slumped by almost one third as overcapacity in the 
European short-haul sector caused it to cut ticket prices.

add another ten aircraft to its Malta-based register within three years' time. The company has also announced that it

Ryanair has detailed plans to set up a unit in Malta, adding to its growing stable of airlines.
The Irish carrier will move six Malta-based Boeing 737s into start-up Malta Air and plans to grow the fleet based in 
the country to 10 aircraft within three years.
In addition, 200 crew will move to local Maltese contracts, and Ryanair says it plans to create 350 jobs over three 
years.
Ryanair says the investment will give it access to North Africa markets from Malta. The Maltese government had on 
9 June disclosed an outline of the plans saying that the Ryanair initiative would help develop the island nation into a 
southern European transit hub.
"Malta Air will proudly fly the Maltese name and flag to over 60 destinations across Europe and North Africa as we 
look to grow our Maltese-based fleet, routes, traffic and jobs over the next three years," states Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary.
The budget carrier will also add to its Maltese air operator's certificate (AOC) dozens of Ryanair aircraft currently 
based across France, Germany and Italy. The move will allow employees to pay income tax in those countries, 
rather than in Ireland, where the aircraft are currently registered.
"We look forward to working closely with the Maltese authorities over the coming years as we hope to add over 50 
more aircraft to the Maltese register," adds O'Leary.
Ryanair says it hopes to complete the investment in Malta Air by the end of June.
Malta Air will join Buzz, Lauda, Ryanair UK and the main Ryanair operation within the group. Ryanair had set up an 
IAG-style structure earlier this year to manage its operating units.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) said Tuesday that it has agreed to purchase Maltese startup airline Malta Air, into 
which it will move and grow its Malta-based fleet of six Boeing (BA) 737 aircraft.
The investment in Malta Air will allow Ryanair to grow its presence in Malta, in which it has 3 million customers per 
year, and access non-EU markets such as North Africa.
The completion of the purchase is expected by the end of June, after which Ryanair will switch six Malta-based 
aircraft worth over $600 million onto the Maltese register and move 200 Malta-based crew onto local contracts. The 
company is also looking to brand its Malta-based fleet in Malta Air colors for summer 2020, and increase its Malta-
based fleet to 10 aircraft within three years and create more than 350 jobs.
The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.

Ryanair's British pilots have signalled strong support for industrial action over pay and conditions in an indicative 
ballot carried out by the BALPA trade union, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
The memo, sent to union members on Monday, said 90% of pilots balloted supported the non-binding call for 
industrial action, though it did not say how many pilots took part.
BALPA is due to hold talks with Ryanair on Tuesday, the memo said. BALPA and Ryanair did not immediately 
respond to requests for comment.
Ryanair suffered a series of damaging strikes last year after the airline bowed to pressure in late 2017 to recognise 
unions for the first time. That contributed to the weakest annual profit in four years in figures reported last month.
Europe's largest budget airline has managed to quell disputes by reaching agreements with many unions in Europe 
on pay and allowances, but has yet to move beyond the recognition agreement it struck with Britain's BALPA union 
almost 18 months ago.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in May he did not expect disruption this summer due to labour 
issues, but that it could not be completely ruled out. (Reuters)

Budget airline Ryanair has for the first time published monthly figures for its carbon dioxide emissions, in the face of 
growing pressure on the industry to reduce its environmental impact.
Ryanair's figures showed it emitted 1.2m tonnes of carbon dioxide in May, roughly the same amount that New York 
City produces in a week.
The figures, which represent the first time a European airline has published monthly CO2 data, came as Ryanair 
faced mounting pressure from consumers and environmental groups over its emissions.
Recent data from the European emissions trading scheme revealed it as one of the scheme's top 10 carbon 
emitters in Europe.
Ryanair said that, despite the large headline figure, its emissions were lower on a per person per kilometre basis 
than most other airlines. Ryanair flights are almost always full and have no business or first class, making them 
more carbon-efficient than some rivals.
Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer, said the airline wanted to be Europe's "greenest" and planned to 
invest more $20bn in a new fleet of Boeing 737s that would be more efficient. Over the past decade, the company 
has reduced its emissions per passenger/per kilometre by 18 per cent, he pointed out.
Ryanair issues its first monthly emissions data Airlines
However, emissions trading data showed that Ryanair's total emissions had been rising as it expands, outstripping 
gains from better efficiency. Andrew Murphy, aviation manager at Transport & Environment, an environmental 
group based in Brussels, said the publication of monthly CO2 data by Ryanair would "throw down the gauntlet" to 
other airlines.
"Aviation is the fastest growing source of emissions in Europe," he said. "If we leave it unchecked, it will undo a lot 
of the progress that we are making in other sectors."
Airlines are under growing pressure to reduce their climate impact, a difficult task because there are still no viable 
alternatives to jet-fuelled aircraft.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Wednesday.----------COMPANIES----------BT Group said it will close 
around 270 offices as it looks to consolidate its operations into just 30 locations across the country. The FTSE 100-
listed telecommunications firm was making the move as part of its "Better Workplace" programme announced in 
May 2018. Ultimately, this will see the former state-owned monopoly consolidate its more than 300 current locations 
to just around 30. The programme is part of a broader plan to cut as many as 13,000 back office and middle 
management jobs and a three-year cost reduction of GBP1.5 billion. These consolidated sites will contain "modern, 
future-fit buildings, including corporate offices, contact centres and specialist sites", the firm explained. The process 
is expected to be completed by 2023. ----------Provident Financial said the collapse of Non-Standard Finance's 
hostile GBP1.1 billion takeover for the company was "in the best interest of shareholders". Responding to a 
statement from lender NSF, stating that it would "lapse" the offer after discussions with the UK regulators, Provident 
said it "greatly regrets the unnecessary distraction, cost and impact of the uncertainty" caused by the bid. 
NFS's bid for its bigger London-listed home credit rival collapsed after the UK financial regulator blocked the deal 
on Tuesday. NSF said it would "lapse" the offer following discussions with the regulatory authorities as it had 
received a low level of acceptances by Wednesday's deadline to declare the offer bid wholly unconditional. As at 
Wednesday, NFS had received acceptances from around 54% of Provident investors. ----------Aviva said Chief 
Financial Officer Tom Stoddard will step down from his role and from the FTSE 100 insurer's board from the end of 
June. Stoddard - CFO since 2014 - will be replaced by Aviva UK Insurance CFO Jason Windsor on an interim 
basis, with Stoddard remaining at Aviva until the end of 2019 in order to "support an orderly transition." Windsor has 
been at Aviva since 2010 and has "extensive" experience of the firm after serving in a number of different senior 
roles. ----------Ryanair Holdings said its traffic rose 13% in May as the company carried 14.1 million passengers in 
the month. In the same month of 2018, the Irish budget airline transported 12.5 million passengers. Excluding the 
contribution of Austrian airline Lauda, which Ryanair acquired in December, the airline's traffic was up 8% to 13.5 
million customers. On a rolling annual basis, Ryanair's traffic was up 10% in May to 144.9 million passengers from 
132.1 million a year prior. In May, Ryanair operated almost 78,000 scheduled flights. ----------Workspace Group said 
it delivered "impressive" growth in its most recently ended financial year, on the back of which it increased its 
dividend. The office space provider said its pretax profit declined by 19% in the year to the end of March to 
GBP137.3 million from GBP170.4 million reported a year ago, due to reduced income from disposals and lower 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: BT To Close Offices In Over 270 UK Locations
uplift in property valuation. Trading profit, however, rose by 19% to GBP72.4 million from GBP60.7 million year-on-
year. The trading profit is net rental income, less administrative expenses and net finance costs. The company 
declared a final dividend of 22.26 pence a share, taking the total payout for the year to 32.87p, up 20% from 27.39p 
paid the year before. ----------MARKETS----------London shares were higher following a strong close in the US 
overnight after dovish comments from the Federal Reserve. In the FTSE 250, Provident was the best performer, up 
17%. The pound was up against the dollar following positive UK services PMI data. Wall Street was pointed to a 
higher open. ----------FTSE 100: up 0.5% at 7,252.08FTSE 250: up 0.8% at 19,162.71AIM ALL-SHARE: up 0.3% at

 Stock prices in London are set to open higher on Wednesday, following onfrom sharp gains seen on Wall Street 
after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested the US central bank could lower interest rates.
In London, Non-Standard Finance's hostile takeover of larger doorstep lending rival Provident Financial lapsed. 
FTSE 100-listed Aviva's chief financial officer has decided to step down, while Workspace reported a sharp rise in 
rental income. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 is set to open 7.01 points higher at 7,221.30. The blue chip index closed up 29.49 
points, or 0.4%, at 7,214.29 on Tuesday.
Non-Standard Finance's hostile GBP1.1 billion takeover for Provident Financial collapsed after the UK financial 
regulator blocked the deal on Tuesday.
Non-Standard Finance said it would "lapse" the offer following discussions with regulatory authorities as it had 
received a low level of acceptances by Wednesday deadline to declare the offer bid wholly unconditional. As at 
Wednesday, Non-Standard Finance had received acceptances from around 54% of Provident investors. 
Non-Standard Finance explained that while it remains appropriately capitalised, due to the low level of acceptances 
received, "the enlarged Non-Standard Finance group would not have sufficient regulatory capital on a consolidated 
basis at completion due to the expected level of minority interests at that point".
John van Kuffeler, Non-Standard Finance's group chief executive said: "I am very disappointed that despite our 
best efforts customers, employees and shareholders will not now benefit from our transformation plan to build a 
brighter future by combining Provident with Non-Standard Finance."
Aviva said CFO Tom Stoddard will be stepping down at the end of June. Aviva said Stoddard will remain with the 
company until the end of 2019 to "support an orderly transition". 
Current Aviva UK Insurance CFO Jason Windsor has been appointed interim CFO for the group.

Ryanair said its May traffic was up 13% year-on-year to 14.1 million customers. The budget airline operated 78,000 
scheduled flights in May. 
Office space rental firm Workspace saw a sharp fall in pretax profit in financial 2019 due to a lower year-on-year 
valuation increase and lower disposals profits compared to the year before. 
In the twelve months to March 31, Workspace reported pretax profit of GBP137.3 million, down from GBP170.4 
million. The company's trading profit increased 19%, however, to GBP72.4 million.
Workspace hiked its full year dividend 20% to 32.87 pence.
Card Factory said its first-quarter total sales were up 6.4% on a year before, with like-for-like sales in the three 
months to April 30 up 2.3%.
Card Factory said its performance in the first quarter "represents an encouraging start to the year". The company's 
expectations for the full year remain unchanged.
Go-Ahead said it has appointed Elodie Brian as chief financial officer on a permanent basis. Brian has been the 
firm's interim CFO since December. 
Speaking at the motoring association's AGM, AA said its trading in the period is in line with expectations and 
remains "well positioned" to meet its medium-term growth targets to financial 2023. AA also said it is "well 
positioned" to see Ebitda growth in financial 2020.
AA's financial year ends January 31.
Fed Chair Powell pledged the central bank will take appropriate actions to sustain the US economic expansion. 
Powell mentioned recent developments involving trade negotiations and other matters in opening remarks at a 
Chicago Fed conference on Tuesday, acknowledging that the Fed does not know how or when these issues will be 
resolved.
"We are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the US economic outlook and, as always, we 
will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2% 
objective," Powell said.
The rest of Powell's speech focused on longer-run issues, but the Fed chief's initial comments generated optimism 
about a potential interest rate cut and spurred a rally on Wall Street.
Powell's comments come after St Louis Fed President James Bullard suggested in a speech on Monday that an 
interest rate cut "may be warranted soon" due in part to escalating global trade tensions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ending up 2.1%, the S&P 500 up 2.1% and Nasdaq Composite up 2.7%.
In Asia on Wednesday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 closed up 1.8%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.1%, 
and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.5%.
Sterling was quoted at USD1.2706 early Wednesday, higher than USD1.2675 at the London equities close on 
Wednesday.
US President Donald Trump on Tuesday promised a "phenomenal" trade deal between the UK and US on his 
second day of a three-day state visit to the UK. "As the UK makes preparations to exit the EU, the US is committed 
to a phenomenal trade deal between the US and the UK," Trump said. "There is tremendous potential in that trade 
deal, I say probably two and even three times what we're doing right now."
The economic events calendar on Wednesday has Markit services PMI readings from France, Germany, the 
Eurozone and the UK at 0850 BST, 0855 BST, 0900 BST and 0930 BST, respectively.

Later in the day, there is Eurozone producer price index at 1000 BST and US Markit PMI reading at 1445 BST.
Already out, China's private sector activity growth moderated to a three-month low in May partly driven by softer 
rise in services activity, survey results published by IHS Markit revealed.
The Caixin composite output index fell to 51.5 in May from 52.7 in April. Nonetheless, the score remained above 
50.0 for the thirty-ninth consecutive month, suggesting continuing expansion in the sector.
The services Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to a 3-month low of 52.7 in May from 54.5 in April. However, the 
score was consistent with a robust rise in output amid firm client demand.

Jun 04, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A Ryanair 
passenger claimed that her partner was left with serious burns and blisters after anattendant accidentally spilled 
scalding hot water on him on a flight from Faro, Portugal, to Glasgow, Scotland. Although the incident took place on 
May 20, Tonina Ciantar only recently opened up about the ordeal that her partner, Thomas McNab, 49, had to go 
through."We had ordered two paninis and two hot chocolates shortly after take-off. 
The air hostess had the trolley next to Thomas and, next thing I knew, he jumped up and was screaming he was 
burning. About four of five cups were scattered on the floor and he was screaming that boiling water had gone down 
the front of his trousers and on to his feet. He stood up and ran to the bathroom to get the shoes off and try and get 
some cold water on them,' Ciantar said, Daily Record reported[1].She added that after the accidental spill, the flight 
attendant failed to administer the necessary first aid, and a result, the blisters and burns that her partner suffered 
just got worse. At one point, he even went into shock.'The flight attendant didn't even offer to get emergency 
assistance or move our seat so Thomas could stretch his legs out,' Ciantar said. "She actually made a comment 
about Thomas causing himself embarrassment by getting an ambulance. At one point he started shivering and 
saying he was cold. I panicked and bought some chocolate for him to try and boost his blood sugar and she actually 
charged us for it. The crew member who dropped the water was nowhere to be seen after it happened." In this 
representational photo, a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 aircraft lands at Barcelona's 'El Prat' airport, Sept. 28, 2018. 
Photo: Pau Barrena/AFP/Getty Images Although the couple had requested an ambulance at the tarmac whenthey 
landed, only the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service were available at the time. McNab was checked out by the 
paramedics who advised him to get admitted to a hospital without delay. He was treated for severe burns at the 
hospital."They submerged his feet in cold water and wrapped them in bandages, like they should have done on the 
plane," she said."I understand accidents happen, but the treatment by staff in the aftermath was shocking. It could 
easily have been a child or an elderly person. Luckily, Thomas is a big guy who was able to endure the pain and not 
make a fuss."A Ryanair spokesperson said their team had reached out to the customer in questionregarding the 
alleged incident and were 'looking for further information but has yet to receive a response. We will not be making 
further comment while the investigation continues.' [ 1]: https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ryanair-

Europe's stock market watchdog had wanted trading in top UK stocks by EU fund managers switched to EU venues 
in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But London is a far bigger market. The watchdog has backed down, but EU 
companies traded heavily in London could still be ensnared.
Hear a bugle sounding a retreat? The threat of a no-deal Brexit has put UK and EU stock market regulators on 
battle stations.
In March, the European Securities and Markets Authority warned that EU fund managers would have to use 
exchanges on the continent - rather than London venues - to trade 14 important London-listed stocks.
Yesterday, it admitted defeat and tore up the plan. That was positive for investors. They may still suffer collateral 
damage in a Brussels/London stand-off.
Esma's retreat recognised London's importance as a global market. EU asset managers wanted to trade there for 
deepest liquidity and best prices. They could have traded the 14 stocks on EU venues. The idea, however, of a 
German fund manager having to buy Vodafone shares in Berlin was silly.
The battle is not over. Esma still wants shares in selected companies from the remaining 27 EU countries traded on 
EU venues, even if they are listed in London or it is the most liquid market. IAG, the airline business registered in 
Spain, and Ireland's Ryanair would be ensnared.
European shares/Brexit: exchanges of fire Twitter : @FTLex
The UK's Financial Conduct Authority has not said how it might retaliate. One option would be to force UK asset 
managers to trade EU companies' shares only in London. That would hit EU venues - and further fragment 
European markets.
London regulators should hold fire.
Both sides are mutually dependent. EU companies benefit from being able to raise funds in the UK. London's 
openness boosts its international standing. Liquidity begets liquidity. An orderly Brexit might yet be possible, 
allowing a deal on share trading.
London would like an "equivalence" regime - EU recognition of its rules. That would be politically difficult for 
Brussels, implying EU benefits can be had without membership obligations.
Switzerland - outside the EU - may lose stock market equivalence if it does not sign up to new trading 
arrangements. Nevertheless, if Brexit happens, a peace deal that benefits shareholders would benefit the EU and 
London too.

Things were looking up this month as Paypoint announced profit grew two per cent year-on-year, and Jefferies 
analysts think this gives investors a reason to cash in. The store payment company has seen shares rise nearly 40 
per cent already this year, and this could keep rising, with revenue expected to be the "key profit driver". But, they 
added, "we also increase full-year 2020 net debt to £15m, due to higher [costs] and HMRC bringing tax payments 
forward". Analysts gave Paypoint a target price of 1200p and a "Buy" rating.
Profit plummeted 30 per cent at budget carrier Ryanair when it last reported and shares have fallen 14 per cent this 
month, but this still does not give Liberum analysts grounds to think they will fall much further. "The airline industry 
faces numerous short-term headwinds," they said. But they added: "Ryanair's long-term fundamentals remain intact 
and attractive, with a low cost base, market leadership, a robust balance sheet and strong cash generation." They 
gave Ryanair, which is listed in London and Dublin, a "Buy" rating and a target price of 1250 cents.
Specialist retailer Topps Tiles' profit fell 20 per cent in the first half of the year, but it has not stopped Liberum 
analysts from predicting the firm will build its share price in the coming weeks. The UK's tile retail sector is "highly 
fragmented," they wrote, giving Topps the perfect opportunity to fulfil its ambition of becoming the market leader 
within the next five years. "Topps' entry into the UK commercial tile space doubles its total addressable market size 
to over £700m," they added. They gave Topps a target price of 95p and a "Buy" rating.

Gatwick drones disrupt EasyJet results Low-cost carrier cites chaos caused by unmanned air vehicles near

Gatwick drones disrupt EasyJet results; Low-cost carrier cites chaos caused 
by unmanned air vehicles near London airport in December for first-half 
losses

Increased capacity and the drone chaos at London Gatwick airport in December are among the factors EasyJet is 
citing after its pre-tax loss for its first half ended 31 March rose to £272 million ($348 million) from £68 million for the 
same period a year ago.
The UK low-cost carrier’s chief executive Johan Lundgren said the performance in its traditional low season was “in 
line with expectations” and the airline has retained its full-year profit guidance.
Revenue rose 7.3% to £2.34 billion, as capacity growth and a foreign-exchange benefit outweighed the negative 
impacts of Easter’s timing, the implementation of new IFRS 15 accounting standards, and “annualisation of prior-
year benefits such as Monarch’s bankruptcy and Ryanair cancelling a large proportion of its winter 2017/18 
schedule in the UK”.
On a per-seat basis, revenue fell 6.3%, or 7.4% at constant currency, while headline cost per seat increased 3.9%, 
or 1.3% at constant currency. The airline points to fuel price rises, foreign-exchange effects, underlying cost 
inflation, investments in “resilience” and the impact of the drone episode at Gatwick in December.
These were mitigated by a cost programme and fleet upgauging, the Luton-based airline says.
Capacity was lifted some 15% in the six-month period, “principally due to the annualising of new operations in 
Berlin”, notes EasyJet. It grew existing network capacity by 7%. Load factor fell a percentage point to 90.1%, while 
passenger numbers rose 13% to 41.6 million.
The carrier says the rise in its headline loss reflects the increased volume of capacity as well as revenue and cost 
drivers and “EasyJet’s normal seasonality”. The airline makes the bulk of its profits over the second half of its 
financial year, which encompasses the key summer season, and pre-tax profit expectations for the full year remain 
unchanged.

London airport in December for first-half losses
EasyJet’s capacity is to be upped 7% in the six-month period. Forward bookings in the third quarter are three 
percentage points behind last year, at 72%, and flat for the fourth quarter, at 34%.

Ryanair is preparing to sell a batch of its 10 oldest Boeing 737-800s as part of its fleet renewal programme.
Speaking during a webcast analyst interview on 20 May, Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary said the carrier 
was “very close” to a $170 million deal covering the 737NGs, but did not specify who would buy the jets.
Ryanair has received the “strongest bids” from purchasers who plan to convert the narrowbodies into cargo format 
for the Chinese market. These buyers are seeking aircraft aged 15-18 years old and are prepared to pay “attractive 
prices” for them, he notes.
O’Leary expects that the jets will be delivered to their new owners by the end of March 2020, assuming that the 
airline’s first on-order 737 Max jets arrive as scheduled during winter 2019-2020.
Once the transaction is closed, Ryanair plans to move on to selling “smaller packages” of “slightly younger” 737-
800s, he says.
Cirium’s Fleets Analyzer shows that Ryanair has a fleet of 431 737-800s in service; the airline’s 10 oldest examples 
have an average age of 16.3 years. However, the most elderly aircraft in its fleet is a 20-year-old 737-700 (EI-SEV), 
which is used as a corporate shuttle.
O’Leary describes the current market for leased aircraft as being “slightly strange”, noting that Austrian subsidiary 
Laudamotion has been quoted “very high” prices for new Airbus aircraft as a result of the global Max grounding.
By contrast, Laudamotion is seeing “extraordinary” value in the lease market for second-hand jets. O’Leary notes 
that for the 23 aircraft the carrier has taken this summer on five-year operating leases, rates are “well below” 
$200,000 per month for aircraft aged seven to nine years old.

O’Leary says Ryanair is “very keen” to grow Laudamotion if it can find “that kind of value” in the operating lease 
market. He says there has been dialogue with Boeing on potential new aircraft for the airline, but notes that full 
orderbooks have pushed up prices.

Ryanair has delayed the delivery of its first five Boeing 737 Max jets to the winter 2019-2020 season, as a result of 
the worldwide grounding of the re-engined type.
But the budget carrier insists it has “utmost confidence” in the aircraft.
Ryanair has ordered up to 210 of the aircraft, which will be delivered in a high-density configuration featuring 197 
seats.
Its first five aircraft, due to arrive in summer, will be pushed back to November this year. Another 42 due over the 
winter season will be delivered over the summer of 2020.
Pre-delivery payments have been “frozen”, the carrier states, and it adds that it “expects” Boeing to cover lost 
profits. Ryanair is engaged in talks with the US airframer.
The airline says its revised delivery schedule depends on European Union Aviation Safety Agency approval.
Ryanair says the delayed deliveries means the airline will “not see any meaningful cost benefit” until its 2021 fiscal 
year. But it states that the aircraft will generate “significant” unit-cost savings for the next five years.

Austrian motorsport star Niki Lauda, who has died aged 70, will be remembered by the aviation industry not just for 
his racing achievements, but also for the airlines that bore his name and sought, over several tempestuous 
decades, to challenge the dominance of his nation’s flag-carrier – and ultimately Lufthansa in Vienna.
In his Formula 1 career, Lauda won the World Drivers’ Championship three times, in 1975, 1977 and 1984. The 
latter two wins came after he was seriously injured when his car burst into flames during the 1976 German Grand 
Prix at the Nurburgring.
He made his foray into aviation in 1979 when he founded Lauda Air, a leisure airline based in Vienna. After his last 
F1 win and retirement from racing in 1984, Lauda was able to focus more closely on the airline.
The carrier initially operated passenger charter services within Europe, and scheduled operations were licensed in 
1987. In the teeth of opposition from Austrian Airlines, Lauda Air obtained licences for international flights and 
would branch out into long-haul services to destinations such as Bangkok, Hong Kong and Sydney.
Lufthansa took a 26.5% stake in Lauda Air in 1993, but it was rival Austrian Airlines that would ultimately gain 
control of its neighbour carrier in 1997, with Lufthansa holding 20% and Lauda retaining 30%.
In 2000, Lauda resigned as chairman of the airline following a public spat with Austrian chief executives Herbert 
Bammer and Mario Rehulka over Lauda Air’s losses, as it struggled with high fuel prices and the strength of the US 
dollar.
A year later, Lauda ended his dispute with Austrian when he agreed to sell his remaining shares in Lauda Air to the 
flag carrier. The Lauda Air brand would ultimately disappear in 2012.
Lauda's drive to be an airline champion; Motorsport legend brought same indomitable winning mentality to 
carriers he created as he did to Grand Prix races
In 1993, Lauda started a new airline called Lauda Air Italy, which operated out of Milan. That carrier would 
ultimately be acquired by its Italian compatriot Livingston a decade later.
Lauda then created a new airline – Niki – in 2003, using assets from the Austrian arm of defunct German carrier Aer 
Lloyd.
Niki undertook a rapid expansion into European short-haul markets and Air Berlin secured a 24% stake, taking full 
control in 2011, although Lauda stayed on as a non-executive director of the German carrier.
protracted victory
Unfortunately Niki was caught up in the collapse of Air Berlin in 2017, but a protracted sale process eventually saw 
Lauda emerge as the victor, retaking possession of his former carrier, renaming it Laudamotion and establishing a 
Vienna base.
If that were not surprising enough, Ryanair went on to secure an initial 25% stake, taking full control earlier this 
year.
In the course of his business dealings Lauda never shied away from challenging the status quo.
“Running an airline is the most difficult job in the world,” Lauda told Flight Daily News in 2009. “Racing was more 
dangerous for my life.
“To have a real challenge when I stopped racing, which was a difficult life in another way, I founded an airline. 
Driving is easy if you do it right like [Jenson] Button. You win easily because you have the best car and make a lot 
of money. In aviation you never make a lot of money.”

CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: Airlines Struggle, Retail Recovers
CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: Airlines Struggle, Retail Recovers

 News in the consumer services sector this week continued to highlight struggles in the travel sector, with Irish 
budget airline Ryanair reporting a significant fall in profit. 
Meanwhile, results from retailers Marks & Spencer and B&M European Value Retail showed improved 
performances in the retail sector, as both reported a profit jump.
Ryanair started the week posting a 41% drop in annual pretax profit to EUR948.1 million due to higher oil prices, up 
23% in the year, and lower fares in a competitive market. Group revenue, for the year to march 31, rose 6% to 
EUR7.69 billion.
Furthermore, the low-cost airline warned of "zero" visibility on its results beyond the next few months.
Ryanair was not the only struggling airline in a year which saw a number of EU airlines failing including Primera, 
Sky Works and WOW. Flybe was sold, while both Alitalia and Thomas Cook's airline are currently for sale.
With regards to the sale of its airline, travel operator Thomas Cook on Thursday confirmed receiving an offer from 
private equity firm Triton Partners for its Nordic operations.
The travel company's Nordic business comprises of its tour operator and airline in Norway, Sweden, Finland and 
Denmark.
Thomas Cook said it was evaluating the offer alongside its ongoing strategic review of its group airline. The group 
said it has so far received multiple bids for parts and the whole of the airline business.
Also on Thursday, Thomas Cook received less positive news, with Fitch, S&P and Moody's downgrading the stock 
on concerns of weak trading and further deterioration.
Meanwhile, retailers seemed to be having a better time. 
CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: Airlines Struggle, Retail Recovers
On Wednesday, homeware, clothing and food retailer Marks & Spencer Group reported a moderate decline in 
revenue but double-digit profit growth in its recently-ended financial year to March.
M&S said pretax profit rose 27% to GBP84.6 million despite revenue falling 3.0% to GBP10.38 billion. This was 
achieved thanks to the ongoing transformation programme launched by the company with the aim of delivering cost 
savings and growing the business. 
On Thursday, discount homewares retailer B&M European Value Retail also reported a positive annual 
performance with both revenue and profit increasing on the prior year.
For the year ended March 30, B&M posted pretax profit up 8.7% to GBP249.4 million and revenue increased 17% 
to GBP3.48 billion. UK B&M store fascia revenue rose 8.7%, 0.7% on a like-for-like basis.
Furthermore, reflecting the positive results, B&M upped its total payout 5.7% to 7.6 pence.
Looking ahead, the company reported a "pleasing start" to the first quarter of financial 2020, with mid-single digit 
like-for-like growth in B&M UK fascia stores.
Meanwhile on Friday, struggling baby products retailer Mothercare also published improved results as the effects of 
its restructuring programme slashed costs by 29%. 
This resulted in Mothercare's pretax loss narrowing to GBP66.6 million for the year to March 30, compared to the 
GBP94.0 million loss reported the year earlier.
However, revenue also declined by 12% to GBP513.8 million from GBP580.6 million the year before, due to the 
chain's UK store closure programme. 
"We have achieved a huge amount this year, refinancing, restructuring and reorganising Mothercare to ensure a 
sustainable future for the business," said Chief Executive Mark Newton-Jones. "Whilst this major restructuring 
activity has resulted in significant headline losses for the year, the business is now on a sounder financial footing." 
Lastly, FTSE 250 stationery & books retailer WH Smith on Tuesday announced its chief executive's departure, as 
sales in the third quarter of the year improved significantly. 
After 15 years with WH Smith, six of which as CEO, Stephen Clarke will step down from the board at the end of 
October, as he plans to "take a break".
Carl Cowling, managing director of the company's High Street business, will take over the role of CEO from 
November 1.
On the same day, reflecting improvements in the retail sector, WH Smith reported a 15% sales increase, 1% on a 
like-for-like basis in the 11-week period from March 1 to May 18.
The company's Travel unit saw sales up 26% while the High Street business continued to experience struggles with 
sales down by 1%.

Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max by 
being the first to buy more once the aircraft has been cleared to return to service.
The Irish low-cost carrier is a major customer for the 737. According to Cirium’s Fleets Analyzer, it operates a fleet 
of 431 737NGs and hold orders for 135 of the Max variant along with 75 options.
Ryanair was due to receive its first Max in April and take five more during the 2019 summer season. But deliveries 
are suspended in the wake of the fleet-wide grounding that followed the second Max accident in March.
Max Kingsley-Jones / FlightGlobal
Speaking to CNBC TV, O’Leary said the loss of capacity caused by the Max delivery delay will “cost [Ryanair] about 
a million passengers through the summer” and that the next batch of 50 deliveries due from the fourth quarter of 
2019 are not now expected until late this year or early next.
O’Leary says that talks with Boeing regarding compensation to cover lost revenue will focus on discounting rather 
than a cash settlement with the US manufacturer.
“We’re having a discussion with Boeing. I think they will have to sensibly approach the losses, the million 
passengers we’ve lost this year,” he says.
“I’m always much more interested in the cost of aircraftI don’t need cash compensation. I’d like to see some 
movement from Boeing on the pricing of aircraft and on future orders.”

Ryanair is currently in talks with Boeing about placing another 737 order, says O’Leary. “Boeing don’t have the 
headspace at the moment to talk about future growth. We do.
“Ryanair will certainly be at the front of the queue once the Max is back flying about the next order because we 
want to demonstrate our confidence in Boeing.”
Meanwhile, emphasising Ryanair’s long-standing partnership with Boeing, O’Leary told CNBC he thinks the US 
manufacturer has handled the Max crisis “reasonably well. Once there was a known problemthey identified what the 
issue is.”
He concedes that “there are learnings for the FAA. Maybe the regulatory process with the manufacturer was a bit 
too close. Maybe there needs to be a bit more scrutiny. Ultimately, we’ve got great confidence in Boeing, in the FAA 
and in EASA.”

Police are appealing for information after a tractor driver failed to stop after colliding with a car.
A woman was driving her silver Kia Sportage near the riding stables, off Common Mead Lane, in Gillingham, 
Dorset, when she pulled in behind a Volkswagen van to allow a green Fendt tractor to pass.
However, as the tractor passed it scraped the side of her car and ripped off the bumper.

The incident happened at around 11.30am on Friday 12 April.
Sergeant Steve Hughes, of North Dorset police, said: “The victim had dashcam fitted in her vehicle at the time of 
the collision and efforts have been made to identify the tractor and its driver, however these have so far been 
unsuccessful.
“I am now issuing an image from the dashcam in the hope that someone can help me identify the tractor and trailer 
involved.”
Police appeal
It is not clear if the tractor driver works in or is connected to the farming industry. But the driver was transporting 
construction-type rolls on the trailer.

Arla is holding its farmer members’ milk prices for June, at 30.23p/litre for a manufacturing litre for conventional milk 
and 41.98p for organic supplies.
This is based on every-other-day collection of a minimum 1m litres of top quality band milk at 4.2% butterfat and 
3.4% protein.
The Arla move is the fifth consecutive monthly price hold for the group's 2,500 UK farmer members. It follows a 
0.3p/litre cut by UK co-op First Milk for June, taking its farmgate liquid contract price to 27.45p/litre and those on a 
manufacturing contract to 28.37p/litre.

This was the first cut for the farmer-owned co-operative since February, when it reduced the price paid by 
0.25p/litre in response to downward pressure on cheese markets.
The UK continues to see strong growth in milk volumes compared to last year, however, overall European milk 
volumes remain at the same level, said Arla Foods amba board director and farmer owner, Johnnie Russell.
The organic sector was under pressure in some European markets, he said. Milk powder prices were steady, with 
strong global demand underpinning the market; continuing uncertainty in Europe was holding back fat prices, and 
cheese prices had cautiously started to move positively over the past few weeks.

Winning the champions of champions sash for the first time at Balmoral was Philip Jones of Hallow Holsteins.
The Hallow Holsteins team made it a clean sweep in the breed championship earlier in the day, taking champion, 
reserve and honourable mention in the Holstein finale.
Beating off stiff competition in the interbreed class, under the eye of stalwart judge Meurig James, was their 
homebred heifer, Hallow Atwood Twizzle 1181, classified VG88 as a two-year-old.
Sired by Atwood and out of Hallow Advent Twizzle, she last calved in December and is currently giving 45 litres 
daily at 3.5% protein and 4% butterfat.
She is no stranger to the showring, having won honourable mention at the Royal Ulster Winter Fair last year.

She now heads home to the Jones’ 80-cow herd in Gorey, Wexford, to rest and will return to Ulster in December 
where Philip hopes she’ll repeat her performance.
Reserve Holstein
In reserve “by a whisper” was the Jersey champion Clandeboye Tequila Cookie from Clandeboye Estate, Bangor, 
Co Down.
She went one better after scooping the reserve rosette in the interbreed last year.
Sired by Tower Vue Prime Tequila she is out of Newmoor Sultan Cookie and is classified Ex93 – the maximum 
score for a third calver.
She last calved in November and is currently giving 28kg daily at 5.9% butterfat and 4.1% protein.
She now heads home to rest and may be shown in-milk at the Royal Ulster once she’s calved with her fourth this 
November.
Commenting on his placings, Mr James said the Holstein had “tremendous style” and was “very correct in the udder 
and teat” adding:
“The champion and reserve were very close indeed. The champion only won it by a whisper. I think the Holstein 
cow today is that fraction more dairy and just a little cleaner and longer through the shoulder and neck.”

The Beef Shorthorn took the interbreed trophy from a strongly-contested line-up of 15 breed champions and the 
commercial beef winner.
Judge Danny Wylie, from Staffordshire, did not hesitate in tapping out the “mighty” second calver, Ricketstown 
Lovely 191, from the all-female shortlist, making it a first for exhibitor Duncan McDowell.
Mr McDowell, who runs 40 pedigree Beef Shorthorns in Newtownards, Co Down, bought Lovely as a maiden heifer 
from Martin Kelly of Ricketstown Beef Shorthorns.
She was shown with her five-month-old, Elliot Matrix-sired daughter at foot.

In reserve and returning to the show after a five-year absence, was William Smith, Oldcastle, Co Meath, with his 
January 2018-born, homebred heifer Millbrook Nelenya.
Sired by Wilodge Vantastic she is out of Millbrook Enya and is seven generations homebred.
Nelenya is the third generation of her dam line to win at Balmoral and takes Mr Smiths’ interbreed tally to six.
Her granddam, Millbrook Ullr, won the reserve interbreed sash in 2009. Nelenya’s aunt, Millbrook Celine, won the 
supreme champion title in 2011.
And their stablemate, Millbrook Ginger Spice, made it a hattrick when she won interbreed at Balmoral for the third 
consecutive year in 2014.

A sheep and beef farmer from the Orkney Islands and a West Country beef producer have been crowned Britain's 
Fittest Farmers 2019.
Sean Cursiter from Orkney and Fiona Penfold from Somerset were victorious at the inaugural live final of Farmers 
Weekly's competition, which aims to promote mental and physical health in agriculture in a fun and engaging way.
Our winners were two of 14 finalists picked from hundreds of applicants, who competed at an event co-hosted by 
Farm Fitness founder Tom Kemp at his family farm in Essex.
See also: Video: Britain's Fittest Farmers compete for the trophy and cash prize
Having completed an interview with the judges, which focused on mental health, and five tough physical challenges 
aimed at putting their general fitness to the ultimate test, Sean and Fiona emerged triumphant.
They each take home a £500 cash prize. Watch the video of the final below.
Fiona Penfold: Most people have gone through hard times – it's normal
For beef farmer Fiona, physical and mental health go hand-in-hand. The 38-year-old took over the 65ha farm on the 
fringe of Bristol after her dad retired, and runs a 50-head Hereford cross Friesian beef suckler herd.
A big fan of obstacle course running and rugby, the mum-of-two believes in keeping active to maintain a healthy 
mindset.
“If you’re sat in tractor all day, it’s not better than being sat at a desk in an office. To have a healthier mind, you 
need to do some exercise," she says.
She entered the competition because she’s convinced of this link between physical activity and mental wellbeing, 
adding that she wants farmers stop feeling ashamed to admit they’re struggling.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
“I think farmers’ mental health has been getting worse because the physical element of their work has decreased 
gradually,” she says.
She suffered with her mental health issues about 18 years ago, struggling with an eating disorder and depression 
and found exercising was key to keeping her spirits up.
"It’s not just about talking about your problems – and that is very hard. You don’t want to talk about the fact that 
you’re finding things hard. Most people have gone through the same thing at some point – it’s normal."
Fiona competed in her first obstacle course run 15 years ago before having children, picking the sport up again in 
recent years as a way of getting off the farm to socialise and maintaining her all-round fitness.
She loves travelling the country to take part in obstacle course races and qualified for the world championships last 
year.
“I do feel guilty about taking time away from the farm sometimes, but if I don’t allow myself time to do something 
else then I can feel pretty down.
"There’s always time for a 20-minute run no matter who you are or what you’re doing.”
Fiona trains using typical farm objects and weights as her equipment, and the hills around the farm are ideal for her 
sprint training.
“I’m over the moon to have won this competition. I was really looking forward to meeting fellow farmers and we’ve 
all had a competing with a great atmosphere. Farming makes me fit – I just top it up with other exercise.”
Sean Cursiter: There are 24 hours in the day – give one to yourself
Orkney farmer Sean says setting personal goals and making a real effort to be social and active helps to tackle 
stress and rural isolation.
The 30-year-old works on the 750ha family farm, which runs 850 breeding ewes and a suckler heard of 100 cattle, 
and also does contract shearing work.
Sitting off the coast of north-east Scotland, farming on the Orkney Islands can be particularly tough. 
Cattle are typically kept indoors to shield them from the harsh elements for about 200 days of the year, which puts 
increased workload and financial stress on farmers like Sean, with extra costs of feed and bedding for livestock.
With a short number of daylight hours in winter and a sparse population on the island, rural isolation can be a real 
issue, too.
“Farmers are constantly being required to produce cheap food while input costs rise. On Orkney, there’s a lot of 
farmers on their own with 80 cows living a lonely existence – they might not see another person for weeks,” he 
explains.
That’s why he makes a conscious effort to socialise with others. Playing rugby for Orkney’s first team is a big part of 
this and he says more farmers should make time for themselves.
“If folks close themselves in and just farm then that’s not a good state of mind to be in. It’s hard to come away from 
the farm and be social, but it does have its benefits and sometimes the lack of time is over-used as an excuse.
“There are 24 hours in the day, so you need to give one to yourself. It’s good to have a hobby and I don’t find that 
my sport has a negative effect on the farm.”
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
He admits that he sometimes worries about problems the farm faces, such as the difficulties Brexit may bring. He 
finds training in his homemade gym on the farm helps relieve this stress by giving his mind a distraction.
“I’ve just come out of lambing, working 16-hour days. You’re knackered, but if you can find time to do some 
exercise then it actually re-energises you and takes your mind off of things on the farm.”
He also finds his training helps his body soak up the physical punishment of the especially long, hard days on the 
farm.
About the competition
Britain’s Fittest Farmer was launched by Farmers Weekly as a fun way of sparking a vital discussion about the 
physical and mental health of the nation's farmers.
As farming becomes less active and more mechanised and office-based, it’s more important than ever before to 
make sure Britain’s farmers are getting the exercise they need to stay fit and healthy.
Farming can also be an isolated job, which is why it is also vital for farmers to focus on their own mental health and 
wellbeing so that they can keep their business in tip-top condition too.

Farmer-owned co-operative Camgrain has renewed its grain marketing agreement with Frontier Agriculture for 
another five years.
The deal – which extends an agreement made in 2014 – means Frontier will continue to be Camgrain's principle 
marketing, distribution and strategic partner until 2024.
See also: Farm business – Crop markets, prices and trends
The five-year extension was announced on Tuesday (14 May) during a pre-harvest open day for growers at 
Camgrain's Balsham site in Cambridgeshire.
Camgrain has more than 500,000 tonnes of storage capacity supported by processing facilities, blending 
technology and food industry-standard accreditation.
Maximising value
Company chairman John Latham said: “For us, it is all about building relationships down the supply chain and 
maximising the value of members' crops.”
Frontier was a highly effective marketing business, said Mr Latham.
The partnership gave Camgrain's 500 members a route into premium markets they probably couldn't access on 
their own, he added.
The partnership was all about maximising Camgrain's investment in storage and marketing while reducing the 
amount of risk faced by members.
“The riskiest part of the supply chain is the trading side of it – we have seen problems elsewhere and we don't want 
to replicate them,” he said.
Mutual respect
Frontier had proved to be highly professional, he added.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate

There was mutual respect and an increasing level of trust between the two companies, which had built up over the 
duration of the partnership agreement.
Frontier managing director Mark Aitchison said: “It makes sense for us because not only do we buy a lot of grain 
from farmers, we also sell them a lot of inputs.
“We admired Camgrain's investment in physical facilities and state-of-the-art storage – and its ability to organise the 
supply chain for upstream customers.
“I'm very pleased that the board has decided to renew our agreement. We are very proud of the relationship – it is 
working very well.”
Mr Aitchison added: “It is a powerful combination and we think we can add more value for Camgrain members and 
the food industry as a result.”

Fungicide sprays have gone on in good time, and even in Scotland there have been few unsuitable spray days, with 
disease largely being suppressed in cereals.
However, recent rains have seen a surge in growth, which has forced some agronomists to change their growth 
regulator plans to limit the risk of lodging.
Some of this rain was in the form of heavy bursts of hail, which may have dewaxed some pulse crops, increasing 
the risk of scorch from herbicides in spring bean crops.
The rain has also caused flushes of broad-leaved weeds.
North: Mary Munro
AICC/Strutt and Parker (Perthshire)
The crop protection season is a bit of a rollercoaster, but suddenly we are over the hump and the midpoint of peak 
action is past.
The weather has been kind and there have been very few days unsuitable for spraying. We have also had a decent 
amount of rain to keep things growing.
The awns of winter barley are well out and, apart from a few specks of mildew and the very occasional bit of 
rhynchosporium, there has not been much disease around.
We are fortunate that the SDHI fungicides are very effective on the main barley diseases. Ramularia could still 
develop, but by adding chlorothalonil to the second fungicide application, I hope to control it.
Winter wheat has had its T1 and the T2s are planned – if not quite on yet. I used Adexar (epoxiconazole + 
fluxapyroxad) - or boscalid in second wheats - at T1 and will be using Ascra (bixafen + fluopyram + 
prothioconazole) or Elatus Era (benzovindiflupyr + prothioconazole) at T2.
These recent rainy days will have increased the disease pressure from septoria, and the crops are generally looking 
full of potential, so the rates will be kept up.
Yellow rust is never far away and with susceptible varieties, it has to be kept in mind in the programme.
Cleaver control
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Some growers will have a final run around the headlands to tidy up cleavers and/or bromes. The choice of cleaver 
control is wider than it used to be and we are not totally reliant on fluroxypr, which is helpful and allows a change 
from year to year to combat resistance.
I find Pacifica (iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron) good for bromes, and the aim – as with cleavers – is to stop the 
population getting a foothold in the crop.
Spring cereals have come on well, and there are some fantastic spring barley crops in the Lothians. Crop protection 
will be based on two treatments of Siltra (bixafen + prothioconazole), with chlorothalonil added in the second one 
for ramularia.
Flowering in oilseed rape has been protracted, but most crops are losing colour now as the later petals fall. My 
crops have had one mid-flowering application of Proline (prothioconazole) and the gate is shut, bar pre-harvest 
desiccants.
West: Antony Wade

The month of May is often a time when crops can look full of promise, but kind weather is still needed for crop 
potential to be realised.
Winter barley crops have finally woken up from their reluctant growth pattern earlier in the season.
However, assessing them before the T2 spray, I felt my robust T1 plant growth regulator strategy had done a good 
job in stiffening them up. So, I decided not to apply a late growth regulator, apart from to the hybrids. I’m hoping the 
possible bounce-back we get doesn’t make them too prone to lodging.
In grower trials, I have seen a positive reduction in brackling from using a fluxapyroxad-based SDHI at T2, so this 
was my choice, along with chlorothalonil for ramularia.
As we have had good tiller numbers since the autumn, I am quite optimistic about yields, as long as lodging doesn’t 
come back to haunt my T2 decisions.
Winter oats have been similarly slow to get going this spring, but are now growing fast. In some cases, contact 
herbicide applications in April have affected quite a lot of crops, with the typical reddening, hypersensitive reaction 
that oats express.
Wheat crops generally are looking very promising in my area. As mentioned, we have been fortunate to have 
enough rain to make the early fertiliser applications available to crops, so we have good tiller numbers and green 
area index.
Septoria threat
Septoria is present on lower leaves and you can find lesions on the tips of leaf four and three. With about an inch of 
rain in early May since the T1 spray – plus recent showers – robust SDHI co-form rates will be deployed.
Flag leaf emergence has been fairly leisurely, but is not far from the normal 15-22 May timing. So, by the time you 
read this, much of the crops will have been sprayed.
All the promise May brings is being countered by the disappointment of seeing blackgrass and brome heads poking 
above crops, despite the best efforts with herbicide strategies.
While it is impossible, in my opinion, to predict eventual oilseed rape yields, they look promising as they start to 
come to the end of flowering – unlike in other areas of the UK.

his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Early pod set looks good and they are holding onto green leaf area, which is vital to fill the pods.
Sclerotinia-conducive conditions haven’t really sustained high risk levels for significant periods of flowering, so the 
cost-effective single mid-flower strategy has been stuck to.
Spring cereals and pulses have established well and weed control is being completed following significant flushes 
of broad-leaved weeds. Maize crops are emerging well and pre-emergence herbicides went on in good conditions.
All this optimism with crops in my region is all well and good, but now it is in the hands of the weather. We need 
good light levels and adequate moisture so we can fulfil all the potential the crops promise.
East: Marion Self
AICC/Prime Agriculture (Suffolk)
Winter wheat flag leaf sprays have been well timed and we have managed to maintain a tight gap (three to four 
weeks) between the T1 and T2 fungicide sprays.
Robust sprays will protect the emerging flag leaf and keep the top three yield-building leaves clean. Septoria levels 
on lower canopy leaves clearly reflect the varieties' disease ratings and the time of drilling. 
Dirtier varieties drilled in September are evidently carrying a higher level of disease. Yellow rust remains a threat, 
but is currently well controlled by the recent robust and well-timed applications.
As temperatures warm up, insect pest and beneficial numbers will increase. Sugar beet crops are being monitored 
carefully by the British Beet Research Organisation, agronomists and growers alike for the increasing presence of 
aphids that transmit viruses, such as the peach potato aphid.
Aphid numbers are increasing, and in some crops the economic threshold has been reached, triggering treatment 
with an approved foliar insecticide such as Biscaya (thiacloprid) or Teppeki (flonicamid).
As a reminder, the threshold for treatment is one green wingless aphid for every four plants up to the 12-leaf stage. 
It is also helpful to visit the BBRO website to view aphid trap catches near you.
Pest pressure
We are also monitoring pea crops for pea aphids and waiting to see if orange blossom midge will be a significant 
threat to susceptible wheats when ears start to break boot and florets are exposed. 
The timing of the midge emergence will depend on soil temperatures, following rain earlier this month. Mealy aphid 
populations are visible on the headlands of rapeseed crops. Populations appear relatively high this season, but 
treatment is rarely required.
Spring cereals are at various stages of development, most nitrogen applications have been completed and T2 
fungicide treatments will be applied soon.
Now is the time to map grassweed populations. Start thinking through your control strategy for the coming season, 
make cropping and rotational decisions to combat these weeds.
Late drilling and spring cropping really does work, although persistence is required.

Recent rain – while useful – seems a distant memory already. It probably wasn’t enough to completely resolve the 
concerns about some spring crops on the Downs.
Looking at wheat crops last week, the flag leaf has now fully emerged in those fields drilled in mid- to late October. 
The rain also switched the yield potential back on and increased the disease risk, suggesting it’s vital not to let 
timings slip.
Most T2 fungicides have now been applied to winter wheat and barley. They consisted of an SDHI plus azole 
partner, or strobilurin plus azole, along with chlorothalonil – while we still have it – depending on yield potential.
Well-timed nitrogen applications, followed by the rain, will have helped make a lot of that nutrition more available 
and has certainly stimulated a surge in growth, dramatically improving some crops.
This growth surge has also necessitated the need for some late plant growth regulators on high-yield sites 
consisting of mepiquat chloride + chloroethylposphonic acid or prohexadine + triexapac ethyl.
Last week, when I looked at wheat crops drilled in mid- to late October, leaf two was half emerged, which would 
suggest a T2 flag leaf timing in about seven to 10 days, depending on temperatures.
The rain will have switched the yield potential back on and increased the disease risk, which means no holding 
back for the T2 application.
For spring crops, the rain has stimulated some broad-leaved weed emergence that will need to be addressed in the 
next few weeks, along with T1/T2 fungicides on spring cereals.
Leaf wax issues
Some of the rain has been in the form of heavy showers, including bursts of hail. These will have dewaxed affected 
pulse crops, especially peas. So, it will be important to make sure leaf wax is checked with a crystal violet test 
before contemplating herbicide applications in spring beans.
Where bentazone is planned, an interval of at least seven days will need to be observed before applying a post-
emergence grass herbicide. This is generally preferable to leaving an interval of 14 days after applying a post-
emergence grassweed herbicide.
There may be some increase in sclerotinia risk following the rain – not least as the cooler temperatures of last week 
may prolong the flowering period in what appears to remain very variable oilseed rape crops.
This month has pleasingly seen the culmination of a 12-month joint project with Weston Park Farm to grow and 
manufacture a batch of no-till potato crisps.
The aim of the project is to raise awareness and question current soil management techniques. The crisps will be 
presented to attendees at this year’s Groundswell Conference.
With assistance from Whitewater Potatoes in Hampshire, Fairfields Farm crisps in Essex, and the very willing team 
at Weston Park Farms, I am hugely grateful to all involved.

Farmers Weekly reported earlier in the year that farm businesses not in schemes were cautious about entering this 
year, as they were concerned being in CS may have an effect on joining the Environmental Land Management 
scheme in future.
However, Defra has assured farmers that entering an environmental scheme now will not have a negative impact 
on their eligibility for future schemes.
Ed Trotter, farming consultant in the Stamford office of Strutt & Parker, said: "Anyone requesting a pack is not

Mr Trotter said the mid-tier scheme is an excellent opportunity for landowners to apply for grant funding for capital 
items such as planting new hedgerows or erecting livestock fencing to protect environmental features or to prevent 
water pollution.
Options such as a two-year legume fallow (AB15) or enhanced overwinter stubble (AB6) offer an alternative to low-
margin break crops such as oilseed rape or field beans.
JOURNAL : Farmers Weekly
An on-farm trial of defoliation methods in West Sussex has reduced cabbage stem flea beetle larvae numbers by up 
to 61% this spring.
Larvae numbers in grower Paul Helyer’s oilseed rape crops at his farm near Chichester, part of the Plain Farming 
Group, had jumped up from one or two larvae per plant in recent years to well over 10 per plant this season.
One of Mr Helyer’s agronomists, Jonathan James of Chichester Crop Consultancy (CCC), took larvae counts 
across the farm in December.
This was as part of his work co-ordinating the Association of Independent Crop Consultant's cabbage stem flea 
beetle national survey, where he found very high numbers in certain fields.

As a result, Mr Helyer is one of several growers taking part in an Innovative Farmers Field lab this season, trialling 
defoliation by both grazing and mechanical topping.
“While we could still grow the crop, we wanted to develop a sustainable means of growing it,” says fellow CCC 
agronomist Richard Cartwright.
In the autumn, larvae move into the plant’s petiole to overwinter before migrating to the stem in the spring, when 
they do the most damage.
Defoliating the newer leaves works in two ways – by removing the older leaves, larvae are unable to migrate to the 
stem in the spring, while also exposing the larvae to the cold.
Early grazing
Mr Helyer drilled 50ha of varieties Elgar and Imperial using a Vaderstad min-till drill in the last week of August.

his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
He holds off from drilling too early as being on the south coast crops can get too large, and the highest numbers of 
larvae are associated with the earliest drilled crops, according to AICC data.
In the grazing trial, sheep from a neighbouring farmer started grazing the crops around 17 December at a net 
benefit to Mr Helyer of between £10/ha  and £20/ha.
Ideally, to not affect yields, the sheep need to be moved off the crops by the middle of January.
Counts in the spring show that early grazing resulted in a 39% reduction of larvae, while later grazing resulted in a 
61% reduction, but also removed too much of the crop.
At this stage of the trial, both Mr James and Mr Cartwright say grazing is the best method of defoliating, as the 
sheep eat most of the petioles, or trample them.
However, for Mr Helyer, despite the small additional cost of topping of £10/ha, mowing would be his preferred 
option when considering the total 160ha of OSR crop grown by the Plain Farming Group.
“With topping there is a small cost, but from a timeliness and workrate point of view it is better. To do grazing we 
would need thousands of sheep,” he says.
Although a much larger area can be defoliated in a short space of time, a level seed-bed is critical to ensuring the 
crop can be consistently removed, and conditions in December must be fit to travel.
Two fields topped at the same time showed a 14% and a 49% reduction in larvae numbers, while untreated plots 
had 37 larvae per plant.
Plant recovery
This season, the topped crops are shorter than the grazed ones, while in previous trials they have been shorter.
“The ability of the crop to recover is very much related to the inherent yield potential of the soil.
“The critical thing is the timing of the defoliation and making sure to get the nitrogen plus sulphur on early to rebuild 
the green index area,” says Mr Cartwright.
Crops on poorer soils are two weeks behind those on the best soils, but flowering will be delayed in all defoliated 
crops.
High levels of pollen beetle meant that all of the defoliated crops have had to be treated.
In a very good year Mr Helyer would expect to achieve 4.9t/ha.
For topping to be worthwhile, Mr Helyer says he would need the mowed crops to achieve 4.32t/ha at harvest, and 
the untreated areas to yield substantially lower.

The return date of a popular small grants scheme for purchasing agricultural equipment is still up in the air, despite 
Defra promising to launch it in early 2019.
The first round of the Rural Development Programme for England’s Countryside Productivity Small Grant scheme 
opened for applications in February 2018 and saw farmers claim a total of £15m worth of funding.
Grants of between £3,000 and £12,000 were available for assistance with buying pieces of equipment from a set list 
of items.

It is believed that the government has made £30m available for funding the second round of the scheme.
However, despite Defra stating the next application window would open early this year, to date there has been no 
such confirmation.
Instead, on Tuesday (21 May), a Defra spokesman said: “We are considering the most appropriate time to launch 
the second round of funding, taking into account the other CAP application windows currently open to farmers.
“We will provide an update to farmers ahead of this next round opening.”
A spokesman for the CLA said it is believed the earliest the scheme will be relaunched is mid- to late June.
Richard Wordsworth, NFU senior BPS adviser, said he has not been told when the scheme is expected to return 
and called the delay frustrating.
“There was lots of interest in last year’s scheme and time is marching on,” he said.
“The most appropriate time, in my opinion, is one that avoids the busier times in the farming calendar, such as 
harvest, to allow people time to apply.”
When the scheme returns, it’s likely there will be a new guidance booklet with more eligible items and some 
clarification on rules, Mr Wordsworth said.
With the money currently sourced through the EU, he also hopes for more clarification about whether any further 
rounds of the scheme will go ahead.

The government has pledged to help producers prepare for a big drop in farm incomes as direct payments are 
phased out after Brexit.
It comes amid growing concern that thousands of family farms could be plunged into crisis – sparking fears for 
farmers' mental health and wellbeing – as the support payments are abolished after the UK leaves the European 
Union.
See also: How and why farm charities can help you
Defra's own statistics show that 16% of farm businesses are already unprofitable – even while direct payments 
continue to be made.
That would rise to 42% without direct payments, which the government intends to phase out over seven years from 
2021.
Resilient farmers
The issue was raised repeatedly this week by delegates and speakers at a Resilient Farmers Conference hosted by 
the Farm Safety Foundation.
The event brought together farm charities to discuss ways of supporting farmers and improve mental health in the 
industry.
Suicide rates among agricultural workers are already almost twice the national average, according to the Office for 
National Statistics.
Voluntary groups working with farmers fear they could climb even higher unless the phase-out is properly managed.

Building resilience among farming families is seen as a key way of helping growers and livestock producers prepare 
for life without direct payments.
Tricia Allen, of Defra's resilience and transformation team, said she was keen to work with the industry to achieve 
this.
“There is already an issue in physical and mental wellbeing across the sector – even before any significant changes 
are going to be implemented,” acknowledged Ms Allen.
No cliff edges
The government was committed to understanding the impact of any new policies on wellbeing, said Ms Allen.
Over the next 18 months, this would include a detailed policy for the tapered phase-out of direct payments, which 
would avoid “any significant cliff edges”.
Grants and loan schemes to enhance productivity and innovation would also be investigated, said Ms Allen.
So too would ways that farms and land managers can access funds under Defra's forthcoming Environmental Land 
Management Scheme.
Emphasising the need to manage the transition without adversely affecting mental health and wellbeing, Ms Allen 
said: “We do recognise the importance of leading this transformation in a way which doesn't exacerbate these 
trends, and preferably improves the situation.”
Rural isolation and loneliness are seen as key challenges when it comes to building resilience in the sector.
The issue will be discussed next month at a Defra stakeholder meeting, due to be chaired by Defra junior minister 
Lord Gardiner.
Helpline calls 'just tip of the iceberg'
An increase in helpline calls from farmers is only the tip of the iceberg, say rural charities, who are bracing 
themselves for an increase in requests for support.
The Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution saw a 47% increase in calls from working farmers last year.
Many related to helping farmers with benefits advice, including filling in forms, making applications and helping with 
appeals.
The Farming Community Network says it has seen a 10-15% increase in calls in recent months, but this is mainly in 
parts of the country where the charity has stepped up is activity rather than nationally.
Network chief executive Charles Smith said the charity was trying to be proactive.
Rather than focusing on doom and gloom, it was important to “walk alongside farmers” to tackle issues before they 
reached crisis level, he added.
“We feel it is the tip of the iceberg," he said.
"We often talk about the need to help hard-to-reach farmers and that is exactly what we need to do.
"People are coming to us with problems that are more complex and difficult for them to unravel.
“There is a lot of talk about the impact that phasing out payments will have on farm businesses.

New Defra rules mean farmers in England who charge the public to attend events involving livestock or working 
animals will have to get permission, to avoid falling foul of animal welfare law.
The Animal Welfare (Licensing of activities including animals) England) Regulation 2018 came in to force last 
October aiming to increase standards for animals used for exhibitions. 
See also: Opinion: Preparation is the key to success for Open Farm Sunday
Farmers who invite members of the public on to their land for paid-for events such as sheepdog exhibitions, 
livestock showing, turnout or lambing will require a licence costing around £260, however the cost could change 
from area to area.
The regulations do stipulate that a donkey in a nativity play would be exempt from licensing.
The legislation states that farmers who hold such events on a regular basis or who hold them infrequently but make 
“high profit margins” will need a licence that lasts for three years.
Applicants will have to apply to their local authority and pass an inspection to ensure their premises are suitable for 
exhibiting animals to the public.
Open to interpretation
However, the regulations delegate a large degree of discretion to local authorities, so individuals uncertain whether 
the rules apply to them should consult their local council.
Defra extended the pre-existing legislation to protect livestock on farms in conjunction with a move by environment 
secretary Michael Gove to ban the use of wild animals in travelling circuses.
“There was a purposeful shift to improve protection and intentionally broaden the requirements for licensing of 
businesses that exhibit animals,” said a Defra spokesperson.
Open Farm Sunday
Although the majority of individuals taking part in Leaf Open Farm Sunday (OFS) would not be affected by the 
changes, there would be some requiring licences, according to event manager Annabel Shackleton.
“It’s crucial as an industry that we continue to connect with the public and get them out on farms,” said Ms 
Shackleton.
“As farmers, we already have so many regulations with health and safety inspections and food hygiene rules.
“But it is important to maintain these high standards and show our visitors what we do as an industry.”
She added that any participants with concerns should contact the organisation for advice and guidance on the rule 
changes.
The NFU said it was seeking clarification from Defra on the exact circumstances under which members could be 
required to hold a licence under the new regulations ahead of Open Farm Sunday next month.
“Once we have this information from Defra, we will communicate this to our members as soon as possible.”

The Dairy Crest brand name will be replaced by Saputo Dairy UK from July, its new boss Tom Atherton has 
confirmed.
The name change follows the acquisition of Dairy Crest by Canadian dairy processor Saputo in a deal worth almost 
£1bn in April.
But Mr Atherton said there were currently no plans to change the name of Dairy Crest Direct – the producer 
organisation of 330 south-west dairy farmers – which supplies the milk used to produce its Cathedral City and 
Davidstow cheddars.
See also: Video: So you want to sell milk direct from farm?
He also revealed plans to increase cheese output from 50,000t each year at its Davidstow factory to 77,000t in the 
next few years.
And Mr Atherton said this would involve a deeper relationship with existing dairy producers – and potentially the 
need for new milk suppliers.
“I’m really proud of our relationship with Dairy Crest Direct – it’s going deepen and carry on,” he told Farmers 
Weekly.
“All our milk producers are located within 80 miles of our Davidstow factory in the South West.
“The Dairy Crest Direct name will move under the Saputo umbrella.
"That relationship is incredibly important to us. It underlines our company. That strategy does not change.”
“As that side of the business grows, we will want more milk. Cathedral City is a big, profitable brand,” he added.
“My priority would be existing farmers first and allow them to grow with us.
"But there is potential to take some new farmers on.”
Mr Atherton said Saputo would also be looking to export its UK-produced cheddar cheese brand across Europe, the 
US and Canada.
Top 10 dairy processor
Saputo is one of the top 10 dairy processors in the world, with production facilities in Canada, the US, Argentina 
and Australia.
The company produces and retails a wide range of dairy products and it prides itself on high-quality cheeses.
Mr Atherton, who has worked for Dairy Crest since 2005, was recently appointed president and chief operating 
officer of Saputo’s newly-formed Dairy Division (UK).
He is replacing long-serving Dairy Crest chief executive officer, Mark Allen, who will remain at the company until 
July to ensure a smooth transition.
A short history of Dairy Crest
Dairy Crest was established in 1981, as the milk processing arm of the Milk Marketing Board.
In 1983, the company launched Clover, its dairy spread.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate

In 1995, the company acquired outright ownership of Cathedral City cheddar, which has gone on to become the 
nation’s favourite cheese brand.
In 2004, Dairy Crest completed a major expansion of the Davidstow creamery completes, increasing its cheddar-
making capacity to about 50,000t/year. 
The sale of its dairies business to Müller in 2015 enabled Dairy Crest to reposition itself as a branded, high-growth 
company.
In 2018, Dairy Crest announced an £85m investment to increase cheese production capacity at its Davidstow 
creamery, improve environmental credentials and enhance packaging capabilities.
Dairy Crest Group Plc was acquired by Canadian dairy processor Saputo in a deal worth £975m on 15 April 2019.

In the space of 10 years, one Essex farmer has improved a ryegrass problem, which had resulted in fields of wheat 
being cut for silage, to a situation where this year’s crops are largely clean of the weed.
Daniel Wormell, who farms the 600ha family farm, says ryegrass has been a problem for more than two decades at 
Langenhoe Hall Farm, situated close to the north Essex coast.
“We don’t know where it came from, but it may be from herbage seed crops that were previously grown on the 
farm.”
Testing revealed that Mr Wormell has triple-R resistant ryegrass and he decided something had to change.
See also: How Oxfordshire farmer cleaned up a bad blackgrass problem
He set out to tackle the problem alongside agronomist Sara Osbourne of Prime Agriculture, with an integrated 
approach – largely based on the Rothamsted advice for blackgrass – which is a combination of cultural approaches 
and chemistry.
It is proving successful and the fields that had been silaged 10 years ago are now looking clean, with very low 
populations. Wheat yield targets are now 11t/ha, whereas nine or 10 years ago he would have been happy with 
7.5t/ha.
However, “you cannot be complacent,” he says, highlighting last season’s blip.
“The dry autumn [2018] conditions meant pre-emergence herbicides were less effective, which was a step back for 
us in terms of control.”
Langenhoe Hall Farm facts
600ha family farm  
Heavy clay soils in a low rainfall area (550mm)
Cropping includes milling wheat (spring and winter), linseed, oilseed rape and winter beans
 
Here is Mr Wormell’s approach:
1 Rotational ploughing
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Rotational ploughing is a valuable part of Mr Wormell’s approach, but it has to be good-quality ploughing with full 
inversion of the furrow to bury the seed.
Ploughing is carried out in the autumn on land destined for spring wheat.
“It weathers down over winter and then we move as little soil as we can in the following spring.”
The thinking is that the seed is buried and in the years between, only the surface is moved.
2 Delayed drilling
A key change that enabled later drilling was the purchase of an 8m Dale Ecodrill. Delayed drilling gives more time 
for stale seed-beds, and means there is usually more moisture around for the pre-ems to work well.
“We used to drill at the end of September, when Atlantis (iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron) was first introduced with the 
aim of creating a competitive crop, and trying to ensure that the Atlantis applications were made in optimal growing 
conditions.
“Now we are seeing less control from post-emergence products across the board, the approach has had to 
change,’’ says Mr Wormell.
Previously, he had a Horsch CO4 and because the aim was to drill later into the season it could cause issues if the 
weather was wet on his heavy soils.
“We sometimes got caught out as the packer could block and stop turning in wet conditions,’’ he says.
Drilling is now carried out mid- to late October onwards, depending on conditions. “We aim to drill only if conditions 
are right, after there has been a flush of weeds and with moisture present in the soil.”
Being too dry is a problem, which is why he held off until mid-November last autumn, to ensure there was sufficient 
moisture for the pre-emergence herbicides.
“Even then, last year soil moisture wasn’t ideal and we suffered with compromised weed control throughout the 
season,’’ he says.
To encourage a chit of ryegrass for some direct-drilled first wheats, Mr Wormell will run a stubble rake after the 
combine followed by rolls and one or two applications of glyphosate.
“We may rake again if there is some moisture to encourage germination.”
“Ideally we would like to see a chit before starting any primary cultivation, but this depends on the weather in 
August,’’ he adds.
3 Introduce spring cropping
Just five years ago, there were no spring crops in the rotation at Langenhoe Hall Farm and now there is spring 
linseed and spring milling wheat.
Spring wheat is effectively the second wheat in a rotation of winter wheat, followed by oilseed rape, winter wheat, 
spring wheat (second wheat) and winter beans or linseed.
“We are on heavy clay soils and we were always wary about growing spring crops,’’ says Mr Wormell.
However, he believes the key to making it work is ploughing in autumn and then drilling in spring with the low-
disturbance Dale Ecodrill.
“It gives us flexibility, as it can direct drill wheat in the autumn and also drill cultivated land.”

Harry Fordham, Syngenta area manager for south Essex and Kent says spring barley is more competitive than 
spring wheat.
However, Mr Wormell grows wheat as he can consistently hit milling specification whereas meeting malting barley 
specs is more of a challenge on his soils.
His two spring crops also have different drilling dates (February/March for spring wheat and March/April for linseed), 
as it helps stop the weed adapting to the system.
“In my view you have got to keep confusing the weed with timings and chemistry”
4 Straw management
He bales most of his straw and believes it helps reduce seed return. Mr Wormell points to Australian farmers, who 
are experienced at managing ryegrass, using chaff decks and mills to manage seed.
“Unlike blackgrass, there is still a lot of seed in the head at harvest. So if you bale straw, you are going to take 
some of the seed out,” he says.
5 Pre-emergence herbicide hit
He hits the weed hard with a pre-emergence stack based on Crystal (flufenacet + pendimethalin) plus diflufenican 
and Defy (prosulfocarb). Where needed, he will follow with a top up of pendimethlin with a peri-/post-emergence 
application of Atlantis.
One key difference with blackgrass is spring germination, although these plants tend to be less competitive with 
less seed return.
In oilseed rape, he relies on carbetamide and propyzamide, as differing modes of action targeting ryegrass.
6 Seed rates
Seed rates have been upped to increase crop competition, aiming for 500 seeds/sq m with mid-October drilling.
7 Long-term view
Finally, Mr Wormell says it can be a battle. “Every decision you make on cropping and rotation is driven by its 
impact on ryegrass.
“It is a long-term approach and you need to keep confusing the weed. What the weed likes is repeated min-till, 
repeated winter cropping and the same chemistry,” he says.
Survey reveals worsening situation
A survey of UK growers reveals that 60% have a ryegrass problem and one-third said the situation is getting worse.
“Ryegrass has typically been viewed as the lesser problem to blackgrass,” says Syngenta grass weed manager Cat 
Gray.
“But we know that it is both more competitive to cereal crops and is getting increasingly difficult to control.
The Syngenta State of the Nation survey also revealed that 17% of growers were starting to see the benefits of an 
integrated crop management (ICM) approach.
However, only 10% felt they had it well under control with significant improvements.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Of the integrated measures deployed by growers, spraying off heavily infested crop patches was viewed as the 
most effective control option, followed by more spring cropping.
Increased herbicide stacking was also seen as an effective measure (45%).
Ryegrass focus site
Syngenta’s newly established Ryegrass Focus Site, in Yorkshire is investigating different per-emergence 
sequences and stacks.
One early observation is that farmers can still get good control with the right pre-emergence hit.
“The pre-emergence Defy (prosulfocarb) stack, in combination with flufenecet and diflufenican, achieved over 95% 
ryegrass control in a challenging infestation," says Syngenta’s Cat Gray.
Other factors being investigated at the site include seed rates and rotations including the possible role of hybrid 
barleys.
She adds that they are also looking at row orientation, drilling east/west versus north/south, as there is more 
shading of weeds between rows.
This combined with growing competitive winter barley plus narrower row spacings could help crops outcompete the 
weed.

A farmer has been ordered to pay almost £30,000 after a friend who was working for him died when he fell through 
a cowshed roof.
Robert Latham, 64, of Knolton Farm, Overton, near Wrexham, pleaded guilty to a breach of health and safety 
regulations following the incident on 19 July last year. 
David Alan Rees, 56, of Ruabon, was fatally injured while he was clearing out moss from a gutter at Knolton Farm, 
North East Wales Magistrates’ Court at Mold was told.

Mr Rees fell from a ladder to the floor of the cowshed under the sky light. An ambulance was sent to the scene, 
which took him to hospital, but he died from his injuries.
An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found Mr Latham failed to plan the work at height and 
did not have any suitable equipment available to do the work safely.
There were no measures in place to prevent Mr Rees falling from the roof or through the skylight.

James Buchanan, defending, told the court it was a “genuinely tragic case”. His client “thought he had a safe 
system of work in place. He didn’t”.
Mr Latham pleaded guilty to breaching section 3(2) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. He was fined 
£26,000 and has also been ordered to pay costs of £3,922.60 and a surcharge of £170.
Speaking after the case, HSE inspector Mhairi Duffy said: “There are no winners in this tragic case.

It seems like it has been almost spring for weeks now, but regularly we have had a cold snap and as a result the

It is now finally in full flower and the countryside is looking its best, with vivid yellow and green fields and blue skies.

One feature that has not changed is the very dry soil and we really need to keep getting regular rain to keep crops 
growing to their full potential.
I can’t believe that for a second year in a row we are already looking for rain.
I think the farm looks at its best during late May, with fresh green growth and new leaves on the trees.
Hopefully it will not be spoiled again by drought stress burning off all the sandy patches even before ear 
emergence.
As a result of the dry conditions I have reduced nitrogen inputs to malting barley and have been going earlier with 
micronutrient applications on all crops.
Tissue sampling has shown that to date we seem to be keeping on top of the plants’ requirement.
I am trialling various combinations of copper and zinc seed treatments in the spring barley this year, in addition to 
the manganese that we apply as a routine.
As yet there is no visual difference, but I will tissue sample prior to foliar treatment, and ultimately the combine yield 
monitor will be the judge of any benefit.
Looking ahead
With cattle now outside and drilling complete, I am now starting to plan ahead for the coming season.
With grain prices in retreat, the cost of fertiliser will be a key factor in the returns to be made from the coming 
seasons' crops.
As yet there is no indication of new season pricing, but a reduction in price from this season will be needed to make 
winter barley in particular an attractive crop to grow, although it will retain a place in the rotation on a modest scale 
to give an early entry to OSR.

We have been breaking a substantial tonnage of rock out of one side of where the cubicle building is to be situated, 
all of which has been perfect for levelling the site and hardening any softer spots in the ground.
We now have only five ewes left to lamb. It has been a great spring for lambing outside, with barely a wet day, and 
the early spring has provided us with ample grass for the ewes. We are just in the process of tagging and tailing

Lambing was a pleasure; there you are, I said it out loud!
I am down to my last three to lamb and things have gone well in the lambing shed. I had the normal disasters at the 
start, which can really get you down and those small losses can seem huge.
But most of the ewes lambed in the first two weeks, with only 19 left out of the 220 at the start of week three. Ewes 
were fit going into lambing, which had concerned me, but the expected problems didn’t materialise.
I have made a number of changes to my sheep enterprise this year and I’m not sure if it was all or one in particular 
that made the difference, or was it just the kind winter?
Was it that the ewes were bolused earlier prior to lambing? I had been told by a friend that getting the cobalt right in 
the weeks before lambing can make a big difference to lamb survival, so I bolused five weeks before lambing, 
which was much earlier than last year.
Or was it that I condition scored more regularly with any triplets and leaner ewes getting the best grass? Or was it 
that I changed the way I fed the molasses?
This year, I had two watering cans and I ran along the feeders before I put in the soya-based feed.
So was it just the kinder winter? I’m not sure, but I know my ewe and lamb mortality is down and lambs were 
certainly more willing to survive.
Now for stage two – fat, fit and ready! 
Last year, I introduced red clover to my new swards and the growth this spring has been phenomenal. So far, all the 
grazing grass has just had 135kg/ha of 10-26-26 with sulphur and no additional N.
But yesterday, I had to close up part of the sheep-allocated area for silage as it was getting past them.

Here in Cornwall our potato planting was finished in good time. Soil conditions were generally good although they 
have taken a while to warm up.
Having said that, the earliest planted have grown away well and look about on target.
The majority of the area has emerged and our blight control programme is under way.

I spent an extremely enjoyable evening recently courtesy of one of our local agrochemical distributors where the 
latest thoughts on blight-control programmes were shared.
As is the case in most seasons, we will need to modify what we do slightly in order to keep on top of what can be a 
huge issue for us.
It is possibly something where genetic modification could have a role to play in future but I feel that is a very long 
way off.
With that job out of the way we have turned to making silage for the cattle. Given the spread-out location of our 
grass, we operate a simple but flexible system of round bales.
We have all our own grassland kit but it’s fair to say that I haven’t invested very heavily.
However, it works and it doesn’t take that long to get the job done.
Weather concerns
In between times we have started to dust down the irrigation equipment. If we don’t get a good soak soon I feel we 
will need to be pumping water.
Some showers along the way and a generally cool run of temperatures mean that there is still some reasonable soil 
moisture present.
However, there are regular patterns of high pressure on the weather charts, which are making me feel twitchy.
The onions are in greatest need and I am also tempted to water some of the daffodil bulbs.
Rainfall or the lack of it over the next couple of months could be crucial to the success or otherwise of crops here 
this season.
Finally, it is farm walk time. I’ve been to a couple so far but we also have a few to host.
Consequently we need to get the brush and shovel out and have a general tidy up so we can pretend that the place 
always looks just so!

The Charolais sale at Welshpool was good and bad. Our much-admired bull stood first in his class, but at the last 
second the judge changed him to second. At least he sold really well! 
Unfortunately, we brought some home due to a lack of interest at the right price. So, we have some excellent easy 
calving bulls if anyone is interested? The Simmental sale at Worcester was well supported with a lot of females 
attracting a large crowd. 
The late spring sale means purchasers usually turn their new bulls straight out with cows. I was happy how fit our 
two bulls were, and two were put to work straight after the sale. Shearing has started with the rams and empty ewe

We were just settling into another round – I had finished my peanut frenzy, so it must have been after the second 
round – and talk turned to the Basic Payment. “Got yours done yet?” asked Robert.
“Yup,” I replied. “Easier than ever this year. Especially now that nitrogen-fixing crops count even more towards the 
Environmental Focus Area. Easy peas-y.”
“Really?” said Robert, with a curious expression you only see on the face of old, wise farmers when they’re talking 
to idiot younger farmers.
It’s similar to the look when his pickled egg has gone down the wrong way – but subtly different. “Are you not going 
to spray any of them, then?”
Bombshell moment
Ah. That was the bombshell moment. I realised, mid-pint of Perridges, that I had completely and utterly messed up 
my BPS application. Somehow, the basic rule that legumes can only apply towards your EFA if they were 
completely unsprayed had gone right over my head.
Any excuses? None, M’Lud – save perhaps for the fact that having changed all the land use codes, I "generated" a 
new application form, and it said "EFA met". Not much of an excuse, but it’ll have to do.
I checked my now-semi-approved phone: it was 14 May. I had one day (as Time Team nearly said) to get the forms 
sorted. Where do you start again, having submitted and signed off your BPS form? Oh well, I thought, as we 
launched into another round, that’s for tomorrow.
The climate catastrophe sent us yet another stunning early summer morning, so leaping out of bed very early to 
start BPS paperwork was an absolute joy.
By the time the Malinois had noisily interrupted Mr Fox’s morning stroll across the orchard, my list of queries for the 
RPA helpline was ready: how do I start again?
Beans 0, hedges 1
How do I "lose" peas/beans from my EFA? And how do I use instead the multitude of previously "unused" hedges if 
the RPA’s maps say they don’t exist? Unfortunately, the RPA didn’t open for an hour.
At 8.31am, I was number 24 in the phone queue – estimated waiting time, 37 minutes. Hazel and I took it in turns to 
endure the hideously edited loop of classical music, until, suddenly, at 9.05am, I was at the front of the queue. By 
9.06am, I was chatting to a cheerful and fantastically patient RPA person.
Her answers were: just create a new application (they take the "latest" one, come midnight); click on "declare less 
EFA" and remove the legumes, and as for the hedges: measure them using the mapping tool, declare them on 
"land use", and send in a sketch map and an RLE1.
So we did. It’s wasn’t hard, but it was long-winded. Almost every field is bordered with hedges and lines of trees, so 
our target was reached very quickly. Just before noon on 15 May, I clicked submit – again.
My new application was "accepted". Shortly after lunch, I was back out in the sprayer – in the beans. Funny old 
game, 21st-century farming.

Expert market insight from senior commodity analyst, Peter Meehan, INTL FCStone
Global price action for dairy commodities has been somewhat mixed in recent weeks. European dairy commodity 
prices have behaved in a similar manner as SMP and butter continue to move in opposite directions.
The European SMP quotation pushed higher in recent weeks, while EEX SMP futures also saw gains. The 
European butter quotation, on the other hand, along with EEX butter futures have both continued to edge lower 
since the start of May.
European SMP exports hit a record 90,000t in March (+31%), while exports of butter (-24%); cheese (-6%) and 
infant milk formula (-7%) struggled to keep pace with last year.
Looking at milk supply, European production is set to climb back ahead of last year for March, with strong gains for 
Germany (+1.2%); the UK (+4.1%); Ireland (+11.2%) and Denmark (+3.0%) more than offsetting declines for 
France (-0.8%) and the Netherlands (-2.4%).
Weaker production in New Zealand (-8.3%), Australia (-10.7%), the US (-0.6%) and Argentina (-8.0%), however, 
will pull combined milk production for the top dairy-exporting countries into negative territory for March.

unit near Shaftesbury, Dorset.
The farm rears more than 800 calves a year which are marketed and sold privately.
Breeds used are mainly Aberdeen Angus, Hereford or British Blue steers and bought-in by a specialist buyer at one 
to three weeks old in batches of 10-12.
Despite already being a high-welfare unit, achieving strong results, the farm has looked to improve through a 
process of continual fine-tuning and management tweaks.

Dengrove Farm Facts
Mixed 115ha arable and calf rearing unit
830 mainly Aberdeen Angus or Hereford calves reared a year
Calves weaned at two months, 11 days earlier
Calf jackets cut milk powder intakes by100g/calf/day
Growth rates improved by 15%
Weaning weights increased from 75kg to 86kg average
Calves sold privately at 125kg, about four months, 16 days earlier
Straw use cut by 1-1.5 D1000 bales a week
Antibiotic use cut by 8%
One such event was Farmers Weekly’s Rethinking Cattle Performance workshop supported by Zoetis, Volac and 
XL Vets.
Dom attended one of the farm-based workshops in November 2018.
“Since the workshop I’ve changed the milk powder, invested in calf jackets, switched disinfectants and tackled 
housing ventilation,” he says.
Together, the improvements have helped raise average weaning weights by 15% from 75kg to about 86kg. 
Weaning takes place over 10 days with milk stepped down from 2.5l/calf/day to 1.25l/calf/day.
The weaning date is flexible and takes place once calves are eating 2kg of concentrate a day, usually at two 
months old.The improvements mean calves develop faster and weaning has been brought forward by 11 days.
Improved growth is maintained with a 16-day reduction in time to reach the 125kg sale weight at about four months.
Cleaning and disinfection
Ahead of the calves’ arrival, Stephen and Dom already had a rigorous cleaning and disinfection procedure.
All metalwork is dismantled and removed from the young calf housing and thoroughly steam cleaned, pressure-
washed and disinfected.
But a workshop tip was to be more selective when choosing disinfectants.
“After discussions with the vet we added the disinfectant Kenocox to the cleaning regime,” says Dom.
The product has an increased action on surfaces against endoparasites such as Cryptosporidium parcum, 
coccidiosis and bacterial infections which are all persistent, major threats to calf performance.
Once the metalwork is back in place it is given a second application of Kenocox which is applied using a knapsack 
sprayer.The cousins also tackled the surfaces and drainage in the housing.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
“Floor surfaces have been improved with a slightly steeper gradient to increase the run-off,” explains Stephen.
Since the changes, flooring and bedding are drier and air moisture levels have been cut.
This reduces the disease challenge from bugs harboured by wet bedding and in the moist air. And, because 
bedding stays drier, straw use has been reduced by 1 – 1.5 D1000 bales each week.
Pen management
Previously young calves were kept in individual pens but a switch to group pens has been introduced to reduce 
stress.
“We opted for pens of three with boards erected to prevent any spread of disease between pens,” he explains.
Calves have taken to the system well and are quiet and calm. There has also been less duplication of tasks with 
fewer structures and metalwork to clean and disinfect.
Health and nutrition
On arrival the calves are checked over, weighed and given Rehydion - an electrolyte gel added to the milk. Adding 
the electrolyte to the milk in a gel form means there is less of a growth check compared to offering calves a water-
mixed electrolyte solution.
The milk powder offered is one major improvement area.
“Although the farm didn’t have a problem with scouring animals some were looser than we wanted, with some 
obvious dirty back ends,” says Stephen.
“We focused on the milk because it was the major feed source and it revealed a high content of wheat flour and ash 
making it harder to digest.”
The cousins reviewed nine types of milk powder with a nutritionist and opted for one with a lower inclusion rate of 
straight wheat flour.
Instead it contains hydrolysed wheat gluten which helps to improve digestibility. It also boasts a much higher 
inclusion rate of vitamin E at 500ug compared to 100ug in the previous brand.
The aim of the higher vitamin E was to boost the calves’ natural immunity, helping them to better resist disease. 
The cost of the switch compared to the benefit gained was negligible.
The previous milk powder was about £1,500/t.
“The improved powder is £1,535 so for just £35/t extra we have solved the issues we had and seen growth rates 
improve,” says Stephen.
Once weaned, the animals continue their development on a tailored blend of home-grown barley, soya, rapemeal 
and molasses which is mixed on the farm.
Calves are offered the mix in small amounts from arrival with a gradual increase up to weaning.
Calf Jackets
Another simple piece of advice gained at the Rethinking Cattle Performance workshop was to use calf jackets.
Any young calf is vulnerable to being chilled in the early days of its life. That adds to stress, lowers its immune 
system and means it is using energy to maintain its body temperature rather than to grow.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Dom bought 60 second-hand jackets for £3 each at a dispersal sale.
“The benefits since then have made them an extremely good investment, with fewer infections, growth checks and 
about 100g less milk powder used per calf per day when outside temperatures drop to 0c.
Ventilation
“At the workshop I watched the smoke machine demonstration which prompted me to consider the calves’ 
environment,” Dom says.
“Since then we have made changes to the shed to keep the calves warmer, while retaining air movement,” he says.
Previously the building sides were open and the air sock ventilation system ran at top speed.
However, while this provided good airflow, the temperature was too low and calves were exposed to draughts.
To solve the issue, five-foot high block walls were built with ventilated metal sheeting added above this to allow air 
in without creating draughts at calf height.
“Since the workshop we monitor the airflow and temperatures more closely and adjust the fanspeed to the 
conditions,” Stephen notes.
Once the calves leave the pens they are moved into a large barn.This barn has also been upgraded with new 
ventilation panels added at the sides to improve airflow and restrict draughts.
Air moisture has been cut and, along with it, the amount of antibiotic treatment needed to treat diseases has also 
been reduced by about 8%, Dom believes.
“Together, all of the tweaks we have introduced have added up to a significant improvement. “We are pleased with 
the progress we are making but, we won’t stop here – we will look to continually research and review and keep on 
improving,” says Dom.

Mild acidification of slurry is a solution to help pig farmers meet targets to reduce ammonia emissions, as outlined in 
the government's Clean Air Strategy launched earlier this year.
The strategy sets a target of reducing ammonia levels by 8% by 2020 (on 2005 baseline) and 16% by 2030.
Pig producers are already working to reduce emissions, with low-protein feeding generally applied.
However, pig farmers should be exploring other options to help reduce ammonia levels and meet the targets, 
explained independent consultant Nigel Penlington.
See also: The Clean Air Strategy
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Options for lowering ammonia emissions on pig farms include:
Part-slatted floors – can reduce emissions by up to 35%
Slurry cooling – can reduce emissions by up to 55%
Air cleaning – up to 80% of ammonia can be removed but generally very expensive to run
Dilution using high-speed fans
Mild acidification of slurry – can reduce emissions by up to 67%
Mr Penlington said: “The Clean Air strategy is a huge juggernaut coming down the road for the industry.
"For many farmers, investment in some technology to reduce ammonia emissions may be the only way they can 
grow their business.
"Mild acidification of slurry and high-speed fans are generally a solution for a lot of pig farmers,” he said.
How mild acidification works
Mild acidification works by dropping the pH of the slurry to below 6.
When the pH is less than 6, the chemical reaction stops and ammonia is changed to ammonium, which doesn’t 
evaporate.
What studies looking at mild acidification have found
Increased growth rates of 20g/day from weaning to bacon weight
Increased feed conversion by 4%
Improvement in the quality of the slurry leading to a 0.5t/ha increase in wheat yields
Reduced fertiliser costs due to better quality slurry
Reduced repair bills as ammonia is corrosive
Reduced fly levels
The easiest way to acidify slurry is in the pig housing as it can also improve air quality in the building for pigs and 
staff.  
Slurry is pumped directly from the housing into a processing tank, where sulphuric acid is automatically added.
The dosage is controlled by pH sensors. The treated slurry is then pumped into the storage tank and back into the 
housing.
Farmer reaction
Pig producer Sam Godfrey, from Lincolnshire, manages 6,500 sows and is one of the first producers to install a mild 
acidification system.
He has installed three so far across different sites and has started work to acidify slurry on a further three sites.
The first systems were up and running in February this year and already he noted an anecdotal improvement in the 
air quality in the pig housing.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
He said: “There seems to be less ammonia in the buildings and the pigs are coughing less.
"We are still waiting on the weights from the first batch finished since installing it, but they looked good,” he said.
Before installing the system, Mr Godfrey visited Denmark, where 20% of all slurry is acidified prior to land 
application.
“Legislation is encouraging us to reduce ammonia levels, so we have to look at ways to do this.
"Mild acidification has lots of benefits to pig health, improvement to the quality of the slurry, improving atmosphere 
in the buildings and reducing fertiliser costs.“
The biggest drawback is the capital outlay, explained Mr Godfrey.
“You are looking at a six-figure sum for the system, pipework, slurry separator and mixing tank.
"It can be difficult to retrofit, which is why we have installed a slurry separator for a better flow through the existing 
pipework.
"There are additional costs to factor in such as electricity and sulphuric acid.”
Mr Godfrey received a 40% grant under the Countryside Productivity Scheme to help fund the systems.

Challenging grazing conditions posed by Cotswold brash stony soils that climb up to steep inclines of 750ft make 
running a low-input, grass-based system untenable at Church Farm in North Stoke.
In response, farm manager Kevin Harrison has prescribed a high-input, high-output system reliant on creep feeding 
lambs.
Despite having higher feed costs than grass-based sheep systems, Mr Harrison’s attention to detail is delivering 1.8 
lambs sold per ewe, which in turn is bringing returns of £150 a ewe.
Breeding
Replacement ewes are sourced at six months of age from a single, known farm in Wensleydale, Yorkshire.

On arrival, lambs receive a broad-spectrum wormer and fluke treatment and will start a vaccine programme for 
pasteurella, clostridial disease and enzootic abortion.
Sufftex rams are used at a high ram-to-ewe ratio of about 1:40 for six weeks, with the raddle changed weekly for 
the first three weeks to allow Mr Harrison to group ewes accordingly at lambing.
“On the third week I put a red on to show any returns because we get very few anyway.”
Ewes are housed at Christmas after scanning and are winter shorn. They are then grouped into singles, twins and 
triplets according to body condition and lambing date.  
“Winter shearing is much better for them because they are inside and it’s warmer, and they eat more and you can 
monitor condition better. But if a ewe is lean we won’t shear her because she’ll get cold. There were 20 we didn’t 
shear this year.”
Ewes are fed straw and nuts on the floor inside pens and they forage in the straw bedding to find it.
Not only does this avoid ewes pushing at the feed fence, but you would struggle to find a single nut wasted, Mr 
Harrison says.
Straw is used from the arable enterprise and is a cost-effective alternative to making silage bales, which is why the 
farm switched to feeding straw many years ago.
The team beds up after feeding nuts, with ewes receiving 1.5-2kg of straw a head, with about 50% wasted as 
bedding.
“The beauty of that is they are always lambing into a clean environment.”
Initially nuts are fed at a flat rate of 0.75kg in two feeds and this is stepped up to 1kg a head a day three weeks 
before lambing, depending on body condition.
“It puts condition on the ewes early because on a straw-fed system they can melt away quite quickly near lambing. 
You have more chance of trying to put condition on them early rather than try and chase it nearer lambing,” says Mr 
Harrison, who targets a body condition score of 2.5 at lambing.
Mr Harrison puts achieving 1.8 lambs per ewe sold down to his focus on ewe condition and says creep feeding 
lambs allows him to wean early and get ewes back in condition ahead of tupping, with lambs typically weaned at 
10-12 weeks.
Lambing
A compact lambing period sees ewes lamb over three weeks from the second week of March.
The higher-cost system is reliant on having a high number of lambs to sell so attention to detail at lambing is 
imperative.
Mr Harrison is a one-man band for most of the year, with staff brought in to help at lambing. Farming on the urban 
fringe between Bristol and Bath means finding good staff can be quite difficult, so lambing was pushed back by one 
week this year to accommodate veterinary students outside of term time.
Five staff members will cover the busiest period, with raddles used at mating to gauge which weeks this will be, and 
the team is allocated day and night shifts.
With scanning results averaging 200% overall, triplets are inevitable, and every care is taken to adopt these lambs 
on to singles where possible, with remaining lambs put on to an automatic milk feeder.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
“We use a big plastic bucket and we lamb the ewe into it and catch all the fluid inside,” he explains. This allows 
surplus lambs to be wet-adopted on to single ewes.
“Two minutes can save a ewe going in a crate. I hate crates,” he says.
“When they are lambing, we will wait and then put a couple of gates around them to stop mis-mothering. Once 
she’s had her last lamb they will get moved into an individual pen.”
Generally, assistance is kept to a minimum, especially with shearlings which can naturally be more nervous.
Once penned up, a refractometer is used to check the ewe’s colostrum quality and if it’s not over 22% on the Brix 
scale lambs will be given an antibiotic drench as a precaution.
“We are just treating the ones that are high-risk. We’re not eliminating antibiotic use completely but we are using 
less.”
EID is used for monitoring lamb growth rates and medicine use, but a simple spray marker system is used to 
identify ewes not to breed from.
“If a ewe has a prolapse, ring womb or big teats they get a big red cross on their backside and they are culled.”
Grazing challenges
Ewes are generally turned out to grass with lambs at foot 24 hours after lambing and set stocked in smaller groups 
of up to 130.
Throughout the grazing season faecal egg counts are monitored, with results guiding treatment plans.
“In the past we have done resistance testing and found mild resistance to white and clear wormers so that only 
leaves us with yellow wormers, but they have a longer withdrawal period of 21 days so you have to be careful once 
you start drawing and we have to choose from the remaining wormers wisely.”

Once at grass, lambs are fed 18% crude protein creep in hoppers from two weeks of age onwards.
Creep feeding is necessary to counter the farm’s poor grass growth, with most of the ground south-facing, which 
means it is prone to burning off in the summer, Mr Harrison explains.
“We are trying to get a lowland performance out of an upland farm. It’s almost a mini bit of Wales but in Somerset.
“Rotational grazing doesn’t fit our system. I’ve been here 19 years now and I know what works. We tried not creep 
feeding and had all store lambs at the end of it.”
Lambs are weaned at about 12 weeks and weigh 37kg on average, with all lambs sold direct to Randall Parker 
weighing 20.5kg deadweight at R3L/R3H.

“I am aware of our reliance on feed and rising input costs but you have to make the most of what you have got to 
work with and be as efficient as possible,” Mr Harrison says. “If you are on a farm with good grass growing 
conditions and good pastures with breeds that can convert that grass well, then grazing systems are ideal.”
Mr Harrison says he would love to be able to reduce the flock’s feed costs without affecting performance, but he 
doesn’t see how this would be possible without losing arable income to make way for forage crops or drastically 
reducing ewe numbers by relying solely on a grass-fed system on permanent pasture.
“The whole low-input low-output versus high-input high-output debate is always an interesting conversation with 
other sheep farmers. We all do what we think is best for our flocks and businesses.
“We have to maximise our output on what we have.
“Our system can come with high costs, it can have high risks such as the volatility of lamb prices but when it comes 
right it works well. We are achieving a lowland flock performance on a hill farm.”

It's easy to assume that new trailers come with tuned-up, highly efficient braking kits, but farm manager Jim Scarratt 
found a very different result when he ran his up-to-date load luggers over a rolling road.
He was keen to make sure that his fleet was working at peak braking efficiency, having seen tractor and trailer 
combinations involved in several high-profile collisions over recent years.
Even before Mr Scarratt became manager at Grange Farm in Norfolk 12 years ago, all the trailers received a yearly 
once-over before harvest by local engineering firm CJ Wortley and Son.
“We annually spend up to £1,000 a trailer on brakes, lights, hoses, tyres and anything else that needs attention. It's 
a case of if it’s broken, fix it.”
The reason for this close maintenance regime is that the farm hauls a serious amount of produce, mainly via small, 
local roads. In total, the 1,100ha enterprise shifts around 16,000t of potatoes and sugar beet, 5,000t of digestate 
and 4,000t of grain.
“The fleet consists of 14t and 16t Richard Western and Marston trailers and is in use for most of the year. It's not 
always with the same operator towing them, though, so a bit of expense in the close season can reduce 
unnecessary downtime during harvest.”
Mr Scarratt's five full-time employees alert him straight away to blown bulbs or tyre bulges and it is due to this 
meticulous attention to detail that the farm still runs trailers that were built almost 30 years ago.

Despite a fastidious maintenance regime, Mr Scarratt wasn’t satisfied with just replacing broken parts. In light of a 
spate of recent accidents, he wanted to be sure the anchors of his laden rigs were working at peak efficiency when 
called into action.
A second local engineering company, JM Ayres and Son, hires in a portable rolling road machine for about 10 days 
every year to offer the local farming community a chance to find out exactly what sort of shape their trailers' brakes 
are in.
The road is a freestanding unit made by Dutch specialist BM Autoteknik and can be positioned for use on any patch 
of level ground, provided there is a three-phase power supply. It takes approximately 10 minutes to get the road set 
up before it can test axles weighing up to 20t.
Purchase cost for one of these rigs is upwards of £60,000 – so most firms will be looking to rent rather than buy – 
and second-hand values won’t leave you much change from £30,000.
Testing process
Having the test facility nearby was an opportunity not to be missed for Grange Farm's trailer fleet.
The process involves towing each trailer onto the rolling road, with the two axles tested separately. A couple of full 
IBCs are put in the rear of the trailers to keep them seated on the rollers as the pressure is applied.
The whole process takes about 30 minutes a trailer and there are strict guidelines that determine a pass or fail.
For trailers being towed by a 40kph tractor, a braking efficiency of 25% is required to pass on both axles, with the 
force gradually applied via the rollers to gauge the effectiveness of the brakes. Impressively, it can all be controlled 
by laptop and doesn’t need anyone sat in the tractor cab.
A 50kph trailer running air brakes requires a 45% braking efficiency, and all handbrakes need to be a minimum of 
16% effective.
All six trailers were put on the road – from the oldest 1991 model to the most recent 2016 – with handbrakes also 
tested.
Surprising results
"The scariest part of the experience was that all of our trailers – regardless of age – failed the handbrake test, with 
two also failing on axle braking."
“Between the trailers there are various types of handbrakes, from ratchet to wind-up, and some were as little as 8% 
effective. We had no idea they were so bad – it’s lucky we're in flat Norfolk, but it’s still no excuse for them to not 
work," he says.
To add to Mr Scarratt's surprise, it was actually the newest trailer that failed on the axle braking.
The trailers were then taken back to the farm for minor repairs and tweaks prior to a retest. Most were simple fixes 
– mainly tightened cables and the like – but one trailer had its small 20mm rams increased to larger ones to up the 
pressure.
Once passed, each trailer receives a printed certificate with serial number, date and time of test, along with exact 
details of braking efficiencies. This means Mr Scarratt has a record of exactly how each trailer has performed and 
knows which ones to keep an eye on throughout the year.
It works out at roughly £100 a trailer once the repairs have been taken into consideration.

“It’s a small price for the peace of mind that our kit is up to scratch and the safety and wellbeing of our staff and the 
public is in check.
“There is no doubt in my mind that we’ll be doing this every year.”
Improving tractor and trailer safety
Agriculture has had its fair share of bad publicity over the past few years relating to ineffective trailer brakes. The 
highest-profile case involved a Cambridgeshire contractor being fined £400,000 for being in breach of health and 
safety rules after an employee was killed due to the trailer’s brakes being poorly maintained.
In light of this, the "Tilly Your Trailer" campaign was set up by one of the casualties’ families to promote trailer 
maintenance to farmers and operators to prevent such an atrocity happening again.
It involves an 18-point inspection procedure and certificate for agricultural trailers weighing 10t or more and 
incorporates an annual service by an authorised mechanic, as well as a simple daily check each time a trailer is 
used on or off the farm.
It has won the support of trailer manufacturers, machinery dealers, safety experts and the police – as well as 
farmers. Some 70 authorised agricultural depots throughout the country are now annually inspecting trailers to the 
Tilly Pass standard.
These trailers are certified and display a numbered Tilly (sticker) on their tailgate.
The Tilly is dated and its unique number recorded, along with the chassis number, on an inspection sheet and 
central database, creating a paper trail for every trailer.
New trailers entering the agricultural workplace through an authorised depot will receive a Tilly Pass, too – creating 
a log of maintenance for the trailer’s life.

Operating high health pig herds and keeping stress levels low is preventing tail biting in non-docked Finnish pigs.
In Finland, they have been operating 100% pigs finished with non-docked tails for many years.
Although routine tail docking is prohibited in the EU, 95-99% of pigs in Europe are still docked.
Speaking at the Pigs Tomorrow conference, pig vet Taneli Tirkkonen, of Atria Pork, the largest pig processor in 
Finland, puts the success of running systems with non-docked tails down to good health, larger-than-average pen 
sizes and adequate feeding and drinking space, which keeps stress levels low.
See also: 4 early signs of tail biting to watch for on pig farms
He said the incidence of tail-bitten pigs seen on the slaughter line was about 2.5%, but could be nearer to 4%.
Average mortality from birth to slaughter is 2%, with a very small proportion (0.3% or lower) due to tail biting.
He said managing tail biting comes down to strict management.
“At Atria Pork, our systems are almost totally integrated.
"We have our own genetics, feed mills, produce all the pigs, slaughter them and then sell to the consumer.
"Our biggest finisher has more than 15,000 pigs.”
Below are factors he said are important in keeping stress levels low:
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Above-average drink and feeding space. Most pigs are on a restricted liquid feed and all pigs can eat at the same 
time. This removes competition at feeders. They have 32-35cm trough space a pig. Pigs are fed three to six times a 
day. There is also more than average drinker space, with one drinker for every 10 pigs.
Space per pigs for weaners is 0.4sq m and 0.9sq m for finishers, with almost all on partly slatted floors (at least a 
third slatted).
Enrichment material in all pens.
Consistent nutritional quality of feed, mainly from distillery by-products, with very little soya.
Excellent animal health. Producers don’t need to vaccinate for many things as they have eradicated disease and 
have a zero tolerance to salmonella.
All of Atria Pork farms are signed up to a national porcine quality system, called Sikava, which secures animal 
health and food safety and goes beyond EU and national legislation. Across the herds in Finland, 99% are specific 
pathogen free (SPF) and are negative for PRRS, salmonella, Aujetzky, Sarcoptic mange, Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae, swine dysentery and atrophic rhinitis.

Consumer demand for eggs and poultrymeat have risen steadily over the past 10 years. Buoyant markets have 
already prompted hundreds of farmers to diversify into broiler and free-range egg production.
But what does it take to set up, and is now the right time, amid serious concerns and warnings of oversupply – 
particularly in the egg sector?
See also: Why young farmers should consider getting into poultry
Eggs
Market outlook
Free-range egg consumption has risen by 5-6% a year for the past four or five years and forecasts suggest demand 
will continue to grow. But the sector looks like a victim of its own success.
Figures collated by the British Free Range Egg Producers Association (Bfrepa) show that production has rocketed 
from 15 million hens to 25 million since 2013.
The rate of growth has accelerated in the past three years, largely driven by diversifications that have seen the 
number of new units rise 12% a year since 2016, says Bfrepa chief executive Robert Gooch.
Farmers concerned about financial support after Brexit view the sector, which survives without subsidies, as a more 
dependable venture.
The regular income and lower volatility have resulted in huge growth in free-range numbers within traditional dairy 
areas, such as Wales and the west of England.
But the increase in supply has seen farmgate prices drop from about 98p/doz in early 2015 to 79.1p/doz in the first 
quarter of this year.
The drop has slashed profits and many farms, particularly where builds have been funded with bank finance, are 
finding it tough going.
Free-range development tips 
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Use realistic costs for cashflow budgets
Ensure energy prices are known – sophisticated ventilation systems use more electricity
Make sure you budget for feed price increases
Remember about 30% of eggs will be medium-sized or smaller and will achieve lower prices
Install energy-efficient LED lighting
Factor in vet and medicine costs
Allow a budget for range enrichment items.
Marketing
The first step in developing a free-range egg enterprise is to assess the market for the produce and, right now, the 
market is in a bad place, Mr Gooch says.
Contracts are largely based on a guarantee to take a farm’s produce, but not at a fixed price, so the business will be 
exposed to any declines. 
Egg packer LJ Fairburn, which takes produce from almost 60 units in the north-east of England, confirms that the 
market is well supplied.
National production manager John Holt says that although demand has grown, the influx of entrants means supply 
exceeds demand.
“We are not looking for any new producers yet but demand is forecast to keep growing long-term and we may see 
equilibrium return,” Mr Holt says.
Anyone who wants to proceed should do so only with a firm written contract, he warns.
Planning
Before embarking on a development, check with Defra which locations carry a high risk of avian influenza and avoid 
these areas.
The location of a proposed unit will also have a bearing on whether the application is likely to gain approval with the 
local planning department.
Local councils have differing agendas and policies towards new poultry units, Bfrepa warns. The organisation 
collates data on planning to show where sheds are being put up and where they are coming down.
Nick Williams of chartered surveyor Berrys agrees that location and site selection are key. Ammonia and protected 
sites for wildlife or historical value are hot topics within planning departments, Mr Williams suggests.
He advises engaging with the Local Planning Authority early to give the project the best chance of success.
Within the planning process there are a number of potential challenges that must be met.
An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is required if the proposal is for 85,000 places for broilers or 60,000 
places for hens, Mr Williams says.
Even below these thresholds a screening opinion should be sought as to whether an EIA is required by the 
authority.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
The site will also require an Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) permit from the Environment 
Agency if stock numbers are above a 40,000-bird threshold.
Construction
Prospective producers must base their calculations on realistic figures, says Bfrepa chairman James Baxter.
A 32,000-bird unit will cost about £1.5m to establish and faces losses of about £4 a bird in the current market, 
including finance costs.
If funding is available without borrowing it could still be possible to survive this difficult period.
It is important to cover all costs, not just those of erecting the building. Everything from planning permission and 
consultancy to providing adequate access for vehicles must be considered.
The building should be a robust, multi-tier or flat-deck system that will house birds in a healthy, welfare-friendly 
environment. Beyond the building there are the land costs, fencing for a 16ha range, and enrichment costs.
Suggested construction costs for 32,000-bird unit
Clearspan shed £325,000
Internal equipment £750,000
Concrete £60,000
Contract labour £50,000
Electricity – cabling and high-voltage supply £35,000
Water pipes and tanks £10,000
Excavation, fuel, plant hire £60,000

Case study
Stuart Russell, Claxby Pluckacre, Lincolnshire, 32,000 layers
During a review of his business in early 2017, farmer Stuart Russell decided a diversification would improve his 
resilience if subsidies were abolished after Brexit. 
He began a process of research which involved visiting established producers and discussing the market and 
contract possibilities with local egg packer LJ Fairburn. 
A contract was agreed with Fairburn for the eggs produced and planning for a single 32,000-bird shed began.
Planning permission was submitted in June 2017 but was met with objections. Local villagers were concerned 
about a greenfield site development, odours and additional traffic.
However, the site’s design, the positives of a more resilient business and the extra employment meant the council 
eventually gave the go ahead.

Groundwork began on the sloping site in March 2018 and 8,500t of earth were moved. Construction of a steel clear-
span building, supplied by Morspan, followed.
The design provided two 16,000-bird units under one roof with independent environmental controls. 
Costs were high for the concrete footings, floors and access for articulated lorries. In addition, the building frame 
cost about £250,000 while ventilation, feeders, the control centre and water lines added almost £500,000. 
Beyond the building, 40 acres of range was planted with 2,000 trees. 
In all it is a £1m-plus project, Mr Russell estimates. 
The set-up has been operating since September 2018 and the birds, Bovan Browns supplied by LJ Fairburn, have 
just passed week 50.

Proximity to existing farm buildings
Access to the “strategic” road network

Broilers
Market outlook
The UK slaughters 20 million broilers a week and the total value of the sector is growing by about 3% a year, says 
NFU chief poultry adviser Gary Ford. The total farmgate value of the broiler industry is roughly £1.8bn.
According to market analyst Kantar, volume growth in consumption was about 3.7% for the 12 months to 24 March 
2019.
That means the increase in consumption rates for the period was more than double the 1.6% growth seen in the 52 
weeks to 24 March 2018.
The UK is about 85% self-sufficient in poultrymeat and exports in 2017 totalled £404m, with European countries 
accounting for 80%, or £325m, of those sales. 
In terms of location, the 37,000-strong UK workforce is concentrated in East Anglia and the West Midlands, as well 
as Herefordshire and Shropshire.
More than 90% of broilers are grown to meet Red Tractor standards and the increase in consumption is mainly in 
this type of bird.
Consumers are extremely price sensitive when buying chicken, and higher-welfare RSPCA Freedom Food birds 
account for just 3% of the market.
Sales of Freedom Food chicken have not seen year-on-year growth, says Mr Ford.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Marketing
The first step towards establishing a broiler unit is to contact a nearby processor to establish whether contracts are 
available in the area, Mr Ford says.
Location is of paramount importance, both to limit haulage distances and because some areas are already 
oversupplied.
Most broiler farms (80%) work with a so-called integrator. These firms supply feed and day-old chicks and will take 
all the birds reared at the end of a 37-day production cycle. Payment is based on weight, less any dead birds.
Working with an integrator means there are no upfront costs and output at seven to eight crops a year is good for 
cashflow.
Alternatively an independent can be used, which provides more freedom to negotiate bird and feed costs. But an 
allowance must be made in cashflow planning for bulk-buying of these items.
Consideration should also be given to which assurance scheme is appropriate because stocking rates vary 
between the schemes, Mr Ford points out.
The UK standard allows for 39kg/sq m, Red Tractor assurance is 38kg/sq m while Freedom Food is 30kg/sq m. 
About 90% of birds are produced to Red Tractor standards and most retailers insist upon this as a minimum.
Construction
If the processor provides a letter of intent to take production, discussions with the bank manager should start 
immediately, says Mr Ford. He suggests basing construction estimates on a standard figure of £25/sq ft or £269/sq 
m for units of 2,400sq m.
To meet processor requirements for larger suppliers, units are usually four houses of 50,000 birds each and cost 
roughly £2m.
Broiler units are relatively simple and space-efficient, with a limited area required around the perimeter of each 
house, Mr Ford suggests.
Most newly erected houses are clearspan, steel-framed with plain concrete floors. However, windows for natural 
light must now be included, with an area equivalent to 3% of the floor area.
With a large open space, energy efficiency is key to limiting ongoing costs.
Day-old chicks require temperatures of 33C and an efficient system is necessary to achieve this level of heat. Most 
units opt for renewable heat such as biomass boilers or ground-source heat pumps with a fan system to move the 
warm air and ensure there are no cold spots.
Set-up tips
Get written contracts from processor before you start
Use an experienced planning agent
Don’t overlook service costs on a greenfield site
Allow enough land for ground-source heat pump systems.
Take professional advice at each stage.

Mike Elliott, Cross Lanes near Wrexham, 82,000 broilers unit
Former pig farmer Mike Elliott opted to construct two broiler sheds, housing 41,000 birds each, on a 3.6ha 
greenfield site near Wrexham.
Planners initially rejected the project because of potential emissions and council guidelines which stated that farm 
buildings could only be constructed near existing ones.
However, Mr Elliott had applied for an IPPC permit, and the work to assess and mitigate the unit’s impact helped 
present a successful case at appeal.
After almost three years, construction finally began 14 months ago and all went smoothly.
“We chose to use Powells, a Herefordshire construction company with experience in poultry housing,” he says.
The company erected two clear-span, steel-framed buildings to house 41,000 birds each.
Underfloor heating was installed, fuelled by ground-source heat pumps, and 180 solar panels provide further 
renewable energy.
Ventilation is via side inlets and twelve 1.2m extractor fans at the end of the shed. Short-line feeders and six rows of 
Lubing drinkers are fitted inside the units, which sit on concrete floors and 5cm-deep shavings.
The unit is operated by Mr Elliott's daughter and son-in-law, who have also taken on the considerable burden of the 
finance.
Among the major costs were the groundwork and provision of access for articulated lorries. Overall the unit cost 
about £1.5m plus £200,000 for the land.
The unit is now progressing well through its third crop of broilers, grown for Maelor Foods based in nearby 
Wrexham.

A tribunal hearing has ruled that the ex-wife of farmworker does not have a protected tenancy on her home, as the 
protected status she believed she had was only granted to her former husband and not the couple jointly.
The case, Hook v Hawkins, was heard by the Upper Tribunal Lands Chamber, and was an appeal based on a 
decision made in 2018 by the First-Tier Tribunal (FTT).
The FTT had ruled it did not have the jurisdiction to hear an application concerning a new rent for the property 
under an assured tenancy agreement, because it said the tenant had a protected tenancy dating back to the 1970s, 
not an assured tenancy.
See also: Six property mistakes farmers should avoid
Case history
The Upper Tribunal heard how a farmworker and his wife moved into a rent-free house when he was employed as a 
farmworker by the original landowners in 1975.
The couple lived there until 1990, when they separated. The husband moved out and subsequently left his 
employment.
The wife and their children stayed in the property, remaining on good terms with the landowners, and she was not 
asked for any rent, even after her divorce came through in 1991.
By 1993, she was approached by the original landowners, who said the property was needed for another 
farmworker, but they would find her somewhere else to live.
She was provided with another house at an agreed rent of £200/month.
The tenant and her children did not want to leave the original property, but were reassured that as soon as a 
suitable property became available, they would be informed.
Another, more suitable, property became available in 1995, which she moved into with her family, again paying 
rent.
This property was subsequently sold in 2015, meaning the tenant gained a new landlord, who proposed a change 
in rent levels.
See also: So you want tolet land and property?
The verdict
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
The FTT had taken the view that the original accommodation had been let to the couple, so they were both 
protected tenants and had the scrutiny of tenure and rent control provisions set out in the Rent (Agriculture) Act 
1976 and the Rent Act 1977.
This meant even after the husband’s departure, the tenant had protected status in her own right.
However, following representations from the landlord, the Upper Tribunal concluded that the ex-husband was the 
only protected occupier of the original property under a licence (not a tenancy) and that protection came to an end 
when he left his employment.
The tenant could not enjoy a statutory tenancy in her own right because she had never been a qualifying worker, 
nor had she ever been granted a relevant licence or tenancy.
Nothing was in writing and so there was no evidence of any contract between the tenant and the original 
landowners.
As a result, the judge ruled her status in the original dwelling and that of subsequent accommodation was an 
assured periodic tenancy, as set out within the Housing Act 1988.
Limited landlord power
Simon Beetham, a solicitor with the rural services team of Moore Blatch, said with an assured periodic tenancy the 
tenant would have security in that the landlord would not be able to evict unless there was a breach of one of the 
terms of the tenancy agreement, such as rent arrears or a significant breach of the repairs covenant.
“But the landlord does have more ability to review the rent within an assured tenancy, than perhaps under a 
protected Rent Act tenancy.
"They can serve certain notices and effectively force a rent review. It does gives the landlord a bit more flexibility.”
Mr Beetham warned that the case was not an uncommon one on farms and estates, where workers and family 
members of loyal workers might be offered housing, and it highlighted the importance of taking professional advice 
and making sure everything was put in writing.
“Landlord and tenant law can be very complicated, so making sure you understand what arrangement you are

A farmer faces losing her £2.5m home in a hot-tempered battle with her youngest daughter over the family's 
Somerset 220-acre estate and dairy farm.
Jane Habberfield, 82, "never had a good relationship" with daughter Lucy, 51, who was her late father Frank's 
"blue-eyed girl", London's Appeal Court heard.

his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Jane and daughters Lucy and Sarah – who a judge found "all have a temper" – are facing each other across court 
in a tug-of-war over the valuable family farm near Yeovil.
The legal battle follows a physical fight in a cowshed in 2013 between Lucy and sister Sarah, 53, which led to Lucy 
storming out of the family holding where she had worked since she was a schoolgirl.
Legal battles
Lucy, who had worked long hours on the farm for 30 years – including 80-hour weeks milking cows when she was 
heavily pregnant – subsequently sued her mother, claiming she should have been handed ownership of the farm 
after her father's death in 2014.
Last year a judge ordered Jane to pay Lucy more than £1.1m to compensate her for devoting her life to the farm 
and the cows.
Now mother and daughter are clashing in court again, with Lucy claiming her payout was not big enough and 
should be upped to about £1.6m.
But Jane says her estranged daughter got far too much of the family wealth and wants her share cut to about 
£220,000, to be "fair" to her other children.
Jane also says that if the order made last year stands she will have to sell the farm, losing her home and livelihood 
in her twilight years.
She is being backed by Sarah, who the court heard has had a "tense" relationship with sister Lucy for a long time 
and who she blames for the family's troubles.
The judge found last year that Lucy had been promised by her parents the dairy farm would be hers and had put in 
three decades of back-breaking work on the basis of their assurances.
She began working on the farm when she left school in the early 1980s, earning £40-50 a week, and had taken just 
five weeks' holiday in more than three decades.
The court case continues.
JOURNAL : Farmers Weekly
The importance of protecting and improving the environment is something farmers have always been aware of, but 
public awareness of the issue, and with it the government’s focus, has sharpened over recent years.
In 2018 the government published its 25 Year Environment Plan, setting out how it will deliver on its pledge to leave 
the environment in a better state for the next generation.
Also last year the updated National Planning Policy Framework called for development which enhances the natural 
environment.
See also: Environmental Land Management scheme – what we know so far
A Natural Capital Committee has been tasked with advising the government on the role that the concept plays in 
national life, and 2019 has been designated the Year of Green Action, a drive to help everyone get involved in 
projects that support nature.
All this change brings with it opportunities for farmers and their businesses, including new funding prospects, 
according to experts in the sector.
What is natural capital?
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Natural capital is difficult to define but is generally understood to describe the elements of the environment that 
benefit people.
It can include, for example, clean water, carbon-capturing plants and healthy soils that bring practical  benefits, as 
well as elements with social benefits, such as fresh air and pleasant views, which can aid mental health and 
wellbeing.
Sam Bridgewater, head of wildlife and conservation at Clinton Devon Estates, which owns 10,000ha of land, says 
such assets have both a private and a public value.
Soil has a private value to the farmer, supporting crop production, and a broader value to society, such as carbon 
storage.
Jeremy Clitherow, lead adviser at Natural England, says the concept of natural capital is to assign a value to these 
assets, which do not have a typical value in terms of pounds and pence.
Why is it becoming more prevalent?
Although many farmers will be well aware of the importance of their environmental assets and how to protect them, 
the prevalence of the “natural capital” term and concept has increased alongside the public’s growing awareness of 
the need to improve the environment.
Mr Clitherow says: “There is an increased awareness generally about what impact humans are having on the 
environment on a global scale, as well as a realisation that individuals can do something about it.”
This is a good thing for farmers, Dr Bridgewater says, because it gives them a new vocabulary to demonstrate the 
worth of their work.
It is important to promote at a national and regional level the need to work together on improving and protecting 
natural capital, in order for it to be successful.
“Clearing trees from an area on your farm may make sense based on the timber value, but could result in the 
removal of a natural flood defence,” Dr Bridgewater says.
“We need someone, in government or elsewhere, saying what we want from this area as a whole is, for example, 
food production or flood protection, to ensure the work one person is doing isn’t cancelled out by what someone is 
doing in another area.”
6 examples of natural capital on farms
Natural England’s Jeremy Clitherow is working with the Duchy of Cornwall to help it deliver enhanced natural capital 
on its farms.
When first visiting a farm, Mr Clitherow assesses what natural capital the land has and works with the farmer to 
maintain these assets and improve them.
1. Soil
Determine the soil type and assess the potential risk of run-off. This risk can be mitigated by the cropping type.
2. Water
Discover what water sources are available, how the water flows across the farm, and how it travels across soil into 
habitats. Assess how manure is managed and if slurry lagoons are in place.
3. Biodiversity
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
See what different habitats are in each field parcel. Maintaining and enhancing habitats is important. Wildlife 
corridors can make the land more accessible for wildlife. As the Duchy of Cornwall has connecting farms, Mr 
Clitherow is able to join wildlife areas over a larger area and these farmers are seeing the benefits of working 
together.
4. Recreation and access
Some farmers are keen to invite school and other groups to discuss food production and the environment in 
mutually beneficial access. Many farms will have public bridleways and footpaths and open-access land to assess.
5. Historic environment
This can include a whole range of features, such as Bronze Age tumuli, Iron Age forts, ancient farm buildings, 
historic parklands, beacons and barrows, which need protecting and maintaining.
Some systems can have multiple benefits. For example, traditional orchards can host species-rich grassland and 
pollinators, and then allow grazing later in the year.
6. Landscape
Whether the land has any special designations or not, the whole fabric of the countryside and how it looks from a 
viewpoint is a key asset.
Valuing natural capital
The farmed environment can be valued in many different ways (food production, soil health, public enjoyment) but it 
has been undervalued so far, Mr Clitherow says.
“If the public wants a certain type of environment and they are prepared to pay for it, we should determine what the 
farmer can deliver and what value should be put on this delivery,” he says.
“Supporting farmers to do this by filling the gap where there isn’t a market value seems a legitimate use of public 
money, in my mind.
“Natural capital creates a space where we can put a proper value on environmental assets, rather than income 
foregone.”
See also: Outlook 2019: Farm policy and support payments
Clinton Devon Estates plans to work with its 30 tenant farmers and adjacent landowners to look at how they are 
supporting natural capital, the ways farmers might be rewarded for this, and how they can demonstrate good value 
for money.
“We believe it is possible to be both agriculturally productive and to safeguard nature and the services that come 
from it,” Dr Bridgewater says.
“Financial governmental support for farming in the future is likely to be tied to demonstrating ‘public benefit’ through 
support of environmental services.”
Advice from the experts
Jeremy Clitherow: Seek advice from, for example, Natural England, local farming and wildlife advisory groups, your 
farm adviser, the RSPB and the Wildlife Trust. Challenge your adviser to be aspirational. Be open-minded and have 
a clear aspiration about the natural capital opportunities for your farm business. The current Countryside 
Stewardship scheme is a good place to start and ticks a lot of natural capital boxes.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Dr Sam Bridgewater: First look at the extent and quality of your assets. If the quality is poor, look to improve that. 
Valuing your land and understanding it better will benefit the business in the long run. Don’t fear natural capital – I 
think people will be surprised about what they have got. Go at the speed you can achieve and take it step by step. 
You don’t have to know absolutely everything to do something.
Barney Tremaine: Educate yourself and learn what you have got. For example, ask your local birdwatching team 
what you have in the area. Data gathering is key – you need to have a start point in order to progress.
Future funding
Barney Tremaine, farm manager at Clinton Devon Estates, believes farmers must receive financial support for 
environmental improvements, rather than the burden falling upon individuals.
Without this, some will struggle to make money and those in more productive areas will start farming more 
intensively.
Dr Bridgewater says: “This money could come from the sales price or incentives from government or stewardship 
schemes, or a myriad of things in between, such as reverse auctions [where farmers bid for funding to carry out 
work]. To get that help, farmers have to have the narrative that they’re worth it.”
Defra’s Environmental Land Management scheme (ELMs), proposed to replace the Basic Payment Scheme and 
current agri-environment funding over a transition period after Brexit, will pay farmers based on a natural capital 
valuation approach. Its test and trial period begins this year. 
New markets for natural capital assets should also be explored, Mr Clitherow says. For example, there is an 
increasing market for local provenance hay meadow seeds, because it is important to ensure one particular type is 
not dominant across the country. This gap could be filled by farmers who invest in their species-rich hay meadows.
5-step natural capital plan
Farmers become familiar with the language and the issues, ready to take up any opportunities that arise.
Commission a natural capital plan for the farm, and make sure it is an integrated part of the farm business.
Consider implementing that plan along with neighbours, to ensure connectivity across the landscape.
See this as a business opportunity and create plans for other farms. Better to have farmers talking to farmers, 
rather than parachuting in experts.
Be able to talk about natural capital to various groups as an ambassador, speaking from the farmer’s perspective.

Case study: Tresemple Farm
The Duchy of Cornwall has implemented a natural capital memorandum of understanding (MoU) at the 87ha 
Tresemple Farm, near Truro, alongside a 15-year farm business tenancy agreement. 
Rhys and Lois Morris began their tenancy at Tresemple in September 2018 and have worked with Mr Clitherow to 
identify their assets and where best to site them, as well as applying for a Higher Tier Countryside Stewardship 
scheme.
Previously arable land and permanent pasture, the farm is now home to 125 head of pedigree Aberdeen Angus 
cattle, with pigs enjoying the less suitable land.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Already interested in working in tandem with the environment, the couple saw the tenancy as the perfect 
opportunity to work with a landlord with similar aims.
“The MoU lays out very clearly what the Duchy is looking for in a tenant and nudges them in the direction of what 
would be beneficial for the farm and the environment, and we have built on that,” Mrs Morris explains.
“Getting the balance right to allow natural capital to flourish and be a profitable farm is important.”
See also: Expert tips on how to apply for a farm tenancy
The MoU includes guidelines on restoring natural capital features, such as post-medieval parkland, taking care of 
areas prone to erosion, preventing run-off into water sources, and taking care of and encouraging wildlife.
“Now is the time to make decisions on the environmental aspects while we’re understocked,” Mr Morris says.
“This is a very beneficial position because it means we can fit our farm to what we want to achieve 
environmentally.”
He adds that it was crucial for the MoU to be flexible, because the Duchy didn’t know what tenant or farm system 
would end up on the farm.
“The natural capital part is going to be an ongoing process for the next 15 years,” Mrs Morris says.
“You need several years on a farm to understand it and as the seasons go on we learn even more.
“What’s important is that the Duchy hasn’t asked us to do anything impossible and our job is to make it work within 
our business.”

Planting tree shelterbelts and extending the grazing period for cattle are among the recommendations in a new 
voluntary code of practice to help farmers in Northern Ireland reduce ammonia emissions.
The code has been produced in collaboration with the farming industry and outlines changes farmers can make in 
the way they store and spread manures, and feed and manage their livestock.
 
The aim is to help NI contribute to the UK target of reducing ammonia emission by 8% in 2020 and 16% in 2030.
 
See also: Gove’s new pollution controls: the details and reaction
The agricultural sector contributes 94% of all ammonia emissions in NI.
 
Norman Fulton, head of food and farming at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) 
said widespread adoption of the measures in the document were needed.
 
“Reducing ammonia emissions is one of the key environmental challenges facing agriculture,” he said.
 
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
“Many farmers have already made good progress by using methods that reduce ammonia emissions including how 
they store and spread manures and by changes made to their livestock diets.
 
“But we need to do more and farmers are in a great position to help us protect and enhance our environment, our 
sensitive and protected habitats as well as the air we breathe.”
Covering manure heaps
The code includes recommendations such as covering manure heaps and outside slurry stores, using low-emission 
slurry-spreading techniques and formulating cattle rations that are lower in crude proteins.
 
It is estimated that 60-90% of crude proteins are excreted by animals and so a reduction of 1% CP content in 
ruminant diets can reduce ammonia emission by 5-15%.
 
It is also recommended that farmers consider planting tree shelterbelts around livestock housing or slurry stores to 
help capture and disperse emissions.
 
Scientific modelling estimates indicate that up to 27% of ammonia emissions from livestock houses and up to 19% 
from other sources such as lagoons may be captured by semi-mature plantings of trees.
 
Other recommendations include extended grazing of animals where possible, as grazed animals produce far less 
ammonia than housed animals.
 
This is because urine when excreted by grazing animals does not normally mix with the faeces, so the action of the 
enzyme urease, which is present in faeces and converts the urea in urine to ammonia, is minimised.
 
Read the Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Reduction of Ammonia Emissions on the Daera website.

After two years of Brexit water boarding and the 24-hour drip, drip, drip of politicians squabbling like toddlers in the 
playground, I find myself desensitised to politics. Soundbites from Radio 4’s Today programme wash over me. 
“Equal pay for equal work is hardly a controversial idea,” the politician began. “We will extend the £10/hour living 
wage to under 18s.” My ears pricked towards the radio.

I am not, it appears, desensitised to cheap party promises. Besides, isn’t that what delivered the Brexit mess in the 
first place?
What on earth does Labour’s pledge to increase under-18s wages by more than 75% expect to achieve? Other 
than a bribe for votes from the younger generation, it is divisive and counter-productive.

I struggle with career politicians telling business people how to run their business. Perhaps it is resentment I gained 
from having a French teacher who couldn’t speak French. Do as I say, not as I do.
If you have never had a job in the commercial world or run a business (bar a few weeks running a union or working 
for a friend’s PR agency), how can you make informed promises and grasp the implications for small and micro 
businesses and moreover, in this case, young people.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has failed to understand any of the hurdles young people need to overcome when 
seeking employment.
The biggest is getting the first job – paid or unpaid – then building confidence in yourself and your employer.
Learn to work
I don’t profess to be an expert, but my wife and I have spent the last couple of years running a scheme to give 
young people an opportunity to gain work experience selling sunflowers on our farm. We call it “learn to work”. 
Young people are up against it when it comes to job offers. We are trying to create a platform for them to develop 
simple people skills, independence, time-keeping, working in a team, communicating with peers and with customers 
– thus building confidence, self esteem and their bank balance. Helping young people build a CV that shows their 
skills beyond the narrow alleys of GCSEs or 'A’ levels.
If the minimum wage for 16-year-olds rose from £5.65/hour to £10/hour, how many of the dozen or so we put 
through our scheme last year would we be able to employ at that level? The incentive to give younger people the 
opportunity would, I am sorry to say, evaporate.
Employers want evidence of a young person’s will, desire and application. GCSE and 'A’ levels are a starting place 
for HR departments, but not the panacea to employment.
And what message does it send? Getting paid beyond your worth, without experience, will fester resentment in the 
workplace. It will feed the virus of entitlement that is spreading though society. It needs no propulsion.
Regrettably there aren’t the opportunities available to young people for holiday work that there were 20 years ago. 
Large machinery and small numbers of staff to oversee have made it difficult. But as farmers we have an 
opportunity.
The new qualification 'T’ levels are starting in September 2020.  As an alternative to A’ levels, they will offer 
students a course that combines time in the classroom with time in the workplace.  It will give farming a springboard 
to attract a young audience to agriculture.
Young people need job opportunities far more than they need £10/hour.

Land used for organic farming in the UK has declined for the ninth year in the past 10, as acreage with a low 
production value has ceased to be used for agriculture.
The latest Defra statistics for 2018 show the UK has a total area of 474ha farmed organically, a decrease of 8.4% 
on the previous year.
See also: New, free advice service for farmers considering going organic
Just 2.7% of the total farmed area in the UK is used for organic cultivation, but the amount of land in conversion to 
organic has continued its modest five-year climb.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate

Land in the process of becoming organic hit a six-year high last year, reaching 32,900ha, up 0.9% on 2017 but 
down 72.4% on the highs of a decade ago.

Organic livestock producer and processors numbers in the UK fell by 6% in 2018, but Defra said  this was largely a 
result of a recalibration of how producers were classified and could not be attributed to a genuine drop.
Cattle and poultry livestock numbers increased by 10.3% and 10.5% to 324,100 and 3.38 million respectively, 
whereas numbers of sheep and pigs fell having both increased in 2016/17.

In 2018 there were 826,600 organic sheep in the UK and 37,400 pigs, according to Defra.
All three main crop types: cereals, vegetables including potatoes and other arable crops have continued their 
decline over the past decade, largely emulating the fall in area farmed.

Pig prices continue to rise, pulled up by a falling pound and growing export demand as China draws in more supply 
to make up for its African swine fever (ASF) losses.
In the week ended 18 May, the EU-spec Standard Pigs Price (SPP) rose by 1.51p/kg dw to average 144.45p/kg. 
The All Pigs Price – always a week behind the SPP in reporting – also rose, putting on just over a penny a kilo to 
average 146.64p/kg in the week to 11 May.
Weaner prices also rose again in the week to 18 May, with 7kg stock up just 43p to £35.75 a head. A small sample 
meant there was no price report for 30kg weaners.
Increasing demand in Europe continues to feed through to UK prices, said the AHDB, and prices remain below last 
year’s price level, with the differential narrowing.
Meanwhile, European pigmeat exports to China rose by 39% in January and February.
Early 2019 also saw a rise in fresh and frozen retail pork sales in the UK. The 12 weeks to 21 April saw an extra 
4.7% spent on this sector, according to retail analyst Kantar Worldpanel.

International food consultancy Gira predicts that it will take China until 2023 to recover from ASF, but also that this 
recovery could bring a massive market challenge for pig producers elsewhere, who will have enjoyed the market 
benefit of filling the Chinese supply gap created by ASF.

UK pigmeat production is up 1% in the year to April. Higher carcass weights have driven production levels, despite 
a stable supply of clean pigs and a drop in sow and boar slaughterings, said AHDB Pork.
The Danish pig herd is falling in numbers, down 4.4% in a year to 12.2 million head on 1 April. The herd has 
reduced by a further 3.8% since January.
Cranswick continues expansion investment
Food producer Cranswick achieved a slight rise in profits in the year ended 31 March 2019.
On a like-for-like basis, pre-tax profits rose 2% to £92m for the Yorkshire-based pork, poultry and meat products 
group, which will raise its full-year dividend to 55.9p a share (53.7p on 2018 results).
Turnover at £1.44bn was similar to that of the previous year. Pork accounts for 32% of group revenue; cooked meat 
and continental products 35%; gourmet products (sausage, bacon and pastry) 19%; and poultry 14%.
Export revenue rose slightly and the company invested £11m in its three pork-processing facilities during the year.
It is also building a £75m poultry-processing facility in Suffolk, which it says is the first new primary poultry plant to 
be built in the UK for 30 years. It will be able to handle up to 1.2 million birds a week.

A major trial has been set up to find the most profitable and sustainable way to grow arable crops by comparing 
three different establishment systems over five years.
Establishment systems vary hugely from intensive soil cultivations such as ploughing, through to carrying out no 
cultivations at all with direct drilling.
Each approach has its  pros and cons, making it difficult to assess which is the best system. For example, while 
switching from ploughing to min-till can cut establishment costs, it can also increase the risk of weed problems. 
See also: How Clearfield varieties can tackle erucic acid problems in OSR
So to help farmers identify the best system for the future, the Conservation Agriculture and Sustainable Farming 
Practices project is comparing a plough-based system with min-till and low-till approaches. 
The three systems will be assessed for their riskiness, agronomy, field operations, productivity, complexity, 
profitability and sustainability.
The project
The project is being held at the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust’s farm at Loddington, Leicestershire, in 
partnership with agrochemical company Syngenta and Niab Tag.
It is also being replicated by grower Andy Barr on his Kent farm, and at sites in France and Spain.
At Loddington, the trial is being conducted in five fields over a full five-year rotation consisting of winter wheat, 
barley, oilseed rape, winter wheat and spring beans, with each establishment system carried out over two tramlines.
Head of farming at the Allerton project, Phil Jarvis, says that across all the sites the concept is being replicated, but 
different machinery may be being used at each farm.
At Loddington on heavy clay, a straw disc or a very shallow discing with a Väderstad Carrier down to 2.5cm will be 
used for the low-till establishment, with either a light disc or a Sumo Low Disturbance Subsoiler used before drilling 
for the min-till system.

Three systems at Loddington
No-till: Straw disc or a very shallow discing with a Väderstad Carrier down to 2.5cm 
Min-till: Light disc or a Sumo Low Disturbance Subsoiler used before drilling
Plough: A couple of discings and a pass with a power harrow
For the plough-based regime, a couple of discings and a pass with a power harrow will be used.
The project is now in its second year, with three main findings from the first year of research.
1. Germination
“One of the highlights from year one was the level of underestimation by me as a farmer about how poor 
germination was,” says Mr Jarvis.
As much as 40% of some of the crops did not germinate. With spring beans, there was 100% germination in the 
plough-based system, but because it was so wet, germination dropped to just 50% for min-till and low-till.
However, germination did not translate through to yield, as due to the very wet spring and summer drought last year 
the whole crop yielded poorly.
For winter barley, Mr Jarvis was aiming for 208 plants/sq m, but ended up with an average of 135 plants/sq m.
Similarly, for rapeseed the target was 75 plants/sq m, but only 48 plants/sq m was achieved.
The germination results also highlighted the effect of timing and weather on the effectiveness of establishment 
methods.
For the crop of Leeds winter wheat, ploughing achieved the highest germination, with 404 plants/ sq m, while just 
261 germinated in the light-till regime.
However, for Shabras winter wheat the results were reversed, with light-till achieving 389 plants/sq m in comparison 
to 267 plants/sq m for the plough-based system.
While the crop of Leeds was ploughed early, allowing the seed-bed to become well-weathered, the Shabras was 
ploughed late, leaving a dry, lumpy seed-bed.
“In a dry year it’s probably better to plough early if you use a plough, or it might be better in a dry year not to touch 
any of the soil,” says Mr Jarvis.
2. Weeds
Although ploughing is often seen as a helpful reset for fields which are infested with blackgrass, burying the seed to 
a depth at which it is no longer viable, the trial revealed that this seed bank will persist, waiting for an opportunity to 
be brought back up to a viable depth.
The plough hasn’t been used at Loddington generally since 1997 when the farm first moved towards minimum 
tillage.
Since 2013 Mr Jarvis has direct drilled with a Dale Eco drill.

Despite the length of time the seed bank had gone undisturbed, the weed burden in the ploughed crops shows that 
the seed remained viable.
“We had a huge seed bank. The fields hadn’t been ploughed for a few years and it was just waiting,” says Mr Jarvis.
In the crop of oilseed rape, blackgrass numbers reached 124 plants/sq m in the ploughed areas, in comparison to 
just 20 plants/sq m for the light-till.
In the same field ploughing brought up huge numbers of charlock seed, resulting in 610 plants/sq m, in comparison 
to just 7 plants/sq m for the light till.
This number has greatly reduced now that the field is into its second year of the rotation, dropping to just 123

3. Profitability
Even with reduced machinery costs, the plough-based system was £27/ha more profitable than either the min-
tillage or the low-tillage system in the first year.
“Just because £100 was saved on machinery costs doesn’t necessarily mean greater profitability,” says Mr Jarvis.
While yields will increase in the min-tillage and low-tillage systems and increase the profitability of these 
establishment methods, it will take time, Mr Jarvis predicts, based on 15 years of cultivation trial data carried out at 
Loddington.

“By year four I would expect to start seeing improvements, and by year six I would expect low-tillage to be above 
ploughing in terms of profitability, but you might be out of business by then,” he says.
If growers are to go down the route of low-till then they must clear out their toolbox, he says.
“If we are preparing for the future, then growers must be a bit leaner.

“Selling unused machinery is the equivalent to £30/ha in the light-till system. It’s a quick fix if you can save on 
machinery.”
However, with £450/ha spent on variable costs such as seed and plant protection products, he acknowledges that 
variable costs must also be reduced to increase profitability.
“We chase yield like it’s the holy grail, and we forget about profitability.
“Profitability and gross margins really show up in this trial.”
Regenerative agriculture
Much of the work presently being undertaken at the Allerton Project is looking at a move towards regenerative 
agriculture, for which this conservation agriculture trial could form the basis.
This includes looking at areas such as reducing inputs, the risks of being insecticide free, and getting better at 
maintaining continual soil cover.
“A lot of farmers would say they do a lot of integrated pest management. We could tinker with it, or as the next 
generation are we going to have a regenerative farming system.
“A lot of farmers are on the cusp of doing it,” says Mr Jarvis.
He says that regenerative agriculture is sustainable agriculture plus livestock plus grass, with a system shift 
mindset.
“This is about productivity for business and biodiversity and looking forward in a positive manner,” he says.

Rural crime is an ongoing concern for farmers and landowners, costing the UK economy an estimated £44.5m in 
2017, according to rural insurer NFU Mutual.
However, chronic underreporting of rural crime, mainly due to anger and frustration at the police and government, 
means this figure could be just the tip of the iceberg.
The 2018 National Rural Crime Survey found that more than one in four (27%) victims of crime do not report it to 
the police.
See also: Exclusive survey: What farmers say about rural crime
Many farmers still believe that reporting rural crime is a waste of time as police are under-resourced and too busy to 
take it seriously. Added to this is the concern that doing so could result in a hike in insurance premiums.
But police forces say they desperately need farmers, who are the “eyes and ears” of their communities, to report all 
incidences of crime, as this helps to build an accurate picture of criminality across the regions.
Failure to report local rural crime means it will be perceived as less of a problem and police resources will be 
focused elsewhere.

JOURNAL : Farmers Weekly
The Scotgrass site at Crichton near Dumfries was busy with the sounds of forage harvesters, tractors and loading 
shovels making light work of a healthy grass crop. We've picked out some of the highlights – including new 
mergers, mowers and forage wagons.
Kuhn Merge Maxx 950
Mergers appear to be offering genuine competition to rake in the business of windrowing grass ahead of balers and 
foragers.
Kuhn’s version – the Merge Maxx – uses two adjustable, variable width and bi-directional belts to pick up grass 
across a 9.5m width in one pass.
The belts can be run in either direction, meaning they can be run inwards or outwards to form a single window, or in 
the same direction to create a swath from 18m or forage using two passes. In light crops, such as a multi-cut silage 
system, it can be used to collect 27m of grass into one windrow from three passes.
The upshot of this, says Kuhn, is that pick-up and window width can be adjusted to suit the quantity and type of 
forage material, which may help to reduce the number of passes required.
Rollers at the front and side of the pick-up apparently pass the crop onto the merger belts more smoothly and lump-
free than a rake, which means foragers can potentially run up to 3kph quicker.
To help follow ground contours, the pick-up skids articulate and there are also springs and pivot points to provide 
vertical and angled ground clearance. This should mean less debris contaminating the crop and few damaged 
blades on the forager or baler.
The base price is £68,555.

SIP front-and-rear mergers
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Also offering a merger option was Slovenian firm SIP, which believes it could start replacing rakes, particularly 
among those fastidious about silage quality.
Rather than dragging tines across the ground – which can sweep contaminants such as stones and crusted slurry 
into the swath – the merger uses a baler-style pickup to lift the grass off the ground, leaving the undesirables 
behind.
Once off the ground, the crop is deposited onto a conveyor belt, which gathers it into a row.
The firm introduced its first front-mounted machine last year and has just added a rear, trailed unit to the line-up. 
These can be used as standalone machines, but deliver the best results when teamed together.
In two bouts, the front-and-rear combination will gather in up to 16m of grass into a single row. This is less than a 
typical four-rotor rake, but thanks to forward speeds of up to 20kph, it will apparently outperform one.
The combination pictured, which includes the front-mounted Air300F and rear Air500, comes in at about £60,000.
   
Pottinger Novacat A10 Cross Flow
Scything its way through the lush grass on the Pottinger stand was the firm’s latest set of Novacat A10 mowers, 
which were showcasing the benefits of a new Cross Flow option.
This uses an auger running behind the mowing discs on both wings to ferry all the cut grass into the central run 
behind the tractor – ideal for high-powered foragers capable of gobbling 10m of grass in one pass.
The Cross Flow augers use two curved guards to either leave the grass spread over the full width when open, or to 
bring all material into one row for crops when closed. The latter is good for forage rye, where there is a potentially 
high leaf loss when rowing up.   
Fitting the machine to an Isobus-ready tractor allows operators to make use of its steering sensor for width 
adjustment when cornering, which means overlaps are reduced and near-full widths are taken on bends.
The mechanically driven 10m mowers, along with the smaller 352CF rear-mounted single mower, are the only two 
models available with Cross Flow. The A10 retails for £58,796.
Bergmann Carex 390K
Bergmann forage wagons are a fairly rare sight in the UK, but importer Continental Soil Technology is hoping to 
change that by bringing in the German maker’s latest collection of high-spec machines.
There are two ranges on offer – the Shuttle and the Carex – but the slightly smaller Carex is the machine the firm is 
concentrating on. This comes in several different sizes, ranging from 27 to 52cu m, which puts the 39cu m 390 
pictured roughly in the middle of the range.
This has a 2,050mm-wide pickup, which is hydraulically driven to allow better matching of pick-up and forward 
speed, and it can be reversed to clear blockages. Bergmann has also stuck with a cam-track pickup so that it can 
be run at lower speeds and deliver the grass smoothly into the rotor.
To improve crop flow, the rotor is mounted low in the machine and there’s a sloping floor to help the grass move 
freely into the box. All Carex machines run a set of 41 knives, which delivers a 35mm chop length. There’s also a 
movable headboard to help increase capacity.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Unlike the many manufacturers that build their boxes shorter and add bolt-on extensions, Bergmann builds theirs in 
one piece. The idea is that it makes it stronger, but it does make them more difficult and expensive to ship into the 
country.
As a result, Continental Soil Technology is selling the machines direct to farmers, rather than through a dealer 
network. Prices for the Carex line-up range from £50,000 to £100,000, depending on size and spec.
The larger Shuttle models use the same chassis and box construction as the Carex, but they feature larger bodies 
and have the option of triple axles. They also have a wider a 2,256mm pickup and 54-knives.
 
JOURNAL : Farmers Weekly
The big foragers took to the grass at the triennial Scotgrass event near Dumfries, where punters got the chance to 
see machines from the likes of Fendt, New Holland, Claas, Krone and John Deere in action.
John Deere 9900i
Following its launch last year, John Deere’s V12-powered 9000-series forager is settling into its first season of 
proper work on UK farms.
The 9900i pictured is the flagship of the range and is fitted with a 24.2-litre Liebherr powerplant that delivers an 
impressive 970hp.
Opened right up, this engine is actually capable of more than 1,000hp, but Deere chose to dial that figure down a 
little to give it a flatter torque curve and better driving characteristics.
The result is constant power delivery between 1,400rpm and 1,800rpm, with peak torque coming at just 1,350rpm.
This work has also helped reduce fuel consumption, which Deere says is 10% better than the biggest of the 
previous Cummins-powered 8000-series machines.
Other models using this engine include the 770hp 9700 and the 870hp 9800, but the pup of the range, the 625hp 
9600, is fitted with the firm’s own 13.5-litre PSX unit.
Engine outputs aside, all models in the range feature a fairly similar spec.
This includes a Prodrive hydrostatic transmission with automatic engine speed management and an 850mm-wide 
cutterhead.
To make the most of the extra power, engineers have also strengthened the driveline and hydraulic circuits, which 
has helped increase the speed of crop flow.
Other options include a new heavy-duty kernel processor called the XStream.
This has a 250mm roll diameter and a 50% speed differential for more aggressive smashing of the kernels.
The price of the machine on show was £594,500. 
Fendt Katana 85
Despite having a pretty new range of grass kit on show, it was the thrum of the Katana forager’s MTU engine that 
got the punters on the Fendt stand drooling.
The firm gave a run out to the bigger of its two-model range, which serves up a healthy 850hp from a 21-litre V12 
block.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Coupled to that, the Katana 85 carries a two-range hydostatic transmission, and Fendt says the combination 
delivers some very competitive fuel consumption figures that can be improved by running in eco mode, where 
lighter crops allow.
Four-wheel drive is standard, too, which may well be an attraction for anyone harvesting in less-than-ideal, late-
season conditions.
The business end starts with three pairs of oil-powered feed rollers, which pull the crop through to an 800mm-wide 
drum.
A 28-knife setup is standard – offering between 3.7mm and 20.7mm chop lengths – but buyers can also switch to 
20 or 40 blade arrangements that extend forage sizes to 29mm.
List price of the Katana, including a grass header, is £479,600.

New Holland FR 650
Those hoping to catch a glimpse of New Holland’s new flagship forager – the 911hp, V20-powered FR920 – may 
have been disappointed, but there were still two faces from the firm’s Forage Cruiser stable doing the business in 
Dumfries.
Joining the Belgian-made FR550 (544hp) was the slightly bigger FR650 (653hp), which made light work of the site’s 
grass crop.
The latter runs a 15.9-litre, in-line six cylinder from sister firm FPT, and the power package has delivered some solid 
performance stats in trials completed by the DLG German testing house.
It recorded fuel use at a rate of 0.5 litres/t of maize harvested (when chopped at 8mm), which equated to a 21% 
improvement over the FR700 it replaced.
This is dependent on the driving mode selected – power cruise adapts engine and ground speed in relation to the 
load, which saves fuel where possible.
The eco setting has two ranges; one for grass, where the engine runs at 1,950-2,100rpm, and a second for maize 
that sits in a calmer 1,700-1,850rpm range.
The driveline includes a four-speed hydrostatic transmission, and New Holland has it kitted out with four-wheel drive 
and its Terralock traction management system.
Up front, four feed rollers push the crop through an 860mm opening to the 884mm cylinder.
Chop lengths range from 2-33mm depending on the blade configuration – the firm offers eight, 10, 12, 16 and 20-
knife arrangements.
Claas 850 forager
This year, Claas is celebrating the fact that it has produced more than 40,000 self-propelled forage harvesters since 
its original SF60 rolled off the production line in 1973.
As a result, the Jaguar forager pictured is sporting the firm’s 40,000 livery, which neatly masks the fact it’s an 850 
model.
With 462hp on offer from its six-cylinder Mercedes engine, the 850 sits at the lower end of the 800-series range, 
just above the entry-level 840 that develops 408hp.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
The current top dog in the four-model series is the 585hp 870, but this is soon to be trumped by the 880, which 
Claas announced last summer.
Its 15.6-litre Mercedes engine delivers 626hp, which is enough to match the smallest of the 900-range – the 960.
However, its more compact design and cheaper price tag should suit those that don’t need all the bells and whistles 
of the 900-series.
It’s predominately aimed at grassland operators and features the firm’s 20-blade cylinder.
This gives it a range of chop lengths of 5-21mm, or 10-42mm when running half the knives.
Krone BigX 680
Krone stole the headlines last year with the launch of its biggest ever forager – the 1,156hp BigX 1180 – but it was 
the smallest of its four-unit, wide-body forager family that took to the grass at the Crichton site.
As with all the firm’s high-horsepower choppers, Liebherr provides the power unit – in the case of the 680, 780 and 
880, it’s a 16.16-litre V8 tuned to deliver 687hp. By comparison, the biggest model carries a 24-litre V12.
A two-range hydrostatic drive offers speeds up to 40kph and buyers have the option of speccing a four-wheel drive 
kit where maize harvesting is likely to turn boggy.
Six pre-compression intake rollers encourage a smooth crop intake, says Krone, and an 820mm gap between the 
lead roller/metal detector and the counterblade provides pretty reliable protection against foreign objects, even at 
high speeds.
This is considerably more than the likes of the Fendt Katana, which has a 620mm distance from the metal detector 
to the cutting head.
Chopping is done by an 800mm-wide drum with a chevron-style knife layout and Krone offers the choice of 20-, 28- 
or 36-blade setups for most customers, though 40- and 48-blade kits can be sorted to deliver the ultra-short chop 
demanded by biogas plants.
An Optimaize kit allows operators to quickly adjust the chop length by up to 10mm from the cab, without having to 
swap or refit the chopping drum.
It uses a mechanical gearbox on the drum belt drive to reduce the drum speed to reduce cutting frequency.
For those with maize in mind, there are also various corn conditioner options, with most carrying a saw-tooth profile.

More than 100 officers and volunteers from seven police forces across the north of England worked together 
overnight in a bid to tackle rural crime.
The multi-force Operation Checkpoint ran from the afternoon of Thursday 16 May until the early hours of Friday 17 
May. It was the 22nd time the cross-border operation had been held and one of the biggest yet.
It involved officers, staff and volunteers from North Yorkshire Police, alongside Cleveland, Cumbria, Durham, 
Humberside, Lancashire and Northumbria – all providing reassurance to those in rural communities by combating 
criminals who operate across force boundaries.

Tactics included high visibility, intelligence gathering, the use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) 
technology to locate vehicles suspected of being connected to crime, as well as targeting suspicious activity.
In North Yorkshire, more than 30 officers from neighbourhood policing teams, the rural taskforce and proactive 
policing units worked in the border areas in the north and west of the county, specifically targeting cross-border 
offenders. They were boosted by the support of volunteers from six mobile rural watch schemes.
https://twitter.com/NPRuralNmbland/status/1129447619791601664
In total, 40 vehicles were stopped and checked, and a number of traffic offence reports and court summons were 
issued. In addition, two men from outside North Yorkshire were arrested in the Craven area on suspicion of 
possession with intent to supply drugs.
High-visibility patrols
Inspector Jon Grainge, from North Yorkshire Police’s Rural Taskforce, said police are working closely with other 
forces to keep rural communities safe.
He said: “As well as our high-visibility patrols, we took the opportunity to speak to people about the importance of 
crime prevention measures, which are so important in the fight against rural crime.
“Operations like this are really important in bringing communities together and keeping them safe. By working 
closely in, and with, our rural communities, we can prevent crime before it happens, and bring criminals to justice.”
Cleveland Police’s rural crime prevention officer, Paul Payne, added: “We were out in force using the resources we 
have to tackle these persons who continue to blight those living in, working in and visiting our beautiful rural 
settings.”
In Northumbria, 90 vehicles were stopped, resulting in five being seized and two men reported for road traffic 
offences.
Meanwhile, Surrey Police carried out their own rural crime day of action on Monday (20 May) called #OutInForce, 
specifically targeting fly-tippers and poachers.

Generally, night-time temperatures have been warmer on the western side of the country and, as a result, crop 
development has been much faster. Fleece has been removed and harvesters have moved in with token lifts for 
local markets and door trade. So far, quality looks good.
Attention will soon shift to blight spraying and, as seed crops emerge, the control of aphids.
Early pre-emergence yellow water trap results are showing potato and peach potato aphids already, so we will need 
to be on the ball as crops start to emerge.
The AHDB Fight Against Blight (FAB) campaign continues, although there is a different sampling protocol using 
FTA cards (which farmers press against the diseased leaf to get a DNA sample). This allows for more rapid in-
season feedback on blight genotypes, rather than waiting to the end of the season.
I find this vital so I can make informed decisions about the products I intend to use, with resistance management in 
mind.
If you are not already registered as a blight scout, please do so on the dedicated website. The more information we 
get, the more we will be able to understand the changing genotypes and plan control strategies accordingly.

The arable farming sector will need to change and consolidate if it is to remain profitable, the head of Frontier 
Agriculture has said.
Farmers are going to have to get used to doing things differently if they are to survive in a world without subsidy 
payments to fall back on, said managing director Mark Aitchison.
This is likely to mean a significant increase in the amount of collaboration in the industry, with fewer decision-
makers on farms in the future, he said.
See also: Plough, min-till and no-till compared: year one
Strong relationships with fellow farmers to cut costs, and collaboration with the rest of the supply chain will give 
them the power to deal with food companies that are looking to drive tough bargains.
“Successful businesses in the future, farmers or otherwise, will be those that remain open-minded, are prepared to 
change and improve and adapt quickly,” he said.
“One of the things that holds the industry back is that farmers are individuals, and they tend to be distrusting of 
other people in the supply sector when they don’t need to be – we’re all in it together really,” he said.
Mr Aitchison was speaking to Farmers Weekly following a presentation at Camgrain’s first open day for non-
members, where it was announced Frontier had signed a five-year extension to its agreement to market grain for 
the farmer-owned storage co-operative.
Frontier is also in the process of taking over the grain marketing for Fengrain, another farmer-owned grain group, 
after the co-op made a decision in January to end in-house trading, deeming it too risky.
Mr Aitchison, who described himself as “keen on acquisition” said there are likely to be other companies in the grain 
trading sector that are struggling after heavy losses in recent years.
Market share
Frontier buys 5.5m tonnes of crops produced in the UK annually, a market share of around 22%, and has one 
million tonnes of grain stock available at any time.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate

However, Mr Aitchison rebuffed suggestions that it was becoming too big, saying that the scale at which it operated 
gave it negotiating firepower with global food companies, allowing farmers to get properly paid for the value they are 
creating.
The 59-year-old Liverpudlian, who started his professional life as an agronomist, said that Frontier was committed 
to continuing to spending big to help the agriculture sector, with £25m invested annually in the industry each year 
for the past five years.
Future spending has been earmarked for new precision-farming software, grain stores, staff training in new 
agronomy techniques and improved distribution of crop-protection products.
What is Frontier Agriculture?
Formed from the merger of Banks Cargill and Allied Grains in 2005, Frontier has since doubled in size and now 
buys more than one in five tonnes of all crops grown in the UK.
It sells 25% of crop seeds, 21% of fertiliser and 21% of crop-protection products to farmers and buys 22% of all 
crops back from them.
The company has an annual revenue of £1.5bn, and in its most recent set of accounts (to the year ending 30 June 
2018) made a pre-tax profit of £28.4m, a fall of 18% on the previous year.
The company has a strategic advantage in being able to funnel products into other companies owned by either 
Cargill or ABF, which includes large-scale livestock feed production, rapeseed processing and flour milling 
operations.
Other significant buyers include Nestlé, the world’s largest food company, and drinks manufacturers Molson Coors 
and Diageo.
Managing director Mark Aitchison, who has been in charge since its formation, was previously head of Banks 
Cargill following a rapid six-year rise through the ranks after starting out as a farm trader manager.

A niche group of medics suggesting hospitals should stop serving sausages and bacon have misunderstood the 
report they are relying on to support their claim, according to the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board 
(AHDB).
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
The Plant Based Health Professionals group quoted a 2015 International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) 
report, suggesting it showed a person has as much chance of developing cancer if they eat processed meat as they 
would if they smoked or handled asbestos.
Therefore, patients, staff and visitors should not be served these products, the group insisted.
See also: Meat eaters of vegetarians – who has the better arguments?
But Maureen Strong, nutrition manager for AHDB, which represents 72% of agricultural output in Great Britain, said 
the IARC report looks at hazards only and to suggest otherwise is misleading.
“It is a worrying that this small group of medical professionals, who people may look to for advice, are suggesting 
something that it is completely not true,” she said.
“At best, they have misunderstood the report. At worst, it seems that they are pushing a lifestyle change that could 
have a negative effect on the health of some people.”
‘Follow the science’
People should expect our hospitals to respect the importance of scientific evidence to inform policy decisions, said 
Ms Strong.
“To suggest that the IARC report on processed meat implies that it causes cancer is wrong. IARC merely performed 
a hazard analysis, which in no way proves cause and effect,” she added.
“A banana skin on the ground is a hazard, but it does not mean that all banana skins can cause accidents and are, 
therefore, potentially harmful to health. While the IARC has placed processed meat in the same hazard analysis 
category as tobacco smoking and asbestos, the World Health Organization does point out that this does not mean 
they are all equally dangerous.”
Ms Strong said it was worth noting that processed meat is in the same hazard analysis category as hormone 
replacement therapy (HRT) and contraception pills, both of which are prescribed by doctors and for which there is

It’s a simple but effective crime prevention measure that doesn’t cost farmers the earth.
For centuries, earth bunds were used to protect areas and keep unwanted visitors off land near forts, castles and 
human settlements.
Now, in a modern twist, bunds and embankments are helping to deter poachers, hare coursers and joyriders from 
entering farmland in Gloucestershire.
See also: Exclusive survey - what farmers say about rural crime
The Cotswolds is now predominantly an arable area, but many of the walls and fences surrounding farmland have 
not been maintained over the years because of the costs.
Earth bunds offer a cheaper way of building a barrier between roads or lanes and fields to prevent rural criminals 
from entering with 4x4 vehicles and damaging crops or killing livestock and wildlife.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
The initiative is part of Operation Firefly, Gloucestershire Constabulary’s operational response to rural and wildlife 
crime within the county, which forms part of the force's neighbourhood policing operation.
The partnership – between police, plant hire company Smiths of Gloucester, farmers and landowners – started two 
and a half years ago.
Since then, four landowners have signed up and up to 10km of farmland boundaries have been protected – with 
many more kilometres planned.
How the scheme works
Dave Peters, tips and bund manager at Smiths of Gloucester, says police contacted the company last summer to 
enquire about the possibility of creating bunds to secure vulnerable farmland.
Before Smiths’ involvement, ditches and trenches were being dug around fields by another plant hire company to 
keep out criminals. But officers realised these could be hazardous to wildlife and the public, and landowners could 
also find themselves in breach of Defra stewardship and basic payment rules.
“I explained that we could create a solid earth bund, so we started doing it that way instead,” Mr Peters says.
Earth to build the bunds comes from new housing development sites around the county, where Smiths removes 
top- and subsoil to leave a clean, flat bed for houses to be built. The soil is sourced as near to the farm as possible, 
to limit transport costs and any damage to the environment.
Before use all soils are screened for contaminants and certified safe by an independent soils analyst. A U1 
exemption (use of waste in construction) must be obtained from the government to allow up to 1,000t of topsoil to 
be spread on farms without full planning consent being needed.
Before work begins, the team liaises with the Environment Agency and utility companies to make sure none of the 
work will disturb any underground infrastructure.
The team must also check with relevant authorities that the work will not disturb any Sites of Special Scientific 
Interest (SSSI), healthy habitats in general or historically important sites.
No cost to farmers
Smiths does not charge either the police, the taxpayer or the landowner for any construction of the bunds, and the 
company does not receive payments for the materials supplied.
By creating the bunds, it stops suitable, uncontaminated materials being dumped at landfill sites.
“We incur all the machinery, labour and diesel costs. To cause minimum disruption we try and do the work after 
harvest when there is stubble or when the land is set aside,” Mr Peters says.
““If the soil is ‘clean’, there is no reason why that would need to go to landfill,” Mr Peters says.
“Therefore, we are utilising the materials to good effect, saving them from going in a hole in the ground. It’s more 
sustainable and environmentally friendly.”
Typically, a couple of metres of headland is needed to build the bunds, on land which is least productive.
The soils can be tipped and pulled in from the road – as long as space allows – and then a digger bucket is used to 
shape the bund and make it solid and evenly balanced.
A couple of days later, a construction worker from Smiths returns to the farm to check the bund, “trim down” any 
loose areas and “cap” it with topsoil, while ensuring that the insides of the embankment are angled correctly.

his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Some farmers have planted hedgerows around their bunds to add natural shelter, habitat and a source of food for 
wildlife.
Police and landowners are also working with the Cotswolds’ Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) grassland 
project team to sow grass or wildflowers on the bunds from this summer to encourage wildlife and make them look 
more aesthetically pleasing.
Case study: Roger Preece, farm manager, arable farm, near Cirencester
Hare coursers, joyriders and deer poachers have caused difficulties for years at farms in the Cirencester area, 
according to farm manager Roger Preece.
But the situation has improved markedly since bunds were created around problem fields.
“We are still getting some unwanted visitors in our fields, but nowhere near as many as before because we have 
strengthened the boundaries and blocked off the main entrances,” he says.
“It used to be very upsetting to spend time cultivating the land, trying to grow your crops to then have someone 
come and drive all over and destroy it.”
Mr Preece says building the bunds has been one of the best rural crime prevention measures taken at his 405ha 
arable farm.
“The beauty is, it hasn’t cost us a penny. I’d encourage any farmer to talk to their rural crime officer about any rural 
crime issues they have, to see if their boundaries are suitable for bunds.”
‘100% success rate’
PC Ashley Weller, Gloucestershire Constabulary’s rural crime officer for the Cotswolds, says the bunds are helping 
to keep rural criminals at bay.
“Previously, multiple times a week the joyriders were driving into fields, doing donuts, damaging the crops, running 
down deer or using that farmland to access other bits of farmland where they knew there was machinery,” says PC 
Weller.
“Every farmer who has had this [bunds] done has had 100% success – not a single infiltration so far. I’m very 
confident that that success will carry on.
“With the bunds, there is no way for the joyriders to get off the land [to escape] any more – and they know that.”
PC Weller says some farmers who have had bunds built no longer use logs or other barriers to prevent access by 
unwanted visitors.
“They haven’t even fitted gates to the opening points of these fields where the bunds are,” he explains.
“The poachers are too scared to enter as they know they can get blocked in. It’s that fear of one way in, one way 
out. They look at it and realise: ‘This is a trap.’”
Zero-tolerance approach
Last year, Operation Firefly helped to reduce the number of hare coursing incidents in Gloucestershire by 30%.
PC Weller says there is no doubt that the bunds around fields are a major deterrent for coursers, poachers and 
joyriders.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
“We take a zero-tolerance approach now to hare coursing. The days have gone where they can spin us a lie and 
tell us they’ve driven 90 miles to walk their dogs in this field at 3am.
“Previously, we would have to rely on having hard evidence before we started seizing vehicles.
“Now, if we have suspicions, we will seize vehicles, mobile phones and their dogs.”
PC Weller describes the partnership as a “win-win” for police, the farmers, Smiths and the countryside.
“We win, because it reduces crime in our local areas. Smiths avoid landfill costs, which is bad for the environment, 
and the landowner wins because crops are not being damaged or livestock being killed.
“Nature is not getting terrorised and targeted the way it was. The only losers are the criminals.”
WhatsApp group helps farmers share information to catch rural crooks
Farmers are the “eyes and ears” of the countryside and their posts to a WhatsApp group are helping to catch rural 
criminals, police say.
Gloucestershire Police, farmers and landowners in the Cotswolds are all connected with a rural crime WhatsApp 
group, which started in early 2018.
Group members are urged to report any suspicious sightings or criminal activity to alert others.
Information received directly from the WhatsApp forum has enabled police to make four arrests of high-profile 
organised criminal gang members and seize seven vehicles.
“We have 290 members on the Cotswold group alone. It’s been so successful we have adopted it across the whole 
of the police force now,” says PC Weller.
Police have given farmer group members detailed maps of their area, based on military spot maps, with grid 
references to enable police to pinpoint locations during reports of criminal activity.
Gloucestershire Constabulary says it’s essential that all farmers continue to report all incidents of rural crime on 999 
in an emergency; or 101 in a non-emergency.

An investigation has been launched after a fight broke out at the Balmoral Show in Northern Ireland – with footage 
of the brawl posted on social media.
The incident – which involved a number of people – happened in a bar area at the agricultural show on Friday 
evening (17 May).

People can be seen hitting each other, with a number of those involved ending up on the floor.
The fight was broken up by security staff. Click below to watch a video of the brawl.
Nobody is believed to have been seriously injured and it is understood that the ambulance service was not called to 
the incident.
Footage of the brawl later circulated on Facebook and Twitter – attracting the attention of the mainstream media.
The Daily Mail described the fight as the “Quarrel at Balmoral” saying punches were thrown with revellers thrown to 
the floor.

But dairy farmer William Maxwell, from Augher, said on Twitter it was more a case of “handbags at dawn” than a 
mass brawl.
The Royal Ulster Agricultural Society issued a statement saying it would investigate the incident and take the 
“appropriate action”.
It said: “There was an altercation at the bar area, which was quickly brought under control by the event security 
personnel and we believe no one was seriously injured.
“It is sad that a few people resorted to this behaviour when tens of thousands of people enjoyed a fun family day 
out.
"The society will be fully investigating this matter and appropriate action will be taken."
Held at Balmoral Park, County Antrim, the show attracts more than 100,000 visitors, making it one of Northern 
Ireland's biggest annual events.

Natural England has defended its decision to revoke general licences for controlling certain pest bird species on 25 
April, but insists it is now “business as usual” in terms of shooting pigeons and crows.
Giving evidence to the cross-party Environmental, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) committee in London on Tuesday 
(21 May), Natural England deputy chairman Lord Blencathra admitted that “no one saw it coming” when the 
licencing system was challenged.
See also: Licence for shooting pest bird species – where do farmers stand?
Natural England had taken Queen’s Counsel twice, and consulted with Defra lawyers, since campaign group Wild 
Justice had first given notice of its intention to mount a legal challenge of general licences in mid-February.
“We had to act quickly because the legal advice was so assertive,” said Lord Blencathra.
“Although Wild Justice had said ‘we only want to stop the licences from January next year’, we couldn’t continue for 
the next eight months with a system which we were advised was unlawful.”
Lethal control
Interim chief executive Marian Spain explained that, to stay within the law, Natural England had to satisfy itself that 
lethal control was necessary (because the pest bird species had caused damage and that alternative means of 
control had failed), rather than delegating that judgement to the licence user.
She insisted that Natural England had acted quickly to ensure that new individual licences were available on the 
same day the old general licences went down, and that a new general licence for carrion crows was available just 
24 hours later.
New general licences for controlling woodpigeons and Canada geese came through a week later, she added, 
though since then, Defra had taken responsibility and control arrangements for other pest species are still pending.
E Ryanair ready to place more 737 Max orders: O’Leary Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is eager to demonstrate 
his confidence in Boeing and the under-fire 737 Max ....
Ms Spain agreed that the new general licences looked more burdensome than the old one, but that was only 
because they had more detail, spelling out the circumstances in which lethal control would be appropriate.
“We say to the user that, if these are your circumstances, then you are good to go.”
Lord Blencathra added that it was not the case that the farmer had to get his bird scarer out before he could shoot 
pigeons eating his crops.
“If his experience is that these things have been tried in the past and haven’t worked, then he can go straight to 
shooting immediately.”

Paper and packaging makers were in demand after Mondi said it had lifted containerboard prices for the first time in 
more than a year, which sparked hopes that a supply glut had been worked through faster than expected. Smurfit 
Kappa rose after sector peer Mondi told customers it would be raising prices by 10 per cent.
Domestically dependent stocks followed the pound sharply lower as pressure grew on Prime Minister Theresa May 
to resign. Among those stuck in thickening fug surrounding Brexit were easyJet, housebuilder Persimmon and 
retailers including Kingfisher.
Ryanair slipped after HSBC advised selling. Unsuitable fuel hedging for the year ahead, rising non-fuel costs, 
volatile industrial relations and the complication of delays to Boeing jet deliveries made for an obvious bear case, it 
said.
Hargreaves Lansdown faded after Stephen Lansdown, who co-founded the fund management business with 
prominent Leave campaign backer Peter Hargreaves, sold a 1.5 per cent stake.
Marks and Spencer's launch of a deeply discounted £600m rights issue to help fund its Ocado joint venture 
eclipsed in-line results, pushing the retailer below its theoretical ex-rights price. Bryce Elder

SpiceJet vote of confidence in Boeing 737 Max Airlines

SpiceJet, one of India's largest private airlines, said it expected its Boeing 737 Max 8 jets to be back in the air by 
July, in a vote of confidence for the plane that has crashed twice in the past six months.
SpiceJet is one of Boeing's biggest customers for the Max planes, with 13 Max 8s in its fleet and an order for 192 
more Max aircraft by 2025 as it plans to expand its capacity in the fastest growing domestic aviation market. "We 
expect that they will fly in July," SpiceJet chairman and managing director Ajay Singh told the FT in an interview at 
his office on New Delhi's outskirts.
"We are confident that it's a great plane. It's a completely safe aircraft, so we are waiting for the regulators to take 
that view."
Global regulators are meeting today and tomorrow to consider when the Boeing 737 Max can return to the skies 
following two deadly crashes that have undermined the reputation of the world's largest commercial aircraft maker.
The US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, is in discussions to give the plane full certification by the end 
of June after software fixes, paving the way for regulators around the world to clear the best-selling jet to fly.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said on Monday he expected the Max to be flying in North America by the 
end of June. He added that Europe's aviation safety agency, EASA, "will take another month".
SpiceJet vote of confidence in Boeing 737 Max Airlines
Some countries, including Indonesia, where the Lion Air 737 Max crashed in October 2018, have indicated they 
may take more time to review the plane and train pilots.
But Mr Singh said he did not anticipate regulatory delays in India.
India's aviation sector has gone through a tumultuous few months with skyrocketing airfares and a severe shortage 
of seats following the April collapse of Jet Airways, India's oldest private carrier.
Despite the difficulties, Mr Singh, who controls 51 per cent of SpiceJet after it nearly collapsed in 2014, expressed 
optimism about the future of the aviation industry in India.
A key architect of Narendra Modi's winning election campaign in 2014, Mr Singh said he was confident that if Mr 
Modi secures a second term the government would overhaul the sector and "remove bottlenecks", starting with 
reducing punitive taxes on jet fuel.
"We are close to making that a reality," said Mr Singh. "We've discussed this with the central government as well as 
with state governments and there seems to be consensus that this needs to happen and we hope that with the new 
government coming in this can happen quickly."
India's carriers are vulnerable to spikes in the oil price and a weakening rupee. Fuel makes up 34 per cent of 
operating costs for the country's airlines, far above the global average of 24 per cent, according to the International 
Air Transport Association.
A surge in oil prices precipitated Jet's collapse and contributed to the demise of Kingfisher Airlines, which crumbled 
under a mountain of debt in 2012.
"It made me feel sad that an airline of Jet's size and a brand as iconic as Jet should go down," said Mr Singh, who 
has been dubbed the "turnround man" after rescuing SpiceJet in 2014.
Mr Singh founded SpiceJet in 2005 after serving as a Bharatiya Janata Party appointee on the board of the Delhi 
Transport Corporation, a state-run bus service, and national broadcast network Doordarshan.
He exited the airline five years later before coming back as a white knight, injecting $100m to keep the carrier alive - 
and sparing Mr Modi's administration the headache of a collapsed carrier months after coming into power.

Despite the difficulties, Mr Singh, who controls 51 per cent of SpiceJet after it nearly collapsed in 2014, expressed 
optimism about the future of the aviation industry in India.
A key architect of Narendra Modi's winning election campaign in 2014, Mr Singh said he was confident that if Mr 
Modi secures a second term the government would overhaul the sector and "remove bottlenecks", starting with 
reducing punitive taxes on jet fuel.
"We are close to making that a reality," said Mr Singh. "We've discussed this with the central government as well as 
with state governments and there seems to be consensus that this needs to happen and we hope that with the new 
government coming in this can happen quickly."
India's carriers are vulnerable to spikes in the oil price and a weakening rupee. Fuel makes up 34 per cent of 
operating costs for the country's airlines, far above the global average of 24 per cent, according to the International 
Air Transport Association.
A surge in oil prices precipitated Jet's collapse and contributed to the demise of Kingfisher Airlines, which crumbled 
under a mountain of debt in 2012.
"It made me feel sad that an airline of Jet's size and a brand as iconic as Jet should go down," said Mr Singh, who 
has been dubbed the "turnround man" after rescuing SpiceJet in 2014.
Mr Singh founded SpiceJet in 2005 after serving as a Bharatiya Janata Party appointee on the board of the Delhi 
Transport Corporation, a state-run bus service, and national broadcast network Doordarshan.
He exited the airline five years later before coming back as a white knight, injecting $100m to keep the carrier alive - 
and sparing Mr Modi's administration the headache of a collapsed carrier months after coming into power.

British union to ballot Ryanair pilots over possible strike action

The union representing Ryanair's British pilots will hold an indicative ballot to see if there is support for industrial 
action over a pay dispute, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Ryanair suffered a series of damaging strikes last year after the carrier bowed to pressure in late 2017 to recognise 
unions for the first time. That contributed to the weakest annual profit in four years, the airline reported on Monday.
Europe's largest budget airline has managed to quell the disputes by reaching agreements with many unions in 
Europe on pay and allowances, but has yet to move beyond the recognition agreement it struck with Britain's 
BALPA union almost 18 months ago.
In a newsletter to members sent on Monday, the union said Ryanair had "failed to even table a counter offer" to the 
pay claim it submitted as part of the talks on a wider agreement and accused the airline of "stalling tactics".
"The stance adopted by the company does not allow us, as Ryanair pilots, to share meaningfully in the success of 
the company - a success that we have all been instrumental in achieving," BALPA's Ryanair Company Council said 
in the letter.
BALPA said that the indicative ballot would be followed by an official ballot if it opted for industrial action but that it 
intended to reach a negotiated settlement without the need for escalation, "if at all possible".
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said earlier on Monday that he did not expect disruption this summer due 
to labour issues, but that he can never completely rule out renewed disruption. (Reuters)

Austria's political leaders and sports figures mourned Niki Lauda as a national icon and commemorated his strong 
personality after the three-time Formula One world champion died on Monday, aged 70.
"One of the greatest and colourful characters has left us - an idol and ambitious fighter who never gave up," 
Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen said in a statement.
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz also remembered Lauda as an airline entrepreneur.
"The race tracks were his home and aviation was his love," Kurz said, stating that "the entire country and the world 
of motorsports mourn one of the greatest Austrians."
"He is an example of courage, discipline and straightforwardness," the chancellor said of the Formula One legend 
who had achieved sports and business comebacks from an almost lethal racing accident and from the crash of a 
large passenger aircraft.
"Niki Lauda was an inspiration and visionary for the entire airline industry," Laudamotion airline said in a tribute.
Lauda, who was known as a tough businessman, originally founded the airline, sold it, bought it back, and sold it 
again to Irish budget carrier Ryanair last year.
"He was incredibly egoistic," said Helmut Marko, the Austrian advisor of the Red Bull Formula One team.
However, Lauda's personality had softened after he met his second wife Birgit, and after she gave birth to his two 
youngest children, Marko told broadcaster Oe24.
"He became more considerate, which had not been his strength," Marko said about his friend Lauda, who served as 
non-executive chairman of the Mercedes Formula One team.
Austria commemorates national sport and business icon Lauda
Lauda was friends with various Austrian top athletes, including Annemarie Moser-Proell, who ranks among the most 
successful athletes in Alpine skiing history.
"His fighting spirit after his accident, and the way he fought back - what he achieved is incredible," she said.
The former racer also fondly remembered how Lauda had picked her up with his private jet after one of her overall 
World Cup victories.
Retired Austrian tennis great Thomas Muster said he liked Lauda's "direct manner, and his way of tackling issues 
head-on."
"That's what made him special," Muster said.

Austrian Formula One legend Niki Lauda has died at age 70, his doctor Walter Klepetko told dpa early Tuesday.
Lauda died peacefully in his sleep on Monday surrounded by family, a family spokeswoman said in a statement.
"His unique achievements as an athlete and entrepreneur are and will remain unforgettable," the statement added.
The three-time world champion received a lung transplant last year, and was hospitalized with the flu in January. He 
had in previous years received two kidney transplants.
Lauda's head was badly burned in a fiery crash at the German Grand Prix in 1976 and his lungs were damaged by 
toxic smoke.
Following his first Formula One world title in 1975, Lauda won two more times in 1977 and 1984.
By the end of his racing career in 1985, he had competed in 171 Formula One races, won 25 of them and stood on 
the podium 54 times.
Before retiring, the racer launched Lauda Air in 1979 which he sold in the 1990s.
In 2003, he founded another airline, Niki, which he sold to Air Berlin in 2011. He bought it back in January 2018 to 
run it under the Laudamotion brand, only to sell it quickly to Irish budget carrier Ryanair.
In later years, Lauda became an adviser for the Ferrari race team, before becoming non-executive chairman of the 
Mercedes F1 team in 2012.

The Austrian world champion was known for his red cap, shrewd business sense and will to survive.
Formula One legend Niki Lauda was not a quitter.
After a horrific car crash that disfigured him for life he went on to win races, and he weathered the crash of a 
passenger jet during his time as an airline entrepreneur.
On Monday, the Austrian triple world champion died at the age of 70 less than a year after receiving an emergency 
lung transplant.
The surgery was performed almost exactly 42 years after Lauda crashed into a fence at the German Nuerburgring 
track at a speed of 200 kilometres an hour during a race.
"The impact was so hard that the helmet was ripped off my head," he said of the crash.
His Ferrari went up in flames, and it took 55 seconds to pull him out of the car.
At the hospital, a priest gave him the last rites, in light of his serious burns and damaged lung.
"But I did not want to die. I wanted to go on living," Lauda said four decades after the crash.
Lauda did not only go on living, he went on fighting.
Just 42 days after the crash, Lauda was again behind the wheel and took fourth place in the Italian Grand Prix in 
Monza, ending the championship season as runner-up to British rival James Hunt.
Niki Lauda, legendary Formula One survivor, dies at 70
"Coming back quickly was part of my strategy of not sitting at home and thinking about why this had happened to 
me," he said.
Apart from lingering health problems, the crash also left Lauda with his signature red sports cap.
His physiotherapist initially gave it to him to keep his head bandages in place, but he kept wearing it so that people 
would look him in the eye rather than at his scarred scalp.
Following his first Formula One world title in 1975, Lauda won two more times in 1977 and 1984.
By the time the Austrian ended his racing career in 1985, he had competed in 171 Formula One races, winning 25 
of them and standing on the podium 54 times.
Before retiring from the track, the racer launched Lauda Air in 1979.
In May 1991, one of his aircraft crashed after takeoff from Bangkok. All 223 passengers and crew members died.
"I was deeply shocked," Lauda said of the accident, admitting that he felt guilty until an investigation showed a 
technical problem caused the tragedy.
Lauda, known as a tough businessman, sold the airline in the 1990s.
In 2003, he founded another airline, Niki, which he sold to Air Berlin in 2011. He bought it back in January 2018 to 
run it under the Laudamotion brand, only to sell it quickly to Irish budget carrier Ryanair.
The son of an industrialist family proved his shrewdness when he started his racing career.
He lied to his grandmother to get money for his first racing car, saying he needed it to buy real estate, according to 
a book he co-authored on his business outlook.
He also faked his high school diploma in order to get parental approval to begin car racing.
In later years, Lauda became an adviser for the Ferrari race team, before becoming non-executive chairman of the 
Mercedes F1 team in 2012.
Since then, Mercedes have dominated the hybrid era with three drivers' world titles with Lewis Hamilton and one 
from the now retired Nico Rosberg alongside four constructors' championships.
Lauda was also known to motorsport fans as a television commentator over 20 years.
"Red cap, clear and direct words," Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff said in summarizing the man.

THE MAIN share index slipped again yesterday as worries over international trade increased on the back of US 
curbs on China's Huawei, while weak results from Ryanair triggered a sell-off in airlines across the board.
The FTSE 100 gave up 0.5 per cent and the mid-cap index was 0.8 per cent lower.
The indexes, however, fared better than their European peers whose chipmakers were hit as sentiment were grim 
in the wake of the crackdown on Huawei.
Concerns about the possible escalation of the US-China trade conflict hung in the air after Google suspended some 
business with Huawei.
Asia-facing stocks including HSBC and Prudential were among the biggest drags on the main index.
In news-driven moves, Coca-Cola HBC, which was seen as a potential buyer for CCBA, slumped nearly seven per 
cent after NYSE-listed Coca-Cola dropped plans to refranchise its Africa bottling business.
Ryanair's London-listed stock fell about five per cent to a four-month low after the low-cost airline reported its 
weakest annual profit four years amid struggles with overcapacity, Brexit and delays in delivery of the Boeing 737 
MAX.
The poor reading dragged down British Airways-owner IAG, Easyjet and Wizz Air.
Among midcaps, a stand-out faller was Madame Tussauds-owner Merlin Entertainments which slipped seven per 
cent on its worst day since last October after a double downgrade by HSBC.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary warned yesterday that the airline would grow as fast as possible, even if it 
meant "painful" cuts to fares to drive out rivals.
Other European airlines have blamed a rise in passenger seat numbers for pushing down prices, but Mr O'Leary 
said Ryanair would "keep the foot to the pedal ... Will it be painful for a year or two? Yes, it will. But will it shake out 
more of the competition? Yes, it will."
Mr O'Leary was speaking as Ryanair posted a 30 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to (EURO)948m in the year to 
March 2019 because of rising fuel costs and losses from its new subsidiary Laudamotion. Excluding the Austrian 
airline, pre-tax profit was (EURO)1.1bn.
Shares in the carrier fell almost 6 per cent after the results were announced, closing 4.6 per cent lower at 
(EURO)10.30.
Mr O'Leary said fast growth in the number of seats on short-haul routes and the shift of the Easter holiday into the 
next financial year had pushed down average fares 6 per cent during the year to (EURO)37.
But because of increased ticket sales arising from the lower fares and strong ancillary revenues, revenue rose 6 per 
cent to (EURO)7.7bn, just ahead of the consensus expectation among analysts.
"With some degree of happiness, we will suck up price falls in the next six to 12 months," Mr O'Leary said.
Ryanair boss lays down fares gauntlet to rivals Airlines
Ryanair's strategy is "load-active", which means filling its planes even at lower fares.
Several other European airlines have also blamed fuel costs, overcapacity and the move of Easter for poor results, 
including easyJet last week.
Mr O'Leary is betting that other airlines - he cited Norwegian and Thomas Cook - will struggle to withstand price 
competition.
Kathryn Leonard, at Numis, said that Ryanair's shares had recovered because "people are willing to accept the fact 
that management has said to expect lower profitability for the next couple of years" in return for gaining market 
share.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary warned yesterday that the airline would grow as fast as possible, even if it 
meant "painful" cuts to fares to drive out rivals.
Other European airlines have blamed a rise in passenger seat numbers for pushing down prices, but Mr O'Leary 
said Ryanair would "keep the foot to the pedal ... Will it be painful for a year or two? Yes, it will. But will it shake out 
more of the competition? Yes, it will."
Mr O'Leary was speaking as Ryanair posted a 30 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to (EURO)948m in the year to 
March 2019 because of rising fuel costs and losses from its new subsidiary Laudamotion. Excluding the Austrian 
airline, pre-tax profit was (EURO)1.1bn.
Shares in the carrier fell almost 6 per cent after the results were announced, closing 4.6 per cent lower at 
(EURO)10.30.
Mr O'Leary said fast growth in the number of seats on short-haul routes and the shift of the Easter holiday into the 
next financial year had pushed down average fares 6 per cent during the year to (EURO)37.
But because of increased ticket sales arising from the lower fares and strong ancillary revenues, revenue rose 6 per 
cent to (EURO)7.7bn, just ahead of the consensus expectation among analysts.
"With some degree of happiness, we will suck up price falls in the next six to 12 months," Mr O'Leary said.
Ryanair boss lays down fares gauntlet to rivals; Airlines
Ryanair's strategy is "load-active", which means filling its planes even at lower fares.
Several other European airlines have also blamed fuel costs, overcapacity and the move of Easter for poor results, 
including easyJet last week.
Mr O'Leary is betting that other airlines - he cited Norwegian and Thomas Cook - will struggle to withstand price 
competition.
Kathryn Leonard, at Numis, said that Ryanair's shares had recovered because "people are willing to accept the fact 
that management has said to expect lower profitability for the next couple of years" in return for gaining market 
share.

Among steeplechase horse races, the British Grand National ranks as one of the toughest endurance tests for man 
and animal. Michael O'Leary's horse won in April for a second year running.
Similarly, Mr O'Leary expects his airline, Ryanair, can outlast its highercost rivals by expanding his fleet to reach 
200m customers by 2024, up nearly half. That will not come cheap.
Ryanair as frontrunner on costs was long taken for granted. Punters will have started to lay off bets as the airline's 
operating margins have dropped. Yesterday's full-year results report underscored that. Profitability fell to 13 per 
cent in the year to March, down more than 10 percentage points in 12 months, and the lowest in five years. That 
partly explains a 12 times price to forward earnings multiple, at the lower end of its 10-year range.
Paying more for plane jockeys and fuel got the blame. The latter pressure comes and goes. Longstanding fuel 
hedging means this is unlikely to be a threat. However, unionising staff is relatively new for Ryanair, and for its 
shareholders. Leaping over those staff costs gets tougher each year, up 17 per cent annually for the past three 
years.
Delays to deliveries of the Boeing 737 Max only added to the woes as hopedfor cost savings from a larger, more 
fuel-efficient plane will come later than planned. Traders tore up their betting slips watching Ryanair's shares sink 
more than 5 per cent early on. The stock has gone nowhere for four years.
Mr O'Leary can point to some wins.
Ryanair : jockey clubbed Twitter : @FTLex
Selling stuff to folks trapped on his flights, or to those wanting to store luggage in the hold, still brings in income. 
This profitable ancillary revenue rose nearly a fifth to (EURO)2.4bn last year. It offset the rises in expenses 
elsewhere. Good, but Bernstein says there are questions over prospects at Ryanair's core, excluding growth from 
regional carriers Lauda and Buzz.
An outlook for after-tax profits of as much as a quarter off on 2018/19 gives little reason to cheer. Mr O'Leary needs 
to use his whip hand more on costs.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary warned yesterday that the airline would grow as fast as possible, even if it 
meant "painful" cuts to fares to drive out rivals from the market.
Other European airlines have blamed a rise in passenger seats for pushing down prices, but Mr O'Leary said 
Ryanair would "keep the foot to the pedal ... Will it be painful for a year or two? Yes, it will. But will it shake out more 
of the competition? Yes, it will."
Mr O'Leary was speaking as Ryanair posted a 30 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to (EURO)948m in the year to 
March 2019 because of rising fuel costs and losses from its new subsidiary Laudamotion. Excluding the Austrian 
airline, pre-tax profit was (EURO)1.1bn.
Mr O'Leary said fast growth in the number of seats on short-haul and the shift of the Easter holiday into the next 
financial year had pushed down fares 6 per cent during the year to (EURO)37.
But because of the lower fares and strong ancillary revenues - extras on top of the ticket price - revenue rose 6 per 
cent to (EURO)7.7bn, just ahead of the consensus expectation among analysts.
"With some degree of happiness, we will suck up price falls in the next six to 12 months," Mr O'Leary said. 
Ryanair's strategy was "load-active", meaning filling its planes even at lower fares. Several other European airlines 
have also blamed fuel costs, overcapacity, and the move of Easter for poor results, including easyJet last week.
Ryanair boss throws down fares gauntlet to sector rivals Airlines
Mr O'Leary is betting that other airlines - he cited Norwegian and Thomas Cook - will struggle to withstand 
competition from low prices, given other problems, and it would be "seismic" in terms of market capacity if they 
failed.
Kathryn Leonard, an analyst at Numis, said Ryanair shares had dropped on below-consensus guidance for 2020. 
They recovered because "people are willing to accept the fact that management has said to expect lower 
profitability for the next couple of years" in return for gaining share as the European sector consolidates.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had postponed delivery of about 50 Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, which have been grounded 
after two fatal crashes, and would start taking them in November, assuming they had been approved by regulators.
"Our sense is that the Max will be back flying in North America by the end of June or sometime in July," Mr O'Leary 
said, adding that EASA, Europe's aviation safety agency, "will take another month".
He said the group would have use of the Max 8s for "as little as two or three months" of this year, rather than the 
planned six, nor would it benefit from planned cost savings with the plane until 2021.
Post-tax profit excluding Laudamotion came in at (EURO)1.02bn, at the low end of Ryanair's guidance after a 
January profit warning. Fuel costs rose 23 per cent to (EURO)2.4bn, while staff costs increased 28 per cent to 
(EURO)945m as new pay deals with pilot and cabin crew unions came into effect.
The group announced a (EURO)700m share buyback programme, amounting to a total of nearly (EURO)7bn 
returned to shareholders since 2008.
In the year to March 2020, Mr O'Leary said Ryanair's outlook "remains cautious on pricing" and that group profit 
would be "broadly flat", between (EURO)750m and (EURO)950m. He warned that Ryanair's fuel bill would rise by 
(EURO)460m, or 19 per cent, to (EURO)2.9bn.

IRISH budget airline Ryanair said yesterday its full year profit fell 29 per cent to (EURO)1bn (£890m), which it 
blamed on a fall in fares, issuing a "cautious" warning on profit for the year to come.
Its shares fell nearly five per cent to (EURO)10.29.
The airline said traffic grew seven per cent to 139m passengers in the 12 months to the end of March, but said this 
was offset by a six per cent decline in fares.
Revenue rose six per cent to (EURO)7.6bn thanks to the rise in passengers, but the cut in average fares meant 
Ryanair earned just (EURO)37 per ticket.
It said ancillary revenue grew 19 per cent to (EURO)2.4bn, but said this was offset by higher fuel and staff costs.
Ryanair warned profit in the year to come will land somewhere between (EURO)750m and (EURO)950m, down on 
a company poll of analyst expectations of (EURO)977m.
Ryanair had previously cut its profit forecast for the year by around a fifth in two profit warnings in October and 
January, blaming higher oil prices, strikes and overcapacity.
Neil Wilson of www.Markets.com said: "Today's full-year numbers and outlook cement the view that it's a tough 
space to be in right now - although we would hope that summer 2019 will be the worst of it."
Ryanair's woes led to a wider sell-off of airline and travel stocks yesterday.
Anglo-German travel company Tui's shares lost 6.5 per cent yesterday to close down at 774p.
Ryanair profit down sharply in gloomy market
Shares in rival budget airline Easyjet shed more than 3.5 per cent yesterday to close at 988p, while Thomas Cook 
shares continued their fall, closing down 15 per cent at 10p.

Ryanair Shares Drop After Fiscal 2020 Pre-Tax Profit Guided Lower Due to Continuing Pressure on Fares
Ryanair Shares Drop After Fiscal 2020 Pre-Tax Profit Guided Lower Due to 
Continuing Pressure on Fares

 Shares of Europe's biggest budget airline Ryanair (RYA.L) traded lower early on Monday after the carrier warned 
of lower earnings in fiscal 2020 after higher fuel costs and lower fares led to a 29% plunge in pre-tax profit for the 
year ended March.
Sales grew to 7.56 billion euros ($8.44 billion) during the 12 months that ended March 31, from 7.15 billion euros a 
year ago as traffic rose by 7%, the Dublin, Ireland-based group said in a statement. The increase in traffic was due 
to a 6% drop in fares driven mainly by short-haul capacity growth and the absence of Easter in the fourth quarter.
Ryanair's ex-fuel unit costs rose by 5% -- better than previously guided 6% -- following a 200 million-euro jump in 
staff costs and a 50 million-euro increase in expenses related to "repeated" Air Traffic Control staff shortage 
disruptions. The firm, which is 90% hedged for fiscal 2020 at $709 per tonne and 35% hedged for the first quarter of 
fiscal 2021 at $654, said its oil bill shot up by 440 million euros.
As a result, Ryanair, which said it has the lowest unit costs of any airline in the European Union, reported a drop in 
profit before tax to 1.02 billion euros, from 1.45 billion euros a year ago, even as the load factor climbed by 100 
basis points to 96%.
Looking ahead, the group said its outlook for fiscal 2020 was "cautious" due to the pressure on fares, which are 
expected to push up traffic by 8%. While first-half bookings are slightly ahead of last year, fares are lower and this 
trend is expected to continue through the rest of this year, which will also see costs rise as fuel bill is set to jump by 
another 460 million euros, the firm added.
Ryanair's pre-tax profit for fiscal 2020 is expected to range from 750 million euros to 950 million euros, down from a 
year ago, as delays in the delivery of Boeing's (BA) 737 MAX -- an aircraft in which Ryanair has "utmost" 
confidence but does not see benefits accruing from it before 2021 -- will contribute to the increase in group costs 
excluding fuel.
Ryanair Shares Drop After Fiscal 2020 Pre-Tax Profit Guided Lower Due to Continuing Pressure on Fares
Shares of the airline, whose board has approved a 700-million-euro share buyback over the next 9 to 12 months, 
traded almost 6% lower at the time of writing in London.

LONDON BRIEFING: Ryanair Warns Of "Zero Visibility" Beyond Few Months

 Ryanair Holdings on Monday reported a significant fall in annual profit due to increased fuel, airport and staff costs, 
and it said it has "zero" visibility on its likely results beyond the first half of the current year.
More positively, Ryanair announced a EUR700 million share buyback to run over the next 9 to 12 months.
For the financial year that ended March 31, the Irish budget airline reported pretax profit of EUR948.1 million, down 
41% from EUR1.61 billion the year prior. This included a pretax loss of EUR182.7 million at Lauda, Ryanair's 
Austrian airline established by former Formula 1 champion Niki Lauda and acquired by Ryanair in December.
Group revenue rose 6% to EUR7.69 billion from EUR7.15 billion, with an increase in both scheduled and ancillary 
revenue.
Fuel & oil costs rose 23% to EUR2.42 billion from EUR1.90 billion, staff costs increased 28% to EUR945.0 million 
from EUR738.5 million, and airport charges rose 9% to EUR1.02 billion from EUR938.6 million, hurting profit.
"As previously guided, Ryanair, excluding Lauda, reports a full year after tax profit of EUR1.02 billion. Short-haul 
capacity growth and the absence of Easter in the fourth quarter led to a 6% fare decline, which stimulated 7% traffic 
growth to over 139 million," Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary commented.
During the year, Ryanair saw a 7% increase in traffic - meaning the number of passengers carries - to 139.1 million 
from 130.3 million. Load factor - a key measure for the airline industry - rose by one point to 96%.
Looking ahead, the airline expects traffic to rise 8% in financial 2020 to 153 million passengers. However, assuming 
revenue per passenger growth of 3%, Ryanair guided for broadly flat group profit, including Lauda. This will range 
from EUR750 million if RPP rises 2%, up to EUR950 million if RPP rises 4%.
"While first half bookings are slightly ahead of last year, fares are lower and we expect this trend will continue 
through Summer 2019. We have zero second half visibility," the company added.
Ryanair shares were down 5.6% in early dealings Monday.

 Stock prices in London are seen opening higher on Monday amid mixed trading in Asia, ahead of another busy 
week of company earnings reports and elections to the European Parliament in the UK and elsewhere.
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open up 11.68 points at 7,360.30. The blue-chip index closed down 
4.89 points, or 0.1%, at 7,348.62 on Friday. 
"European markets look set to open slightly higher in the wake of this mixed Asia session, in a week of some 
important continent wide elections," said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. 
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index is up 0.3%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is down 0.9%, while the Hang Seng 
index in Hong Kong is down 0.7%
Japan's gross domestic product climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.5% on quarter in the first quarter of 2019, the 
Cabinet Office said in Monday's preliminary reading.
That beat forecasts for a fall 0.1% and was up from the downwardly revised 0.4% gain in the three months prior, 
which was originally reported as 0.5%. On an annualized yearly basis, GDP was up 2.1% - again exceeding 
expectations for a fall of 0.2% following the downwardly revised 1.6% gain in the previous three months - originally 
1.9%.
In the US on Friday, Wall Street ended lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.4%, S&P 500 down 
0.6% and Nasdaq Composite ending 1.0% lower.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2735 early Monday, flat against USD1.2737 at the London equities close Friday. 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May is preparing to make a "bold offer" to members of Parliament in a final attempt to 
get her beleaguered Brexit deal through Parliament and onto the statue book before she leaves office.
LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Stocks Higher As Earnings Season Continues
Minister will begin discussions on Monday on a package of measures to be included in the forthcoming Withdrawal 
Agreement Bill aimed at securing cross-party support. The weekly meeting of the Cabinet on Tuesday will then 
consider plans for a series of "indicative votes" in the Commons to establish which proposals could command a 
majority in the House.
The move follows the final collapse on Friday of cross-party talks with Labour aimed at finding an agreed way 
forward which would allow Britain to leave the EU with a deal.
"As it becomes clearer that Prime Minister Theresa May's premiership is in its final death throes attention is shifting 
to a number of different outcomes, including but not confined to, who her successor is likely to be, the collapse of 
the government, a new election and the prospect of a possible minority Labour government," added Hewson. 
Ryanair Holdings early Monday reported a significant fall in its annual profit due to increased fuel, airport and staff 
costs.
For the financial year that ended March 31, the Irish budget airline reported pretax profit of EUR948.1 million, down 
41% from EUR1.61 billion the year prior. This included a pretax loss of EUR182.7 million at Lauda, Ryanair's 
Austrian airline established by former Formula 1 champion Niki Lauda and acquired by Ryanair in December.
Group revenue rose 6% to EUR7.69 billion from EUR7.15 billion, with an increase in both scheduled and ancillary

from EUR738.5 million, and airport charges rose 9% to EUR1.02 billion from EUR938.6 million, hurting profit.
The corporate calendar on Monday also has annual results from shipping services provider Braemar Shipping 
Services. There is also third-quarter results from IT infrastructure provider Softcat. 
On Tuesday this week, there are full-year results from car parts retailer Halfords Group and half-year results from 
sandwich maker Greencore Group.
On Wednesday, there are annual results from clothing and homewares retailer Marks & Spencer, postal operator 
Royal Mail and energy supplier SSE. On Thursday, water company United Utilities reports annual results. 
The economic events calendar on Monday has Germany producer prices at 0700 BST and eurozone current 
account numbers at 1000 BST. 
Also ahead this week, there are UK inflation readings and US Federal Reserve meeting minutes on Wednesday 
while the European Parliament elections take place on Thursday.

 Stock prices in London were seen opening higher on Monday amid mixed trading in Asia, ahead of another busy 
week of company earnings reports and politically sensitive elections to the European Parliament.
In early company news, Ryanair Holdings annual profit slumped 40% on higher fuel costs, Softcat said trading 
remains in line with expectations, and Provident Financial received the backing of one of its major shareholders in 
its ongoing battle with Non-Standard Finance. WYG agreed to a GBP43.4 million takeover.
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open up 11.68 points at 7,360.30. The blue-chip index closed down 
4.89 points, or 0.1%, at 7,348.62 on Friday.
Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings reported a significant fall in its annual profit due to increased fuel, airport and staff 
costs.
For the financial year that ended March 31, the Irish budget airline reported pretax profit of EUR948.1 million, down 
41% from EUR1.61 billion the year prior. This included a pretax loss of EUR182.7 million at Lauda, Ryanair's

from EUR738.5 million, and airport charges rose 9% to EUR1.02 billion from EUR938.6 million, hurting profit.
Estate agent Foxtons Group, ahead of its annual general meeting, said its first quarter performance was in line with 
the board's expectations.
For the quarter ended March 31, revenue was GBP23.8 million compared to GBP24.5 million in the first quarter last 
year.

The company said revenue in its sales business declined as conditions in the London property market remains 
"very challenging". 
Moreover, Foxtons said sales volumes continue to be at record low levels and ongoing Brexit uncertainty is hurting 
consumer confidence. Revenue in its lettings business was marginally ahead of the prior year, continuing its 
progress following the initiatives the company implemented in 2018. 
Subprime lender Provident Financial received the backing of one of its prominent shareholders as it fends off the 
advances of smaller peer Non-Standard Finance.
Asset manager Schroders, which holds a 15% stake in Provident, reiterated its view that Non-Standard Finance's 
offer is not in the best interest of Provident shareholders. 
Last week, Non-Standard Finance said its offer for Provident Financial has become unconditional.
"We remain of the view that it is in the best interests of those Provident Financial shareholders who are not also 
shareholders in Non-Standard Finance to reject the NSF offer and continue to hold premium listed PFG stock, 
confident in the protection for minority shareholders that this provides," said Kevin Murphy, fund manager at 
Schroders.
IT infrastructure and services provide Softcat said it has continued to perform well in its third quarter and has 
delivered strong year-on-year growth across its income and profit measures.
Softcat said it is confident in delivering annual results "slightly" ahead of expectations.
Project management consultant WYG has agreed to GBP43.4 million all-cash takeover offer from Tetra Tech. The 
55 pence per share offer has acceptances representing 72.5% of WYG shares, it said.
WYG said the combination with Tetra Tech will create a premier international consulting, engineering and project 
management firm.

 Travel stocks were among the worst performers at the start of the week following disappointing results from 
Ryanair, as London stocks in general saw broad-based losses amid continuation of US-China trade spat.
The FTSE 100 was down 54.06 points, or 0.7%, at 7,294.56 Monday midday. The mid-cap FTSE 250 was down 
139.54 points, or 0.7%, at 19,359.07. The AIM All-Share was down 0.1% at 958.20.
The Cboe UK 100 index was down 0.8% at 12,369.86. The Cboe UK 250 was down 0.7% at 17,393.69, though the 
Cboe UK Small Companies was flat at 11,848.70.
"News that the decision to implement auto tariffs would be delayed caused a recovery into the end of last week, but 
this morning we received a timely reminder that this could well get worse before it gets better," commented David 
Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB.
Alphabet Inc's Google confirmed it has blocked Huawei from updating some parts of its Android software used on 
Huawei phones to comply with a US government order blacklisting the Chinese firm.
The tech giant said it was "complying with the order and reviewing the implications", but assured Huawei users that 
their current phones would continue to work.
Last week, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively banning the Chinese firm from using 
US technology without government permission.
Meanwhile, the UK Government has said it is yet to make a decision on whether to allow another part of Huawei's 
business, its telecoms equipment, to be a part of new 5G networks in the UK.
Remaining in the UK, the contest to succeed Prime Minister Theresa May is hotting up, with potential leadership 
candidates setting out their stalls.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock refused to rule out a bid for the job, saying he had a "strong view about the sort of 
leader we need". Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has already confirmed he will stand in the race to replace 
May, which is due to officially begin within weeks.
The prime minister will set out the timetable for her exit and the leadership contest to succeed her after a crunch 
vote on the legislation for her Brexit deal in early June.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2739 at midday, broadly unchanged from USD1.2737 late Friday.
In European equities, the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt were down 1.2% and 1.3% respectively. 
In the US, Wall Street is on track for a downbeat start to the week. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 are both called 
down 0.1%, while the Nasdaq is pointed 0.5% lower. 
Oil was largely unchanged start of the week, quoted at USD72.62 Monday midday versus USD72.60 late Friday 
amid further deterioration in US-Iranian relations. 
The price of Brent had surpassed USD73 a barrel overnight before falling back in morning trade.
US President Donald Trump vowed Sunday to deny Tehran nuclear weapons just hours after threatening it would 
"be the official end of Iran" when the country's Revolutionary Guard said it was not afraid of war.
"If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the US again!" Trump wrote on Twitter, 
seemingly in response to comments Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Hossein Salami made earlier in the 
day.
Tensions have been escalating between the two countries since Tehran announced it would begin a partial 
withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal, from which Washington pulled out of last year.
"With Donald Trump threatening the Iran's aggression towards the US would see 'the end' of the Islamic Republic, 
there was plenty reasoning behind the weekend gap higher. However, we are also seeing cracks in the OPEC+ 
story, with the Russians talking about a potential easing of the output restrictions," said Joshua Mahony, senior 
market analyst at IG.
"Saudi threats that any relaxing of the current production levels could spark a glut of oil on the market have certainly 
raised concerns amongst crude traders, with prices falling in early trade today," he added.
As well as a volatile oil price hitting travel stocks - on fears of higher fuel prices - disappointing guidance from 
budget airline Ryanair.
Irish carrier Ryanair, down 2.5% at midday, reported a 41% fall in annual profit to EUR948.1 million despite revenue 
rising 6% to EUR7.69 billion.
Looking ahead, the airline expects traffic to rise 8% in financial 2020 to 153 million passengers. However, assuming 
revenue per passenger growth of 3%, Ryanair guided for broadly flat group profit, including Lauda. This will range 
from EUR750 million if revenue per passenger rises 2%, up to EUR950 million if revenue per passenger rises 4%. 
"While first half bookings are slightly ahead of last year, fares are lower and we expect this trend will continue 
through Summer 2019. We have zero second half visibility," the company added.
Ryanair's results hit other airlines in a negative read-across, with FTSE 100 constituents TUI and easyJet down 
3.7% and 1.3% respectively. 
Beleaguered travel agent Thomas Cook was down 18%, furthering Friday's 40% slide after analysts at Citigroup cut 
the stock's price target to zero following a sharply wider interim loss. 
In the FTSE 250, Merlin Entertainments slipped 6.2% after HSBC cut the Legoland owner to Reduce from Buy.

Also hurting from a rating downgrade was Metro Bank, lowered to Sell from Hold by Investec. 
This comes following a turbulent period for the challenger bank, as it last week raised more than initially anticipated 
after being hit by macroeconomic difficulties, such as regulatory changes and a low-interest rate environment, as 
well as "company-specific factors".
In January, the lender announced it had underestimated the risk on its commercial loans and needed to raise 
capital to compensate for the shortfall.
Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings, meanwhile, motored to the top of the mid-caps as Bernstein boosted the 
luxury car maker to Outperform from Market Perform. 
IT infrastructure firm Softcat rose 1.9% as the firm said its annual results are expected to be "slightly ahead" of prior 
expectations. The FTSE 250 constituent said it continued to preform well in the three months to April 30, delivering 
"strong year-on-year growth" across all income and profit measures.

"Performance drivers remained broad-based, with different technology areas and customer segments all showing 
growth," Softcat said. The company added that progress towards the opening of a new office in Birmingham is "well 
advanced". It expects the opening to occur early in the next financial year.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK Prime Minister Theresa May is set to begin discussions with senior ministers on her proposed new "bold offer" 
to members of Parliament in a final attempt to get her Brexit deal through Parliament. The weekly meeting of the 
Cabinet on Tuesday is expected to sign off on a package of measures to be included in the forthcoming Withdrawal 
Agreement Bill aimed at winning cross-party support. However there was widespread scepticism at Westminster 
that it will fare any better than her three previous failed attempts to get the Commons to pass the deal. Following 
the collapse last week of cross-party talks with Labour aimed at reaching a common approach, Jeremy Corbyn said

Alphabet Inc's Google has confirmed it has blocked Huawei from updating some parts of its Android software used 
on Huawei phones to comply with a US government order blacklisting the Chinese firm. The tech giant said it was 
"complying with the order and reviewing the implications", but assured Huawei users that their current phones

would continue to work. Last week, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively banning the 
Chinese firm from using US technology without government permission. "For users of our services, Google Play 
and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices," a 
Google spokesman said. The block is likely to prevent future updates to Android reaching Huawei devices. Key 
Google apps such as the Google Play Store, Gmail and Google Maps may also not appear on future Huawei 
devices. Instead, the Chinese firm would be reliant on the version of Android available through an open source 
licence, which is vastly more limited in its features.

US President Donald Trump vowed Sunday to deny Tehran nuclear weapons just hours after threatening it would 
"be the official end of Iran" when the country's Revolutionary Guard said it was not afraid of war. "I will not let Iran 
have nuclear weapons," Trump told Fox News. "I don't want to fight. But you do have situations like Iran, you can't 
let them have nuclear weapons - you just can't let that happen," he said. Prior to the interview Trump had appeared 
to escalate the growing threat of conflict when he used social media to respond to Iran's Revolutionary Guard 
saying it was not afraid of war. "If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the US 
again!" Trump wrote on Twitter, seemingly in response to comments Revolutionary Guard Corps commander 
Hossein Salami made earlier in the day.

 Stock prices in London opened mixed on Monday, with oil majors among the best performers in the FTSE 100 on a 
firm oil price and rising tensions between the US and Iran, while airlines fell after Ryanair reported a drop in annual 
profit. 
The FTSE 100 was up 7.30 points, or 0.1%, at 7,355.92. The FTSE 250 was down 19.71 points, or 0.1% at 
19,478.90. The AIM All-Share was up 0.1% at 960.10.
The Cboe UK 100 index was up 0.1% at 12,475.79. The Cboe UK 250 was down 0.1% at 17,503.40, and the Cboe 
UK Small Companies was flat at 11,850.56.
In European equities, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.2% and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was down 0.1%. 
In the FTSE 100, oil majors were the best performer, tracking spot oil prices higher, quoted at USD73.20 Monday, 
up from USD72.60 at the London equities close Friday.
Royal Dutch Shell 'A' and 'B' shares were both up 0.7% and BP was up 0.6%. Shell is London's biggest company 
by market capitalisation, while BP is third.
Oil prices were higher after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih indicated there was consensus among OPEC and 
allied oil producers to continue limiting supplies.
London Capital Group's Jasper Lawler commented: "Oil has already rallied around 40% since the start of the year, 
thanks mainly to OPEC limiting supply. Investors had been growing nervous that OPEC could look to remove the 
production limits at its next meeting in June, in light of tightening global supply and elevated prices. 
"Whilst the OPEC production cuts have offered significant support to oil prices, US sanctions on Iran and 
Venezuela have also played a role. Add into the equation rising Middle Eastern tensions, as Iran retaliates to US 
measures and oil looks well supported at these levels."
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Oil Stocks Lift FTSE 100; Ryanair Grounds Airlines
At the other end of the large cap index, airline stocks were the worst performers following disappointing annual 
results from Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings. 
Ryanair shares were down 6.4%. easyJet was down 2.5% and British Airways-parent International Consolidated 
Airlines Group was down 1.5%.
Ryanair reported a significant fall in annual profit due to increased fuel, airport and staff costs, and it said it has 
"zero" visibility on its likely results beyond the first half of the current year.
For the financial year ended March 31, the Irish budget airline reported pretax profit of EUR948.1 million, down 41% 
from EUR1.61 billion the year prior. This included a pretax loss of EUR182.7 million at Lauda, Ryanair's Austrian 
airline established by former Formula 1 champion Niki Lauda and acquired by Ryanair in December.
Fuel & oil costs rose 23% to EUR2.42 billion from EUR1.90 billion, staff costs increased 28% to EUR945.0 million 
from EUR738.5 million, and airport charges rose 9% to EUR1.02 billion from EUR938.6 million, hurting profit.
In the FTSE 250, Aston Martin Lagonda was the best performer, up 4.6% after Bernstein raised the luxury sports 
car maker to Outperform from Market Perform. 
At the other end of the midcap index, Merlin Entertainments was the worst performer, down 4.8% after HSBC 
downgraded the amusement park and attractions operator to Reduce from Buy. 
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.2%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.9%, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.7%
Japan's gross domestic product climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.5% on quarter in the first quarter of 2019, the 
Cabinet Office said in Monday's preliminary reading.
That beat forecasts for a fall 0.1% and was up from the downwardly revised 0.4% gain in the three months prior, 
which was originally reported as 0.5%. On an annualized yearly basis, GDP was up 2.1% - again exceeding 
expectations for a fall of 0.2% following the downwardly revised 1.6% gain in the previous three months - originally 
1.9%.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2732 Monday, flat against USD1.2737 at the London equities close Friday.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May is set to begin discussions with senior ministers on her proposed new "bold offer" 
to members of Parliament in a final attempt to get her Brexit deal through Parliament.
The weekly meeting of the Cabinet on Tuesday is expected to sign off on a package of measures to be included in 
the forthcoming Withdrawal Agreement Bill aimed at winning cross-party support.
However, there was widespread scepticism at Westminster that it will fare any better than her three previous failed 
attempts to get the Commons to pass the deal.
Following the collapse last week of cross-party talks with Labour aimed at reaching a common approach, opposition 
leader Jeremy Corbyn said he had not yet seen anything new that would persuade him to support it.
"Politics will continue to hog the lime-light in the UK in the coming week, although all indications now are that 
Theresa May will eschew the series of indicative Brexit votes in Parliament that was at one stage mooted for the 
first half of this week. With the next key Brexit event now likely to be the 'second reading' vote on May's Withdrawal 
Agreement Bill in the week commencing 3 June, all eyes this week will be on the European Parliament election on 
Thursday, which looks set to see May's Conservatives humiliated," said analysts at Daiwa Capital Markets. 
The economic events calendar on Monday has eurozone current account numbers at 1000 BST.

 London stocks started the new week on the back foot following another knock back for Chinese tech giant Huawei 
amid an ongoing US-Sino trade saga.
Travel stocks also played a role in denting the FTSE 100's performance on Monday after some ill-received 
guidance from budget airline Ryanair knocked peers in a negative read-across. 
However, London's blue-chip index managed to avoid the sharper loss of its European peers as the pound 
remained weak ahead of the likely return of UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal deal in June. 
The FTSE 100 index closed down 37.74 points, or 0.5%, at 7,310.88. The FTSE 250 ended down 163.02 points, or 
0.8%, at 19,335.59, and the AIM All-Share closed down 1.68 points, or 0.2%, at 957.01.
The Cboe UK 100 ended down 0.6% at 12,386.37, the Cboe UK 250 closed down 0.8% at 17,375.66, and the Cboe 
Small Companies ended down 0.1% at 11,840.44.
In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris ended down 1.5%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended 
down 1.6%.
"European stocks plummeted on Monday, as investors reacted to escalating US-Sino trade tensions. Google 
halting supplies to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei amid a White House ban has intensified the risk-off sentiment," 
said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index. 
Alphabet Inc's Google confirmed it has blocked Huawei from updating some parts of its Android software used on 
Huawei phones to comply with a US government order blacklisting the Chinese firm.
Last week, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively banning the Chinese firm from using 
US technology without government permission. This came after the US increased tariffs to 25% on USD200 billion 
worth of Chinese products.

However, the dollar earner-heavy FTSE 100 posted less severe falls compared to European counterparts "thanks 
to cushioning from the pound", Cincotta noted. 
The pound was quoted at USD1.2731 at the London equities close Monday, soft compared to USD1.2737 at the 
close on Friday.

The weekly meeting of the Cabinet on Tuesday is expected to sign off on a package of measures to be included in 
the forthcoming Withdrawal Agreement Bill aimed at winning cross-party support.
However, there was widespread scepticism at Westminster that it will fare any better than her three previous failed

Following the collapse last week of cross-party talks with Labour aimed at reaching a common approach, Jeremy 
Corbyn said he had not yet seen anything new that would persuade him to support it.
This comes at the start of what is likely to be another torrid week for the prime minister with the Conservatives 
braced for a thrashing at the hands of Nigel Farage's Brexit Party in the European elections on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Conservative members of Parliament have begun to throw their hats in the ring for May's job as she 
prepares to set out her own departure plan. 
Health Secretary Matt Hancock refused to rule out a bid for the job, saying he had a "strong view about the sort of 
leader we need". Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has already confirmed he will stand in the race to replace 
May, which is due to officially begin within weeks.
The prime minister will set out the timetable for her exit and the leadership contest to succeed her after her Brexit 
deal goes to the Commons for a fourth time in early June.
The euro stood at USD1.1169 at the European equities close Monday, against USD1.1160 at the same time on 
Friday.
Stocks in New York were trading in the red at the London equities close, with the DJIA down 0.3%, the S&P 500 
index down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 1.2%. 
In London, travel firms ended the session among the worst performers after a disappointing outlook from Irish 
airline Ryanair, as the firm warned it has "zero" visibility on the second half. 
Ryanair closed down 4.6%.
The budget flier reported a 41% fall in annual profit to EUR948.1 million despite revenue rising 6% to EUR7.15 
billion.
Looking ahead, the airline expects traffic to rise 8% in its recently-begun financial year to 153 million passengers. 
However, assuming revenue per passenger growth of 3%, Ryanair guided for broadly flat group profit. 
This will range from EUR750 million if revenue per passenger rises 2%, up to EUR950 million if revenue per 
passenger rises 4%. 
"While first half bookings are slightly ahead of last year, fares are lower and we expect this trend will continue 
through summer 2019. We have zero second half visibility," the company added.
Ryanair's results hit other travel stocks in a negative read-across, with FTSE 100 members TUI and easyJet 
shedding 6.2% and 3.5% respectively, while Wizz Air in the FTSE 250 declined 2.0%. 
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: Huawei Blow And Ryanair Woe Puts Pressure On FTSE
Travel agent Thomas Cook came close to 2011's record low of 8.11 pence, finishing the session down 13% at 
10.25p as it extended last week's losses. 
In morning trade on Monday, the stock hit 8.33p per share. 
Last week, Thomas Cook posted an underlying loss before interest and tax loss of GBP245 million versus a loss of 
GBP170 million a year ago. Looking ahead, the firm said it now expects underlying Ebit in the second half to be 
behind the same period a year ago due to margin pressure.
Following the results, Citigroup cut the stock to Sell from Neutral and wiped its price target to 0p.
Back in the FTSE 100, Land Securities fell 1.6% after Liberum cut the property investor and developer to Hold from 
Buy.
A ratings downgrade saw Merlin Entertainments end as the biggest loser in the FTSE 250, sinking 6.7% after HSBC 
cut the Thorpe Park operator to Reduce from Buy. 
Elsewhere on the Main Market, Low & Bonar sank 24% on the impending departure of its chief executive and news 
that its performance in the first half of its financial year will be "materially behind" a year before.
Philip de Klerk will step down as CEO on July 1 and the company will promote Non-Executive Chair Daniel Dayan 
to executive chair on July 2. The company does not plan to seek a new CEO straight away, but will review the 
situation "later in the year".
The performance materials firm also said it has made a slower recovery than expected in its second quarter, which 
ends May 31. This was attributed to continued market weakness and "the slow recovery of customer confidence" 
within its Coated Technical Textiles unit, which creates modified fabrics for outdoor use.
In the UK corporate calendar on Tuesday, there are annual results from electronics product distributor 
Electrocomponents, car parts and bike retailer Halfords, emergency repairs firm Homeserve and food producer 
Cranswick.
There are third-quarter results from books and stationery retailer WH Smith and a trading statement from gold miner 
Fresnillo. 
In commodities, gold was quoted at USD1,276.80 an ounce at the London equities close Monday against 
USD1,275.10 at the close on Friday.
Brent oil, meanwhile, was quoted at USD72.56 a barrel at the London equities close Monday from USD72.60 late 
Friday.
In the economic calendar on Tuesday, the Confederation of British Industry's Industrial Trends survey is at 1100

Ryanair profit hits four year low
Ryanair profit hits four year low

Ryanair reported its weakest annual profit in four years on Monday and said earnings could fall further next year as 
Europe suffers what chief executive Michael O'Leary described as "attritional fare wars."
But he said he expected Europe's short-haul sector to consolidate and fares to rise within five years.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier, which had already flagged a sharp fall in profitability in two warnings last year, 
saw after-tax profits fall to 1.02 billion euros for its financial year to March 31 from 1.45 billion euros the previous 
year.
Profit for the year to March 2020, which for the first time will include its recently acquired its loss-making 
Laudamotion unit, will be between 750 million and 950 million euros.
A company poll of over 10 analysts published ahead of the release had forecast an after-tax profit of 1.03 billion 
euros for the year to March 2019 and 977 million for the year to March 2020.
The profit forecast is "disappointing" compared to market expectations, Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said in a note, 
pointing to continued increases in non-fuel costs, forecast by Ryanair to hit 2% in the coming year, as "the main 
disappointment."
Traders said they expect shares in Ryanair to fall between 3-5% in early deals.
Several rival airlines have warned of a worse trading environment - partly due to overcapacity and partly because 
European travelers are holding off booking their summer holidays for fear of how the Brexit process will pan out.
Ryanair profit hits four year low
While O'Leary said he was hopeful that the performance in Britain would improve this summer and fares may be 
stronger across Europe in the winter, he warned investors that the European airline sector was experiencing a 
cyclical fall in profitability.
"Frankly, if we are in a period where there are going to be attritional fare wars... profits will suffer for a year or two 
and I think that is what shareholders should expect," O'Leary said in a video presentation.
"However it is clear in my mind that within the next four of five years we will see the emergence of four or five large 
European airline groups... with much more capacity discipline ...and some upward pressure on pricing," he said.
Ryanair said it expected summer fares to be lower than last year although they could improve in the winter to leave 
fares for the full year to March 2020 between 2% lower and 1% higher than last year.
The Irish airline has also taken a hit from delays in the delivery of Boeing 737 MAX after its worldwide grounding in 
March following a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash.
Ryanair, which has ordered 135 737 MAX 200s and has options on 75 more, was expecting to receive its first five 
planes between April and June but now expects them to by flying by November.
It expects most of the first batch of around 50 aircraft to be flying by next summer, Chief Executive Michel O'Leary 
said.
The grounding has forced Ryanair to cut around 1 million seats in the year to March 2020. But it expects to fly 153 
million passengers in the year to March 2020 up from 139 million this year.
While future orders may be slightly backed up, Ryanair expects to hit its medium-term growth target of 200 million 
passengers by 2024.
The airline plans to have a conversation with Boeing about "modest compensation," Chief Financial Officer Neil 
Sorohan said.
Ryanair's shares closed on Friday at 10.81 euros, down more than 40% from a peak of 19.39 euros 18 months ago, 
before the airline was hit by a wave of industrial unrest, weakness in European short-haul fares and the grounding 
of the MAX.
In what O’Leary described as a vote of confidence from the board, Ryanair will begin a 700 million euro share 
buyback in the coming days. (Reuters)

LONDON (AP) - Budget airline Ryanair says its profit fell 29% last year and warns that the grounding of Boeing's 
737 Max planes will limit its ability to cut costs.
Europe's largest carrier by passengers said earnings for the year ending March 31 fell to 1.02 billion euros ($1.14 
billion) from 1.45 billion euros the previous year. Strong 7% traffic growth was offset by a 6% decline in fares.
Boeing grounded its 737 MAX planes after two crashes raised concerns about flight-control software. It said last 
week it has finished updating the software, though it remains unclear when the grounding will end.
Ryanair had wanted to use the fuel-efficient planes to cut costs. But it delayed delivery of its first five Max planes 
until the winter so those savings won't happen until 2021.

Highlight: Manchester Airport in the UK has resolved a fuel supply problem caused by a power issue and disrupted 
flight delays.
Body
Following a power issue that affected fuel supply, the airport had to cancel 87 flights to destinations including 
Tenerife, Belfast, and Milan. Of the cancelled flights, 42 were arrivals and 45 were departures. 
Dozens of flights were delayed and cancelled, with up to 13,000 passengers impacted. Manchester Airport said in a 
statement on Twitter: "The engineers have now resolved the power issue, which affected the fuel supply. "We 
apologise for any inconvenience caused." The airport further noted that most scheduled flights will operate as 
planned, but a small number of delays and cancellations are expected as a result of the issues experienced. The 
Guardian reported that Ryanair, easyJet, Dart Group owned Jet2 and IAG owned British Airways flights were 
among those affected. Due to these problems, passengers were stuck on grounded planes for two to three hours. 
Some of them were offered hotels after waiting in the terminal. Fuel at most large airports is supplied to aircraft 
through a network of pipes beneath the apron. Initially, it was expected that the system, which was disabled due to 
a power cut, would be restored within a few hours. Most of the planes that were fully boarded waited for a long time 
on the apron. Manchester Airport advised passengers to check the status of their flight with their airline. Last month, 
the airport opened a new £216m pier connected to Terminal 2 (T2) as part of its £1bn transformation programme.

Cook shares takes fall since Thursday to 57%.
Body
Update: The FTSE 100 has fallen into the red, dragged down by house builders after disappointing property price 
data from Rightmove.
The UK blue-chip index fell 34 points, or 0.5%, to 7,314, with builders among the fallers after Rightmove reported a 
2.5% fall in Greater London property prices in the year to May.
Barratt Developments (BDEV) fell 4.3% to 587.2p, Taylor Wimpey (TW) was down 3.1% at 172p, Persimmon 
(PSN) dropped 2.8% to £20.58 and Berkeley (BKGH) traded 2.8% lower at £36.75.
TUI (TUIT) was the heaviest faller on the index, down 6.4% at 775.2p, hurt by the freefall in the shares of embattled 
rival Thomas Cook (TCG), down by a further 16.2% at 9.9p today.
Shares in Thomas Cook have crashed 57% over the last three days after Thursday's profit warning was followed by 
a downgrade on Friday from analysts at Citigroup, who said the shares were worthless.
Coca Cola HBC (CCH) was also in the red, down 6% at £26.91, as the bottling company was hurt by the news that 
Coca-Cola (KO.N) had dropped its plans to refranchise its Africa bottling business. Coca Cola HBG had been seen 
as a potential buyer of the division.
(9:59) Ryanair slumps on falling profits
The FTSE 100 has edged between gains and losses after a rise in the price of Brent crude lifted oil stocks but 
airline companies were led lower by Ryanair's (RYA.I) slump.
The UK blue-chip index fell two points to 7,347, with EasyJet (EZJ) and British Airways owner International 
Airlines Group (ICAG) among the fallers, down 2.4% at £10 and 1.3% lower at 502.2p respectively.
They were knocked by a slump in the shares of Ryanair, down 5.6% at  €10.24 after profits slumped to a four-year 
low and the budget airline group warned earnings could fall further.
Builders turn FTSE red as Thomas Cook keeps crashing
'With full-year profit at the lower end of reduced guidance from January and a gloomy outlook it is little wonder 
budget airline Ryanair is in a tailspin,' said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
'Times are tough for the travel industry. Brexit is affecting consumer sentiment appetite for travel and the operating 
environment for the airlines themselves.'
Airline stocks came under more pressure from the oil price, which rose 0.5% to $72.60 a barrel after the Opec cartel 
of oil-producing nations indicated it was likely to maintain production cuts.
That helped support the shares of oil majors Shell (RDSb) and BP (BP), up 8p at £25.50 and 4p at 559.9p 
respectively.
On the FTSE 250, Merlin Entertainments (MERL) was a heavy faller, down 5.3% to 355.1p after analysts at HSBC 
cut their rating on the amusement parks operator from 'buy' to 'reduce'.
Shares in 'small-cap' stock Low & Bonar (LWB) meanwhile lost a quarter of their value, crashing 24.8% to 10.9p 
after chief executive Philip de Klerk announced his departure following the polymer products maker's second profit 
warning in two months.

Highlight: FTSE 100 edged between gains and losses, receiving support from oil stocks while airlines fall after 
Ryanair's profits slump to four-year low.
Body
The FTSE 100 has edged between gains and losses after a rise in the price of Brent crude lifted oil stocks but 
airline companies were led lower by Ryanair's (RYA.I) slump.
The UK blue-chip index fell two points to 7,347, with EasyJet (EZJ) and British Airways owner International 
Airlines Group (ICAG) among the fallers, down 2.4% at £10 and 1.3% lower at 502.2p respectively.

Ryanair has delayed the delivery of its first five Boeing 737 Max jets to the winter 2019-20 season, as a result of the 
worldwide grounding of the re-engined type.
But the budget carrier insists it has “utmost confidence” in the aircraft.
Ryanair has ordered up to 210 of the aircraft, which will be delivered in a high-density configuration featuring 197 
seats.
Its first five aircraft, due to arrive in summer, will be pushed back to November this year. Another 42 due over the 
winter season will be delivered over the summer of 2020.
Pre-delivery payments have been “frozen”, the carrier states, and it adds that it “expects” Boeing to cover lost 
profits. Ryanair is engaged in talks with the US airframer.
The airline says its revised delivery schedule depends on European Union Aviation Safety Agency approval.
Ryanair says the delayed deliveries means the airline will “not see any meaningful cost benefit” until its 2021 fiscal 
year.
But it states that the aircraft will generate “significant” unit-cost savings for the next five years.

EXTRA: easyJet Shares Take Off Despite Widened Interim Loss
EXTRA: easyJet Shares Take Off Despite Widened Interim Loss

 Shares in low-cost airline easyJet PLC rose on Friday as it kept annual expectations unchanged despite posting a 
sharp widening to its interim loss.
easyJet shares were trading up 3.6% on Friday, with the stock toppling the FTSE 100 index. 
The airline said it saw high-single-digit revenue growth in the first half of its current financial year but loss widened, 
in line with forecasts, due to an increase in fuel costs. 
"Budget airline easyJet becomes the latest travel stock to post a big loss as it reports first half results, but its shares 
are taking off regardless," AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.
He added: "This is reward for the tight control of costs which means despite lower revenue per seat, full year profit 
guidance is unchanged.
"These results were always likely to compare unfavourably with last year's which benefited from scheduling 
problems at main rival Ryanair and the collapse of Monarch Airlines. It is a tough time to be an airline in general 
with rising labour costs, excess capacity and spiralling fuel costs, not to mention the growing pressure on the whole 
concept of flying from environmental campaigners."
Mould concluded: "Against this stormy backdrop, easyJet perhaps has a clearer flight path than some of its peer 
group."
In the six months to March 31, easyJet's pretax loss came in at GBP272 million compared to GBP68 million 
reported for the same period a year earlier.
Fuel cost per seat jumped 14% in the period to GBP13.02 from GBP11.42 the year before, driven by a rise in oil 
prices.
easyJet's total fuel costs increased 31% in the first half to GBP602 million from GBP461 million the year prior. As a 
result, the airline's headline cost per seat increased 3.9% to GBP56.66 from GBP54.53.

Nevertheless, the company's revenue increased 7.3% to GBP2.34 billion from GBP2.18 billion the year before. 
Total revenue per seat, however, was down by 6.3% to GBP50.71 from GBP54.10. 
"easyJet has performed in line with expectations in the first half. I am pleased that despite tougher trading 
conditions, we flew more than 41 million customers, performed well operationally, with 54% fewer cancellations in 
the period and customer satisfaction with our crew is at an all-time high," said Chief Executive Johan Lundgren.  
The total revenue increase was attributed to a growth in capacity, which rose 14% year-on-year to 46.2 million, and 
a foreign exchange benefits. 
Load factor, a key measure for airlines, came in at 90.1%, down from 91.1% the year before. 
However, the company noted that its revenue was negatively impacted by the move of the Easter holiday and 
change to the IFRS 15 accounting standard.
In addition, easyJet said the issues at Gatwick Airport over Christmas caused by an errant drone cost it GBP5 
million in revenue. 
The airline said it had received one-off benefits in the corresponding period a year ago due to the bankruptcy of 
Monarch and Ryanair Holdings PLC "cancelling a large proportion of its winter 2017/8 schedule in the UK". 
Nonetheless, easyJet kept its full-year headline pretax profit expectations unchanged and in line with markets 
expectations. 
Forward bookings for the third quarter are expected to be three percentage points behind last year at 72% and flat 
year-on-year at 34% for the fourth quarter. easyJet's capacity growth in the second half is forecast at about 7%.
Revenue per seat, at constant currency, is expected to be "slightly down" in financial 2019, hurt by the "ongoing 
negative impact" of Brexit as well as a "wider macroeconomic slowdown" in Europe.  
The airline said it was prepared for the UK to leave the EU on March 29, and has 135 aircraft registered in Australia 
and is flying that fleet independently.
Full year headline cost per seat, excluding fuel at constant currency, is also expected to be down.
Meanwhile, reflecting the increase in revenue, and in line with its dividend policy, the airline hiked its interim payout 
43% to 58.6 pence from 40.9p the year before.
"Cost control remains a major priority for easyJet. Our focus is on efficiency and on innovation through data and we 
are on track to deliver more than GPB100 million in cost savings during 2019," said Lundgren. 
easyJet said it most of its savings in the first half came from the reduction in disruption events, which totalled 3,242 
compared to 4,815 a year prior. 
Lundgren added: "We have invested in the operation by doubling our standby aircraft and changed our schedules 
so that even though the external operating environment over the summer is not set to improve, we plan to alleviate 
the impact on our customers."

 Low-cost airline easyJet PLC said on Friday it saw high-single-digit revenue growth in the first half of its current 
financial year but loss widened, in line with forecasts, due to an increase in fuel costs. 
In the six months to March 31, easyJet's pretax loss widened significantly to GBP272 million compared to a GBP68 
million loss reported for the same period a year earlier.
Fuel cost per seat jumped 14% in the period to GBP13.02 from GBP11.42 the year before, driven by a rise in oil 
prices.
easyJet's total fuel costs increased 31% in the first half to GBP602 million from GBP461 million the year prior. As a 
result, the airline's headline cost per seat increased 3.9% to GBP56.66 from GBP54.53.
Nevertheless, the company's revenue increased 7.3% to GBP2.34 billion from GBP2.18 billion the year before. 
Total revenue per seat, however, was down by 6.3% to GBP50.71 from GBP54.10. 
"easyJet has performed in line with expectations in the first half. I am pleased that despite tougher trading 
conditions, we flew more than 41 million customers, performed well operationally, with 54% fewer cancellations in 
the period and customer satisfaction with our crew is at an all-time high," said Chief Executive Johan Lundgren.  
The total revenue increase was attributed to a growth in capacity, which rose 14% year-on-year to 46.2 million, and 
a foreign exchange benefits. 
Load factor, a key measure for airlines, came in at 90.1%, down 1 percentage point from 91.1%. 
However, the company noted that its revenue was negatively impacted by the move of the Easter holiday and 
change to the IFRS 15 accounting standard.
In addition, easyJet said the issues at Gatwick Airport over Christmas caused by an errant drone cost it GBP5 
million in revenue.

Highlight: Air France, the French flag carrier, is seeking to cut its domestic capacity by 15% by 2021, sacrificing 
historic dominance over the French national network.
Body
Intense competition from high-speed rail and low-cost rivals forced the hand of Air France, announcing 465 job 
losses to scale back its domestic network. The airline admitted it was suffering from "overstaffing in the short-haul 
ground operations activities". Air France outlook 2019The decision has triggered a voluntary redundancy plan for 
465 staff at a works council meeting on 13 May. Consultation with unions and other stakeholders will commence 
soon and there will be "no forced departures". Unemployment has for a while been highly contentious, meaning that 
finding 465 employees who are willing to leave will be an extremely difficult task for Air France to complete. 
Cutting domestic capacity is inevitableAir France's domestic operations reported a loss of EUR189 million ($222 
million) in 2018. Since 2013, Air France has lost a cumulative figure of EUR717 million ($843 million). Higher fuel 
prices and an oversupply of seats are being blamed. However, these impacts could have been managed in a more 
proactive manner. Inaccuracies with regard to in-demand forecasting may be to blame for the size of this loss. Air 
France said that "extremely fierce competition" from the TGV high-speed train service has been mounting, stating 
the company lost 90% of market share on routes where TGV services connect Paris to the provinces. 'No-frills' 
airlines serving the rest of Europe have also exacerbated the French flag carrier's financial woes by implementing 
aggressive pricing policies, often with the help of public authorities. Further cuts may be imminentThe full extent of 
financial troubles at Air France was revealed recently when the company posted a EUR303 million ($356 million) 
first-quarter loss after staff expenses jumped 6.4%. Hop!, the domestic arm of Air France, has been battling 
discount carriers led by EasyJet and Ryanair. Due to the dominance of low-cost airlines in the short-haul industry 
and highly competitive pricing policies from rivals, it is unclear how successfully the sub-brand will continue to 
operate. It may be profitable for Air France to slowly expand the number of international routes the company flies to 
destinations which are currently growing in popularity while decreasing domestic routes and frequency. Such a 
strategy would help to offset the significant, cumulative loss which Air France has experienced in the domestic 
market.

LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Stocks Seen Higher Amid Trade Deal Hopes
LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Stocks Seen Higher Amid Trade Deal 
Hopes

 Stock prices in London are seen opening higher on Tuesday, rebounding from losses on Monday, with investors 
hopeful that the US and China can ultimately agree a trade deal. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open up 17.52 points at 7,181.20. The blue-chip index closed down 
39.61 points, or 0.6%, at 7,163.68 on Monday. 
The US is in a "very strong position" in trade negotiations with China and there is still a chance to complete a deal, 
US President Donald Trump said Monday.
Trump spoke after China announced a retaliatory increase of up to 25% in tariffs on USD60 billion worth of US 
imports starting June 1 as an ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies widened, rattling 
financial markets around the world.
China said the increase would affect products already included in initial tariffs of 5% to 25%. The State Council's 
Customs Tariffs Commission did not make clear, however, which tariffs will be increased by how much, but nearly 
2,500 US products will be hit by the 25% tariff.
The increased duties are a reaction to US unilateralism and trade protectionism, the Beijing authorities said.
Trump said the US is in a better position than China to withstand economic pressure from trade tensions, and 
added that he still has leverage in the form of tariffs on another USD325 billion worth of goods.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index is down 0.7%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.1%, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 1.4%. Markets in Hong Kong reopened after being closed for a public 
holiday on Monday. 
"Despite the heavy falls in Asia we have seen a pullback from the lows, after President Trump kept open the 
prospect of some form of deal in the next 'three to four weeks', when speaking at a White House event, as well as 
LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Stocks Seen Higher Amid Trade Deal Hopes
saying that he was prepared to meet President Xi. This pullback from the lows is likely to see European markets 
open slightly higher this morning, but it is unlikely to change the prospect of further volatility in the days ahead," said 
CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. 
In the US on Monday, Wall Street ended sharply lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 down 
2.4% and Nasdaq Composite ending 3.4% lower.
The UK corporate calendar on Tuesday has annual results from telecommunications firm Vodafone Group and 
property company Land Securities. There are also interim results from holiday company On the Beach Group and 
pub operator Ei Group. 
Vodafone said late Monday it sold its New Zealand subsidiary for EUR2.1 billion to a consortium of New Zealand 
infrastructure investment firm Infratil and Canadian alternative asset manager Brookfield Asset Management.
Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings has paid damages to individual passengers whose flights did not reach their 
destinations on time due to strikes, a Hamburg court said Monday.
In at least five legal proceedings, Ryanair recognized the demands of the plaintiff, a Hamburg court spokesman 
said. Ryanair declined to comment on the proceedings.
The economic events calendar on Tuesday has Germany inflation readings at 0700 BST, UK unemployment data at 
0930 BST and eurozone industrial production figures at 1000 BST. 
The pound was quoted at USD1.2958 early Tuesday, flat against USD1.2960 at the London equities close Monday.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May is under renewed pressure to abandon Brexit talks with Labour amid warnings she 
risks losing the "loyal middle" of the Tory Party if she gives ground on a customs union.
Some 13 former ministers, together with the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, have 
written to the prime minister urging her not to concede Labour's key demand, The Times reported.
Their intervention comes as May prepared to brief senior ministers on the state of the talks - which began in April - 
at the weekly meeting of the Cabinet in Downing Street on Tuesday.

Highlight: Viva Air has received a $50m equity capital injection from global private equity firm Cartesian Capital 
Group to boost its growth and expansion plans.
Body
The US fund made the investment into the airline group's procurement subsidiary. Based in Colombia and Peru, 
Viva Air will use the funding to support its pending deliveries of Airbus A320 aircraft. 
A portion of the investment will be dedicated to the group's continued growth. Cartesian has previously invested in 
airlines such as Gol in Brazil and Flybondi in Argentina. Viva Air president and CEO Felix Antelo said: "The fact that 
an equity firm such as Cartesian selected Viva Air Group for investment confirms the huge progress we have made 
in recent years and the growth opportunities we have developed in the region and benefiting our growing passenger 
numbers year on year." The injection of funds will not alter Irelandia Aviation's position as majority shareholder in 
Viva Air. Irelandia operates low-cost carriers Ryanair, Tiger Airways, Allegiant and VivaAerobus. Irelandia Aviation 
senior partner John Goode said: "We are delighted to have found a partner with the level of experience and calibre 
of Cartesian Capital Group, a globally known engaged investor, whom not only adds capital but also brings 
knowledge and experience and it is a huge vote of confidence in our company and business." The group comprises 
Viva Air Peru and Viva Air Colombia. The airline serves more than 21 destinations and expects to 7.5 million 
passengers this year. The airline placed an order for 50 new aircraft Airbus A-320 CEO and NEO to boost its 
expansion plans. The company is planning to expand to a third country next year. BofA Merrill Lynch advised Viva 
Latinamerica on this transaction.

       HAMBURG (dpa-AFX) - Dublin-based budget carrier Ryanair has paid damages to individual passengers 
whose flights did not reach their destinations on time due to strikes, a Hamburg court said Monday.  In at least five 
legal proceedings, Ryanair recognized the demands of the plaintiff, a Hamburg court spokesman said. 
 Ryanair declined to comment on the proceedings.  Ryanair has previously refused to compensate passengers 
whose flights were cancelled due to strikes by Ryanair staff.  Under EU legislation for flight cancellations, an airline 
should pay 250 euros (293 dollars) to each passenger, unless they are informed at least two weeks in advance or 
are offered alternative flights arriving at their destination the same day.  An airline can withhold compensation if it 
can show that the cancellation is 'caused by extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided even 
if all reasonable measures had been taken,' according to the rules.  Last year, Ryanair argued that no 
compensation is payable 'when the union is acting unreasonably and totally beyond the airline's control.'  Air travel 
legal service provider Flightright, which has submitted lawsuits on behalf of hundreds of clients, disagrees, saying 
the company has provoked strikes with years of low wages and could have avoided an escalation of the labour 
action.  Flightright legal expert Oskar de Felice said the airline's behaviour was tactical: Ryanair wants to prevent 
the Hamburg court from pushing the issue on to the European Court of Justice.   Copyright dpa

AIRLINES have hit out at proposals to charge passengers an extra 50p to pay for the cost of repatriating travellers 
who are left stranded following a carrier collapse.
The government's insolvency review, which was set up by the Department for Transport (DfT) following the collapse 
of Monarch in 2017, has suggested the UK set up a "flight protection scheme" to help pay for passengers to fly back 
to the UK if they are left stranded by an airline collapse.
Peter Bucks, who led the review, said a flight protection scheme would create a "level playing field for all 
UKoriginating passengers, providing reasonable assurance of repatriation protection whether or not they hold an 
Atol [Air Travel Organiser's Licence Certificate]".
Atol was first introduced in the 1970s, when the popularity of overseas holidays grew. The certificate protects 
around 20m holidaymakers each year who have booked package holidays.
Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents carriers such as British Airways, Easyjet and 
Ryanair, said: "Airlines face rising costs and this is not the time to make it more expensive to travel."

Berlin airports operator FBB has started planning for where airlines will be based in the German capital's new hub, 
ahead of its scheduled opening next year.
The airport in Brandenburg is set to open in October 2020, and the major airlines serving Berlin now know where 
their flight operations will be based, FBB said today.
EasyJet and Lufthansa will be in the main Terminal 1, and Eurowings in Terminal 2. Ryanair will use the Schonefeld 
facility – which will become the airport's Terminal 5. FBB will allocate space to some 80 other airlines in stages over 
the coming weeks.
"Preparations for operations at BER are entering a new phase. The airport, the airlines and other partners have all 
been individually busy with the start of airline operations, and now we are starting joint preparations together," 
states FBB chief executive Engelbert Lutke Daldrup.
A series of building missteps and planning permission issues have hampered construction of Berlin Brandenburg, 
and 8 May marked seven years since the airport's planned 2012 opening was called off with just weeks to go.
Berlin's Tegel airport, located close to the city centre, is to shut once the new hub is open, but there have been calls 
– including from Ryanair – for it to remain open in order to ensure sufficient capacity.

Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr said the carrier had made an offer for Thomas Cook's German airline 
business, sending shares in the UK tour company up more than 10 per cent.
Lufthansa had been seen as a likely bidder for the Thomas Cook business, which trades under the name Condor 
and was once owned by Lufthansa. Bids for the airline were due by yesterday.
Although the European Commission is likely to demand remedies to address competition concerns if Lufthansa 
agrees a purchase, Mr Spohr told the airline's annual shareholder meeting that it was the only possible purchaser 
that would not break up Condor. Lufthansa might also look to buy Thomas Cook's British and Scandinavian airlines.
Daniel Roeska, a Bernstein analyst, said Condor made Thomas Cook "the fourth-largest airline group [in Germany] 
behind Lufthansa, Ryanair and easyJet", so its acquisition "would give Lufthansa a chance to further consolidate its 
home market and strengthen its competitive positioning - if approved by the competition authorities".
Thomas Cook shares have fallen more than 80 per cent in the past 12 months as online competition and 
discounting by rivals triggered two profit warnings.
After a further slide in its shares and bonds last week, the group sought to reassure investors by disclosing that it 
was in talks with lenders to ensure it had a "liquidity buffer" to cope with the tougher winter trading period.

Thomas Cook did not disclose the names of other bidders. A source close to the company said there had been 
"more than one bid but less than 10".
Lufthansa first voiced an interest in buying Condor's long-haul operations in February.

Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr said the carrier had made an offer for Thomas Cook's German airline 
business, sending shares in the UK tour company up more than 10 per cent.
Lufthansa had been seen as a likely bidder for the business that trades as Condor and which it once owned. Bids

Lufthansa, which also owns the Swiss, Austrian and Eurowings carriers, expressed interest in Condor's long-haul 
operations in February. It has gained confidence that EU regulators will allow it to buy Condor's short-haul 
operations as long as it agrees to sell some routes, said one person familiar with the matter.
In the late 1990s, Condor was part of Lufthansa, which sold its final 25 per cent stake to Thomas Cook in 2009. The 
travel company's airline division posted strong growth in 2018, despite facing industry-wide disruption, with 20m 
passengers and £3.5bn sales, while underlying operating profits rose 37 per cent in the year to £129m.
A Lufthansa takeover of one or all of Thomas Cook's airlines would simplify the sale of the larger Thomas Cook 
business, because Brussels requires airlines based in the bloc to be owned by European investors.
Fosun International of China, Thomas Cook's largest shareholder with a 17 per cent stake, is said to be interested 
in bidding for the rest of the business, said a person close to the company.
Shares in Thomas Cook closed up 6 per cent in London yesterday afternoon. Additional reporting by Patricia

       COLOGNE (dpa-AFX) - Lufthansa (DLAKF, DLAKY) CEO Carsten Spohr Tuesday said the company 
expressed its interest in the take over of Condor holiday airline. Speaking at the General Meeting Spohr said the 
company has officially conveyed a non-binding offer to the British owner Thomas Cook, that can also be extended 
to the complete airlines of the Group. Thomas Cook Group, with air operations in the UK, Scandinavia, Germany, 
and Spain, has been troubled with financial concerns. They put up 105 aircraft for sale last February.   The first 
deadline for the expressions of interest is on Tuesday. Wizz mother Indigo, Ryanair, Easyjet, and British Airways 
parent IAG are reportedly interested in the buy.   Spohr is of the view that the acquisition of the long-haul route to 
tourist destinations from Frankfurt and Munich appears to be attractive.

CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: Sainsbury Results Cheer After M&A Woe
CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: Sainsbury Results Cheer After 
M&A Woe

 Earnings were in focus over the past week in the consumer services sector, with J Sainsbury posting some good 
figures following its failed merger with Asda the week prior and Whitbread issuing its first annual results since 
selling its Costa Coffee chain to Coca-Cola.
Grocer Sainsbury's on Wednesday reported a 42% drop in pretax profit for the 52 weeks to March 9, not helped by 
almost GBP400 million of extra charges related to the aborted Asda merger, pension costs, and an overhaul of its 
banking platform. 
Revenue was up, though, by 1.9%, and underlying pretax profit beat expectations. Sainsbury's returned 11 pence 
to shareholders, up 7.8% year-on-year and ahead of consensus. 
The announcement came a day after Kantar said the UK's grocery sector picked up some pace in the 12 weeks to 
April 21, boosted by Easter spending, with Sainsbury's reclaiming second place from Asda in terms of market 
share. 
Turning to non-food retail, clothing and homewares chain Next on Wednesday beat its own sales expectations 
thanks to warmer weather at the end of April.
Sales in the thirteen weeks April 27 climbed 4.5%, ahead of expectations of a 3.2% rise, though Next did warn not 
to expect similar performance in the rest of the year. 
Fashion and homeware retailer N Brown on Thursday sunk to an annual loss after a profit, due to almost GBP150 
million of exceptional charges, treble a year prior. 
Revenue was broadly flat, with the Jacamo-owner saying performance was "solid" in the 52 weeks to March 2. 
However, it cut its annual dividend 50%, to 7.1p.

Looking at the wider UK retail sphere, on Friday research firm BDO said good weather, the school holidays, and a 
late Easter failed to soothe the UK's suffering high streets.
High street retail sales fell 0.4% in April, BDO said, the third month of decline in 2019 already, while there has been 
next to no growth over the past 15 months. 
On Wednesday, shop price inflation was shown to have fallen to 0.4% in April from 0.9% in March by the BRC-
Nielsen Shop Price Index. The slowdown was caused by a more than doubling of the number of discounted 
products as retailers try to boost sales. 
There was also an initial public offering announced in the retail sector, with luxury retailer Watches of Switzerland 
announcing a plan to float in London.
The firm, which sells top watch brands such as Rolex, Tag Heuer, Omega, and Patek Philippe, did not provide 
many details, but did say it would offer both new shares and allow existing shareholders - primarily investment 
funds managed by an affiliate of Apollo Global Management - to sell theirs. 
On Thursday, budget airline Ryanair reported a 10% rise in April passenger numbers, including Austrian airline 
Lauda, reaching 13.0 million. 
On the same day, central and eastern Europe-focused peer Wizz Air posted 19% traffic growth, with passenger 
numbers reaching 3.3 million. 
Outside of the UK, German airline Lufthansa on Tuesday posted a significantly widened first quarter net loss, 
reaching EUR342 million from just EUR39 million a year prior. 
Lufthansa blamed the wider loss on a sharp rise in fuel costs and a deterioration in unit revenue in Europe. Overall 
revenue rose 3% to EUR7.89 billion. 
A week-long strike by SAS pilots ended on Thursday, though not before the Scandinavian airline had to cancel 
4,000 flights. 
The labour action was over concerns about scheduling, job security, and salaries, and affected around 380,000 
passengers. 
Moving into hospitality, Intercontinental Hotels Group on Friday reported subdued revenue per available room 
growth, rising 0.3% in the first quarter.
In the Americas, the figure rose 0.8%, with performance strong in the US, Mexico, and Colombia. 
Premier Inn-owner Whitbread on Tuesday posted a steep drop, 39%, in pretax profit for its year ended February 28, 
though it did rise 1.2% underlying. 
Whitbread booked GBP178 million in extra costs, much of which were due to its sale of Costa Coffee to Coca-Cola. 
Whitbread cut its annual dividend to 99.65p from 101.15p a year prior, and it also warned on weak revenue per 
room in the UK going forward. 
Moving to restaurants, brewer and pub owner Greene King on Tuesday guided for a rise in profit in its recently 
ended year, following solid sales growth.
Greene King said sales rose 2.9% ahead of the UK pub market for its year ended April 29, with trading over Easter 
strong. Profit before tax and exceptional items for the year to be in the range of GBP244 million and GBP247 
million, slightly ahead year-on-year.
On the same day, fast-food firm McDonald's said it had a strong start to 2019, despite a slight decline in net income 
and revenue.
