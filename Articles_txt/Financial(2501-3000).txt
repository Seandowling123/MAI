Professional investors are always on the lookout for stocks that can be scooped up at low valuations. In an industry 
recovering from pandemic lows, Ireland-based  shows signs of institutional buying with a one-month gain of 
11.17%. The stock attempts to fly above a year-to-date decline of 34.26%.  
The company operates as a discount European airline. It s based in Dublin and flies routes  in its home country, the 
U.K., the European continent and a few cities in North Africa.  
The stock has also posted an impressive one-week gain of 7.39%. Shares closed Thursday at $67.77, up $0.50, or 
0.74%. Trading volume was 14% higher than average. 
Forecasts for airline stocks show much clearer skies than in the past two years. Companies such as Germany s 
Lufthansa,  and provide strong outlooks for fourth-quarter travel.  
The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (yes, those folks who make you take your shoes off) said on 
October 17 that it screened 2.49 million air passengers the previous day. That was the highest level since February 
2020. 
The best price performer within the airline industry in is , which is up 32% so far in October. Panama-based is also 
a standout, with a gain of 11% this month.   
Ryanair CEO Michael O Leary told Reuters earlier this month that bookings at the airline for both the autumn and 
holiday travel season were tracking ahead of pre-COVID-19 levels, despite fare increases.  
He added that demand may be linked to increased pandemic savings rates. However, inflation and increased 
energy costs for northern European consumers may put a dent in consumers' willingness to travel. Revenue 
Growth Rebound  
Aaron Dessen, a certified financial planner at Payne Capital Management, tells MarketBeat that he s been eyeing 
Ryanair s strong revenue growth. Revenue increased between 68% and 837% in the past five quarters. Ryanair 
has forecasted an additional 97 million passengers in 2023.  
Dessen points out that Ryanair took the step of hedging fuel costs until early next year, which helps it withstand 
cost increases. It took a big risk by retaining most employees during pandemic slowdowns but it s reaping the 
benefits of full staffing while other airlines struggle to maintain full schedules with reduced workforces. 
Will Ryanair Stock Gains, Strong Estimates Help it Fly?
 It has saved them a lot of headaches and costs coming out of the pandemic because they re able take that 
increase in demand and traffic in stride,  Dessen says.  
It also prevents public relations nightmares that many U.S. airlines endured over the summer when passengers 
took to social media to complain about canceled flights. 
Analysts See Return to Profitability
This may surprise you: Within the airline industry, Ryanair has the third-largest market capitalization behind and 
Southwest. Ryanair s market cap is $15.28 billion, putting it at the lower end of the large-cap category.  
Analysts see the company rebounding to profitability for the full year, fiscal 2023. Wall Street expects net income of 
$6.42 per share. That would be up from losses in fiscal 2021 and 2022. Fiscal 2021, which included the bulk of 
pandemic slowdowns, saw a loss of $5.36 per share, its first in years. That narrowed to a loss of $0.75 per share in 
fiscal 2022. 
In fiscal 2024, analyts expect Ryanair to earn $6.17 per share, which would be down slightly from the current year 
but still higher than pre-pandemic levels.  
MarketBeat analyst data  for Ryanair show a  moderate buy  rating on the stock, with a price target of $104.50, a 
potential upside of 53.99%.  
Does that mean it s time to buy? Like many stocks right now, Ryanair s longer-term 200-day average is above its 
50-day. That s not uncommon. As the stock rallies, that situation will eventually reverse itself. It s understandable to 
want to get in on a stock early, especially when analysts see strong upside potential.  
However, with the broader market still burdened by uncertainty and the stock s own moving averages signaling 
continued weakness, you may consider waiting for a better rally to take hold.

British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG) has said it is buying dozens of 
new Boeing 737 Max short-haul aircraft.
Chief executive Luis Gallego said the aircraft will bring "long-term cost savings, lower carbon emissions as well as 
an improved customer experience".
Earlier this week it was confirmed that shareholders of British Airways and Iberia parent IAG approved the purchase 
of 50 of the Boeing aircraft.
The order includes several of the high-capacity Max 8200, which can carry up to 204 passengers, and the as yet 
uncertificated Max 10, which can theoretically carry up to 230.
Boeing also said it has an option to purchase a further hundred 737 Max aircraft.
Trade press said the high-density Max 8200 was designed with low-cost carriers in mind, with Ryanair already 
operating the largest Max fleet and using it for some of its most popular European routes.

Clear skies ahead for Lufthansa as carrier expects strong passenger demand to stay for next months

LUFTHANSA yesterday said it anticipated demand to remain strong in the months ahead, with capacity expected at 
80 per cent of pre-Covid levels in the fourth quarter despite inflationary pressures.
According to chief executive Carsten Spohr, people will continue to splash cash on tickets after two years of not 
being allowed to travel due to the Covid pandemic.
"After all, the desire to travel and thus the demand for air travel continues unabated," Spohr said on Thursday, as 
he unveiled the third quarter results.
The chief executive's remarks have been echoed by the likes of Ryanair's chief Michael O'Leary, who said people 
will not stop flying altogether.
Lufthansa's high premium demand from leisure travellers remained "remarkable" in the three months ended 30 
September, as the load factors for business and first class were up on pre-pandemic levels.
Yields - a metric of profitability - were on average up 23 per cent compared to 2019 levels, while the overall load 
factor was back at prepandemic record levels.
The group's revenue went up 93 per cent to (EURO)10.1bn (£8.7b) as Lufthansa's adjusted EBIT surged to 
(EURO)1.1bn."The Lufthansa Group has economically left the pandemic behind and is looking optimistically into the 
future," the chief executive added. The carrier made the headlines last week when it raised its full-year profit 
forecast to more than (EURO)1bn after previously expecting it to be around (EURO)500m.

minimum services set by the Transport Ministry made it unfeasible, according to the union.

 by Kieran McCarthy[1] 
When the Supreme Court decided Van Buren v. United States last summer, many Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 
experts[2] felt that the decision avoided the worst interpretations of the CFAA, while consciously leaving most of its 
practical applications for lower courts to decide later. Sixteen months later, we're starting to see those practical 
applications get decided. 
Unlike most CFAA cases, RyanAir DAC v. Booking Holdings[3], 2022 WL 13946243 (D. Del. Oct. 24, 2022), 
presents a fact-pattern that just about anyone can understand. Booking Holdings is the parent company for 
Kayak.com, Priceline, Booking.com, and other prominent online travel agents ('OTAs'). It is the largest OTA in the 
world. 
Ryanair is Europe's largest discount airline. Its business model is to sell highly discounted flights at, near, or below 
cost and then to make additional profits by selling ancillary services such as food, drinks, rental cars, hotels, and 
insurance on their site and on their flights. But much of this business model is contingent on being able to sell flights 
directly through Ryanair's site to control the market for ancillary services. 
Ryanair has a long history of litigating against OTAs in Europe and the United States. It has previously litigated 
against OTAs in Spain, France, Ireland, and Switzerland, with mixed results. It previously litigated against Expedia 
in Washington.[4] 
The facts of the case are relatively simple, with a couple of twists. Booking Holdings is the parent company of 
multiple OTAs that publish fare data and sell Ryanair flights in purported violation of Ryanair's terms of service. As 
usual in these types of cases, Ryanair sent cease-and-desist letters to Booking telling it to stop. Needless to say, it 
didn't stop. When Booking didn't stop, Ryanair sued for five different violations of the CFAA. 
One twist is that Ryanair cannot sue Booking in the United States for breach of its terms of service, because 
Ryanair's terms of service are governed by Irish law and require the jurisdiction of Irish courts. Because Ryanair 
cannot invoke its terms of service in the United States, it must resort to unique causes of action for which there is 
not a comparable remedy in Ireland. In this instance, the CFAA. 
The other twist is that Booking did not scrape or access Ryanair's data directly from Ryanair's site. Rather, it hired a 
few different third-party sites to collect the data and provide it to them. Booking was hoping this might forestall any 
Does the CFAA Help Airlines Control Their Distribution Channels?-RyanAir v. Booking (Guest Blog Post)
CFAA liability. According to Booking's briefing for this motion, the CFAA is fundamentally a computer access 
statute. Without access, there can be no violation of the CFAA. 
With that background, Booking filed a motion to dismiss the CFAA claims based on two primary arguments: 1) 
Booking is using publicly available data obtained from a third party to sell Ryanair flights. Based on the holdings of 
Van Buren and hiQ Labs II, this conduct does not trigger CFAA liability; 2) Even if this conduct were sufficient to 
trigger direct CFAA liability, the CFAA does not provide for vicarious liability. 
The District Court of Delaware mostly denied Booking's motion to dismiss. 
With respect to the 'publicly available data' argument, the court decided that these facts were more akin to the facts 
of Power Ventures than those of hiQ Labs. Power Ventures was a 2016 case involving Facebook (back when the 
company itself was still known as Facebook). Power Ventures was a platform that attempted to enable users to 
manage all their social media accounts from one platform. To do so, they had to take users' log-in credentials on 
the various platforms and collect users' data from those platforms to aggregate it within the Power Ventures 
platform. 
The key issue in that case was whether Facebook had the authority to invoke the CFAA against a third-party 
company (in that case, Power Ventures) that had allegedly violated Facebook's terms of use using the valid log-in 
credentials that it had consensually received from Facebook's users. The Ninth Circuit panel said that while users 
have the right to grant a third-party access to their Facebook accounts, that Facebook had a right to revoke access 
to those credentials at its discretion, even though the credentials were still valid for the users themselves and 
consensually given by the users to Power Ventures. 
I thought this was wrongly decided then, and I still think this is wrong now. The proper remedy for Facebook in this 
situation should be simple—if it doesn't like that a user has shared their credentials, terminate or suspend their 
account. But allowing a private company to invoke a criminal statute for violating its terms of use against a third 
party because of consensual password sharing gives private companies far too much power and is beyond the 
scope of the statute. 
The CFAA is an anti-hacking statute; password sharing isn't hacking. Indeed, this would seem to contradict the 
(needlessly opaque) instructions from the text of Van Buren itself, which said, '[a]n interpretation that stakes so 
much on a fine distinction controlled by the drafting practices of private parties is hard to sell as the most plausible 
[interpretation of the CFAA].' Van Buren at 20. 
That said, hiQ Labs I and hiQ Labs II both distinguished Power Ventures; those cases did not repudiate it. And so 
the Delaware court found it dispositive here. 
If you want to buy a ticket on Ryanair, you must create an account with a username and password. According to 
Power Ventures in the Ninth Circuit and now this case in Delaware, that step likely allows you to invoke the CFAA 
against a third party for violating your terms of service and for continuing to access a website after receiving a 
cease-and-desist letter—even though the exact same conduct in the absence of a username and password 'risks 
the possible creation of information monopolies that would disserve the public interest.' hiQ Labs II at 43. 
The court was also not persuaded by Booking's arguments that vicarious liability is unavailable under the CFAA, 
even though many cases seemed to suggest as much. For example, consider this language from Koninklijke Philips 
N.V. v. Elec-Tech International Co., Ltd.: 
Plaintiffs here make no allegation that either Mr. Wang or Ms. Chan was given Dr. Chen's password and then ran 
searches, nor do they allege that either individual Defendant in any way accessed or downloaded information from 
Lumileds' network. By the Complaint's own allegations, none of the CFAA Defendants accessed Lumileds' 
information-Dr. Chen did, at a time when he was authorized to download this information. Even if he 
misappropriated the information, and gave it to the CFAA Defendants, Nosal forecloses a claim against those 
Defendants under the CFAA because they themselves did not hack Lumileds' system. Plaintiffs' argument that Dr. 
Chen and the CFAA Defendants were essentially 'acting as one' for purposes of accessing the files does not save 
Plaintiffs' CFAA claim. Rather, it shows that this case is factually quite similar to Nosal: it is alleged that outsiders 
convinced an insider to access information the insider was authorized to access, then hand that information over to 
the outsiders. While such allegations could possibly state a claim for misappropriation, they cannot state a claim 
under the CFAA after Nosal. Reading the CFAA in its context as an anti-hacking statute, 'access' means something 
more than persuading someone to procure information you desire. Instead, as described by the district court in 
Nosal II, '[t]he common definition of the word 'access' encompasses not only the moment of entry, but also the 
ongoing use of a computer system.' Nosal II, 930 F.Supp.2d 1051, 1063 (N.D. Cal.2013). None of the CFAA 
Defendants entered or used Lumileds' network. At most, they encouraged Dr. Chen to do so, and stood to benefit 
Does the CFAA Help Airlines Control Their Distribution Channels?-RyanAir v. Booking (Guest Blog Post)
from the alleged misappropriation. This action may give rise to a number of claims, but it does not support a theory 
of liability under the CFAA. (emphasis mine) 
Koninklijke Philips N.V. v. Elec-Tech International Co., Ltd. 2015 WL 1289984 at 4 (N.D. Cal. March 20, 2015). 
It wasn't a total loss for Booking, though. It scored a minor victory when the judge granted its motion to dismiss with 
respect to RyanAir's Section 1030(a)(5) allegations, which prohibits 'knowingly caus[ing] the transmission of a 
program, information, code, or command, and as a result of such conduct, intentionally caus[ing] damage without 
authorization, to a protected computer.' 
For me, any CFAA decision that makes it illegal to aggregate price information that anyone can access online is a 
bad one. Price comparison services benefit everyone except for companies looking to obfuscate prices and 
eliminate competition. Every human being—including the executives of Booking Holdings—can go to Ryanair's web 
site today and look at how much it costs to fly from Dublin to Barcelona (or Girona, since Ryanair is too cheap to fly 
directly to Barcelona). According to Van Buren, '[CFAA] liability [] stems from a gates-up-or-down inquiry—one 
either can or cannot access a computer system, and one either can or cannot access certain areas within the 
system.' Ryanair permits anyone to view its price and flight data. Everyone can access the system—except those 
whose technology and services threaten their business model. 
I understand why Ryanair wants to control or redirect traffic to its site. Every for-profit company is in the business of 
making money. I just don't think that a federal anti-hacking statute should be the legal mechanism that allows them 
to do that. There are a panoply of state-law claims that have been litigated in similar cases with similar facts. And 
however that might play out in state or federal court would depend on the nuances of the relevant state, federal, 
and international legal precedents. But to make this a CFAA issue just seems wrong to me. 
This decision allows Ryanair to selectively invoke the CFAA against a company that harms its business model for 
the mere act of harming its business model. That's not what the statute is designed to prevent. But that is precisely 
what courts are allowing it to be used for.

European airlines showed pent-up demand in Q3
European airlines showed pent-up demand in Q3
Airguide Business & AirguideBusiness.com

Length: 1010 words
Body
European airlines' Q3 results could show that pent-up demand has a bit further to run after positive updates from 
full-service (IAG and Lufthansa) and discount (EasyJet and Ryanair) carriers. Yet management teams must show 
preparedness for mounting costs and the squeeze on consumer budgets, with our scenario analysis suggesting an 
abrupt hit to leisure demand in 2023.
The spot price of jet fuel has softened since June but is still up about 70% vs the 2019 average, so it remains a 
threat to profitability as more hedges expire. Network carriers rely heavily on corporate and transatlantic travel, 
potentially providing some protection against a strong dollar. Budget airlines continue to capture market share and 
increase competition within short haul.
Next year should drive more airline conversation
Current-year earnings expectations for Europe's three key legacy airlines - IAG, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa 
Group - have been resilient since Q2, yet the 2023 outlooks remain uncertain amid deteriorating macroeconomic 
factors. The expiration of fuel hedges and rising wages may be hard to fully offset with higher yields as leisure 
customers cut discretionary spending, so a recovery in corporate travel is key for profitability. Finnair and SAS are 
among the worst hit by Russian air space closures and need restructuring, while Turkish Airlines is benefiting from 
more passengers, lira-denominated costs and cargo.
IAG is overcoming capacity cuts using higher yields, with transatlantic operations ramping up and pent-up demand 
likely enabling conditions to deliver higher sales. While partially hedged this year, rising fuel prices on top of airport 
fees could mean further fare hikes and uncertainty to the more price-sensitive passenger segments, albeit with no 
weakness in bookings indicated yet for 4Q.
The extent of corporate travel returning on certain routes is key for margin as the seasonal dip in leisure travel 
approaches. Media reports suggest IAG is in talks to buy a remaining 80% stake in Spanish carrier Air Europa, 
which along with capital spending requirements would put further pressure on net debt. If no equity is raised, net 
debt could remain above that of legacy peers Air France-KLM and Lufthansa.
Discount airlines face volatility, rising rates
European airlines showed pent-up demand in Q3
The war in Ukraine, a resulting energy crisis, dollar strength and rising interest rates threaten to jeopardise 
European discount airlines' revenues and costs, with many unable to offset the effects with activity from outside the 
region. Ryanair's profit looks the most resilient, while Wizz Air's fiscal 2023 (ending March) margin expectations 
have cratered amid disruptions and limited hedging, particularly for jet fuel.
EasyJet's recent update suggests cancellation and delay costs are under better control, and initial bookings for the 
quarter ending December look respectable, yet it has significant exposure to the downturn in the UK economy. 
Norwegian Air is getting its downsized operations back to normal conditions under a new management team and 
strategy after facing financial difficulties during the pandemic.
Ryanair's utilisation and load factor through the important summer period points to much greater operating 
efficiency vs peers, driving profit higher, assuming good yield management and cost control. The airline has been 
cautious and refrained from guidance thus far, but the cited adverse news flow risks on Covid-19 or war haven't 
developed.
Bookings also appear strong for the autumn and Christmas holiday periods despite rising costs of living. The UK's 
political troubles have damaged confidence further, though Ryanair seeks to benefit from these customers trading 
down to budget carriers. Ryanair enjoys some natural hedging on the pound as the carrier employs a large number 
in bases such as Stansted to offset the revenue impact. The company has been negotiating post-Covid-19 pay 
improvements with unions.
Q2 was Wizz Air's busiest period, but expectations were already slashed due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, 
limited fuel hedging and disruption. Staff shortages and operational snags meant buffers had to be built in, which 
lowered capacity but eased costs. The carrier's fleet size is now about 40% larger vs this time in 2019, so utilisation 
appears even more key for profitability, and analysts may be looking for comments on forward demand after 
encouragement from EasyJet's trading statement.
The Middle East is part of the Hungarian carrier's eastward strategy, as it stretches its reach to new markets with 
limited low-cost competition. Wizz Air Abu Dhabi is ramping up, while in Saudi Arabia, Wizz's inbound flights 
commenced on 28th September; a national partner is needed for outbound.
EasyJet's capacity cuts helped bring disruption costs under control during fiscal 4Q (ending September), with 
stronger demand driving a jump to £470-490 million in headline pre-tax profit. Plus EasyJet Holidays is starting well, 
generating more than £35 million in fiscal 2022 pre-tax profit. Yet the budget airline faces different challenges after 
a busy summer period, albeit with passenger caps still in place at Amsterdam Schiphol. While UK seats are 
planned near pre-Covid-19 levels for the October and Christmas holidays, demand may be fragile in non-peak 
times as real incomes are squeezed.
EasyJet has reasonable cover as costs rise. Fuel is about 69% hedged for 1H23 at US$802 per metric ton, and 
44% for 2H23 at $897 vs a $1,100 spot price. There is also some cover on dollars, with these lease payments 
hedged for three years.

Highlight: Decision to close Doncaster Sheffield airport followed years of losses amid struggle to build critical mass
Body
New UK prime minister Liz Truss will need more than assurances that ­regional connectivity is vital to ­economic 
growth to avoid ­Doncaster Sheffield following Sheffield City airport into ­Yorkshire aviation obscurity.
Doncaster Sheffield’s financial performance hardly helps its case. It has never made a full-year operating profit 
since commercial operations began in April 2005.
While its near-2,900m (9,500ft) runway – more than twice the length of Sheffield City’s, which closed in 2008 – was 
considered an advantage for attracting airlines, Doncaster Sheffield struggled to build a critical mass of activity in 
the face of macro-economic hurdles.
Even as it opened, with operations from leisure company TUI, as well as Thomas Cook and Ryanair, the airport’s 
operator cautioned that commercial aviation was a “tough” market. The prevalence of low-cost services would mean 
aeronautical returns were “minimal”, it said, which meant relying on non-aeronautical revenues.
But it managed to attract long-haul interest – with holiday flights to destinations including Mexico, the Caribbean, 
and Florida – as well as budget carriers Wizz Air and Flybe. Passenger volume climbed steadily and peaked at 
more than 1 million in the 2007-2008 financial year, although the airport was heavily dependent on TUI, which 
accounted for 60% of passenger business.
Terminal capacity remained “considerably greater” than utilisation, the airport operator acknowledged in its 
statement for the year, and it attributed a persistent loss-making position to the “challenging market comprising our 
catchment area”.
Located in the north of England, Doncaster Sheffield was able to handle aircraft the size of Boeing 747s – a legacy 
of its beginnings as RAF Finningley – but scheduled cargo services proved elusive and freight activity was 
intermittent.
The global economic downturn in 2008-2009 caused substantial problems in both the passenger and freight 
sectors.
Don and dusted
Capacity reductions
TUI’s merger with holiday firm First Choice resulted in reductions in capacity, while Ryanair began rethinking routes 
as a consequence of Irish taxation.
Passenger numbers began to decline, and while the airport operator claimed carriers saw the benefits of Doncaster 
Sheffield, it said strategic decision-making in response to market forces – rather than lack of consumer demand – 
was affecting the level of activity.
With better access to the airport promised through a link road project, the operator sought to develop the airport as 
a major low-cost carrier base. EasyJet and Aer Lingus Regional established new operations but slow economic 
recovery and political instability in holiday markets caused passenger numbers to slide to fewer than 700,000 by 
2014.
Although passenger numbers started to rise again in 2015 – with a growth rate claimed as the fastest outside of 
London – the airport was hampered by high operating costs, and its financial performance was affected by 
impairments.
The airport restored passenger numbers to the 1 million mark during 2016-2017, after nearly a decade, and with the 
link road nearing completion and additional airline services emerging – including a Flybe base and scheduled 
freighter operations – the operator was optimistic, even as it cautioned about the “major challenge” to air transport 
arising from Brexit.
But as the airport recorded its highest annual passenger levels, 1.29 million, in March 2020, the onset of the 
coronavirus pandemic threatened to unravel the business. After Flybe had ceased operations, Wizz Air stepped in 
to set up its own base in October 2020, but when Wizz reconsidered its strategy and opted to close its Doncaster 
Sheffield base – leaving only TUI as a based company – the airport’s owner, Peel Group, lost patience.
Peel Group initiated a review of the airport’s business case, but could not identify proposals which could deal with 
its “fundamental lack of financial viability”, given the high fixed costs and slump in the air transport market. Absent 
of a rescue, the provision of aviation services at Doncaster Sheffield began winding down from the end of October.

With the transitional licensing window for ­
EASA-validated personnel working in the UK expiring at year-end, the clock is running down
to secure new post-Brexit approvals
When the UK opted to leave the EU, the complex process of ‘Brexit’ disentanglement included controversially 
unhitching its aviation regulatory functions from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and re-
establishing the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as a separate oversight organisation.
Under the trade agreement negotiated between the UK and EU, UK-licensed pilots and engineers ceased to be 
qualified on EU-registered aircraft on 1 January 2021, immediately after the UK’s full EU withdrawal.
Some airlines – among them EasyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air – operating in both the UK and EU opted to split their 
fleets, establishing either UK- or EU-based operations under local registries in order to maintain flexibility and retain 
traffic rights.
Regulatory approval
Regulatory approval of personnel was initially one-sided. All the EASA licences and certificates for operations and 
maintenance that were valid at the end of 2020 have remained recognised by the CAA for a two-year period.
This temporary recognition window was put in place in order to “maximise stability” for the ­aviation sector, says the 
CAA, and avoid operational ­disruption for passengers.
No Headline In Original
If there were hopes that the UK-EU trade ­agreement would be broadened within a short time to encompass areas 
such as aircraft maintenance, they appear to have been without foundation. The CAA says there are “no signs” of 
such expansion.
As a result, the licensing recognition will expire not only for EASA-approved pilots, instructors and ­examiners on 
UK-registered aircraft, but also engineers, maintenance companies, and continuing airworthiness organisations.
The window is set to close at the end of 2022, and last year – about halfway through the grace period – the CAA 
embarked on an effort to raise awareness of the approaching deadline.
Licences issued by the UK during its time as an EASA member are still UK licences, and will remain valid after the 
deadline. But EASA licences issued by other EU countries will not, and EASA authorisation will no longer be 
accepted for working, operating and training in the UK.
The CAA had already initiated a simplified ­application process for EASA-licensed personnel to obtain a UK licence, 
and enable those who had ­previously held UK licences to regain them.
This streamlined procedure is not being extended once the deadline expires, however, and the CAA is now warning 
that EU-licensed pilots will ­subsequently be required to undertake “the full conversion process, including 
examinations” in order to be qualified in the UK.
CAA flight operations manager Barry ­Mooney, speaking in May, referred to a ­“massive bow wave” of applicants 
who were seeking to secure ­continuity of licence approvals in the last two or three months of 2020, as pilots 
realised that the UK was withdrawing from EASA.
Some 8,000 personnel ultimately transferred out of the UK system as EASA membership ended. Those who initially 
opted to transfer but subsequently ­cancelled remain UK licence holders. Mooney expresses concern that a similar 
­situation will develop this year as the recognition window begins to shut.
“We do have suspicion of human nature that people will be optimistic and leave things to the very last minute in the 
expectation that things will change,” he says. “The deadline will not change.”
Organisational awareness
Larger entities, with which the authorities have ­routine contact, are likely to be organised in time and the CAA 
believes awareness within airlines is strong. Difficulties emerge at the lower end of the scale, with individual pilot or 
engineering approvals.
The CAA says it will aim to process all applications which were submitted in a “reasonable time” before the end of 
this year, but it is not guaranteeing that late submissions – anything after 1 September – will result in a UK licence 
being issued by 1 January next year.
Among the complications with dealing with the influx of applications to obtain a UK licence is the need for the CAA 
to verify information contained on EASA licences issued by the respective national authority, which introduces 
uncertainty into the timescale – particularly if the authority concerned does not have sufficient resources.
“A key area is making sure individual pilot licence holders who left the UK system ahead of EU exit are aware that 
regaining a UK licence after the end of this year will be more complex,” says the CAA. “We have been contacting 
pilots directly to make them aware of this. We have also offered a phased payment option to make it easier to 
apply. The decision of whether to regain a UK licence is a personal choice by each pilot, so it is impossible to say 
how many will apply.”
Although the CAA has not given its latest figures, it indicated during a May briefing, hosted by law firm Bird & Bird, 
that it had issued up to 2,500 licences with another 1,000 being processed – most of which were for professional 
pilots.
No Headline In Original
The CAA believes that the UK licence is a ­“marketable” commodity and it stresses that pilots who hold EASA 
licences can also simultaneously hold a UK licence.
“There is no need to surrender your EASA ­privileges in order to obtain your UK licence, regardless of whether a 
licence has been held with the UK CAA previously,” it states. Personnel also will receive full credit on their UK 
licence, which will enable access to employment. The CAA adds that there is no need to demonstrate currency or 
recency on the EASA licence prior to conversion, although a UK medical certificate is required.
It adds that the level of confidence in the UK training market is high, as demonstrated by the number of training 
organisations outside of the UK which are looking to gain – or have already obtained – UK approval, in order to 
support pilots in the country. This is further illustrated by a surge in the number of simulators and training devices 
available.
Further burdening the withdrawal from the EU and EASA has been the need to re-authorise airlines that have been 
operating to the UK from third countries.
Under EASA membership, third-country carriers ­flying to the UK needed a Part-TCO authorisation, which involved 
an assessment and evaluation of ­technical and safety information.
EASA would validate the foreign air ­operator’s ­certificate and issue approval to the third­­country carrier, which 
would then remain ­subject to ­continuous monitoring.
Time limited
But as with the EASA-issued personnel licences, the UK CAA only recognised the Part-TCO approval for a ­two­
year period.
Third-country operators have needed to apply to the CAA in order to continue operating to the UK beyond 2022.
While this process should be “straightforward”, in theory, the CAA insists the exercise is “not just a rubber stamp” 
for carriers that had previously been approved under the EASA scheme – pointing out that UK regulators need to 
conduct their own record-gathering and decision-making.
This has meant implementing a priority system, with scheduled airlines, medical transport operators, and air taxi 
providers all having to be contacted in order. The CAA has been aiming to contact organisations that have operated 
to the UK over the past three years, but others will need to be more proactive. w

THE WORLD's surge in inflation rates will help Ryanair's growth as people will not stop flying altogether, but will 
rely instead on budget airlines.
"We think recession [and] price inflation is very good for our growth," chief executive Michael O'Leary told 
journalists in Lisbon yesterday.
European countries have been hit by soaring inflation rates as a result of the war in Ukraine's impact on energy 
prices as well as a tight labour market.
Germany's consumer prices reached 10.9 per cent in September, the highest in more than 25 years, while the UK 
saw an increase to 10.1 per cent this month.
"In a recession people become more price sensitive," O'Leary, who is set to stay at Ryanair's helm until 2028, said. 
"They shop in Lidl and Aldi, they spend more on furniture in Ikea and when they want to fly, they fly with Ryanair."
The low-cost carrier reported that 15.9m passengers flew aboard its planes in September - the second-busiest 
month ever after August's 16.9m trav- ellers. Numbers are not expected to subside, as in early October Ryanair 
said it was expecting an increase in air fares "by a mid to high single digit figure for the full year" following 
"surprisingly strong" bookings.
The chief exec hailed Rishi Sunak's appointment as Prime Minister. He told Reuters he was glad the Brexiteer wing 
of the government was out and that "adults have taken charge again".
O'Leary: Global inflation good for our growth
"They are getting rid of some of the people who were there, from Boris Johnson to Liz Truss, all the Brexiteer wing 
of the Tory party - they are crazy," the chief executive said.
O'Leary called on the newly-appointed PM to agree to a trade deal with the EU.
"Brexit is done but at least have the best free trade deal you can have," he said. "Europe is still the UK's largest 
trading partner."
The airline stopped trading on the London Stock Exchange in December last year following concerns over 
admission fees and post-Brexit ownership rules.

 https://www.legalfutures.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Dan-Fox.jpg Fox: Important to get boots on the ground in the 
UK and US 
The biggest alternative legal services provider (ALSP) in Ireland is heading to London and the US next year after 
closing a €10.5m (9.1m) funding round. 
Dan Fox, chief executive of Johnson Hana, said staff numbers at the firm could double by the end of next year from 
240, including 200 lawyers, to almost 500. 
The funding round was led by AIB plc and backed by 'a host of angel investors'. 
Johnson Hana, founded by Mr Fox and his brother Alex in 2017, provides its clients, many of whom are multi-
national companies, with two main services - legal process outsourcing and contract lawyers. 
Mr Fox said most of Johnson Hana's lawyers worked on a part-time basis, often for around 20 hours a week. 
'We want to inject some flexibility into the lives of the lawyers, which we believe have been prejudiced for too long.' 
He said Johnson Hana had successfully 'developed momentum' with multi-nationals and 'grown with them'. The firm 
works for Ryanair, Airbnb, LinkedIn, Twitter and others. Around 5% of its work is for law firms, such as Linklaters. 
Mr Fox said he had 'grand ambitions' for Johnson Hana. 'We believe we could become the world's best ALSP. 
Nobody has really quite identified yet the true potential scale of legal work that is process rather than legal advice.' 
He said it was important to get 'boots on the ground' in the UK and US next year, and by the summer new offices 
should be in place in London and San Francisco. This would bring the staff total by the end of 2023 to somewhere 
around 500. 
Mr Fox said Johnson Hana was also looking to 'double down' on the growth in the Republic of Ireland, which he 
described as 'probably the most antiquated market that there is'. 
He went on: 'There must be a better way. Legal work and process must be carved up so that businesses can pay 
for value. There has been an absence of management and technology tools here, to ensure the right lawyer is 
undertaking the right task.' 
However, government agencies and the Irish government had led the way with outsourcing. 
Another advantage of Ireland lay in the multi-nationals that had relocated since Brexit, along with the talent pool of 
'English-speaking, highly educated lawyers, who want to work in more flexible ways'. 
Ireland 's biggest ALSP heads to London after 9m funding boost
In a separate development, Manchester-based contract management specialist Summize has secured 5m funding 
to expand into the US. 
The funding was raised through YFM Equity Partners' British smaller companies venture capital trusts (VCTs) and 
the Maven VCTs. 
Tom Dunlop, co-founder and CEO at Summize, said the company, launched in 2018, helped clients secure greater 
value from business contracts by speeding up and automating processes, from creating a contract through to 
analytics and summaries. 
'Unlike many of our competitors, our system integrates directly with existing collaboration tools, which is vital for 
adoption across the business.' 
Mr Dunlop, a solicitor and former in-house lawyer, said: 'The Series A funding will enable us to build out our sales 
and marketing capabilities and accelerate expansion with a presence in the US, which is a huge potential market for 
us.' 
Summize said it had more than 100 businesses on its platform, including Fujifilm, Everton FC, Moonpig and The 
Modern Milkman. 
Speaking to Legal Futures[1] in the summer, Mr Dunlop predicted that embracing change and innovation would 
separate winners from losers among law firms.

German airline Lufthansa has reduced its domestic flight schedule to cut costs, which include high fees at the 
country's airports, chief executive Carsten Spohr has said.
Due to the high fees at German airports, Lufthansa is increasingly using its aircraft "more efficiently and profitably 
on other European routes," Spohr told dpa.
The carrier had also expanded cooperation with German railway operator Deutsche Bahn, the chief executive said.
Lufthansa and Deutsche Bahn have been offering a so-called Rail&Fly deal for years, with airline tickets for 
international flights including a train ride to a domestic airport.
Germany's domestic aviation sector has still not recovered from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which 
brought numerous travel restrictions, according to data compiled by the German Airports Association (ADV).
In September, some 1.9 million passengers were recorded on domestic flights, which accounts for only 45.3% of 
the pre-pandemic levels recorded in September of 2019.
In comparison, passenger levels on European flights have already returned to 80.2% compared to pre-pandemic 
levels, according to the ADV.
At the same time, domestic tickets were around 25% more expensive in August than three years earlier, according 
to Germany's Federal Statistical Office.
Lufthansa's domestic flights are mainly operated by the carrier itself as well as its subsidiary Eurowings, with 
competitors from abroad like low-cost airlines Easyjet and Ryanair having mostly withdrawn from the market.

Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air is drawing up plans for flights from the UK to the Middle East and Asia as part of 
an ambitious expansion into the long-haul market.
The carrier, which focuses on the European short-haul market, is planning trips out of the UK to destinations that 
could include the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Saudi Arabia. It will use some of the 47 new longer-range single-
aisle A321XLR planes it has on order from Airbus on the routes, said Marion Geoffroy, the managing director of 
Wizz Air UK.
The narrow-body jet took its first flight in June and is expected to enter service in 2024, according to Airbus.
"Of course, the UK would be a good market [for the XLR], and we've actually started the design of the potential 
network for XLRs and secured some designations to countries where we currently don't fly to," she said.
The airline, founded in 2004 and listed in London in 2015, has grown to become a big competitor to Ryanair in 
Europe's low-cost market.
However, it has suffered a difficult year and been badly exposed to the sudden rise in the price of jet fuel after 
abandoning fuel hedging during the pandemic. Its shares, which hit record highs last year, have fallen nearly 70 per 
cent this year, as investors bet on Ryanair dominating the European low-cost market. But Wizz's problems have not 
curbed its ambitions beyond Europe and come as it pursues a strategy of growth in the Middle East, where it has a 
joint venture in Abu Dhabi.
Wizz looks at Mideast and Asia routes Airlines
It has ruled out trying to crack the "overcompetitive" transatlantic market. There are also no plans to build long-haul 
networks used by traditional full-service airlines such as Emirates or Qatar Airways, Geoffroy said.
The A321XLR has a range of 4,700 nautical miles and can fly for up to 11 hours, opening up routes traditionally 
served by wide-body planes to airlines that give priority to fuel efficiency and cheaper tickets. Wizz plans to put 
more than 200 passengers on to the planes in the type of all-economy configuration typically used on shorter trips.
It is confident passengers will sacrifice comfort and in-flight entertainment for cheaper tickets. "The lowest cost will 
be always more attractive than getting hot chicken or movies that you have seen already," Geoffroy said.

 Ruja Ignatova, founder of the notorious crypto pyramid Onecoin, was reportedly alerted about police investigations 
into the scam before she disappeared. The 'Cryptoqueen' has been on the run for several years, wanted by law 
enforcement agencies around the world. 
Onecoin Mastermind Learned About Arrest Efforts From Leaked Police Documents, Podcast Reveals 
A media report has shed light on how Onecoin's founder Ruja Ignatova may have been warned about the plans to 
detain her months before she disappeared almost five years ago. That's according to files seen by the BBC, which 
airs a podcast devoted to the story of the infamous fugitive called 'The Missing Cryptoqueen.' 
The documents were shown by Frank Schneider, a former intelligence officer from Luxembourg and once trusted 
adviser to Ignatova who is facing extradition to the U.S. for his alleged role in the Ponzi scheme. Schneider denies 
obtaining the files himself and claims he received them on a flash drive from Ruja while the metadata suggests she 
got them through her own contacts in Bulgaria. 
The 42-year-old Bulgarian-born Ignatova, also a German national, is wanted by Interpol, Europol[1], and the FBI[2] 
for misappropriating $4 billion from defrauded investors. She was last seen on Oct. 25, 2017, when she boarded a 
Ryanair flight bound for Athens. Media reports unveiled[3] this summer that the Greek police tried to locate her, 
acting on information about her recent meetings in the country. 
According to the BBC, the police files contain presentations made during a meeting on 'Operation Satellite' at 
Europol's headquarters in The Hague held on March 15, 2017. It was attended by representatives of the FBI, the 
U.S. Department of Justice, and the New York District Attorney. Officers from the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, 
Dubai, and Bulgaria were also present. 
The participants discussed details of the investigation into the crypto pyramid, including unsuccessful attempts by 
the City of London Police to interview Ignatova. The FBI did not comment on the Europol documents but Special 
Agent Paul Roberts told the podcast: 
There were investigations all around the world into her, and into Onecoin generally, many of which she had become 
aware of due to actions by law enforcement in other countries. 
Cryptoqueen Ruja Ignatova Tipped Off About Onecoin Investigations Before She Vanished, Report
In 2019, U.S. prosecutors alleged that Schneider was the one who provided the Cryptoqueen with confidential 
police information. However, he insists that 'when the Bulgarians participated at certain Europol meetings, it only 
took hours for her to get a complete rundown and get the minutes of what was said in those meetings.' 
The Bulgarian Ministry of Interior, U.S. law enforcement bodies that took part in the March 2017 meeting, and the 
Dubai Police refrained from commenting. Europol, which said it's looking into the matter, stated that 'This complex 
scenario with many stakeholders makes it difficult to assess where and how such an incident might have occurred.'

arrest? Share your thoughts on the subject in the comments section below.

A strike over pay and work conditions by employees of the Italian air traffic control company Enav led to hundreds 
of flights to and from Italy being cancelled on Friday.
Italy's state-owned ITA Airways cancelled just over 200 flights, most of them domestic. Other airlines, like low-cost 
carriers easyJet and Eurowings, have also scrubbed flights from their schedules.
Ryanair alone said more than 600 flights were cancelled and about 110,000 passengers affected.
Air traffic control unions CGIL, CISL and UIL had called for the work stoppage, which was expected to affect Rome, 
Milan Malpensa and Venice airports the hardest.
The strike was known by airlines and passengers well in advance, resulting in few long queues or crowded airport 
halls. Compared to the usual volume of passengers on a Friday, Terminal 1 at Rome's Fiumicino was "half empty," 
according to the ANSA news agency.
"We apologize to all passengers who may be inconvenienced because of the strike," UIL wrote in a statement. It 
said Enav's stance toward workers' demands made the labour action unavoidable.
The unions demand changes in working hours and schedules from the partly state-owned Enav. The unions said 
they would press ahead with their demands - if necessary - with further protest actions.
The last strike at Enav was on July 17. At that time, too, numerous flights were cancelled in the middle of the 
summer vacation season, leaving passengers stranded at airports.

AND THAT'S THE TEA Lipton Ice Tea got a slap on the wrist from the watchdog in January this year over its bottle 
recycling claims. The ASA upheld a complaint on a poster for the tea brand, which read: "Deliciously refreshing, 
100 per cent recycled". This is despite the fact that small text at the bottom of the posted had extra detail which 
said: "Bottle made from recycled plastic, excludes cap and label". Lipton owner Pepsi Lipton accepted text was 
small and could have been overlooked.
OATLY TOLD NOT TO MILK IT Complaints against Oatly's TV ads were upheld this year after viewers questioned 
the claim that dairy and meat industries emit more CO2e than "all the world's planes, trains, cars, boats etc... 
combined". The dairy alternative brand was forced to ban the ads in the current form and was told by the ASA to 
"ensure that the basis of any environmental claim was made clear".
A GREEN COME FLY WITH ME? The budget airline Ryanair had an ad banned in 2020 after it called itself 
Europe's "lowest emissions airline". The ad watchdog said this was "misleading" because the nature of airline travel 
was inherently high emission. Ryanair said that it had based these claims on Eurocontrol data and airline efficiency 
rankings by Brighter Plant. The ASA said these claims had little evidence.
NOT SO KIND TO PLANET Persil's 'Kinder to our planet' TV ads were banned in August, with the watchdog stating 
that this claim was unsubstantiated and therefore misleading to customers. Parent firm Unilever said it should count 
as "kinder" because the detergent offered faster washes at lower temperatures. ASA was unconvinced and banned 
the ad in the context of the entire reel, which included kids clearing up litter and wider environment initiatives.

I f you have started thinking about a post-Christmas, Hanukkah or New Year holiday, you are not alone. Close to 
one in five travellers are already looking at booking breaks more than three months ahead, according to travel 
search engine www.Skyscanner.No matter where you live, though, it will cost you.
Airfares are soaring from New Zealand and Brazil to Europe and India. US inflation data published last week 
showed that average airfares there had risen 43 per cent over the past year.
Large parts of the world were still in Covid lockdown last year and a desperate airline industry might even have 
been prepared to give away seats if it could. So perhaps a 43 per cent rise is not that surprising.
But it is significant that average fares in the US for September have not been this high since 2014.
Yet people are still flying. In recent weeks operators such as Delta, United, Ryanair, easyJet and IAG have testified 
to the strength of people's appetite for travel, now and for the next few months.
"Demand has not come close to being quenched," said Delta's chief executive Ed Bastian last week as he 
upgraded profit expectations for the fourth quarter.
Airlines argue that high fares reflect the higher costs of operation after a surge in fuel prices, the rise of the dollar, 
and higher wage settlements with pilots, crew and other staff.
Passenger patience with sharply higher airfares is not unlimited INSIDE BUSINESS AIRLINES
The staff shortages in particular have encouraged most of the legacy airlines to take a cautious approach to 
rebuilding capacity. Anyone who remembers the chaos of last summer will understand their wariness about 
scheduling flights that may not get off the ground.
But there may also be a temptation to keep a cap on capacity to cash in after two years of pandemic losses. Just 
look at the bumper quarterly profits being announced by the likes of IAG, Lufthansa and others, which freely admit 
that higher fares are a factor.
Even the industry's arch fare-cutter, Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, has said that ticket prices will have 
to go up for several more years, and faster than even he expected just a few months ago.
It is difficult the pull will out on trips is a whopping or mortgage
But, at some stage, passenger patience with record ticket prices will surely run out. Historical data from Ascend by 
Cirium, the aviation analytics company, suggest there is "an inverse link between demand and fare change", 
according to Cirium executive Rob Morris.
The relationship was most clear in the last expansion cycle, he says, when fastgrowing budget carriers were able to 
significantly reduce the cost of travel and stimulate demand above the long-term growth trajectory.
This time round, the trend is moving in the opposite direction. Limited capacity is keeping airfares high, and the 
question is whether or when that affects demand. While demand is better than the industry had expected at this 
stage after the pandemic years, it is fragile and not yet exceptional compared with pre-Covid patterns.
According to data from ForwardKeys, the travel data provider, tickets issued for flights in Europe in the fourth 
quarter had recovered to 76 per cent of 2019 levels in the week to October 12, while airline capacity was running 
higher at 88 per cent. In the US, where demand seems more buoyant, there were still fewer passengers passing 
through airport security in October than in 2019.
Nevertheless, there are indications that passenger behaviour is normalising. Fewer travellers are leaving bookings 
to the last minute, say both Skyscanner and ForwardKeys. But if passenger behaviour is returning to normal, then 
tolerance of high fares could be expected to wear thin as people increasingly feel the effects of surging inflation and 
a darkening global economy.
It is normal for travellers to want to see family and friends over the festive period after a two-year absence. They 
may even shrug off the cost for the sake of spending time with loved ones again.
But, once the season is over, the economic clouds will be that much darker. It is difficult to see what the pull will be 
to splash out on costly airfares when there is a whopping heating bill or mortgage to pay.
Airlines may be thrilled with a better than expected autumn and the bounty that comes with it. But it would be 
premature to declare a definitive victory over the sector's bout of Covid until passengers start making their travel 
decisions in the depths of what promises to be a long, hard winter.

I f you have started thinking about a post-Christmas, Hanukkah or New Year holiday, you are not alone. Close to 
one in five travellers are already looking at booking breaks more than three months ahead, according to travel 
search engine www.Skyscanner.No matter where you live, though, it will cost you.
Airfares are soaring from New Zealand and Brazil to Europe and India. US inflation data published last week 
showed that average airfares there had risen 43 per cent over the past year.
Large parts of the world were still in Covid lockdown last year and a desperate airline industry might even have 
been prepared to give away seats if it could. So perhaps a 43 per cent rise is not that surprising.
But it is significant that average fares in the US for September have not been this high since 2014.
Yet people are still flying. In recent weeks operators such as Delta, United, Ryanair, easyJet and IAG have testified 
to the strength of people's appetite for travel, now and for the next few months.
"Demand has not come close to being quenched," said Delta's chief executive Ed Bastian last week as he 
upgraded profit expectations for the fourth quarter.
Airlines argue that high fares reflect the higher costs of operation after a surge in fuel prices, the rise of the dollar, 
and higher wage settlements with pilots, crew and other staff.
Passenger patience with sharply higher airfares is not unlimited INSIDE BUSINESS AIRLINES
The staff shortages in particular have encouraged most of the legacy airlines to take a cautious approach to 
rebuilding capacity. Anyone who remembers the chaos of last summer will understand their wariness about 
scheduling flights that may not get off the ground.
But there may also be a temptation to keep a cap on capacity to cash in after two years of pandemic losses. Just 
look at the bumper quarterly profits being announced by the likes of IAG, Lufthansa and others, which freely admit 
that higher fares are a factor.

Oct 20, 2022( Crypto Breaking News: https://cryptobreaking.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Three people are facing trial in Germany for their roles in one of the crypto world's most infamous scams, Onecoin. 
The defendants are accused of fraud, among other crimes, allegedly committed as they assisted the pyramid 
scheme's mastermind, 'Cryptoqueen' Ruja Ignatova, who is still on the run.  
Lawyer and Couple Face Criminal Allegations in Germany Over Roles in Onecoin Scam 
A husband and wife as well as an attorney from Munich are now among the first people in Europe to face criminal 
charges over their participation in the Onecoin crypto scam. On Tuesday, they appeared in a German court, 
Bloomberg reported. 
The three have been accused of money laundering, fraud, and banking crimes linked to the multibillion-dollar fraud 
scheme. The pyramid was founded and managed by Bulgarian-born German national Ruja Ignatova, dubbed the 
'Cryptoqueen.' 
The lawyer allegedly transferred €20 million ($19.7 million) to the Cayman Islands on behalf of Ignatova for the 
purchase of two London apartments for €75 million euros. The couple are charged with handling €320 million in 
payments from Onecoin customers within a year. 
The German indictment points out that the pyramid defrauded people by falsely claiming that Onecoin was a 
cryptocurrency with market-determined value. Investors were also told that it could be mined at a rate of 50,000 
coins per minute. In the court room, prosecutors explained: 
In reality, the ever-growing value was a fake and the mining process was only simulated by the software. 
Cryptoqueen Ruja Still Missing, Wanted by Europe and America 
Onecoin was established in 2014 and had an office in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, which was raided[1] by law 
enforcement after Ruja Ignatova's disappearance. The Cryptoqueen was last seen boarding a Ryanair flight bound 
for Athens on Oct. 25, 2017. 
Ignatova is now wanted by Interpol, Europol[2], and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI[3]) for 
misappropriating at least $4 billion from Onecoin clients. In July, Greek media revealed[4] that the Hellenic Police 
had unsuccessfully tried to locate and arrest her this year, acting on information that she met with specific persons. 
After Ignatova vanished from the public eye in late 2017, her brother Konstantin Ignatov took over, but he was later 
arrested in Los Angeles in 2019. Konstantin pleaded guilty and sought witness protection. In the U.S., Ignatova has 
been charged with wire and securities fraud as well as money laundering. 
Onecoin Cryptoqueen Associates Appear in German Court
In August, news came out that a British national accused of money laundering and wire fraud related to the Onecoin 
scam, Christopher Hamilton, had lost his bid to avoid extradition to the United States and would be handed over to 
U.S. authorities. 
At some point, the crypto pyramid claimed to have more than 3 million members around the world, generating some 
€3.4 billion euros in revenue in less than two years of operation as a multilevel marketing network, between late 
2014 and the third quarter of 2016. 
Do you expect more people to face charges in connection with the Onecoin crypto pyramid scheme? Share your

British Airways ramps up Belfast City flights

British Airways (BA, London Heathrow) will increase flights between Heathrow and Belfast City after Aer Lingus (EI, 
Dublin Int'l) confirmed it would cease operating on the route at the end of October. The Aer Lingus decision is 
attributed to Brexit complexities, including the imminent expiration of the airline's air operator's certificate (AOC) that 
granted it permission to fly UK domestic routes.
Currently, Aer Lingus operates up to five roundtrip A320 flights a day on the sector. Since the UK left the EU in 
early 2020, Aer Lingus has operated the route under temporary wet lease provisions. Under the new UK-EU Trade 
and Cooperation Agreement, EU airlines (Aer Lingus is based in Dublin) must apply for a UK AOC and register 
aircraft in the UK to operate UK-domestic flights - a stipulation Ryanair Holdings and Wizz Air Holdings have 
adapted to by establishing Ryanair UK and Wizz Air UK respectively.
"After the UK left the European Union, all UK-based airlines have to operate under a UK operating licence which 
governs the traffic rights they may hold. Under current legislation and international agreement, EU carriers such as 
Aer Lingus, are not permitted to operate scheduled services on UK domestic routes," a UK Civil Aviation Authority 
(CAA) spokesperson said.
"We've been flexible with Aer Lingus to find a sustainable solution which satisfies both the requirements of the UK-
EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement that no longer relies on the wet-leasing arrangements."
Across November, British Airways' schedules show it will operate between three and four roundtrip services a day 
on the route using various narrowbody Airbus aircraft. In the week starting October 24, ch-aviation capacities data 
reveals 18,040 seats are available on the sector, with 8,548 (47.38%) offered by Aer Lingus, 7,308 (40.51%) 
offered by British Airways, and 2,184 seats (12.11%) provided by flybe. (BE, Birmingham Int'l).
Despite making no overt moves to obtain the required AOC to resume UK domestic flights, Aer Lingus says it is 
keen to return to the route. "We are engaging with the relevant authorities in order to allow us to continue to service 
this route into the future," a spokesperson said.

Eurowings Europe (Malta) (E6, Malta Int'l) obtained its Air Operator's Certificate and Operating Licence from 
Transport Malta on October 13, 2022, and is due to start absorbing aircraft from Eurowings Europe (Austria) (E2, 
Vienna).
"Our move to Malta will be a success and help us to reduce the complexity for our employees at the various bases 
in Europe. In addition, the economic and regulatory environment in Malta will enable us to enter new markets as an 
attractive value airline and to thrive in our highly competitive environment. Above all, this means new perspectives 
for the entire Eurowings Europe team," Managing Director Stefan Beveridge said.
The ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows that Eurowings Europe currently operates seven A319-100s and 
thirteen A320-200s, and plans to transfer all of them from the German and Austrian registers to the Maltese one by 
the end of April 2023. The aircraft will remain based at their current airports and will continue operating exclusively 
under the code of parent company Eurowings (EW, Düsseldorf). The first aircraft to be registered in Malta will be 
A320-200 D-ABPD (msn 3093), which will become 9H-EUL.
The Maltese unit will be managed by a local team from Malta. However, employees of Eurowings Europe (Austria) 
will remain stationed at the same bases as their contracts are moved to the new entity. Eurowings Europe (Malta)'s 
first flight is scheduled for November 3, 2022.
Eurowings has thus joined other European low-cost carriers to establish a unit in Malta, including Ryanair Holdings 
(with Malta Air (MAY, Malta Int'l) and Lauda Europe (LW, Malta Int'l)) and Wizz Air Holdings (with Wizz Air Malta 
(WMT, Malta Int'l)).

Mosi-oa-Tuny - "the smoke that thunders" - is what the locals call the spectacular Victoria Falls in the border region 
of Zimbabwe and Zambia, said to be the widest continuous waterfalls in the world.
A visit can easily be combined with a safari excursion as the Zambezi river is also the natural habitat of many wild 
animals and a paradise for bird-watchers.
This week in the travel and events section from the dpa trends and features desk, we're giving you some highlights 
of Zimbabwe, plus an Italian museum deciding to make its biggest attraction share the spotlight.

Ryanair is drastically cutting its schedule at Berlin airport (BER) for winter 2022, criticizing increased airport charges 
in the German capital.
The low-cost carrier said it will fly 19 fewer routes and 230 fewer flights per week in the winter. That's equivalent to 
40% fewer flights than it operated from the German capital in winter 2019.
"High airport costs in Berlin make it more attractive to base aircraft at better value airports in other areas of 
Germany and Europe," Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement on October 13, 2022.
O'Leary commented that other airports in Germany "understand that competitive charges are necessary to support 
traffic recovery" after the COVID-19 pandemic.
It's not the first time that the low-cost carrier has criticized what it deems high charges at German airports. Ryanair 
closed its base at Frankfurt airport (FRA) in March 2022, citing high airport charges.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has announced it will reopen its base at Toulouse Blagnac, closed during the peak of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, starting with the Winter 2022/23 season.
The Irish low-cost carrier plans to base two B737-800s and operate 23 routes out of the French airport, including 
seven new destinations not served previously (Birmingham Int'l, Luxembourgs, Rabat, Tenerife Sur, Venice 
Treviso, Rome Fiumicino, and Kraków). Flights will be operated by Malta Air (MAY, Malta Int'l). Toulouse will be the 
fourth Ryanair base in France after Paris Beauvais (operated by Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l)), Bordeaux, and 
Marseilles (both operated by Malta Air), the ch-aviation PRO airlines module shows.
Ryanair opened its base at Toulouse airport in March 2020 according to a schedule announced before the COVID-
19 pandemic began. As the crisis hit European aviation, the airline suspended all operations from Toulouse in 
November 2020. It restarted flights to the city in March 2021, albeit without reactivating the base.
Toulouse already hosts bases for rival LCCs easyJet Europe (EC, Vienna) and Volotea (V7, Asturias). Ryanair 
currently has a 14.9% market share by scheduled departure capacity out of the airport, behind Air France (AF, Paris 
CDG) and easyJet, according to the ch-aviation capacities module.

EASYJET is expected to post a loss for the third consecutive year, despite increasing earnings over the busy 
summer quarter.
The low-cost carrier said yesterday that losses are expected to be in the range of £170m-£190m for the year ended 
30 September as a result of the travel disruption experienced over the last few months.
In a trading update yesterday, Easyjet reported that £75m of losses were due to incremental disruption costs while 
£64m derived from the effect of exchange rates.
Chief executive Johan Lundgren said that the company will nonetheless break even this year, as it booked between 
£525m and £545m in quarterly earnings during the summer.
In the three months to September, the airline carried 26.3m people aboard its planes, operating at 88 per cent of 
2019 levels, while load factor was at 92 per cent.
Despite an uncertain environment, Easyjet said demand for this winter and the coming year was holding up, with 
early indications for the first quarter of 2023 remaining positive.
Easyjet's performance stands in stark contrast with rival Ryanair, which is expected to grow even with an economic 
recession.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters yesterday it was forecasting higher fares for the year ending 
March due to "surprisingly strong" bookings.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) expects its underlying airfares to increase by a mid to high single-digit figure in the financial year 
ending March 2023, Reuters reported Thursday, citing Chief Executive Michael O'Leary. 
The Irish budget airline's latest predictions follow the strong volume and pricing of its bookings for the autumn mid-
term and Christmas holidays season, which are ahead of their pre-COVID-19 levels, according to the report. 
The increased demand is triggered by customer savings collected over the pandemic. However, their disposable 
income is likely to be impacted by interest rate rises and the cost of living further into the northern hemisphere 
winter, O'Leary told the newswire. 
Shares in Ryanair rose above 3% at the close of trading on Thursday.

Oct 14, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair (RYAAY) shares soared 5% in the last trading session to close at $59.76. The move was backed by solid 
volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 17.2% loss 
over the past four weeks. 
The uptick in RYAAY shares was part of a broader rally by European airline stocks on Oct 13. The rally was owing 
to encouraging forecasts from Intercontinental Consolidated Airline Group and easyJet plc as air-travel demand 
bounces back strongly from the pandemic lows. Per easyJet's CEO Johan Lundgren "easyJet achieved a record 
bounce back this summer with Q4 operating profit expected to be between 525m and 545m and passenger 
numbers almost doubling versus last summer to 24 million with a load factor of 92%, as demand for our leading 
network and services remains strong,' Intercontinental Consolidated Airline Group expects operating profit for the 
third quarter to be around EUR1.2 billion driven by high passenger revenues. 
RYAAY is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.73 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-
over-year change of +394%. Revenues are expected to be $4.02 billion, up 91.3% from the year-ago quarter. 
While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, 
empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock 
price movements. 
For Ryanair, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a 
stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, 
make sure to keep an eye on RYAAY going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the 
road. 
The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy) stocks here  > > > >[1] 
Ryanair is a member of the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry. One other stock in the same industry, Frontier 
Group Holdings (ULCC), finished the last trading session 2.2% lower at $9.25. ULCC has returned -25.7% over the 
past month. 
For Frontier Group, the consensus EPS estimate for the upcoming report has changed +29% over the past month 
to $0.10. This represents a change of +190.9% from what the company reported a year ago. Frontier Group 
currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

Digitisation always leads to an increase in costs, as effectively the work has to be done twice, that is taking the 
information and then uploading it. 
There are also significant extra costs in terms of maintaining the relevant software etc. 
3.2 What is the impact on costs of pre-action protocols and portals? 
3.3 Is there a need to reform the processes of assessing costs when a claim settles before issue, including both 
solicitor own client costs, and party and party costs? 
3.4 What purpose(s) does the current distinction between contentious business and non-contentious business 
serve? Should it be retained? 
I can deal with these together. 
A key issue concerns assessing costs before court proceedings begin, and a recognition that in an age of portals, 
protocols and digital justice, whatever that means, there is not such an obvious point where the Rubicon is crossed, 
and proceedings are issued. 
For example, in the existing portal system for personal injury work, do proceedings begin when: 
i. The Claim Notification Form is lodged on the portal; or 
ii. when Stage 3 is engaged, and a court fee paid; or 
iii. only when the matter drops out of the process and substantive Part 7 proceedings are issued? 
Pre-issue work is non-contentious, but becomes retrospectively contentious once proceedings are issued, which is 
why in a matter settled pre-issue there needs to be a contractual provision for costs, e.g.: 
'The defendant will pay the claimant's reasonable costs to be assessed if not agreed.' 
CIVIL JUSTICE COUNCIL COSTS WORKING GROUP CONSULTATION PAPER - JUNE 2022 - DEADLINE 
12 NOON TODAY
What is, or is not, contentious, or a dispute, was considered recently by the Supreme Court in 
Bott & Co Solicitors Ltd v Ryanair DAC [2022] UKSC 8 (16 March 2022)[1] 
and remains to be ruled upon by the Court of Appeal in the seemingly endless saga of 
Belsner v Cam Legal Services Ltd [2020] EWHC 2755 (QB)[2]  
In the absence of an entitlement to costs pre-issue, there is an incentive to issue, which goes against current 
Government and Judicial thinking, partly, or even mainly, because of the shortage of judges and resources. 
That is a different issue from the desirability of certainty in relation to costs where matters are resolved through a 
quasi-Judicial pre-issue portal process. 
Both the existing personal injury pre-action process, and the general civil litigation fixed recoverable costs scheme 
from April 2023, provide an entitlement to fixed costs where the matter is settled pre-issue. 
However, there is a fundamental difference between personal injury work and other civil litigation, in that Qualified 
One-Way Costs Shifting means that an unsuccessful personal injury claimant generally does not pay the successful 
defendant's costs. 
In general civil litigation they do. Creating that liability pre-issue means that a putative claimant who does not go 
ahead with the claim is liable for the un-sued defendant's costs. 
Let us take an example. 
It is April 2023. Charlie Claimant writes the email from hell to Denise Defendant claiming 100,000 and saying that it 
is a Band 4 case with maximum fixed recoverable costs. 
Denise Defendant politely tells Charlie Claimant to go away and no further action is taken. 
Under the new system the putative claimant has to pay the un-sued defendant 16,000 (see page 106 of Lord 
Justice Jackson's Supplemental Report: Fixed Recoverable Costs). 
That will come as a shock to some of the more aggressive litigators and their clients, and it throws up many issues. 
When does liability crystalize? 
In issued proceedings it would be on defeat, or on Notice of Discontinuance. Is there to be a form of pre-action 
strike out, so that if no action is taken for three months or whatever, then the inactive claimant becomes liable for 
costs? 
Can a claimant keep it jogging along - at no extra costs as they are fixed - for the six-year limitation period? 
What about a Litigant in Person who writes an email with it never occurring to them that they are thus engaging in a 
cost bearing litigation process? 
Where does the system draw a line between, at one end, a mild Letter of Complaint, and at the other a full-blown 
Letter before Action? 
The risk is that a digital process will be seen as a form of litigation and have the consequences of deterring parties 
from engaging and thus have exactly the opposite of the intended effect. 
Small businesses in particular are concerned about this. 
At the Civil Justice Council meeting there was a general view that there should be pre-issue costs liability, but no 
consensus on where to draw the line. 
Whatever happens, it is hard now to justify the distinction between contentious and non-contentious business, and 
surely it is time that these terms were scrapped. 
Likewise, the indemnity principle, which in any event has no application in fixed recoverable costs cases - see 
Butt v Nizami [2006] EWHC 159 (QB)[3] 
The related matters of costs under pre-action protocols and portals and the digital justice system on the one hand, 
and fixed recoverable costs for pre-issue work whether the matter becomes issued or not, are of great importance if 
the desire is to have matters settled pre-issue. 
At present there are more questions than answers.

There's a lot of concern over rising inflation and cost pressures and how it will affect spending on air travel, but 
bookings are holding up so far, according to statements by major European airlines.
IAG, which owns British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, said trading during the third quarter of 2022 was 
better than expected and bookings for the rest of the year are normal.
"Forward bookings remain at expected levels for the time of year, with no indication of weakness, and accordingly 
our fourth quarter expectations remain unchanged as of today," the group said in a brief statement to the stock 
exchange on October 13.
Thanks to the strong summer performance, IAG said it expects a pre-exceptional operating profit of approximately 
(EURO)1.2 billion ($1.17 billion) for the third quarter to September 30, 2022.
Summer 2023 bookings
Meanwhile, low-cost carriers easyJet and Ryanair delivered some positive news too.
easyJet gave an update on its financial results for its financial year, which ends on September 30, 2022. While it is 
predicting a loss before tax of between £170 million and £190 million ($190-$213 million) for the year as a whole, it 
returned to profit in the final quarter, which covers the key summer period. In the fourth quarter, easyJet expects 
headline earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to be between £525 million and £545 million.
For the first quarter of the new financial year, the budget carrier said UK capacity during the peak travel periods 
such as October half terms and Christmas was back to pre-pandemic levels. "Bookings continue to progress well 
with load factors ahead of the same point in FY19 and yields remain robust," easyJet commented in the October 13 
statement.
Further ahead, chief executive Johan Lundgren said passengers were already snapping up tickets for summer 
2023.
"Our summer 23 season went on sale last week and we were filling the equivalent of more than four A320 aircraft a 
minute in the opening hours demonstrating the continued demand," Lundgren commented.

 British Airways-owner IAG, Europe's biggest airline Ryanair and rival easyJet said demand for travel was holding 
up, calming worries that pressure on household budgets could stall aviation's recovery from the pandemic. 
Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd also said on Thursday it was seeing consumers willing to pay higher fares despite 
rising inflation and interest rates. 
Shares in IAG jumped as much as 10% after an unscheduled announcement on Thursday to report better than 
expected profit for its summer quarter and a confident outlook. Meanwhile, Ryanair said its bookings for the 
northern hemisphere autumn mid-term and Christmas holidays are ahead of pre-COVID levels and it sees average 
fares rising by more than expected until the end of March. 
In Europe, most airline stocks have plunged over the last six months, some by as much as 50%, over worries that 
rising household bills will dampen appetite for travel. 
But the airlines injected optimism back into the market on Thursday. 
IAG, which also owns the Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling airlines, said forward bookings remain at expected levels 
for this time of year "with no indication of weakness". 
CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM 
Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet which had earlier issued forecasts for its annual results, was more 
cautious, saying that there was "uncertainty out there", but the low-cost operator also said there was cause for 
optimism. 
"Despite the difficulties that households have, we still know that holidays and travel are top of the list when people 
can prioritise what they want to do with their disposable income," he told reporters.  
For Britain's October school holiday and the Christmas week, easyJet said ticket sales exceeded pre-pandemic 
levels and load factors - a measure of seats filled - for winter bookings and pricing were robust. 
Analysts noted that the strength of the dollar against the pound and the euro lately has made it cheaper for 
American visitors to come to Britain and Europe, a particular boost for IAG which has a large exposure to the 
transatlantic market. 
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said that demand appeared to be supported by savings built up during 
the pandemic but he sounded a note of caution over how long that could endure, saying he does expect that

customers' disposable income will get hit by increases in interest rates and the cost of living further into the northern 
hemisphere winter. 
That was echoed by Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Sophie Lund-Yates who said IAG's upgrade was "a very 
welcome surprise, but whether the spritely mood music can be maintained is another question entirely".

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) is "a long-term winner", said broker Liberum, but added that short-term pressures 
in the market have led it to downgrade its rating to 'hold', with the target price cut to (EURO)11 from (EURO)16.5.
Analysts at the bank believe the discount airline group is on course to return to pre-pandemic levels of profitability 
after a strong summer.
However, consensus beyond this year appears to "imply a series of optimistic assumptions that may leave little 
room for outperformance", Liberum said.
That includes a double-digit fare increase for next year, which is not impossible but requires restraint in capacity 
plans by the industry and avoidance of recession, it said.
Additionally, while low-cost airlines tend to fare better in times of recession, they are still not immune.
Liberum noted potential opportunities to generate incremental savings, including the carrier's Boeing 737-8200 
MAX aircraft burning 16% less fuel and having 4% more seats, as well robust negotiations on airport charges, with 
slower recovery in capacity from competitors adding to its bargaining power.
However, Liberum expects this to be balanced by inflation from air traffic control charges at airports where it does 
not have discount deals in place.
Ryanair is 'a long-term winner' but short-term pressures persist, says Liberum
Still, the broker believes Ryanair is a long-term winner in the European airline industry, underpinned by its market 
leadership in the Europe's short-haul market, low unit costs, robust exploitation of its bargaining power wherever 
possible, pan-European network footprint and strong balance sheet.
