Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
During the month, the Company's NAV rose 1.9% and the share price increased by
 5.3%.  For reference, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index was up 0.2% during the
 period.
Europe ex UK equity markets were flat in December (GBP terms), bringing returns
 for 2015 to 5.1%.  The weak Euro slightly muted the strength of returns in the
 market in Sterling terms.  As with much of the quarter, focus in December was
 on global central bank actions.  After some mixed macro data and lower
 inflation, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced the second phase of
 quantitative easing at the start of December, with the US Federal Reserve
 raising interest rates for the first time in nearly 10 years in mid-December.
 Market expectations of the scale of the ECB action were not quite met - while
 the extension of the timeframe was welcomed, the lack of increase in the
 monthly programme size disappointed.  While the short term market reaction was
 negative, Draghi has effectively reinforced the longer term commitment to
 underwrite nominal economic growth in the Eurozone and this remains a positive
 environment for European corporate earnings to grow.
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
Stock selection drove the Company's performance when compared with the
 reference index during December, whilst the contribution from sector allocation
 was also marginally additive.  The gains incurred on a sector basis were
 primarily driven by the Company's lower weight to basic materials.  The sector
 continues to feel pressure from slower global growth, particularly from China,
 and falling commodity prices.  Likewise, the Company's lower exposure to oil &
 gas provided a positive contribution to returns.  The Company's greater
 exposure to industrials, when compared with the reference index, hampered
 performance on a relative sector basis; however, this was far outweighed by
 strong stock specific returns in this industry.
The Company's largest contributor over the month was Irish airline Ryanair
 which reported a continued strength in traffic.  Within this, the load factors,
 which indicate the amount of a flight's capacity filled, have increased
 year-on-year.  Reported total passengers continues to far exceed that of its
 peers.  The Company also benefited from a holding in Novo Nordisk.  Q3 results
 provided comfort to investors, as did the guidance given for 2016.
Within industrials, Dassault Aviation also performed strongly.  The stock
 bounced back from oversold levels following upgrades.  The news of the receipt
 of Qatar's down payment for the 24 Rafale aircraft ordered was also well
 received by the market.
The largest detractor over the month was Electrolux.  During the month, a
 potentially accretive deal to buy GE's Appliance business fell through.  The
 resulting break fee of US$175m and reduced M&A potential weighed heavily on the
 share price.  Despite a strong competitive position, Sberbank also
 underperformed as the Ruble and Russian equities sold-off in response to a
 lower oil price.
At the end of the period, the Company had higher weightings when compared with
 the reference index to financials, technology, consumer services, industrials
 and health care.  The Company had lower exposure to consumer goods, basic
 materials, oil & gas, utilities and telecoms.
Outlook
Despite the uncertain macroeconomic outlook in 2016 across different regions,
 we remain constructive on European equities which have a more supportive
 environment in the face of diverging monetary policy cycles between the US and
 Europe.  The incremental support from the ECB through expansion of the current
 QE programme will, in our view, have a further positive impact on European GDP
 growth and the credit cycle.  However, one question mark remains over earnings
 growth in 2016 which we forecast to be mid-to-high single digit level, still
 impacted by both energy and materials sectors, and weak capital expenditure
 trends, but benefiting from the Euro weakness.  In our view, a weak Euro,
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 subdued wage growth, expanding domestic credit and some additional profit
 margin normalisation should all support corporate earnings in 2016 in
 Continental Europe, whilst the UK is likely to face more headwinds on this
 front.  The main risk to this scenario comes from a bigger than expected
 slowdown in the US and China.  The tightening of US interest rates provides a
 headwind to USD global liquidity and the implications of this need to be
 closely monitored.  In this context, individual stock selection remains
 critical.

Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "On the back of lower fares in December (following the terrorist events in Paris and Brussels), Ryanair's monthly 
traffic grew by 25% to 7.5m customers, while our load factor jumped 3% points to 91%. Our traffic growth over the 
past two years has been remarkable, rising by 50% over our December 2013 traffic figure of 5.0m.
 We are pleased that over 101m international customers chose to fly with Ryanair in 2015, as we became the first 
airline to reach this international traffic landmark. This is thanks to our load factor active/yield passive pricing, our 
expanding route network and the continuing success of our "Always Getting Better" customer experience 
programme, which continues to deliver stronger than expected traffic and load factors, albeit at lower fares."

 To celebrate our new Belfast International base we are releasing over 100,000 seats on sale at prices 
from just GBP9.99 for travel in March, April and May, which must be booked by Monday (11 Jan). Since these 
amazing low prices will be snapped up quickly, customers should log onto www.ryanair.com and avoid missing 
out."
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR TO OPEN BELFAST BASE (NO. 77)
 Graham Keddie, MD of Belfast International Airport, said:
 "This is a significant and far-reaching announcement by Ryanair. The Gatwick slots given up by Aer Lingus 
as part of the IAG takeover, are being safeguarded and used for the benefit of Northern Ireland. Gatwick 
is growing in popularity, and it was crucial to retain them.
 In addition, the promise of three based aircraft and 5 more new routes to be announced later in the year 
increases Northern Ireland's 'reach' and gives Belfast International a competitive edge. This very 
positive news is the equivalent of a major inward investment without the strain on public finances. It 
will deliver thousands of new visitors and hundreds of welcome new jobs. Despite the damaging Air 
Passenger Duty (APD), this announcement shows Belfast International can defy the odds. Just imagine what 
we could achieve if the 'yoke' of APD were removed (as it has been in the Republic of Ireland)?"

 instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
 As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same or 
different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) the 
standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.

(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who

 (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) to 
(h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should
 be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to the natural person or legal entity 
referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations
 (Article 10 Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is 
lower than the lowest notifiable threshold
 for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the requirements of the Regulations and

 (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason
 triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the date when the corporate event took 
effect.
 (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository

another undertaking then the second option
 applies.
 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or 
legal entity, has to be presented also in
 cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking 
discloses the notification, as only
 thus will the markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through 
which the voting rights and/or financial
 instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row free 
between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free
 row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented
 irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest applicable threshold 
themselves.
 (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

 RYANAIR DELIVERS 70% OF IRISH TOURISM GROWTH IN 2015
 Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (29 Dec) released its 2015 Irish traffic numbers which show 
it has delivered 70% of all traffic growth at Cork, Dublin, Knock and Shannon airports in 2015, a year of 
record growth for Irish tourism.
 Following the decision of Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, to scrap air travel tax in April 2014, 
Ryanair has continued to roll out new routes and more frequencies on existing routes, including our new 4 
x daily Dublin to Amsterdam service. The annual figures revealed that:
 --    Traffic growth at Irish airports in 2015 rose by 3.3m to 29.8m
 --    Ryanair delivered 13.1m customers though Irish airports (44% of total)
 --    Ryanair delivered 2.2m (70%) of this 3.3m traffic increase
 With over 130 routes to/from Ireland, Ryanair will carry over 14m customers through Irish airports in 
2016, on new routes including Dublin to Amsterdam, Athens and Copenhagen, as more and more visitors choose 
Ryanair for our lowest fares, our widest choice of routes and our unbeatable punctuality and performance.
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 "Before the various tourism bodies claim undue credit for a record year for Irish tourism, Ryanair is 
pleased to release its 2015 Irish traffic numbers, which show that Ryanair on its own delivered 70% of the 
growth at the main Irish airports this year, thanks to the Government's decision to scrap the air travel 
tax.
 After 5 years of decline at Irish airports, the welcome repeal of the air travel tax has resulted in 
record traffic and tourism growth, demonstrating to our counterparts in the UK and Germany the enormous 
economic benefits removing APD brings.
 Ryanair will continue to invest in our network and we look forward to welcoming more and more visitors to 
Ireland on Ryanair's low fare services, as millions of customers choose our low fares, the largest route 
network in Europe and our "Always Getting Better" customer experience."

 instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
 As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same or 
different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) the 
standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.

 (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) to 
(h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should
 be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to the natural person or legal entity 
referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations
 (Article 10 Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is 
lower than the lowest notifiable threshold
 for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the requirements of the Regulations and 
the Transparency Rules.
 (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason
 triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the date when the corporate event took

receipts representing shares, to which voting
 rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is suspended.

 is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as

another undertaking then the second option applies.
 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or 
legal entity, has to be presented also in
 cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking 
discloses the notification, as only
 thus will the markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through 
which the voting rights and/or financial
 instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row free 
between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free
 row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented
 irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest applicable threshold 
themselves.
 (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

 (ii) Full name of the legal entity and other identifying specification of the issuer or underlying 
issuer, provided it is reliable and accurate (e.g. address, LEI, domestic number identity).
 (iii) Other reason for the notification could be voluntary notifications, changes of attribution of the 
nature of the holding (e.g. expiring of financial instruments) or acting in concert.
 (iv) This should be the full name of (a) the shareholder; (b) the natural person or legal entity 
acquiring, disposing of or exercising voting rights in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h)

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
 As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same or 
different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) the 
standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
 In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring 
temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person or 
entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or 
legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity who has a life interest in shares if that

 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC),

 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit

Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
 (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) to 
(h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to 
the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 Directive 
2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest 
notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the requirements of 
the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
 (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
 (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
 (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the Regulations 
and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding only that the 
holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
 (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.

ends.
 (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once every 
3 months starting from [date].
 (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be presented 
on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
 (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or 
legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
 (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
During the month, the Company's NAV rose 2.3% and the share price rose by 1.3%.
 For reference, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index was up 0.8% during the period.
European equity markets gained in November, although returns in sterling were
 moderated by a weak Euro. The market was boosted by a combination of solid
 economic data (Euro-area composite Purchasing Manager's Index touched 54) and
 anticipation of further stimulatory measures from the European Central Bank in
 December's governing council meeting. Indeed, a further 4% weakening of the
 Euro against the dollar - a net positive for European corporate earnings - was
 perhaps the most notable movement in the month as prominent ECB council members
 referenced the low inflation rate in the run up to the meeting. On a sector
 basis, autos & parts performed best along with industrials, but basic resources
 and real estate lagged the broad market.
Stock selection drove the Company's performance when compared with the
 reference index during November, whilst the contribution from sector allocation
 was flat. The gains incurred on a sector basis from the Company's lower weight
 to utilities, were offset by the losses from the higher weighting to the
 financials sector. A lower weighting to the oil & gas sector also negatively
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 impacted performance as the commodities complex saw some relief at the onset of
 the month.
Pharmaceutical and health care equipment and services names featured highly
 amongst top contributors. Whilst holdings in Novo Nordisk and William Demant
 performed strongly, driven by solid trial data and acquisition actions
 respectively, not holding Sanofi proved the largest relative contributor over
 the month. The stock fell almost 10% on the back of a profit warning.
Holdings in a number of industrial names also provided positive returns.
 Kingspan exhibited strong performance following expectations from management
 that full year trading profits for 2015 would be 7-8% ahead of consensus.
 Additionally, Assa Abloy and Saft Groupe contributed positively, the latter
 rallying 20% with the announcement of a capital repurchase programme.
The Company saw detractions from LVMH on the back of weak trading in the US.
 Travel provider Tui and Aeroports De Paris also detracted from performance amid
 the heightened terror alerts across Europe following the tragic attacks in
 Paris.
At the end of the period, the Company had higher weightings when compared with
 the reference index to financials, technology, consumer services, industrials
 and health care. The Company had lower exposure to consumer goods, basic
 materials, oil & gas, utilities and telecoms.
Outlook
Despite an overall disappointing third quarter earnings reporting season, we
 remain constructive on European equities which are showing a degree of
 resilience in the face of divergence of monetary policy cycles between the US
 and Europe. The incremental support from the ECB, through expansion of the
 current Quantitative Easing programme, will in our view have a further positive
 impact on European GDP growth and the credit cycle. However, one question mark
 remains over earnings growth next year which we forecast to be mid-to-high
 single digit level, still impacted by energy and materials sectors but
 benefiting from the Euro weakness. European valuations are not as attractive as
 they were twelve months ago, and we believe that we need to see the earnings
 coming through to drive further meaningful upside next year.  In our view, a
 weak Euro, subdued wage growth and expanding domestic credit should all support
 corporate earnings in 2016 in Continental Europe. In this context, stock
 selection remains critical and we remain of the view that consumers will
 continue to lead the recovery globally, specifically in Europe where domestic
 companies fared better this year overall.

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
 As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same or 
different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) the 
standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
 In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring 
temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of

entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or 
legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity who has a life interest in shares if that

or legal entity who is disposing of the voting rights when the life interest is created;
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC),

Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
 (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) to 
(h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to 
the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 Directive 
2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest 
notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the requirements of 
the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
 (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
 (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
 (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the Regulations 
and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding only that the 
holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.

 (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or 
legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
 (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "Ryanair's November traffic grew by 21% to 7.71m customers, while our load factor jumped 5% points to 93%. 
These record monthly numbers and load factors are due to our lower fares, our stronger forward bookings and the 
continuing success of our "Always Getting Better" customer experience programme, which continues to deliver 
stronger than expected traffic and load factors.
 Ryanair customers can now look forward to more service enhancements, as we continue Year 2 of our AGB 
programme, which includes our new car hire service, new website, new app, new cabin interiors, new crew 
uniforms, and improved inflight menus, as Ryanair continues to deliver so much more than just the lowest fares in 
Europe."

 RYANAIR LAUNCHES HIGH COURT ACTION ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS TO PREVENT EDREAMS & 
GOOGLE DECEIVING CONSUMERS WITH MISLEADING ADVERTS AND FALSE PRICES
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (1 Dec) announced that it had launched High Court proceedings against 
both eDreams and Google to stop them misleading consumers by advertising non-existent Ryanair fares via the 
eDreams website and Google search adverts. These practises are prohibited by consumer legislation. As a result, 
Ryanair has also put the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on notice of the proceedings.
 Screenscraper website eDreams has been allowed by Google to use the misleading subdomains "Ryanair Cheap 
Flights" and "www.Ryanair.eDreams.com", and a copycat website with identical Ryanair branding, in order to 
deceive consumers into visiting the eDreams website, and booking with eDreams at inflated fares.
 Ryanair has engaged in several legal cases across Europe against screenscraper websites such as eDreams to 
prevent consumers from being deceived and subjected to false prices and hidden charges. Consumers are also 
faced with a range of problems when booking through eDreams, such as checked in bags not being recorded, 
contact details being omitted and additional passengers not being recognised or added to the booking.
 Ryanair has no issues with Google selling advertising space, but has repeatedly called on Google to enforce 
transparency on its online advertising following numerous complaints from Ryanair customers who were deceived 
into buying on the eDreams website when they thought they were booking on Ryanair.com. Following Google's 
refusal to stop these false advertising practices (which are in breach of Google's own code of conduct), Ryanair has 
been left with no alternative than to take legal proceedings against both eDreams and Google in the Irish High 
Courts.
 Ryanair's CMO Kenny Jacobs said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR TAKES LEGAL CASE AGAINST EDREAMS & GOOGLE
 "This Google/eDreams action is a repeat of a recently successful German court ruling which has outlawed 
eDreams deceptive advertising in Germany. This deception and mis-selling has led to a surge of consumer 
complaints and leaves Ryanair with no choice but to take legal action against both Google and eDreams, who 
continue to use Google search adverts to deceive consumers into booking Ryanair flights on the eDreams website 
at inflated fares. Both the subdomain eDreams uses, and the branding and design it employs on this site, are a 
deliberate attempt to dupe consumers into thinking they are directly booking Ryanair's low fares.
 Ryanair has no commercial agreement with eDreams, who continue to advertise false fares and unlawfully mis-
sells Ryanair fares with hidden handling fees. Our repeated calls for greater Google advert transparency, or for 
Google to comply with their own code of conduct, have been ignored, and in order to prevent 1,000's more 
consumers being misled on the Google search engine, we have commenced these High Court proceedings.
 We have no problem with Google charging advertisers on its paid search function, but we expect Google to ensure 
that this advertising is honest and transparent (namely that eDreams advertises as "eDreams" and not as Ryanair), 
which is what Google's own code of conduct requires and which will prevent more ordinary consumers being 
deceived by this false and unlawful advertising scam. The German courts have already outlawed this eDreams 
false advertising, and its time the Irish and UK courts did the same to protect consumers."

STRATEGIC REPORT
The Strategic Report has been prepared in accordance with Section 414A of the
 Companies Act 2006 (the "Act"). Its purpose is to inform members of the Company
 and help them assess how the Directors have performed their legal duty under
 Section 172 of the Act to promote the success of the Company.
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
European Inv Tst Plc Annual Financial Report -2-
Results
 After the positive return seen in the prior year, the year under review was a
 more challenging period for investing in European equities, with much weaker
 markets in the final six months of our year, together with a currency headwind
 from a weaker euro. In the year to 30 September 2015, the net asset value
 ("NAV") per share of your Company decreased by 7.3% from 800.41p to 742.20p.
 After taking account of dividends paid in the year of 15.0p, the NAV total
 return was -5.5%. This compares with the total return of -1.8% from the FTSE
 All-World Europe ex UK Index, adjusted to sterling.
During the year, the Company's share price decreased by 10.1% from 748.75p to
 673.00p. The share price discount to NAV per share, which had been over 18%
 within the previous two years, rose in the year under review from 6.5% to 9.3%.
 The share price total return, taking account of the 15.0p dividend paid in the
 year, was -8.3%.
From the appointment of Edinburgh Partners as Investment Manager on 1 February
 2010, the share price total return to 30 September 2015 was 47.9% and the NAV
 total return 38.2%. This compares with the total return of 36.8% from the FTSE
 All-World Europe ex UK Index, adjusted to sterling.
Revenue
 There was a 1.10p increase in revenue return per share in the year to 30
 September 2015 from 14.85p to 15.95p, an increase of 7.4%. The Company
 continues to have a low ongoing charges ratio, despite there being an increase
 from 0.61% last year to 0.63% in the year to 30 September 2015.
Dividends
 The Board recommends a final dividend of 14.0p per share and a special dividend
 of 2.0p per share, a total of 16.0p per share. The proposed total dividend of
 16.0p compares with the prior year total dividend of 15.0p. For the prior year,
 the final dividend was 14.0p and a special dividend of 1.0p was paid. Our aim
 is to pay a final dividend which we regard as likely to be sustainable and to
 distribute any further earnings by way of a special dividend.
Subject to the approval of shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General
 Meeting, these dividends will be paid on 29 January 2016 to shareholders on the
 register at the close of business on 8 January 2016. The ex-dividend date will
 be 7 January 2016.
Share buybacks
 The Board has continued to monitor the discount at which the shares trade
 relative to the NAV per share. As detailed above in the Results section, there
 was an increase in the share price discount to NAV per share during the year
 under review. No share buybacks were made during the year.
The Directors will again propose at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting that
European Inv Tst Plc Annual Financial Report -2-
 the Company's powers to make purchases of up to 14.99% of its shares in issue
 be renewed.
Portfolio activity
 The most significant sector change was in the consumer goods sector, where
 exposure was reduced from 15.9% to 6.6%. There was relatively little change in
 the country exposure of the portfolio. The most significant change was in
 Norway where, at the prior year-end, there was no exposure and there is now a
 4.8% weighting, following the purchases of DNB and Petroleum Geo-Services.
The Company remained almost fully invested throughout the year and cash and
 other net assets remained at low levels, marginally increasing from 0.9% to
 1.3% of net assets during the year. There was a reduction in the number of
 investments held from 41 to 37. For further commentary on portfolio activity,
 see the Investment Manager's Report below.
The Board
 In reviewing Board composition during the year, the Board agreed that the
 appointment of an additional Director would assist with succession planning.
 After consideration of potential candidates, the Board is pleased to announce
 the appointment of Mr Michael MacPhee with effect from 1 January 2016. Mr
 MacPhee was until 2014 an investment partner in Baillie Gifford & Co., heading
 the firm's European Department from 2003 to 2008 and thereafter co-managing a
 global investment strategy. Having been called to the English Bar in 1987, he
 joined the firm in 1989 and from 1998 to 2014 he was the manager of Mid Wynd
 International Investment Trust plc. He therefore has an extensive knowledge of
 financial markets and of investment trusts in particular. The Board recommends
 a vote in favour of resolution number 5 contained in the Notice of Annual
 General Meeting for the election of Mr MacPhee as a Director of the Company.
Annual General Meeting
 We hope that as many shareholders as possible will attend the Annual General
 Meeting, which will be held at 11.00 am on Tuesday, 26 January 2016 at Brewers'
 Hall, Aldermanbury Square, London EC2V 7HR. We look forward to meeting all
 shareholders who are able to attend.
Outlook
 For much of the year under review, European equity markets favoured companies
 which have the lowest perceived earnings risk. The outperformance of these
 stocks was fuelled not by any material changes to their profits outlook, but by
 their valuations returning to historic relative peaks; this constituted a
 headwind for our relative performance. However, the Investment Manager believes
 that a significant number of the stocks within the portfolio remain undervalued
 and should rebound. We have therefore maintained or added to our positions in
 the majority of our underperforming stocks and are close to being fully
 invested.

INVESTMENT MANAGER'S REPORT
Economic and Market Overview
 A consistent theme of the protracted recovery from the global financial crisis
 and the Eurozone crisis has been fragility. Immediately after these combined
 crises, the very construct of the Eurozone was vulnerable and it did not take
 much, either internally or externally, to damage economic and market
 confidence. However, in the first half of 2015, the Eurozone economy achieved
 close to trend economic growth at 1.8%. One encouraging aspect of Europe's
 economic performance is that, with Greek risks very much to the fore, the
 economy appeared to shrug off these concerns and respond to the stimulus which
 is in place. This stimulus comes primarily from monetary policy but is also
 aided by the lower oil price and currency. There was therefore optimism that
 the Eurozone was showing signs of increased resilience to the various risks it
 faces.
However, as the year progressed and with equity market valuations becoming
 elevated, worries about global economic growth started to appear. Although
 these concerns originated with China, they also encompassed the US economy, by
 now quite far advanced into its own economic growth cycle. The net effect of
 these factors is that Europe will end the year with a reasonable, albeit
 slightly sub-trend, year of economic growth. However, there is now more
 confidence in its ability to withstand negative influences.
In aggregate, European stock markets responded well to the improving growth but
 gave up these gains as the risks to growth became more apparent. Throughout the
 year, the markets continued to reward stocks which were delivering stable,
 predictable growth with ever higher valuations. This has led to what we regard
 as a significant valuation anomaly and, therefore, an opportunity.
Portfolio Strategy and Activity
 At the heart of our investment approach at Edinburgh Partners is a very strong
 valuation discipline, an approach based on a traditional style of investing. In
 the current European stock market environment, a significant proportion of the
 market is trading at a valuation level which we feel is inconsistent with the
 profit growth these companies are able to sustain. This is the opportunity. We
 continued to rotate your portfolio away from companies with these
 characteristics towards companies where we feel expectations have become too
 depressed. This is usually due to a lack of visibility over the immediate
 future. A number of examples of portfolio activity during the year are detailed
 below.

 RYANAIR CONCLUDES 5 YEAR PAY DEALS AT ALL 76 PILOT BASES
 AS ITS 2 LARGEST CABIN CREW BASES (DUB & STN) VOTE TO ACCEPT NEW IMPROVED 5 YEAR DEALS
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (25 Nov) held its annual European Works Council (EWC) meeting 
in Dublin where it announced that it had concluded 5 year pay agreements with all 76 of its pilot bases 
across Europe, and has now commenced a similar process with its cabin crew, after its 2 largest bases at 
Dublin and London Stansted airports voted (in secret ballot) to accept 5 year deals incorporating pay 
increases, improved rosters and rapid promotion opportunities, as Ryanair's low fare model continues to 
grow strongly.
 Following weeks of direct negotiations between Ryanair and its elected cabin crew representatives, using 
long established collective bargaining structures, Ryanair's cabin crew at its Dublin and London Stansted 
bases have voted, by over 90%, to accept new 5 year pay agreements which will deliver:
 -    Guaranteed pay and allowance increases each year over the next 4 years
 -    Improved fixed rosters with 5 days on, 3 days off (a bank holiday every week)
 -    Improved sickness benefits
 -    New cabin crew uniforms
 -    More promotion opportunities as Ryanair embarks on an 8 year, 400 aircraft acquisition program
 The successful conclusion of these deals means that pilots at all 76 Ryanair bases, and now the cabin 
crew at Ryanair's 2 largest bases (Dublin and London Stansted), have secured improved pay and condition 
deals which will provide them with increased pay and job security over the next 5 years. New cabin crew 
negotiations will now commence at all of Ryanair's other cabin crew bases.
 Ryanair's Chief People Officer, Eddie Wilson said:
 "The last 10 months have been an extremely busy period for Ryanair's people. Not alone have we rolled out 
year 2 of our "Always Getting Better" programme, while delivering increased load factors and industry 
leading traffic growth, but we have also been working hard behind the scenes to negotiate and conclude 
improved pay and condition deals for all our frontline teams.
 Having this year completed 5 year pay deals for all of our 76 pilot bases, we are now rolling this 
process out to our cabin crew bases, starting with the two largest at Dublin and Stansted, where we have 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CONCLUDES 5 YEAR PAY DEALS AT PILOT BASES
now negotiated improved pay and better roster deal for our cabin crew. We will now roll this process out 
to the 74 other cabin crew bases across Europe.
 The fact that Ryanair is continuing to use our improving financial performance to improve the pay and 
conditions of our frontline people underlines the long standing success of Ryanair's collective bargaining 
model, which continues to deliver improved pay and conditions as well as job security for our pilots and 
cabin crew at a time when their counterparts in other European airlines are facing job cuts, pay cuts or 
are engaged in industrial action.
 We are extremely proud that during the 30 year history of Ryanair, our customers have never been 
disrupted by a strike by Ryanair people. This is a record unmatched by any other European airline, and we 
trust that with these new improved 5 year pay deals, we can maintain that successful record until at least 
2020."

Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
During the month, the Company's NAV rose by 3.5% and the share price increased
 by 4.3%. For reference, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index was up 5.0% during
 the period.
Following two months of market falls, European equities rose very strongly in
 October. This relief rally was initially caused by the Federal Reserve's
 decision to delay raising rates, which investors interpreted as a signal that
 central bank support may relieve some of the weaker data seen in emerging
 markets. This was followed up by the European Central Bank (ECB) hinting at
 further easing (potentially in December) and the People's Bank of China cutting
 its deposit rate. This rally also caused a significant rotation within the
 market with areas that had performed very poorly (such as commodity, energy and
 emerging market-related stocks) leading the rise. Indeed, autos, oil & gas and
 basic materials were the top three performing sectors in October, whereas
 sectors including health care and financials significantly underperformed the
 market. October also saw the start of third quarter earnings announcements for
 European companies, with the results broadly disappointing, especially in
 cyclical sectors such as consumer discretionary and industrials.
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
The Company's underperformance in October was largely due to stock selection;
 however, sector allocation also detracted illustrating the effect of the
 market's positioning-led rotation that took place towards the beginning of the
 month. The largest relative losses were realised from an underweight holding to
 consumer goods and an overweight to financials.
Amongst the top detractors to performance over the month were KBC Groep and
 Bank of Ireland, as domestic focused stocks underperformed their emerging
 market counterparts. Equally, the rhetoric coming from the central banks in
 both Europe and the US suggesting lower rates for longer, put increasing
 pressure on expectations for net interest income (the spread a bank earns
 between the deposits it takes and loans it makes) for the banking sector as a
 whole.
We also saw holdings in Novo Nordisk and Novartis detract as the market became
 more risk-on and many defensive names gave up some of their strong returns
 realised in the last quarter. In the same vein, not holding Nestlé contributed
 to relative performance over the month.
Despite its defensive nature, Heineken bucked the downward trend of these
 names, delivering strong performance during October. The company released Q3
 results with sales 4% ahead of expectations, largely driven by strong trade in
 Europe. The largest contributor to performance was Russian internet company
 Yandex which reported an 18% year-on-year increase in revenues for Q3.
At the end of the period, the Company had higher weightings when compared with
 the reference index to financials, technology, consumer services and
 industrials. The Company had lower exposure to consumer goods, basic materials,
 oil & gas, health care, utilities and telecoms.
Outlook
Despite the uncertainties and worries which have dominated the market since the
 summer, we remain constructive on European equities. With the likelihood of
 further incremental support from the ECB through expansion of the current
 Quantitative Easing programme, domestic growth should remain underpinned in our
 view. Recent positive European economic/sentiment indicators suggest that the
 European economy has a degree of resilience in the face of the increased
 concerns over a global slowdown, which is encouraging. We believe that the
 favourable credit conditions, subdued wage growth and weaker Euro can help
 boost economic momentum and in turn European corporate earnings together, with
 some additional profit margin normalisation. We remain of the view that the
 European equity universe offers undemanding valuation opportunities but stock
 selection remains a focus during this period of increased volatility and
 heightened uncertainty around the global economic growth outlook.

Ovda (Israel) from Budapest, Kaunas and Krakow.  We will deliver double digit growth in Ireland, UK, 
Spain, Italy, Portugal, Poland, Germany, and in Denmark where our Copenhagen operations (15 routes) will 
grow by over 100% to 2.5m customers p.a.
 This winter we take delivery of 28 new Boeing 737 aircraft which will take the fleet to 340 by year end, 
with another 330 on order. These aircraft will deliver with Boeing's new Sky interiors and slimline seats 
which will improve leg room and provide our passengers with an even more enjoyable on board experience.
 Improving "AGB" customer experience:
 The continuing success of our AGB programme is driving stronger forward bookings, higher load factors, 
and accelerating our traffic growth. Having raised our full year traffic target from 103m to 104m in Sept 
we are raising it again today to 105m which is 16% higher than last year's 90.6m. In the next 6 months 
customers will enjoy further improvements including our personalised website, new cabin crew uniforms, 
inflight menus, new Sky interiors, better seating and defibrillators fitted on all our aircraft.
 The early customer feedback on our new personalised website has been very positive. Customers are finding 
it easier and faster to book our lowest fares, select keenly priced ancillary services, and the volume of 
"My Ryanair" registrations is accelerating.  This new website will enable Ryanair to better understand our 
customers and better meet their travel needs with appropriate offers for hotels, car hire, restaurants 
venues and other services. Our new car hire partnership with CarTrawler has significantly improved car 
hire availability and service.
 The key element of Ryanair's AGB programme remains our relentless commitment to offer the lowest fares in 
every market, but with the best on-time performance. In H1, despite the impact of French ATC strikes, the 
fire closure of Terminal 3 in Rome (FCO) and record load factors, our on-time performance improved 2% 
points to 91% as follows:

 FY15    91%   89%   87%   86%   90%   90%   89%

 FY16    90%   92%   91%   90%   90%   92%   91%
 ------  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  -----
Fuel and US$ Hedging:
 We have taken advantage of occasional oil price weakness this summer to further extend our fuel hedges to 
95% cover for FY17 at an ave rate of $62 pbl. Having already hedged our US$ opex, we expect these hedges 
to deliver fuel savings of some EUR430m in FY17.  We plan to pass on these savings to our customers in the 
form of lower airfares particularly as we grow capacity quickly in major markets such as Belgium, Denmark, 
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the UK in 2016.
 Customers will also benefit from our successful US$ hedge programme. Our aircraft capex out to March 2018 
is fully hedged at an ave EUR/$ rate of 1.31 which means we will be adding these new Boeing 737-800NG 
aircraft to our balance sheet at lower euro prices than most of our existing fleet. This combination of 
lower aircraft and fuel costs will enable Ryanair to continue to lower fares and grow market share while 
extending our unit cost leadership over all airline competitors in every market we fly in Europe.
 Shareholder Returns & Balance Sheet:
 In August we completed a EUR400m share buyback and, following EGM approval in October, we will return the 
EUR398m proceeds from the sale of our Aer Lingus stake to shareholders in November.   When this is 
complete, we will have returned over EUR3.3bn to shareholders since 2008.  Ryanair's balance sheet 
continues to be one of the strongest in the industry.  Our net cash position increased by over EUR600m 
over the half year to EUR976m notwithstanding capex of EUR482m, share buybacks of EUR289m and debt 
repayments of EUR194m.
 Outlook:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report
 We continue to see significant growth opportunities for Ryanair's lower fares and AGB customer offering.  
We are have raised our FY16 traffic target from 104m to 105m customers due to higher load factors in H2 
with Q3 traffic set to grow 17% and Q4 by 22%.
 As forward pricing has softened in recent weeks we expect Q3 ave fares will be broadly flat against last 
year, but Q4 fares (with almost zero visibility) will fall by approx. 4%.  We expect unit costs to fall by 
5% in FY16, while ex-fuel unit costs will be down 1%.  Ancillary revenue, while ahead of our long term 
target of 20% of total revenue, will track behind this year's 16% increase in traffic due to a one-time 
benefit last year arising from the earlier loading of the S15 schedule and the absence of a car-hire 
partner in July and Aug.
 Accordingly, we now guide that full year net profit (pre-exceptions) will be towards the upper end of our 
EUR1,175m to EUR1,225m range.  However, we caution that this guidance is heavily dependent on the strength 
of close-in bookings in Q4 where we have almost zero visibility yet are planning to deliver 22% traffic 
growth. Looking beyond the current year, based on these stronger than expected load factors, we have 
raised our long term traffic target from 160m to 180m customers p.a. by FY24."

Ryanair Holdings plc
 Introduction
 For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") (with the exception of the balance 
sheet commentary below) all figures and comments are by reference to the adjusted results excluding the 
exceptional items referred to below.  A reconciliation of the results for the period under IFRS to the 
adjusted results is provided in note 9 of this half-yearly financial report.
 The exceptional item in the half-year ended September 30, 2015 comprised the gain of EUR317.5M arising on 
the disposal of Ryanair's 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus.
 Adjusted profit excluding the exceptional item increased by 37% to EUR1,088.2M in the half-year ended 
September 30, 2015.  Including the exceptional item the profit for the half-year amounted to EUR1,405.7M.
 Financial Review Half-Year Ended September 30, 2015
 Income Statement
 Scheduled revenues:
 Scheduled revenues rose by 16% to EUR3,240.0M due to 13% traffic growth to 58m and a 2% increase in 
average fare to EUR56.
 Ancillary revenues:
 Ancillary revenues rose by 8% to EUR800.1M due to 13% traffic growth, partially offset by a one-time 
benefit in the prior year comparative arising from the earlier loading of the Summer 15 schedules and the 
result of Hertz ending their car-hire partnership (on short notice) at the beginning of Jul-15.
 Operating Expenses:
 Fuel and oil:
 Fuel and oil fell by 1% to EUR1,157.0M due to lower euro fuel prices per gallon in the period.
 Airport and handling charges:
 Airport and handling charges rose by 15% to EUR469.6M due to 13% traffic growth, the addition of more 
primary airports to the network and stronger sterling against the euro.
 Route charges:
 Route charges increased by 11% to EUR349.4M due to a 7% increase in sectors flown and Eurocontrol price 
increases in France, Germany and the UK.
 Staff costs:
 Staff costs were up 15% to EUR305.7M due to a 7% increase in sectors flown, the impact of a 2% pay 
increase in Apr-15 and stronger sterling against the euro.
 Depreciation:
 Depreciation increased by 10% to EUR215.1M due to 21 additional aircraft (269 at Sep-15 v 248 at Sep-14), 
the purchase of 5 spare engines and higher levels of heavy maintenance activity.
 Marketing, distribution and other:
 Marketing, distribution and other rose by 20% to EUR149.0M, due mainly to costs related to the French ATC 
strike in Apr-15 (approx. EUR5M), accelerated spend (timing) of our marketing budget due to the opening up 
of new routes and bases and higher on-board sales.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs:
 Maintenance, materials and repairs decreased by 3% to EUR62.8M due to lower unscheduled maintenance than 
last year and positive currency hedging.
 Aircraft rentals:
 Aircraft rentals increased by 17% to EUR71.0M due to the longer duration of short-term summer leases 
compared to the prior year comparative.
 Unit costs excluding fuel remained flat, including fuel they fell by 6%.
 Other income/(expense)
 Gain on disposal of available for sale financial asset:
 The Group disposed of its 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus for EUR2.50 per share resulting in an 
exceptional gain of EUR317.5M primarily due to the reclassification of unrealised gains from other 
comprehensive income and reserves to the income statement. The investment had previously been impaired to 
EUR0.50 per share in prior periods.
 Finance expense:
 Finance expense fell by 8% to EUR34.8M due to lower interest rates.
 Finance income:
 Finance income rose by 9% to EUR14.0M primarily due to higher cash balances.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash rose by EUR400.8M to EUR5,196.7M since Mar-15.
 Gross debt fell by EUR210.9M to EUR4,220.7M in the period.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -5-
 EUR967.2M cash flow was generated by operating activities and the sale of our 29.8% shareholding in Aer 
Lingus generated EUR398.1M. This funded net capital expenditure of EUR482.2M, share buybacks of EUR288.8M 
and debt repayments of EUR194.3M.
 Net cash rose by EUR611.7M to EUR976.0M (Mar 31, 2015: EUR364.3M).
 Shareholders' equity
 Shareholders' equity increased by EUR494.7M to EUR4,529.8M in the period due to net profit after tax of 
EUR1,405.7M offset by a reclassification of EUR291.4M on disposal of the available for sale financial 
asset, EUR288.8M in share buy backs and IFRS accounting treatment for derivatives of EUR336.3M.
 Financial Review Quarter Ended September 30, 2015
 Introduction
 The exceptional item in the quarter ended September 30, 2015 comprised the gain of EUR317.5M arising on 
the disposal of Ryanair's 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus.
 Adjusted profit excluding the exceptional item increased by 41% to EUR843.1M in the quarter ended 
September 30, 2015.  Including the exceptional item the profit for the quarter amounted to EUR1,160.6M.
 Income Statement
 Scheduled revenues:
 Scheduled revenues rose by 19% to EUR1,991.9M due to 11% traffic growth to 30M and a 7% increase in 
average fare to EUR66.
 Ancillary revenues:
 Ancillary revenues rose by 7% to EUR395.5M due to 11% traffic growth, partially offset by a one-time 
benefit in the prior year comparative arising from the earlier loading of the Summer 15 schedules and the 
result of Hertz ending their car-hire partnership (on short notice) at the beginning of Jul-15.
 Operating Expenses:
 Fuel and oil:
 Fuel and oil fell by 2% to EUR597.0M due to lower euro fuel prices per gallon in the quarter.
 Airport and handling charges:
 Airport and handling charges rose by 12% to EUR237.9M due to 11% traffic growth, the addition of more 
primary airports to the network and stronger sterling against the euro.
 Route charges:
 Route charges increased by 10% to EUR177.5M due to a 7% increase in sectors flown and Eurocontrol price 
increases in France, Germany and the UK.
 Staff costs:
 Staff costs were up 16% to EUR153.9M due to a 7% increase in sectors flown, the impact of a 2% pay 
increase in Apr-15 and stronger sterling against the euro.
 Depreciation:
 Depreciation increased by 11% to EUR108.9M due to 21 additional aircraft (269 at Sep-15 v 248 at Sep-14), 
the purchase of 5 spare engines and higher levels of heavy maintenance activity.
 Marketing, distribution and other:
 Marketing distribution and other rose by 15% to EUR74.0M due to the accelerated spend (timing) of our 
marketing budget due to the opening of new routes and bases and higher on-board sales.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs:
 Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 5% to EUR31.1M due to the increased level of activity.
 Aircraft rentals:
 Aircraft rentals increased by 2% to EUR35.0M due to the longer duration of summer leases compared to the 
prior year comparative.
 Unit costs excluding fuel rose by 1%, including fuel they fell by 5%.
 Other income/(expense)
 Gain on disposal of available for sale financial asset:
 The Group disposed of its 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus for EUR2.50 per share resulting in an 
exceptional gain in the income statement of EUR317.5M primarily due to the reclassification of unrealised 
gains from other comprehensive income and reserves to the income statement. The investment had previously 
been impaired to EUR0.50 per share in prior periods.
 Finance expense:
 Finance expense fell by 7% to EUR17.5M due to lower interest rates.
 Finance income:
 Finance income dropped by 8% to EUR3.4M due to lower interest rates earned on cash deposits in the 
quarter.

and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and 
interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the 
general economic environment in Ireland, the UK, and Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to

 The exceptional item in the half-year ended September 30, 2015 relates to a one-off gain on disposal of 
our 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus (see note 8).
 Going concern
 After making enquiries and considering the Group's principal risks and uncertainties and its financial 
position and cash flows, the directors have formed a judgment, at the time of approving the interim 
financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the interim financial statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the interim financial statements.
 Ryanair Holdings plc
 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
 1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the six months ended September 30, 2015 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the interim financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2015 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2015, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2015, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2015 do not constitute statutory financial 
statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2015, together with the independent auditor's report 
thereon, have been filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual General 
Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website.  The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the interim 
financial statements for the six month period ended September 30, 2015 on October 30, 2015.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
 The following new and amended standards, that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB), and are effective under those standards for the first time for the current financial year 
beginning on or after January 1, 2015, and have also been endorsed by the EU, have been applied by the 
Group for the first time in these condensed consolidated financial statements;
 --      Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (Amendments to IAS 19) (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after July 1, 2014).*
 --      "Annual Improvements to IFRSs". 2010-2012 Cycle (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after July 1, 2014).*
 --      "Annual Improvements to IFRSs". 2011-2013 Cycle (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after July 1, 2014).
 * These standards or amendments to standards have been EU endorsed and have an effective date for periods 
beginning after February 1, 2015 or can be early adopted.
 The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations in the six month period ended September 30, 2015.
 Exceptional item The Group presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of their size 
and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we believe this presentation represents 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -6-
the underlying business more accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the 
results. Any amounts deemed exceptional for management discussion and analysis purposes have been 
classified for the purposes of the income statement in the same way as non-exceptional amounts of the same 
nature.
 The exceptional item in the half-year ended September 30, 2015 relates to a one-off gain on disposal of 
our 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus (see note 8).
 2.            Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made by 
management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were 
the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.            Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.            Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the half-year ended September 
30, 2015 was 12.2% (September 30, 2014: 12.4%).  The tax charge for the half-year ended September 30, 2015 
of EUR150.8M (September 30, 2014: EUR112.5M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR143.4M and a deferred 
tax charge of EUR7.4M relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment recognised 
in the income statement.
 5.            Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR4.7M is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.

Body
 At September 30, 2015 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 320 (2014: 299) Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.  The 
Group has agreed to purchase 183 new Boeing 737 800NG aircraft from the Boeing Corporation during the 
periods Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2019 of which 11 aircraft were delivered in the year ended March 31, 2015 
and a further 12 were delivered in the half-year ended September 30, 2015.
 The Group also agreed to purchase up to 200 (100 firm and 100 options) Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft from 
the Boeing Corporation during the periods Fiscal 2019 to Fiscal 2024.
 8.            Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 During the half-year ended September 30, 2015 the Group disposed of its 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus 
for EUR2.50 per share resulting in an exceptional gain in the income statement of EUR317.5M. The 
investment had previously been impaired to EUR0.50 per share in prior periods.
 9.            Analysis of operating segment
 The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car-hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Group 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided 
to the CEO, who is the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation 
decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation decisions are made 
based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in 
type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial 
results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the 
Group for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Group has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Group's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Group's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Group is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Group's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the half-year to September 30, 2015 amounted to EUR482.2M and primarily relates to 
aircraft pre delivery payments, 12 aircraft deliveries and 3 new spare engines.
 12.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
 We are exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. Our financial risk 
exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The 
Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -7-
 These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2015 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the period.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --           Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.
 --           Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
that asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --           Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --           Available for sale: The fair value of available for sale financial assets is their quoted 
market bid price at the balance sheet date. (Level 1)
 --           Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine 
the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --           Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of 
the contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at September 30, 
2015 has been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the half-year to September 30, 2015, 
there were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 12.          Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --           Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been 
discounted at the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at September 30, 
2015 to arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the period to 
September 30, 2015 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.

 We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed consolidated interim financial statements in the 
half-yearly financial report for the six month period ended September 30, 2015, which comprises the condensed 
consolidated interim balance sheet, the condensed consolidated interim income statement, the condensed 
consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, the condensed consolidated interim statement of cash 
flows, the condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in shareholder's equity set out on pages 4 to 10 
and the related explanatory notes on pages 17 to 24.
 We have read the other information contained in the half-year financial report and considered whether it contains 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed consolidated interim 
financial statements.
 This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the Company 
in meeting the requirements of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (the TD Regulations) 
and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the 
United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority.
 Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to it 
in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have 
reached.
 Directors' responsibilities
 The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the Directors. The Directors are 
responsible for preparing the half-yearly interim report in accordance with the TD Regulations and the Transparency 
Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom Financial 
Conduct Authority.
 As disclosed in note 1, the annual financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and as adopted by the European Union.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -9-
 The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the 
Group included in this half-yearly financial report have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 "Interim Financial 
Reporting" as adopted by the EU.
 Our responsibility
 Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the set of condensed consolidated interim financial 
statements in the half-yearly financial report, based on our review.
 Scope of review
 We conducted our review in accordance with the Financial Reporting Council's International Standard on Review 
Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor 
of the Entity. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible 
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially 
less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and 
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that 
might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
 Conclusion
 Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated 
interim financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six month period ended September 30, 2015 is 
not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the EU, and consequently IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, the TD Regulations and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland and the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority.

 TOTAL VOTING RIGHTS
 In conformity with Regulation 20 of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109 EC) Regulations 2007 (as amended), 
Ryanair announces that as at 28 October, 2015 immediately following the completion of the Capital Reorganisation 
implemented in connection with the Return of Cash announced on 24 September, 2015:
 Ryanair's issued share capital consists of 1,319,320,802 Ordinary Shares of nominal value EUR0.006 each with 
voting rights. Ryanair does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury.  Therefore, the total number of voting rights in 
Ryanair is 1,319,320,802.
 The above figure may be used by shareholders as a denominator for the calculations by which they will determine 
if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, Ryanair under the Transparency 
(Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (as amended) and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of

 The Return of Cash amounts to EUR0.2942 per Existing Ordinary Share and is being effected by means of a B 
Share scheme. This gives Shareholders (other than Restricted Shareholders and ADS Holders, all of whom will 
receive the B Share Dividend) a choice as to the form in which they receive their proceeds from the Return of Cash 
- redemption proceeds (the Redemption Option) or dividend income (the B Share Dividend).
 Shareholders (other than Restricted Shareholders and ADS Holders) who wish to receive the B Share Dividend 
must complete and return a valid Form of Election or submit a valid USE Instruction (as the case may be) prior to 
1.00 p.m. on 5 November, 2015.
 Shareholders (other than Restricted Shareholders and ADS Holders) who wish to receive their proceeds in the 
form of a redemption need take no further action as any eligible Shareholders who do not complete and return a 
Form of Election or submit a valid USE Instruction prior to 1.00 p.m. on 5 November, 2015 will be deemed to have 
elected for the Redemption Option.
 In order to try to maintain (subject to market fluctuations) the market price for Ordinary Shares at approximately the 
same level as immediately prior to the implementation of the Return of Cash, a Capital Reorganisation, entailing a 
Share Consolidation on the basis of 39 New Ordinary Shares for every 40 Existing Ordinary Shares, is being 
implemented.
 Application has been made to the Irish Stock Exchange and the UK Listing Authority for  1,319,320,802 ordinary 
shares of nominal value EUR0.006 in the capital of the Company (being the New Ordinary Shares in issue on 
completion of the Share Consolidation) to be admitted to the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and the Official 
List of the UK Listing Authority and application has been made to the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock 
Exchange for these New Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on the respective main markets for listed 
securities of the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.
 The New Ordinary Shares in issue on completion of the Share Consolidation will be equivalent in all material 
respects to the Existing Ordinary Shares, including as to dividend, voting and other rights.
 Admission is expected to be effective on 28 October, 2015 at 8.00 a.m. in accordance with the dates set out below.

Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
During the month, the Company's NAV fell by 2.3% and the share price decreased
 by 3.3%. For reference, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index was down 3.2% during
 the period.
European equity markets fell again in September. The market is down almost 11%
 since its peak in April. The market was led down by especially poor performance
 in banks, basic resources and autos as a combination of stock-specific issues
 (such as the news that Volkswagen had used a 'cheat' device on their diesel
 cars) and concerns over a slowdown in China dented sentiment. Weakness in basic
 resources was exacerbated by China's manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manager's
 Index) hitting a three-year low. Monetary policy remained loose in developed
 markets, with the Federal Reserve further delaying a potential rate hike and
 the European Central Bank continuing its Quantitative Easing programme. Despite
 concerns over Chinese growth, economic data for Europe remained steady as
 signalled by both Eurozone manufacturing PMI's and the German business
 confidence indicator.
Stock selection drove performance in September, with sector allocation
 marginally detracting. On a sector basis, the Company saw the greatest returns
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 through exposure to the technology and consumer services sectors. A lower
 exposure relative to the index in consumer goods detracted from returns, as
 investor capital flowed into this 'defensive' sector in response to global
 growth concerns.
Ryanair contributed strongly to returns as they raised their net income
 guidance for the full year by 25%. In addition, the share price responded
 positively to the news that the proceeds from the sale of Aer Lingus would be
 distributed to shareholders in the near term. Avoiding VW, which saw its share
 price plunge by over 40% in reaction to the company's emissions scandal, was
 also beneficial to relative performance.
Luxury names LVMH and Luxottica also contributed to performance, beginning to
 bounce back from a seemingly oversold position in August. Avoiding Banco
 Santander continued to benefit the Company. The share price fell as it
 experienced downgrades following a cautious tone on targets delivered at their
 investor day.
Not holding Nestlé, which makes up over 4% of the index, detracted from
 returns. The share price increased as investors fled to safety. Zurich
 Insurance was also a negative contributor to returns. Confidence in management
 was weakened when the decision to walk away from the RSA deal was announced.
 Additionally, some concerns surrounding the non-life business and losses
 sustained in this area have grown. We believe, however, that this stock
 continues to exhibit an attractive and secure dividend yield and has a strong
 capital position. Türkiye Halk Bankasi also detracted as heightened investor
 concerns around the implications of a US rate hike and domestic political
 uncertainty was reflected in the share price.
At the end of the period the Company had higher weightings when compared with
 the reference index to financials, technology, consumer services and
 industrials. The Company had lower exposure to consumer goods, basic materials,
 oil & gas, health care, utilities and telecoms.
Outlook
Despite the uncertainties and worries which have dominated the market since the
 summer, we remain constructive on European equities. Recent European leading
 indicators suggest that the European economy has a degree of resilience in the
 face of increased concerns over a global slowdown. The European Commission's
 Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI), Business Climate, Industrial Confidence and
 Services Confidence indicators have all showed signs of progress in September,
 defying expectations of a decline. For companies with more domestic exposure,
 European equity earnings momentum remains robust. The European Central Bank's
 programme of Quantitative Easing remains in place and is having a positive
 impact on the credit cycle and European GDP growth. Over the long term, we
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 continue to believe that the corporate earnings and cash generation of
 companies are the key drivers of equity returns.

Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "Ryanair's September traffic grew by 12% to 9.55m customers, while our load factor jumped 4% points to 94%. 
These record monthly numbers and load factors are due to our lower fares, our stronger forward bookings and the 
continuing success of our "Always Getting Better" customer experience programme, which continues to deliver 
stronger than expected traffic and load factors on our biggest ever summer schedule.
 Ryanair customers can now look forward to more service enhancements, as we continue Year 2 of our AGB 
programme, which include our new car hire service, a new website, new app, new cabin interiors, new crew 
uniforms, and improved inflight menus, as Ryanair continues to deliver so much more than just the lowest fares in 
Europe."

 Ryanair's issued share capital consists of 1,353,149,541 Ordinary Shares of nominal value EUR0.00635 each with

 Publication of Circular and Notice of Extraordinary General Meeting in respect of proposed Return of Cash
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, advises that it has today issued a Circular to Shareholders containing details of 
the proposed return to Shareholders of approximately EUR398 million, comprising the gross proceeds from the sale 
of its shares in Aer Lingus.  The Circular includes notice of an Extraordinary General Meeting (to be held in Dublin 
on 22 October, 2015) at which the Resolutions necessary for the implementation of the Return of Cash will be 
considered and voted on.
 The Return of Cash amounts to EUR0.2942 per Existing Ordinary Share and is being effected by means of a B 
Share scheme. This gives Shareholders (other than Restricted Shareholders and ADS Holders who will (subject to 
the passing of the Resolutions) receive the B Share Dividend) a choice as to the form in which they receive their 
proceeds from the Return of Cash - redemption proceeds (the Redemption Option) or dividend income (the B Share 
Dividend). Shareholders who are eligible to make an election but fail to do so will be deemed to have elected for the 
Redemption Option.
 In order to try to maintain (subject to market fluctuations) the market price for Ordinary Shares at approximately the 
same level as immediately prior to the implementation of the Return of Cash, a Capital Reorganisation, entailing a 
Share Consolidation on the basis of 39 New Ordinary Shares for every 40 Existing Ordinary Shares, is also being 
proposed.
 Further details of the Return of Cash and Capital Reorganisation is contained in the Circular.
 Document Availability
 Copies of the Circular and other documentation being issued in connection with the Return of Cash and Capital 
Reorganisation will be available on the Ryanair website at http://investor.ryanair.com/. Shareholder documentation 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of EGM

 RYANAIR TO DISTRIBUTE EUR398M AER LINGUS PROCEEDS TO SHAREHOLDERS
 BOARD APPROVES 'B' SHARE PROGRAMME (SUBJECT TO EGM APPROVAL)
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, held its AGM in Dublin this morning (24 Sep 2015), during which the airline 
briefed shareholders on the continuing success of its "Always Getting Better" (AGB) customer experience 
programme, which has enabled Ryanair to raise its full year traffic forecast (previously 103m) to 104m customers, 
and its profit guidance by 25%, (previously EUR970m) to EUR1.2bn.
 Ryanair briefed shareholders on further AGB improvements later this year, including new primary airports in 
Amsterdam, Cologne, and Copenhagen, a new personalised website with advanced features ('hold the fare'), an 
improved mobile app, new cabin interiors, crew uniforms and improved inflight menus.
 Ryanair's AGM also heard of plans to distribute the proceeds (EUR398m) from the sale of Ryanair's 29.8% stake in 
Aer Lingus, to its shareholders via a 'B' Share programme which will be concluded, subject to EGM approval, before 
December. This will bring the total funds returned by Ryanair to shareholders this year to EUR800m and in excess 
of EUR3.3bn since 2008.
 Ryanair Chairman David Bonderman said:
 "During our 30(th) year, Ryanair will grow traffic by over 13m to 104m customers. It is clear that consumers all over 
Europe are delighted by, and switching to our "AGB" customer experience programme, our industry leading 
punctuality and our unbeatable low fares. Ryanair's combination of low fares and AGB service continues to deliver 
for our customers, our people and our shareholders.
 Following the sale of our 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus, the Board intends to distribute the EUR398m proceeds to 
shareholders by way of a 'B' share programme.  We expect this programme will be completed - subject  to EGM 
approval - before the end of the calendar year. When completed we will have returned EUR800m to shareholders 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR TO DISTRIBUTE EUR398M TO SHAREHOLDERS
this year, and over EUR3.3bn over the last 7 years, in addition to more than doubling our share price over the last 
18 months."

Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
During the month, the Company's NAV fell by 4.7% and the share price decreased
 by 3.0%. For reference, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index was down 5.6% during
 the period.
In August, global equity markets fell sharply reflecting an extreme risk
 aversion. European indices recorded the worst monthly performance since August
 2011, with the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index falling by 5.6%. All major sectors
 declined during the month, with not much discrimination, but nevertheless with
 commodity related sectors performing the worst. The market sell-off was
 triggered by the fear of a sharp economic slowdown in China, with concerns
 about broader weakness in emerging markets Asia-Pacific. Markets also
 experienced higher levels of volatility in the month with the VIX hitting an
 intra-month high at approximately 40 having started the month around 12,
 reflecting the extent of the risk aversion that has built into the market in a
 short period of time.
Stock selection drove performance in August, with sector allocation marginally
 additive. On a sector basis, the Company saw the greatest returns through its
 lower exposure to basic materials, as the sector was hit especially hard as
 fears over China and emerging market growth prospects and market stability
 increased. A greater exposure to consumer services also proved beneficial.
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
Travel sector stocks Ryanair and Tui contributed to returns over the month. The
 latter experienced a solid beat on earnings and improved estimates on earnings
 growth. Primarily, this was driven by the hotels and cruise divisions as well
 as strong tour operator numbers in the UK and Nordics. As uncertainty over the
 Greek political situation subsided, the company also reported a recovery in
 Greek holiday bookings.
The Company also realised a positive return from a holding in implant and
 restorative dentistry business Straumann. The company's results illustrated
 solid organic growth driven by demand in Europe with earnings numbers also
 ahead of consensus. Pandora also released results 4% ahead of consensus and saw
 resultant upgrades. We continue to believe the stock is a high quality
 compounder offering the potential of attractive cash returns to investors.
Holdings within the luxury sector detracted from performance as stocks with
 perceived exposures to China sold off following the decision of the People's
 Bank of China to devalue the currency. LVMH Moët Hennessy, for example, fell by
 over 10% during the month. Likewise, Pernod Ricard detracted from performance,
 suffering also from poor sales in the US as consumer taste trends prove to be
 shifting away from vodka and towards bourbon, causing the company to experience
 subsequent downgrades. Unilever also detracted as it was sold off with emerging
 market exposed stocks.
At the end of the period the Company had higher weightings when compared with
 the reference index to financials, technology, consumer services and
 industrials. The Company had lower exposures to consumer goods, basic
 materials, oil & gas, health care, utilities and telecoms.
Outlook
Despite the performance of European equities year-to-date and recent market
 volatility, we continue to favour European equities given that macroeconomic
 momentum remains positive and monetary policies remain supportive. The recent
 correction has made investors somewhat fearful, even of equities with limited
 or zero exposure to China. At the same time, some specific equities with
 emerging market exposure have been marked down extremely aggressively and are
 in oversold territory in our view. For companies with more domestic exposure,
 European equity earnings momentum remains robust.

 RYANAIR RAISES FULL YEAR PROFIT GUIDANCE BY 25%
 TO RANGE OF EUR1,175M TO EUR1,225M AS "ALWAYS GETTING BETTER"
 PROGRAMME DELIVERS STRONGER TRAFFIC AND FARES.
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (9 Sept) issued a trading statement raising its full year Net 
Profit guidance by 25% from a current range of EUR940m to EUR970m to a new range of EUR1.175bn to 
EUR1.225bn due to stronger than expected peak summer traffic and prices as its "Always Getting Better" 
(AGB) customer experience programme continues to win millions of new customers at slightly higher than 
expected air fares.
 Ryanair had originally planned to update shareholders on current trading at its 24 Sept AGM, however the 
strength of its July and August numbers is continuing into September and the scale of the upgrade (40% up 
on prior year) requires this update to be brought forward.  The main drivers for this improved guidance 
are:-
 --    H1 traffic growth of 13% (previously guided 10%).
 --    H1 fares up over 2% (previously guided flat).
 --    Q3 traffic growth of 15% expected (previously guided 13%).
 --    Q3 fares now expected to be flat (previously guided -4% to -8%).
 --    FY16 traffic increased to 104m (previously 103m).
 --    Lower than expected prices for unhedged fuel in FY16 (10% of volume).
 Ryanair cautioned that its full year result remains heavily dependent on close-in bookings in Q3 
(currently 30% sold) and Q4 (currently zero visibility).  Ryanair continues to expect downward pressure on 
fares and yields this winter as it grows strongly in major EU markets such as Germany, at a time when 
competitors will begin to benefit from lower oil prices as historic hedges unwind.
 Ryanair also confirmed that it has successfully recovered all of the funds (less than $5m) that were the 
subject of a fraudulent electronic transfer to a Chinese bank in April.  As previously noted, steps have 
been put in place to ensure that such a transfer cannot recur.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "We have been surprised by the strength of close-in bookings and fares this summer during which we 
delivered record 95% load factors in both July and August while fares grew by over 2%, when we had 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR RAISES FULL YEAR PROFIT GUIDANCE BY 25%
expected them to be flat.  During a year when Ryanair will grow traffic by more than 13m customers p.a. 
it's clear that consumers all over Europe are delighted by and are switching to, our "Always Getting 
Better" (AGB) customer experience programme, our industry leading punctuality and our unbeatable low 
fares.
 We would caution that not all of this improvement is due to either our model or our management.  As a 
"load factor active/yield passive" airline we have clearly benefited from favourable industry trends this 
summer including bad weather in Northern Europe, stronger sterling encouraging more UK families to holiday 
in the Med, reasonably flat capacity across the EU industry and lower prices for our unhedged oil.  Being 
the airline industry we do not expect these favourable conditions will persist, and we would urge 
shareholders and analysts to avoid irrational exuberance while we continue to execute our very ambitious 
growth plans during what we expect to be very attritional and sustained fare wars across Europe this 
winter".
 Ryanair will hold an investor briefing call at 9.30am (London time) this morning.

Ryanair is Europe's favourite airline, operating more than 1,600 daily flights from 73 bases, connecting 194 
destinations in 31 countries and operating a fleet of more than 300 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Ryanair has 
recently announced firm orders for a further 283 new Boeing 737 aircraft, as well as options for 100 more Boeing 
737 MAX 200s, which will enable Ryanair to lower fares and grow traffic from 104m this year to 160m p.a. in 2024. 
Ryanair currently has a team of more than 9,500 highly skilled aviation professionals, and has an industry leading 
30-year safety record.
 Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, weather related 
disruptions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, 
the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK and 
Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political 
factors.

 rating of 4 times EBITDA fails to reflect the intrinsic value of the operating
 business.  Additional value from the GPG legacy cash could be unlocked after a
 reasonable settlement or successful litigation is achieved.
Dart Group plc ("Dart")
Dart Group is the parent company of the leisure airline Jet2 and the
 distributor Fowler Welch.  The original business was purchased in 1983 by
 Philip Meeson as an airfreight distributor from the Channel Islands to the UK
 specialising in flowers.  He remains the executive chairman and largest
 shareholder with 38 per cent of the equity and listed the company as Dart Group
 in 1991.  From its past, Dart retains some legacy airfreight contracts with
 Royal Mail and a distribution business, yet the business has completely
 transformed itself.  It now generates 88 per cent of its GBP1.2 billion sales and
 93 per cent of its GBP50.6 million operating profits from leisure travel.  The
 balance comes from Fowler Welch, a distributor of fresh produce for grocers,
 which was purchased in 1994.
Dart's airline, Jet2, is a low cost operator launched in 2003.  It operates all
 its flights from the north of England, Scotland and Ulster to mid to long
 distance European leisure destinations.  It has highly seasonal schedules, with
 peak weekly July capacity being nine times its lowest weekly schedule.  Since
 2004, Jet2 has increased seat capacity by 16 per cent per annum on average,
 from 1.2 million to 6 million in 2015, adding more planes and departures and
Crystal Amber Fund Limited Final Results -5-
 using larger planes.  Around half of its UK flights go to Spain, followed by
 Portugal, Italy and Turkey.
The business model is distinct from other low cost airlines.  Whereas most
 focus on purchasing new fuel efficient aircraft, Jet2 has bought inexpensive
 but fuel inefficient second hand planes.  Many competitors fund their fleet
 with operating leases; for example all Monarch's fleet is leased.  In contrast,
 Jet2 has grown its 59 strong fleet mostly by purchase, and now owns 44
 aircraft.  The average age of Jet2's fleet is nearly 22 years, versus Ryanair's
 5 years. Given its fuel inefficiency, Dart prudently starts each year with
 about 99 per cent of its requirements hedged.  However, the fuel inefficiency
 of the fleet is a challenge when oil prices are high and a considerable
 tailwind at current prices.  Dart's balance sheet is strong, with net tangible
 assets of GBP150.4 million.
Since 2007, Dart has developed Jet2Holidays, a packaged holiday business that
 supports and feeds off the airline, as it only uses Jet2's aircraft.  It has
 grown to carry one million passengers in the year to March 2015, or 33 per cent
 of Jet2's capacity.  The company's stated goal is to reach 50 per cent of its
 capacity.  The two businesses, airline and packaged holiday, are fully
 integrated, so that pricing on both can be managed to optimise yields.  The
 packaged holiday strategy affords the opportunity to earn additional profits
 from passengers, and more importantly grows a revenue stream that is not as
 subject to naked price comparison as airfares.
Over the last five years, Jet2 has grown its capacity from four million to six
 million seats and this growth has remained demand led, with load factors
 increasing from 85 per cent to 91 per cent in 2015.  To generate repeat sales,
 Dart has invested heavily in customer service.  It has 170 of its own
 representatives at destinations to look after customers, and the own-managed
 call centre targets 180 seconds maximum to answer calls.  Repeat sales stand at
 30 per cent of customers who purchased a holiday in the previous 13 months and
 40 percent on a 25 months view.  This investment in packaged holidays has come
 at the expense of margin, which over five years has fallen from 6 to 4.3 per
 cent, despite increasing ticket yields by an estimated 50 per cent.  However,
 as the number of holiday customers grows without adding destinations,
 operational gearing is expected to kick in.  After years of marketing
 investment of over GBP30 million per annum, brand recognition of the holiday
 business in its core market is slowly improving at 17 per cent from 10 per cent
 a year ago.  This remains low relative to the 45 per cent recognition of the
 Jet2 airline.
Results for the 2015 financial year were accompanied by a 17 per cent upgrade
 to next year's earnings forecast.  Advance bookings are 20 per cent ahead of
 last year's.  The upgrade came despite guiding to broadly flat airline capacity
Crystal Amber Fund Limited Final Results -5-
 for the year and so was mainly a result of additional capacity being taken up
 by the holiday product.  To reach the expected 40 per cent of seats taken by
 packaged holidays, Dart would have to sell around 200,000 more holidays.  Given
 the age of its fleet, Dart is expected to be one of the main beneficiaries from
 lower oil prices, and a lower Euro exchange rate.  The average hedged price per
 fuel barely fell for the 2015 fiscal year, to $922 per tonne from $961 the year
 before.  In our view, Dart will start reaping the benefits from lower oil
 prices in the current year.
Fowler Welch, the distribution business, has had a mixed performance, with
 pricing pressure from its large grocer customers negating efficiency
 improvements.  Its GBP152 million of revenues contribute a modest GBP3.7 million of
 operating profit.  In the past, the tangible nature of distribution assets
 contributed to the balance sheet strength of Dart during the growth of the
 airline, a business not normally liked by lenders.  In our opinion, the
 distribution business could now benefit from the increased scale that another
 trade owner could bring.
In our view, Dart's earnings momentum remains under-appreciated by the market.
 Given the low risk nature of the balance sheet, the growth delivered by Dart
 deserves a premium to its current 13 times earnings rating. We look forward to
 engaging with the management of Dart going forward.
Balfour Beatty plc ("Balfour Beatty")
Balfour Beatty finances, develops, builds and maintains complex infrastructure
 such as transportation, power and utility systems, and social and commercial
 buildings.  It reports its results under three headings - Construction
 Services, Support Services (maintenance type activities) and Infrastructure
 Investment, which are essentially public-private partnerships ("PPP's").
 Approximately 49% of its sales are in the UK, 36% in the US, and the remainder
 in the Middle and Far East.
The company has been in a state of turmoil for some time now with three profit
 warnings in 2014 and another in July 2015 as the profitability of contracts
 have been constantly revisited to show ever larger expected losses.  The 2014
 results showed a GBP58m operating loss down from a GBP146m profit in the previous
 year but despite several reviews of the ongoing contracts this has not been the
 end of the downgrades and further legacy problems were uncovered and announced
 with a GBP120m to GBP150m profit warning in July 2015.
The management team has seen a comprehensive overhaul with a new CEO and CFO
 appointed in 2015 and three new non-executive directors including the chairman
 since the start of 2015. At the end of March the new CEO set out his main
 strategic priorities under the label "Build to Last".  The plan primarily
 concerns protecting the balance sheet and as part of this dividend payments and
Crystal Amber Fund Limited Final Results -5-
 share buy backs have been suspended.  The plan also involves tighter working
 capital controls.  At an operating level he is focussing on reducing costs by
 improving procurement and work processes and shrinking central functions.  Key
 to this is the tendering for contracts at profitable rates and disciplined
 execution.  The strategy is ongoing and likely to be refined.  The recovery
 process is likely to take several years to implement and bring to fruition.
We believe there is considerable upside in the valuation to reflect the fact
 that the GBP1.3bn valuation of PPP's alone virtually matches the value of the
 company after netting off debt and pension deficits.  Support to this view has
 been provided by the sale of a number of PPP assets which have been sold at
 values that are consistent with those in the books; also an unsolicited bid for
 Balfour Beatty's PPP portfolio was rejected by the board.
The other activities of Construction Services and Support Services are
 therefore valued at virtually nothing.  We believe there is attractive
 potential for profit recovery on GBP7.86bn revenues  from these two divisions
 that made a GBP159m operating loss in 2015 compared to GBP262m profit five years
 earlier.
The most recent news from the company in July provided some indication that the
 balance sheet protection measures were being effective and that net cash at the
 end of June was substantially higher than a year earlier.
4imprint plc ("4imprint")
4imprint is an international direct marketer of promotional products, such as
 client-branded stationery or coffee cups, which it supplies and distributes.
 It generates 96 per cent of its revenues ($416 million in 2014) in the US and
 Canada, with the rest coming from the UK and Ireland. As 4imprint does not
 produce or hold the inventory, it is in some ways similar to marketing
 platforms such as eBay or Amazon Marketplace, putting customers in contact with
 suppliers.  Its key assets are its customer database and the analytics it has
 developed to optimise customer recruitment and retention.  In 2014 it processed
 more than 780,000 orders, covering millions of items, and in the first half of
 2015 it received more than 450,000.  No single customer accounted for more than
 one per cent of sales.
It is cheaper to retain customers than to acquire new ones.  Customer
 re-ordering within a 24-month period remains stable at 44 per cent, whereas new
 customer conversion from catalogue mailings is 1 per cent.  Growth of customer
 numbers is largely a function of marketing spend to acquire customers, posing a
 trade-off to management.  Pressing the growth accelerator reduces profits, as

In Dublin, Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "After a record summer 2015, where we grew our traffic and load factor and improved our industry leading 
punctuality, Ryanair is pleased to launch our Dublin summer 2016 schedule, which includes a new 4 times daily 
service to Amsterdam (our newest airport) and extra flights on 14 other routes, with 83 routes in total, which will 
deliver 11.75 million customers p.a at Dublin Airport, as we grow by 15% at Dublin.
 Irish customers and visitors continue to choose Ryanair for the lowest fares and biggest route network, while 
enjoying our ongoing "Always Getting Better" customer experience improvements. After introducing allocated 
seating, a second free carry-on bag allowance, Family Extra and Business Plus services, and reducing our fees in 
Year 1, we've continued to roll out Year 2 of our AGB programme, which has seen included new native apps, 
reduced sports and airport fees and the launch of Ryanair Car Hire, which went live on Ryanair.com yesterday.
 Our 103m customers can look forward to further improvements in the coming months, including our ground 
breaking personalised website, with exciting new digital features such as 'hold the fare' and real customer 
destination reviews, and improved menus, new cabin crew uniforms and new cabin interiors on board, with more to 
come in Year 3, as we continue to offer so much more than just lowest fares.
 To celebrate the launch of our Dublin summer 2016 schedule, and latest AGB improvements, we are releasing 
100,000 seats for sale across our European network, which are available for booking until midnight (7 Sep). Since 
these amazing low prices will be snapped up quickly, customers should log onto www.ryanair.com and avoid 
missing out."
 Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Paschal Donohoe said:
 "The growth at Dublin Airport outlined here today by Ryanair is good news for customers, who now have greater 
choice; for job creation, which will grow as a result, and for Irish aviation, which is going from strength to strength. 
The addition of a new route to Amsterdam from winter 2015 and additional capacity on another14 routes further 
strengthens Ryanair's position across Europe and facilitates the growth of tourism here at home'.
 "The numerous measures introduced by the company over the last year through its Always Getting Better 
programme have been warmly welcomed by Ryanair customers. The continued roll-out of the programme across 
this year and next is designed to make it even easier for people to secure bookings at favourable prices, making 
Ryanair an even more attractive option in the future. The National Aviation policy, which I published last month, 
outlines the need to ensure competitive air access and connectivity for Ireland, while responding to consumers' 
needs. Ryanair's is central to that. I commend all the staff on their success to date and look forward to their 
continued growth into the future."

or other professional adviser immediately (being, in the case of United Kingdom shareholders, an 
independent financial advisor authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 of the United 
Kingdom and, in the case of Irish shareholders, an organisation or firm authorised or exempted under the 
European Communities (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2007 of Ireland or the Investment 
Intermediaries Act 1995 (as amended) of Ireland.
 If you have sold or transferred all of your Ordinary Shares in Ryanair Holdings plc, please send this 
Notice together with the accompanying documents to the purchaser or transferee or to the stockbroker, bank

 A letter from the Chairman to Shareholders regarding the Annual General Meeting of Ryanair Holdings plc, 
to be held in the Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport, Co. Dublin, Ireland on September 24, 2015 at 9.00 
a.m. is set out on pages 1 to 3 of this document. The Notice of the Meeting is set out on pages 4 to 7 of 
this document.
 LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
 OF RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC
 Dear Shareholder,
 I am pleased to inform you that the Annual Report and Financial Statements for Ryanair Holdings plc for 
the year ended March 31, 2015, are now available on our website www.ryanair.com. You will find the Notice 
of the Annual General Meeting set out on pages 4 to 7 of this document. The Annual General Meeting will be 
held on September 24, 2015 at 9.00 a.m. in the Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport, Co. Dublin, Ireland.
 Action to be taken
 Proxy Form
 You will find enclosed a Form of Proxy and Attendance Card for the Annual General Meeting.  Whether or 
not you wish to attend the Annual General Meeting you should complete and sign the Form of Proxy and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of AGM
return it by no later than 9.00 a.m. on September 22, 2015 to Capita Asset Services, Shareholder solutions 
(Ireland), P.O. Box 7117, Dublin 2, Ireland (Please see notes 4 and 5 attached). Completion and return of 
the Form of Proxy will not preclude you from attending and voting at the Annual General Meeting, should 
you wish to do so. If you wish to attend the Annual General Meeting in person please bring your Attendance 
Card with you. If you appoint a person other than the Chairman or any other officer of Ryanair Holdings 
plc as your proxy, please give your Attendance Card to that person for his/her admission to the Meeting.
 Business to be considered at the Annual General Meeting
 Your attention is drawn to the Notice of Meeting on pages 4 to 7, which sets out matters to be considered 
at the Annual General Meeting. The ordinary business to be transacted at the Annual General Meeting is set 
out in resolutions 1 to 4 in the Notice.
 Under Resolution 1, shareholders are being asked to receive and consider the accounts for the year ended 
March 31, 2015 and the reports of the Directors and Auditors thereon.
 Under Resolution 2, shareholders are being asked to consider the Remuneration Report contained in 
Ryanair's Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2015. This advisory and non-binding resolution is 
often referred to as a "say on pay" resolution. While it is not mandatory for companies to put such a 
resolution to shareholders, it is best practice and Ryanair is committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance.
 Resolution 3 deals with the re-election of Directors. The Company's Articles of Association require that 
at least one third of the Directors shall retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting every year. 
However, in compliance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors will 
retire and present themselves for re-election by the shareholders, with the exception of Michael Horgan 
who, having served as Director for over 14 years, retires this year and does not offer himself for 
reelection. Biographical details of the Directors are found on pages 114 and 115 of the 2015 Annual 
Report. In addition shareholders are being asked to approve the election of Howard Millar and John Leahy 
as Directors. Howard Millar served as Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer from 
2003 until he retired in December 2014. Captain John Leahy had been a pilot at British Airways for 35 
years.  He retired in 2003 from the position of Chief Pilot on B-747.
 Resolution 4 deals with the authority of the Directors to fix the remuneration of the auditors.
 Special Business
 In addition to the ordinary business there is the following special business:
 Resolution 5 - Directors' Authority to Allot Ordinary Shares
 The Directors are seeking to renew their authority to allot shares in the authorised but unissued share 
capital of the Company for the period up to September 23, 2020.
 Resolution 6 - Disapplication of Statutory Pre-emption Rights
 As was the case at previous years' Annual General Meetings, the Directors are seeking authority to allot 
Ordinary Shares without first offering them to existing shareholders in accordance with statutory pre-
emption rights where the Ordinary Shares are allotted:
 (a)          On the exercise of any option in accordance with the provisions of the existing Ryanair 
Holdings plc Share Option Plan of 2013;
 (b)          In connection with a rights issue; and
 (c)          Otherwise than in pursuance of (a) and (b) above, up to an aggregate nominal value of the 
greater of EUR429,625 or  5% of the then issued share capital of the Company.
 It is proposed to renew this authority for the period expiring fifteen months from the passing of this 
Resolution or, if earlier, on the day following the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.
 Resolution 7 - Authority to Repurchase Shares
 The Directors are seeking the authority to make market purchases and/or overseas market purchases (as 
defined by Section 1072 of the Companies Act, 2014) of the Company's Ordinary Shares and American 
Depositary Shares (ADSs).   Any ADSs repurchased will be converted to Ordinary Shares and cancelled as 
will Ordinary Shares repurchased, and the number of Ordinary Shares in issue will reduce accordingly.
 The maximum price at which Ordinary Shares traded on the Irish Stock Exchange or the London Stock 
Exchange could be repurchased would be the higher of (i) 5% above the average market value of the 
Company's Ordinary Shares on the trading venue where the shares are being repurchased for the five 
business days prior to the date of purchase; and (ii) the price stipulated by Article 5(1) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) of December 22, 2003 (No. 2273/2003), being the higher of the last independent trade and 
the highest current independent bid on the trading venue on which the shares are being repurchased. It is 
further proposed that the maximum price at which Ordinary Shares which underlie the Company's ADSs which 
are traded on NASDAQ could be repurchased would be 5% above the average market value of one-fifth of the 
Company's ADSs on NASDAQ for the five business days prior to the date of purchase (as one ADS represents 
five Ordinary Shares).
 The minimum price at which Ordinary Shares could be repurchased would be their nominal value of 0.635 
euro cents (EUR0.00635). The authority will also enable the Company to repurchase in US dollars or euro.
 Resolutions 8 and 9 - Companies Act 2014
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of AGM
 There are two further Special Resolutions, the purpose of which is to take account of the changes to 
company law brought about by the Companies Act 2014, which was commenced for most purposes on 1 June 2015. 
The proposed Resolutions will amend the Memorandum of Association and adopt revised Articles of 
Association to take account of the consolidation and amendment of company law effected by the Companies 
Act 2014, and to make some consequential and housekeeping changes. A summary of the amendments which are 
proposed to be made to the Memorandum and Articles of Association is set out in an Appendix immediately 
following the attached AGM Notice.
 A copy of the Memorandum and Articles of Association as proposed to be amended by the Resolutions (if 
passed) is available on            www.ryanair.com and a copy will also be available for inspection at the 
registered office of the Company during normal business hours Monday to Friday (excluding public holiday) 
from the date of this notice up to and including the date of the AGM, and at the Radisson Blu Hotel, 
Dublin Airport, Co. Dublin, Ireland immediately before and during the Annual General Meeting.
 Recommendation of Directors
 The Directors believe that the passing of the Resolutions set out in the Notice of Meeting is in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and the Directors unanimously recommend that you 
vote in favour of such Resolutions as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings in 
Ordinary Shares which, as at the date of this letter, represent approximately 4.5% of the issued share 
capital of the Company.
 Yours sincerely,
 David Bonderman
 Chairman
 NOTICE OF AN ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF
 RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC

 APPENDIX
 Explanation of proposed amendments to the Memorandum and Articles of Association
 Appendix
 The Companies Act 2014 was commenced on June 1, 2015 and represents a consolidation and modernisation of 
Irish company law.
 Special Resolutions 8 and 9, if passed, will amend the Memorandum of Association and adopt revised 
Articles of Association in which statutory references and certain other concepts referenced within the 
Memorandum and Articles of Association will be updated to reflect the new legislation.  They will also 
selectively disapply certain provisions of the Companies Act 2014 in order to avoid unintended changes to 
the Company's constitutional documents as they stood immediately prior to the commencement of that Act.
 All of the changes described below are intended either to preserve the status quo or to ensure that 
statutory references and/or certain terminology are accurate.  As such the Board does not consider it 
necessary for the members to vote separately on each amendment to the Memorandum and Articles of 
Association.
 1.     Special Resolution 8
 This special resolution is being proposed in order to update the statutory references in Clauses 2 and 
3.15 of the Memorandum of Association so as to be consistent with the new Companies Act 2014, and to 
attend to a typographical inaccuracy at Clause 5.
 2.     Special Resolution 9
 Under this resolution, it is proposed to make the following amendments to the Articles of Association:
 a)     Articles 1, 7, 41(B), 53(f), 68(h)(ii), 85 and 95 contain references to sections in the companies 
legislation that was repealed on June 1, 2015. This resolution will amend these statutory references in 
order to ensure that they are consistent with the corresponding provisions in the Companies Act 2014.
 b)    The Companies Act 2014 adopts a new approach with respect to the constitution of every company.  
Instead of making provision for an optional model set of articles of association as was done with Table A 
of the First Schedule of the Companies Act 1963 ("Table A"), the Companies Act 2014 now contains specific 
sections which apply to all companies by default unless the articles of association of a company 
specifically exclude them. As many of these default provisions deal with matters which are already 
provided for in the Company's existing Articles of Association (which also disapply the model set of 
articles of association in Table A), it is necessary to include a new provision in the opening clause of 
the revised Articles of Association which disapplies certain optional sections of the Companies Act 2014. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of AGM -3-
As Table A is no longer relevant, it is no longer necessary to disapply it in Article 1. A summary of each 
of the provisions which are specifically excluded by the proposed new Article 1 is set out below:
 (i)            Section 43(2) deals with use of the company's seal. This section is being disapplied as 
equivalent, but more detailed provisions for use of the Company's seal are made in Articles 107 to 109;
 (ii)           Sections 65(2) to 65(7) deal with the power of a company to convert shares into stock and

These sections are being disapplied as the matters are already provided for in Articles 77 and 79.
 (c)   In  various  places  in  the  Articles  of  Association,  the  expression  "undenominated capital" 
is being inserted as this expression is now used in the Companies Act 2014 to refer to that part of a 
Company's issued share capital which is not represented by the nominal value paid up on the issued shares.
 (d)   Articles 11 and 34 are being amended to make clear that shares may be held and dealt with in 
uncertificated form.
 (e)   Article 38 is being supplemented to make clear that, despite the provision in Section 95(2)(a), 
directors are not to charge a fee when registering the transfer of a share.
 (f)    Article 53 subsections (b) and (f) are being amended to reflect the requirements under the 
Companies Act 2014 for notices convening a general meeting and the right of members to put items on the 
agenda of a general meeting.
 (g)   Article 55 is being amended in order to ensure that it will be consistent with Section 186 which 
specifies  what constitutes the ordinary business of the Company's annual general meeting.

the demand for a poll may be withdrawn without the consent of the Chairman.
 (i)    Article  74  is  being  amended  as  the  Companies  Act  2014  does  not  enable disapplication  
or amendment  of  the  time  period  stipulated  in  Section  183(10). Section 183(10) allows such notice 
to be effective if received at the registered office of a company at any time before the commencement of 
the meeting (or adjourned meeting) at which the proxy is used.
 (j)    Section  228(1)(d) is  a new provision restricting  the  use  of  company property by directors. A 
new Article 79(b) is therefore being adopted in order to ensure that directors can continue to use company 
property in accordance with the Company's fair usage policies and their terms and conditions of 
employment.
 (k)   Sections 228(1)(e) and 228(2) are also new, in that they codify for the first time the fiduciary 
duties of directors.  It is proposed in that context to include a new Article 97(d) in order to make it 
clear that Section  228(1)(e) (which prohibits a director from agreeing to restrict his power to exercise 
an independent judgement) will not restrict anything  which  may  be  done  by  any  director  in  
accordance  with  the  prior authorisation of the board or a board committee.  In addition, the new 
article prohibits any individual director from entering into any commitment which might otherwise be 
permitted by Section 228(2) without the prior approval of the board or a committee of the board.
 (l)   Article 121 has been amended in order to take account of the new requirements regarding the 
maintenance of  accounting records set out in Chapter 2 of Part 6 of the Act.  In Article 121 the 
directors may use the power provided for in the Act to send shareholders summary financial statements in 
lieu of the full statutory financial statements of the Company.  However, where the directors elect to do 
so, any shareholder may request a  full copy of the financial statements of the Company to be sent to him 
or her.
 (m)  A number of additional changes are provided for in the revised Articles of Association to conform 
the Articles to the new legislative regime, including:
 (i)             inclusion of the definition of "1996 Regulations" in Article 1(b);
 (ii)           amendment of the definition of "Stock Exchange Nominee" in Article 1(b);
 (iii)          updating references to reflect the relevant applicable legislation in the definition of 
"Licence" in Article 41(B);
 (iv)          amendment of Article 63 to reflect that votes of corporate Members may be given by duly 
authorised representative;
 (v)           amendment of Article 70 to provide that the appointment of a proxy may be executed by power 
of attorney;
 (vi)          amendment of Article 71 for clarificatory purposes to include the words "or a proxy for a 
Member";
 (vii)         amendment of Article 72 to provide that the appointment of a proxy or power of attorney or 
other authority under which it is executed shall be delivered at the Office of the Company or an 
electronic address provided for the purpose;

 (viii)        deletion of the words "cable, telegram, telex" in Article 80 as these forms of

Acts in the same manner as under the Companies Acts 1963-2013;
 (x)            deletion of references to "Irish pounds" and replacement therefor with the word "Euro" in

 (xi)           inclusion the words "or the Acts" in Article 112;
 (xii)          deletion of the word "lunacy" and replacement therefor with the word "incapacity" in 
Article 126(e), as "lunacy" is no longer a recognised concept in company law;
 (xiii)         amendment of Article 127 to reflect the provisions of the Act regarding service of notice 
of a general meeting;
 (xiv)        amendment of Article 130 to confirm that written notices may be given by the Company in

 In the period under review, your Company enjoyed strong contributions from house builders Crest Nicolson and 
Galliford Try, who both benefitted from strong demand in the face of limited supply. International packaging group 
Mondi rose on gains due to improved efficiency in its plants, some profitable investments and a stronger pricing 
environment. Underwriters such as esure and Direct Line rose in anticipation of an upturn in the motor insurance 
pricing cycle. These companies, along with airlines International Consolidated Airlines and Ryanair, have all 
demonstrated a capacity discipline that has enabled them to achieve pricing power and in several cases reward 
shareholders with special dividends.
 Construction company CRH continued to benefit from strong trading while the acquisition of assets from Lafarge-
Holcim at the bottom of the cycle should help drive growth further, as many of CRH's end markets are at an early 
stage in recovery. Our media holdings in ITV and WPP benefitted from a boost in advertising spend on the back of 
a recovering economy. Other areas of strength came from computer software companies such as Playtech (a key 
B2B partner providing the IT platform for European-based online gambling operators and currency trading 
operators) and Micro Focus International (software to improve companies' own systems). Your company also 
benefitted from a tailwind arising from its participation in a number of IPOs including Autotrader, fund administrator 
Sanne Group and Ranger Direct Lending Fund. The latter targets a yield of around 10per cent from short-term 
loans to US SMEs, an area underserved by mainstream banks.
 Set against this, there were lacklustre performances from some high-yielding blue chip companies (AstraZeneca, 
GlaxoSmithKline, British American Tobacco) for reasons described above, while shares in BP and Royal Dutch 
Shell suffered from the low oil price arising from Saudi Arabia's attempt to crush US shale frackers.
 There was one stock disappointment when shares in Plus 500 fell sharply after it was obliged to suspend UK 
customer trading accounts pending stricter anti-money laundering controls; we sold our entire holding and 
subsequently added to Playtech after it made an opportunistic bid for the online CFD trader. That said, we did make 
around three times our initial investment. Assuming the bid completes as expected, we believe it should be a 
source of further value creation for your Company.
 Portfolio activity was moderate during the period under review. We opened a new position in AbbVie, which we 
consider to be an attractively-valued pharmaceutical relative to its global peers, with a strong balance sheet, a good 
Jupiter Dividend & Growth Trust PLC Half Yearly -2-
pipeline of drugs to diversify its income stream and strong cash flows. Other new positions were: computer chip 
designer Imagination Technologies and technology testing business Spirent Communications both of whom have 
seen their margins decimated but offer scope for recovery while NAHL Group is a highly-cash generative personal 
injury marketing services company with an attractive yield.
 Following the takeover of Lloyd's underwriter BRIT we recycled the gain into motor underwriter Direct Line. We 
took profits in engineering consultancy Ricardo and UK specialty pharmaceutical Sinclair Pharma after very strong 
performances by their shares; we recycled the gains into new opportunities.
 We sold our holdings in Aga Rangemaster (as weak sales and a sizeable pension deficit had become a risk to 
shareholders), Amec Foster Wheeler (as demand for oils services suffered from the low oil price), BBA Aviation 
(sluggish activity in its US business jet operations) and Tate & Lyle (weak trading in its sweetener business).
 In the past we had little exposure to banks but have added substantially to our holding in Barclays which looks 
attractively valued, has dealt with the majority of its regulatory risks and aims to improve dividends. Its new 
chairman is well regarded for the way he turned around Aviva. In July, he informed staff at Barclays HQ of his 
intention to double the share price over the next three to four years. We expect further management changes are 
likely to lead to deeper restructuring activity. We also opened a new position in Lloyds Banking Group after it 
returned to the dividend register. We think low valuations combined with potentially strong dividend growth could 
provide a big boost for banks whose operations are predominantly domestic.
 Outlook
 Up until 7 May 2015, there was a universal expectation for the general election to return a government hostile to 
business alongside months of uncertainty and horse-trading from various political parties. This has all been 
avoided, while the July Budget has reassured the majority of consumers and businesses. We would therefore 
expect the UK economy to regain momentum as business investment plans are reinstated. Consumer confidence 
looks set to rise further against a background of lower food and fuel prices, higher employment and the prospect of 
a modest increase in the real value of wages.
 As such, we can expect the domestic economy to continue to tick along well enough for now, albeit against 
headwinds which include comparatively slow growth in the eurozone and Asia. We continue to avoid those 
companies (e.g. miners) exposed to China where the authorities are trying hard to support a slowing economy. We 
are also avoiding companies whose growth prospects depend upon emerging markets because we think the 
likelihood of higher interest rates in the US is likely to be a net negative for those economies. We also expect the 
pace and extent of any interest rate rises in the UK and US to be limited by the fact that falling commodity prices 
and lower food costs have resulted in unusually low inflation, particularly in the UK. This should provide a benign 
background for consumers.
 In the past eighteen months we have reduced your Company's exposure to large cap oils and pharmaceuticals in 
order to be positioned for the growth and cyclical recovery we anticipated. We have a variety of investment themes 
based around companies that have demonstrated the capacity discipline necessary to achieve pricing power and 
reward shareholders. In addition, we hold media companies that should benefit from a cyclical upturn in advertising 
spend as the recovery continues. We also hold some of the stronger motor insurers who should gain from higher 
rates as the insurance underwriting cycle turns up. In the meantime, shareholders are paid to wait with an attractive 
level of dividends.

TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OR REGULATIONS OF THAT JURISDICTION.
 18 August 2015
 AER LINGUS TO JOIN IAG AS OFFER DECLARED WHOLLY UNCONDITIONAL
 Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") will become part of International Airlines Group ("IAG").
 IAG has received confirmation of the valid acceptance of its Offer for Aer Lingus in respect of all the 
Aer Lingus shares held by the Ryanair Group. Ryanair's acceptance was a condition of the Offer which is 
now wholly unconditional as all the conditions have been satisfied.
 IAG chief executive Willie Walsh said: "We'd like to welcome Aer Lingus into IAG.  It will remain an 
iconic Irish brand with its base and management team in Ireland but will now grow as part of a strong, 
profitable airline group. This means new routes and more jobs benefitting customers, employees and the 
Irish economy and tourism".
 Level of acceptances
 As at 1300 (Irish time) on 18 August 2015, AERL Holding Limited ("AERL Holding"), the wholly owned 
subsidiary of International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A., had received valid acceptances of the Offer 
for 517,490,180 Aer Lingus shares, representing 95.77 per cent of the existing issued share capital of Aer 
Lingus.
 Offer status
 The Offer will remain open for acceptance until the final closing date of 1500 (Irish time) on 1 
September 2015. Aer Lingus shareholders who have not yet accepted the Offer are encouraged to do so 
without delay.
 Delisting and re-registration of Aer Lingus as a private company
 AERL Holding is in receipt of valid acceptances in respect of more than 75 per cent of Aer Lingus shares 
and the Offer is wholly unconditional. As such, AERL Holding will request Aer Lingus to apply for 
cancellation of its share listings by the Irish Stock Exchange and UK Listing Authority and the 
cancellation of the admission to trading of Aer Lingus shares on the Irish Stock Exchange and London Stock 
Exchange.  It is anticipated that cancellation of listing and trading will take effect no earlier than 
International Cons Airlines Group Aer Lingus Offer declared wholly unconditional
0800 (Irish time) on 17 September 2015. AERL Holding also intends to take the necessary steps to acquire 
compulsorily any outstanding Aer Lingus shares and to re-register Aer Lingus as a private company.
 Interests in relevant securities
 As at the close of business on 17 August 2015, being the last practicable date prior to this 
announcement, neither AERL Holding nor any person acting in concert with AERL Holding were interested in 
any relevant Aer Lingus securities, apart from those below (excluding as exempt principal trader not 
requiring disclosure).
 --    Willie Walsh was interested in 10,616 Aer Lingus shares;
 --    Goodbody Stockbrokers (save as exempt principal trader not requiring disclosure) was interested in 
593,440 Aer Lingus shares; and
 --    Maura Roe (a partner in William Fry) was interested in 3,500 Aer Lingus shares.
 Acceptances have been received from Maura Roe, Goodbody and Willie Walsh. In respect of Maura Roe and 
Willie Walsh, acceptance has been received for their entire beneficial holding of relevant Aer Lingus 
securities and in respect of Goodbody, 583,440 relevant Aer Lingus securities.
 Settlement of consideration
 All Aer Lingus shareholders who have validly accepted the Offer by 1300 (Irish time) on 18 August 2015 
will be paid on or before 1 September 2015. Shareholders who accept after this time but while the Offer 
remains open for acceptances will be paid within 14 days after the date of their acceptance. Payment will 
be made in the manner described in the Offer Document and in accordance with the requirements of the Irish 
Takeover Rules.
 The Offer document containing the full terms and conditions of the recommended cash offer by AERL Holding 
for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus was posted to Aer Lingus 
shareholders on 19 June 2015 ("Offer Document").
 Defined terms which are not defined in this announcement have the same meaning given to them in the Offer 
Document.

 Statements Required by the Irish Takeover Rules
 This announcement does not constitute or form part of any offer or invitation to sell or purchase any securities or 
the solicitation of an offer to purchase, otherwise acquire, subscribe for, sell or otherwise dispose of any securities, 
pursuant to the Offer or otherwise. The Offer is being made solely by the Offer Document, which contains the full 
terms and conditions of the Offer, including details of how the Offer may be accepted and, in the case of certificated 
shares only, the Form of Acceptance.  Please carefully read the Offer Document in its entirety before making a 
decision with respect to the Offer.
 The Directors of IAG and AERL Holding accept responsibility for the information contained in this announcement. 
To the best of their knowledge and belief (having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case), the 
information contained in this announcement for which they accept responsibility is in accordance with the facts and 
does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information.
 Notice to US Holders of Aer Lingus Shares
 The Offer is being made for securities of an Irish company and United States investors should be aware that the 
Offer Document and any other documents relating to the Offer have been or will be prepared in accordance with the 
Irish Takeover Rules and Irish disclosure requirements, format and style, all of which differ from those in the United 
States. Aer Lingus' financial statements, and all financial information that is included or incorporated by reference in 
the Offer Document or any other documents relating to the Offer, have been or will be prepared in accordance with 
Irish generally accepted accounting principles or International Financial Reporting Standards and thus may not be 
comparable to financial statements of United States companies or companies whose financial statements are 
prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles.
 The Offer is being made in the United States pursuant to the Tier I exemption from the tender offer rules under the 
US Exchange Act and otherwise in accordance with the requirements of the Irish Takeover Rules. Accordingly, the 
Offer is subject to disclosure and other procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer 
timetable, settlement procedures and timing of payments that are different from those applicable under US 
International Cons Airlines Group Aer Lingus Offer declared wholly unconditional
domestic tender offer procedures and law. No action has been taken in any state of the United States to qualify the 
Offer under the laws of any such state.
 IAG and AERL Holding are incorporated under the laws of Spain and England and Wales (respectively). Some or 
all of their directors are residents of jurisdictions other than the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for 
United States shareholders of Aer Lingus to effect service of process within the United States upon IAG, AERL 
Holding, Aer Lingus or their directors or to enforce against any of them judgments of the United States predicated 
upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. It may not be possible to sue 
IAG, AERL Holding, Aer Lingus or their directors in a non-US court for violations of the US securities laws. Further, 
it may be difficult to compel a non-US company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a US court's judgment.
 While the Offer is being made available to holders of Aer Lingus Shares in the United States, the right to tender Aer 
Lingus Shares is not being made available in any jurisdiction within the United States in which the making of such 
offer or the right to tender such Aer Lingus Shares would not be in compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction.
 The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer by a United States holder of Aer Lingus Shares generally will be a taxable 
transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under applicable US state and local, as well as non-
US and other tax laws. Each United States holder of Aer Lingus Shares is urged to consult his independent 
professional adviser immediately regarding the tax consequences of acceptance of the Offer.
 Overseas jurisdictions
 The Offer will not be made, directly or indirectly, in or into any jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so, or by 
use of mail, or by any means or instrumentality (including, without limitation, telephonically or electronically) of 
interstate or foreign commerce, or by any facility of a national securities exchange of any jurisdiction where it would 
be unlawful to do so, and the Offer will not be capable of acceptance by any such mail, means, instrumentality or 
facility from or within any jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so. The release, publication or distribution of 
copies of the Offer Document and the Form of Acceptance and any accompanying document in or into certain 
jurisdictions may be restricted by the laws of those jurisdictions. Accordingly, copies of the Offer Document and the 
Form of Acceptance and any accompanying document are not being, and must not be, released, published, mailed 
or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any such jurisdiction. Persons receiving such documents 
(including, without limitation, nominees, trustees and custodians) should observe these restrictions. Failure to do so 
may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable 
law, the companies involved in the Offer disclaim any responsibility or liability for the violations of any such 
restrictions by any person.

 LOAD FACTOR RISES 4% POINTS TO 95%
 FIRST AIRLINE TO CARRY 10M INTL. CUSTOMERS IN A MONTH
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (5 Aug) released customer and load factor statistics for July 
as follows:
 --     Traffic grew 11% to 10.1m customers.
 --     Load factor rose 4% points to 95%.
 --     Rolling annual traffic to July grew 15% to 95.3m customers.
 --     First airline to carry over 10m intl. customers in one month.

Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "Ryanair's July traffic grew by 11% to 10.1m customers, while our load factor jumped 4% points to 95%. This is the 
first time ever that any airline has carried over 10m international customers in one calendar month. For example we 
carried more customers in one month (10.14m in July) than Aer Lingus carried in a whole year (9.77m in 2014).
 These record customer numbers and highest ever load factors are due to our lower fares, our stronger forward 
bookings and the continuing success of our "Always Getting Better" customer experience programme, which 
continues to deliver stronger than expected traffic and load factors on our biggest ever summer schedule.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR JULY TRAFFIC GROWS 11% TO 10.1M CUSTOMERS
 Ryanair customers can look forward to more service enhancements in the autumn, as we continue Year 2 of our 
AGB programme, which include a new website, new app, new cabin interiors, new crew uniforms, improved inflight 
menus, reduced fees, and great new digital features such as 'hold the fare', as Ryanair continues to deliver so 
much more than just the lowest fares in Europe."

 The offer document (the "Offer Document") containing the full terms and conditions of the recommended

International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. ("IAG"), for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary 
share capital of Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus"), was posted to Aer Lingus shareholders on 19 June

 Level of acceptances
 As at 1300 (Irish time) on 30 July 2015, AERL Holding had received valid acceptances of the Offer in

 The Offer remains subject to the conditions that have not already been satisfied which are set out in 
Appendix I of the Offer Document, in particular acceptance of the Offer having been received in respect of 
the Aer Lingus shares held by the Ryanair Group.

neither AERL Holding nor any person acting in concert with AERL Holding were interested in any relevant

 Statements Required by the Irish Takeover Rules
 This announcement does not constitute or form part of any offer or invitation to sell or purchase any securities or 
the solicitation of an offer to purchase, otherwise acquire, subscribe for, sell or otherwise dispose of any securities, 
pursuant to the Offer or otherwise. The Offer is being made solely by the Offer Document, which contains the full 
terms and conditions of the Offer, including details of how the Offer may be accepted and, in the case of certificated 
shares only, the Form of Acceptance.  Please carefully read the Offer Document in its entirety before making a 
decision with respect to the Offer.
 The Directors of IAG and AERL Holding accept responsibility for the information contained in this announcement. 
To the best of their knowledge and belief (having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case), the 
information contained in this announcement for which they accept responsibility is in accordance with the facts and 
does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information.
 Notice to US Holders of Aer Lingus Shares
 The Offer is being made for securities of an Irish company and United States investors should be aware that the 
Offer Document and any other documents relating to the Offer have been or will be prepared in accordance with the 
Irish Takeover Rules and Irish disclosure requirements, format and style, all of which differ from those in the United 
States. Aer Lingus' financial statements, and all financial information that is included or incorporated by reference in 
the Offer Document or any other documents relating to the Offer, have been or will be prepared in accordance with 
Irish generally accepted accounting principles or International Financial Reporting Standards and thus may not be 
comparable to financial statements of United States companies or companies whose financial statements are 
prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles.
 The Offer is being made in the United States pursuant to the Tier I exemption from the tender offer rules under the 
US Exchange Act and otherwise in accordance with the requirements of the Irish Takeover Rules. Accordingly, the 
Offer is subject to disclosure and other procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer 
timetable, settlement procedures and timing of payments that are different from those applicable under US 
domestic tender offer procedures and law. No action has been taken in any state of the United States to qualify the 
Offer under the laws of any such state.
 IAG and AERL Holding are incorporated under the laws of Spain and England and Wales (respectively). Some or 
all of their directors are residents of jurisdictions other than the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for 
United States shareholders of Aer Lingus to effect service of process within the United States upon IAG, AERL 
Holding, Aer Lingus or their directors or to enforce against any of them judgments of the United States predicated 
upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. It may not be possible to sue 
IAG, AERL Holding, Aer Lingus or their directors in a non-US court for violations of the US securities laws. Further, 
it may be difficult to compel a non-US company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a US court's judgment.
 While the Offer is being made available to holders of Aer Lingus Shares in the United States, the right to tender Aer 
Lingus Shares is not being made available in any jurisdiction within the United States in which the making of such 
offer or the right to tender such Aer Lingus Shares would not be in compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction.
 The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer by a United States holder of Aer Lingus Shares generally will be a taxable 
transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under applicable US state and local, as well as non-
International Cons Airlines Group Aer Lingus Offer Acceptance Level
US and other tax laws. Each United States holder of Aer Lingus Shares is urged to consult his independent 
professional adviser immediately regarding the tax consequences of acceptance of the Offer.
 Overseas jurisdictions
 The Offer will not be made, directly or indirectly, in or into any jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so, or by 
use of mail, or by any means or instrumentality (including, without limitation, telephonically or electronically) of 
interstate or foreign commerce, or by any facility of a national securities exchange of any jurisdiction where it would 
be unlawful to do so, and the Offer will not be capable of acceptance by any such mail, means, instrumentality or 
facility from or within any jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so. The release, publication or distribution of 
copies of the Offer Document and the Form of Acceptance and any accompanying document in or into certain 
jurisdictions may be restricted by the laws of those jurisdictions. Accordingly, copies of the Offer Document and the 
Form of Acceptance and any accompanying document are not being, and must not be, released, published, mailed 
or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any such jurisdiction. Persons receiving such documents 
(including, without limitation, nominees, trustees and custodians) should observe these restrictions. Failure to do so 
may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable 
law, the companies involved in the Offer disclaim any responsibility or liability for the violations of any such 
restrictions by any person.
 Rule 8 dealing disclosure requirements
 Under the provisions of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Rules, if any person is, or becomes, 'interested' (directly or 
indirectly) in 1% or more of any class of 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus, all 'dealings' in any 'relevant securities' of 
Aer Lingus (including by means of an option in respect of, or a derivative referenced to, any such 'relevant 
securities') must be publicly disclosed by not later than 3:30 pm (Irish time) on the 'business day' following the date 
of the relevant transaction. This requirement will continue until the date on which the Offer becomes effective or on 
which the 'offer period' otherwise ends. If two or more persons co-operate on the basis of any agreement, either 
express or tacit, either oral or written, to acquire an 'interest' in 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus, they will be 
deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Rules.
 Under the provisions of Rule 8.1 of the Irish Takeover Rules, all 'dealings' in 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus by 
IAG or AERL Holding, or by any party acting in concert with either of them, must also be disclosed by no later than 
12 noon (Irish time) on the 'business day' following the date of the relevant transaction.
 A disclosure table, giving details of the companies in whose 'relevant securities' 'dealings' should be disclosed, can 
be found on the Panel's website at www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie.

 2015 Annual Financial Report
 The Group's Annual Report and Financial Statements have been posted.
 Chief Executive's Report
 Dear Shareholders,
 We are pleased to present Ryanair's 2015 Annual Report. In 2015 we delivered a record 66% increase in profits, 
from EUR523m in FY2014 to EUR867m this year. We are pleased that most of this growth came from lower 
operating costs (including fuel) while our average fares remained relatively flat. We intend to keep our fares low 
while competitors are raising prices, as this will underpin strong traffic growth over the coming years. Last year 
Ryanair opened 143 new routes, and 8 new bases.
 For the full version of the Annual Report please view the attached PDF

 RYANAIR Q1 PROFIT UP 25% TO EUR245M,
 HIGHER LOADS AS TRAFFIC GROWS 16% TO 28M
 Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (27 July) reported a Q1 profit of EUR245m, up 25% on last year, as 
traffic grew 16% to 28m due to stronger load factors, up 6% points to 92%.

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "We are pleased to report strong growth in traffic and profits in Q1.  Our mix of low fares, best on time 
performance (91% in Q1) and enhanced customer experience under our "Always Getting Better" ("AGB") 
programme, continues to attract millions of new customers.   At the same time our focus on cost (Q1 unit 
costs fell 7%) enables us to pass on lower fares to customers.  Q1 average fare fell 4% to just EUR45, due 
to the timing of Easter, weaker April yields and lower checked bag penetration as more families and 
business customers enjoy discounts on their luggage or benefit from our free 2(nd) carry-on bag policy.
 New Routes and Bases:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
 We continue to be inundated with growth offers from primary and secondary airports, whose incumbent 
carriers are cutting capacity and traffic.  These new airports, along with our 72 existing bases offer 
significant growth opportunities as we embark on our new B737-800 programme.  This winter we take delivery 
of 31 aircraft which (net of lease returns), means our fleet will increase to 340 B737-800's by year end.
 In September we open our 6(th) German base in Berlin where we have a 5% share of the German market and 
expect to grow this strongly over the next 5 years.  Gothenburg (our 2(nd) Swedish base) will also open in 
September.  In November, Israel will become our 31(st) country served when we start flights to Eilat Ovda 
Airport from Budapest, Kaunas and Krakow.
 Two weeks ago we decided, in the best interests of our customers and people, to close our 2 Danish bases 
in Copenhagen and Billund.  This followed threats by the Danish Unions who admitted that they had no 
members among our Copenhagen pilots or cabin crew to get their members (competitor airline employees) to 
blockade/disrupt our flights.  By moving the aircraft from Copenhagen and Billund to airports outside 
Denmark the unions have no legal basis for imposing these threatened disruptions, which allows us to 
continue to grow strongly in Copenhagen without union interference.
 Customer Experience:
 The year 2 rollout of AGB continues apace as we work to improve the travel experience of our millions of 
customers.  In April we cut fees for sports equipment.  In May we upgraded our mobile app to include 
improvements to the "My Ryanair" customer registration function which facilitates faster and easier 
booking of our low fares.  We added Sabre as our 3(rd) GDS partner in June and in July we celebrated our 
30(th) birthday with a 1m EUR19.85 seat sale.
 We have also enhanced our Groups travel service with a dedicated groups page on www.ryanair.com.  Ryanair 
joined Facebook in July, which provides another channel to communicate with, and listen to our customers.  
Ryanair's campaign to "Keep Greece Flying", under which we dropped prices on Greek domestic routes to just 
EUR4.99 one way while also cutting fares on international routes to/from Greece by 30% has been well 
received.  Our on time performance leads the industry, and has further improved in Q1 despite the impact 
of the French ATC strikes, and the closure of T3 in Rome Fiumicino.

There is a lot more AGB development to come later this year, including a new personalised web site in October, 
new aircraft interiors, new crew uniforms and new bases.
 Hedging:
 Fuel is 90% hedged for FY16 at approx. $91 pbl and we have taken advantage of recent lower oil prices to 
increase our FY17 fuel hedging to 70% at an ave. rate of just under $66 pbl.  This will deliver significant fuel bill 
savings in FY17 of up to EUR250m (based on current hedging).  Our advantageous US$ CapEx hedging, along 
with our low cost eurobond financing, will help us to continue to purchase and operate aircraft at very low costs 
which further widens the cost advantage that Ryanair enjoys over all other EU airline competitors.
 Balance Sheet:
 Ryanair's balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry.  In Q1, despite CapEx of EUR324m and 
share buybacks of EUR195m, our net cash increased to over EUR550m (from EUR364m in March).  We have 
completed almost 90% of our current EUR400m share buyback programme which when it closes in August, will 
mean we have returned almost EUR3bn to our shareholders via special dividends and share buybacks since 2008.
 IAG - Aer Lingus:
 On 10 July, the Board of Ryanair voted unanimously to accept the IAG offer for Ryanair's 29.8% stake in Aer 
Lingus.  The timing of this sale is appropriate as our original plan for Aer Lingus (to use it as a mid-priced brand to 
offer competition at primary airports) has been overtaken by our AGB programme under which Ryanair has 
successfully entered many of Europe's primary airports opening new routes and bases but offering competition and 
consumer choice.  As the Ryanair brand develops and continues to grow strongly, the original rationale for 
acquiring Aer Lingus no longer exists.  If the IAG offer is successful, then we would expect to receive these 
proceeds in mid/late September and the Board will consider our use of the proceeds around the time of our AGM.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
 We will continue to oppose the UK CMA's baseless 2013 divestment ruling, (and their recent rejection of Ryanair's 
request to review that decision), which was based on the invented theory that no other airline would bid for Aer 
Lingus while Ryanair was a minority shareholder.  This has been hopelessly exposed by IAG's current offer for Aer 
Lingus, even while Ryanair was its largest single shareholder.
 Outlook:
 Due to the exciting growth opportunities that exist for Ryanair's low fares and AGB customer experience, as well as 
strong customer demand, we expanded our W15 business schedules which will increase our FY16 traffic target 
from 100m to 103m.  This will be achieved through a combination of strong load factor (90%) and fewer winter 
groundings (approx. 40).  Traffic should increase by 13% in H1 and slightly faster at 15% in H2.
 Based on this Q1 performance and reasonable visibility into Q2 (which is heavily dependent on late bookings in 
Aug and Sept) we now believe that ave. fares for H1 will be broadly flat (previous guidance 0% to -2%).  We have 
very little visibility into H2, during which we expect that our faster capacity growth (up 15%) and lower oil prices may 
lead to an aggressive pricing response from competitors who will try to defend their market shares. We therefore 
remain very cautious about weaker prices and yields this winter.  Since Ryanair's policy is to be load factor 
active/yield passive we expect that H2 fares will be towards the higher end of our -4% to -8% guidance range.
 Our focus on unit cost continues and we expect that unit costs will fall by approx. 3% (aided by higher traffic). Fuel 
will deliver a saving of close to 7% and unit costs ex-fuel will be broadly flat.  Ancillary revenue will be well ahead of 
our long term target of 20% of total revenue but will track behind the 14% growth in customer numbers in FY16.
 We think it is too early in the year to alter our full year profit guidance, although the slightly better H1 yields will 
push it towards the upper end of our previously guided range of EUR940m to EUR970m net profit.  We caution 
however that this guidance, which is 12% ahead of last year's profit, is heavily reliant on the final outturn of H2 fares 
over which we currently have almost zero visibility.  Ryanair will continue to pursue its strategy of being load factor 
active and yield passive for the benefit of our customers, our people and our shareholders."

 Transaction in own shares
 27 July 2015
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") has previously announced an intention to return capital to shareholders by 
way of a combination of share buybacks and dividends. The Company today announces that on 27 July 2015 it 
purchased for cancellation a total of 223,200 ordinary shares of nominal value EUR0.00635 each in the capital of 
the Company ("Ordinary Shares").
 The Ordinary Shares repurchased have been repurchased through Citigroup Global Markets Limited ("Citigroup") 
at an average price of EUR12.0716 per Ordinary Share. In respect of this programme, which will operate until 14 
August 2015, Citigroup will make its trading decisions in relation to Ryanair's Ordinary Shares repurchased under 
the buy-back programme independently of, and uninfluenced by, Ryanair. Any such acquisitions will be effected 
within certain pre-set parameters, and in accordance with both Ryanair's general authority to repurchase shares 
and Chapter 9 of the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange.
 Following the cancellation of the Ordinary Shares repurchased on 27 July 2015, the Company will have 
1,355,975,415 Ordinary Shares in issue. To the extent that further Ordinary Shares are repurchased under the 
programme, these shares will also be cancelled.

 Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, weather related 
disruptions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, 
the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK and 
Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political 
factors.
 Ryanair is Europe's favourite airline, operating more than 1,600 daily flights from 72 bases, connecting 191 
destinations in 31 countries and operating a fleet of more than 300 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Ryanair has 
recently announced firm orders for a further 283 new Boeing 737 aircraft, as well as options for 100 more Boeing 
737 MAX 200s, which will enable Ryanair to lower fares and grow traffic from 103m this year to 160m p.a. in 2024. 
Ryanair currently has a team of more than 9,500 highly skilled aviation professionals, and has an industry leading 
30-year safety record.

 --   Available for sale: The fair value of available for sale financial assets is their quoted market bid 
price at the balance sheet date. (Level 1)
 --   Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --   Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of the 
contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at June 30, 2015 has 
been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the quarter to June 30, 2015, there 
were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --   Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at June 30, 2015 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the period to June 30, 
2015 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended June 30, 2015
 Profit after tax increased by 25% to EUR245.1m primarily due to a 16% increase in traffic, a stronger 
load factor (up 6 points to 92%) and a 14% fuel saving per passenger.  Total operating revenues increased 
by 10% to EUR1,652.7m, primarily due to an 11% increase in scheduled revenues to EUR1,248.1m, driven by 
the 16% increase in traffic and a 9% increase in ancillary revenues offset by a 4% reduction in average 
fare.  Fuel, which represents 41% of total operating costs in the current period and 45% in the 
comparative period, decreased by 1% to EUR560.0m due to a lower euro price per gallon paid.  Unit costs 
excluding fuel fell by 1% and including fuel unit costs fell by 7%.  Operating margin, as a result of the 
above, increased by 2 points to 18% whilst operating profit increased by 24% to EUR288.4m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 10% to EUR1,652.7m due to a 16% increase in traffic to 28.0m, 
strong load factors (92%) and a 9% increase in ancillary revenues, offset by a 4% reduction in average 
fare.
 Total revenue per passenger fell by 4% as a 16% increase in traffic and a 9% increase in ancillary 
revenues was offset by a 4% reduction in average fare.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 11% to EUR1,248.1m due to the 16% increase in passenger 
numbers, strong load factors and the strength of sterling against the euro, offset by a 4% reduction in 
average fare partially due to the timing of Easter, weaker April yields and lower checked baggage 
penetration. Load factor rose by 6 points to 92%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 9% to EUR404.6m.  This is lower than the 16% growth in passenger numbers 
partially due to a one-time benefit achieved in the prior year comparative from the early loading of 
schedules.
 Total operating expenses increased by 8% to EUR1,364.3m due to the increased costs associated with the 
growth of the airline offset by a 1% reduction in fuel & oil costs.
 Fuel & oil costs decreased by 1% to EUR560.0m due to a lower euro fuel price per gallon in the period.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
 Airport & handling charges increased by 19% to EUR231.7m due to the mix of new routes and bases launched 
at primary airports, a 16% increase in passenger numbers and the strengthening of sterling against the 
euro.
 Route charges increased by 11% to EUR171.9m due to the increase in sectors flown and price increases in 
Germany, France and the U.K.
 Staff costs increased by 14% to EUR151.8m due to the increased level of activity, the impact of a 2% pay 
increase granted in April 2015, and the strength of sterling to the euro.
 Depreciation increased by 10% to EUR106.2m due to the increase in the number of owned aircraft (June 30, 
2015: 266) compared to the comparative quarter (June 30, 2014: 246), the purchase of 3 spare engines and 
the higher level of heavy maintenance activity.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs, which include ancillary costs, increased by 26% to EUR75.0m, 
mainly due to the launch of new routes and bases, higher on-board sales and additional costs relating to 
the French ATC strike in April.
 Maintenance costs decreased by 10% to EUR31.7m.  This is due to the timing of light maintenance checks, 
unscheduled maintenance which was in the prior year comparative and positive EUR/$ hedging.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 37% reflecting the earlier commencement of short term leases this 
summer.
 Operating margin increased by 2 points to 18% due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits 
have increased by 24% to EUR288.4m.
 Finance expense decreased by 9% to EUR17.3m primarily due to lower interest rates.
 Finance income increased by 16% to EUR10.6m primarily due to higher cash balances and the receipt of the 
Aer Lingus dividend in May.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR85.3m since March 31, 2015 to EUR4,881.2m and Gross debt fell by EUR104.0m to 
EUR4,327.6m.  The Group generated EUR692.2m cash from operating activities.  This funded net capital 
expenditure of EUR323.7m, EUR194.9m of share buy-backs and debt repayments.  As a result the Group's Net 
cash position was EUR553.6m at the quarter end (March 31, 2015: EUR364.3m).
 Shareholders' equity decreased by EUR40.4m to EUR3,994.7m in the quarter due to the impact of share buy-
backs and IFRS accounting treatment for derivatives, offset by the net profit after tax of EUR245.1m and 
changes in unrealised gains on available for sale financial assets.
 Ryanair Holdings plc
 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
 1.                   Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements ("the preliminary financial 
statements"), which should be read in conjunction with our 2014 Annual Report for the year, ended March 
31, 2014, have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim 
Financial Reporting" as adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required 
for full annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published 
consolidated financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at 
and for the year ended March 31, 2014, are available at www.ryanair.com.
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2014 do not constitute statutory financial 
statements of the Group within the meaning of Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group 
Accounts) Regulations, 1992.  The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 
31, 2014, together with the independent auditor's report thereon, have been filed with the Irish Registrar 
of Companies following the Company's Annual General Meeting and are also available on the Company's 
Website.  The auditor's report on those financial statements was unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 on July 23, 2015.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
 The following new and amended standards, that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB), and are effective under those standards for the first time for the financial year beginning 
on or after January 1, 2015, and have also been endorsed by the EU, have been applied by the Group for the 
first time in these condensed consolidated financial statements;

 --      "Annual Improvements to IFRSs". 2011-2013 Cycle (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after July 1, 2014).*
 * These standards or amendments to standards have been EU endorsed and have an effective date for periods 
beginning after February 1, 2015 or can be early adopted.
 The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations in the quarter ended June 30, 2015.
 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.                   Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.       Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 
was 11.8% (June 30, 2014: 12.0%).  The tax charge for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 of EUR32.7m (June 
30, 2014: EUR26.8m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary differences for property, 
plant and equipment recognised in the income statement.
 5.                   Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR1.1m is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.                   Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.                   Capital commitments
 At June 30, 2015 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 317 (2014: 297) Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.  The Group 
has agreed to purchase 183 new Boeing 737 800NG aircraft during the periods Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2019 of 
which 11 aircraft were delivered in the year ended March 31, 2015 and a further 9 were delivered in the 
quarter ended June 30, 2015.
 In September 2014, the Group agreed to purchase up to 200 (100 firm and 100 options) Boeing 737 Max 200 
aircraft from The Boeing Corporation during the period Fiscal 2019 to Fiscal 2024.
 8.       Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR371.0m at March 31, 2015 to EUR383.7m at 
June 30, 2015 is comprised of an unrealised gain of EUR12.7m, recognised through other comprehensive 
income, reflecting the increase in the Aer Lingus share price from approximately EUR2.33 per share at 
March 31, 2015 to approximately EUR2.41 per share at June 30, 2015.
 9.       Analysis of operating segment
 The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Group 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided 
to the CEO, who is the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation 
decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation decisions are made 
based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in 
type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial 
results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Group for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Group has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Group's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Group's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Group is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Group's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management
 We are exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. Our financial risk 
exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The 
Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2014 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the period.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --   Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
Group can access at the measurement date.
 --   Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --   Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:

 Dublin & London, 15 July 2015: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") notes today's judgment by the UK 
Competition Appeal Tribunal dismissing Ryanair's challenge to the decision of the Competition and Markets 
Authority ("CMA") which confirmed that there has been no material change in circumstances or special 
reason for it not to implement the findings of its Final Report of 28(th) August 2013 in which it 
concluded that Ryanair must reduce its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus to 5%.
 This follows yesterday's decision by the UK Supreme Court refusing Ryanair's application for permission 
to appeal against the Court of Appeal's judgment of 12 February 2015. That judgment had upheld the 
findings of the CMA's Final Report.

 10 July 2015
 RYANAIR BOARD VOTES TO ACCEPT IAG OFFER FOR AER LINGUS STAKE
 The Board of Ryanair Holdings PLC today (10 July) confirmed that it has voted unanimously to accept the 
IAG offer for Ryanair's 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus Group plc. Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus has been 
available for sale since May 2012 (see attached) and the Board believes that the current IAG offer 
maximises Ryanair shareholder value.
 In line with this decision, Ryanair will now vote in favour of the motion at the Aer Lingus EGM on the 16 
July next (to give the Irish Government a golden share over Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots) and Ryanair will 
also vote its 29.8% shareholding in favour of acceptance of the IAG offer, subject to this offer receiving 
regulatory approval from the European competition authorities.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "We believe the IAG offer for Aer Lingus is a reasonable one in the current market and we plan to accept 
it, in the best interests of Ryanair shareholders. The price means that Ryanair will make a small profit 
on its investment in Aer Lingus over the past 9 years.
 This sale of our stake is timely given that our original strategy for Aer Lingus (to use it as a mid-
priced brand to offer competition to flag carriers at primary airports) has been overtaken by the 
successful rollout -since Sept 2013- of Ryanair's "Always Getting Better" strategy, which has seen the 
Ryanair brand successfully enter many of Europe's primary airports, being rewarded with strong growth in 
our network, traffic, load factor and profitability, while keeping our fares low and our punctuality high.
 We wish IAG well with their takeover of Aer Lingus. When Ryanair first bid for Aer Lingus in late 2006, 
Ryanair (36m passengers) carried 4 times Aer Lingus traffic (9m). Today Ryanair (over 100m) carries more 
than 10 times Aer Lingus traffic (10m), and we will continue to deliver the vast majority of Ireland's 
traffic and tourism growth in the coming months and years."
 RYANAIR STATEMENT ON ETIHAD'S 2.9%
 STAKE IN AER LINGUS - 1 MAY 2012
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Etihad's purchase of a 2.9% shareholding in Aer Lingus doesn't alter the future of Aer Lingus, which can 
only be decided when or if the Irish Government sells their 25% stake.  If this is sold to Etihad or to a 
financial investor, then it is inevitable that Aer Lingus will be broken up and some or all of its 
Heathrow slots lost to Ireland.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR BOARD VOTES TO ACCEPT IAG OFFER
 "As our 7 Sept 2011 statement made clear, Ryanair will work with whomever the Government sells its 25% 
stake to (if it isn't sold to us), we would welcome any other financially strong airline/investor who 
acquires this stake, and who could then work with Ryanair and other shareholders to restore shareholder 
value, which has plunged by two thirds from over EUR3 to less than EUR1 per share currently under the 
existing Board."
 RYANAIR STATEMENT ON AER LINGUS - 7 SEPT 2011
 Ryanair today (7(th) September) responded to statements reportedly made by Minister for Transport, Leo 
Varadkar that the Government might consider a disposal of its non strategic 25% shareholding in Aer 
Lingus.
 Ryanair wishes to confirm the following:
 1.   If the Irish Govt wishes to dispose of its 25% stake in Aer Lingus, and if the Govt believes that 
any offer from Ryanair for this stake would be unwelcome, then Ryanair is happy to confirm that it will 
not bid for the Govt's 25% stake (although this may result in the Govt realising a lower price for its 
shares).
 2.   Ryanair would welcome another financially strong airline/investor acquiring the Govt's 25% stake, 
which could then work with Ryanair and other like minded shareholders to restore shareholder value, which 
has been destroyed over the past five years by the Board and Management of Aer Lingus.
 3.   Should another financially strong airline/investor acquire the Govt's 25% stake, Ryanair would not 
rule out entering into discussions with that party for the subsequent disposal of Ryanair's near 30% stake 
subject to an acceptable agreement on price and maximising shareholder value.
 Ryanair will not engage in, or comment upon, rumour or speculation, but remains willing to work with any 
other Aer Lingus shareholders to maximise shareholder value which has under the current Board of Aer 
Lingus collapsed by more than 80% from over EUR3.00 per share in early 2007 to less than EUR0.60 per share 
in recent days.

Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
During the month, the Company's NAV fell by 4.8% and the share price decreased
 by 4.2%. For reference, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index was down 5.7% during
 the period.
European equity markets fell more than 4% in June (Stoxx 600, in EUR terms) as
 the Greek bail-out negotiations dominated the headlines. Short term market
 volatility increased as the possibility of a Greek exit from the Eurozone
 became imminent and investor confidence consequently waned. Greece's failure to
 agree a bail-out by the end of the month also led to a sharp fall in the market
 in the last few trading days of June. The political uncertainty weighed on
 business sentiment across the Eurozone, but only modestly so: in the Eurozone
 it fell slightly from 103.8 (May) to 103.5 (June), but remains well above 100.
 Indeed, despite the distraction of the protracted negotiations in Greece, the
 Eurozone economy continued to improve in the month, with France's latest
 reading for the Purchasing Manager's Index exceeding 50 for the first time
 since early 2014.
Stock selection drove the Company's performance in June when compared with the
 reference index, with sector allocation detracting. The Company's higher
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 exposure to industrials and technology saw negative returns on a sector basis;
 however, the higher exposure to financials realised a positive gain.
Lundin petroleum was the Company's top contributor. The share price has
 improved following the receipt of government approval for development of a
 large oil field. This has been further emphasised by the confidence in the
 company to focus on execution with a new CEO. Kingspan, the Irish building
 materials company, had a strong positive return after releasing solid company
 results, with sales over 25% ahead of the same period last year and completing
 the Vicwest acquisition at the tail end of May. Avanza Bank was the largest
 detractor over the month as the share price fell in response to an increase in
 the number of company shares outstanding.
At the end of the period, the Company had higher weightings when compared with
 the reference index to financials, consumer services, technology and
 industrials. The Company had lower exposures to basic materials, consumer
 goods, telecoms, oil & gas, health care and utilities.
Outlook
Despite the performance of European equities year-to-date, we remain positive
 on the prospects for the asset class. We would use the recent pullback in
 markets to add to weightings in a market which offers the best earnings
 momentum globally, coupled with attractive valuations. After five years in
 crisis, economic growth is now recovering across the European region and, with
 supportive monetary policy, should continue to improve over the next 12 months.
 Uncertainties around Greece mean the risk premium on European equities remains
 elevated and has the potential to fall once these uncertainties are removed. We
 do not believe there is any significant danger of contagion to the rest of the
 European area.

 favourable, with extremely low interest rates, and we expect more restructuring
 and merger activity. The Fund emphasises smaller and medium sized growth
 businesses that are typically less well researched, giving opportunity to
 identify value through company meetings and fundamental analysis.
Contributors to performance
Against a background of low inflation, the best performing businesses in the
 consumer sector were those with strong brands, or operating within a growth
 niche.  Luxury group, Ted Baker, and Whitbread with its Costa Coffee division,
 are good examples of this.  Both are expanding their footprint and have good
 management, offering some protection against deflationary pressure. The largest
 portfolio investment, ITV, offers growth and improving earnings quality.
 Historically, returns have been difficult, driven by advertising demand, but
 its investment in production facilities is generating a broad portfolio of
 content with consistent global earnings streams. This will also make it a more
 attractive takeover target for global media or cable groups. Other portfolio
 investments in consumer services include Domino Pizza, Restaurant Group and
 Cineworld.  Consumer goods and services represent 51% of the total portfolio.
The gaming sector is undergoing restructuring internationally, as regulations
 change.  It is a growing industry, and the portfolio includes investments in
 Betfair Group, GVC Holdings and Playtech. There are also investments in more
 disruptive business models where new entrants have an advantage in technology
SVM UK Emerg Fund Annual Financial Report -2-
 or business strategy.  Investments in this group include clothing retailer,
 ASOS, and restaurant delivery business, Just Eat. Both are growing strongly.
 4imprint supplies promotional merchandise via the internet.  The lower oil cost
 and improving consumer confidence should benefit travel businesses, many of
 which have also proved able to manage costs aggressively. This is an area of
 focus for the Fund, and includes Ryanair, SSP, Tui Travel and Easyjet.
One-quarter of the portfolio is invested in the financial sector, with almost
 all of this in non-bank financials.  The largest single group within this are
 Real Estate Investment Trusts and other property companies. These investments -
 Helical Bar, St Modwen, Workspace, Londonmetric Property and Unite - focus on
 effective management teams, typically with a specialisation.  Workspace
 provides tailored business premises for early stage businesses in London, and
 Unite specialises in student residential accommodation throughout the UK.
 Londonmetric invests across the UK, with an emphasis on logistics and
 distribution properties.
Over the year, the Fund increased its exposure to pharmaceuticals, with
 investments in Shire, Hikma, Dechra and BTG.  A new investment was made in
 Hutchison China Meditech which has research and consumer divisions in China.
Portfolio changes
During the year, new investments were made in Just Eat, Restaurant Group,
 Howden Joinery, SSP Group, Micro Focus and Allied Minds. Additional investment
 was also made in several pharmaceutical businesses. Themes in the purchases
 include exposure to global recovery, potential for restructuring or self-help,
 and US Dollar earnings. Each new investment has at least one of these
 characteristics, and all have growth  potential.  Sales of some smaller and
 medium sized companies were made, to fund these new investments.
Portfolio exposure to unquoted investments has been steadily reduced. The
 remaining unquoted investment, Claremont Partners, represents 0.7% of the
 Fund.  Claremont has property in the US, secured against bank loans, and also
 owns land in Taiwan. The Managers do not plan to make any new unquoted
 investments in the current year.
Outlook
Recovery in the US, Eurozone and UK continues to exceed most forecasts. Many
 UK-listed international companies are also benefiting from the recovery in the
 global economy.  The Pound was strong during the year.  However, inflation
 remains extremely low and is running below the Bank of England's 2% target.
Your Fund remains fully invested, reflecting the potential for dividend growth
 and share re-ratings in many portfolio companies.  The portfolio emphasises
 consumer sectors, property, healthcare and business services.  Overall, a
SVM UK Emerg Fund Annual Financial Report -2-
 strengthening UK economy and the prospect of growth in the global economy
 offers a favourable background for UK equities.

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCE HERTZ HAVE ENDED THEIR EXCLUSIVE CAR HIRE SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT
 RYANAIR TO PURSUE HERTZ FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT
 RYANAIR WILL ISSUE AN R.F.P. FOR REPLACEMENT CAR HIRE PROVIDER BY C.O.B TODAY
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (2 July) confirmed that they have this morning received a 
notice from Hertz purporting to terminate Hertz's exclusive car hire supply agreement with Ryanair with 
effect from 12:00hrs 2 July. Hertz allege that Ryanair's agreement with GDS distribution companies 
represents a breach of contract, a claim which Ryanair disputes given that Ryanair has been distributing 
through GDSs since April 2014 (a period of over 15 months) with Hertz's knowledge and support.
 Hertz have confirmed in their notice that all existing bookings will be honoured and customers will still 
be able to modify their bookings on the microsite following its decommissioning at 12:00hrs today. Ryanair 
believes this termination is in breach of its long term exclusive contract with Hertz, which was recently 
extended for a 5 year period to 2020.
 Ryanair will now pursue Hertz for breach of contract and damages. In the interim however Ryanair will be 
unable to offer its customers car hire services through the Ryanair.com website for a period of approx. 3 
months while Ryanair seeks a suitable replacement supplier.
 Separately Ryanair will, by close of play today, issue a request for proposals (R.F.P.) for the provision 
of car hire services to Ryanair's 100m annual customer base. Ryanair would expect to have a replacement 
supplier linked to the Ryanair.com website by October 2015 which will coincide with the launch of 
Ryanair's new and radically improved personalised website and mobile app.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "We regret Hertz's decision to end our car hire agreement at such short notice today, at a time that will 
cause maximum inconvenience to our customers during the peak travel period. We have had a long and 
successful partnership with Hertz, and it's a pity that this has ended in such an unfortunate and untimely 
manner.
 We have instructed our lawyers to issue proceedings against Hertz for breach of contract. In the meantime 
we look forward to entering into discussions with other car hire suppliers who wish to offer their 
services to Ryanair's largest European customer base (100m passengers p.a.) via Europe's largest travel 
website www.Ryanair.com.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR ANNOUNCE HERTZ HAVE ENDED THEIR AGREEMENT
 We apologise sincerely to our customers for the absence of any car hire services on the Ryanair website 
from 12:00hrs today, however this decision has regrettably been forced upon us by Hertz's short notice 
this morning. We hope it will not cause too much inconvenience to our customers while we take a few months 
to identify and agree a suitable replacement provider who wishes to partner with Ryanair during the coming 
5 year period of rapid traffic growth for Europe's lowest fare airline.
 Since we expect that any losses arising from this interruption to our car hire services will be recovered 
from our legal proceedings against Hertz, we do not expect this interruption to have a material impact on 
current earnings."

 RYANAIR LAUNCHES EUROPEAN WIDE PETITION
 TO 'KEEP EUROPE'S SKIES OPEN'
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (1 July) launched an EU wide online petition to prevent 
Europe's consumers having their travel plans disrupted or holidays cancelled by tiny groups of Air Traffic 
Control (ATC) unions going on strike and closing skies over Europe.
 Since 2009, French ATC unions have staged 39 days of strike action, causing cancellations for millions of 
people across Europe. French ATC unions have called another closure (from Thursday 2(nd)  to Saturday 
4(th)  July) which will again result in thousands of flights being cancelled and hundreds of thousands of 
consumers having their flights cancelled and/or delayed. The last closure of French air-space on 12(th)  & 
13(th)  of April this year forced Europe's airlines to cancel over 3,600 flights and disrupted over 
500,000 consumers.
 Ryanair has repeatedly called on the European Commission and European Parliament to take action to 
prevent these ATC strikes causing mayhem for Europe's consumers. Ryanair has today launched Keep Europe's 
Skies Open (www.keepeuropeskiesopen.com), an online petition offering European consumers the opportunity 
to join its call to protect Europe from repeated blackmail and disruption by ATC unions, by either:
 1 - Removing the right to strike from Europe's ATC unions, in the same way that Europe's various police 
and military forces are not allowed to strike. In the USA, ATC unions are prohibited by law from striking. 
European ATC workers can still join unions, organise and advance their concerns through mediation or 
binding arbitration, which will not involve strikes or closing Europe's skies,
 or
 2 - Allowing other European ATCs to manage flights over French airspace during ATC strikes, which would 
minimise cancellations and disruptions for Europe's consumers in Spain, Italy, Germany and the UK, who 
need to cross over French and Spanish airspace.
 When this EU wide petition obtains 1m signatures, Ryanair intends to present it in Brussels and urge the 
EU Commission and the EU Parliament to finally take action.
 Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "It's unacceptable that Europe's consumers repeatedly have their holiday and travel plans disrupted or 
cancelled by the selfish actions of ATC unions every summer, who use strikes as a first weapon rather than 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR PETITION TO 'KEEP EUROPE'S SKIES OPEN'
a last resort. French ATC unions will again stage three further days of strikes this week, which will 
impact hundreds of thousands of European consumers. It is particularly reprehensible that these strikes 
are taking place at the height of the peak summer season, deliberately targeting holiday makers and 
families.
 Today we have launched this            www.keepeuropeskiesopen.com website where consumers can support 
our online petition calling on the European Commission and European Parliament to either remove the ATC 
unions' right to strike, or allow other European ATCs to operate French or Spanish airspace during these 
repeated strikes.
 It's time the Commission and Parliament took action to prevent Europe's families and ordinary air 
travellers having their hard earned holidays or travel plans regularly disrupted by these ATC unions 
closing the skies over Europe. If the EU won't listen to the airlines, perhaps they'll listen to Europe's 
citizens."

 RYANAIR CALLS FOR 3 RUNWAY SOLUTION
 Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "Ryanair believes that the proposed Heathrow runway - which won't be delivered for 10 or 15 years - won't 
solve the runway capacity crisis in the South East. Ryanair strongly advocates taking politicians out of 
runway decision making and allowing each of the three London airports, Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, to 
build 3 competing runways which will solve the capacity crisis in the South East for the next 100 years, 
while at the same time allowing competition between the airports to deliver this capacity efficiently. It 
remains a fact that additional runways in Stansted and Gatwick can and will be delivered much earlier than 
any Heathrow third runway."

 RYANAIR WILL APPEAL CMA'S RIDICULOUS RULING
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 "Today's CMA decision rejecting Ryanair's request to review its order to divest Ryanair's 29.8% minority 
stake in Aer Lingus is manifestly wrong and flies in the face of the current IAG offer for Aer Lingus. 
When the only basis for the CMA's original divestment ruling was that Ryanair's minority shareholding was 
or would prevent other airlines making an offer for Aer Lingus, the recent offers by IAG for Aer Lingus 
totally disprove and undermine the bogus theories and invented evidence on which the CMA based its 
untenable divestment ruling.
 Simon Polito and his group were unable to establish any consumer harm arising from Ryanair's minority 
stake in Aer Lingus and instead resorted to speculating (in the CMA's August 2013 report) that Ryanair's 
29.8% shareholding would deter other airlines from merging with or bidding for Aer Lingus. IAG's current 
offer for Aer Lingus  proves that the the CMA's invented theory of harm was hopelessly wrong, and is now 
unsustainable given that the circumstances have manifestly changed, and accordingly the divestment remedy 
must be revoked in light of this compelling evidence.
 Ryanair has instructed its lawyers to appeal today's ridiculous decision to the Competition Appeal 
Tribunal, given that it is factually unsustainable and legally flawed as the IAG offer for Aer Lingus 
proceeds.
 In parallel, Ryanair's lawyers are currently seeking permission to appeal the unsustainable 2013 report 
to the UK Supreme Court."

 RYANAIR CALLS ON CMA CHAIRMAN TO CORRECT
 HIS FALSE & MISLEADING CLAIMS
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (11 June) called on Simon Polito, the Chairman of the CMA, to 
correct his false and misleading claims in today's statement that "IAG's bid for Aer Lingus is dependent 
on securing Ryanair's agreement to sell its shareholding. This recent development illustrates that Ryanair 
can decide on whether a bid for its major competitor on UK/Irish routes succeeds or fails".
 Ryanair explained that IAG's offer for Aer Lingus has already received public acceptances from both the 
Irish Government and Etihad who between them own approx. 30% of Aer Lingus. If the IAG offer gets to 
50.1%, it is clear that there is nothing Ryanair can do to prevent IAG acquiring control of Aer Lingus. No 
30% shareholder can block a takeover bid if more than 50% of other shareholders accept it.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Both Simon Polito and the CMA are attempting to defend the indefensible. The sole basis for their 2013 
divestment decision was (redacted evidence) that Ryanair's minority stake was or would prevent any other 
airline making a bid for / or acquiring control of Aer Lingus. This bid process - which the CMA contended 
"could not take place" - is now in fact taking place, but Mr Polito and the CMA have again moved the goal 
posts to argue that Ryanair can somehow block an IAG bid for Aer Lingus from succeeding when it is 
patently clear that as a 29% shareholder, Ryanair cannot prevent IAG acquiring control of Aer Lingus.
 Mr Polito should now explain how the CMA can defend this divestment decision when the IAG offer has blown 
it out of the water. He should also withdraw his false claim that a 30% shareholder can block a takeover 
bid, or decide whether any takeover offer is successful or otherwise."
 Editor's note:
 Nothing in this CMA ruling or Ryanair's appeal will alter Ryanair's position in relation to any proposed 
IAG offer which remains (as previously stated), that "Ryanair has not yet received a proposal from IAG for 
our stake in Aer Lingus, but if and when we do then the Board of Ryanair will consider any such proposal 
on its merits in the best interests of Ryanair's shareholders".

 11 June 2015
 CMA confirms requirement for Ryanair to reduce Aer Lingus shareholding
 The CMA has decided that there is no material change in circumstances or special reason for it not to require 
Ryanair to reduce its shareholding in Aer Lingus to 5%.
 This follows the CMA's provisional decision in April 2015.
 The CMA has also today published the Final Order requiring Ryanair Holdings plc (Ryanair) to sell its 29.8% stake 
in Aer Lingus Group plc (Aer Lingus) down to 5%.
 In the light of IAG's current bid for Aer Lingus, the CMA will ensure that implementation of this remedy interacts 
effectively with the bid process and the assessment of the bid by the European Commission.
 Simon Polito, Chairman of the Ryanair/Aer Lingus inquiry group, said:
 "IAG's bid for Aer Lingus is dependent on securing Ryanair's agreement to sell its shareholding. This recent 
development illustrates that Ryanair can decide whether a bid for its major competitor on UK/Irish routes succeeds 
or fails.
 "This concern was an important part of our decision to require Ryanair to reduce its shareholding. It's not good for 
competition when one company holds such an influence over the future of one of its major competitors.
 "Although at this point Ryanair has yet to decide whether to sell its shares to IAG, we need to ensure that, 
whatever happens in relation to this particular transaction, Ryanair's ability to hold sway over Aer Lingus is 
removed.
 "It is clear that the timing of IAG's bid has been influenced by the prospect of Ryanair being forced to sell the 
majority of its shareholding. IAG has said that it would not be interested in acquiring any airline with a significant 
minority investor. The conditional nature of IAG's bid is consistent with this and our original assessment that 
Ryanair's presence was likely to deter other airlines from entering into, pursuing or concluding combinations with 
Aer Lingus.
Competition and Markets Authority Ryanair/Aer Lingus shareholding
 "In our view the circumstances of the IAG bid and other issues raised by Ryanair do not amount to a material 
change in circumstances or special reason not to take action to remedy the substantial lessening of competition 
identified in our 2013 report.
 "We will liaise closely with other authorities to ensure that our requirement for Ryanair to reduce its stake in Aer 
Lingus works effectively alongside shareholders' consideration of the IAG bid and assessment of the bid by the 
European Commission."
 In February 2015, Ryanair had requested that the CMA re-examine its decision to require it to sell its 29.8% stake 
in Aer Lingus down to 5%. This followed a judgment from the Court of Appeal dismissing Ryanair's legal challenge 
to this decision.
 Ryanair argued in particular that IAG's proposed bid for Aer Lingus and the period of time that has elapsed since 
the decision was originally made by the Competition Commission in its report in August 2013, constituted a material 
change of circumstances and that the CMA was no longer entitled to impose a divestment remedy on Ryanair.
 After receiving that request, the CMA invited submissions from interested parties. After considering responses from 
Aer Lingus, IAG and the Irish government - and further submissions from Ryanair - the inquiry group of independent 
CMA panel members provisionally decided that there had been no material change in circumstances or special 
reason not to proceed to implement the remedies set out in the report. Following that provisional decision, which 
was published in April 2015, the CMA considered further submissions before coming to its final decision.
 The decision document, Final Order and all information on the Ryanair/Aer Lingus inquiry can be found on the case 
page.

Ryanair Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs said:
 "Ryanair's May traffic grew by 16% to 9.5m customers, while our load factor jumped by 7% points to 92%, thanks 
to our lower fares, our stronger forward bookings and the continuing success of our "Always Getting Better" 
customer experience improvement programme, which continues to deliver better than expected load factors on our 
significantly expanded summer schedule.
 Alongside our new routes, increased frequencies, Business Plus and Family Extra services, Ryanair customers 
can now look forward to further service enhancements, as we roll out Year 2 of our AGB programme in 2015, which 
includes a new website, new app, new cabin interiors, new crew uniforms, improved inflight menus, reduced fees, 
and great new digital features such as 'hold the fare' and price comparison services."

 Transaction in own shares
 3 June 2015
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") has previously announced an intention to return capital to shareholders by 
way of a combination of share buybacks and dividends. The Company today announces that on 3 June 2015 it 
purchased for cancellation a total of 229,600 ordinary shares of nominal value EUR0.00635 each in the capital of 
the Company ("Ordinary Shares").
 The Ordinary Shares repurchased have been repurchased through Citigroup Global Markets Limited ("Citigroup")

August 2015, Citigroup will make its trading decisions in relation to Ryanair's Ordinary Shares repurchased under 
the buy-back programme independently of, and uninfluenced by, Ryanair. Any such acquisitions will be effected 
within certain pre-set parameters, and in accordance with both Ryanair's general authority to repurchase shares 
and Chapter 9 of the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange.
 Following the cancellation of the Ordinary Shares repurchased on 3 June 2015, the Company will have

programme, these shares will also be cancelled.

Body
 Wizz Air's premium growth rate is also a function of the market in which it operates: Central and Eastern 
Europe (CEE). All of Wizz Air's routes connect to CEE countries where economic growth, and therefore 
growth in demand for air travel, is generally stronger than in Western Europe.
 The demand for air travel in CEE has increased more than five-fold in the last ten years and as a result 
Wizz Air has grown to be not only the largest low cost airline in CEE but also the fourth largest 
independent low-cost airline in Europe after Ryanair, Easyjet and Norwegian Air Shuttle as measured by the 
number of passengers carried.
 The Company took the regrettable decision to close Wizz Air Ukraine in March 2015. This subsidiary had 
already been scaled down to just two aircraft. The Kiev base operation will be further rationalised to a 
single aircraft registered to and operated by Wizz Air Hungary.
 Regulatory Environment
 Wizz Air has its beginnings, and has since prospered, in the liberalised European aviation marketplace. 
Liberalisation has proven to be a very positive development, not only for customers but also for the 
airline industry itself. Increased competition demands cost discipline and those companies that manage 
their costs properly become stronger and more resilient, providing increasing numbers of secure, rewarding 
jobs.
 Liberalisation is also good for the communities we serve. Our ability to start international services, 
linking the capitals and regions of Central and Eastern Europe to the major business centres and leisure 
destinations of Western Europe, fosters integration within Europe. This much enhanced connectivity is a 
key catalyst for the rising prosperity of the towns and cities within our network.
 Wizz Air has also developed services from a number of its home countries to destinations beyond the 
borders of the European Union, to countries such as Georgia, Israel and the United Arab Emirates, all of 
which were made possible by the European Union's continuing push to liberalise aviation relations with 
other countries and regions, an ongoing process that Wizz Air fully supports and encourages.
 However, despite the liberalised environment, challenges do remain. In particular, Wizz Air would 
encourage all authorities to ensure that airlines have access to genuinely competitive infrastructure and 
ground-handling services at major airports. While we believe that competition at all levels is good, that 
competition must be on a level playing field. The time is past for inefficient carriers to exist merely 
because they receive state subsidies.
 Finally, a note on passenger rights. Wizz Air operates a young, reliable fleet and we are committed to 
delivering a high quality service to our passengers. By industry standards, Wizz Air delivers extremely 
high rates of reliability. Only 187 flights out of a total of 105,627 were cancelled in the 2015 financial 
Wizz Air Holdings PLC Final Results -2-
year, of which only a small portion for technical reasons, and only 0.2% of flights were delayed more than 
three hours.
 On the few occasions that flights are significantly delayed or cancelled, we comply fully with all 
applicable rulings related to regulation EU261. Wizz Air pays the relevant compensation in accordance with 
the relevant authorities' guidance. We also believe that the contractual two-year limit within which 
claims must be brought is fair, reasonable and legally valid.
 Strategic Progress
 Wizz Air's ambition is to make safe, reliable and affordable air travel available to everyone in CEE. 
This objective is reflected in the Company's slogan used in its first eleven years: "Now We Can All Fly".
 In order to achieve this ambition the Company operates the youngest fleet of any European airline, to and 
from a range of primary and secondary airports across Europe, offering highly competitive fares and a 
range of additional services designed to satisfy the requirements of as many people as possible.
 The Company is convinced that its strategy of building on its strong network, highly efficient model, 
compelling customer proposition, solid finances and sound risk management policies, will enable it to 
deliver sustainable growth and returns for Shareholders.
 In order to deliver on its strategy Wizz Air has three key objectives:
 1. increase our cost advantage;
 2. build a strong, diversified market position; and
 3. improve the customer experience.
 1. Increase Our Cost Advantage.
 Wizz Air has always been focused on being as efficient as possible and has already established some 
impressive credentials compared to other major European short-haul airlines, including:
 --        the youngest fleet of aircraft;
 --        a strong point-to-point network;
 --        the highest aircraft utilisation;
 --        the highest staff productivity;
 --        one of the highest load factors;
 --        an "unbundled" product producing the highest ancillary income per passenger; and
 --        a group of reliable and efficient outsourced suppliers of key services.
 As a result, Wizz Air is already one of the most cost competitive airlines in Europe. However, the 
Company believes it can become even more cost efficient by:
 --        exploiting scale economies as the Company grows;
 --        taking advantage of its stronger financial standing and easier access to capital following its 
listing on the London Stock Exchange in March 2015; and
 --        reaping the benefits of an increasingly efficient fleet.
 The composition of our fleet at the last year-end and at the next two is the following:

 --------------------------------------  -----------  -----------  -----------
Wizz Air was one of the first airlines to take delivery of Airbus A320 aircraft fitted with winglets. These winglets 
reduce fuel burn and emissions, particularly on longer flights. All aircraft joining the fleet in the future (both A320 
and A321) will be fitted with winglets and therefore this proportion of the fleet will rise steadily over the next five 
years.
 In addition, the Company will take delivery of the larger Airbus A321 from November 2015. Wizz Air has 27 of 
these aircraft on order and, from an operational point of view, they are essentially the same aircraft as an Airbus 
A320 except its longer fuselage accommodates 230 seats compared to 180 on the Airbus A320. The A321s will be 
employed on higher volume routes and provide efficiencies that will enable the Company to offer even lower fares 
to the market.

 2. Build A Strong, Diversified Market Position
 Central and Eastern Europe comprises 21 countries with a total population of over 550 million people. However, as 
this market is relatively under-served by airlines and in particular low-cost airlines, it represents a huge opportunity 
for a low-cost airline.
 At present Wizz Air has operations in 16 CEE countries with an aggregate population of 295 million. We serve the 
market by offering a network of 22 bases and 110 destinations. We are convinced that the ultra-low cost business 
model is best placed to serve this market and as such the Company offers safe, reliable operations, low fares and 
hassle-free services and a distinctive brand designed to appeal to the whole market.
 This approach has enabled the Company to become the number one or number two low-cost airline in all of its 
base countries. The Company's aggregate market share in CEE reached 39.2 per cent. in the 2015 financial year, 
up from 35.6 per cent. in 2010. The table below shows the Company's ranking by low-cost market share in each of 
its base countries.

The Company also offers services from 15 CEE cities where it does not base aircraft and crews. Four new CEE 
points were added in the 2015 financial year: Iasi and Sibiu in Romania, Poprad Tatry in Slovakia and Tuzla in 
Bosnia (becoming a base in June 2015).
 The Company also added six new destinations in Western Europe (WE) during the year: Belfast in UK, Groningen 
and Maastricht in the Netherlands, Lisbon in Portugal, Molde in Norway and Nuremberg in Germany.

In total the Company operates to 110 cities in 38 countries, making it one of the most diversified low-cost airlines in 
Europe.
 3. Improve The Customer Experience
 Market research consistently demonstrates that the most important driver of a customer's choice of airline is ticket 
price. For this reason Wizz Air will remain focused on offering passengers safe, reliable services to a broad range of 
destinations, at the lowest possible price.
 However, the Company also recognises that everyone is different and customers have varying requirements in 
terms of how they access Wizz Air's services and what is important to them when they travel. So, beyond the basic 
product of flying customers from A to B, Wizz Air offers a range of products and services that enable passengers to 
customise their trip to meet their own individual needs.
 These services include a range of seating alternatives, baggage options, flexible tickets, priority boarding and a 
range of on-board purchases. In the Company's view, this "unbundling" philosophy enables Wizz Air to offer each 
customer exactly and only what he or she needs whilst keeping the price of the basic service as low as possible.
 In addition, the Company also provides customers with the opportunity to buy hotel, car hire and public transport 
services as part of the same booking. Wizz Discount Club enables customers and their friends and families to 
benefit from lower air fares than those that are generally available.
 Wizz Air listens to its customers and strives to provide them with what they want. This is why we have upgraded 
our website and made it more user-friendly for all customers but in particular for mobile and tablet users. We have 
introduced allocated seating* across the network and are updating our brand**, modernising the look and feel of our 
aircraft and website.
 Wizz Air remains committed to the view that low-cost air travel can be as comfortable and stress free as travelling 
with legacy airlines, only significantly cheaper. Adhering to this philosophy will help the Company deliver 
sustainable growth and returns for Shareholders.
 * Announced in April 2015, rolled out on flights from May 2015.
 ** Announced in May 2015.
 Looking Forward
 Hedging positions
Wizz Air Holdings PLC Final Results -3-
 Wizz Air operates under a clear set of treasury policies supervised by the Board. The aim of the Company's 
hedging policy is to reduce short-term volatility in earnings and liquidity. Therefore Wizz Air hedges a minimum of 
50 per cent. of the projected US Dollar and jet fuel requirements for the next twelve months (40 per cent. on the full 
18-month hedge horizon).
 Details of the current hedging positions (as at 27 May 2015) are set out below:
 FX Hedge Coverage (Euro/US Dollar)
F16         F17
 Period covered                     10 months   12 months
 ---------------------------------  ----------  ----------
 Exposure (million)                      $521        $784
 Hedge Coverage (million)                $265        $140
 Hedge Coverage for the period %          51%         18%
 ---------------------------------  ----------  ----------
 Weighted average floor                 $1.26       $1.11
 Weighted average ceiling               $1.30       $1.16
 ---------------------------------  ----------  ----------
Fuel Hedge Coverage
F16         F17
 Period covered                               10 months   12 months
 -------------------------------------------  ----------  ----------
 Exposure in metric tons ('000)                     530         736
 Coverage in metric tons ('000)                     366         449
 Coverage with zero cost collars          273          47
 Coverage with fuel caps                   93         402
 Hedge Coverage for the period %                    69%         61%
 -------------------------------------------  ----------  ----------
 Blended capped rate                               $821        $676
 Blended floor rate*                               $801        $672
 -------------------------------------------  ----------  ----------
* Fuel caps provide the Company with protection against the risk of higher fuel prices and also enable the 
Company to benefit from lower fuel costs should fuel prices fall. The blended floor rate for fuel hedges 
shown in the table is only applicable to zero cost collar hedges.
 Sensitivities
 --        Pre-hedging a $10 (per metric ton) movement in the price of jet fuel impacts the 2016 financial 
year fuel costs by $6.3 million.
 --        Pre-hedging a one cent movement in the Euro/US Dollar exchange rate impacts the 2016 financial 
year operating expenses by EUR5.4 million.
 In the Company's view, the profit impact of such changes is likely to be less given the empirical 
evidence of major industry-wide movements in input costs being passed through to air fares with a lag of 
three to twelve months.
 Outlook
 2016 Financial Year
 Wizz Air plans to grow capacity, both in terms of seats flown and Available Seat Kilometres,(ASK) by 
around 17% in the 2016 financial year. This will be split broadly 18% in H1 and 16% in H2. The average 
stage length is expected to be in line with that of the 2015 financial year. A further modest rise in the 
load factor points to a total of 19.4 million passengers handled in the year as a whole.
 Assuming the jet fuel price and Euro/US Dollar exchange rate remain close to the prevailing spot levels 
($625 per metric tonne and $/EUR 1.10 respectively), the Company expects Total CASK to be in line with the 
figure achieved in the 2015 financial year. This comprises an anticipated Fuel CASK decline of 1.5% and an 
increase in Non-fuel CASK of 1%. The expected Fuel CASK decline reflects the combined impact of lower fuel 
prices, a much stronger US Dollar, fuel consumption savings and hedging positions. The rise in Non-fuel 
CASK reflects the impact of US Dollar strength on lease expenses, some modest inflation in crew costs and 
rising airport and air traffic control charges.

Body
 Thanks to our lowest fares, our growth into primary airports and the remarkable impact of our Year 1 AGB 
programme, we continue to experience strong demand and forward booking momentum.  Average load factors in 
the first 4 months of 2015 grew by 10%. While this will slow to 1% or 2% over the peak summer months (due to 
high p/y comparables) forward bookings are on average 4% ahead of this time last year, as our earlier schedules, 
lower prices and AGB customer programme, particularly at primary airports attracts millions of new customers to 
Ryanair.
 While our traffic growth this year will be strong, (up 10%), it would be foolish not to expect some irrational pricing 
response from competitors who cannot compete with our lowest costs and fares.  Ryanair will remain vigorously 
"load factor active/price passive".  Therefore, even with the benefit of lower oil, aircraft and financing costs we may 
suffer periods of fare/yield weakness especially during the H2 winter season. This is why our yield guidance 
remains cautious at broadly flat in H1 but down 4% to 8% in H2 for a forecast FY yield decline of 2%.  If this decline 
proves accurate then we believe that lower unit costs in FY16 will still provide a 10% improvement in profits, which 
should (subject to H2 yields over which we have no visibility) rise to a range of EUR940m to EUR970m for the full 
year to March 2016."

 RYANAIR FULL YEAR PROFIT JUMPS 66% TO EUR867M
 Lower Fares & "Always Getting Better" Services Delivers Record Results
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (May 26) announced a full year net profit of EUR867m, ahead of 
previous guidance.

Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
 "We are pleased to celebrate Ryanair's 30(th) Birthday by reporting this 66% increase in net profit which 
demonstrates the enduring strength of Ryanair's lowest fare/lowest cost model which has been transformed 
by the success of our "Always Getting Better" (AGB) customer experience programme.  AGB has attracted 
millions of new customers to Ryanair.
 Highlights of the past year include;
 -    Traffic up 11% to 90.6m as load factors rose from 83% to 88%
 -    Unit costs ex fuel were flat (including fuel they fell 5%)
 -    Net profits rose 66% as net margin jumped from 10% to 15%
 -    Earlier loading of schedules led to materially stronger forward bookings
 -    AGB Year 1 programme delivered, Year 2 improvements rolled out
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
 -    Ryanair Labs is transforming our digital and mobile platforms
 -    Lead customer order for 200 x B737 Max 200 aircraft
 -    2(nd) Eurobond issue (EUR850m @ 1.125% coupon) lowers our finance costs.
 Business Development:
 Over the past year we have relentlessly improved our lowest fare/lowest cost model.   We have expanded 
into primary airports, added business schedules and extended long term low cost growth deals at major 
bases including London (STN) and Dublin where the Irish Govt has rebooted tourism by abolishing the travel 
tax.
 Our AGB programme is transforming our customer experience, our service, and the way we listen and respond 
to our customers. We have won substantial traffic and share gains in all markets.  We are now the No.1 or 
No.2 airline in most EU countries except France and Germany (where we are a rapidly growing No.3).  Since 
our Year 1 AGB programme has been so successful we have launched our Year 2 programme as part of our 
strategy to make Ryanair Europe's most customer friendly, as well as its lowest fare, airline.
 This combination of lowest fares and improving customer experience has led to higher load factors and 
double digit traffic growth.  To facilitate this growth we have ordered 183 B737-800's for delivery from 
2014-2018, and 200 B737 Max 200's from 2019-2023 (including 100 option aircraft).  These aircraft will 
deliver at lower US$ rates and much lower Eurobond finance rates which (with 8 extra seats and 18% more 
efficient engines) will transform our aircraft costs and enable us to lower fares, which underpins our 
traffic and market share growth, while maintaining and/or growing margins.
 Operations:
 Our summer 2015 fleet of 320 aircraft is insufficient to handle the demand for Ryanair's low fares.  We 
will lease-in 6 aircraft in the peak period (7 in 2014) to help meet this surging demand. We expect over 
half of our growth to occur at primary airports such as Brussels, Lisbon, Rome, Athens, Copenhagen, 
Berlin, Cologne, Dublin and London (STN).  Much of this growth is being stimulated by our Business Plus 
and Family Extra services which have been key features of our AGB programme and our successful 
entry/growth at these primary airports.
 We continue to deliver industry leading punctuality despite the occasional and repeated damage inflicted 
on our operations by unjustified ATC strikes and airspace closures or by adverse weather in different 
European regions during the winter schedule as follows:-
Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Jan   Feb   Mar   Ave
 ------  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----
 FY14    93%   94%   92%   92%   94%   92%   91%   93%   85%   92%   90%   92%   92%
 ------  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----
 FY15    91%   89%   87%   86%   90%   90%   92%   91%   84%   85%   91%   92%   90%
 ------  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----
Last year we set out a strategy to drive stronger forward bookings, encourage customers to book earlier to 
avail of lower prices and deliver higher load factors. These higher load factors have helped to reduce 
unit costs and boosted ancillary sales.  I am pleased that forward bookings, as we enter the S15 peak 
(June to Sept), are on average 4% ahead of last year, and we expect this will lead to a 2% points rise in 
load factors from 88% to 90% in FY16 especially as customers enjoy our AGB service improvements.
 Revenue and Costs:
 We celebrate the 30(th) anniversary of Ryanair first bringing low fares to Europe (8(th) July 1985) by 
growing our traffic 11% to 90.6m customers.  This generated revenue growth of 12% which was a pleasing 
result given we had no new aircraft deliveries in summer 2014. Ancillary revenues grew at a slightly 
faster rate than traffic so total revenue rose 12% to over EUR5.6bn.
 Unit costs which benefited from lower unhedged fuel prices (10% of volume) fell by 5%. Excluding fuel our 
unit costs were flat, which was an impressive performance in a year where we made a substantial move to 
more expensive primary airports without compromising our 25 minute turnarounds.  The fact that we 
maintained flat unit costs (ex-fuel) while many competitors saw their unit costs rise means that our cost 
leadership over competitors has widened during the last year.  This bodes well for our growth, especially 
as we move into airports and routes where our competitors are charging markedly higher fares.  This price 
advantage has helped Ryanair win substantial market share from competitor airlines in Dublin and London 
(STN), in particular.
 Hedging:
 Over the last year we have taken advantage of currency and fuel price weakness where possible, to 
establish a very favourable hedge position as follows:
 -    oil is 90% hedged for FY16 at $92 pbl
 -    oil is 36% hedged for FY17 at $69 pbl
 -    US$ OpEx is 90% hedged for FY16 & FY17 at $1.33 & $1.19 respectively
 -    US$ CapEx is 100% hedged for FY16, FY17 & FY18 at $1.37, $1.34 & $1.23 respectively
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
 This favourable US$ hedging will deliver significant aircraft, maintenance and fuel savings over the next 
2 years, even before we engage in further oil hedging during periods of price weakness.
 Balance Sheet and Shareholder Returns:
 Our rising profits are generating significant free cash flows, which has enabled us to deliver 
substantial returns to shareholders.  In Feb. 2015 we paid our 3(rd) special dividend of EUR520m (EUR0.37 
per share) and then launched our 6(th) share buyback under which we hope to buy and retire EUR400m of 
ordinary shares by the end of August.  This will bring the cash returned to shareholders over the past 8 
years to almost EUR3billion.
 Despite these pay-outs we still finished the year with EUR364m in net cash and a balance sheet rated BBB+ 
by both S&P and Fitch Ratings, the highest rating of any airline worldwide.  We expect our Eurobond 
programme, (under which we have raised EUR1.7bn unsecured at blended rates of 1.50% p.a.) will lower our 
financing costs, boost profitability and continue to strengthen our balance sheet.
 Regulation:
 Europe's airline industry continues to be blighted by over-regulation which frequently places producer 
monopoly protection above the interest of consumers, or growth in tourism and jobs. Examples such as 
Europe's discredited ETS system, the shambles of our single sky project and the failure to prohibit ATC 
strikes (either by "no strike" legislation, or binding arbitration) allows the ATC Unions to regularly and 
repeatedly close Europe's skies.
 The UK CMA's 2013 divestment ruling under which this UK regulator orders one Irish airline to reduce its 
minority stake in another, solely on the basis of "secret" evidence that no other airline would bid for 
Aer Lingus while Ryanair held a minority 29.8% shareholding, has now been hopelessly disproven by IAG's 
offer.  We have written to the CMA calling on them to reverse this ruling but have been amazed that they 
(in their provisional decision) have claimed that the IAG bid for Aer Lingus (which they predicted would 
not happen) is not a "change of circumstances".  We believe the CMA will be totally discredited if they do 
not reverse this manifestly erroneous ruling.
 In the meantime our approach to the IAG offer remains unchanged.  The Board of Ryanair will consider any 
offer (should we receive one) from IAG on its merits, if or when it is received.
 Ryanair strongly supports the development of additional runway capacity in the London market. We believe 
that the market should be free to develop 3 new runways, one each at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted which 
is the only long term solution to the capacity crisis in the South East, and which will encourage all 3 
airports to deliver additional capacity quickly and cost efficiently.

 13. Share buy-back
 In the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company bought back 10.9m ordinary shares at a total cost of 
EUR112.0m under its EUR400.0m share buy-back programme which commenced in February 2015.  This was 
equivalent to approximately 0.8% of the Company's issued share capital. 10.6m of these ordinary shares 
repurchased were cancelled at March 31, 2015. The remaining 0.3m ordinary shares were cancelled on April 
1, 2015.  Accordingly, share capital decreased by 10.6m ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.1m 
and the capital redemption reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.1m.  The capital redemption reserve 
is required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 In the year ended March 31, 2014, the Company bought back 69.5m ordinary shares at a total cost of 
EUR481.7m. This was equivalent to approximately 4.8% of the Company's issued share capital.  All ordinary 
shares repurchased were cancelled.  Accordingly, share capital decreased by 69.5m ordinary shares with a 
nominal value of EUR0.4m and the capital redemption reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.4m.
 14.     Eurobond
 In June 2014, Ryanair issued a 7 year unsecured eurobond, under its EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) 
programme, with a fixed coupon of 1.875% per annum and a notional principal of EUR850.0m. The issue price 
on the bond was 99.52%.
 In March 2015, Ryanair issued an 8 year unsecured eurobond, under its EMTN programme, with a fixed coupon 
of 1.125% per annum and a notional principal of EUR850.0m. The issue price on the bond was 99.41%.
 15.     Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the year ended March 31, 2015 that materially affected the 
financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in the 
related party transactions described in the 2014 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the 
financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
 In October 2014, Michael O'Leary (Chief Executive Officer) signed a new 5 year contract which commits him 
to the Company until September 2019. This new contract replaces a rolling 12 month arrangement under which 
Mr. O'Leary has worked as Chief Executive of the airline since Ryanair Holdings Plc first floated in 1997.
 16.     Post balance sheet events
 As at May 21, 2015 the Company has bought back 21.8m shares at a total cost of EUR233.7m under its 
EUR400.0m share buy-back programme. These shares represent approximately 1.6% of the Company's issued

 Gross cash increased by EUR1,554.2m since March 31, 2014 to EUR4,795.9m and Gross debt rose by 
EUR1,348.0m to EUR4,431.6m.  The Group generated EUR1,689.4m cash from operating activities and 
approximately EUR1,690.9m from its Eurobond issuances in June 2014 and March 2015 (see note 14). This 
funded net capital expenditure of EUR788.5m, a EUR520m dividend, debt repayments of EUR419.7m and 
EUR112.0m share buy-backs. As a result the Group's Net cash position was EUR364.3m at the year end (March 
31, 2014: EUR158.1m).
 Shareholders' equity increased by EUR749.3m to EUR4,035.1m in the year due to the net profit after tax of 
EUR866.7m and the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for derivatives and changes in unrealised gains on 
available for sale financial assets offset by share buybacks.

 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.  Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.    Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the year ended March 31, 2015 
was 11.8% (March 31, 2014: 11.6%).  The tax charge for the year ended March 31, 2015 of EUR115.7m (March 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -5-
31, 2014: EUR68.6m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary differences for property, 
plant and equipment recognised in the income statement.
 5.   Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.
 The Company granted options over 18.5 million shares in the period, under the terms of the 2013 Share 
Option Scheme approved by the Shareholders at the AGM on September 20, 2013 ("Option Plan 2013"). The fair 
value of these options is being recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee 
services rendered.
 6.  Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.  Capital commitments
 At March 31, 2015 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 308 (2014: 297) Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.  The Group 
has agreed to purchase 183 new Boeing 737 800NG aircraft during the periods Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2019 of 
which 11 aircraft were delivered in the year ended March 31, 2015.
 In September 2014, the Group agreed to purchase up to 200 (100 firm and 100 options) Boeing 737 Max 200 
aircraft from The Boeing Corporation during the period Fiscal 2019 to Fiscal 2024. This agreement was 
approved at an EGM of Ryanair Holdings plc on November 28, 2014.
 8.       Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR260.3m at March 31, 2014 to EUR371.0m at 
March 31, 2015 is comprised of a unrealised gain of EUR110.7m, recognised through other comprehensive 
income, reflecting the increase in the Aer Lingus share price from approximately EUR1.64 per share at 
March 31, 2014 to approximately EUR2.33 per share at March 31, 2015.

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the year ended March 31, 2015
 Profit after tax increased by 66% to EUR866.7m primarily due to a 1% increase in average fares, an 11% increase 
in traffic,  a stronger load factor (up 5 points to 88%), and 11% fuel savings per passenger.  Total operating 
revenues increased by 12% to EUR5,654.0m, primarily due to a 12% increase in scheduled revenues to 
EUR4,260.3m, driven by the 1% increase in average fare, aided by the timing of Easter in the first quarter and its 
absence in the prior year comparative, along with a 5 percentage point increase in load factor.  Ancillary revenues 
rose by 12%, ahead of the 11% growth in passenger numbers, to EUR1,393.7m.  Fuel, which represents 43% of 
total operating costs in the current period and 46% in the comparative period, decreased by 1% to EUR1,992.1m 
due to a lower euro price per gallon paid.  Unit costs excluding fuel remained flat, however, including fuel unit costs 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
fell by 5%.  Operating margin, as a result of the above, increased by 5 points to 18% whilst operating profit 
increased by 58% to EUR1,042.9m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 12% to EUR5,654.0m primarily due to (i) a 1% increase in average fare, (ii) 
an 11% increase in traffic to 90.6m and a strong load factor (88%), (iii) the timing of Easter in the first quarter and its 
absence in the prior year comparative and (iv) the strength of sterling to the euro. Ancillary revenues increased by 
12%, ahead of the 11% increase in passenger numbers.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 1%, primarily due to the strong growth in scheduled revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 12% to EUR4,260.3m due to a 1% rise in average fares, partially due 
to the timing of Easter and its absence in the prior year comparative, along with an 11% increase in passenger 
numbers, strong load factors and the strength of sterling against the euro. Load factor rose by 5 points to 88%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 12% to EUR1,393.7m, ahead of the 11% increase in passenger numbers.
 Total operating expenses increased by 5% to EUR4,611.1m due to the increased costs associated with the growth 
of the airline offset by a 1% reduction in fuel costs.
 Fuel & oil costs decreased by 1% to EUR1,992.1m due to a lower euro fuel price per gallon in the period.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 15%, as expected, to EUR712.8m, due to the mix of new routes and 
bases launched at primary airports, an 11% increase in passenger numbers and the strengthening of sterling 
against the euro.
 Route charges increased by 5% to EUR547.4m due to the increase in sectors flown and price increases in 
Germany, France and the U.K.
 Staff costs increased by 8% to EUR502.9m due to the increased level of activity, the impact of a 2% pay increase 
granted in April 2014, and the strength of sterling to the euro.
 Depreciation increased by 7% to EUR377.7m due to 11 aircraft deliveries, the purchase of 5 spare engines in the 
year, and the higher level of maintenance activity.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs, which include ancillary costs, increased by 21% to EUR233.9m, mainly due to 
higher marketing spend to support Ryanair's "Always Getting Better" customer programme and the launch of new 
routes and bases.
 Maintenance costs increased by 16% to EUR134.9m,  partly due to the inclusion in the prior year comparative of a 
one off credit of EUR3.7m arising from the renegotiation of certain maintenance contracts. The remainder of the 
increase is due to line maintenance costs resulting from the launch of new bases, unscheduled maintenance costs 
and the strength of sterling to the euro.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 8% to EUR109.4m, reflecting short term leases over the summer, offset by a 
lower average number of leased aircraft in the period (March 31, 2015: 51) compared to the prior year (March 31, 
2014: 55).
 Operating margin increased by 5 points to 18% due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits have 
increased by 58% to EUR1,042.9m.
 Finance expense decreased by 11% to EUR74.2m primarily due to lower interest rates.
 Finance income increased by 9% to EUR17.9m primarily due to higher cash balances.

Body
 The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, including 
scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Group operates a single fleet of 
aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the 
CEO, who is the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation decisions the 
CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation decisions are made based on the 
entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type.  The objective in 
making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes 
within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of the 
Group for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Group has a single reportable segment, 
intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Group's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed across the 
Group's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment operations.  In addition, as the 
Group is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities have been allocated to the Group's 
single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 11.      Property, plant and equipment
 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the year to March, 2015 amounted to EUR788.5m and primarily relates to aircraft 
pre delivery payments, 11 aircraft deliveries and delivery of 5 new spare engines.
 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management
 We are exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. Our financial risk 
exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The 
Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2014 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --   Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
Group can access at the measurement date.
 --   Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --   Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --   Available for sale: The fair value of available for sale financial assets is their quoted market bid 
price at the balance sheet date. (Level 1)
 --   Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --   Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of the 
contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2015 has 
been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -6-
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the year to March 31, 2015, there were 
no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy 
used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --   Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at March 31, 2015 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the period to March 
31, 2015 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

Ryanair Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs said:
 "Ryanair's April traffic grew by 16% to 9m customers, while our load factor jumped by 7% points to 91%, thanks to 
our lower fares, our stronger forward bookings and the continuing success of our "Always Getting Better" customer 
experience improvement programme, which continues to deliver better than expected load factors on our 
significantly expanded summer schedule.
 Alongside our new routes, increased frequencies, Business Plus and Family Extra services, Ryanair customers 
can now look forward to further service enhancements, as we roll out Year 2 of our AGB programme in 2015, which 
includes a new website, new app, new cabin interiors, new crew uniforms, improved inflight menus, reduced fees, 
and great new digital features such as 'hold the fare' and price comparison services."

purchased for cancellation a total of 261,600 ordinary shares of nominal value EUR0.00635 each in the capital of 
the Company ("Ordinary Shares").
 The Ordinary Shares repurchased have been repurchased through Citigroup Global Markets Limited ("Citigroup")

within certain pre-set parameters, and in accordance with both Ryanair's general authority to repurchase shares 
and Chapter 9 of the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange.
 Following the cancellation of the Ordinary Shares repurchased on 22 April 2015, the Company will have 
1,373,081,022 Ordinary Shares in issue. To the extent that further Ordinary Shares are repurchased under the 
programme, these shares will also be cancelled.

Body
 Our decision to avoid mining stocks proved correct; the price of iron ore plummeted during the period as demand 
from China waned. We favoured insurance companies (e.g. Brit, Prudential and Legal & General), over banks 
because they already offered attractive, rising dividends and operate under a less repressive regulatory regime. 
That said, in the latter part of the year, we took a position in Barclays which as one of the cheapest banks in Europe 
we considered to be a special situation value play. Its new chairman comes from Aviva where he has demonstrated 
his ability to turn around the company. Barclays has passed its stress tests and has the potential to substantially 
improve its dividends.
 Capacity discipline, which then creates pricing power, is one of our major investment themes which should serve 
investors well in a low growth environment. We have positions in airlines (Ryanair and International Airlines Group), 
motor underwriters (esure), housebuilders (Crest Nicholson and Galliford Try) and packaging company Mondi. All 
these companies have shown disciplined use of their capital and in common with ITV (media) and Friends Life 
(insurance) have increased returns to shareholders in the absence of better alternative investment opportunities.
 In the first half of the year we cut holdings in Halma and Spirax-Sarco. Both had significant international exposure 
and we were concerned about the speed at which sterling had strengthened against the dollar. We also reduced 
positions in BBA Aviation and Babcock International. In the latter half of the year we sold Lancashire Holdings, Mitie 
and most of Tate & Lyle. We added to holdings in Brit, Conviviality Retail, esure, GKN, KCOM, Playtech, Ryanair 
and Vodafone. Following the sharp fall in the oil price towards the year end we reduced our exposure to the sector 
by trimming positions in BP and IMI. We also trimmed back positions in AstraZeneca, BT, Cineworld, Micro Focus 
International and Sinclair IS Pharma.
 Outlook
 The sharp drop in the oil price alongside politically-inspired reductions in future household energy bills, lower food 
prices and a smidgeon of real wage growth all sit comfortably alongside the unacknowledged pre-election boom 
carefully engineered by the Chancellor. As such, we can expect a consumer-dominated economy to continue to tick 
along well enough for now, albeit against headwinds which include slower growth in the eurozone and Asia. 
Manufacturing exporters look particularly sensitive to the latter. Nevertheless, our equity holdings in airlines, 
Jupiter Dividend & Growth Trust PLC Annual -2-
housebuilders, consumer stocks and specialty financials have continued to benefit from a broadly benign domestic 
environment.
 In an ideal world, further investment and rising exports could take up the baton of the Chancellor's domestically-
generated growth which successfully kick-started the economy in 2013. But, for the time being, we think shorter 
term momentum in the UK economy versus its developed nation peers looks set to continue. Furthermore, the low 
cost of borrowing for corporations and their serial underinvestment makes us think that M&A activity could be a big 
feature of 2015 which should provide some additional support.
 Quantitative easing has succeeded in pushing up the prices of numerous asset classes. Central bank 
determination to suppress bond yields suggests to us that the total return from investment grade bonds is therefore 
likely to be limited. In a world where many government bond yields are close to zero or have turned negative, it 
seems to us that the search for yield is likely to continue, if not to intensify. Fortunately, we are able to identify 
companies with good individual growth prospects which have the ability to pay attractive and rising dividends. As 
such, your Company remains fully invested.

 Transaction in own shares
 17 April 2015
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") has previously announced an intention to return capital to shareholders by 
way of a combination of share buybacks and dividends. The Company today announces that on 17 April 2015 it 
purchased for cancellation a total of 271,282 ordinary shares of nominal value EUR0.00635 each in the capital of 
the Company ("Ordinary Shares").
 The Ordinary Shares repurchased have been repurchased through Citigroup Global Markets Limited ("Citigroup") 
at an average price of EUR11.0266 per Ordinary Share. In respect of this programme, which will operate until 14 
August 2015, Citigroup will make its trading decisions in relation to Ryanair's Ordinary Shares repurchased under 
the buy-back programme independently of, and uninfluenced by, Ryanair. Any such acquisitions will be effected 
within certain pre-set parameters, and in accordance with both Ryanair's general authority to repurchase shares 
and Chapter 9 of the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange.
 Following the cancellation of the Ordinary Shares repurchased on 17 April 2015, the Company will have 
1,373,875,072 Ordinary Shares in issue. To the extent that further Ordinary Shares are repurchased under the 
programme, these shares will also be cancelled.

 News Story
 17 April 2015
 CMA provisionally decides to proceed with Ryanair/Aer Lingus remedies
 The CMA has provisionally decided that there is no material change in circumstances or special reason for it not to 
implement the remedies in the Ryanair/Aer Lingus inquiry.
 In February, Ryanair requested that the CMA re-examine its decision to require it to sell its 29.8 per cent stake in 
Aer Lingus Group plc (Aer Lingus) down to 5 per cent. This followed a judgment from the Court of Appeal 
dismissing Ryanair's legal challenge to this decision.
 Ryanair argued in particular that IAG's proposed bid for Aer Lingus and the period of time that has elapsed since 
the decision was originally made by the Competition Commission in its Report in August 2013, constitute a material 
change of circumstances and that the CMA no longer had the power to impose a divestment remedy on Ryanair.
 After receiving that request, the CMA invited submissions from interested parties. After considering responses from 
Aer Lingus, IAG and the Irish Government - and further submissions from Ryanair - the inquiry group of 
independent CMA panel members considering this issue has provisionally decided that there is no material change 
in circumstances or special reason not to proceed to implement the remedies set out in the Report. The CMA will 
now consider further responses before taking its final decision.
 The CMA is also consulting on the terms of a draft final order that would implement the remedies. In the event that 
it maintains its provisional decision, the CMA would expect to make a final order taking account of any comments it 
received on this draft final order
 Simon Polito, Chairman of the Ryanair/Aer Lingus Inquiry Group, said:
Competition and Markets Authority Ryanair / Aer Lingus MCC provisional decision
 "Our provisional view is that the circumstances around IAG's proposed bid are consistent with the findings in our 
Report.
 "As the decisions in our report made clear, without any action to reduce its shareholding, Ryanair would remain a 
significant hurdle to any merger because it has an incentive as a competitor of Aer Lingus and, by its shareholding, 
the ability to hinder Aer Lingus from implementing its own commercial strategy.
 "We have carefully considered submissions from Ryanair and others and taken into account all the relevant 
circumstances, including the fact that the IAG bid is conditional on receiving an irrevocable commitment from 
Ryanair. Having done so, our provisional view is that neither recent events nor the time that has passed since our 
final report are reasons not to implement the divestment remedy."
 The provisional decision document and all information on the Ryanair/Aer Lingus inquiry can be found on the CMA 
website.

Ryanair Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs said:
 "Ryanair's March traffic grew by 28% to 6.67m customers, while our load factor jumped by 10% points to 90%, 
thanks to our lower fares, our stronger forward booking strategy and the continuing success of our "Always Getting 
Better" customer programme, which continues to deliver better than expected load factors on our significantly 
expanded winter schedule.
 With our new routes, increased frequencies and Business Plus service, customers can now look
 forward to further service enhancements, as we roll out the 2nd year of our AGB programme in 2015,
 which includes a new website and app, new cabin interiors, new crew uniforms and inflight menus,
 reduced airport fees, and great new digital features such as 'hold the fare', destination content and fare
 comparison services."

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES EUR850M EURO BOND ISSUE AT 1.125% FIXED FOR 8 YEARS
 Ryanair today (3 March) announced that it has issued an 8 year, EUR850m Euro Bond at a fixed coupon of 
1.125%. This follows Ryanair's very successful debut issuance in June 2014 and secures further low cost financing 
for our 380 new Boeing 737 aircraft orders, deliveries of which started in September 2014.
 Ryanair is the world's most highly rated airline, with a BBB+ rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. 
These ratings reflect the strength of Ryanair's business model which has a long established track record of 
profitability, cash generation, and a very strong balance sheet with low levels of debt.
 The bond will be listed on the Irish Stock Exchange which offers access to investors both in Europe and the rest of 
the world. The joint book runners were BNP Paribas, Citigroup, and Credit Agricole.
 Ryanair's Chief Financial Officer, Neil Sorahan, said:
 "We are pleased to have accessed the low cost Euro Bond markets again. Our EUR850m, 8 year, transaction was 
very keenly priced at a fixed coupon of 1.125%. The bond was more than 3 times oversubscribed, reflecting the 
strong demand from bond investors for Ryanair.
 This low cost finance, coupled with our attractively priced Boeing orders for 380 new Boeing 737 aircraft, will 
enable us to further reduce our aircraft ownership costs while continuing to offer the lowest fares and improving 
travel experience under our "always getting better" programme to our customers as we grow traffic from 90m 
customers p.a. this year to 160m p.a. by 2024."

 Given Aer Lingus' improved operating performance in 2014 compared to 2013, the Board has agreed to 
recommend to shareholders that this increased profitability should be translated into a return of value to 
shareholders in the form of an increase in the annual dividend from four cent per share (paid in respect of 2013) to 
five cent per share (payable in respect of 2014). This proposed dividend of five cent per share will be payable to 
shareholders regardless of whether the proposed IAG offer proceeds. In the event that the IAG offer does proceed, 
the proposed dividend will equate to the cash dividend of five cent per share which is part of the IAG offer.
 In December 2012, the Group entered into an agreement for the assignment of its interest in the lease of a hangar 
facility at Shannon Airport. Under the terms of this arrangement, Aer Lingus has provided a guarantee to Dublin 
Airport Authority in respect of rents that would otherwise have been payable by the Group under the lease up to 31 
July 2021. The Group estimates the maximum amount payable would be approximately EUR3.1 million in the event 
that the guarantee was called. In previous years, the Group had disclosed this guarantee as a contingent liability. In 
January 2015, Transaero entered into examinership and there is a likelihood that the Shannon Group will enforce 
the guarantee. As this provided evidence that the conditions existed at the balance sheet date, management 
determined that the remaining lease obligations guaranteed by Aer Lingus are an 'onerous lease' requiring 
recognition of a provision. Management will endeavour to mitigate this risk depending on the outcome of the 
Transaero examinership process.
 On 5 February 2015, the European General Court annulled the EC's decision regarding air travel tax in so far as it 
ordered the recovery of the aid from the beneficiaries for an amount set at EUR8 per passenger.  Refer to Note 24 
for more detail on this development.
 The UK Court of Appeal rejected Ryanair's appeal on 12 February 2015. The Court also refused permission for 
Ryanair to appeal to the Supreme Court. Ryanair has stated that it intends to apply to the Supreme Court for 
permission to appeal.  It is not currently known when this request will be considered by the Supreme Court or 
whether the Supreme Court will grant such permission to appeal.
 On the 16 February 2015, Mr. Stephen Kavanagh's appointment as Chief Executive Officer of Aer Lingus Group 
plc with effect from 1 March 2015 was announced.
Aer Lingus Group PLC 2014 Preliminary Results -21-
 As noted in Note 20, 28% of waivers have been received as at 19 February 2015. Therefore, the EUR190.7 million 
one off contribution (as discussed in Note 23 and Note 8 (d)) has reduced by approximately EUR54.2 million and 
the post retirement income streaming pension obligation (as discussed in Note 21 and Note 8 (e)) has reduced by 
approximately EUR4.5 million at 19 February 2015.
 There have been no other significant events occurring after the reporting period, up to and including the date of 
approval of the financial information within this preliminary announcement by the Board of Directors.

 Transaction in own shares
 19 February 2015
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") has previously announced an intention to return capital to shareholders by 
way of a combination of share buybacks and dividends. The Company today announces that on 19 February 2015 
it purchased for cancellation a total of 360,000 ordinary shares of nominal value EUR0.00635 each in the capital of 
the Company ("Ordinary Shares").
 The Ordinary Shares repurchased have been repurchased through Citigroup Global Markets Limited ("Citigroup")

August 2015, Citigroup will make its trading decisions in relation to Ryanair's Ordinary Shares repurchased under 
the buy-back programme independently of, and uninfluenced by, Ryanair. Any such acquisitions will be effected 
within certain pre-set parameters, and in accordance with both Ryanair's general authority to repurchase shares 
and Chapter 9 of the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange.
 Following the cancellation of the Ordinary Shares repurchased on 19 February 2015, the Company will have 
1,384,710,224 Ordinary Shares in issue. To the extent that further Ordinary Shares are repurchased under the 
programme, these shares will also be cancelled.

SATISFIED OR WAIVED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 13 February 2015
 Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus" or the "Company")
 ISE: EIL1                    LSE: AERL
 Possible Offer Update
 On 27 January 2015, the Board of Directors of Aer Lingus (the "Board") announced that it had indicated to 
International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. ("IAG") that the financial terms of IAG's proposal (the 
"Revised Proposal") valuing each Aer Lingus share at EUR2.55 (comprising  a cash offer of EUR2.50 and a 
dividend of EUR0.05 per share) were at a level that the Board would be willing to recommend, subject to 
being satisfied with the manner in which IAG proposed to address the interests of relevant parties. The 
Board continues to believe that the financial terms of the Revised Proposal are in the best interests of 
Aer Lingus' shareholders.
 The Revised Proposal remains conditional on, amongst other things, confirmatory due diligence, the 
recommendation of the Board of Aer Lingus and the receipt of irrevocable commitments from Ryanair Limited 
and the Minister for Finance of Ireland to accept the offer, all of which may be waived in whole or in 
part by IAG.
 Aer Lingus Chairman, Colm Barrington said: "Over recent weeks the Board of Aer Lingus has listened 
carefully to the public debate which has taken place regarding IAG's proposal. We have had further 
detailed discussions with IAG and the Board has a greater understanding of IAG's intentions for the future 
of Aer Lingus and the proposed commitments that IAG is prepared to make in relation to Aer Lingus. These 
discussions have further confirmed that it is clearly in IAG's interests to continue to grow Aer Lingus 
within the IAG Group.  The Board's view is therefore that a combination of Aer Lingus with IAG has a 
compelling strategic rationale and will deliver significant benefits for Aer Lingus, its employees, its 
customers and for Ireland."
Aer Lingus Group PLC Possible Offer Update
 On 11 February 2015, Aer Lingus met the interdepartmental group established by the Minister for 
Transport, Tourism and Sport (the "Minister") to set out the Board's views on these benefits. Aer Lingus 
also discussed these matters with the Minister on 12 February 2015.
 At the meetings with the interdepartmental group and the Minister, Aer Lingus set out the following 
benefits as the key commercial drivers of the Board's view that IAG's proposal represents a compelling and 
significantly positive opportunity for Aer Lingus, its employees, its customers and for Ireland:
 n Enhancing Ireland's position as a natural hub for Europe on the North Atlantic
 -  Ireland's location at the western-most point in Europe makes it a natural gateway to connect the 
combined populations of Europe and North America
 -  Aer Lingus believes that IAG's proposal can enable Ireland to become a central hub for European 
traffic across the Atlantic resulting in better utilisation of the infrastructural investment that has 
taken place at Irish airports
 n Accelerating Aer Lingus' transatlantic, long haul growth plans
 -  Aer Lingus sees the potential for its planned growth in transatlantic traffic to be significantly 
accelerated and for new US destinations to be added to its network.
 n Growing employment
 -  Additional transatlantic traffic and destinations growth will create significant numbers of new jobs 
in Ireland: new direct and highly skilled jobs within Aer Lingus and new indirect jobs in support 
activities and the tourism sector
 n Enhancing  short haul growth
 -  Aer Lingus' short-haul services, including on the Dublin, Cork and Shannon to London Heathrow routes, 
will directly benefit from sales and marketing activity conducted on its behalf by the British Airways, 
Iberia, Vueling and oneworld partner sales forces
 n Strengthening Ireland's connectivity
 -  The anticipated benefits to both Aer Lingus' long-haul and short-haul networks brought about by Aer 
Lingus being part of the larger IAG group will result in better connectivity to and from Ireland
 n Accessing a global cargo network
 -  Aer Lingus' cargo business will benefit from the global network reach and sales channels of the IAG 
Cargo business. This enhancement of the cargo network is expected to deliver significant benefits and 
additional options to Irish businesses, in particular the pharmaceutical and semi-conductor industries.
 As part of the discussions with IAG, Aer Lingus has also confirmed IAG's intentions to preserve Aer 
Lingus as a separate operating business within the group with its own brand, management, head office and 
operations.
 Aer Lingus Chairman, Colm Barrington concluded:  "The strong view of the Board of Aer Lingus is that the 
prospect of Aer Lingus being part of the IAG Group has a compelling commercial logic for Aer Lingus, has 
significantly positive benefits for Ireland and is strongly supportive of the Irish Government's two 
airline policy.  Following a combination with IAG, Aer Lingus will have a markedly greater number of more 
attractive growth options that will significantly benefit the Company, its employees, its customers, the 
tourism sector, Irish business and industry and the airports at which Aer Lingus operates and Ireland."
 This statement is being made by Aer Lingus with the consent of IAG. There can be no certainty that any 
offer will be made. The Board will make a further update as appropriate.

 Court of Appeal rejects Ryanair's challenge to the Competition Appeal Tribunal's judgment
 Aer Lingus welcomes today's decision by the Court of Appeal rejecting the challenge Ryanair brought 
against the judgment of the Competition Appeal Tribunal ("CAT").
 In March 2014, the CAT dismissed Ryanair's appeal against the UK Competition Commission's ("CC") Report 
that ruled Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus to be anti-competitive and required it to sell down its 
29.82% stake in Aer Lingus to 5%. The Report also limits Ryanair's ability to re-acquire shares.
 Ryanair appealed the CAT's judgment on a number of grounds, all of which have been rejected in today's 
ruling. The Court also refused permission for Ryanair to appeal to the Supreme Court.
 This is the third time that the Court of Appeal has rejected Ryanair's attempts to derail the UK 
competition authorities' investigations and findings.

 RYANAIR TO APPEAL AER LINGUS SELL-DOWN RULING
 IAG'S RECENT OFFER FOR AER LINGUS UNDERMINES UK COMPETITION COMMISSION CASE
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (12 Feb) noted the UK Court of Appeal's judgment concerning 
Ryanair's appeal of the UK Competition Commission's (now "the CMA") Final Report regarding Ryanair's 29% 
stake in Aer Lingus.  The Court of Appeal considered Ryanair's arguments about the CMA's breach of the EU 
law duty of sincere cooperation and of Ryanair's procedural rights, as well as the disproportionality of 
the divestment remedy imposed on Ryanair, but refused to set the CMA's decision aside.  Ryanair will now 
appeal this case to the UK Supreme Court, as it raises human rights issues of significant public 
importance, including the scope of protection offered to businesses by the right to property.
 In parallel, Ryanair has requested a formal review by the CMA of its Final Report, and a withdrawal of 
the divestment remedy, in light of the recent offers by the International Airlines Group (IAG) for Aer 
Lingus, which fully disprove the theories and unsubstantiated evidence on which the Final Report was 
based.  The CMA speculated in its Final Report that Ryanair's 29% shareholding would deter other airlines 
from merging with or bidding for Aer Lingus.  Clearly, IAG's recent offers demonstrate that the CMA's 
findings were wrong and that its divestment remedies must be revoked in light of this compelling evidence.
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 "While we note the Court of Appeal's ruling on the CMA's Final Report on Ryanair's 29%  stake in Aer 
Lingus, this judgment ignores the fact that the CMA's Final Report was based on fanciful hypotheses, 
secretive "evidence" and unsubstantiated assumptions.  As such, we have instructed our lawyers to appeal 
this ruling to the UK Supreme Court.
 Additionally, Ryanair has now requested a formal review by the CMA of its Final Report, and a withdrawal 
of the divestment remedy, in light of the recent IAG offers for Aer Lingus, which wholly disprove the 
CMA's unsubstantiated claim that Ryanair's shareholding somehow prevented other airlines from merging with 
or bidding for Aer Lingus. Clearly the CMA's case has now been totally undermined by the IAG offers."

Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
During the month, the Company's NAV returned 6.1% and the share price returned
 4.1%. For reference, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index returned 4.2% during the
 same period.
European equities delivered the strongest monthly performance in over three
 years in January. A number of key developments transpired in the month,
 including the removal of the Swiss National Bank's peg to the Euro, the
 announcement of full-scale Quantitative Easing (QE) at the European Central
 Bank (ECB), and closely-watched Greek elections later in the month. Most
 significantly, the ECB's governing council announced that it will buy EUR60bn of
 Euro-denominated investment-grade bonds per month, at least up to September
 2016. This open-ended commitment exceeded the market's initial expectations and
 led to a rally in markets and further compression in bond yields. The Euro also
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 continued to weaken, providing a further tailwind (along with the weak oil
 price) to future corporate profits. Within the market, health care, food &
 beverage and household goods performed best, while banks, oil & gas and basic
 resources underperformed the most. Later in the month, early signs of improving
 economic activity in Europe came to light, with business confidence surveys,
 consumer confidence and earnings revisions proving more positive than expected
 - an early sign that QE can not only lower the cost of funding for corporates
 but also de facto improve confidence and activity in Europe in 2015.
Sector allocation detracted from performance in January; however, this was far
 outweighed by the strongly positive stock selection. As the Company had less
 exposure to oil & gas than the benchmark, it thus experienced a positive
 contribution to relative performance from this sector. The largest detracting
 sector was financials.
Despite being negative at the sector level, stock selection within financials
 was the strongest contributor in January. Avoiding holdings in numerous
 Eurozone banks, including Banco Santander, BNP Paribas and BBVA, contributed to
 performance as the banking sector in Europe fell in January with the
 announcement of Quantitative Easing by the European Central Bank. However, a
 holding in Nordea Bank performed well over the month. The bank's ability to
 deliver both strong dividend growth and a high dividend yield is proving
 increasingly attractive as yields compress elsewhere. Health care names
 Fresenius and Novo-Nordisk also contributed positively to performance, the
 latter rallying after receiving FDA approval for a key pipeline drug.
The Company saw detractions from holdings in Bank of Ireland and KBC Groep
 which were impacted by the ECB's announcement. Not holding Nestlé also
 detracted from performance as the stock's returns were driven up by the fall in
 CHF against the Euro this month.
At the end of the month, the Company had higher exposure to financials, health
 care, technology, consumer goods and consumer services. The Company had less
 exposure to oil & gas, basic materials, industrials and telecoms. The Company's
 exposure to utilities was in line with the benchmark.
Outlook
 After seven years of underperformance relative to the S&P, we believe that
 Europe has the potential to surprise on the upside this year. QE, a weaker Euro
 and low oil prices coupled with a stable global environment can finally lead to
 a steadily improving growth trend in Europe for the first time since the
 crisis. With continued low inflation and low interest rates, the risk premium
 on European equities has room to fall as investors are attracted back to the
 asset class. Coupled with earnings growth of around 10% and a dividend yield of
 3.5% there is good reason to anticipate a total return of over 15% for 2015.
 Markets might remain volatile though, which will open up potential
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 opportunities to pick up undervalued stocks across the market. Our consistent
 investment process and bottom-up fundamental analysis, coupled with internal
 valuation tools, should help us in such an environment.

 RYANAIR WELCOMES EU COURT RULING ON IRISH AIR TRAVEL TAX
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (5 Feb) welcomed the ruling of the EU General Court, which annulled the 
European Commission's 2012 decision ordering that Ryanair pays the Irish State EUR8 for every passenger who 
paid a EUR2 rate of the Air Travel Tax between 2009 and 2011.
 The Irish Air Travel Tax between 2009 and 2011 was set at EUR10 for flights departing Irish airports and landing 
more than 300km from Dublin Airport, and at EUR2 for flights departing Irish airports and landing less than 300km 
from Dublin Airport. The European Commission decided in 2012 that Ryanair, Aer Lingus and Aer Arann should pay 
the Irish State EUR8 in respect of each passenger who was subject to the EUR2 Air Travel Tax rate during that 
period.
 The EU General Court today annulled the European Commission's decision in this respect and found that the 
Commission erred in concluding that the "advantage" enjoyed by the airlines automatically amounted in all cases to 
EUR8.
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 "We welcome today's ruling which confirms that Ryanair is not required to pay the Irish State approx. EUR12 
million in respect of the Air Travel Tax paid at a lower (EUR2) rate between 2009 and 2011."

 RYANAIR REPORTS Q3 PROFIT OF EUR49M: GUIDANCE RISES TO EUR840M-EUR850M     ANNOUNCES EUR400M SHARE BUY-
BACK PROGRAMME STARTING IN FEBRUARY.
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline today (2 Feb) announced a Q3 net profit of EUR49m (compared 
to p.y. Q3 loss of EUR35m).  Traffic grew 14% to 21m customers as ave fare rose 2% to EUR40.  Revenues 
grew 17% to EUR1,132m while unit costs fell 6% (ex-fuel flat).  Load Factors rose 6% points from 82% to 
88% thanks to the continuing success of Ryanair's "Always Getting Better" customer programme and its 
significantly expanded winter schedule.

Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
 "As 2015 will be Ryanair's 30(th) year of bringing low fares to Europe, we are pleased to report a Q3 
profit of EUR49m.  These strong results confirm that our "Always Getting Better" customer programme and 
our expanded business schedules, coupled with our substantial fare and cost advantage over competitor 
airlines is drawing millions of new customers to Ryanair.
 Key milestones in the 3(rd) quarter include:
 --    Net profit EUR49m, (up EUR84m from p.y. Q3 loss of EUR35m)
 --    Traffic up 14%, load factor up 6% points to 88%
 --    More primary airports and city pairs in expanded winter schedule
 --    Summer 2015 schedule loaded 2 months earlier
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
 --    US web site launched under our AGB programme.
 --    First 5 of 380 new B737-800 aircraft delivered
 Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry with gross cash of EUR4.1bn and a net cash 
balance of EUR447m.
 New Routes and Bases:
 Our new winter routes and bases are performing well.  Our significantly expanded winter schedule, which 
includes more primary airports, city pairs and business friendly frequencies has converted millions of new 
customers to flying Ryanair.  3 new bases in Bratislava, Copenhagen and Ponta Delgada (Azores) will open 
in March/April with the benefit of stronger than expected forward bookings as the Ryanair low fare brand 
is already well known in these countries.
 As our new aircraft delivery programme gathers pace, we are now able to capitalise on significant growth 
opportunities that are available to Ryanair's low fares across Europe.  Our New Routes team are meeting 
with existing and new airports to finalise allocations of our growing fleet for the winter 2015 schedule.  
As many primary airports suffer capacity and traffic cuts from Europe's flag carriers, the growth 
incentives being offered to Ryanair continue to improve.
 30(th) Birthday in 2015:
 May 2015 marks the 30(th) anniversary of Ryanair's first flight from Waterford to London Gatwick.  Over 
this 30 year period Ryanair has revolutionised air travel for European consumers/visitors by carrying over 
750m customers at our very low fares while encouraging a number of other imitators in Europe (although 
none of these have been able to match Ryanair's unique low prices).  We are Europe's original, and still 
its lowest fare airline.  Ryanair has grown to become Europe's largest international passenger airline and 
we now expect to carry 100m customers in 2015/16 becoming the first EU airline to ever carry over 100m 
customers in one year. 2015 will see a number of events and special promotional fares to celebrate the 
30(th) birthday of low fares in Europe.
 Always Getting Better Programme:
 2015 will also be the 2(nd) year of Ryanair's "Always Getting Better" programme, under which we continue 
to improve our customer experience and transform our mobile and digital platforms.  In January we opened a 
US web site (www.ryanair.com/us) making it simpler for millions of American visitors to explore Europe 
with Ryanair's low fares.  The next big upgrade of our mobile app is scheduled for April.  The Ryanair 
Labs team is now working to identify and deliver exciting new services for our customers, which will be 
rolled out during 2015.
 In October Amadeus became our latest GDS partner.  Ryanair's Business Plus service and our high frequency 
winter schedules between many of Europe's major business cities are now visible to travel agents and 
corporate travel departments across Europe, making it easier for business customers to substantially cut 
their travel budgets while enjoying the reliability of Ryanair's industry leading on-time performance and 
customer service.
 Hedging:
 We have taken advantage of recent dips in oil prices to further extend our fuel hedges into FY17.  We are 
90% hedged for FY15 at $95 pbl and FY16 at $92 pbl and are 35% hedged in FY17 at approx. $68 pbl.  Our US$ 
op-ex is 90% hedged at $1.33 in FY16, and 60% hedged at $1.21 in FY17.  If current rates continue this 
would deliver an indicative reduction in our fuel cost per passenger of approx. 8% in FY16 and approx. 16% 
in FY17.  Our capex programme is fully hedged to September 2017 at a rate of $1.35, which locks in 
significantly lower cost aircraft deliveries over the next 2 years.
 Shareholder Returns:
 A EUR520m special dividend (EUR0.375 per share) will be paid on 27 February.  The shares go "ex-dividend" 
on 12 February.  The dividend timetable is available on ryanair.com.
 In light of our improved profitability and cash flows the Board has now approved a EUR400m share buy-back 
programme to commence on 12 Feb next.  This systemic programme will, subject to market conditions, be 
executed over a 6 month period from Feb to August 2015.
 IAG-Aer Lingus:
 We have noted the recent announcements made by both IAG and Aer Lingus on the subject of 3 proposals made 
by IAG to acquire Aer Lingus, and also the statement made by the Board of Aer Lingus plc "that the 
financial returns are at a level which it would be willing to recommend" subject to various conditions 
being met.
 Since Ryanair has received no formal approach, or offer for our shares in Aer Lingus, we will not engage 
in any speculation about this proposal, other than to restate our position which is that the Board of 
Ryanair will carefully consider any such offer, should one be received, from IAG or any other party, in 
due course.
 Full Year Guidance:
 As previously guided full year traffic will rise to just over 90m as load factors rise to 87%.  Q4 
traffic is expected to grow approx. 25% but ave fares will fall by -6% to -8% as we use lower fares to 
expand our network and develop our business schedules.  We have noticed a softening in prices for forward 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
bookings during the first weeks of January.  FY unit costs will fall by 5% due to lower oil prices (on our 
unhedged 10%) and these stronger load factors.  As a result we are raising our FY net profit guidance (was 
EUR810m-EUR830m) to a range of EUR840m-EUR850m.
 Cautionary Outlook:
 We would counsel shareholders and analysts to temper expectations for FY16.  While we are still 
finalising our budget, we believe that any growth in profits will be modest as our fuel is hedged at $92 
pbl whereas some competitors (whose weak balance sheets rendered them unable to hedge forward) will be 
significant beneficiaries of lower oil prices and this may lead to downward pressure on airfares in 
2015/16.  Ryanair's over-riding strategy remains, to be "load factor active - yield passive" so it is 
important that analysts are mindful of this likely increased price competition when revising their 
forecasts.  As lower oil prices kick in over the next two years, Ryanair intends to pass on much, if not 
all, of these savings to our rapidly growing customer base in the form of lower fares and therefore our 
profit growth expectations will be modest in FY16."

13.     Share buy-back
 There were no share buy-backs in the period.  In the period ended December 30, 2013, the Company bought 
back 59.6m ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR413.9m.  This was equivalent to approximately 4.2% of the 
Company's issued share capital.  All ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled.  Accordingly, share 
capital decreased by 59.6m ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.4m and the capital redemption 
reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.4m.  The capital redemption reserve is required to be created 
under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 14.     Eurobond
 In June 2014, Ryanair issued a 7 year unsecured eurobond, under its EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) 
programme, with a fixed coupon of 1.875% per annum and a notional principal of EUR850.0m. The issue price 
on the bond was 99.52%.
 15.     Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the period ended December 31, 2014 that materially affected 
the financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in 
the related party transactions described in the 2014 Annual Report that could have a material effect on 
the financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
 In October 2014, Michael O'Leary (Chief Executive Officer) signed a new 5 year contract which commits him 
to the Company until September 2019. This new contract replaces a rolling 12 month arrangement under which 
Mr O'Leary has worked as Chief Executive of the airline since Ryanair Holdings Plc first floated in 1997.

 Aircraft rental costs decreased by 1% to EUR24.4m due to a lower number of leased aircraft (Dec 31, 2014: 
51) compared to the prior year (Dec 31, 2013: 53).
 Due to the reasons outlined above operating profits are EUR71.6m compared to an operating loss of 
EUR23.0m in the comparative quarter.
 Finance expense decreased by 4% to EUR19.9m due to lower interest rates.
 Finance income remained relatively flat at EUR2.1m due to the higher cash balance offset by lower 
interest rates.

 Ryanair Holdings plc
 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
 1.                   Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the nine months ended December 31, 2014 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the interim financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2014 Annual Report for the year, ended March 31, 2014, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2014, are available at www.ryanair.com.
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2014 do not constitute statutory financial 
statements of the Group within the meaning of Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group 
Accounts) Regulations, 1992.  The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 
31, 2014, together with the independent auditor's report thereon, have been filed with the Irish Registrar 
of Companies following the Company's Annual General Meeting and are also available on the Company's 
Website.  The auditor's report on those financial statements was unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the interim 
financial statements for the nine month period ended December 31, 2014 on January 30, 2015.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
 The following new and amended standards, that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB), and are effective under those standards for the first time for the financial year beginning 
on or after January 1, 2014, and have also been endorsed by the EU, have been applied by the Group for the 
first time in these interim consolidated financial statements;
 --      IAS 32 (amendment) "Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IAS 39 (amendment) "Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IFRIC 21 "Levies" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IAS 36 (amendment) "Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets" (effective for 
fiscal period beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations in the period ended December 31, 2014.
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations which have not yet been endorsed by 
the EU will be adopted for purposes of the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable. 
We do not anticipate that the adoption of these new or revised standards and interpretations will have a 
material impact on our financial position or results from operations.
 --      Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (Amendments to IAS 19) (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after July 1, 2014).
 --      IFRS 9, "Financial Instruments" (2014) (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2018).
 --      "Annual Improvements to IFRSs". 2010-2012 Cycle (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after July 1, 2014).
 --      "Annual Improvements to IFRSs". 2011-2013 Cycle (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after July 1, 2014).
 --      "Annual Improvements to IFRSs". 2012-2014 Cycle (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after July 1, 2016).

associate/joint venture (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016).
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -6-
 --      Amendments to IFRS 11: "Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations" (effective 
for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016).
 --      IFRS 14, "Regulators Deferral Accounts" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2016).
 --      Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: "Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and 
Amortisation" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016).
 --      IAS 15, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2017).
 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.                   Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.       Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the period ended December 31, 
2014 was 12.3% (December 31, 2013: 11.9%).  The tax charge for the period ended December 31, 2014 of 
EUR117.9m (December 31, 2013: EUR76.9m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary 
differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in the income statement.
 5.                   Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.
 The Company granted options over 15 million shares in the period, under the terms of the 2013 Share 
Option Scheme approved by the Shareholders at the AGM on September 20, 2013 ("Option Plan 2013"). The fair 
value of these options is being recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee 
services rendered.

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the nine months ended December 31, 2014
 Profit after tax increased by 49% to EUR843.9m primarily due to a 4% increase in average fares and a stronger 
load factor (up 4 points to 88%), partially offset by a 4% increase in total operating expenses.  Total operating 
revenues increased by 11% to EUR4,669.6m, primarily due to a 12% increase in scheduled revenues to 
EUR3,632.0m, driven by the 4% increase in average fare, aided by the timing of Easter in the first quarter and its 
absence in the prior year comparative, along with a 4 percentage point increase in load factor.  Ancillary revenues 
rose by 8%, ahead of the growth in passenger numbers, to EUR1,037.6m.  Fuel, which represents 44% of total 
operating costs in the current period and 47% in the comparative period, decreased by 2% to EUR1,623.4m due to 
a lower euro price per gallon paid.  Unit costs excluding fuel rose by 2%, however, including fuel unit costs fell by 
3%.  Operating margin, as a result of the above, increased by 5 points to 22% whilst operating profit increased by 
45% to EUR1,005.0m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 11% to EUR4,669.6m primarily due to (i) a 4% increase in average fare, (ii) 
a 7% increase in traffic to 72.1m and strong load factor (88%), (iii) the timing of Easter in the first quarter and its 
absence in the prior year comparative and (iv) the strength of sterling to the euro. Ancillary revenues increased by 
8%, ahead of the 7% increase in passenger numbers.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 3%, primarily due to the strong growth in scheduled revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 12% to EUR3,632.0m due to a 4% rise in average fares, partially due 
to the timing of Easter and its absence in the prior year comparative, along with strong load factors and the strength 
of sterling to the euro. Load factor rose by 4 points to 88%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 8% to EUR1,037.6m, ahead of the 7% increase in passenger numbers.
 Total operating expenses increased by 4% to EUR3,664.6m due to the increased costs associated with the growth 
of the airline offset by a 2% reduction in fuel costs.
 Fuel & oil costs decreased by 2% to EUR1,623.4m due to a lower euro fuel price per gallon in the period.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 14%, as expected, to EUR573.4m, due to the mix of new routes and 
bases launched at primary airports, a 7% increase in passenger numbers and the strengthening of sterling against 
the euro.
 Route charges increased by 2% to EUR438.4m in line with the increase in sectors flown.
 Staff costs increased by 5% to EUR380.6m due to the increased level of activity, the impact of a 2% pay increase 
granted in April 2014, and the strength of sterling to the euro.
 Depreciation increased by 7% to EUR287.7m due to 5 aircraft deliveries, the purchase of 10 spare engines in the 
period, and the higher level of maintenance activity during the period.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs, which include ancillary costs, increased by 22% to EUR180.5m, mainly due to 
higher marketing spend to support Ryanair's "Always Getting Better" customer programme and the launch of new 
routes and bases.
 Maintenance costs increased by 15% to EUR95.6m, primarily due to the inclusion in the prior year comparative of 
a one off credit of EUR3.7m arising from the renegotiation of certain maintenance contracts. The remainder of the 
increase is due to line maintenance costs resulting from the launch of new bases and unscheduled maintenance 
costs.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 10% to EUR85.0m, reflecting short term leases over the summer, offset by a 
lower number of leased aircraft in the period (Dec 31, 2014: 51) compared to the prior year (Dec 31, 2013: 53).
 Operating margin increased by 5 points to 22% due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits have 
increased by 45% to EUR1,005.0m.
 Finance expense decreased by 9% to EUR57.7m due to lower interest rates.
 Finance income increased by 5% to EUR14.9m primarily due to higher cash.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR879.2m since March 31, 2014 to EUR4,120.9m and Gross debt rose by EUR590.4m 
to EUR3,674.0m.  The Group generated EUR822.5m cash from operating activities and approximately EUR846.0m 
from its debut Eurobond issuance in June 2014 (see note 14). This funded net capital expenditure of EUR507.7m 
and debt repayments of EUR293.6m. As a result the Group's Net cash position was EUR446.9m at the period end 
(March 31, 2014: EUR158.1m).
 Shareholders' equity increased by EUR763.5m to EUR4,049.3m in the period due to the net profit after tax of 
EUR843.9m and the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for derivatives and changes in unrealised gains on 
available for sale financial assets.
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended December 31, 2014
 The Group had a Profit after tax of EUR48.9m compared to a loss after tax of EUR35.2m in the comparative 
period, primarily due to a stronger load factor (up 6 points to 88%) and a 2% increase in average fares, partially 
offset by a 7% increase in total operating expenses.  Total operating revenues increased by 17% to EUR1,132.2m, 
primarily due to a 17% increase in scheduled revenues to EUR835.9m, driven by a strong load factor and a 2% 
increase in average fare.  Ancillary revenue was up 19%, ahead of the growth in traffic, to EUR296.3m.  Fuel, which 
represents 43% of total operating costs in the current quarter and 46% in the comparative quarter, decreased by 
1% to EUR451.9m due to a lower euro price per gallon paid.  Unit costs excluding fuel remained flat, however, 
including fuel unit costs fell by 6%.  As a result of the above, there was an operating profit of EUR71.6m compared 
to an operation loss of EUR23.0m in the comparative quarter.
 Total operating revenues increased by 17% to EUR1,132.2m primarily due to a 14% increase in traffic to 20.8m, a 
2% increase in average fare and the stronger sterling against the euro.  Ancillary revenues grew by 19%, ahead of 
the 14% increase in passenger numbers.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 3%, due to the strong growth in both scheduled and ancillary revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 17% to EUR835.9m due to a 2% rise in average fares, strong load 
factors and the strength of sterling to the euro. Load factor rose by 6 points to 88%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 19% to EUR296.3m, faster than the 14% increase in passenger numbers, due to a 
combination of an improved product mix, the roll out of reserved seating across the network, the early release of the 
2015 summer schedule which increased administration and credit card fees and the strength of sterling to the euro.
 Total operating expenses increased by 7% to EUR1,060.6m due to the increased costs associated with the growth 
of the airline offset by a 1% reduction in fuel costs.
 Fuel & oil costs decreased by 1% to EUR451.9m due to a lower euro fuel price per gallon in the quarter.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 23%, as expected, to EUR165.8m due to the mix of new routes and bases 
launched at primary airports as part of the expanded winter schedule, a 14% increase in passenger numbers and 
the strengthening of sterling against the euro.
 Route charges increased by EUR13.7m to EUR123.0m as the number of sectors flown increased, and sterling 
strengthened against the euro.
 Staff costs increased by 10% to EUR115.6m due to the increased level of activity, a 2% pay increase granted in 
April 2014 and the strengthening of the sterling against the euro.
 Depreciation increased by 8% to EUR92.6m due to the delivery of 3 new aircraft in the period and the higher level 
of maintenance activity during the quarter.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs, which include ancillary costs, increased by 29% to EUR56.6m, due to higher 
marketing spend to support Ryanair's "Always Getting Better" customer programme and the launch of new routes 
and bases.
 Maintenance costs increased by 6% to EUR30.7m in line with the increase in the flight hours.

 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -7-
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.

 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the period to December, 2014 amounted to EUR507.7m and primarily relates to

 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management
 We are exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. Our financial risk 
exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The 
Company uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2014 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --   Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
Group can access at the measurement date.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -7-
 --   Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --   Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Company's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --   Available for sale: The fair value of available for sale financial assets is their quoted market bid 
price at the balance sheet date. (Level 1)
 --   Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --   Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of the 
contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at December 31, 2014 has 
been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the period to December 31, 2014, there 
were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --   Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at December 31, 2014 to arrive 
at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the period to December 
31, 2014 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.

 Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus" or the "Company")
 ISE: EIL1                    LSE: AERL
 Possible Offer Update
 On 26 January 2015, the Board of Directors of Aer Lingus (the "Board") announced that it had received a 
revised proposal from International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. ("IAG") which values each Aer Lingus 
share at EUR2.55 comprising an all cash offer for the Company of EUR2.50 per share and a cash dividend of 
EUR0.05 per share (the "Revised Proposal"). The Revised Proposal remains conditional on, amongst other 
things, confirmatory due diligence, the recommendation of the Board of Aer Lingus and the receipt of 
irrevocable commitments from Ryanair Limited and the Minister for Finance of Ireland to accept the offer, 
all of which may be waived in whole or in part by IAG.
 IAG has indicated that it would only proceed with its third proposal with an indication from the Board of 
Aer Lingus that it would be willing to recommend the financial terms of the Revised Proposal.
 Having considered this request, the Board has indicated to IAG that the financial terms are at a level at 
which it would be willing to recommend, subject to being satisfied with the manner in which IAG proposes 
to address the interests of relevant parties.
 The Board notes IAG's intentions regarding the future of the Company, in particular that Aer Lingus would 
operate as a separate business with its own brand, management and operations, continuing to provide 
connectivity to Ireland, while benefitting from the scale of being part of the larger IAG group.
 This statement is being made by Aer Lingus with the consent of IAG. There can be no certainty that any 
offer will be made.

indirectly) in 1% or more of any class of "relevant securities" of Aer Lingus, all "dealings" in any "relevant securities"

Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
During the month, the Company's NAV returned -4.9% and the share price returned
 -2.4%. For reference, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index returned -4.7% during
 the same period.
European markets fell in December, after a strong rally at the end of October
 and into November. Europe generally lagged the rest of the world (USA and Japan
 all posting positive December returns). Potential political risk has become
 apparent in Europe, the Syriza political party in Greece increasing the
 prospect of rejection of further reform. The energy sector once again was the
 worst performer during the month as oil prices fell further as Opec announced
 it will not cut production even if the price of oil falls to $20 a barrel,
 spelling out a dramatic policy shift that will have far-reaching implications
 for the global energy industry.
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
Sector allocation detracted from performance during December. In particular, a
 large underweight exposure to consumer goods had a negative impact on
 performance on a sector basis. The best performing sector was consumer
 services. The oil & gas sector also detracted; however, the affect on fund
 returns was muted slightly thanks to having a lower exposure to this sector.
 Stock selection marginally contributed to performance, with stock selection
 within the consumer goods and consumer services sector proving especially
 positive.
The best performing single holding over the period was Ryanair. The holding has
 rallied since the company increased its full-year net profit guidance by around
 20% after experiencing strong passenger growth in the latter half of the year.
 The firm has effectively revamped their offer to attract leisure customers back
 and is also starting to tackle the business market by offering an attractive
 priced business ticket with flexible fares. Additionally, Ryanair is a large
 beneficiary of the rapidly falling oil price as this is their single largest
 cost. Sound returns were also evident from two holdings in luxury goods,
 Luxottica and LVMH.
The Company experienced detractions from a number of emerging market banks,
 including Russia's Sberbank and Turkish banks Turkiye Halk Banka and T Garanti
 Bankasi. Sberbank underperformed in the wake of deteriorating sentiment towards
 Russia. The fall in the oil price has placed the Russian economy under pressure
 with both equities and the ruble falling as a result. Turkish banks Garanti and
 Halk also underperformed in December. Both stocks have enjoyed a strong year
 but suffered in the broader Emerging Markets sell-off during the month.
At the end of the month, the Company had higher exposure to health care,
 financials, technology, consumer services and industrials, and less exposure to
 consumer goods, basic materials, industrials and telecommunications. The
 Company was neutral weighted to oil & gas.
Outlook
 The Eurozone's growth prospects continue to weigh on sentiment towards European
 earnings. However, the sharp weakness in the Euro is improving the growth
 prospects of exporting companies. In addition, the lower oil price will help
 energy input costs for corporates and energy costs for households, which should
 contribute positively to the global economic momentum in terms of consumption.
 Along with favourable European Central Bank policy, these factors could have
 the ability to support the European equity market in 2015. It is worth noting
 though that 2015 could be another volatile year, given the uncertain outcome of
 the upcoming Greek elections, the dependence on supportive monetary policies in
 Europe and Japan, the need for more stimulative measures in China to avoid a
 hard-landing, the ongoing geo-political risks in Ukraine and the Middle-East,
 and the shift in monetary policy stance by the Federal Reserve expected in the
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 near term.

 positioning the portfolio for a particular macroeconomic scenario, we have been
 keen to build positions in companies with credible self-help potential. This is
 the rationale behind our recent purchases of Carnival, Burberry Group, Direct Line
 Insurance and Friends Life.
In the free cash flow portion of the portfolio the Company sold Vodafone, Tate
 & Lyle, National Grid and reduced the holding in Legal & General Group whilst
 in the growth portion the Company, sold Barclays, Hargreaves Lansdown, Ryanair
 and Betfair and reduced Dixons Carphone, 3I Group and Spectris.
Outlook/Strategy
While the outlook for the global economy has improved in recent years, it
 remains fragile. Eurozone economic activity remains subdued despite an
 increasingly supportive policy response from the European Central Bank, whilst
 in the US the ending of quantitative easing is contributing to uncertainty.
 We continue to focus more on the specific drivers of individual companies and
 the ability to determine their future rather than relying on a specific macro
 outcome. Given that the outlook for both economic growth and interest rates
 remains uncertain, we seek those companies that can drive returns through
 self-help and have a clear strategy to deploy the cash flow they generate.
The portfolio is primarily invested in high free cash flow companies that can
 sustain cash generation and pay a growing dividend, but also has exposure to

 companies with sustainable growth franchises and turnaround situations.

Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
During the month, the Company's NAV rose 5.4% and the share price increased by
 5.1%. For reference, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index rose 5.8% during the
 same period (all returns in sterling terms with income reinvested).
European markets rose in November, continuing the strong rally seen in the
 second half of October. The oil & gas sector significantly underperformed in
 the month as the oil price continued to fall; this was exacerbated by OPEC's
 decision not to cut supply at the end of the month. At the European Central
 Bank, Draghi continued to bolster market confidence by stating that "other
 unconventional measures might entail the purchase of... sovereign bonds", thereby
 boosting expectations of full-scale Quantitative Easing in Europe in the near
 future. Economically, data for Europe was mixed; despite data showing a slow in
 manufacturing in Germany last month, a business confidence survey of 7,000
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 cross-industry firms in the country rose month-on-month.
Sector allocation detracted from performance during November. In particular, a
 large underweight exposure to consumer goods had a negative impact on
 performance on a sector basis. The best performing sector was consumer
 services. Stock selection also had a marginal detraction on performance, with
 stock selection within the basic materials sector performing the worst.
Russian chemicals company Uralkali was the worst performing position this
 month after the share price fell sharply when the company announced it had to
 suspend production at Solikamsk-2 mine for safety purposes. A number of
 financial stocks, such as Unicredit and Nordea, detracted from performance
 after posting disappointing Q3 results. The Company was not heavily affected by
 the falling oil price, with only one position within this industry, Lundin
 Petroleum, detracting from returns. Not holding benchmark constituent Statoil,
 which suffered a 14% fall during the month, contributed positively to
 performance.
Sector allocation to telecoms also marginally detracted from performance;
 however, this was far outweighed by the positive contributions coming from
 stock selection within the sector. Specifically, a large active holding in
 Deutsche Telekom contributed to the Company's return after reporting solid Q3
 results. Within the consumer services industry, Ryanair performed particularly
 strongly, reporting results 10% ahead of consensus. The company has enjoyed
 strong passenger growth which has driven their market share higher, resulting
 in a lift to net income predictions for 2015.
At the end of the month, the Company had higher exposure to health care,
 financials, technology, consumer services and industrials, and less exposure to
 consumer goods, basic materials, utilities and telecommunications. The Company
 had a neutral exposure to oil & gas.
Outlook
 The European economic recovery has weakened in recent months, despite an
 increasingly aggressive European Central Bank (ECB) in terms of monetary
 stimulus. However, we remain of the view that Europe is not heading towards a
 triple-dip recession; we believe that we are in a period of gentle albeit muted
 European recovery. Recent policy measures at the ECB are coming into force
 throughout the fourth quarter and latest evidence suggests that the
 transmission mechanisms into the economy are improving. Going forward, it is
 important to note that the rapidly falling oil price should lead to a lower
 energy cost for corporates and households, which should contribute positively
 to the global economic momentum both in terms of consumption and in terms of
 corporate profits.

 TAX FREE FLIGHTS FOR ALL UK KIDS FLYING RYANAIR THIS EASTER
 RYANAIR TO REFUND CHILDREN'S APD ON UK FLIGHTS FROM 27 MARCH 2015
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (5 Dec) confirmed that it will refund the GBP13 UK travel tax for all 
children (under-12) who check-in on flights departing the UK from 1(st) May 2015, following the decision of UK 
Chancellor George Osborne to abolish children's APD from 1(st) May next.
 However, Ryanair announced that it will go even further than Chancellor Osborne and refund children's APD on UK 
flights for the six weeks from 27(th) March 2015, earlier than any other airline (or Chancellor Osborne), thereby 
allowing children to fly from the UK tax free for the Easter holidays so that British families can make even greater 
savings on their Easter breaks, as part of Ryanair's "Family Extra" service.
 Refunding this UK APD for kids over the Easter Holiday period will cost Ryanair up to GBP2m, and is the latest in a 
series of customer experience improvements under Ryanair's "Always Getting Better" programme, which includes a 
new website, a new mobile app (with boarding passes), and the new "Family Extra" and "Business Plus" services, 
as Ryanair continues to deliver so much more than just the lowest fares.
 Ryanair's Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs, said:
 "Ryanair welcomes Chancellor Osborne's decision to scrap APD for children under-12 on flights departing the UK 
from 1(st) May 2015. To ensure even greater savings for the millions of UK families flying Ryanair at Easter, 
Ryanair will refund APD for all children who check in on flights departing the UK from 27(th) March 2015 onwards. 
Families flying Ryanair already enjoy the lowest fares and fantastic discounts with our "Family Extra" service and 
this will ensure even more UK families make even greater savings next Easter flying with Ryanair.
 While we welcome this partial reduction in APD, we call on the UK Government to abolish APD, and allow UK 
tourism to return to growth and become competitive once more. Tourist traffic in Ireland has risen by almost 10% 
Ryanair Holdings PLC TAX FREE FLIGHTS FOR UK KIDS ON RYANAIR AT EASTER
since APD was abolished in April, with the VAT received from the additional tourist spend far exceeding the loss of 
APD. The UK should follow suit and axe the tax for all."

 RYANAIR NOVEMBER TRAFFIC JUMPS 22% TO 6.35M CUSTOMERS
 FULL YEAR TRAFFIC & PROFIT GUIDANCE RAISED AS THE "ALWAYS GETTING BETTER" PROGRAMME DELIVERS STRONGER 
THAN EXPECTED GROWTH IN FIRST MONTH OF EXPANDED WINTER 14/15 SCHEDULE
 Ryanair Europe's favourite airline, today (4 Dec) released November traffic growth highlighting that the 
airline's "Always Getting Better" customer programme delivered a stronger than expected performance in the 
first month of Ryanair's significantly expanded winter schedule. Despite increasing November seat capacity 
by 13% (over Nov 13) and opening a large number of new city pair routes designed to appeal to business 
traffic, Ryanair's November load factor rose by 7% points from 81% in 2013 to 88% in 2014.
 Ryanair noted that it had materially exceeded its first month load factor targets across a significant 
number of city pair markets where it is offering business type frequencies in direct competition to longer 
established, higher fare airlines as the following examples illustrate:
 --    From Dublin on 3 new routes to Brussels (3 daily), Glasgow (3) and Cologne (1) in competition with 
Aer Lingus, the first month load factor was 80%.
 --    From Warsaw (Modlin) to Gdansk (2 daily) and Wroclaw (2) in competition with LOT, the first month 
load factor was 82%.
 --    From London Stansted to Glasgow (3 daily), Edinburgh (3), Lisbon (3), Cologne (2) and Athens in 
competition with easyJet, the first month load factor was 88%.
 --    From Lisbon to London (3 daily), Hamburg (1), Rome (1) and Milan (1) in competition with TAP and 
others, the first month load factor was 90%.
 Ryanair attributes this stronger than expected initial winter performance to the continuing success of 
its "Always Getting Better" customer programme, our stronger forward booking strategy and the airline's 
substantial fare and unit cost advantage over all other European airlines.
 As a result of this better than expected performance in month one, of its substantially expanded winter 
schedule, Ryanair has now revised its full year traffic guidance up from 89m to just over 90m customers, 
and raised its full year profit after-tax forecast from its previous range of EUR750m to EUR770m, to a new 
range of EUR810m to EUR830m.  Ryanair noted that the final full year profit will still be heavily reliant 
on close in bookings and yields in Q4 (Jan - Mar 15) over which it presently has very little visibility.

 RYANAIR SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE BOEING 737 "GAMECHANGER" ORDER AT EGM
 99.93% VOTE IN FAVOUR OF NEW 200 AIRCRAFT ORDER
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (28 Nov) announced that its order to purchase up to 200 Boeing 
"gamechanger" 737 MAX aircraft (100 firm & 100 options)  has been approved by 99.93% of shareholders who 
voted at its EGM in Dublin this morning. When finalised (and if all options are exercised) this deal will 
be valued at over $22bn at current list prices.
 Ryanair is the lead customer for this new Boeing aircraft which will feature 197 seats (8 more than 
Ryanair's existing 737-800s), more leg room, new Boeing Sky Interiors, and CFM LEAP-1B engines, which will 
reduce fuel consumption by up to 18% in Ryanair's configuration and reduce noise emissions by 40%.
 These aircraft will further reduce Ryanair's industry leading unit costs, and these savings will be 
passed on via lower fares to Ryanair's customers, which will now grow from 82m in 2014 to over 150m 
customers p.a. by the end of the delivery stream in FY2024.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair is proud and honoured to become the lead operator of Boeing's 737 "gamechanger" aircraft. This 
order will expand our fleet to approx 520 aircraft by 2024 and create another 10,000 new jobs for pilots, 
cabin crew and engineers in Europe, while allowing us to grow our traffic to over 150m p.a.
 These new "gamechanger" aircraft will allow Ryanair to lower our costs and airfares, while improving our 
customer experience with more leg room and Boeing Sky Interiors, as part of our "Always Getting Better" 
customer experience improvement programme.
 We wish to sincerely thank our Board and shareholders for their overwhelming support for this new 
"gamechanger" aircraft order."

 RYANAIR WELCOMES IRISH SUPREME COURT RULING ON SCREENSCRAPER WEBSITES
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (20 Nov) welcomed an Irish Supreme Court ruling that legal 
cases taken by Ryanair against screenscraper websites must be heard in Ireland. Ryanair has been engaged in 
various cases across Europe to prevent customers from being subjected to excessive charges and poor travel 
experiences as they didn't book directly.
 Screenscrapers such as eDreams, Billigfluege, On The Beach and Ticketpoint sell Ryanair flights without 
transferring the customer to the Ryanair website at any stage of the booking process. Billigfluege, On the Beach 
and Ticketpoint sought to overturn previous High Court decisions regarding jurisdiction. However, this argument 
was dismissed by the Supreme Court.
 Ryanair has called on these screenscrapers such as eDreams, Billigfluege, On The Beach and Ticketpoint to stop 
misleading customers with artificially low on-screen flight prices which bear no relation to the total amount that 
customers end up paying. Ryanair has again identified more cases of these websites offering low-fare flights only 
for these to end up costing substantially more than the actual fares on Ryanair.com:
Route             Travel Date   Ryanair      Screenscraper
 -------------------------  ------------  ---------  ------------------
 Dublin - London Stansted    Jan 2015     EUR19.99    eDreams EUR44.69
 -------------------------  ------------  ---------  ------------------
 Dublin - Frankfurt          Mar 2015     EUR42.99      Billigfluege
 Hahn                                                    EUR58.84
 -------------------------  ------------  ---------  ------------------
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR WELCOMES RULING ON SCREENSCRAPER WEBSITES
Many of these websites continue to cause problems for Ryanair customers and/or fail/refuse to pass on 
vital information to both customers and Ryanair regarding issues such as flight changes, web check-in, 
special needs assistance and contact details, which has resulted in missed flights and repeated problems 
for customers.
 Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "We welcome this ruling of the Irish Supreme Court which confirms that Ryanair's legal cases against 
screenscraper websites must be heard in Ireland. The ruling will have no impact on the authorised websites 
we work with today, over a dozen, who are supplied with Ryanair's product inventory, so as to allow 
customers to compare airfares. However, many screenscraper sites continue to artificially inflate 
Ryanair's fares and give a bad experience to customers, particularly those that want to change an element 
of their booking. We are calling on the EU to intervene and prohibit these practices in the interest of 
consumers."

Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
During the month, the Company's NAV fell by 0.5% and the share price fell by
 0.2%. For reference, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index fell 1.4% during the
 same period (all returns in sterling terms with income reinvested).
European equity markets fell in October. Unlike in recent months, large caps
 underperformed small and mid-caps. European equity markets performed worse than
 other developed markets: the US gained 3.2% (Euro terms) and World Equities
 gained 1.5% (Euro terms). October also proved to be a volatile month: the
 market fell 9.6% by 16 October before recovering later in the month. At the
 beginning of the month, a disappointing European Central Bank (ECB) council
 meeting (no significant policy action announced) combined with further falls in
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 the oil price initially caused concern and business confidence indicators in
 the Eurozone were worse than expected. Later in the month, however,
 announcements in the third quarter reporting season for companies proved
 positive. On a sector basis, oil & gas underperformed on the back of a
 weakening oil price.
Stock selection drove performance during October, while the Company's sector
 allocation detracted from returns. A lower weight in consumer goods when
 compared with the market hindered returns overall.
Stock selection in health care was especially profitable. A position in
 Fresenius, the German based health care group, supported returns as the group
 reported earnings that were better than expected for the third quarter. In
 addition, avoiding holding Sanofi, which reported poorer than expected Q3
 results and as the company has suffered from rumored changes to their CEO,
 contributed strongly to returns. In industrials, a position in Geberit, a Swiss
 manufacturing company, rallied from mid-month on the news of their acquisition
 of Sanitec, which will bolster their growth potential and visibility. Finally,
 two holdings in Turkish banks performed well during October.
Holdings in Italian companies proved less successful. ENI fell on the back of
 the underperformance of the oil & gas sector. In financials, Italian asset
 management group Anima Holding and Banca Popolare di Milano also detracted. The
 share price for Banca Popolare di Milano was volatile during the month and has
 fallen off in the wake of the AQR, which highlighted a capital deficiency at
 the end of 2013.  However, adjusted for capital raised in 2014, the bank was
 deemed to hold sufficient levels and remains attractive in the long term. On a
 positive note, not holding KBC contributed to returns.
At the end of the month, the Company had higher exposure to health care,
 financials, technology and consumer services, and less exposure to consumer
 goods, basic materials, telecoms and utilities.
Outlook
 The European economic recovery has weakened in recent months, despite an
 increasingly aggressive ECB in terms of monetary stimulus. However, we remain
 of the view that Europe is not heading towards a triple-dip recession; we
 believe that we are in a period of gentle, albeit muted European recovery
 (implied by composite PMIs remaining in expansion territory), with economic
 momentum held back by the structural reforms and ongoing fiscal tightening.
 Recent policy measures at the ECB are coming into force throughout the fourth
 quarter and latest evidence suggests that the transmission mechanisms into the
 economy are improving, with ECB lending surveys continuing to show an increase
 in demand for credit from both corporates and households. With the AQR and
 stress tests on Eurozone banks now complete, the market has clarity on future
 bank capital needs, which should allow banks to fully exploit the ECB liquidity

 measures (TLTRO, ABS) from now on.

 --    Aer Lingus entered into a conditional agreement with the IASS Trustee dated 11 September 2014 and a 
memorandum of understanding with trade unions representing Aer Lingus staff dated 15 September 2014;
 --    Aer Lingus, DAA and the IASS Trustee commenced an extensive communications exercise for current and 
former employees on 24 September 2014. This exercise comprised detailed proposal guides, personal 
illustrations, information website and interactive question and answer sessions;
 --    A consultation period, during which IASS members could provide feedback to the IASS Trustee also 
commenced on 24 September 2014 and ended on 27 October 2014. The IASS Trustee will consider feedback 
received for a period which is expected to end on 15 November 2014; and
 --    Trade unions representing Aer Lingus staff have conducted a member ballot on the proposed IASS 
solution, the results of which are expected imminently.
 Despite the above steps, the implementation of the proposed IASS solution is a complex process and there 
remains a risk of unexpected delay or other unanticipated issues arising.
 Subject to a positive outcome of the trade union ballot, Aer Lingus expects to issue a circular to 
shareholders in mid-November 2014 setting out full details of the proposed IASS solution. This will be 
followed by the convening of an extraordinary general meeting in mid-December 2014 to seek approval from 
shareholders to make proposed once-off payments totaling EUR190.7 million relating to the proposed IASS 
solution. If shareholder approval is received, the benefit reductions proposed by the IASS trustee will 
still need to be approved by the Pensions Authority in order for the proposed IASS solution to be fully 
implemented.
 The proposed IASS solution does not relate to the Irish Airlines' (Pilots) Superannuation Scheme (the 
"Pilots' Scheme"). Aer Lingus has engaged in discussions regarding the Pilots' Scheme with the trustee of 
the Pilots Scheme and IALPA. These parties have signed a funding proposal for submission to the Pensions 
Authority and this funding proposal does not involve any capital contribution by Aer Lingus either within 
the Pilots' Scheme or outside of the Pilots' Scheme. The trustee of the Pilots' Scheme is awaiting the 
decision of the Pensions Authority regarding the funding proposal.

Ryanair's appeal in relation to the decision of the Competition Appeals Tribunal to the UK Court of Appeal will be

 RYANAIR HALF YEAR PROFITS RISE 32% TO EUR795M
 FULL YEAR TRAFFIC & PROFIT GUIDANCE RAISED.
 Ryanair Europe's favourite low fares airline today (Nov 3) announced that H1 Net Profit rose by 32% to EUR795m. 
Traffic grew 4% to 51.3m customers, ave. fares increased 5%, and total revenues rose by 9% to EUR3,537m.  Unit 
costs fell by 2% (excluding fuel they rose by 3%).  H1 load factors jumped by 4% points to 89%, due to a stronger 
Easter period and the success of Ryanair's "Always Getting Better" customer experience improvements.

Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
 "We are pleased to report this significant increase in H1 profits.  While partially due to the presence 
of Easter in Q1 and a weak prior year comparable, we have also enjoyed a strong summer thanks to our 
strategy (announced Sept. 2013), of raising forward bookings and improving our customer experience which 
has delivered higher load factors and yields.  We achieved a number of milestones during the half year 
including:
 --    H1 profits up 32% to EUR795m.
 --    Traffic up 4% to 51.3m (load factor up 4% points to 89%).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report
 --    Average H1 fare up 5% to EUR54.
 --    4 new bases and 57 new routes opened.
 --    Improved website and mobile app rolled out.
 --    "Always Getting Better" customer experience improving.
 --    "Family Extra" and "Business Plus" products launched.
 --    EUR850m 7yr Euro bond issued @ 1.875%.
 --    EUR520m special dividend in Feb 2015 approved.
 --    Launch order for 200 Boeing 737-MAX "Gamechanger" aircraft (sub. to EGM approval).
 --    Revised growth plan to double to 150m p.a. customers by 2024.
 The 5% rise in average fares and the 4% point increase in load factors has driven a 32% increase in H1 
profits and validates our "Always Getting Better" programme and higher forward booking strategy.  Our 
customers are finding it easier to locate and book our lowest fares on our improved website, while our new 
responsive mobile app has been downloaded more than 3m times in just 6 months.  The customer experience is 
also improving at every touch point from mobile booking, online check-in, a smoother boarding process, and 
a friendlier on-board service where customers are really enjoying allocated seating and using their PED's.
 Half year unit costs fell by 2%.  Excluding fuel they rose 3% mainly due to higher landing and handling 
costs at primary airports, and a higher marketing spend to support the "Always Getting Better" programme.  
H1 Ancillary revenue grew by 4% to EUR741m in line with traffic growth as airport and baggage fee 
reductions were offset by the increased uptake of
 allocated seating.
 Our "Always Getting Better" Program is Delivering.
 The success of our "Always Getting Better" programme is evidenced by our rising forward booking's profile 
which is continuing into the winter season despite a very substantial (16%) winter traffic growth.  As we 
enter November, forward bookings for Dec. to March continue to run on average 5% ahead of this time last 
year.
 We have been pleasantly surprised at the rapid uptake of our new Family and Business Plus products which 
are enabling Ryanair to win new customers from all our higher fare competitors.  We expect the uptake of 
our "Business Plus" service to build during our winter schedule which offers many more business routes 
to\from primary airports.  Price conscious and time sensitive business passengers are already switching to 
Ryanair for our industry leading punctuality, and the better travel experience which our "Business Plus" 
product delivers.
 Continuous Digital Development.
 The success of our improved website and mobile app has been validated by the significant surge in web 
visits across all major markets particularly the UK. This time last year Ryanair was just 3(rd) in the UK 
for airline website visits (running behind both British Airways and Easyjet) on the Hitwise website 
listings.  In the last 6 months we have overtaken both of these higher fare competitors to become the UK's 
number one airline website, and the gap between us and these higher fare competitors is widening.  Our 
newly established Ryanair Labs development team will roll out more innovative services and features on our 
website and mobile app on a continuous basis into 2015.
 New Route & Base Development.
 Our 4 new summer bases in Athens, Brussels, Lisbon and Rome have performed well with strong load factors, 
as customers at primary airports switch quickly to Ryanair's lower fares and industry leading punctuality.
 Forward bookings on our 4 new winter bases in Cologne, Gdansk, Glasgow and Warsaw are building quickly.  
We are very excited by Ryanair's re-entry into the 2 big UK domestic routes, Glasgow-London and Edinburgh-
London (where we offer 3 times daily business schedules) at fares which are 50% lower than those charged 
by Easyjet or British Airways.  We look forward to winning a significant share of the Scotland-London 
business market this winter.  We expect this performance to be mirrored in other domestic business routes 
where we offer double daily frequencies such as Porto-Lisbon, Gdansk-Warsaw, and Wroclaw-Warsaw.  We are 
making significant inroads in domestic Italy as Alitalia cuts short haul capacity.  Germany is also an 
area of significant opportunity as continuing shorthaul capacity cuts by Air Berlin and Lufthansa enables 
Ryanair to expand in primary airports including Cologne, Hamburg, and Berlin.  Last week we announced 
Copenhagen as our 70(th) base which opens in March 2015 and begins Ryanair's expansion in the high fare 
Scandinavian region after a number of years without capacity growth in that market.
 New Aircraft Order.
 In September, Ryanair celebrated 2 milestone events with Boeing. We took delivery of the 1(st) of 180 new 
Boeing 737-800 NG aircraft in Seattle. These new aircraft will enable Ryanair to deliver strong traffic 
and profit growth over the coming 5 years as we grow to over 114m passenger's p.a.  These new aircraft 
will allow us exploit the unfolding opportunities at many primary and secondary airports across Europe who 
are encouraging Ryanair to grow quickly at their airports as their incumbent carriers cut capacity.
 We also signed a new agreement to be the launch customer for 200 new Boeing 737-MAX 200 "Gamechanger" 
aircraft (100 firm and 100 options) which is subj. to EGM approval on 28(th) November next.  These 
aircraft have the potential to transform Ryanair's cost base while further improving our on-board customer 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report
experience.  They have 8 extra seats (197), more leg room, and Boeing's attractive "sky" interiors.  These 
extra seats will generate more revenue per flight while the CFM Leap-1B engines will deliver an 18% 
reduction in fuel unit costs.  When these aircraft deliver, between 2019 to 2024, they will significantly 
lower our unit costs enabling Ryanair to offer even more lower fares, which will underpin our ambitious 
growth targets.
 Fuel Hedging.
 We have taken advantage of recent oil price weakness to extend our fuel hedges to 90% for FY16, at 
approx. $93 per barrel.  In Euro terms this will result in a 2% reduction in unit fuel costs over the next 
12 months.  We will now look for opportunities to extend our fuel hedging programme into FY17 to lock in 
future cost savings. We have also extended our Capex programme to September 2017 at an average exchange 
rate of EUR/$1.35 which locks in substantially lower costs for the new aircraft deliveries.
 Shareholder Returns & Balance Sheet.
 Our September AGM approved the Board's proposal to return another EUR520m via a special dividend 
(EUR0.375 per ordinary share).  This will be paid at the end of February 2015, at a time when our cash 
balances are rising. This will bring to over EUR2.5bn the returns made by Ryanair to shareholders since 
2008.  Ryanair's balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry.  Despite EUR293m of Capex and 
debt repayments of EUR199m during H1, our Net Cash position has improved from EUR158m to EUR618m 
reflecting our profitable H1 trading.  Our BBB+ rating from S&P and Fitch enabled us to issue our first 
unsecured Eurobond at a coupon of 1.875% fixed for 7 years, which will further reduce our ownership and 
financing costs.
 Forward Guidance.
 Based on these solid H1 results, underpinned by strong forward bookings and rising load factors, we have 
significantly raised our winter capacity and traffic growth objectives.  Traffic will grow by 12% in Q3 
and by 20% in Q4, which are very ambitious targets during the weaker half of the year.  However, we 
believe it is time to capitalise upon the many opportunities available to us at both primary and secondary 
airports, to grow our route network and increase frequencies, in order to attract business traffic which 
tends to travel more during the winter period.

 As a result traffic in H2 will now rise by 16% or 5.3m customers (2.2m more than previously guided) although we 
still expect H2 fares to fall. With reasonable visibility in Q3 we expect traffic will grow 12%, while ave. fares will fall 
between -3% to -5% (slightly better than our previous -6% to -8% guidance).  In Q4, we plan to grow traffic by 20%, 
and expect fares will fall by -6% to -10%, (as we use lower fares to achieve our significantly higher traffic targets).  
Accordingly, we now expect full year traffic will grow by 9% to 89m customers, and ave. fares for FY15 to rise by 
just 1% to EUR47.  Unit costs (excluding fuel) will be positively impacted by this significant H2 traffic increase, and 
we now expect unit costs will be flat for FY15.  Including fuel, unit costs will fall 4% in FY15.
 As a result of these 2.2m additional H2 passengers and falling unit costs our full year net profit will significantly 
exceed our previous guidance (of EUR650m) to a new range of between EUR750m to EUR770m.  However, we 
caution that this raised guidance remains heavily reliant on the strength of close in bookings for the remainder of 
Q3, and in particular Q4 where we presently have very little visibility.
 While encouraged by the continuing strength of forward bookings, we would caution that close in bookings for the 
remainder of this winter will be subject to unforeseen events which always overhang our business, and so extreme 
caution rather than irrational exuberance should underpin any medium term forecasts.  As these strong H1 results 
and raised full year guidance demonstrate, our business model is performing well but much work remains to be 
done over the next 12 months to continue to develop and improve our "Always Getting Better" programme for the 
benefit of our customers, our people, and our shareholders".

2024. Ryanair currently has a team of more than 9,500 highly skilled aviation professionals, and has an industry 
leading 30-year safety record.

 Independent review report of KPMG to Ryanair Holdings plc
 Introduction
 We have been engaged by Ryanair Holdings plc ("the Company") to review the condensed consolidated interim 
financial statements for the six months ended September 30, 2014, which comprise the condensed 
consolidated interim balance sheet, the condensed consolidated interim income statement, the condensed 
consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, the condensed consolidated interim statement of 
cash flows, the condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in shareholders' equity and the 
related notes.  We have read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and 
considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information 
in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
 This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the 
Company in meeting the requirements of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the 
Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the UK's 
Financial Conduct Authority ("the UK FCA").  Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose.  To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached.
 Directors' responsibilities
 The half-yearly financial report, including the condensed consolidated interim financial statements 
contained therein, is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors.  The directors are 
responsible for preparing the interim report in accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) 
Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland and the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules of the UK FCA.
 As disclosed in note 1 - basis of preparation, the annual consolidated financial statements of the 
Company are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board and as adopted by the European Union ('EU').  The directors 
are responsible for ensuring that the condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this 
half-yearly financial report have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, "Interim Financial Reporting," 
as adopted by the EU.
 Our responsibility
 Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed consolidated interim 
financial statements in the half-yearly financial report, based on our review.
 Scope of review
 We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 
2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity issued 
by the Auditing Practices Board.  A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, 
primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other 
review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain 
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.  
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
 Conclusion
 Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 
September 30, 2014 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the 
EU, the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules of the Central 
Bank of Ireland and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the UK FCA.

 Route charges were down EUR2.4m to EUR160.9m as the number of sectors flown remained flat and average 
sector length reduced by 1%.
 Staff costs increased by 3% to EUR132.3m due to a 2% pay increase granted in April 2014 and the 
strengthening of the sterling against the euro.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 7% to EUR98.4m due to 10 additional spare engines purchased, 
the delivery of 2 new aircraft in the period, and the higher level of maintenance activity during the 
quarter.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs, which include ancillary costs, increased by 29% to EUR64.3m, due 
to higher marketing spend to support our "Always Getting Better" programme and the launch of new routes 
and bases.
 Maintenance costs increased by EUR5.6m, to EUR29.7m, primarily due to the timing of maintenance checks, 
some unscheduled maintenance incurred, and increased line maintenance costs arising from the launch of new 
bases.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by EUR8.1m primarily due to short term summer leases, offset by a lower 
number of operating leased aircraft (Sep 30, 2014: 51) compared to the prior year (Sep 30, 2013: 57).
 Operating margin increased by 2% points to 34% due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits 
have increased by 14% to EUR701.6m.
 Finance expense decreased by 11% to EUR18.8m due to lower interest rates on both floating rate debt and 
our new fixed rate bond.
 Finance income increased by 37% primarily due to higher cash balances and a slightly longer tenor on 
fixed term deposits.

 Ryanair Holdings plc
 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
 1.       Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the six months ended September 30, 2014 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the interim financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2014 Annual Report for the year, ended March 31, 2014, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2014, are available at www.ryanair.com.
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2014 do not constitute statutory financial 
statements of the Group within the meaning of Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group 
Accounts) Regulations, 1992.  The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 
31, 2014, together with the independent auditor's report thereon, have been filed with the Irish Registrar 
of Companies following the Company's Annual General Meeting and are also available on the Company's 
Website.  The auditor's report on those financial statements was unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the interim 
financial statements for the six month period ended September 30, 2014 on October 31, 2014.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
 The following new and amended standards, that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB), and are effective under those standards for the first time for the financial year beginning 
on or after January 1, 2014, and have also been endorsed by the EU, have been applied by the Group for the 
first time in these interim consolidated financial statements;
 --      IAS 32 (amendment) "Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IAS 39 (amendment) "Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IFRIC 21 "Levies" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IAS 36 (amendment) "Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets" (effective for 
fiscal period beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations in the half-year ended September 30, 2014.
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations which have not yet been endorsed by 
the EU will be adopted for purposes of the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable. 
We do not anticipate that the adoption of these new or revised standards and interpretations will have a 
material impact on our financial position or results from operations.

after
 January 1, 2017).
 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.       Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.       Income tax expense

13.     Share buy-back
 There were no share buy-backs in the period.  In the period ended September 30, 2013, the Company bought 
back 24.1m ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR176.6m.  This was equivalent to approximately 1.7% of the 
Company's issued share capital.  All ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled.  Accordingly, share 
capital decreased by 24.1m ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.2m and the capital redemption 
reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.2m.  The capital redemption reserve is required to be created 
under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the half-year ended September 30, 2014
 Profit after tax increased by 32% to EUR795.0m primarily due to a 5% increase in average fares and a stronger 
load factor (up 4 points to 89%), partially offset by a 3% increase in total operating expenses.  Total operating 
revenues increased by 9% to EUR3,537.4m, primarily due to a 10% increase in scheduled revenues to 
EUR2,796.1m, driven by the 5% increase in average fare, aided by the timing of Easter in the first quarter and its 
absence in the prior year comparative along with a 4% increase in load factor.  Ancillary revenues rose by 4%, in 
line with the growth in passenger numbers, to EUR741.3m.  Fuel, which represents 45% of total operating costs in 
the current period and 47% in the comparative period, decreased by 2% to EUR1,171.5m due to a lower euro price 
per gallon paid.  Unit costs excluding fuel rose by 3%, however, including fuel unit costs fell by 2%.  Operating 
margin, as a result of the above, increased by 4 points to 26% whilst operating profit increased by 30% to 
EUR933.4m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 9% to EUR3,537.4m primarily due to (i) a 5% increase in average fare, (ii) a 
4% increase in traffic to 51.3m, (iii) the timing of Easter in the first quarter and its absence in the prior year 
comparative, and (iv) the strength of sterling to the euro. Ancillary revenues grew in line with the increase in 
passenger numbers.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 4%, primarily due to the strong growth in scheduled revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 10% to EUR2,796.1m due to a 5% rise in average fares, partially due 
to the timing of Easter and its absence in the prior year comparative, along with strong load factors and the strength 
of sterling to the euro. Load factor rose by 4 points to 89%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 4% to EUR741.3m, in line with the increase in passenger numbers.
 Total operating expenses increased by 3% to EUR2,604.0m due to the increased costs associated with the growth 
of the airline offset by a 2% reduction in fuel costs.
 Fuel & oil costs decreased by 2% to EUR1,171.5m due to a lower euro fuel price per gallon in the period.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 11%, as expected, to EUR407.6m, due to the mix of new routes and 
bases launched at primary airports, a 4% increase in passenger numbers and the strengthening of sterling against 
the euro.
 Route charges decreased by 1% to EUR315.4m as the number of sectors flown remained flat and average sector 
length reduced by 1%.
 Staff costs increased by 2% to EUR265.0m in line with the 2% pay increase granted in April 2014.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 7% to EUR195.1m due to the purchase of 10 spare engines in the 
period, 2 aircraft deliveries and the higher level of maintenance activity during the period.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs, which include ancillary costs, increased by 20% to EUR123.9m, mainly due to 
higher marketing spend to support our "Always Getting Better" programme and the launch of new routes and bases.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -5-
 Maintenance costs increased by 20% to EUR64.9m, primarily due to the inclusion in the prior year comparative of 
a one off credit of EUR3.7m arising from the renegotiation of certain maintenance contracts. The remainder of the 
increase is due to higher line maintenance costs resulting from the launch of new bases and unscheduled 
maintenance costs.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by EUR8.0m to EUR60.6m, reflecting short term leases over the summer, offset by a 
lower number of operating leased aircraft in the period (Sep 30, 2014: 51) compared to the prior year (Sep 30, 
2013: 57).
 Operating margin increased by 4 points to 26% due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits have 
increased by 30% to EUR933.4m.
 Finance expense decreased by 12% to EUR37.8m due to lower interest rates on both existing floating rate debt 
and our new fixed rate bond.
 Finance income increased by 8% to EUR12.8m primarily due to higher cash balances and a slightly longer tenor 
on fixed term deposits.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR1,133.4m since March 31, 2014 to EUR4,375.1m and Gross debt rose by 
EUR673.1m to EUR3,756.7m.  The Group generated EUR774.6m cash from operating activities and approximately 
EUR846.0m from its debut Eurobond issuance in June 2014 (see note 14). This funded net capital expenditure of 
EUR292.6m and debt repayments of EUR199.4m. As a result the Group's Net cash position rose to EUR618.4m at 
the period end (March 31, 2014: EUR158.1m).
 Shareholders' equity increased by EUR939.6m to EUR4,225.4m in the period due to the net profit after tax of 
EUR795.0m and the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for derivatives and changes in unrealised losses on 
available for sale financial assets.
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended September 30, 2014
 Profit after tax increased by 14% to EUR598.2m primarily due to a stronger load factor (up 4 points to 91%) and a 
3% increase in average fares, partially offset by a 3% increase in total operating expenses.  Total operating 
revenues increased by 7% to EUR2,041.7m, primarily due to a 7% increase in scheduled revenues to 
EUR1,671.1m, driven by a strong load factor and a 3% increase in average fare.  Ancillary revenue was up 4%, in 
line with the growth in passenger numbers, to EUR370.6m.  Fuel, which represents 45% of total operating costs in 
the current quarter and 48% in the comparative quarter, decreased by 3% to EUR607.7m due to a lower euro price 
per gallon paid.  Unit costs excluding fuel rose by 4%, however, including fuel unit costs fell by 1%.  Operating 
margin, as a result of the above, increased by 2 points to 34% whilst operating profit increased by 14% to 
EUR701.6m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 7% to EUR2,041.7m primarily due to a 4% increase in traffic to 27.1m, 
boosted by a 3% increase in average fare and the strength of sterling against the euro.  Ancillary revenues grew in 
line with the increase in passenger numbers.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 2%, primarily due to the strong growth in scheduled revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 7% to EUR1,671.1m due to a 3% rise in average fares, strong load 
factors and the strength of sterling to the euro. Load factor rose by 4% points to 91%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 4% to EUR370.6m, in line with the 4% increase in passenger numbers.
 Total operating expenses increased by 3% to EUR1,340.1m due to the increased costs associated with the growth 
of the airline offset by a 3% reduction in fuel costs.
 Fuel & oil costs decreased by 3% to EUR607.7m due to a lower euro fuel price per gallon in the quarter.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 11%, as expected, to EUR212.5m due to the mix of new routes and bases 
launched at primary airports, a 4% increase in passenger numbers and the strengthening of sterling against the

Body
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the half-year ended September 
30, 2014 was 12.4% (September 30, 2013: 12.2%).  The tax charge for the half-year ended September 30, 2014 
of EUR112.5m (September 30, 2013: EUR83.5m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary 
differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in the income statement.
 5.       Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.
 The Company granted options over 10 million shares in the period, under the terms of the 2013 Share 
Option Scheme approved by the Shareholders at the AGM on September 20, 2013 ("Option Plan 2013"). The fair 
value of these options, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee 
services rendered, was fully offset by a credit in relation to options that lapsed during the period under 
Option Plan 2003.
 6.       Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.       Capital commitments
 At September 30, 2014 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 299 (2013: 301) Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.  
Following shareholder approval at an EGM on June 18, 2013, the Group has agreed to purchase 180 new Boeing 
737 800NG aircraft during the periods Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2019 of which 2 aircraft were delivered in 
September 2014.
 In September 2014, the Group agreed to purchase up to 200 (100 firm and 100 options purchases) Boeing 737 
Max 200 aircraft from The Boeing Corporation during the period Fiscal 2019 to Fiscal 2024. This agreement 
is subject to shareholder approval at an EGM on November 28, 2014.
 8.       Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR260.3m at March 31, 2014 to EUR226.1m at 
September 30, 2014 is comprised of a loss of EUR34.2m, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
reflecting the decrease in the Aer Lingus share price from approximately EUR1.64 per share at March 31, 
2014 to approximately EUR1.42 per share at September 30, 2014.
 9.       Analysis of operating segment
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -7-
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties.  The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

under the Company's share option schemes and the weighted average number of shares includes weighted 
average share options assumed to be converted of 3.8m (September 2013: 6.2m).
 11.     Property, plant and equipment
 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the period to September 30, 2014 amounted to EUR292.6m and primarily relate to 
aircraft pre delivery payments, the cost of 10 spare engines purchased and two aircraft deliveries.
 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -7-
 We are exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. Our financial risk 
exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The 
Company uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2014 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --   Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
Group can access at the measurement date.
 --   Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --   Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Company's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --   Available for sale: The fair value of available for sale financial assets is their quoted market bid 
price at the balance sheet date. (Level 1)
 --   Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --   Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of the 
contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at September 30, 2014 
has been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the period to September 30, 2014, there 
were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --   Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at September 30, 2014 to 
arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.

 24 October 2014
 RYANAIR CEO SIGNS 5 YEAR CONTRACT EXTENSION
 Ryanair Holdings Plc today (24 Oct) confirmed that CEO, Michael O'Leary, has signed a new 5 year contract 
which commits him to the company until September 2019. This new contract replaces a rolling 12 month 
arrangement under which Mr O'Leary has worked as Chief Executive of the airline since Ryanair Holdings Plc 
first floated in 1997.
 Mr O'Leary has been granted options over 5m ordinary shares, payable at current market prices. However 
these options will only vest if the airline delivers exceptional performance targets over the next 5 
years, which have been set by the Remuneration Committee. Ryanair expects to grow traffic over the next 5 
years by 50% from 81m last year to over 120m customers by 2019.
 Mr O'Leary has served as Chief Executive of Ryanair since the company floated on the NASDAQ in 1997. 
During that time, Ryanair's annual traffic has grown from 3m to over 80m customers p.a.

 RYANAIR WELCOMES EU CONFIRMATION THAT AIRPORT AGREEMENTS AT CHARLEROI, HAHN, ALGHERO AND VASTERAS COMPLY 
WITH STATE AID RULES
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (1 Oct) welcomed the EU Commission's confirmation that 
Ryanair's airport agreements at Brussels Charleroi, Frankfurt Hahn, Alghero and Stockholm Vasteras 
airports comply with the Market Economy Investor Principle and do not infringe the EU State aid rules.  
The Charleroi finding affirms the EU Court's December 2008 ruling and brings to an end this long-running 
case which the EU Commission first considered in 1999.  Today's rulings are consistent with the EU 
Commission's previous confirmation that Ryanair's airport agreements with Aarhus, Bratislava, Marseille, 
Niederrhein, Berlin Schönefeld and Tampere airports also comply with EU State aid rules.
 Ryanair noted the EU Commission's decision concerning Zweibrücken airport, where Ryanair ceased 
operations in 2009 having carried just 50k passengers.  All of Ryanair's airport arrangements comply with 
the EU State aid rules and Ryanair has therefore instructed its lawyers to appeal this ruling to the 
extent it alleges otherwise.
 Ryanair's Director of Legal & Regulatory Affairs, Juliusz Komorek, said:
 "Today's decisions confirm that Ryanair's airport agreements at Charleroi, Hahn, Alghero and Vasteras 
airports comply with the Market Economy Investor Principle and involve no State aid.  This follows seven 
earlier positive decisions at Aarhus, Bratislava, Charleroi (in 2008), Marseille, Niederrhein, Berlin 
Schönefeld and Tampere airports.
 Ryanair has to date carried over 136m passengers at the 10 airports where our commercial arrangements 
have been confirmed by the EU Commission and the EU Court to comply with EU law, compared to just 50k 
passengers at Zweibrücken airport where the Commission today suggested that the airport agreement did not 
comply with State aid rules.
 We remain committed to growing traffic from the current 87mppa to over 150mppa by 2024, in partnership 
with both private and public airports across Europe where all of our arrangements are arms-length 
commercial deals consistent with the EU Market Economy Investor Principle."

 TOTAL VOTING RIGHTS
 In conformity with Regulation 20 of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109 EC) Regulations 2007, Ryanair 
announces that as at 30 September 2014:
 Ryanair's issued share capital consists of 1,384,530,624 Ordinary Shares of nominal value EUR0.00635 each with 
voting rights. Ryanair does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury.  Therefore, the total number of voting rights in 
Ryanair is 1,384,530,624.
 The above figure may be used by shareholders as a denominator for the calculations by which they will determine 
if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, Ryanair under the Transparency 
(Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the Interim Transparency Rules of the Financial Regulator.

 RYANAIR RAISES TRAFFIC FORECAST & UPDATES PROFIT GUIDANCE AT AGM DUE TO IMPROVING 
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, held its 2014 AGM at its new Dublin offices in Swords today (25 Sep), during 
which the airline briefed shareholders on the continuing success of its improving customer experience, and the 
strong early uptake of its new Business Plus service.
 The continuing success of these 'Always Getting Better' initiatives has enabled Ryanair to raise its full year traffic 
forecast from 86m to 87m customers, and move its full year net profit towards the upper end of its (previously 
guided) EUR620m to EUR650m range.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Our customers and our shareholders have responded favourably to our improving customer experience, our better 
digital platform and the positive initial uptake of our Business Plus service. We now expect slightly stronger traffic 
growth in the winter schedule, as we open new bases in primary airports at Cologne, Gdansk, Glasgow and 
Warsaw Modlin, as well as significantly increasing flight frequencies and schedules from Dublin to UK cities, and 
from Dublin to European capitals.
 While still too early to be confident about H2 fares and yields, the continuing strength of our forward bookings and 
the improving customer experience leads us to cautiously raise our full year traffic forecast to 87m customers, and 
our full year profit guidance towards the upper end of our current EUR620m-EUR650m range.
 However, the full year profit outturn continues to be heavily dependent on H2 yields over which we have very little 
visibility at present. We will give an update on Q3 yield performance at our half year results announcement in early 
November."

 RYANAIR PARTNERS WITH AMADEUS GDS
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (24 Sep) announced a new GDS partnership with Amadeus, 
Europe's leading provider of advanced technology solutions for the global travel industry, allowing Amadeus-
affiliated travel agents across Europe access to Ryanair's low fares and Europe's largest route network.
 The combination of Ryanair's low fares, extensive route network at primary and secondary airports, and leading 
market share in most of Europe's major travel markets, and Amadeus' technology, will enable Ryanair to further 
improve its business travel offering. This partnership (Ryanair's second GDS agreement) follows the August launch 
of Ryanair Business Plus and a dedicated corporate and groups service, which will allow even more businesses 
access to Ryanair's low fares, saving European companies millions in travel expenses every year.
 This is the latest in an on-going programme of Ryanair customer improvements, including the launch of the new 
Ryanair website, a new app with mobile boarding passes, allocated seating, a second carry-on bag allowance and 
a dedicated family service, Family Extra, as Ryanair continues to offer so much more than just the lowest fares.
 In Cologne, Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair is pleased to partner with Amadeus whose technology represents a significant opportunity for us to reach 
a wider range of business and corporate customers. With more than 27% of our customers already travelling on 
business, we are continuing to improve Europe's best business service, with the lowest fares, most on-time flights 
and our tailored Business Plus service. For business travellers, corporations and TMCs, this agreement will mean 
greater access to our low fares and Europe's largest route network."
 Amadeus' SVP Distribution, Holger Taubmann added:
 "Ryanair is the world's most successful low fare airlines so we are delighted the airline has seen the value of 
working with Amadeus to increase its reach, yield and merchandising capabilities. Our technology will enable travel 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR PARTNERS WITH AMADEUS GDS
agencies to book Ryanair flights easily and seamlessly. For our subscriber partners, this agreement underlines our 
commitment to continued innovation in order to offer the widest possible range of airline content."

 RYANAIR PLACES ORDER FOR UP TO 200 NEW
 BOEING 737 MAX 200 AIRCRAFT WORTH UP TO $22BN
 RYANAIR BECOMES LEAD OPERATOR OF "GAMECHANGER" AIRCRAFT, WHICH FIRST DELIVERS IN 2019 & WILL FACILITATE 
GROWTH FROM 112M CUSTOMERS IN 2019 TO 150M BY 2024
 Ryanair, the world's biggest international scheduled airline, today (8(th) Sept) signed an agreement with 
Boeing to purchase up to 200 new Boeing 737 MAX 200 "gamechanger" aircraft (100 firm & 100 options).  When 
finalised and all options exercised, this deal will be worth over $22bn at current list prices.  Ryanair 
becomes the lead customer for this new aircraft which for Ryanair will feature 197 seats (8 more than 
Ryanair's existing 737-800s) and new CFM LEAP-1B engines, which combined with aerodynamic improvements 
will reduce fuel consumption by up to 18% in Ryanair's configuration and reduce operational noise 
emissions by 40%. This will further reduce Ryanair's industry leading low costs, and these savings will be 
passed on via lower fares to Ryanair's customers, which will now grow from 82m in 2014 to over 150m 
customers p.a. by the end of the delivery stream in FY2024.
 This new agreement was signed by Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, and Boeing Commercial Airplanes President 
and CEO Ray Conner, in New York this morning (8(th) Sept).  Following approval by Ryanair's shareholders 
at an EGM in late November, this order will become Boeing's largest ever aircraft order from a European 
airline. It will sustain thousands of skilled manufacturing jobs in Boeing and its supplier companies and 
represents the largest ever capital investment by an Irish company in US manufacturing and jobs.
 These new Boeing 737 MAX 200s contain new features which will significantly lower Ryanair's operating 
costs, including:-
 1.   197 seats (8 more than Ryanair's existing 189 seat fleet)
 2.   New Boeing Sky Interior to enhance customers' onboard experience
 3.   New slimline seats which will provide more leg room (avg. over 30 inches)
 4.   New CFM LEAP-1B engines, which combined with the Advanced Technology winglet and other aerodynamic 
improvements, will reduce fuel consumption by up to 18% in Ryanair's configuration and reduce operational 
noise emissions by 40%
 Ryanair enters into this new aircraft agreement, the day before it takes delivery of the first of 180 new 
Boeing 737-800 aircraft.  The current 180 aircraft order will see Ryanair's fleet grow from 304 to 420 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR ORDER FOR BOEING 737 MAX 200 AIRCRAFT
(allowing for lease returns), and traffic rise from 82m last year to over 112m by 2019.  Becoming the lead 
operator for the Boeing 737 MAX 200 aircraft secures Ryanair's future growth during the period 2019 to 
2024 in which Ryanair's fleet will rise to 520 aircraft (allowing for sales and lease returns) while 
traffic almost doubles from 82m in FY2014 to 150m passengers p.a. by FY2024.
 Announcing the new Boeing 737 MAX 200 order, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair is proud and honoured to become the lead operator of  Boeing's "gamechanger" 737 MAX 200 
aircraft which will expand our fleet to 520 aircraft by 2024 and create another 3,000 new jobs for pilots, 
cabin crew and engineers in Europe, while allowing us to grow traffic from 82m last year to over 150m p.a. 
by FY2024.
 These new "gamechanger" aircraft will allow Ryanair to lower our costs and airfares, while improving our 
customer experience with more leg room and the Boeing Sky Interior, as we roll out new offers, 
particularly for our Business Plus and Family Extra customers.  As many of Europe's flag carriers cut 
capacity on short haul routes, Ryanair looks forward to using these new Boeing 737 MAX 200 aircraft to 
grow at many more of Europe's primary airports.
 As I travel to Seattle tomorrow (9(th) September) to take delivery of the first of our 180 new Boeing 
Next-Generation 737-800 aircraft, I'm proud that Ryanair operates the largest fleet of Boeing airplanes in 
Europe, that we will grow over the next decade to 150m customers annually, while at the same time cutting 
our fuel consumption by 18% and operational noise emissions by 40%. We will also create more than 3,000 
new jobs and exciting promotion opportunities for Ryanair's pilots, cabin crew and engineers.  Ryanair is 
proud to be chosen by Boeing as the lead operator of Boeing's new "gamechanger" 737 MAX 200 and we're 
proud to be investing over $22bn in high quality US manufacturing and jobs."
 Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner said:
 "The 737 MAX 200 is the perfect fit for Ryanair, providing improved efficiencies, 20% lower emissions, 
increased revenues and a high level of passenger comfort. The new variant will play a significant role in 
enabling the airline to continue to expand its operations, while providing passengers across Europe with 
outstanding value. For everyone at Boeing, it is an honour to launch the 737 MAX 200 with Ryanair, one of 
the world's most successful all-Boeing operators."

 Starting in 2009, under a new CEO, Aer Lingus has executed a successful turnaround, growing profitable markets 
such as the transatlantic gateway and delivering EUR104m cost savings.  In 2014, the airline targets an additional 
20 per cent growth in long haul passengers, with new routes to Toronto and San Francisco, the latter taking 
advantage of the many US technology companies that have their European subsidiaries in Dublin. Approximately 
48% of total long haul passengers were connecting passengers in 2013, demonstrating the success of its feeder 
network on both sides of the Atlantic.  Partnership deals with Jet Blue and United Airlines have been put in place to 
feed long haul flights, and these now account for 20% of connecting passengers.
 In 2014 trading has been good, in a challenging context that included strike action by its staff and growing capacity 
from its local competitor Ryanair.  The strike prompted the company to issue a profits warning, yet the strength of 
long haul revenues led to guidance on profits being flat at 2013's level, or EUR61m.  Aer Lingus also announced a 
new two-year profit improvement programme.  This aims to build scale, and reduce costs by EUR30m through 
simplifying business processes and improving reservation and ticketing systems.  As it stands, Aer Lingus has the 
second lowest cost position in Europe, after Ryanair.  Any improvement to the European and US economic 
backdrop should contribute to a recovery in transatlantic traffic.
 Efforts to resolve the dispute over the main Irish Airlines pension scheme continue.  Aer Lingus reluctantly 
accepted the findings of an independent Expert Panel which involve a total EUR190.7m one-off payment by the 
company, and employees are now required to vote on it.
 In our view, Aer Lingus has an asset value, including its Heathrow slots, well in excess of its market capitalisation.  
It is also of clear strategic value to other airlines, as demonstrated by the repeated attempts from Ryanair to buy it 
outright, and the presence of Etihad on the register. A number of catalysts could release this value, and after 
monitoring the situation for a number of years, we initiated this investment in January 2014 in the belief that these 
are nearing fruition.  Key amongst those are the resolution of the pension fund dispute, the disposal of Ryanair's 
stake, the return of surplus cash to shareholders and the likely sale of the Irish state stake.  Meantime, the new self-
help initiative should help the carrier improve its performance.  We see upside from the execution of the 
improvement plan and more in the case of a corporate action.
 Leaf Clean Energy Company ("Leaf")
Crystal Amber Fund Limited Final Results -4-
 Leaf is an investment company set up in 2007 by EEA Fund Management Limited, the manager of Trading 
Emissions PLC, to invest in clean energy projects, predominantly in North America.  The company listed in June 
2007 at 100p a share, raising $386 million net.  Leaf has bought back 71.3 million of its own shares at a cost of 
$79.3 million.  Adjusting for these purchases would reduce the net amount originally invested at IPO to $306.7 
million.  Net assets at 31 December 2013 were $181.9 million, implying a loss of 41 per cent of capital.
 Back in 2007, investors took interest in US renewables in the belief that the US would soon join carbon trading 
schemes.  As EEA did not have direct presence in the US, it joined forces with Shaw Capital to source investment 
opportunities.  By the end of 2009, less than three years after IPO, the portfolio was substantially invested in 11 
companies, and the poor performance of its investments was evident.  Leaf's first investment was $20 million of 
preferred stock in biodiesel firm Greenline Industries, which had already filed for bankruptcy proceedings.
 Ethanol producer Range Fuels Inc. (another $20 million investment) closed down in 2011 without having reached 
production.  A third, solar panel producer MiaSolé (also a $20 million investment), would be written off and sold in 
2012.  As happens when much money chases few opportunities in new asset classes, the wisdom of some 
investments would come under scrutiny.
 In March 2010, as some investments were unravelling, board director Bran Keogh became an executive director. 
Shortly after, EEA Fund Management ceased to be the manager and Leaf set up an in-house team under the 
leadership of its executive director.  Unexpectedly, now that Leaf was managed in-house, the transparency of its 
reports reduced.  As they were written off, both Range Fuels and MiaSolé disappeared from Leaf's reports, with no 
explanation.  Disclosure of ownership structures and valuations became minimal, as did the news flow from Leaf.
 Fees remained out of line with operations.  Despite bringing management in-house, Leaf spent $17.6 million over 
the next three years to oversee a portfolio of less than a dozen companies, including minority investments.  As the 
companies have matured, we estimate that only three required active management.
 Despite the increasing maturity of holdings, no information on revenues or earnings has been provided which 
would enable market participants to have greater visibility of the current financial position of each underlying 
investment.  The valuations in the portfolio are instead undertaken on discounted future cash flow forecasts, despite 
these holdings not being cash generative.  In our view, this is a wholly assumptions-based approach, over reliant 
upon estimates of future cash flows.
 When the Fund initiated its investment in October 2013, Leaf was trading at 45% discount to its then prevailing net 
asset value.  In our view this was the result of a poor investment track record and the scale of its annual running 
costs.
 Leaf however has some attractive investments and amongst those stands out a convertible investment in 
Invenergy Wind, acquired for $40 million. Invenergy Wind is North America's largest wind power generation 
company, and has developed more than 8,000 MW of renewable and natural gas power generation and energy 
storage facilities. Additional value should be obtainable from some of the other operating projects such as 
Johnstown Regional Energy.  Cash on the balance sheet stands at $19.1 million.
 Following engagement with the board, the Fund took decisive action to change the leadership of the company. We 
called an EGM to remove Peter Tom as chairman and Bran Keogh as executive director and proposed that Mark 
Lerdal became executive chairman, with a clear mandate to realise the investments in an orderly fashion.  An 
incentive package was agreed, centred on the cash returned to shareholders.  Leaf's board soon agreed to the 
changes.  The renewed board reviewed the portfolio and initiated steps to realise assets.  It has moved decisively, 
cutting additional funding to MaxWest, a company with an unsuccessful technology for gasification of waste water.
 Excluding MaxWest's $17.2 million carrying value, and allowing for the cash burn, our estimated NAV is $160 
million, implying that Leaf is now trading at approximately 50 per cent of its NAV.  Whilst in our opinion additional 
write downs are likely, we are confident that Leaf can return cash to shareholders significantly in excess of its share 
price.
 Thorntons PLC ("Thorntons")
 Thorntons is a manufacturer and retailer of chocolates.  From its factory in Derby, it supplies its retail estate and 
third party grocers with a range of boxed chocolates and other specialties.  Thorntons is the UK market leader in the 
GBP205 million inlaid boxed chocolate category, with a 35 per cent market share.  Despite years of 
underinvestment in product and stores, Thorntons remains a well-recognised brand, and our survey research 
confirmed that it retains considerable consumer goodwill.
 Thorntons listed in 1988, reporting GBP64 million of revenues and GBP6.4 million of profits.  Around that time, it 
embarked on the construction of its chocolate factory, a grandiose project that would necessitate a considerable 
Crystal Amber Fund Limited Final Results -4-
growth in sales to become economic.  The resulting factory is believed to be the most efficient of its kind in 
managing the complexities of mass producing inlaid boxed chocolates.  To achieve sufficient utilisation of its new 
factory Thorntons, which used to sell its products exclusively through its own estate and Marks & Spencer, initiated 
a strategy to grow to its estate to the maximum. The company grew its own store numbers from 188 to a peak of 
410 in the year 2000.  A quarter of those had been added in just three years, following the arrival of a new CEO.  
Location and size of Thorntons' stores changed from small shops near the high street to include bigger sites in 
prime locations.  Costs grew faster than revenues, and profits were squeezed.  In the meantime, customers moved 
their food purchases in the opposite direction to Thorntons, away from speciality grocers in the high street and 
towards supermarkets, where the Thorntons brand was not available.  A much higher cost base compressed 
margins, and when austerity hit revenues, Thorntons' profits vanished.
 In 2011, the company set out a new strategy to halve its retail estate and grow commercial sales.  This implicitly 
acknowledged the change in consumer behaviour and the need to maintain factory volumes.  Thorntons has been 
fortunate in that, following its binge on new store leases during the 1990s, many of them are coming up for renewal 
now, and will be terminated.  The cost base is therefore expected to reduce as more profitable commercial sales

 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (3 Sept) released August traffic statistics as 
follows:
 --    Traffic grew by 400,000 to 9.4m customers (up 4%)
 --    Load factor increased 4% points from 89% to 93%
 --    Rolling annual traffic rose to a record 83.4m customers (up 4%).

 Customers      9.0m    9.4m    +4%
 Load Factor    89%     93%     +4%
Ryanair's Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs said
 "Ryanair traffic grew by 400,000 to a record 9.4m customers in August, thanks to our lower fares and our improving 
customer experience, including our great new website and mobile app, allocated seating, a free 2(nd) small carry-
on bag and PED use on all flights. The launch of our new family and business products have been extremely 
successful and have contributed significantly to these highest ever load factors in Ryanair's history."
 Editor's note: Ryanair's 9.4m passengers in August is almost as many as Aer Lingus's
 total passengers carried (9.6m) in the full year 2013.

 In the period under review, there were strong contributions from Plus500 (a low-cost online CFD trading platform 
that combines strong growth with an attractive dividend policy), AstraZeneca (improving medium-term prospects), 
Greencore (a convenience food business trading well with good growth prospects) and Shire (bid interest). Relative 
returns against the FTSE All-Share were also helped by not holding Barclays, Rolls-Royce, Diageo and Tesco 
which all delivered disappointing results. Set against this, there were three disappointments: Majestic Wine issued a 
profits warning, William Hill suffered from a surprise increase in gaming duty and N Brown suffered profit taking 
after a strong run and marginally disappointing full year results.
 Portfolio activity was modest during the period under review. We opened new positions in ITV (economic recovery 
should boost advertising spend), Ryanair (reducing costs and improving yields), Shire (attractive business and a 
potential consolidation target) and Playtech (a key B2B partner providing the IT platform for European-based online 
gambling operators). Sterling has been remarkably strong against the dollar this year and this led us to cut holdings 
in Halma and Spirax-Sarco which have sizeable international exposure. We also reduced our positions in BBA 
Aviation and Babcock International.
 Outlook
 After several years of crisis management, central banks in the US and UK are looking to increase interest rates. 
We think this will happen slowly and over a long period because western economies, though recovering, are still 
fragile. That said, in our view the central bankers will push on regardless since they need to be in a position where 
they have effective firepower to provide support come the next recession. There has been uncertainty around the 
speed and timing of these rate rises and this has affected sectors that are sensitive to economic conditions. In our 
view, when rates normalise, they may do so at lower levels. The Governor of the Bank of England suggested in 
June that the "new normal" for long term rates might be closer to 2.5% than the historical 5%. But, for the moment, 
we remain confident that the UK economy will continue to improve, if only because the government's priority is to 
keep the feel-good factor intact for next summer's general election. Our equity positions are in companies we 
believe have the potential to deliver consistent performance and rising dividends.

 Interim Management Report
 Related Party Transactions
 During the first six months of the current financial year no transactions with related parties have taken 
place which have materially affected the financial position or performance of the Company during the 
period.
 Principal Risks and Uncertainties
 The principal risks and uncertainties associated with the Company's business can be divided into the 
following areas:
 --    investment policy and process
 --    market movements
 --    legal and regulatory compliance
 --    operational, and
 --    financial, such as market price risk, interest rate risk, liability risk and credit risk.
 Information on these risks is set out in the 2013 Annual Report & Accounts.
 In the view of the Board these principal risks and uncertainties are applicable to the remaining six 
months of the financial year as they were to the six months under review.
 Going Concern
 The Half-Yearly Financial Report has been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors consider that 
this is the appropriate basis as they have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. In considering this, the 
Directors took into account the Company's investment objective, risk management policies and capital 
management policies, the diversified portfolio of readily realisable securities which can be used to meet 
short-term funding commitments and the ability of the Company to meet all of its liabilities and ongoing 
expenses. Thus the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements.
 Directors' Responsibility Statement
 We, the Directors of Jupiter Dividend & Growth Trust PLC, confirm to the best of our knowledge that:
 (a) The condensed set of financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Accounting 
Standards Board's statement 'Half-Yearly Financial Reports' and give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company for the period ended 30 June 2014;
 (b) The Chairman's Statement, the Investment Advisor's Review and the Interim Management Report include a 
fair review of the information required by Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4.2.7R; and
 (c) The Interim Management Report includes a fair review of the information required by Disclosure and 
Transparency Rule 4.2.8R on related party transactions.
 The Half-Yearly Financial Report has not been audited or reviewed by the Company's auditors.

 LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
 OF RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC
 Dear Shareholder,
 I am pleased to inform you that the Annual Report and Financial Statements for Ryanair Holdings plc for 
the year ended March 31, 2014, are now available on our website www.ryanair.com. You will find the Notice 
of the Annual General Meeting set out on pages 3 to 5 of this document. The Annual General Meeting will be 
held on September 25, 2014 at 9.00 a.m. in the Ryanair Dublin Office, Airside Business Park, Swords, Co. 
Dublin, Ireland.
 Action to be taken
 Proxy Form
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of AGM
 You will find enclosed a Form of Proxy and Attendance Card for the Annual General Meeting.  Whether or 
not you wish to attend the Annual General Meeting you should complete and sign the Form of Proxy and 
return it by no later than 9.00 a.m. on September 23, 2014 to Capita Asset Services, Shareholder solutions 
(Ireland), P.O. Box 7117, Dublin 2, Ireland (Please see notes 4 and 5 attached). Completion and return of 
the Form of Proxy will not preclude you from attending and voting at the Annual General Meeting, should 
you wish to do so. If you wish to attend the Annual General Meeting in person please bring your Attendance 
Card with you. If you appoint a person other than the Chairman or any other officer of Ryanair Holdings 
plc as your proxy, please give your Attendance Card to that person for his/her admission to the Meeting.
 Business to be considered at the Annual General Meeting
 Your attention is drawn to the Notice of Meeting on pages 3 to 5, which sets out matters to be considered 
at the Annual General Meeting. The ordinary business to be transacted at the Annual General Meeting is set 
out in resolutions 1 to 5 in the Notice.
 Under Resolution 2, shareholders are being asked to consider the Remuneration Report contained in 
Ryanair's Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2014. This advisory and non-binding resolution is not 
mandatory and is often referred to as a "say on pay" resolution. While it is not mandatory for companies 
to put such a resolution to shareholders, it is best practice and Ryanair is committed to maintaining the 
highest standards of corporate governance.
 In Resolution 3 shareholders are being asked to approve the payment of a dividend of EUR0.375 per 
Ordinary Share. Having considered the Company's financial position, strategic objectives and prospects, 
the Board has recommended the payment of a dividend of EUR0.375 per Ordinary Share. If approved, the 
dividend will be paid between January and March 2015.
 Resolution 4 deals with the re-election of Directors. The Company's Articles of Association require that 
at least one third of the Directors shall retire by rotation at the AGM in every year. However, in 
compliance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors will retire and 
present themselves for re-election by the shareholders. Biographical details of the Directors are found on 
pages 106 and 107 of the 2014 Annual Report.
 Special Business
 In addition to the ordinary business there are three Resolutions relating to special business.
 Resolution 6 - Directors' Authority to Allot Ordinary Shares
 The Directors are seeking to renew their authority to allot shares in the authorised but unissued share 
capital of the Company for the period up to September 24, 2019.
 Resolution 7 - Disapplication of Statutory Pre-emption Rights
 As was the case at previous years' Annual General Meetings, the Directors are seeking authority to allot 
Ordinary Shares without first offering them to existing shareholders in accordance with statutory pre-
emption rights where the Ordinary Shares are allotted:-
 (a)           On the exercise of any option in accordance with the provisions of the existing Ryanair 
Holdings plc Share Option Plans of 2000, 2003 and 2013;
 (b)           In connection with a rights issue; and
 (c)           Otherwise than in pursuance of (a) and (b) above, up to an aggregate nominal value of the 
greater of EUR439,287, or 5% of the then issued share capital of the Company.
 It is proposed to renew this authority for the period expiring fifteen months from the passing of this 
Resolution or, if earlier, on the day following the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.
 Resolution 8 - Authority to Repurchase Shares
 The Directors are seeking the authority to make market purchases and/or overseas market purchases (as 
defined by Section 212 of the Companies Act, 1990) of the Company's Ordinary Shares and American 
Depositary Shares (ADSs). Any ADSs repurchased will be converted to Ordinary Shares and cancelled as will 
Ordinary Shares repurchased, and the number of Ordinary Shares in issue will reduce accordingly.
 The maximum price at which Ordinary Shares traded on the Irish Stock Exchange or the London Stock 
Exchange could be repurchased would be the higher of (i) 5% above the average market value of the 
Company's Ordinary Shares on the trading venue where the shares are being repurchased for the five 
business days prior to the date of purchase; and (ii) the price stipulated by Article 5(1) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) of December 22, 2003 (No. 2273/2003), being the higher of the last independent trade and 
the highest current independent bid on the trading venue on which the shares are being repurchased. It is 
further proposed that the maximum price at which Ordinary Shares which underlie the Company's ADSs which 
are traded on NASDAQ could be repurchased would be 5% above the average market value of one-fifth of the 
Company's ADSs on NASDAQ for the five business days prior to the date of purchase (as one ADS represents 
five Ordinary Shares).
 The minimum price at which Ordinary Shares could be repurchased would be their nominal value of 0.635 
euro cents. The authority will also enable the Company to repurchase in US dollars or euro.
 Recommendation of Directors
 The Directors believe that the passing of the Resolutions set out in the Notice of Meeting is in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and the Directors unanimously recommend that you 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of AGM
vote in favour of such Resolutions as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings in 
Ordinary Shares which, as at the date of this letter, represent approximately 4.35% of the issued share 
capital of the Company.
 Yours sincerely,
 David Bonderman
 Chairman

 Impact to the Company's Profitability" and "-The Company May Not Be Successful in Increasing Fares and 
Revenues to Cover Rising Business Costs."
 In recent years, in response to an operating environment characterized by high fuel prices, typically lower seasonal 
yields and higher airport charges and/or taxes, Ryanair has adopted a policy of grounding a certain portion of its 
fleet during the winter months (from November to March inclusive). In the winter months of fiscal 2014, Ryanair 
grounded approximately 70 aircraft and the Company announced in May 2014 that it intends to ground 
approximately 50 aircraft during the winter months of fiscal 2015. While seasonal grounding does reduce the 
Company's operating costs, it also decreases Ryanair's potential to record both flight and non-flight revenues. 
Decreasing the number and frequency of flights may also negatively affect the Company's labor relations, including 
its ability to attract flight personnel interested in full-time employment. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-
Ryanair has Decided to Seasonally Ground Aircraft."
 ROUTE SYSTEM, SCHEDULING AND FARES
 Route System and Scheduling
 As of July 25, 2014, the Company offered over 1,600 scheduled short-haul flights per day serving approximately 
186 airports largely throughout Europe, and flying approximately 1,600 routes. The following table lists Ryanair's

 See Note 17, "Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis," to the consolidated financial 
statements included in Item 18 for more information regarding the geographical sources of the Company's 
revenue.
 Management's objective is to schedule a sufficient number of flights per day on each of Ryanair's routes 
to satisfy demand for Ryanair's low-fares service. Ryanair schedules departures on its most popular routes 
at frequent intervals; normally between approximately 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. Management regularly 
reviews the need for adjustments in the number of flights on all of its routes.
 During the 2014 fiscal year, Ryanair opened 121 new routes across its network. See "Risk Factors-Risks 
Related to the Company-Ryanair's New Routes and Expanded Operations May Have an Adverse Financial Impact 
on Its Results."
 Low and Widely Available Fares
 Ryanair offers low fares, with prices generally varying on the basis of advance booking, seat 
availability and demand. Ryanair sells seats on a one-way basis, thus removing minimum stay requirements 
from all travel on Ryanair scheduled services. All tickets can be changed, subject to certain conditions, 
including fee payment and applicable upgrade charges. However, tickets are generally non-cancelable and 
non-refundable and must be paid for at the time of reservation.
 Ryanair's discounted fares are "capacity controlled" in that Ryanair allocates a specific number of seats 
on each flight to each fare category to accommodate projected demand for seats at each fare level leading 
up to flight time. Ryanair generally makes its lowest fares widely available by allocating a majority of 
its seat inventory to its lowest fare categories. Management believes that its unrestricted fares as well 
as its advance-purchase fares are attractive to both business and leisure travelers.
 When launching a new route, Ryanair's policy is to price its lowest fare so that it will be significantly 
lower than other carriers' lowest fares, but still provide a satisfactory operating margin.
 Ryanair also periodically runs special promotional fare campaigns, in particular in connection with the 
opening of new routes, and endeavors to always offer the lowest fare on any route it serves. Promotional 
fares may have the effect of increasing load factors and reducing Ryanair's yield and passenger revenues 
on the relevant routes during the periods they are in effect. Ryanair expects to continue to offer 
significant fare promotions to stimulate demand in periods of lower activity or during off-peak times for 
the foreseeable future.
 MARKETING AND ADVERTISING
 Ryanair's primary marketing strategy is to emphasize its widely available low fares, route choice and 
great service. In doing so, Ryanair primarily advertises its services in national and regional media 
across Europe. In addition, we use topical advertising, social media, press conferences and publicity 
stunts. Other marketing activities include the distribution of advertising and promotional material and 
cooperative advertising campaigns with other travel-related entities, including local tourist boards. 
Ryanair also regularly contacts people registered in its database to inform them about promotions and 
special offers.
 RESERVATIONS ON RYANAIR.COM
 Passenger airlines generally rely on travel agents (whether traditional or online) for a significant 
portion of their ticket sales and pay travel agents commissions for their services, as well as reimbursing 
them for the fees charged by reservation systems providers. In contrast, Ryanair requires passengers to 
make reservations and purchase tickets directly through the Company. Currently, over 99% of such 
reservations and purchases are made through the website Ryanair.com. Ryanair is therefore not reliant on 
travel agents. See "-Strategy-Taking Advantage of the Internet" above for additional information.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -27-
 In May 2012, Ryanair further upgraded its reservation system in order to facilitate the continued 
expansion of the airline.  The upgraded system gives the Company the ability to offer more enhancements to 
passengers, as the new platform is far more flexible in terms of future development. Under the agreement 
with the system provider, Navitaire, the system serves as Ryanair's core seating inventory and booking 
system. In return for access to these system functions, Ryanair pays transaction fees that are generally 
based on the number of passenger seat journeys booked through the system. Navitaire also retains a back-up 
booking engine to support operations in the event of a breakdown in the main system. Over the last several 
years, Ryanair has introduced a number of Internet-based customer service enhancements such as Internet 
check-in, priority boarding service and limited reserved seating since January 2012. Since October 2009, 
Ryanair has required Internet check-in for all passengers. These enhancements and changes have been made 
to reduce waiting time at airports and speed a passenger's journey from arrival at the airport to 
boarding, as well as significantly reduce airport handling costs. Ryanair has also introduced a checked-
bag fee, which is payable on the Internet and is aimed at reducing the number of bags carried by 
passengers in order to further reduce handling costs. On April 1, 2014, the Company entered an agreement 
with Travelport who operate the Galileo and Worldspan GDS. The Company's fares (except for the three 
lowest fare categories) will be distributed on the Galileo and Worldspan systems. Ryanair has negotiated 
an attractive per segment price and expects to sell tickets via travel agents at no commission to a mix of 
largely business/corporate travelers. See Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the 
Company-Ryanair Faces Risks Related to Unauthorized Use of Information from the Company's Website."
 AIRCRAFT
 Aircraft
 As of June 30, 2014, Ryanair had a principal fleet of 297 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and 5 additional leased 
aircraft acquired on short term leases for the summer of 2014 to provide extra capacity. The principal 
fleet was composed of 297 Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, each having 189 seats. Ryanair's 
fleet totaled 297 Boeing 737-800s at March 31, 2014. The Company expects to have an operating fleet 
comprising approximately 426 Boeing 737-800s at March 31, 2019 depending on the level of lease 
returns/disposals.
 Between March 1999 and March 2014, Ryanair took delivery of 348 new Boeing 737-800 "next generation" 
aircraft under its contracts with Boeing and disposed of 51 such aircraft, including 25 lease handbacks.

______________
 RISK FACTORS
 Risks Related to the Company
 Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood of Adverse 
Impact to the Company's Profitability. Jet fuel costs are subject to wide fluctuations as a result of many economic 
and political factors and events occurring throughout the world that Ryanair can neither control nor accurately 
predict, including increases in demand, sudden disruptions in supply and other concerns about global supply, as 
well as market speculation. Oil prices increased substantially in fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014 and remain at 
elevated levels. As international prices for jet fuel are denominated in U.S. dollars, Ryanair's fuel costs are also 
subject to certain exchange rate risks. Substantial price increases, adverse exchange rates, or the unavailability of 
adequate fuel supplies, including, without limitation, any such events resulting from international terrorism, 
prolonged hostilities in Ukraine or the Middle East or other oil-producing regions or the suspension of production by 
any significant producer, may adversely affect Ryanair's profitability. In the event of a fuel shortage resulting from a 
disruption of oil imports or otherwise, additional increases in fuel prices or a curtailment of scheduled services could 
result.
 Ryanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel 
prices, generally through forward contracts covering periods of up to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel requirements. 
As of July 25, 2014, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts covering approximately 90% 
of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015 at prices equivalent to approximately $950 
per metric ton. In addition, as of July 25, 2014, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts 
covering approximately 55% of its estimated requirements for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 
at prices equivalent to approximately $950 per metric ton. Ryanair is exposed to risks arising from fluctuations in the 
price of fuel, and movements in the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate because of the limited nature of its hedging 
program, especially in light of the recent volatility in the relevant currency and commodity markets. Any further 
increase in fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on Ryanair's financial performance. In addition, any 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro could have an adverse effect on the cost of buying fuel in euro. As 
of July 25, 2014, Ryanair had hedged approximately 90% of its forecasted fuel-related dollar purchases against the 
euro at a rate of approximately $1.34 per euro for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015 and approximately 50% of 
its forecasted fuel related dollar purchases against the euro at a rate of approximately $1.37 per euro for the first 6 
months of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016.
 No assurances whatsoever can be given about trends in fuel prices, and average fuel prices for future years may 
be significantly higher than current prices. Management estimates that every $10 movement in the price of a metric 
ton of jet fuel will impact Ryanair's costs by approximately EUR2 million, taking into account Ryanair's hedging 
programme for the 2015 fiscal year. There can be no assurance, however, in this regard, and the impact of fuel 
prices on Ryanair's operating results may be more, or less,  pronounced. There also cannot be any assurance that 
Ryanair's current or any future arrangements will be adequate to protect Ryanair from increases in the price of fuel 
or that Ryanair will not incur losses due to high fuel prices, either alone or in combination with other factors. 
Because of Ryanair's low fares and its no-fuel-surcharges policy, as well as Ryanair's expansion plans, which could 
have a negative impact on yields, its ability to pass on increased fuel costs to passengers through increased fares 
or otherwise is somewhat limited. Moreover, the anticipated expansion of Ryanair's fleet from September 2014 
onwards will likely result in an increase, in absolute terms, in Ryanair's aggregate fuel costs.
 Ryanair Has Decided to Seasonally Ground Aircraft. In recent years, in response to an operating environment 
characterized by high fuel prices, typically lower winter traffic and yields and higher airport charges and/or taxes, 
Ryanair has adopted a policy of grounding a certain portion of its fleet during the winter months (from November to 
March). In the winter of fiscal year 2014, Ryanair grounded approximately 70 aircraft and the Company intends to 
again ground approximately 50 aircraft in the coming winter. Ryanair's adoption of the policy of seasonally 
grounding aircraft presents some risks. While Ryanair seeks to implement its seasonal grounding policy in a way 
that will allow it to reduce losses by operating flights during periods of high oil prices to high cost airports at low 
winter yields, there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful.
 Additionally, Ryanair's growth has been largely dependent on increasing summer capacity, and decreasing winter 
capacity, which may affect the overall future growth of Ryanair. Further, while seasonal grounding does reduce 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -17-
Ryanair's variable operating costs, it does not avoid fixed costs such as aircraft ownership costs, and it also 
decreases Ryanair's potential to earn ancillary revenues. Decreasing the number and frequency of flights may also 
negatively affect Ryanair's labor relations, including its ability to attract flight personnel only interested in year round 
employment. Such risks could lead to negative effects on Ryanair's financial condition and/or results of operations.
 Ryanair May Not Achieve All of the Expected Benefits of its Recent Strategic Initiatives. Ryanair is in the process of 
implementing a series of strategic initiatives that are expected to have a significant impact on its business.  Among 
other things, these initiatives include scheduling more flights to primary airports, selling flights via corporate travel 
agents on global distribution systems ("GDS"), increasing marketing spending significantly, and adjusting the 
airline's yield management strategy with the goal of increasing load factors. Ryanair has also announced a series of 
customer-experience related initiatives, including a new, easier-to-navigate website with a fare finder facility, 
reduced penalty fees, more customer-friendly baggage allowances, 24 hour grace periods to correct minor booking 
errors and the introduction of allocated seating. For additional information on these initiatives, see "Strategy". 
Although customer reaction to the measures has, so far, been positive and management expects these initiatives to 
be accretive to the Company's results over time, no assurance can be given that the financial impact of the 
initiatives will be positive, particularly in the short to medium term. In particular, certain of the strategic initiatives 
may have the effect of increasing certain of the Company's costs (including airport fees and marketing expenses), 
while reducing ancillary revenues previously earned from website sales and from various penalty fees and charges. 
Although the Company expects that revenues from allocated seating will offset the reduction in ancillary revenues, 
there can be no assurance that this will occur. Factors beyond Ryanair's control, including but not limited to 
customer acceptance, competitive reactions, market and economic conditions and other challenges described in 
this report could limit Ryanair's ability to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of these initiatives. A relatively 
minor shortfall from expected revenue levels (or increase in expected costs) could have a material adverse effect 
on the Company's growth or financial performance.
 Currency Fluctuations Affect the Company's Results. Although the Company is headquartered in Ireland, a 
significant portion of its operations are conducted in the U.K. Consequently, the Company has significant operating 
revenues and operating expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, denominated in U.K. pounds sterling. In 
addition, fuel, aircraft, insurance, and some maintenance obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars. The 
Company's operations and financial performance can therefore be significantly affected by fluctuations in the values 
of the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar. Ryanair is particularly vulnerable to direct exchange rate risks 
between the euro and the U.S. dollar because a significant portion of its operating costs are incurred in U.S. dollars 
and none of its revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars.

 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 Legal Proceedings
 The Company is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business. Although no 
assurance can be given as to the outcome of any current or pending litigation, management does not believe 
that any of such litigation will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
results of operations or financial condition of the Company, except as described below.
 EU State Aid-Related Proceedings. On December 11, 2002, the European Commission announced the launch of 
an investigation into the 2001 agreement among Ryanair, the Brussels (Charleroi) airport and the 
government of the Walloon Region of Belgium, the owner of the airport, which enabled the Company to launch 
new routes and base up to four aircraft at Brussels (Charleroi). The European Commission's investigation 
was based on an anonymous complaint alleging that Ryanair's arrangements with Brussels (Charleroi) 
constituted illegal state aid.
 The European Commission issued its decision on February 12, 2004. As regards to the majority of the 
arrangements between Ryanair, the airport and the region, the European Commission found that although they 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -48-
constituted state aid, they were nevertheless compatible with the EC Treaty provisions and therefore did 
not require repayment. However, the European Commission also found that certain other arrangements did 
constitute illegal state aid and therefore ordered Ryanair to repay the amount of the benefit received in 
connection with those arrangements. On April 20, 2004, the Walloon Region wrote to Ryanair requesting 
repayment of such state aid, although it acknowledged that Ryanair could offset against the amount of such 
state aid certain costs incurred in relation to the establishment of the base, in accordance with the 
European Commission's decision. Ryanair made the requested repayment.
 On May 25, 2004, Ryanair appealed the decision of the European Commission to the Court of First Instance 
("CFI"), requesting the court to annul the decision because:
 --      the European Commission infringed Article 253 of the EC Treaty by failing to provide adequate 
reasons for its decision; and
 --      the European Commission misapplied Article 87 of the EC Treaty by failing to properly apply the 
Market Economy Investor Principle (MEIP), which generally holds that an investment made by a public entity 
that would have been made on the same basis by a private entity does not constitute state aid.
 In March 2008, Ryanair had its hearing before the CFI, and in December 2008, the CFI annulled the 
European Commission's decision. Ryanair was repaid the EUR4.0 million that the Commission had claimed was 
illegal state aid. The Belgian government has also withdrawn a separate EUR2.3 million action against 
Ryanair arising from the European Commission's decision.
 In January 2010, the European Commission concluded that the financial arrangements between Bratislava 
airport in Slovakia and Ryanair do not constitute state aid within the meaning of EU rules, because these 
arrangements were in line with market terms. In July 2012, the European Commission similarly concluded 
that the financial arrangements between Tampere airport in Finland and Ryanair do not constitute state 
aid. In February 2014, the European Commission decided that the financial arrangements between Aarhus, 
Berlin (Schönefeld) and Marseille airports, and Ryanair, did not constitute state aid. On July 23, 2014 
the European Commission announced a 'no state aid' decision in respect of Dusseldorf (Weeze) airport, as 
well as findings of state aid to Ryanair in its arrangements with Pau, Nimes and Angouleme airports, 
ordering Ryanair to repay a total of approximately EUR9.7m of alleged aid.  Ryanair will appeal these 
'aid' decisions to the EU General Court where proceedings are expected to take between 2 and 4 years.
 Ryanair is facing similar legal challenges with respect to agreements with certain other airports, 
notably Lübeck, Alghero, Frankfurt (Hahn), Zweibrücken, Altenburg, Klagenfurt, (Stockholm) Vasteras, Paris 
(Beauvais), 
La 
Rochelle, 
Carcassonne, 
Cagliari, 
Brussels 
(Charleroi), 
Girona 
and 
Reus. 
These 
investigations are ongoing and Ryanair currently expects that they will conclude in mid to late 2014, with 
any European Commission decisions appealable to the EU General Court.
 State aid complaints by Lufthansa about Ryanair's cost base at Frankfurt (Hahn) have been rejected by 
German courts, as have similar complaints by Air Berlin in relation to Ryanair's arrangement with Lubeck 
airport, but following a German Supreme Court ruling on a procedural issue in early 2011, these cases will 
be re-heard by lower courts. In addition, Ryanair has been involved in legal challenges including 
allegations of state aid at Alghero, Marseille and Berlin Schönefeld airports. The Alghero case (initiated 
by Air One) was dismissed in its entirety in April 2011. The Marseille case was withdrawn by the 
plaintiffs (subsidiaries of Air France) in May 2011. The Berlin Schönefeld, initiated by Germania, case 
was discontinued following the European Commission's finding in February 2014 that Ryanair's arrangement 
with the airport contained no state aid.

 Although the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions between the euro and the U.S. dollar, 
between the euro and the U.K. pound sterling, and between the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar, hedging 
activities cannot be expected to eliminate currency risks. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
About Market Risk."
 The Company May Not Be Successful in Increasing Fares to Cover Rising Business Costs. Ryanair operates a 
low-fares airline. The success of its business model depends on its ability to control costs so as to deliver low fares 
while at the same time earning a profit. Ryanair has limited control over its fuel costs and already has comparatively 
low operating costs. In periods of high fuel costs, if Ryanair is unable to further reduce its other operating costs or 
generate additional revenues, operating profits are likely to fall. Furthermore, as part of its change in marketing and 
airport strategy, the Company will expect increased marketing and advertising costs along with higher airport 
charges due to the increasing number of primary airports it operates to. Ryanair cannot offer any assurances 
regarding its future profitability. Changes in fuel costs and fuel availability could have a material adverse impact on 
Ryanair's results and could also increase the likelihood that Ryanair may incur losses. See "-The Company Faces 
Significant Price and Other Pressures in a Highly Competitive Environment" below and "-Changes in Fuel Costs 
and Fuel Availability Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood of Adverse Impact to the Company's 
Profitability" above.
 The Company is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports. Formal investigations are 
ongoing by the European Commission into Ryanair's agreements with the Lübeck, Alghero, Frankfurt (Hahn), 
Zweibrücken, Altenburg, Klagenfurt, Stockholm (Vasteras), Paris (Beauvais), La Rochelle, Carcassonne, Brussels 
(Charleroi), Cagliari, Girona and Reus airports. The investigations seek to determine whether the arrangements 
constitute illegal state aid under EU law. The investigations are expected to be completed in mid to late 2014, with 
the European Commission's decisions being appealable to the EU General Court. Investigations between 2010 and 
2014 into Ryanair's agreements with the Bratislava, Tampere, Marseille, Berlin (Schönefeld) and Aarhus airports 
concluded with findings that these agreements contained no state aid. On July 23, 2014 the European Commission 
announced a 'no state aid' decision in respect of Dusseldorf (Weeze) airport, as well as findings of state aid to 
Ryanair in its arrangements with Pau, Nimes and Angouleme airports, ordering Ryanair to repay a total of 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -18-
approximately EUR9.7m of alleged aid.  Ryanair will appeal these 'aid' decisions to the EU General Court where 
proceedings are expected to take between 2 and 4 years. In addition to the European Commission investigations, 
Ryanair is facing allegations that it has benefited from unlawful state aid in a number of court cases, including in 
relation to its arrangements with Frankfurt (Hahn) and Lübeck airports. Adverse rulings in the above state aid 
matters could be used as precedents by competitors to challenge Ryanair's agreements with other publicly owned 
airports and could cause Ryanair to strongly reconsider its growth strategy in relation to public or state-owned 
airports across Europe. This could in turn lead to a scaling-back of Ryanair's overall growth strategy due to the 
smaller number of privately owned airports available for development.
 On July 25, 2012, the European Commission decided that Ryanair, along with Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") 
and Aer Arann, had been in receipt of unlawful state aid from the Irish government as a result of being an identified 
beneficiary of the two-tier air travel tax in place for flights departing from Irish airports between March 2009 and 
March 2011.  Ryanair was the original complainant to the European Commission, alleging that the air travel tax 
favored Aer Arann and Aer Lingus.  Ryanair appealed the decision of the European Commission to the EU General 
Court on November 14, 2012.  The hearing in the EU General Court took place in June 2014, and judgment is 
expected within six months of the hearing.  The EU General Court may affirm or annul the European Commission 
decision.  The Irish State is obliged to recover the unlawful state aid from Ryanair before the Irish courts 
notwithstanding Ryanair's appeal of the EU Commission decision, and initiated its claim in April 2013. The Irish 
State is seeking approximately EUR12 million plus interest from Ryanair in these proceedings.  Ryanair has also 
issued proceedings before the Irish courts for recovery of the entire amount of the air travel tax paid during the 
period March 2009 - March 2011 on the basis of the two-tier nature of the tax being unlawful under EU law.
 No assurance can be given as to the outcome of these legal proceedings, nor as to whether any unfavorable 
outcomes may, individually or in the aggregate, have an adverse effect on the results of operations or financial 
condition of Ryanair.
 For additional information, please see "Item 8. Financial Information 3/4 Other Financial Information 3/4 Legal 
Proceedings."
 The Company Faces Significant Price and Other Pressures in a Highly Competitive Environment. Ryanair operates 
in a highly competitive marketplace, with a number of low-fare, traditional and charter airlines competing throughout 
its route network. Airlines compete primarily in respect of fare levels, frequency and dependability of service, name 
recognition, passenger amenities (such as access to frequent flyer programmes), and the availability and 
convenience of other passenger services. Unlike Ryanair, certain competitors are state-owned or state-controlled 
flag carriers and in some cases may have greater name recognition and resources and may have received, or may 
receive in the future, significant amounts of subsidies and other state aid from their respective governments. In 
addition, the EU-U.S. Open Skies Agreement, which came into effect in March 2008, allows U.S. carriers to offer 
services in the intra-EU market, which could eventually result in increased competition in the EU market. See "Item 
4. Information on the Company-Government Regulation-Liberalization of the EU Air Transportation Market."
 The airline industry is highly susceptible to price discounting, in part because airlines incur very low marginal costs 
for providing service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. Both low-fare and traditional airlines 
sometimes offer low fares in direct competition with Ryanair across a significant proportion of its route network as a 
result of the liberalization of the EU air transport market and greater public acceptance of the low-fares model. 
Ryanair's average booked passenger fare decreased in the 2014 fiscal year, and there can be no assurance that it 
will not decrease further in future periods.
 Although Ryanair intends to compete vigorously and to assert its rights against any predatory pricing or other 
similar conduct, price competition among airlines could reduce the level of fares and/or passenger traffic on 
Ryanair's routes to the point where profitability may not be achievable.
 In addition to traditional competition among airline companies and charter operators who have entered the low-
fares market, the industry also faces competition from ground transportation (including high-speed rail systems) and 
sea transportation alternatives, as businesses and recreational travellers seek substitutes for air travel.
 The Company Will Incur Significant Costs Acquiring New Aircraft and Any Instability in the Credit and Capital 
Markets Could Negatively Impact Ryanair's Ability to Obtain Financing on Acceptable Terms. Ryanair's continued 
growth is dependent upon its ability to acquire additional aircraft to meet additional capacity needs and to replace 
older aircraft. Ryanair had 297 aircraft in its fleet by March 31, 2014 and has ordered an additional 180 new Boeing 
737-800 next generation aircraft (the "New Aircraft") for delivery during fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2019 pursuant to a 
contract with the Boeing Company (the "2013 Boeing Contract").  Ryanair expects to have approximately 426 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -18-
aircraft in its fleet by March 31, 2019, depending on the level of lease returns/disposals. For additional information 
on the Company's aircraft fleet and expansion plans, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-Aircraft" and "Item 
5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 3/4 Liquidity and Capital Resources." There can be no assurance 
that this planned expansion will not outpace the growth of passenger traffic on Ryanair's routes or that traffic growth 
will not prove to be greater than the expanded fleet can accommodate. In either case, such developments could 
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
 As a result of the 2013 Boeing Contract, the Company is expected to raise substantial debt financing to cover all of 
the expected aircraft deliveries over the period from September 2014 to December 2018, including Ryanair's 
issuance of EUR850.0 million in 1.875% unsecured eurobonds with a 7 year tenor in June 2014 that are 
guaranteed by Ryanair Holdings. This aircraft order is expected to increase the Company's outstanding debt from 
fiscal 2015 onwards.  Furthermore, Ryanair's ability to raise unsecured or secured debt to pay for aircraft as they 
are delivered is subject to various conditions imposed by the counterparties and debt markets to such loan facilities 
and related loan guarantees, and any future financing is expected to be subject to similar conditions.  Any failure by 
Ryanair to comply with such conditions would have a material adverse effect on its operations and financial 
condition.

 Ryanair is exposed to potential catastrophic losses that may be incurred in the event of an aircraft accident or 
terrorist incident. Any such accident or incident could involve costs related to the repair or replacement of a 
damaged aircraft and its consequent temporary or permanent loss from service. In addition, an accident or incident 
could result in significant legal claims against the Company from injured passengers and others who experienced 
injury or property damage as a result of the accident or incident, including ground victims. Ryanair maintains 
aviation third-party liability insurance, passenger liability insurance, employer liability insurance, directors and 
officers liability insurance, aircraft insurance for aircraft loss or damage, and other business insurance in amounts 
per occurrence consistent with industry standards. Ryanair believes its insurance coverage is adequate, although 
not comprehensive. 
There can be no assurance that the amount of such coverage will not need to be increased, that insurance 
premiums will not increase significantly or that Ryanair will not be forced to bear substantial losses from accidents. 
Ryanair's insurance does not cover claims for losses incurred when, due to unforeseen events, airspace is closed 
and aircraft are grounded, such as the airspace closures described in "Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Airline 
Industry - Volcanic Ash Emissions Could Affect the Company and Have a Material Adverse Impact on the 
Company's Results of Operation", which resulted from volcanic ash in the northern European airspace during April 
and May 2010.
 The cost of insurance coverage for certain third-party liabilities arising from "acts of war" or terrorism increased 
dramatically as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In the immediate aftermath, aircraft liability war 
indemnities for amounts above $50 million were, in the absence of any alternative coverage, provided by the Irish 
Government at pre-September 11, 2001 levels of coverage on the basis of a per-passenger surcharge. In March 
2002, once such coverage was again commercially available, Ryanair arranged coverage to replace that provided 
by the government indemnity. The replacement insurance coverage operated on the basis of a per-passenger 
surcharge with an additional surcharge based on hull values. Ryanair's insurers have indicated that the scope of the 
Company's current war-related insurance coverage may exclude certain types of catastrophic incidents, which may 
result in the Company seeking alternative coverage. Ryanair to date has passed increased insurance costs on to 
passengers by means of a special "insurance levy" incorporated in each ticket.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -31-
 During the 2006 fiscal year, Ryanair established Aviation Insurance (IOM) Limited ("AIL"), a wholly owned 
insurance company subsidiary, to provide the Company with self-insurance as part of its ongoing risk-management 
strategy. AIL underwrites a portion of the Company's aviation insurance program, which covers not only the 
Company's aircraft but also its liability to passengers and to third parties. AIL reinsures virtually all of the aviation 
insurance risk it underwrites with recognized third parties in the aviation reinsurance market, with the amount of 
AIL's maximum aggregate exposure not currently subject to such reinsurance agreements being equal to 
approximately $16.5 million. In addition to aviation insurance, AIL has underwritten most of the single trip travel 
insurance policies sold on Ryanair.com since February 1, 2011.
 Council Regulation (EC) No. 2027/97, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No. 889/2002, governs air carrier 
liability. This legislation provides for unlimited liability of an air carrier in the event of death or bodily injuries suffered 
by passengers, implementing the Warsaw Convention of 1929 for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to 
Transportation by Air, as amended by the Montreal Convention of 1999. Ryanair has extended its liability insurance 
to meet the appropriate requirements of the legislation. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to 
the Airline Industry-The Company Faces the Risk of Loss and Liability" for information on the Company's risks of 
loss and liability.

Ryanair has agreements with the DAA, the Irish government authority charged with operating Dublin Airport, 
to lease bag-drop counters and other space at the passenger and cargo terminal facilities at Dublin 
Airport. The airport office facilities used by Ryanair at London (Stansted) are leased from the airport 
authority; similar facilities at each of the other airports Ryanair serves are provided by Servisair plc 
or other service providers.
 TRADEMARKS
 Ryanair's logo and the slogans "Ryanair.com The Low Fares Website" and "Ryanair The Low Fares Airline" 
have been registered as Community Trade Marks ("CTMs"). Ryanair has also registered the CTM for the word 
"Ryanairhotels.com." A CTM allows a trademark owner to obtain a single registration of its trademark, 
which registration affords uniform protection for that trademark in all EU member states. The registration 
gives Ryanair an exclusive monopoly over the use of its trade name with regard to similar services and the 
right to sue for trademark infringement should another party use an identical or confusingly similar 
trademark in relation to identical, or similar services.
 Ryanair has not registered either its name or its logo as a trademark in Ireland, as CTM-registration 
provides all of the protection available from an Irish registration, and management believes there are 
therefore no advantages in making a separate Irish application.
 Ryanair's trademarks include:
 -       Community (Word) Trade Mark registration number 004168721 comprised of the word "Ryanair" in 
classes 16, 28, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 42 (Nice Classification);
 -       Community (Figurative) Trade Mark registration number 001493329 comprising the following graphic

 Any Significant Outbreak of any Airborne Disease Could Significantly Damage Ryanair's Business. Worldwide, 
there has, from time to time, been substantial publicity in recent years regarding certain potent influenza viruses 
and other disease epidemics. Publicity of this type may have a negative impact on demand for air travel in Europe. 
Past outbreaks of MERS, SARS, foot-and-mouth disease, avian flu and swine flu have adversely impacted the 
travel industries, including aviation, in certain regions of the world, including Europe. The Company believes that if 
any influenza or other pandemic becomes severe in Europe, its effect on demand for air travel in the markets in 
which Ryanair operates could be material, and it could therefore have a significantly adverse impact on the 
Company. A severe outbreak of swine flu, MERS, SARS, foot-and-mouth disease, avian flu or another pandemic or 
livestock-related disease also may result in European or national authorities imposing restrictions on travel, further 
damaging Ryanair's business. A serious pandemic could therefore severely disrupt Ryanair's business, resulting in 
the cancellation or loss of bookings, and adversely affecting Ryanair's financial condition and results of operations.
 The Company is Dependent on the Continued Acceptance of Low-fares Airlines. Ryanair has an excellent 30 year 
safety record. In past years, however, accidents or other safety-related incidents involving certain low-fares airlines 
have had a negative impact on the public's acceptance of such airlines. Any adverse event potentially relating to the 
safety or reliability of low-fares airlines (including accidents or negative reports from regulatory authorities) could 
adversely impact the public's perception of, and confidence in, low-fares airlines like Ryanair, and could have a 
material adverse effect on Ryanair's financial condition and results of operations.
 Terrorism in the United Kingdom or Elsewhere in Europe Could Have a Material Detrimental Effect on the 
Company. On August 10, 2006, U.K. security authorities arrested and subsequently charged eight individuals in 
connection with an alleged plot to attack aircraft operating on transatlantic routes. As a result of these arrests, U.K. 
authorities introduced increased security measures, which resulted in all passengers being body-searched, and a 
ban on the transportation in carry-on baggage of certain liquids and gels. The introduction of these measures led to 
passengers suffering severe delays while passing through these airport security checks. As a result, Ryanair 
cancelled 279 flights in the days following the incident and refunded a total of EUR2.7 million in fares to 
approximately 40,000 passengers. In the days following the arrests, Ryanair also suffered reductions in bookings 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -23-
estimated to have resulted in the loss of approximately EUR1.9 million of additional revenue. As in the past, the 
Company reacted to these adverse events by initiating system-wide fare sales to stimulate demand for air travel.
 In addition, reservations on Ryanair's flights to London dropped materially for a number of days in the immediate 
aftermath of the terrorist attacks in London on July 7, 2005. Although the terrorist attack in Glasgow on June 30, 
2007 and the failed terrorist attacks in London on July 21, 2005 and June 29, 2007 had no material impact on 
bookings, there can be no assurance that future such attacks will not affect passenger traffic. In the 2014 fiscal 
year, 16.6 million passengers were booked on Ryanair's flights into and out of London, representing approximately 
20.4% of the total passengers booked on all of the Company's flights in the fiscal year. Future acts of terrorism or 
significant terrorist threats, particularly in London or other markets that are significant to Ryanair, could have a 
material adverse effect on the Company's profitability or financial condition should the public's willingness to travel 
to and from those markets decline as a result. See also "-The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a 
Severe Negative Impact on the International Airline Industry" below.
 The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe Negative Impact on the International Airline 
Industry. The terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, in which four commercial aircraft were 
hijacked, had a severe negative impact on the international airline industry, particularly on U.S. carriers and carriers 
operating international services to and from the United States. Although carriers such as Ryanair that operate 
primarily or exclusively in Europe were generally spared from such material adverse impacts on their businesses, 
the cost to all commercial airlines of insurance coverage for certain third-party liabilities arising from "acts of war" or 
terrorism increased dramatically after the September 11 attacks. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Insurance." In addition, Ryanair's insurers have indicated that the scope of the Company's current "act of war"-
related insurance may exclude certain types of catastrophic incidents, such as certain forms of biological, chemical 
or "dirty bomb" attacks. This could result in the Company's seeking alternative coverage, including government 
insurance or self-insurance, which could lead to further increases in costs. Although Ryanair to date has included 
increased insurance costs in the ticket price charged to passengers, there can be no assurance that it will continue 
to be successful in doing so.
 Because a substantial portion of airline travel (both business and personal) is discretionary and because Ryanair is 
substantially dependent on discretionary air travel, any prolonged general reduction in airline passenger traffic may 
adversely affect the Company. Similarly, any significant increase in expenses related to security, insurance or 
related costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Any further terrorist attacks in the U.S. or in 
Europe, particularly in London or other markets that are significant to Ryanair, any significant military actions by the 
United States or EU nations or any related economic downturn may have a material adverse effect on demand for 
air travel and thus on Ryanair's business, operating results, and financial condition. See also "-Terrorism in the 
United Kingdom or Elsewhere in Europe Could have a Material Detrimental Effect on the Company."
 The Company Faces the Risk of Loss and Liability.Ryanair has an excellent 30 year safety record, however, it is 
exposed to potential catastrophic losses that may be incurred in the event of an aircraft accident or terrorist 
incident. Any such accident or incident could involve costs related to the repair or replacement of a damaged 
aircraft and its consequent temporary or permanent loss from service. In addition, an accident or incident could 
result in significant legal claims against the Company from injured passengers and others who experienced injury or 
property damage as a result of the accident or incident, including ground victims. Ryanair currently maintains 
passenger liability insurance, employer liability insurance, aircraft insurance for aircraft loss or damage, and other 
business insurance in amounts per occurrence that are consistent with industry standards.
 Ryanair currently believes its insurance coverage is adequate (although not comprehensive). However, there can 
be no assurance that the amount of insurance coverage will not need to be increased, that insurance premiums will 
not increase significantly, or that Ryanair will not be forced to bear substantial losses from any accidents not 
covered by its insurance. Airline insurance costs increased dramatically following the September 2001 terrorist 
attacks on the United States. See "-The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe Negative Impact 
on the International Airline Industry" above. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of related 
insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial 
condition. Moreover, any aircraft accident, even if fully insured, could lead to the public perception that Ryanair's 
aircraft were less safe or reliable than those operated by other airlines, which could have a material adverse effect 
on Ryanair's business.
 EU Regulation No. 2027/97, as amended by Regulation No. 889/2002, governs air carrier liability. See "Item 4. 
Information on the Company-Insurance" for details of this regulation. This regulation increased the potential liability 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -23-
exposure of air carriers such as Ryanair. Although Ryanair has extended its liability insurance to meet the 
requirements of the regulation, no assurance can be given that other laws, regulations, or policies will not be 
applied, modified or amended in a manner that has a material adverse effect on Ryanair's business, operating 
results, and financial condition.
 Airline Industry Margins are Subject to Significant Uncertainty. The airline industry is capital intensive and is 
characterized by high fixed costs and by revenues that generally exhibit substantially greater elasticity than costs. 
Although fuel accounted for approximately 46% of total operating expenses in the 2014 fiscal year, management 
anticipates that this percentage may vary significantly in future years. See "-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel 
Availability Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood of Adverse Impact on the Company's 
Profitability" above. The operating costs of each flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers flown, 
and therefore, a relatively small change in the number of passengers, fare pricing, or traffic mix could have a 
disproportionate effect on operating and financial results. Accordingly, a relatively minor shortfall from expected 
revenue levels could have a material adverse effect on the Company's growth or financial performance. See "Item 
5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects." The very low marginal costs incurred for providing services to 
passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats are also a factor in the industry's high

Body
 Over the last year we have made considerable improvements to our business and the extraordinary people at 
Ryanair continue to work hard on behalf of shareholders to reduce costs while at the same time delivering the 
lowest fares along with the best customer service in Europe to our 86m passengers.
 Yours sincerely,
 David Bonderman
 Chairman
 Chief Executive's Report
 Dear Shareholders,
 We are pleased to present the 2014 report from Europe's biggest low fares airline and the world's favourite 
international scheduled carrier.  Over the past 12 months, Ryanair's unique low fares, low cost model, continued to 
deliver new route and traffic growth, albeit at lower fares, which meant that while we carried a record 81.7m  
customers, our average fare fell by 4% to EUR46.40 causing a disappointing 8% decline in profits from last year's 
record EUR569m, to a slightly more modest EUR523m this year.
 While any decline in net profits is disappointing, the fact is that this fall was not caused by a cost problem, but 
rather by offering our customers even lower fares than last year.  Our history has shown that customers who obtain 
lower air fares and great customer service, will continue to return to Ryanair again and again as we roll out exciting 
plans to grow our fleet, expand our route network, improve our flight times and frequencies, and continuously 
improve the customer experience on Ryanair.
 In the last year traffic rose by 3% to 81.7m customers, average fares fell by 4% (to EUR46.40), but ancillary 
revenues grew strongly (up 17%) with the result that revenue per passenger was largely flat.  Excluding fuel (which 
rose by 7%), sector length adjusted unit costs fell by 3% proving again Ryanair's disciplined approach to cost 
containment.  The key trend over the last year is that the average fare and  unit cost gap between Ryanair and our 
European competitor airlines widened (as they saw their unit costs and fares rise) and it is this wider price gap 
which will underpin Ryanair's strong traffic and profit growth over the coming years.
 Over the last 12 months Ryanair opened 121 new routes, announced 8 new bases in Athens, Thessaloniki, 
Brussels (Zaventem), Lisbon, Rome (Fiumicino), Catania, Lamezia and Palermo.  We also obtained shareholder 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -2-
approval for our 180 new aircraft order, deliveries of which will start in September 2014, enabling Ryanair to grow 
our traffic from 82m to over 110m customers over the next 5 years.
 Improving our Customer Experience
 In September 2013, we announced plans to significantly improve our customer experience.  For many years, 
success was defined by having the lowest costs and the lowest fares in every market, which ensured that we grew 
rapidly establishing enormous price (and cost) leadership over Europe's flag carriers, and so called low cost 
carriers, all of whom charge air fares that are at least 50% higher than Ryanair.  As our business matures, and our 
growth rates slow somewhat, we are committed to improving our customer experience in addition to providing our 
guests with the lowest fares, the most on-time flights, the fewest lost bags, and the fewest cancellations.
 To achieve these goals we have spent a lot of the past year listening to our customers, and responding to their 
advice on improving our customer experience by moving to fully allocated seating on all flights, launching a simpler, 
easier to use, website with great new features which makes finding our routes, timetables and lowest fares quicker 
and easier than ever.
 We have also restructured many long standing policies to allow customers bring a small second carry-on bag free 
of charge, a 24 hour grace period to correct minor booking errors, reduced boarding card and airport bag fees, 
"quiet flights" on early morning and late evening services for those customers who wish to chill out or snooze. We 
have also launched a dedicated groups service, an exciting new family product which allows children to avail of 
discounted prices for allocated seats, travel insurance and checked bags.  In the Autumn we will launch a new 
business service which will allow business customers avail of exciting new benefits including flexible tickets, fast-
track through security at many airports, reserved seating and free checked in bags, all for a small premium on our 
very low fares. These efforts have been complimented with a brand new Ryanair mobile app which was launched in 
mid July and will make Ryanair's fares and services even more accessible to customers on the go.
 We have widened the availability and distribution of Ryanair's low fares and flights with a return to GDS distribution 
via new partnerships with Travelport (the operator of the Galileo and Worldspan GDS's), with Google Flight Search 
feature here in Europe, and the brilliant "fare finder" facility on our website (which allows customers to readily find 
our lowest fares, our price promotions, or to enter a range of prices and we then produce the range of destinations 
that they can travel to at these price points).
 Our airport partnerships
 Over the past year there has been a noticeable change in our airport strategy.  For many years we focused our 
growth on low cost services to secondary airports at primary cities, or primary airports in regional cities, where low 
costs and efficient facilities were readily available.
 Over the last 12 months an increasing number of major city primary airports are offering Ryanair low costs and 
efficient facilities in return for new route and/or traffic growth on existing routes, in many cases to make up for traffic 
declines at those primary airports by their incumbent carriers.
 This has seen Ryanair announce new bases and growth at a number of primary airports last year including long-
term incentive schemes at London Stansted and Dublin (where we applaud the Irish Government's decision to 
scrap the damaging travel tax), and we have also welcomed new primary airports to our network including Athens, 
Brussels Zaventem, Lisbon, Rome Fiumicino, Cologne, Gdansk, Warsaw Modlin and Glasgow Intl. among others.  
While many of these airports are slightly more expensive than our 186 existing airports, our experience has shown 
that passengers at these airports prefer Ryanair's low fares over the much higher fares being charged by other so 
called low cost carriers, or flag carriers, and so they switch to Ryanair in significant numbers to make significant 
savings on their travel costs.
 We will continue to roll out new products, new services and new routes, as we make the customer experience 
when flying with Ryanair the best in the business.  We plan to reduce the cost of flying for individual customers, for 
families and for businesses.  We will offer more choice of services, with an increasing range of flights to/from many 
of Europe's primary airports, and we will continue to offer Europe's consumers lower fares than all other airlines, as 
well as a better customer experience.
 Digital
 While the Ryanair.com website is Europe's largest travel website, we have been slow over the past year or two to 
invest or improve our website, and to address new mobile technology as it develops rapidly.  As a result we have 
allowed higher fare competitors to develop better websites and mobile platforms than those of Ryanair.  This will not 
happen again.  Over the last year we have transformed the Ryanair.com website to make it easier to use, and we 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -2-
have launched a great new mobile app which makes Ryanair's fares, flights and ancillary services readily available 
to our customers on smartphones, laptops and other mobile devices.
 We are not content to rest on these laurels.  We are actively developing our Ryanair Labs team which will be 
charged with developing Ryanair's presence on all digital platforms, expanding the range of services we offer, 
entering into partnerships with other digital leaders, and investing in emerging trends such as wearable devices, 
travel package holidays and related products and services.
 Our people
 Over the past year average numbers employed in Ryanair rose from 9,059 to 9,501.  Of this number more than 
560 people were promoted as our growth created new opportunities for promotion, career progression and 
development. Despite the difficult economic environment, and a decline in profits, we agreed a modest pay increase 
in April for our team.  We have also negotiated 5 year pay and condition deals with our cabin crew bases and 12 of 
our pilot bases, directly with our people, when their previous 5 year deals ended in March.
 We were pleased to move into our new Dublin offices in January 2014, where we have created an exciting and 
engaging environment for all our people and which affords us the space to grow our team and invest in IT and 
digital specialists.  We are pleased that Ryanair's new offices (which were designed by our people) were recently 
ranked one of Ireland's top 8 "coolest office spaces" and we hope that many shareholders will take the time to visit 
us in our great new space over the coming months.
 Our Shareholders
 Unlike other airlines, Ryanair continues to deliver substantial returns for our shareholders.  Because our Board and 
Management team own a significant stake in the airline, we think, we plan, we invest, and we act like shareholders 
because we are significant shareholders.
 Over the past year, we completed share buybacks of over EUR480m and, subject to shareholder approval at the 
forthcoming AGM, we plan to pay a third special dividend of approx. EUR520m to shareholders in Q4 of this fiscal 
year.
 We recently completed our first unsecured eurobond debt facility, raising EUR850m for a 7 year period at fixed 
interest rates of less than 2%.  We will face significant aircraft capex payments over the next 12 months, and once 
we have completed this significant investment, we will look again to improve shareholder returns both by growing 
our profits and share price, and by completing more share buybacks and special dividends when our net cash 
position allows us to do so.

Body
 Commitments resulting from the use of derivative financial instruments by the Company are described in 
Notes 5 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
 Contingencies
 The Company is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business. Management does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Company. Should the Company be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or financial position.
 In February 2004, the European Commission ruled that Ryanair had received illegal state aid from the 
Walloon regional government in connection with its establishment of a low cost base at Brussels 
(Charleroi). Ryanair advised the regional government that it believed no money was repayable as the cost 
of establishing the base exceeded the amount determined to be illegal state aid. Ryanair also appealed the 
decision of the European Commission to the European Court of First Instance ("CFI"), requesting that the 
Court annul the decision on the basis that Ryanair's agreement at Brussels (Charleroi) was consistent with 
agreements at similar privately owned airports and therefore did not constitute illegal state aid. The 
Company placed EUR4.0 million in an escrow account pending the outcome of this appeal. In December 2008, 
the CFI annulled the Commission's decision against Charleroi Airport and Ryanair was repaid the EUR4 
million that the Commission had claimed was illegal state aid. A further action taken by the Belgian 
government for EUR2.3 million has also been withdrawn.
 Ryanair is facing similar legal challenges with respect to agreements with certain other airports. In 
January 2010, the European Commission concluded the Bratislava state aid investigation with a finding that 
Ryanair's agreement with Bratislava airport involved no aid.  In July 2012 the European Commission found 
that Ryanair's arrangement with Tampere airport contained no aid.  In February 2014 the European 
Commission reached the same conclusion in respect of Marseille, Aarhus and Berlin (Schönefeld) 
investigations.  On July 23, 2014 the European Commission announced a 'no state aid' decision in respect 
of Dusseldorf (Weeze) airport, as well as findings of state aid to Ryanair in its arrangements with Pau, 
Nimes and Angouleme airports, ordering Ryanair to repay a total of approximately EUR9.7m of alleged aid.  
Ryanair will appeal these 'aid' decisions to the EU General Court where proceedings are expected to take 
between 2 and 4 years.  The remaining fourteen investigations involving Ryanair and Lübeck, Alghero, 
Frankfurt (Hahn), Zweibrücken, Altenburg, Klagenfurt, (Stockholm) Vasteras, Paris (Beauvais), La Rochelle, 
Carcassonne, Cagliari, Brussels (Charleroi), Girona and Reusairports are ongoing and Ryanair currently 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -92-
expects that they will conclude mid to late 2014, with any European Commission decisions appealable to the 
EU General Court.
 State aid complaints by Lufthansa about Ryanair's cost base at Frankfurt (Hahn) have been rejected by 
German courts, as have similar complaints by Air Berlin in relation to Ryanair's arrangement with Lubeck 
airport, but following a German Supreme Court ruling on a procedural issue in early 2011, these cases will 
be  re-heard by lower courts. In addition, Ryanair has been involved in legal challenges including 
allegations of state aid at Alghero,  Berlin (Schönefeld) and Marseille airports. The Alghero case 
(initiated by Air One) was dismissed in its entirety in April 2011. The Berlin (Schönefeld) case 
(initiated by Germania) was discontinued following the European Commission's finding in February 2014 that 
Ryanair's arrangement with the airport contained no state aid.  The Marseille case was withdrawn by the 
plaintiffs (subsidiaries of Air France) in May 2011.
 The Company has also entered into a series of interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations in 
interest rates for certain floating-rate financing arrangements. Cash deposits have been set aside as 
collateral for the counterparty's exposure to risk of fluctuations on long-term derivative and other 
financing arrangements with Ryanair (restricted cash) (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 
for further details). Additional numerical information on these swaps and on other derivatives held by the 
Company is set out in Notes 5 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

 25           Dividends and share buy-backs
 In the year ended March 31, 2014 the Company bought back 69.5 million ordinary shares (including just 
over 6.0 million American Depository Receipts (ADR's) which each represented five ordinary shares)  at a 
total cost of EUR481.7 million.  This is equivalent to approximately 4.8% of the Company's issued share 
capital at March 31, 2013. All ordinary shares repurchased have been cancelled. Accordingly, share capital 
decreased by 69.5 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.4 million and the capital 
redemption reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.4 million.  The capital redemption reserve is 
required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 On June 20, 2013 the Company detailed plans to return up to EUR1.0 billion to shareholders over the 
following two years. At March 31, 2014 EUR481.7 million has been completed via share buybacks and up to 
EUR520 million in special dividends is planned to be returned in the fiscal year 2015 (subject to 
profitability and shareholder approval at the AGM on September 25, 2014).
 26           Post-balance sheet events
 On April 30, 2014, the Company agreed to purchase an additional 5 Boeing 737 800 "Next Generation" 
aircraft for delivery in fiscal 2016, bringing the total number of aircraft to be purchased from Boeing to 
180 for delivery between fiscal year 2015 and 2019, with a list value of approximately $14.1 billion.
 In the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, the Company entered into 8 short-term aircraft leases between 
May and September 2014 to support the capacity requirements prior to delivery of new aircraft in September 
2014.
 On May 19, 2014, the Company indicated that it plans to pay a special dividend of up to EUR520 million in 
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, subject to shareholder approval at its annual general meeting on 
September 25, 2014.
 On June 10, 2014, Ryanair issued an unsecured EUR850.0 million eurobond at a fixed coupon of 1.875%, 
fixed for 7 years. Under Ryanair's EUR3 billion EMTN program Ryanair Holdings guarantees any issuance of 
notes,  including Ryanair's issuance of an EUR850.0 million eurobond in June 2014.

Body
 During 2009, Ryanair introduced Internet check-in for all passengers and also introduced kiosks at certain airports 
for the provision of other services. The Company has these kiosks in operation at many of its key bases.
 Airport Charges
 As with other airlines, Ryanair must pay airport charges each time it lands and accesses facilities at the airports it 
serves. Depending on the policy of the individual airport, such charges can include landing fees, passenger loading 
fees, security fees and parking fees. Ryanair attempts to negotiate discounted fees by delivering annual increases 
in passenger traffic, and opts, when practicable, for less expensive facilities, such as less convenient gates and the 
use of outdoor boarding stairs rather than more expensive jetways. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that 
the airports Ryanair uses will not impose higher airport charges in the future and that any such increases would not 
adversely affect the Company's operations.
 As a result of rising airport charges and the introduction of an Air Travel Tax of EUR10 on passengers departing 
from Irish airports on routes longer than 300 kilometers from Dublin Airport (EUR2 on shorter routes), Ryanair 
reduced its fleet at Dublin airport to 13 during winter 2010 (down from 22 in summer 2008 and 20 in winter 2008). 
The introduction of the aforementioned EUR10 tax likely had a negative impact on the number of passengers 
traveling to and from Ireland. The Dublin Airport Authority ("DAA") reported that passenger volumes declined by 
25% from 30 million in 2007 to 23 million in 2012. Ryanair believes that this is partly reflective of the negative 
impact of the tax on Irish travel. Ryanair called for the elimination of the tax to stimulate tourism during the 
recession. Ryanair also complained to the European Commission about the unlawful differentiation in the level of 
the Irish Air Travel tax between routes within the EU. From April 2011, a single rate (EUR3) of the Air Travel Tax 
was introduced on all routes. In May 2011, the Irish Government announced that it would abolish the Air Travel Tax, 
and the tax was ultimately abolished on April 1, 2014. No assurance can be given that the tax will not be 
reintroduced in the future at similar levels or higher levels, which could have a negative impact on demand for air 
travel.
 The Greek government planned to introduce similar taxes; however, it has now cancelled plans to introduce these 
taxes. The German government introduced an EUR8 passenger tax on January 1, 2011 for all departing domestic 
or short-haul passengers and a passenger tax of EUR25 for all departing passengers on flights bound for southern 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -30-
Europe and northern Africa. The EUR8 tax was reduced to EUR7.50 in January 2012. In addition, the Austrian 
government introduced an ecological air travel levy of EUR8 effective January 1, 2011. In July 2013, the regional 
Walloon Government in Belgium announced a EUR3 passenger travel tax from January 2014. However, the plan to 
introduce this tax was later abandoned. The Moroccan government has also introduced a similar tax (equivalent to 
approximately EUR9) from April 2014.
 In March 2007, the discount arrangement formerly in place at London (Stansted) airport terminated, subjecting 
Ryanair to an average increase in charges of approximately 100%. The increase in these charges, which was 
passed on in the form of higher ticket prices, had a negative impact on yields and passenger volumes in the winter, 
resulting in Ryanair's decision to ground seven aircraft. Ryanair responded to the increases by filing complaints with 
the U.K. Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") and the Competition Commission, calling for the break-up of the British 
Airports Authority plc ("BAA") monopoly and the introduction of competition in the London airports market. The OFT 
referred the matter to the Competition Commission, which found that the common ownership by BAA of the three 
main airports in London negatively affected competition and that a "light touch" approach to regulating BAA by the 
Civil Aviation Authority adversely impacted competition. In March 2009, the Competition Commission ordered the 
break-up of BAA. In October 2009, London (Gatwick) was sold to Global Infrastructure Partners for GBP1.5 billion. 
Following a delay caused by various appeals by the BAA, the BAA proceeded to sell Edinburgh Airport in April 
2012, and Stansted airport to Manchester Airports Group plc in March 2013. Following the December 2003 
publication of the U.K. government's White Paper on Airport Capacity in the Southeast of England, the BAA in 2004 
announced plans to spend up to GBP4 billion on a multi-year project to construct a second runway and additional 
terminal facilities at London (Stansted) airport with a target opening date of 2013. Ryanair and other airlines using 
London (Stansted) support the principle of a second runway at London (Stansted), but are opposed to this 
development because they believe that the financing of what they consider to be an overblown project will lead to 
airport costs approximately doubling from current levels. In May 2010 the BAA announced that it would not proceed 
with this GBP4 billion program. On January 10, 2014, the UK Civil Aviation Authority completed its regulatory 
investigation into market power determination for passenger airlines in relation to London (Stansted). It found that 
London (Stansted) did not enjoy substantial market power in the market for the provision of airport operation 
services to passenger airlines, and as such declined to continue to regulate the airport. On September 16, 2013, 
Ryanair announced that it had agreed a 10 year growth agreement with Manchester Airports Group plc, the owners 
of London (Stansted), in relation to an expansion of capacity at London (Stansted) in return for significant airport 
charge reductions for the incremental passenger volumes delivered.  Once this 10 year growth deal expires, 
Ryanair may be subject to increased airport charges at London (Stansted) as the airport is no longer subject to 
regulation.

Access to Suitable Airports; Charges for Airport Access are Subject to Increase." See also "Item 8. Financial 
Information 3/4 Other Financial Information 3/4 Legal Proceedings 3/4 EU State Aid-Related Proceedings" for 
information regarding legal proceedings in which Ryanair's economic arrangements with several publicly owned 
airports are being contested.
 FUEL
 The cost of jet fuel accounted for approximately 46% and 45% of Ryanair's total operating expenses in the fiscal 
years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively (in each case, this accounts for costs after giving effect to the 
Company's fuel hedging activities but excludes de-icing costs, which accounted for approximately 0.3% and 1.0% 
of total fuel costs in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively). The future availability and cost 
of jet fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, and Ryanair's low-fares policy limits its ability to pass on 
increased fuel costs to passengers through increased fares. Jet fuel prices are dependent on crude oil prices, which 
are quoted in U.S. dollars. If the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens against the euro, Ryanair's fuel costs, 
expressed in euro, may increase even absent any increase in the U.S. dollar price of jet fuel. Ryanair has also 
entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against some currency fluctuations. See "Item 11. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Exposure and Hedging."
 Ryanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel 
prices, generally through forward contracts covering periods of up to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel requirements. 
As of July 25, 2014, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts covering approximately 90% 
of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015 at prices equivalent to approximately $950 
per metric ton. In addition, as of July 25, 2014, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -30-
covering approximately 55% of its estimated requirements for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 
at prices equivalent to approximately $950 per metric ton, and had not entered into any jet fuel hedging contracts 
with respect to its expected fuel purchases beyond that period. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks

  Attacks on the United States Had a Severe Negative Impact on the International Airline Industry."
 RECENT OPERATING RESULTS
 The Company's profit after tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 (the first quarter of the Company's 
2014 fiscal year) was EUR196.8 million, as compared to EUR78.1 million for the corresponding period of the 
previous year. The Company recorded an increase in operating profit, from EUR103.3 million in the first 
quarter of the 2014 fiscal year to EUR231.8 million in the recently completed quarter. Total operating 
revenues increased from EUR1,342.2 million in the first quarter of 2014 to EUR1,495.7 million in the first 
quarter of 2015. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to a 9% increase in average fares and 
a stronger load factor (up 4 points to 86%) and a 2% increase in total operating expenses. Operating 
expenses increased from EUR1,238.9 million in the first quarter of 2014 to EUR1,263.9 million in the first 
quarter of 2015, due primarily to the 2% decrease in fuel costs and an increase in other operating costs 
associated with a higher level of activity in line with the growth of the airline. The Company's cash and 
cash equivalents, restricted cash and financial assets with terms of less than three months amounted to 
EUR4,483.3 million at June 30, 2014 as compared with EUR3,592.7 million at June 30, 2013.
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 The following discussion and analysis of Ryanair's financial condition and results of operations is based 
on its consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 18 and prepared in accordance with 
IFRS.
 The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.
 The Company believes that its critical accounting policies, which are those that require management's 
most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, are those described in this section. These critical 
accounting policies, the judgments and other uncertainties affecting application of these policies and the 
sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions are factors to be considered in 
reviewing the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 and the discussion and analysis below. 
For additional detail on these policies, see Note 1, "Basis of preparation and significant accounting 
policies," to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18.
 Long-lived Assets
 As of March 31, 2014, Ryanair had EUR5.1 billion of long-lived assets, virtually all of which were 
aircraft. In accounting for long-lived assets, Ryanair must make estimates about the expected useful lives 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -37-
of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the 
fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate.
 In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, Ryanair has primarily relied on its 
own and industry experience, recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of all of the Company's 
aircraft, valuations from appraisers and other available marketplace information. Subsequent revisions to 
these estimates, which can be significant, could be caused by changes to Ryanair's maintenance program, 
changes in utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging of aircraft, changes in new 
aircraft technology, changes in governmental and environmental taxes, changes in new aircraft fuel 
efficiency and changing market prices for new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. Ryanair 
evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each reporting period, and, when warranted, adjusts these 
assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis, through depreciation 
expense.
 Ryanair periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate 
potential impairment would include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of 
an aircraft, a significant change in an aircraft's physical condition and operating or cash flow losses 
associated with the use of the aircraft. While the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of 
these factors from time to time, Ryanair has not yet been seriously impacted and continues to record 
positive cash flows from these long-lived assets. Consequently, Ryanair has not yet identified any 
impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its long-lived 
assets and the general airline operating environment.
 The Company's estimate of the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values is 15% of current market 
value of new aircraft, determined periodically, based on independent valuations and actual aircraft 
disposals during prior periods. Aircraft are depreciated over a useful life of 23 years from the date of 
manufacture to residual value.
 Heavy Maintenance
 An element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed, on acquisition, to its service potential, 
reflecting the maintenance condition of the engines and airframe.
 For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, Ryanair is contractually committed to either return 
the aircraft in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the 
airframe, engines and life-limited parts upon return. In order to fulfill such conditions of the lease, 
maintenance, in the form of major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major 
life-limited parts, is required to be performed during the period of the lease and upon return of the 
aircraft to the lessor. The estimated airframe and engine maintenance costs and the costs associated with 
the restitution of major life-limited parts, are accrued and charged to profit or loss over the lease term 
for this contractual obligation, based on the present value of the estimated future cost of the major 
airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks and restitution of major life-limited parts, calculated by 
reference to the number of hours flown or cycles operated during the year.
 Ryanair's aircraft operating lease agreements typically have a term of seven years, which closely 
correlates with the timing of heavy maintenance checks. The contractual obligation to maintain and 
replenish aircraft held under operating lease exists independently of any future actions within the 
control of Ryanair. While Ryanair may, in very limited circumstances, sub-lease its aircraft, it remains 
fully liable to perform all of its contractual obligations under the 'head lease' notwithstanding any such 
sub-leasing.
 Both of these elements of accounting policies involve the use of estimates in determining the quantum of 
both the initial maintenance asset and/or the amount of provisions to be recorded and the respective 
periods over which such amounts are charged to income. In making such estimates, Ryanair has primarily 
relied on its own and industry experience, industry regulations and recommendations from Boeing; however, 
these estimates can be subject to revision, depending on a number of factors, such as the timing of the 
planned maintenance, the ultimate utilization of the aircraft, changes to government regulations and 
increases or decreases in estimated costs. Ryanair evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each 
reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts its assumptions, which generally impact maintenance and 
depreciation expense in the income statement on a prospective basis.
 Tax Audits
 Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.  Current tax payable on 
taxable profits is recognised as an expense in the period in which the profits arise using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  Deferred tax is provided in full, using the 
balance sheet liability method on temporary differences arising from the tax basis of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements.
 Social insurance, passenger taxes and sales taxes are recorded as a liability based on laws enacted in 
the jurisdictions to which they relate. Liabilities are recorded when an obligation has been incurred.
 Ryanair reviews its tax obligations by jurisdiction regularly.  There are many complexities and 
judgements in determining tax obligations due to the inherent complexity of tax law, the manner in which 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -37-
airline businesses are carried out whereby operations can begin and end in different jurisdictions and 
assumptions made about the timing and amount of individual balances to be included in financial statements 
and tax returns.
 Ryanair has an internal tax group and takes professional advice on more complex matters in estimating its 
tax liabilities.  Ryanair also deals extensively with revenue authorities in each jurisdiction in which it 
operates.   Tax liabilities are based on the best estimate of the likely obligation at each reporting 
period.  These estimates are subject to revision based on the outcome of tax audits and discussions with 
revenue authorities that can take several years to conclude.

 Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the U.S. dollar amount of dividends received by 
an individual on or post January 1, 2013 with respect to the Ordinary Shares or ADRs will be subject to taxation at a 
maximum rate of 20% if the dividends are "qualified dividends" (apart from the Medicare contribution tax referred to 
below), and the individual has taxable income that exceeds certain thresholds. Dividends paid on the Ordinary 
Shares or ADRs will be treated as qualified dividends if (i) the issuer is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive 
income tax treaty with the United States that the Internal Revenue Service has approved for the purposes of the 
qualified dividend rules and (ii) the Company was not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, 
and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a passive foreign investment company (a "PFIC"). The income 
tax treaty between Ireland and the United States has been approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend 
rules. Effective January 1, 2013, a Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% may also be applicable to U.S. individuals, 
estates and trusts. Based on the Company's audited financial statements and relevant market data, the Company 
believes that it was not treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2013/14 taxable 
year. 
In addition, based on the Company's audited financial statements and its current expectations regarding the value 
and nature of its assets, the sources and nature of its income, and relevant market data, the Company does not 
anticipate becoming a PFIC for its 2014/15 taxable year.Under the U.S.-Ireland Income Tax Treaty currently in 
effect, in the event the Company were to pay any dividend, the tax credit attaching to the dividend (as used herein 
the "Tax Credit"; see "-Irish Tax Considerations") generally will be treated as a foreign income tax eligible for credit 
against such U.S. Holder's United States federal income tax liability, subject to generally applicable limitations and 
conditions. Any such dividend paid by the Company to such U.S. Holder will constitute income from sources outside 
the United States for foreign tax credit purposes, and generally will constitute "passive category" income for such 
purposes.
 Foreign tax credits may not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term or hedged 
positions in securities.
 U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the implications of these rules in light of their 
particular circumstances.

 Distributions of Ordinary Shares that are made as part of a pro rata distribution to all stockholders generally will not 
be subject to U.S. federal income tax.
 Taxation of Capital Gains
 Sale or Disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs. Gains or losses realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other 
disposition of ADRs generally will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as capital gains or losses, which 
generally will be long-term capital gains or losses if the ADRs have been held for more than one year. The net 
amount of long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder post January 1, 2013 generally is subject to 
taxation at a maximum rate of 20%. Effective January 1, 2013, a Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% may also be 
applicable to U.S. individuals, estates and trusts. Gains realized by a U.S. Holder generally will constitute income 
from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit purposes and generally will constitute "passive category" 
income for such purposes. The deductibility of capital losses, in excess of capital gains, is subject to limitations.
 Deposits and withdrawals of Ordinary Shares by U.S. Holders in exchange for ADRs will not result in the realization 
of gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 Non-U.S. Holders. A holder of Ordinary Shares or ADRs that is, with respect to the United States, a foreign 
corporation or a nonresident alien individual (a "Non-U.S. Holder") generally will not be subject to U.S. federal 
income or withholding tax on dividends received on such Ordinary Shares or ADRs unless such income is 
effectively connected with the conduct by such holder of a trade or business in the United States. A Non-U.S. 
Holder of ADRs or Ordinary Shares will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax in respect of 
gain realized on the sale or other disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs, unless (i) such gain is effectively 
connected with the conduct by such holder of a trade or business in the United States or (ii) in the case of gain 
realized by an individual Non-U.S. Holder, such Non-U.S. Holder is present in the United States for 183 days or 
more in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions are met.

 Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 GENERAL
 Ryanair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and currency 
exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Ryanair is to minimize the negative impact of 
commodity price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Company's earnings, cash flows and 
equity.
 To manage these risks, Ryanair uses various derivative financial instruments, including cross currency interest rate 
swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and commodity forwards. These derivative financial instruments are 
generally held to maturity and are not actively traded. The Company enters into these arrangements with the goal of 
hedging its operational and balance sheet risk. However, Ryanair's exposure to commodity price, interest rate and 
currency exchange rate fluctuations cannot be neutralized completely.
 In executing its risk management strategy, Ryanair currently enters into forward contracts for the purchase of some 
of the jet fuel (jet kerosene) that it expects to use. It also uses foreign currency forward contracts intended to reduce 
its exposure to risks related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, it enters into interest rate 
contracts with the objective of fixing certain borrowing costs and hedging principal repayments, particularly those 
associated with the purchase of new Boeing 737-800s. Ryanair is also exposed to the risk that the counterparties to 
its derivative financial instruments may not be creditworthy. Were a counterparty to default on its obligations under 
any of the instruments described below, Ryanair's economic expectations when entering into these arrangements 
might not be achieved and its financial condition could be adversely affected. Transactions involving derivative 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -58-
financial instruments are also relatively illiquid as compared with those involving other kinds of financial instruments. 
It is Ryanair's policy not to enter into transactions involving financial derivatives for speculative purposes.
 The following paragraphs describe Ryanair's fuel hedging, foreign currency and interest rate swap arrangements 
and analyze the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of the financial instruments to hypothetical 
changes in commodity prices, interest rates and exchange rates as if these changes had occurred at March 31, 
2014. The range of changes selected for this sensitivity analysis reflects Ryanair's view of the changes that are 
reasonably possible over a one-year period.
 FUEL PRICE EXPOSURE AND HEDGING
 Fuel costs constitute a substantial portion of Ryanair's operating expenses (approximately 46.0% and 45.3% of 
such expenses in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively, after taking into account Ryanair's fuel hedging 
activities). Ryanair engages in fuel price hedging transactions from time to time, pursuant to which Ryanair and a 
counterparty agree to exchange payments equal to the difference between a fixed price for a given quantity of jet 
fuel and the market price for such quantity of jet fuel at a given date in the future, with Ryanair receiving the amount 
of any excess of such market price over such fixed price and paying to the counterparty the amount of any deficit of 
such fixed price under such market price.
 Ryanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel 
prices, generally through forward contracts covering periods of up to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel requirements. 
See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel 
Availability Affect the Company's Results and Increases the Likelihood that the Company May Incur Losses" for 
additional information on recent trends in fuel costs and the Company's related hedging activities, as well as certain 
associated risks. See also "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Fiscal Year 2014 Compared 
with Fiscal Year 2013-Fuel and Oil." As of July 25, 2014, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) 
contracts covering approximately 90% of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015 at 
prices equivalent to approximately $950 per metric ton. In addition, as of July 25, 2014, Ryanair had entered into 
forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts covering approximately 55% of its estimated requirements for the first half 
of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 at prices equivalent to approximately $950 per metric ton, and had not 
entered into any jet fuel

 Independence. NASDAQ requires that a majority of an issuer's Board of Directors be "independent" under the 
standards set forth in the NASDAQ rules and that directors deemed independent be identified in the Company's 
annual report on Form 20-F. The Board of Directors has determined that each of the Company's nine non-executive 
directors is "independent" under the standards set forth in the UK Corporate Governance Code.  Under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, there is no bright-line test establishing set criteria for independence, as there is under 
NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(12). Instead, the Board of Directors determines whether the director is "independent in 
character and judgment," and whether there are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could 
appear to affect, the director's judgment. Under the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board of Directors may 
determine that a director is independent notwithstanding the existence of relationships or circumstances which may 
appear relevant to its determination, but it should state its reasons if it makes such a determination. The UK 
Corporate Governance Code specifies that relationships or circumstances that may be relevant include whether the 
director: (i) has been an employee of the relevant company or group within the last five years; (ii) has had within the 
last three years a direct or indirect material business relationship with such company; (iii) has received payments 
from such company, subject to certain exceptions; (iv) has close family ties with any of the company's advisers, 
directors or senior employees; (v) holds cross-directorships or other significant links with other directors; (vi) 
represents a significant shareholder; or (vii) has served on the Board of Directors for more than nine years. 
In determining that each of the nine non-executive directors is independent under the UK Corporate Governance 
Code standard, the Ryanair Holdings Board of Directors identified such relevant factors with respect to non-
executive directors Messrs. Bonderman, McLaughlin, Osborne and Horgan. The Board has considered Kyran 
McLaughlin's independence given his role as Deputy Chairman and Head of Capital Markets at Davy Stockbrokers. 
Davy Stockbrokers are one of Ryanair's corporate brokers and provide corporate advisory services to Ryanair from 
time to time. The Board has considered the fees paid to Davy Stockbrokers for these services and believe that they 
are immaterial to both Ryanair and Davy Stockbrokers given the size of each organisation's business operations 
and financial results. Having considered this relationship, the Board has concluded that Kyran McLaughlin 
continues to be an independent non-executive director within the spirit and meaning of the 2012 Code Rules. The 
Board has also considered the independence of David Bonderman given his shareholding in Ryanair Holdings plc. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -46-
As at March 31, 2014, David Bonderman had a beneficial shareholding in the Company of 7,655,671 ordinary 
shares, equivalent to 0.55% of the issued share capital. Having considered this shareholding in light of the number 
of issued shares in Ryanair Holdings plc and the financial interest of the director, the Board has concluded that the 
interest is not so material as to breach the spirit of the independence rule contained in the 2012 Code. The Board 
has further considered the independence of Messrs. David Bonderman, James Osborne, Kyran McLaughlin and 
Michael Horgan as they have each served more than nine years on the Board. The Board considers that each of 
these directors is independent in character and judgment as they either have other significant commercial and 
professional commitments and/or brings his own level of senior experience gained in their fields of international 
business and professional practice. When arriving at this decision, the Board has taken into account the comments 
made by the Financial Reporting Council in their report dated December, 2009 on their review of the impact and 
effectiveness of the Code, in particular their comment that independence is not the primary consideration when 
assessing the composition of the Board, and that the over-riding consideration should be that the Board is fit for 
purpose. For these reasons, and also because each director's independence is considered annually by the Board, 
the Board considers it appropriate that these directors have not been offered for annual re-election as is 
recommended by the 2012 Code. When arriving at the decision that these directors are nonetheless independent, 
the Board of Directors has taken into account the comments made by the Financial Reporting Council in its report 
dated December 2009 on its review of the impact and effectiveness of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The 
NASDAQ independence criteria specifically state that an individual may not be considered independent if, within the 
last three years, such individual or a member of his or her immediate family has had certain specified relationships 
with the company, its parent, any consolidated subsidiary, its internal or external auditors, or any company that has 
significant business relationships with the company, its parent or any consolidated subsidiary. Neither ownership of 
a significant amount of stock nor length of service on the board is a per se bar to independence under the NASDAQ 
rules.

Body
 European Commission. The European Commission is in the process of introducing an updated legislative package 
to its "single European sky policy," called "SES2+", which would lead to changes to air traffic management and 
control within the EU.  The "single European sky policy" currently consists of the Framework Regulation (Reg. (EC) 
No. 549/2004) plus three technical regulations on the provision of air navigation services, organization and use of 
the airspace and the inter-operability of the European air traffic management network. These regulations have 
recently been amended by the so-called "Single European Sky II" regulation (EU Regulation 1070/09), which 
focused on air traffic control ("ATC") performance and extended the authority of EASA to include Airports and Air 
Traffic Management. The objective of the policy is to enhance safety standards and the overall efficiency of air 
traffic in Europe, as well as to reduce the cost of air traffic control services.
 On September 6, 2005, the European Commission announced new guidelines on the financing of airports and 
start-up aid to airlines by regional airports based on its February 2004 finding in the Charleroi case, a decision that 
the EU Court of First Instance ("CFI") has since annulled in December 2008. The guidelines only apply to publicly 
owned regional airports, and place restrictions on the incentives that these airports can offer airlines to deliver 
traffic. Ryanair believes that the CFI's annulment of the Charleroi decision severely undermines these guidelines. In 
April 2014, the European Commission published final revised guidelines that better reflect the commercial reality of 
the liberalized air transport market, but still place restrictions on the incentives public airports can offer to airlines 
delivering traffic, when compared with the commercial freedom available to private airports.
 The European Union also adopted legislation on airport charges (EU Directive 2009/12), which was originally 
intended to address abusive pricing at monopoly airports. However, the legislation includes all European airports 
with over five million passengers per year. Management believes that this will likely increase the administrative 
burdens on smaller airports and may lead to higher airport charges, while the scope that exists within this Directive 
to address abuses of their dominant positions by Europe's larger airports is very limited. See "Item 7. Major 
Shareholders and Related-Party Transactions 3/4 Other Financial Information 3/4 Legal Proceedings 3/4 EU State 
Aid-Related Proceedings."
 The European Union also passed legislation calling for increased transparency in airline fares, which requires the 
inclusion of all mandatory taxes, fees, and charges in advertised prices. Ryanair currently includes this information 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -33-
in its advertised fares in all markets where it operates. However, certain regulatory authorities have alleged that 
some fees applied by airlines, including Ryanair, on an avoidable basis are in fact mandatory. Ryanair amended its 
website to include information on fees in June 2012 and incorporated further changes to meet these requirements 
on its website in August 2012 and December 2012.
 Registration of Aircraft
 Pursuant to the Irish Aviation Authority (Nationality and Registration of Aircraft) Order 2002 (the "Order"), the IAA 
regulates the registration of aircraft in Ireland. In order to be registered or continue to be registered in Ireland, an 
aircraft must be wholly owned by either (i) a citizen of Ireland or a citizen of another member state of the EU having 
a place of residence or business in Ireland or (ii) a company registered in and having a place of business in Ireland 
and having its principal place of business in Ireland or another member state of the EU and not less than two-thirds 
of the directors of which are citizens of Ireland or of another member state of the EU. As of the date of this report, 
nine of the ten directors of Ryanair Holdings are citizens of Ireland or of another member state of the EU. An aircraft 
will also fulfill these conditions if it is wholly owned by such citizens or companies in combination. Notwithstanding 
the fact that these particular conditions may not be met, the IAA retains discretion to register an aircraft in Ireland so 
long as it is in compliance with the other conditions for registration under the Order. Any such registration may, 
however, be made subject to certain conditions. In order to be registered, an aircraft must also continue to comply 
with any applicable provisions of Irish law. The registration of any aircraft can be cancelled if it is found that it is not 
in compliance with the requirements for registration under the Order and, in particular: (i) if the ownership 
requirements are not met; (ii) if the aircraft has failed to comply with any applicable safety requirements specified by 
the IAA in relation to the aircraft or aircraft of a similar type; or (iii) if the IAA decides in any case that it is not in the 
public interest for the aircraft to remain registered in Ireland.
 Regulation of Competition
 Competition/Antitrust Law. It is a general principle of EU competition law that no agreement may be concluded 
between two or more separate economic undertakings that prevents, restricts or distorts competition in the common 
market or any part of the common market. Such an arrangement may nevertheless be exempted by the European 
Commission, on either an individual or category basis. The second general principle of EU competition law is that 
any business or businesses having a dominant position in the EU common market or any substantial part of the 
common market may not abuse such dominant position. Similar competition laws apply at national level in EU 
member states. Ryanair is subject to the application of the general rules of EU competition law as well as specific 
rules on competition in the airline sector.
 An aggrieved person may sue for breach of EU competition law in the courts of a member state and/or petition the 
European Commission for an order to put an end to the breach of competition law. The European Commission also 
may impose fines and daily penalties on businesses and the courts of the member states may award damages and 
other remedies (such as injunctions) in appropriate circumstances.
 Competition law in Ireland is primarily embodied in the Competition Act 2002. This Act is modeled on the EU 
competition law system. The Irish rules generally prohibit anti-competitive arrangements among businesses and 
prohibit the abuse of a dominant position. These rules are enforced either by public enforcement (primarily by the 
Competition Authority) through both criminal and civil sanctions or by private action in the courts. These rules apply 
to the airline sector, but are subject to EU rules that override any contrary provisions of Irish competition law. 
Ryanair has been subject to an abuse-of-dominance investigation by the Irish Competition Authority in relation to 
service between Dublin and Cork. The Competition Authority closed its investigation in July 2009 with a finding in 
favor of Ryanair.
 State Aid. The EU rules control aid granted by member states to businesses on a selective or discriminatory basis. 
The EU Treaty prevents member states from granting such aid unless approved in advance by the EU. Any such 
grant of state aid to an airline is subject to challenge before the EU or, in certain circumstances, national courts. If 
aid is held to have been unlawfully granted it may have to be repaid by the airline to the granting member state, 
together with interest thereon. See "Item 3. Key Information 3/4 Risk Factors 3/4 Risks Related to the Company-
The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports" and "Item 8. Financial 
Information 3/4 Other Financial Information 3/4 Legal Proceedings."
 Environmental Regulation
 Aircraft Noise Regulations. Ryanair is subject to international, national and, in some cases, local noise regulation 
standards. EU and Irish regulations have required that all aircraft operated by Ryanair comply with Stage 3 noise 
requirements since April 1, 2002. All of Ryanair's aircraft currently comply with these regulations. Certain airports in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -33-
the U.K. (including London Stansted and London Gatwick) and continental Europe have established local noise 
restrictions, including limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of such operations.
 Company Facilities. Environmental controls are generally imposed under Irish law through property planning 
legislation, specifically the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts of 1963 to 1999, the Planning and 
Development Act 2000 and regulations made there under. At Dublin Airport, Ryanair operates on land controlled by 
the DAA. Planning permission for its facilities has been granted in accordance with both the zoning and planning 
requirements of Dublin Airport. There is also specific Irish environmental legislation implementing applicable EU 
directives and regulations, to which Ryanair adheres. From time to time, noxious or potentially toxic substances are 
held on a temporary basis within Ryanair's engineering facilities at Dublin Airport, Glasgow (Prestwick), London 
(Stansted), Frankfurt (Hahn), Stockholm (Skavsta), Oslo (Rygge) and Kaunas. However, at all times Ryanair's 
storage and handling of these substances complies with the relevant regulatory requirements. At Ryanair's 
Glasgow (Prestwick) and London (Stansted) maintenance facilities, all normal waste is removed in accordance with 
the Environmental Protection Act of 1996 and Duty of Care Waste Regulations. For special waste removal, Ryanair 
operates under the Special Waste Regulations 1998. At all other facilities Ryanair adheres to all local and EU 
regulations.

Body
 The Company has cash and aircraft assets and debt liabilities that are denominated in euro on its balance sheet. In 
addition, the positive/negative mark-to-market value of derivative-based transactions are recorded in euro as either 
assets or liabilities on the Company's balance sheet. Uncertainty regarding the future of the Eurozone could have a 
materially adverse effect on the value of these assets and liabilities. In addition to the assets and liabilities on 
Ryanair's balance sheet, the Company has a number of cross currency risks as a result of the jurisdictions of the 
operating business including non-euro revenues, fuel costs, certain maintenance costs and insurance costs. A 
weakening in the value of the euro primarily against U.K. pound sterling and U.S. dollar, but also against other non-
Eurozone European currencies and Moroccan Dirhams, could negatively impact the operating results of the 
Company.
 Recession, austerity and uncertainty in connection with the euro could also mean that Ryanair is unable to grow. 
The recent European recession and austerity measures still in effect in several European countries could mean that 
Ryanair may be unable to expand its operations due to lack of demand for air travel.
 Risks Related to the Airline Industry
 The Airline Industry Is Particularly Sensitive to Changes in Economic Conditions: A Continued Recessionary 
Environment Would Negatively Impact Ryanair's Result of Operations. Ryanair's operations and the airline industry 
in general are sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions such as government 
austerity measures, the uncertainty relating to the Eurozone, high unemployment rates, constrained credit markets 
and increased business operating costs could lead to reduced spending by both leisure and business passengers. 
Unfavorable economic conditions, such as the conditions persisting as of the date hereof, also tend to impact 
Ryanair's ability to raise fares to counteract increased fuel and other operating costs. A continued recessionary 
environment, combined with austerity measures by European governments, will likely negatively impact Ryanair's 
operating results. It could also restrict the Company's ability to grow passenger volumes, secure new airports and 
launch new routes and bases, and could have a material adverse impact on its financial results.
 The Introduction of Government Taxes on Travel Could Damage Ryanair's Ability to Grow and Could Have a 
Material Adverse Impact on Operations. The U.K. government levies an Air Passenger Duty ("APD") of GBP13 per 
passenger. The tax was previously set at GBP5 per passenger, but it was increased to GBP10 per passenger in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -22-
2007, GBP11 in 2009, GBP12 in 2010 and subsequently to GBP13 in April 2012.  The increase in this tax is thought 
to have had a negative impact on Ryanair's operating performance, both in terms of average fares paid and growth 
in passenger volumes. In 2008, the Dutch government introduced a travel tax ranging from EUR11 on short-haul 
flights to EUR45 on long-haul flights (withdrawn with effect from July 1, 2009). On March 30, 2009, the Irish 
government also introduced a EUR10 Air Travel Tax on all passengers departing from Irish airports on routes 
longer than 300 kilometers but subsequently reduced it to EUR3 on March 30, 2011. On April 1, 2014 the tax 
imposed by the Irish government was abolished. In Germany, the government introduced an air passenger tax of 
EUR8 in January 2011 which was subsequently reduced to EUR7.50 in January 2012. In Austria, the government 
also introduced an ecological air travel levy of EUR8 in January 2011. The Moroccan government has also 
introduced a similar tax (equivalent to approximately EUR9) from April 2014.
 Other governments also have introduced or may introduce similar taxes. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Airport Operations-Airport Charges." The introduction of government taxes on travel has had a negative impact on 
passenger volumes, particularly given the current period of decreased economic activity. The introduction of further 
government taxes on travel across Europe could have a material negative impact on Ryanair's results of operations 
as a result of price-sensitive passengers being less likely to travel.
 EU Regulation on Passenger Compensation Could Significantly Increase Related Costs. EU Regulation (EC) No. 
261/2004 requires airlines to compensate passengers (holding a valid ticket) who have been denied boarding or 
whose flight has been cancelled or delayed more than 3 hours on arrival (even where the reason for the delay or 
cancellation is beyond the control of the airline). This legislation, which came into force on February 17, 2005, 
imposes fixed levels of compensation to be paid to passengers in the event of the situations described above. In 
November 2009, the Court of Justice of the EU in the Sturgeon case decided that provisions of the legislation in 
relation to monetary compensation are not only applicable to denied boarding and flight cancellations but also to 
flight delays (over three hours on arrival). However, such provisions do not apply when the flight cancellation or 
delay (over three hours on arrival), is caused for reasons outside of the control of the airline (extraordinary 
circumstances)  such as unsafe weather conditions, air-traffic control strikes/delays, unexpected flight safety 
shortcomings, sabotage, aircraft manufacturing defects,  security risks, political instability. A recent UK court case - 
Huzar vs. Jet2 heard in the UK Court of Appeal in May 2014 has narrowed the 'extraordinary circumstances' 
defence, this case is currently on appeal to the UK Supreme Court and has a suspensory effect on all passenger 
claims brought in the UK in relation to flight delays or cancellations caused by unexpected flight safety 
shortcomings. The regulation calls for compensation of  EUR250, EUR400, or EUR600 per passenger, depending 
on the length of the flight. As Ryanair's average flight length is less than 1,500 km - the upper limit for short-haul 
flights - the amount payable is generally EUR250 per passenger. Passengers subject to flight delays over 2 hours 
are also entitled to "assistance," including meals, drinks and telephone calls, as well as hotel accommodations if the 
delay extends overnight. For delays of over five hours, the airline is also required to offer the option of a refund of 
the cost of the unused ticket. There can be no assurance that the Company will not incur a significant increase in 
costs in the future due to the impact of this legislation, if Ryanair experiences a large number of cancelled flights, 
which could occur as a result of certain types of events beyond its control. See "-Risks Related to the Airline 
Industry-Volcanic Ash Emissions Could Affect the Company and Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company's 
Results of Operations."
 EU Regulation of Emissions Trading Will Increase Costs. On November 19, 2008, the European Council of 
Ministers adopted legislation to add aviation to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme ("ETS") with effect from 2012. 
This scheme, which has thus far applied mainly to industrial companies, is a cap-and-trade system for CO(2) 
emissions to encourage industries to improve their CO(2) efficiency. Under the legislation, airlines are granted initial 
CO(2) allowances based on historical performance and a CO(2) efficiency benchmark. Any shortage of allowances 
will have to be purchased in the open market and/or at government auctions. The cost of such allowances in the 
context of the Company's energy costs are not material at current market prices. There can be no assurance that 
Ryanair will be able to obtain sufficient carbon credits or that the cost of the credits will not have a material adverse 
effect on the Company's business, operating results, and financial condition.
 Volcanic Ash Emissions Could Affect the Company and Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company's Results 
of Operations. Between April 15 and April 20, 2010 and May 4 and May 17, 2010, a significant portion of the 
airspace over northern Europe was closed by authorities as a result of safety concerns presented by emissions of 
ash from an Icelandic volcano. This closure forced Ryanair to cancel 9,490 flights. In May 2011, there were further 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -22-
periodic closures of parts of the European airspace due to emissions of ash from another Icelandic volcano, which 
resulted in the cancellation of 96 flights.
 Under the terms of Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004, described above, Ryanair has certain duties to passengers 
whose flights are cancelled. In particular, Ryanair is required to reimburse passengers who have had their flights 
cancelled for certain reasonable, documented expenses - primarily for accommodation and food.
 Volcanic emissions may happen again and could lead to further significant flight cancellation costs which could 
have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, 
volcanic emissions (whether from current or new sources) or similar atmospheric disturbances and resulting 
cancellations due to the closure of airports could also have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial 
performance indirectly, as a consequence of changes in the public's willingness to travel within Europe due to the 
risk of flight disruptions.

 ============  ============  =========
Fuel and oil. Ryanair's fuel and oil costs per passenger increased by 3.6%, while in absolute terms, these costs 
increased by 6.8% from EUR1,885.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year to EUR2,013.1 million in the 2014 fiscal year, in 
each case after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities. The 6.8% increase reflected a 3.0% increase 
in average fuel prices paid and the impact of a 7.6% increase in the number of hours flown, which were offset in 
part by a lower fuel burn across the fleet. Fuel and oil costs include the direct cost of fuel, the cost of delivering fuel 
to the aircraft, aircraft de-icing and EU emissions trading costs. The average fuel price paid by Ryanair (calculated 
by dividing total fuel costs by the number of U.S. gallons of fuel consumed) increased 3.0% from EUR2.38 per U.S. 
gallon in the 2013 fiscal year to EUR2.45 per U.S. gallon in the 2014 fiscal year, in each case after giving effect to 
the Company's fuel hedging activities.
 Airport and handling charges and route charges. Ryanair's airport and handling charges per passenger decreased 
2.1% in the 2014 fiscal year, while route charges per passenger increased 4.1%. In absolute terms, airport and 
handling charges increased 0.9%, from EUR611.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year to EUR617.2 million in the 2014 
fiscal year, reflecting the overall growth in passenger volumes, increased charges in Spain, and a quadrupling of 
ATC charges in Italy during the summer, partially offset by the mix of new route and bases launched and the 
weakening of U.K. pound sterling against the euro. In absolute terms, route charges increased 7.3%, from 
EUR486.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, to EUR522.0 million in the 2014 fiscal year, primarily as a result of the 2% 
increase in sectors flown.
 Staff costs. Ryanair's staff costs, which consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits, increased 3.3% on a per-
passenger basis, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 6.4%, from EUR435.6 million in the 2013 fiscal 
year to EUR463.6 million in the 2014 fiscal year. The increase in absolute terms was primarily attributable to a 7.6% 
increase in hours flown and a pay increase of 2.0% granted in fiscal 2014, partially offset by the weakening of U.K. 
pound sterling against the euro.
 Depreciation. Ryanair's depreciation per passenger increased by 3.6%, while in absolute terms these costs 
increased 6.7% from EUR329.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year to EUR351.8 million in the 2014 fiscal year. The 
increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the average number of owned aircraft in the fleet in the 2014 
fiscal year (246) compared to the 2013 fiscal year (242) and spare engines purchased during the year.  See "-
Critical Accounting Policies-Long-lived Assets" above.
 Marketing, distribution and other expenses. Ryanair's marketing, distribution and other operating expenses, 
including those applicable to the generation of ancillary revenues, decreased 5.5% on a per-passenger basis in the 
2014 fiscal year, while in absolute terms, these costs decreased 2.6%, from EUR197.9 million in the 2013 fiscal 
year to EUR192.8 million in the 2014 fiscal year, with the overall decrease primarily reflecting the reduced 
marketing spend per passenger and lower ancillary revenue costs.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs. Ryanair's maintenance, materials and repair expenses, which consist primarily 
of the cost of routine maintenance, provision for leased aircraft and the overhaul of spare parts, decreased 6.7% on 
a per-passenger basis, while in absolute terms these expenses decreased by 3.8% from EUR120.7 million in the 
2013 fiscal year to EUR116.1 million in the 2014 fiscal year. The decrease in absolute terms during the fiscal year 
reflected improved terms on lease extensions, offset in part by costs arising from the increased level of activity.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -39-
 Aircraft rentals. Aircraft rental expenses amounted to EUR101.5 million in the 2014 fiscal year, a 3.4% increase 
from the EUR98.2 million reported in the 2013 fiscal year, reflecting the negative impact of higher lessor financing 
costs and the adverse impact of changes in the euro/dollar exchange rate.
 Operating profit.  As a result of the factors outlined above, operating profit decreased 11.0% on a per-passenger 
basis in the 2014 fiscal year, and also decreased in absolute terms, from EUR718.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year to 
EUR658.6 million in the 2014 fiscal year.
 Finance expense. Ryanair's interest and similar charges decreased 16.2%, from EUR99.3 million in the 2013 fiscal 
year to EUR83.2 million in the 2014 fiscal year, primarily due to lower interest rates and reduced level of debt in the 
2014 fiscal year compared to the 2013 fiscal year. These costs are expected to increase in future periods as 
Ryanair further expands its fleet.
 Finance income. Ryanair's interest and similar income decreased 39.8%, from EUR27.4 million in the 2013 fiscal 
year to EUR16.5 million in the 2014 fiscal year, reflecting lower interest rates and gross cash balances, partially 
offset by increased dividend income from Aer Lingus shares received in the 2014 fiscal year.
 Foreign exchange gains/losses. Ryanair recorded foreign exchange losses of EUR0.5 million in the 2014 fiscal 
year, as compared with foreign exchange gains of EUR4.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, with the different result 
being primarily due to the negative impact of changes in the euro exchange rate against the U.K. pound sterling.
 Taxation. The effective tax rate for the 2014 fiscal year was 11.6%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 12.5% 
in the 2013 fiscal year. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory rate of Irish corporation tax of 12.5%. Ryanair 
recorded an income tax provision of EUR68.6 million in the 2014 fiscal year, compared with a tax provision of 
EUR81.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, with the decrease primarily reflecting lower pre-tax profits. The 
determination regarding the recoverability of the deferred tax asset was based on future income forecasts, which 
demonstrated that it was more likely than not that future profits would be available in order to utilize the deferred tax 
asset. A deferred tax asset's recoverability is not dependent on material improvements over historical levels of pre-
tax income, material changes in the present relationship between income reported for financial and tax purposes, or 
material asset sales or other non-routine transactions.

 Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Ryanair Holdings plc
 Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
 Opinion on financial statements
 1    Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
 We have audited the consolidated and Company financial statements ("financial statements") of Ryanair 
Holdings plc for the year ended March 31, 2014, which comprise the consolidated and Company balance 
sheets, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and Company statements of changes in shareholders' equity, the consolidated and Company 
statements of cash flows and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is Irish law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU), and, as regards the parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2013. Our audit was conducted in accordance with

 2    Our assessment of the risks of material misstatement
 The risks of material misstatement detailed in this section of this report are those risks that we have 
deemed, in our professional judgement, to have had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in our audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. Our audit 
procedures relating to these risks were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements 
as a whole. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of these risks, 
and we do not express an opinion on these individual risks.
 In arriving at our audit opinion above on the Group financial statements the risks of material 
misstatement that had the greatest effect on our Group audit were as follows:
 Carrying value of Property, Plant & Equipment
 Ryanair has property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of EUR5,060.3 million at 31 March 2014 
(2013 EUR4,906.3 million) including aircraft (including engines and related equipment) with a carrying 
value of EUR5,001.1 million (2013 EUR4,854.5 million). In accounting for these assets, Ryanair makes 
estimates about their expected useful lives, expected residual values and the potential for impairment 
based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Changes to the expected useful 
lives and/or the residual values of Ryanair's aircraft fleet could have a material impact on the profit 
for the year. This risk is described in the report from the Audit Committee on page 21.  Ryanair flies one 
aircraft type, the Boeing 737-800, all of which are aged between one and 12 years. There is an active and 
established market for this asset class. The procedures we performed to assess the carrying value of the 
aircraft included:
 --  Comparing Ryanair's estimates of expected useful life and residual value to manufacturers' 
recommendations and to the published estimates of other international airlines.
 --  Assessing the allocation of purchase price to the various components of the aircraft to ensure that 
the value allocated to its service potential compares with actual experience.

 Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit (continued)
 2              Our assessment of the risks of material misstatement (continued)
 Carrying value of Property, Plant & Equipment (continued)
 --  Agreeing the fair value of this aircraft type to generally available independent third party 
valuation reports prepared by specialist aircraft valuation experts to assess the accuracy of the residual 
value estimate.

against historical performance and estimates of the likely economic conditions in its principal markets.
 Maintenance expense
 Ryanair had 51 aircraft held under operating lease at 31 March 2014 (2013: 59 aircraft).  Under the terms 
of operating lease agreements with aircraft lessors, Ryanair is contractually committed to either return 
the aircraft in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the 
airframe, engines and life limited parts upon return.  During the year ended 31 March 2014, Ryanair 
recorded maintenance expense of EUR116.1 million (2013: EUR120.7 million) and carried provisions for 
future maintenance at 31 March 2014 of EUR132.2 million (2013: EUR122.4 million).  The estimated airframe 
and engine maintenance costs and the costs associated with the restitution of life limited parts are 
accrued and charged to profit and loss over the lease term for the individual contractual obligation, 
based on the present value of the major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks and restitution of 
life limited parts by reference to the number of hours flown or cycles operated during the year. This risk 
is further highlighted in the report from the Audit Committee on page 21.
 Our audit procedures in this area involved testing the key assumptions made by Ryanair in estimating 
future maintenance costs including anticipated use of the aircraft and the expected cost of maintenance.  
The procedures included agreeing the actual cost of incurred maintenance to invoices and comparing this 
with Ryanair's estimates, agreeing estimated maintenance costs to maintenance contracts and agreeing the 
expected use of assets to aircraft utilisation in the prior periods and to Ryanair's scheduling plan.

 Having returned over EUR2.5bn to our shareholders over the past 7 years, Ryanair will continue to look for 
opportunities to reward our shareholders for their investment in, and support for, our airline.
 I would like to sincerely thank all the team at Ryanair for their hard work and dedication over the past 12 months.  I 
would especially like to thank our Chairman, David Bonderman, who continues to provide strategic guidance and 
wise counsel.  We are extremely fortunate to have someone of David's stature and experience in the business and 
despite his somewhat dodgy dress sense and musical taste I hope he will continue to chair Ryanair for many years 
to come.
 Finally, may I close by thanking all of Ryanair's 82m customers who have flown with us over the last 12 months. 
We value your business and we are honoured that you chose to fly with Ryanair.  I hope we will continue to 
welcome you and your families on board many more Ryanair flights in the future.
 Yours sincerely,
 Michael O'Leary

Summary year ended March 31, 2014
 Profit after tax decreased by 8% to EUR522.8 million compared to EUR569.3 million in the year ended March 31, 
2013 primarily due to a 5% increase in total operating expenses and a 4% reduction in average fares, offset by 
strong ancillary revenues and increased traffic. Total operating revenues increased by 3% to EUR5,036.7 million, 
primarily due to the 17% growth in ancillary revenues to EUR1,247.2 million and a 3% rise in traffic,  offset by a 4% 
reduction in average fares.
 Total revenue per passenger, as a result, remained flat. Load Factor increased by 1% to 83% compared to the 
year ended March 31, 2013.
 Total operating expenses increased by 5% to EUR4,378.1 million, due to increased fuel prices and the  higher level 
of activity.  Fuel, which represents 46% of total operating costs compared to 45% in the prior year, increased by 7% 
to EUR2,013.1 million due to the higher euro price per gallon paid and increased activity in the year.  Unit costs 
excluding fuel increased by 1% (sector length adjusted unit costs fell by 3%) and including fuel they rose by 2%.  
Operating margin decreased by 2% to 13% whilst operating profit decreased by 8% to EUR658.6 million.
 Net margin was down 2% to 10%, compared to March 31, 2013.
 Basic earnings per share for the year were 36.96 euro cent compared to basic earnings per share of 39.45 euro 
cent at March 31, 2013.

 The Company's net cash inflows from operating activities in the 2013 and 2012 fiscal years amounted to 
EUR1,023.5 million and EUR1,020.3 million, respectively. The EUR3.2 million increase in net cash flows from 
operating activities for fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was principally due to a number of factors including 
a EUR493.8 million increase in operating revenues, due to a combination of a 4.3% increase in average fares, a 
4.5% increase in booked passengers and a 20.1% increase in ancillary revenues, partially offset by a EUR291.0 
million, or 18.3%, increase in fuel and oil costs, due to the increase in the level of activity and increases in the 
average price of fuel, and a EUR146.4 million, or 8.1%, increase in non-fuel related operating expenses (excluding 
a EUR20.4 million, or 6.6%, increase in non-cash depreciation) due to the growth of the business.  In addition, 
movements in working capital, related principally to cash received in advance for flights, and receipt of other 
receivables and increases in other payables balances, generated EUR67.4 million in cash in 2013, compared with 
EUR101.8 million in 2012. This decrease in net cash generated from working capital of EUR34.4 million, or 
approximately 34%, is primarily due to the timing of Easter, which led to lower future fly revenues at year end.
 The Company's net cash inflows from investing activities in fiscal year 2014 totaled EUR300.7 million, primarily 
reflecting, as compared to fiscal year 2013, the Company's decreased investment of cash with maturities of greater 
than three months, as described in more detail below
 The Company's net cash used in investing activities in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 totaled EUR1,821.5 million and 
EUR185.4 million, respectively, primarily reflecting the Company's capital expenditures, and increased investment 
of cash with maturities of greater than three months, as described in more detail below.
 Net cash used in financing activities totaled EUR856.1 million in the 2014 fiscal year, largely reflecting the 
repayments of long-term borrowings of EUR390.8 million and shares purchased under a share buy-back program of 
EUR481.7 million, offset in part by shares issued of EUR16.4 million. Net cash used in financing activities totaled 
EUR669.4 million in fiscal year 2013.  This was due to the receipt of proceeds from long term borrowings of 
EUR234.6 million and shares issued of EUR21.4 million, offset in part by repayments of long-term borrowings of 
EUR366.4 million, the payment of a EUR491.5 million dividend and shares purchased under a share buy-back 
program of EUR67.5 million.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -42-
 The Company experienced a net cash outflow from financing activities of EUR154.9 million in fiscal year 2012. This 
was due to the receipt of proceeds from long term borrowings of EUR292.3 million being more than offset by 
repayments of long-term borrowings of EUR329.7 million and the expenditure of EUR124.6 million under the share 
buy-back program.
 Capital Expenditures. The Company's net cash outflows for capital expenditures in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 
were EUR505.8 million and EUR310.7 million, respectively. Ryanair has funded a significant portion of its 
acquisition of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft and related equipment through borrowings under facilities provided by 
international financial institutions on the basis of guarantees issued by the Export-Import Bank of the United States 
("Ex-Im Bank"). At March 31, 2014, Ryanair had a fleet of 297 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, the majority of which (210 
aircraft) were funded by Ex-Im Bank-guaranteed financing. Other sources of on-balance-sheet aircraft financing 
utilized by Ryanair are Japanese Operating Leases with Call Options ("JOLCOs"), which are treated as finance 
leases (30 of the aircraft in the fleet as of March 31, 2014) and commercial debt financing (6 of the aircraft in the 
fleet as of March 31, 2014). Of Ryanair's total fleet of 297 Boeing 737-800 aircraft at March 31, 2014 there were 51 
aircraft which were financed through operating lease arrangements. Ryanair has generally been able to generate 
sufficient funds from operations to meet its non-aircraft acquisition-related working capital requirements. 
Management believes that the working capital available to the Company is sufficient for its present requirements 
and will be sufficient to meet its anticipated requirements for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for 
the 2015 fiscal year.
 The Company's net cash outflows for capital expenditures in fiscal year 2012 was EUR290.4 million. Of the 25 new 
Boeing 737-800 aircraft which Ryanair took delivery of between April 1, 2011 and March 31, 2012, 11 were 
financed through sale-and-leaseback financings and the remainder through Ex-Im Bank guaranteed-financing.
 The following table sets forth the dates on which and the number of aircraft that will be delivered to the Company 
pursuant to the 2013 Boeing Contract:

Capital Resources. Ryanair's long-term debt (including current maturities) totaled EUR3,083.6 million at March 31, 
2014 and EUR3,498.3 million at March 31, 2013, with the change being primarily attributable to the repayment of 
existing debt facilities. Please see the table "Obligations Due by Period" below for more information on Ryanair's 
long-term debt (including current maturities) and finance leases as of March 31, 2014. See also Note 11 to the 
consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 for further information on the maturity profile of the interest 
rate structure and other information on, the Company's borrowings.
 At March 31, 2014, the majority of the aircraft in Ryanair's fleet had been financed through loan facilities with 
various financial institutions active in the structured export finance sector and supported by a loan guarantee from 
Ex-Im Bank. Each of these facilities takes essentially the same form and is based on the documentation developed 
by Ryanair and Ex-Im Bank, which follows standard market forms for this type of financing. In November 2010, 
Ryanair financed seven aircraft through a U.S. dollar-denominated Ex-Im Bank Capital Markets Product 
("Eximbond"). The Eximbond has essentially the same characteristics as all previous Ex-Im Bank guaranteed 
financings with no additional obligations on Ryanair. On the basis of an Ex-Im Bank guarantee with regard to the 
financing of up to 85% of the eligible U.S. and foreign content represented in the net purchase price of the relevant 
aircraft, the financial institution investor enters into a commitment letter with the Company to provide financing for a 
specified number of aircraft benefiting from such guarantee; loans are then drawn down as the aircraft are delivered 
and payments to Boeing become due. Each of the loans under the facilities are on substantially similar terms, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -42-
having a maturity of 12 years from the drawdown date and being secured by a first priority mortgage in favor of a 
security trustee on behalf of Ex-Im Bank.
 Through the use of interest rate swaps or cross currency interest rate swaps, Ryanair has effectively converted a 
portion of its floating-rate debt under its financing facilities into fixed-rate debt. Approximately 34% of the loans for 
the aircraft acquired under the above facilities are not covered by such swaps and have therefore remained at 
floating rates linked to EURIBOR, with the interest rate exposure from these loans largely hedged by placing a 
similar amount of cash on deposit at floating interest rates. The net result is that Ryanair has effectively swapped or 
drawn down fixed-rate euro-denominated debt with maturities between seven and twelve years in respect of 
approximately 66% of its outstanding debt financing at March 31, 2014 and of this total approximately 48% of this 
debt has been partially swapped, with the relevant swaps covering the first seven years of the twelve-year 
amortizing period.
 The table below illustrates the effect of swap transactions (each of which is with an established international 
financial counterparty) on the profile of Ryanair's total outstanding debt at March 31, 2014. See "Item 11. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Interest Rate Exposure and Hedging" for additional

 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements
 1              Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the 2014 
fiscal year are set out below. These have been applied consistently for all periods presented, except as 
otherwise stated.
 Business activity
 Ryanair Limited and its subsidiaries ("Ryanair Limited") has operated as an international airline since 
commencing operations in 1985. On August 23, 1996, Ryanair Holdings Limited, a newly formed holding 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -65-
company, acquired the entire issued share capital of Ryanair Limited. On May 16, 1997, Ryanair Holdings 
Limited re-registered as a public limited company, Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company"). Ryanair Holdings 
plc and its subsidiaries are hereafter together referred to as "Ryanair Holdings plc" (or "we", "our", 
"us", "Ryanair" or the "Company") and currently operate a low-fares airline headquartered in Dublin, 
Ireland. All trading activity continues to be undertaken by the group of companies headed by Ryanair 
Limited.
 Statement of compliance
 In accordance with the International Accounting Standards ("IAS") Regulation (EC 1606 (2002)) which 
applies throughout the European Union ("EU"), the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards  
("IFRS") as adopted by the EU ("IFRS as adopted by the EU"), which are effective for the year ended and as 
at March 31, 2014.  In addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRS as adopted by 
the EU, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") ("IFRS as issued by the IASB"). The consolidated 
financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2013.
 Details of legislative changes and new accounting standards or amendments to accounting standards, which 
are not yet effective and have not been early adopted in these consolidated financial statements, and the 
likely impact on future financial statements are set forth below in the prospective accounting changes 
section.
 New accounting standards adopted during the year
 The following new and amended standards, that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB), and are effective under those standards for the first time for the financial year beginning 
on or after January 1, 2013, and have also been endorsed by the EU, have been applied by the Group for the 
first time in the consolidated financial statements;
 --     IAS 1 (amendment 2011), "Presentation of Items of financial statements".
 --      IAS 19 (amendment 2011), "Employee benefits".
 --      IFRS 7 (amendment), "Disclosures - Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"
 --      IFRS 13, "Fair Value Measurement".
 --      "Improvements to IFRSs". 2009-2011 Cycle.
 --      IAS 27 (amended 2011), "Separate financial statements".
 --      IAS 28 (amended 2011), "Associates and joint ventures".
 --      IFRS 10, "Consolidated Financial Statements".
 --      IFRS 11, "Joint arrangements".
 --      IFRS 12, "Disclosure of interests in other entities".
 In addition the following amendment has been early adopted:
 --      IAS 36 (amendment), "Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on our financial position, 
results from operations, or disclosures in the year ended March 31, 2014.
 Basis of preparation
 These consolidated financial statements are presented in euro millions, the euro being the functional 
currency of the parent entity and the majority of the group companies. They are prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale securities which are stated 
at fair value, and share-based payments, which are based on fair value determined as at the grant date of 
the relevant share options. Certain non-current assets, when they are classified as held for sale, are 
stated at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell.

Body
 Fuel and oil. Ryanair's fuel and oil costs per passenger increased by 13.2%, while in absolute terms, these costs 
increased by 18.3% from EUR1,593.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR1,884.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, in 
each case after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities. The 18.3% increase reflected a 15% increase 
in average fuel prices paid and the impact of a 3.7% increase in the number of hours flown, which were offset in 
part by a 2.2% decrease in the average sector length. Fuel and oil costs include the direct cost of fuel, the cost of 
delivering fuel to the aircraft, aircraft de-icing and EU emissions trading costs. The average fuel price paid by 
Ryanair (calculated by dividing total fuel costs by the number of U.S. gallons of fuel consumed) increased 14.4% 
from EUR2.08 per U.S. gallon in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR2.38 per U.S. gallon in the 2013 fiscal year, in each 
case after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities.
 Airport and handling charges and route charges. Ryanair's airport and handling charges per passenger increased 
5.6%, while route charges per passenger increased 1.1% in the 2013 fiscal year. In absolute terms, airport and 
handling charges increased 10.4%, from EUR554.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, to EUR611.6 million in the 2013 
fiscal year, reflecting the overall growth in passenger volumes and higher charges at Dublin and London (Stansted) 
airports, partially offset by lower average costs at Ryanair's newer airports and bases. In absolute terms, route 
charges increased 5.7%, from EUR460.5 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR486.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, 
primarily as a result of the 4.7% increase in sectors flown.
 Staff costs. Ryanair's staff costs, which consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits, increased 0.4% on a per-
passenger basis, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 5.0%, from EUR415.0 million in the 2013 fiscal 
year to EUR435.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year. The increase in absolute terms was primarily attributable to a 3.7% 
increase in hours flown and a flight crew pay increase of 2% granted in fiscal 2013.
 Depreciation. Ryanair's depreciation per passenger increased by 2.0%, while in absolute terms these costs 
increased 6.6% from EUR309.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR329.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year. The 
increase was primarily attributable to the addition of 11 owned aircraft to the fleet during the 2013 fiscal year. See "-
Critical Accounting Policies-Long-lived Assets" above.
 Marketing, distribution and other expenses. Ryanair's marketing, distribution and other operating expenses, 
including those applicable to the generation of ancillary revenues, increased 5.2% on a per-passenger basis in the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -41-
2013 fiscal year, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 9.9%, from EUR180.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year 
to EUR197.9 million in the 2013 fiscal year, with the overall increase primarily reflecting the higher level of activity 
and increased onboard product costs reflecting the higher level of sales.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs. Ryanair's maintenance, materials and repair expenses, which consist primarily 
of the cost of routine maintenance, provision for leased aircraft and the overhaul of spare parts, increased 11.0% on 
a per-passenger basis, while in absolute terms these expenses increased by 16.0% from EUR104.0 million in the 
2012 fiscal year to EUR120.7 million in the 2013 fiscal year. The increase in absolute terms during the fiscal year 
reflected the additional costs arising from increased level of activity and the opening of new bases.
 Aircraft rentals. Aircraft rental expenses amounted to EUR98.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year, an 8.2% increase 
from the EUR90.7 million reported in the 2012 fiscal year, reflecting the negative impact of higher lessor financing 
costs and the adverse impact of changes in the euro/dollar exchange rate on new leased aircraft and the handback 
of 4 aircraft due to the maturity of leases.
 Operating profit.  As a result of the factors outlined above, operating profit increased 0.6% on a per-passenger 
basis in the 2013 fiscal year, and also increased in absolute terms, from EUR683.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year to 
EUR718.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year.
 Finance expense. Ryanair's interest and similar charges decreased 9.0%, from EUR109.2 million in the 2012 fiscal 
year to EUR99.3 million in the 2013 fiscal year, primarily due to lower interest rates in the 2013 fiscal year 
compared to the 2012 fiscal year. These costs are expected to increase as Ryanair further expands its fleet.
 Finance income. Ryanair's interest and similar income decreased 38.2%, from EUR44.3 million in the 2012 fiscal 
year to EUR27.4 million in the 2013 fiscal year, reflecting the reduced yields on term deposits.
 Foreign exchange gains/losses. Ryanair recorded foreign exchange gains of EUR4.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, 
as compared with foreign exchange gains of EUR4.3 million in the 2012 fiscal year, with the different result being 
primarily due to the positive impact of changes in the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar exchange rates 
against the euro.
 Taxation. The effective tax rate for the 2013 fiscal year was 12.5%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 11.5% 
in the 2012 fiscal year. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory rate of Irish corporation tax of 12.5%. Ryanair 
recorded an income tax provision of EUR81.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, compared with a tax provision of 
EUR72.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year, with the increase primarily reflecting higher pre-tax profits. The 
determination regarding the recoverability of the deferred tax asset was based on future income forecasts, which 
demonstrated that it was more likely than not that future profits would be available in order to utilize the deferred tax 
asset. A deferred tax asset's recoverability is not dependent on material improvements over historical levels of pre-
tax income, material changes in the present relationship between income reported for financial and tax purposes, or 
material asset sales or other non-routine transactions.
 SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS
 The Company's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management expects 
these variations to continue. Among the factors causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to 
general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Ryanair typically records higher revenues and 
income in the first half of each fiscal year ended March 31 than the second half of such year.
 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 Please see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 for information on recently issued 
accounting standards that are material to the Company.
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 Liquidity. The Company finances its working capital requirements through a combination of cash generated from 
operations, debt capital market issuances and bank loans for the acquisition of aircraft. See "Item 3. Key 
Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-The Company Will Incur Significant Costs Acquiring New 
Aircraft and Any Instability in the Credit and Capital Markets could Negatively Impact Ryanair's Ability to Obtain 
Financing on Acceptable Terms" for more information about risks relating to liquidity and capital resources. The 
Company had cash and liquid resources at March 31, 2014 and 2013 of EUR3,241.7 million and EUR3,559.0 
million, respectively. The decrease at March 31, 2014 primarily reflects cash generated from operating activities of 
EUR1,044.6 million, which was offset by the cash used to fund the purchase of 69.5 million Ordinary Shares via a 
share buy-back costing EUR481.7 million, as well as the purchase of property, plant, and equipment - primarily pre-
delivery payments on new Boeing 737-800 aircraft, spare engines and the repayment of EUR390.8 million of 
borrowings. Cash and liquid resources included EUR13.3 million and EUR24.7 million in "restricted cash" held on 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -41-
deposit as collateral for certain derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company with respect to its 
aircraft financing obligations and other banking arrangements at March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See "Item 
8. Financial Information 3/4 Other Financial Information 3/4 Legal Proceedings."
 The Company's net cash inflows from operating activities in the 2014 and 2013 fiscal years amounted to 
EUR1,044.6 million and EUR1,023.5 million, respectively. The EUR21.1 million increase in net cash flows from 
operating activities for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was principally due to a number of factors 
including an increase in accrued expenses. This movement,  which primarily relates to cash received in advance for 
flights, and receipt of other receivables and increases in other payables balances, generated EUR133.9 million in 
cash in 2014, compared with EUR67.4 million in 2013. This increase in net cash generated from working capital of 
EUR66.5 million, or approximately 98.7%, is primarily due to the an increase in cash receipts from advance 
bookings, some of which is due to the timing of Easter which fell in April 2014.
 During the last two fiscal years, Ryanair's primary cash requirements have been for operating expenses, additional 
aircraft, including advance payments in respect of new Boeing 737-800s and related flight equipment, payments on 
related indebtedness and payments of corporation tax, as well as share buy-backs of EUR549.2 million and the 
payment of a EUR491.5 million special dividend to shareholders. Cash generated from operations has been the 
principal source for these cash requirements, supplemented primarily by aircraft-related bank loans.

 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information
 Except for the historical statements and discussions contained herein, statements contained in this 
report constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities 
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Forward-looking statements may include words such as "expect," 
"estimate," "project," "anticipate," "should," "intend," and similar expressions or variations on such 
expressions. Any filing made by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") 
may include forward-looking statements. In addition, other written or oral statements which constitute 
forward-looking statements have been made and may in the future be made by or on behalf of the Company, 
including statements concerning its future operating and financial performance, the Company's share of new 
and existing markets, general industry and economic trends and the Company's performance relative thereto 
and the Company's expectations as to requirements for capital expenditures and regulatory matters. The 
Company's business is to provide a low-fares airline service in Europe, and its outlook is predominately 
based on its interpretation of what it considers to be the key economic factors affecting that business 
and the European economy. Forward-looking statements with regard to the Company's business rely on a 
number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other 
factors, many of which are outside the Company's control, that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from such statements. It is not reasonably possible to itemize all of the many factors and 
specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European economy. 
Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results are 
the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for 
replacement aircraft and aircraft maintenance services, aircraft availability, costs associated with 
environmental, safety and security measures, terrorist attacks, actions of the Irish, U.K., EU and other 
governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest 
rates, changes to the structure of the euro, airport handling and access charges, litigation, labor 
relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, 
the U.K. and elsewhere in Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel, flight interruptions 
caused by volcanic ash emissions or other atmospheric disruptions, factors affecting the value of 
Ryanair's investment in Aer Lingus Group plc and other factors discussed herein. The Company disclaims any 
obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, 
future events or otherwise.

FISCAL YEAR 2014 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2013
 Profit after taxation. Ryanair recorded a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR522.8 million in the 2014 
fiscal year, as compared with a profit of EUR569.3 million in the 2013 fiscal year. This 8.2% decrease was primarily 
attributable to an increase in total operating expenses of 5.1%, and a 3.7% reduction in average fares, offset, in 
part, by strong ancillary revenues and increased traffic.
 Scheduled revenues. Ryanair's scheduled passenger revenues decreased 0.8%, from EUR3,819.8 million in the 
2013 fiscal year, to EUR3,789.5 million in the 2014 fiscal year, primarily reflecting a decrease of 3.7% in average 
fares. The number of passengers booked increased 3.0%, from 79.3 million to 81.7 million, reflecting increased 
passenger volumes on existing routes and the successful launch of new bases at Athens, Thessaloniki, Brussels 
(Zaventem) , Lisbon, Rome (Fiumicino), Catania, Lamezia and Palermo in the 2014 fiscal year.  Booked passenger 
load factors increased to 83% in fiscal 2014 compared with 82% in fiscal 2013.
 Passenger capacity during the 2014 fiscal year increased by 2.4% due to an increase in the average number of 
aircraft in the fleet. Scheduled passenger revenues accounted for 75.2 % of Ryanair's total revenues for the 2014 
fiscal year, compared with 78.2% of total revenues in the 2013 fiscal year.
 Ancillary revenues. Ryanair's ancillary revenues, which comprise revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, 
in-flight sales and Internet-related services, increased 17.2%, from EUR1,064.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year to 
EUR1,247.2 million in the 2014 fiscal year, while ancillary revenues per booked passenger increased to EUR15.27 
from EUR13.43. Revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, including revenues from excess baggage 
charges, administration/credit card fees, sales of rail and bus tickets, priority boarding, reserved seating, 
accommodation, travel insurance and car rental increased 21.6% to EUR1,012.4 million from EUR832.9 million in 
the 2013 fiscal year. Revenues from in-flight sales increased 6.8%, to EUR117.3 million from EUR109.8 million in 
the 2013 fiscal year. Revenues from Internet-related services, primarily commissions received from products sold 
on Ryanair.com or linked websites, decreased 3.3%, from EUR121.5 million in the 2013 fiscal year to EUR117.5 
million in the 2014 fiscal year, reflecting a combination of factors including an improved product mix and the 
implementation of a reserved seating system across the network. The rate of increase in ancillary revenues 
exceeded that of the increase in overall passengers booked.
 The following table sets forth the components of ancillary revenues earned by Ryanair and each component 
expressed as a percentage of total ancillary revenues for each of the periods indicated:

Operating expenses. As a percentage of total revenues, Ryanair's operating expenses increased from 85.3% in the 
2013 fiscal year to 86.9% in the 2014 fiscal year. Total revenues increased by 3.1%, slower than the 5.1% increase 
in operating expenses. In absolute terms, total operating expenses increased 5.1%, from EUR4,165.8 million in the 
2013 fiscal year to EUR4,378.1 million in the 2014 fiscal year, principally as a result of a 6.8% increase in fuel and 
oil costs from EUR1,885.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year to EUR2,013.1 million in the 2014 fiscal year, partially 
offset by the weakening of the U.K. pound sterling to the euro. Airport and handling charges, maintenance, 
materials and repairs and marketing, distribution and other costs decreased as a percentage of total revenues, 
while staff costs, depreciation, route charges and fuel and oil expenses increased and aircraft rental expenses 
stayed constant. Total operating expenses per passenger increased by 2.0%, with the increase reflecting, 
principally, the increase in passenger capacity during the 2014 fiscal year and the impact of the higher fuel costs.
 The Company's decision to ground aircraft did not have a material impact on the results of the Company for the 
year ended March 31, 2014  and, at present, is not anticipated to have a material impact on future operations. The 
Company anticipates that any revenues which could have been generated had the Company operated the 
grounded aircraft would have been lower than the operating costs associated with operating these aircraft, due to 
significantly higher fuel costs, airport charges and taxes. The Company does not anticipate that any material staff 
costs will be incurred during future periods of the grounding of aircraft, as the relevant staff can be furloughed under 
the terms of their contracts without compensation and the maintenance costs associated with the grounded aircraft 
will be minimal. However, the Company will still incur aircraft ownership costs comprised of depreciation and 
amortization costs, lease rentals costs and financing costs.

 Using the debt capital markets to finance the Company and the 2013 Boeing Contract requires the Company to 
obtain and retain investment grade credit ratings, (the Company has a BBB+ (stable) credit rating from S&P and a 
BBB+ (stable) credit rating from Fitch). There is a risk that the Company will be unable, or unwilling, to access these 
markets if it is downgraded or is unable to retain its investment grade credit ratings and this could lead to a higher 
cost of finance for Ryanair.
 Ryanair has also entered into significant derivative transactions intended to hedge its current aircraft acquisition-
related debt obligations. These derivative transactions expose Ryanair to certain risks and could have adverse 
effects on its results of operations and financial condition. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
About Market Risk."
 The Company's Growth May Expose It to Risks. Ryanair's operations have grown rapidly since it pioneered the 
low-fares operating model in Europe in the early 1990s.  Ryanair intends to continue to expand its fleet and add 
new destinations and additional flights, with the goal of increasing Ryanair's booked passenger volumes to 
approximately 112.0 million passengers per annum by March 31, 2019, an increase of approximately 37% from the 
approximately 81.7 million passengers booked in the 2014 fiscal year. However, no assurance can be given that 
this target will be met. If growth in passenger traffic and Ryanair's revenues do not keep pace with the planned 
expansion of its fleet, Ryanair could suffer from overcapacity and its results of operations and financial condition 
(including its ability to fund scheduled purchases of the New Aircraft and related debt repayments) could be 
materially adversely affected.
 The continued expansion of Ryanair's fleet and operations, at a rate lower than in previous years (although in 
absolute terms it may be higher), in addition to other factors, may also strain existing management resources and 
related operational, financial, management information and information technology systems. Expansion will 
generally require additional skilled personnel, equipment, facilities and systems. An inability to hire skilled personnel 
or to secure required equipment and facilities efficiently and in a cost-effective manner may adversely affect 
Ryanair's ability to achieve its growth plans and sustain or increase its profitability.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -19-
 Ryanair's New Routes and Expanded Operations May Have an Adverse Financial Impact on its Results. Currently, 
a substantial number of carriers operate routes that compete with Ryanair, and the Company expects to face further 
intense competition.
 When Ryanair commences new routes, its load factors and fares tend to be lower than those on its established 
routes and its advertising and other promotional costs tend to be higher, which may result in initial losses that could 
have a material negative impact on Ryanair's results of operations as well as require a substantial amount of cash 
to fund. In addition, there can be no assurance that Ryanair's low-fares service will be accepted on new routes. 
Ryanair also periodically runs special promotional fare campaigns, in particular in connection with the opening of 
new routes. Promotional fares may have the effect of increasing load factors and reducing Ryanair's yield and 
passenger revenues on such routes during the periods that they are in effect. Ryanair has other significant cash 
needs as it expands, including as regards the cash required to fund aircraft purchases or aircraft deposits related to 
the acquisition of additional Boeing 737-800 series aircraft. There can be no assurance that Ryanair will have 
sufficient cash to make such expenditures and investments, and to the extent Ryanair is unable to expand its route 
system successfully, its future revenue and earnings growth will in turn be limited. See "-The Company Will Incur 
Significant Costs Acquiring New Aircraft and Any Instability in the Credit and Capital Markets Could Negatively 
Impact Ryanair's Ability to Obtain Financing on Acceptable Terms."
 Ryanair's Continued Growth is Dependent on Access to Suitable Airports; Charges for Airport Access are Subject 
to Increase. Airline traffic at certain European airports is regulated by a system of grandfathered "slot" allocations. 
Each slot represents authorization to take-off and land at the particular airport during a specified time period. 
Although the majority of Ryanair's bases currently have no slot allocations, traffic at a minority of the airports 
Ryanair serves, including some of its primary bases, is currently regulated through slot allocations. In addition, 
many of the primary airports that Ryanair intends to serve as part of its recent strategic initiatives are subject to slot 
allocations. There can be no assurance that Ryanair will be able to obtain a sufficient number of slots at slot-
controlled airports that it may wish to serve in the future, at the time it needs them, or on acceptable terms. There 
can also be no assurance that its non-slot constrained bases, or the other non-slot constrained airports Ryanair 
serves, will continue to operate without slot allocation restrictions in the future. See "Item 4. Information on the 
Company-Government Regulation-Slots." Airports may impose other operating restrictions such as curfews, limits 
on aircraft noise levels, mandatory flight paths, runway restrictions, and limits on the number of average daily 
departures. Such restrictions may limit the ability of Ryanair to provide service to, or increase service at, such 
airports.
 Ryanair's future growth also materially depends on its ability to access suitable airports located in its targeted 
geographic markets at costs that are consistent with Ryanair's strategy. Any condition that denies, limits, or delays 
Ryanair's access to airports it serves or seeks to serve in the future would constrain Ryanair's ability to grow. A 
change in the terms of Ryanair's access to these facilities or any increase in the relevant charges paid by Ryanair 
as a result of the expiration or termination of such arrangements and Ryanair's failure to renegotiate comparable 
terms or rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
For example in Spain, the Spanish government increased airport taxes at the two largest airports, Barcelona and 
Madrid, by over 100%, while smaller increases were implemented at other Spanish airports effective from July 1, 
2012. As a result, Ryanair cancelled routes and reduced capacity on remaining routes from Madrid and Barcelona 
in response to the Spanish government's decision to double airport taxes at the two airports.  For additional 
information, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-Airport Operations-Airport Charges." See also "-The 
Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports."
 The Company's Acquisition of 29.8% of Aer Lingus and Subsequent Failure to Conclude a Complete Acquisition of 
Aer Lingus Could Expose the Company to Risk. During the 2007 fiscal year, the Company acquired 25.2% of Aer 
Lingus. The Company increased its interest to 29.3% during the 2008 fiscal year, and to 29.8% during the 2009 
fiscal year at a total aggregate cost of EUR407.2 million. Following the acquisition of its initial stake and upon the 
approval of the Company's shareholders, management proposed to effect a tender offer to acquire the entire share 
capital of Aer Lingus. This 2006 offer was, however, prohibited by the European Commission on competition 
grounds.
 In October 2007, the European Commission reached a formal decision that it would not force Ryanair to sell its 
shares in Aer Lingus. This decision has been affirmed on appeal. However, EU legislation may change in the future 
to require such a forced disposition. If eventually forced to dispose of its stake in Aer Lingus, Ryanair could suffer 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -19-
significant losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer 
Lingus' shares.
 The United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") wrote to Ryanair in September 2010, advising that it intended 
to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair objected on the basis that the OFT's investigation was 
time-barred. On June 15, 2012, the OFT referred the investigation of Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus to the 
U.K. Competition Commission (the "Competition Commission").
 On June 19, 2012, Ryanair announced its third all cash offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it 
did not own at a price of EUR1.30 per ordinary share and immediately commenced pre-notification discussions with 
the European Commission for the purpose of preparing a merger filing.  Ryanair contended that, pending the 
outcome of the European Commission's review of Ryanair's bid, on the basis of the duty of "sincere cooperation" 
between the EU and the Member States, and under the EU Merger Regulation, the UK Competition Commission's 
investigation of Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus should not have properly proceeded.  Nevertheless, Aer 
Lingus argued that the investigation should proceed and that Ryanair's offer was in breach of certain provisions of 
the UK Enterprise Act 2002.

Body
 The Board has carried out its annual evaluation of the independence of each of its non-executive directors, taking 
account of the relevant provisions of the 2012 Code, namely, whether the directors are independent in character 
and judgement and free from relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the 
directors' judgment. The Board regards all of the directors as independent and that no one individual or one 
grouping exerts an undue influence on others.
 The Board has considered Kyran McLaughlin's independence given his role as Deputy Chairman and Head of 
Capital Markets at Davy Stockbrokers. Davy Stockbrokers are one of Ryanair's corporate brokers and provide 
corporate advisory services to Ryanair from time to time. The Board has considered the fees paid to Davy 
Stockbrokers for these services and believe that they are immaterial to both Ryanair and Davy Stockbrokers given 
the size of each organisation's business operations and financial results. Having considered this relationship, the 
Board has concluded that Kyran McLaughlin continues to be an independent non-executive director within the spirit 
and meaning of the 2012 Code Rules.
 The Board has also considered the independence of David Bonderman given his shareholding in Ryanair Holdings 
plc. As at March 31, 2014, David Bonderman had a beneficial shareholding in the Company of 7,655,671 ordinary 
shares, equivalent to 0.55% of the issued share capital. Having considered this shareholding in light of the number 
of issued shares in Ryanair Holdings plc and the financial interest of the director, the Board has concluded that the 
interest is not so material as to breach the spirit of the independence rule contained in the 2012 Code.
 The Board has further considered the independence of Messrs. David Bonderman, James Osborne,  Kyran 
McLaughlin and Michael Horgan as they have each served more than nine years on the Board. The Board 
considers that each of these directors is independent in character and judgment as each has other significant 
commercial and professional commitments and each brings his own level of senior experience gained in their fields 
of international business and professional practice. When arriving at this decision, the Board has taken into account 
the comments made by the FRC in their report dated December, 2009 on their review of the impact and 
effectiveness of the Code, in particular their comment that independence is not the primary consideration when 
assessing the composition of the Board, and that the over-riding consideration should be that the Board is fit for 
purpose. For these reasons, and also because each director's independence is considered annually by the Board, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -6-
the Board considers it appropriate that these directors have not been offered for annual re-election as is 
recommended by the 2012 Code.  The Nominations Committee have confirmed to the Board that they consider the 
directors offering themselves for re-election at the 2014 AGM to be independent and that they continue to 
effectively contribute to the work of the Board. The Nominations Committee recommends that the Company accept 
the re-election of the directors.
 Board Procedures
 All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and the Board has established a 
procedure whereby directors wishing to obtain advice in the furtherance of their duties may take independent 
professional advice at the Company's expense.
 Directors meet with key executives with a particular focus on ensuring non-executive directors are fully informed on 
issues of relevance to Ryanair and its operations. Extensive papers on key business issues are provided to all 
directors in connection with the Board meetings. All directors are encouraged to update and refresh their skills and 
knowledge, for example, through attending courses on technical areas or external briefings for non-executive 
directors.
 The Company has Directors & Officers liability insurance in place in respect of any legal actions taken against the 
directors in the course of the exercise of their duties. New non-executive directors are encouraged to meet the 
executive director and senior management for briefing on the Company's developments and plans.
 Meetings
 The Board meets at least on a quarterly basis and in the year to March 31, 2014 the Board convened meetings on 
nine occasions. Individual attendance at these meetings is set out in the table on page 24. Detailed Board papers 
are circulated in advance so that Board members have adequate time and information to be able to participate fully 
at the meeting.
 The holding of detailed regular Board meetings and the fact that many matters require Board approval, show that 
the running of the Company is firmly in the hands of the Board. The non-executive directors meet periodically 
without executives being present. Led by the senior independent director, the non-executive directors will meet 
without the Chairman present at least annually to appraise the Chairman's performance and on such other 
occasions as are deemed appropriate.
 Remuneration
 Details of remuneration paid to the directors are set out in Note 19 to the consolidated Financial Statements on 
pages 189 to 191. Also, please see the Report of the Remuneration Committee on Directors' Remuneration on 
page 29.
 Non-executive directors
 Non-executive directors are remunerated by way of directors' fees.  A number of non-executive directors have 
share options. While the 2012 Code notes that the remuneration of the non-executive director should not include 
share options, the Board believes that the quantum of options granted to non-executive directors is not so 
significant as to raise any issue concerning their independence. Michael Horgan is remunerated on a consultancy 
basis on safety issues and also by way of share options.
 Full details are disclosed in Note 19(b) and 19(d) on pages 190 to 191 of the consolidated financial statements.
 Executive director remuneration
 The Chief Executive of the Company is the only executive director on the Board. In addition to his base salary he is 
eligible for a performance bonus of up to 100% of salary and other bonuses dependent upon the achievement of 
certain financial targets and a pension. It is considered that the significant shareholding of the Chief Executive acts 
to align his interests with those of shareholders and gives him a keen incentive to perform to the highest levels.
 Full details of the executive director's remuneration are set out in Note 19(a) on page 190 of the consolidated 
financial statements.
 Share Ownership and Dealing
 Details of the directors' interests in Ryanair shares are set out in Note 19(d) on page 191 of the consolidated 
financial statements.
 The Board has adopted The Model Code, as set out in the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange and the UK 
Listing Authority, as the code of dealings applicable to dealings in Ryanair shares by directors and relevant 
Company employees. The code of dealing also includes provisions which are intended to ensure compliance with 
US securities laws and regulations of the NASDAQ National market. Under the policy, directors are required to 
obtain clearance from the Chairman or Chief Executive before dealing in Ryanair shares, whilst relevant Company 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -6-
employees must obtain clearance from designated senior management and are prohibited from dealing in the 
shares during prohibited periods as defined by the Listing Rules and at any time at which the individual is in 
possession of inside information (as defined in the Market Abuse (Directive 2003/6/EC) Regulations 2005).
 Board Succession and Structure
 The Board plans for its own succession with guidance from the Nomination Committee. The Nomination Committee 
regularly review the structure, size and composition (including the skills, knowledge and experience) required of the 
Board compared to its current position with regard to the strategic needs of Ryanair and recommends changes to 
the Board. There is a formal, thorough and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors to the Board. 
The Nominations Committee identifies and selects candidates on merit against objective criteria, to ensure that the 
Board have the skills, knowledge and expertise required.
 The Board currently comprises of ten directors, Chief Executive Officer, Michael O' Leary, is the only executive 
director. The nine non-executive directors include Chairman David Bonderman. Biographies of all current directors 
are set out on pages 106 of this report. Ryanair considers that the Board has the correct balance and depth of 
skills, knowledge, expertise and experience to optimally lead the Company and that all directors give adequate time 
to the performance of their duties and responsibilities.
 Ryanair considers that all directors discharge their directorial duties with the objectivity and impartiality they have 
demonstrated since commencing their respective roles and has determined that each of the non-executive directors 
is independent. In reaching that conclusion, Ryanair considered the character, judgement, objectivity and integrity 
of each director and had due regard for the 2012 Code.  Ryanair continually endeavors to maintain the quality and 
independence of its Board.
 Board Committees
 The Board of Directors has established a number of committees, including the following:
 Executive Committee
 The Board of Directors established the Executive Committee in August 1996. The Executive Committee can 
exercise the powers exercisable by the full Board of Directors in circumstances in which action by the Board of 
Directors is required but it is impracticable to convene a meeting of the full Board of Directors. Messrs. David 
Bonderman, Michael O'Leary, Kyran McLaughlin and James Osborne are the members of the Executive 
Committee.
 Audit Committee
 The Board of Directors established the Audit Committee in September 1996.

 GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 Liberalization of the EU Air Transportation Market
 Ryanair began its flight operations in 1985, during a decade in which the governments of Ireland and the 
U.K. liberalized the bilateral arrangements for the operation of air services between the two countries. 
In 1992, the Council of Ministers of the EU adopted a package of measures intended to liberalize the 
internal market for air transportation in the EU. The liberalization included measures that allow EU air 
carriers substantial freedom to set air fares, provided EU air carriers greatly enhanced access to routes 
within the EU, and also introduced a licensing procedure for EU air carriers. Beginning in April 1997, EU 
air carriers have generally been able to provide passenger services on domestic routes within any EU 
member state outside their home country of operations without restriction.
 Regulatory Authorities
 Ryanair is subject to Irish and EU regulation, which is implemented primarily by the Department of 
Transport, Tourism and Sport ("DTTAS"), the Irish Aviation Authority ("IAA"), the European Commission, and 
the European Aviation Safety Agency ("EASA"). Management believes that the present regulatory environment 
in Ireland and the EU is characterized by high sensitivity to safety and security issues, which is 
demonstrated by intensive reviews of safety-related procedures, training, and equipment by the national 
and EU regulatory authorities.
 Commission for Aviation Regulation "CAR". The CAR is currently primarily responsible for deciding maximum 
airport charges only at Dublin Airport. See " 3/4 Airport Operations 3/4 Airport Charges" above.
 The CAR also has responsibility for licensing Irish airlines, subject to the requirements of EU law. It 
issues operating licenses under the provisions of EU Regulation 1008/2008 (formerly 2407/92). An operating 
license is an authorization permitting the holder to transport passengers, mail and/or cargo by air. The 
criteria for granting an operating license include, inter alia, an air carrier's financial fitness, the 
adequacy of its insurance, and the fitness of the persons who will manage the air carrier. In addition, in 
order to obtain and maintain an operating license, Irish and EU regulations require that (i) the air 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -32-
carrier must be owned and continue to be owned directly or through majority ownership by EU member states 
and/or nationals of EU member states and (ii) the air carrier must at all times be effectively controlled 
by such EU member states or EU nationals. The CAR has broad authority to revoke an operating license. See 
"Item 10. Additional Information--Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals." See also "Item 3. 
Risk Factors--Risks Related to Ownership of the Company's Ordinary Shares or ADRs-EU Rules Impose 
Restrictions on the Ownership of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares by Non-EU nationals and the Company has 
Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals" above.
 Ryanair's current operating license became effective on December 1, 1993, and is subject to periodic 
review. The Flight Operations Department is also subject to ongoing review by the IAA, which reviews the 
department's audits, including flight audits, training audits, document audits, and quality audits. 
Ryanair's current Air Operator Certificate No IE 7/94 was issued on January 28, 2014.
 Irish Aviation Authority. The IAA is primarily responsible for the operational and regulatory function 
and services relating to the safety, security and technical aspects of aviation in Ireland. To operate in 
Ireland and the EU, an Irish air carrier is required to hold an air operator's certificate granted by the 
IAA attesting to the air carrier's operational and technical competence to conduct airline services with 
specified types of aircraft. The IAA has broad authority to amend or revoke an air operator's certificate, 
with Ryanair's ability to continue to hold its air operator's certificate being subject to ongoing 
compliance with applicable statutes, rules and regulations pertaining to the airline industry, including 
any new rules and regulations that may be adopted in the future.
 The IAA is also responsible for overseeing and regulating the operations of Irish air carriers. Matters 
within the scope of the IAA's regulatory authority include: air safety; aircraft certification; personnel 
licensing and training; maintenance, manufacture, repair, airworthiness, and operation of aircraft; 
implementation of EU legislation; aircraft noise; aviation security and ground services. Each of the 
Company's aircraft is required to have a Certificate of Airworthiness, which is issued by the IAA. The 
validity of Certificates of Airworthiness is subject to the review by the IAA. Each certificate is 
generally valid for a 12-month period. In March 2009, Ryanair received "Sub-Part (I) approval" from the 
IAA, which gives Ryanair the authority to extend the validity of its certificates, subject to certain 
record checks and physical aircraft inspections being performed by Ryanair's quality department. The 
Company's flight personnel, flight and emergency procedures, aircraft, and maintenance facilities are 
subject to periodic inspections by the IAA. The IAA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including 
the authority to require reports; inspect the books, records, premises, and aircraft of a carrier; and 
investigate and institute enforcement proceedings. Failure to comply with IAA regulations can result in 
revocation of operating certification.
 In July 1999, the IAA awarded Ryanair an air operator's certificate, which is subject to routine audit 
and review, in recognition of Ryanair's satisfaction of the relevant EU requirements for the operation of 
commercial air transport ("EU OPS 1"). The requirements of EU OPS 1 have been incorporated into European 
law as prescribed in Regulation (EEC) 3922/91 and were applied in full on July 16, 2008. All current 
regulatory requirements are addressed in the Ryanair Operations Manual Part A (as amended). The current 
Manual, Issue 3 Revision9, was approved by the IAA on October 31, 2013.
 Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport ("DTTAS") is 
responsible for implementation of certain EU and Irish legislation and international standards relating to 
air transport.
 In June 2005, the Irish Minister for Transport enacted legislation strengthening rights for air 
passengers following the enactment of EU legislation requiring compensation of airline passengers who have 
been denied boarding on a flight for which they hold a valid ticket (Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004), which 
came into force on February 17, 2005. See "Item 3. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Airline Industry-EU 
Regulation on Passenger Compensation Could Significantly Increase Related Costs."
 The European Aviation Safety Agency. EASA is an agency of the EU that has been given specific regulatory 
and executive tasks in the field of aviation safety. EASA was established through Regulation (EC) No. 
1592/2002 of the European Parliament and the Council of July 15, 2002, repealed by Basic Regulation (EC) 
216-2008. The purpose of EASA is to draw-up common standards to ensure the highest levels of safety, 
oversee their uniform application across Europe and promote them at the global level. The EASA formally 
started its work on September 28, 2003, taking over the responsibility for regulating airworthiness, 
maintenance and air crew issues within the EU member states.
 Eurocontrol. The European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation ("Eurocontrol") is an autonomous 
European organization established under the Eurocontrol Convention of December 13, 1960. Eurocontrol is 
responsible for, inter alia, the safety of air navigation and the collection of route charges for en route 
air navigation facilities and services throughout Europe. Ireland is a party to several international 
agreements concerning Eurocontrol. These agreements have been implemented in Irish law, which provides for 
the payment of charges to Eurocontrol in respect of air navigation services for aircraft in airspace under 
the control of Eurocontrol. The relevant legislation imposes liability for the payment of any charges upon 
the operators of the aircraft in respect of which services are provided and upon the owners of such 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -32-
aircraft or the managers of airports used by such aircraft. Ryanair, as an aircraft operator, is primarily 
responsible for the payment to Eurocontrol of charges incurred in relation to its aircraft.
 The legislation authorizes the detention of aircraft in the case of default in the payment of any charge 
for air navigation services by the aircraft operator or the aircraft owner, as the case may be. This power 
of detention extends to any equipment, stores or documents, which may be onboard the aircraft when it is 
detained, and may result in the possible sale of the aircraft.

 hedging contracts with respect to its expected fuel purchases beyond that period.
 While these hedging strategies can cushion the impact on Ryanair of fuel price increases in the short term, in the 
medium to longer-term, such strategies cannot be expected to eliminate the impact on the Company of an increase 
in the market price of jet fuel. The unrealized gains on outstanding forward agreements at March 31, 2014 and 
2013, based on their fair values, amounted to EUR17.2 million and EUR34.9 million (gross of tax), respectively. 
Based on Ryanair's fuel consumption for the 2014 fiscal year, a change of $1.00 in the average annual price per 
metric ton of jet fuel would have caused a change of approximately EUR2.0 million in Ryanair's fuel costs. See 
"Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability 
Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood that the Company May Incur Losses."
 Under IFRS, the Company's fuel forward contracts are treated as cash-flow hedges of forecast fuel purchases for 
risks arising from the commodity price of fuel. The contracts are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are 
re-measured to fair value at the end of each fiscal period through equity to the extent effective, with any 
ineffectiveness recorded through the income statement. The Company has considered these hedges to be highly 
effective in offsetting variability in future cash flows arising from fluctuations in the market price of jet fuel because 
the jet fuel forward contracts typically relate to the same quantity, time, and location of delivery as the forecast jet 
fuel purchase being hedged and the duration of the contracts is typically short. Accordingly, the quantification of the 
change in expected cash flows of the forecast jet fuel purchase is based on the jet fuel forward price, and in the 
2014 fiscal year, the Company recorded no hedge ineffectiveness within earnings. The Company has recorded no 
level of ineffectiveness on its jet fuel hedges in its income statements to date. In the 2014 fiscal year, the Company 
recorded a positive fair-value adjustment of EUR15.0 million (net of tax) within accumulated other comprehensive 
income in respect of jet fuel forward contracts, and in the 2013 fiscal year, the Company recorded a positive fair-
value adjustment of EUR30.6 million (net of tax) within accumulated other comprehensive income.
 FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE AND HEDGING
 In recent years, Ryanair's revenues have been denominated primarily in two currencies, the euro and U.K. pound 
sterling. The U.K. pound sterling and the euro accounted for approximately 25% and 63%, respectively, of Ryanair's 
total revenues in both the 2014 and 2013 fiscal years. As Ryanair reports its results in euro, the Company is not 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -59-
exposed to any material currency risk as a result of its euro-denominated activities. Ryanair's operating expenses 
are primarily denominated in euro, U.K. pounds sterling and U.S. dollars. Ryanair's operations can be subject to 
significant direct exchange rate risks between the euro and the U.S. dollar because a significant portion of its 
operating costs (particularly those related to fuel purchases) is incurred in U.S. dollars, while none of its revenues 
are denominated in U.S. dollars. Appreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar positively impacts Ryanair's 
operating income because the euro equivalent of its U.S. dollar operating costs decreases, while depreciation of the 
euro against the U.S. dollar negatively impacts operating income. It is Ryanair's policy to hedge a significant portion 
of its exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. From time to time, Ryanair 
hedges its operating surpluses and shortfalls in U.K. pound sterling. Ryanair matches certain U.K. pound sterling 
costs with U.K. pound sterling revenues and may choose to sell any surplus U.K. pound sterling cash flows for euro.
 Hedging associated with the income statement. In the 2014 and 2013 fiscal years, the Company entered into a 
series of forward contracts, principally euro/U.S. dollar forward contracts to hedge against variability in cash flows 
arising from market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates associated with its forecast fuel, maintenance and 
insurance costs and euro/U.K. pound sterling forward contracts to hedge certain surplus U.K. pound sterling cash 
flows. At March 31, 2014, the total unrealized loss relating to these contracts amounted to EUR51.2 million, 
compared to a EUR47.4 million unrealized gain at March 31, 2013.
 Under IFRS, these foreign currency forward contracts are treated as cash-flow hedges of forecast U.S. dollar and 
U.K. pound sterling purchases to address the risks arising from U.S. dollar and U.K. pound sterling exchange rates. 
The derivatives are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are re-measured to fair value at the end of each 
reporting period through equity to the extent effective, with ineffectiveness recorded through the income statement. 
Ryanair considers these hedges to be highly effective in offsetting variability in future cash flows arising from 
fluctuations in exchange rates, because the forward contracts are timed so as to match exactly the amount, 
currency and maturity date of the forecast foreign currency-denominated expense being hedged. In the 2014 fiscal 
year, the Company recorded a negative fair-value adjustment of EUR86.3 million (net of tax) within accumulated 
other comprehensive income in respect of these contracts, as compared to a negative adjustment of EUR42.3 
million in the 2013 fiscal year.
 Hedging associated with the balance sheet. In prior years, the Company entered into a series of cross currency 
interest rate swaps to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of US dollar-denominated 
floating rate borrowings, together with managing the exposures to fluctuations in interest rates on these US dollar-
denominated floating rate borrowings. Cross currency interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert a portion of 
the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated debt to euro and floating rate interest exposures into fixed rate exposures 
and are set so as to match exactly the critical terms of the underlying debt being hedged (i.e. notional principal, 
interest rate settings, re-pricing dates). These are all classified as cash-flow hedges of the forecasted U.S. dollar 
variable interest payments on the Company's underlying debt and have been determined to be highly effective in 
achieving offsetting cash flows. Accordingly, no ineffectiveness has been recorded in the income statement relating 
to these hedges.
 At March 31, 2014, the fair value of the cross currency interest rate swap agreements relating to this U.S. dollar-
denominated floating rate debt was represented by a loss of EUR25.9 million (gross of tax) compared to a loss of 
EUR11.7 million in fiscal 2013. In the 2014 fiscal year, the Company recorded a negative fair-value adjustment of 
EUR12.4 million (net of tax), compared to a loss of EUR3.7 million in fiscal 2013, within accumulated other 
comprehensive income in respect of these contracts.
 Hedging associated with capital expenditures. During the 2014 and 2013 fiscal years, the Company also entered 
into a series of euro/U.S. dollar contracts to hedge against changes in the fair value of aircraft purchase 
commitments under the Boeing contracts, which arise from fluctuations in the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rates. 
There were no such contracts in effect at March 31, 2013. At March 31, 2014, the total unrealized loss relating to 
these contracts amounted to EUR15.0 million.
 Under IFRS, the Company generally accounts for these contracts as either cash-flow hedges or fair-value hedges. 
Fair-value hedges are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value. Any gains or losses arising on these instruments, 
as well as the related gain or loss on the underlying aircraft purchase commitment, are recorded in the balance 
sheet. Any related ineffectiveness is measured by the amount by which these adjustments to earnings do not 
match. Cash-flow hedges are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are re-measured to fair value at the 
end of the financial period through equity to the extent effective, with any ineffectiveness recorded through the 
income statement. The Company has found these hedges to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -59-
value of the aircraft purchase commitments arising from fluctuations in exchange rates because the forward 
exchange contracts are always for the same amount, currency and maturity dates as the corresponding aircraft 
purchase commitments.
 At March 31, 2014, the total unrealized losses relating to these contracts amounted to EUR15.0 million, while at 
March 31, 2013 unrealized gains amounted to EURnil. Under IFRS, the Company recorded fair-value adjustments 
of EUR13.1 million and fair-value adjustments of EURnil for cash-flow hedges in the 2014 and 2013 fiscal years, 
respectively. No amounts were recorded for such fair-value hedges from other accumulated comprehensive income 
in the 2014 and 2013 fiscal years.
 Holding other variables constant, if there were an adverse change of 10% in relevant foreign currency exchange 
rates, the market value of Ryanair's foreign currency contracts outstanding at March 31, 2014 would decrease by 
approximately EUR294.0 million (net of tax), all of which would ultimately impact earnings when such contracts 
mature.

 Item 4. Information on the Company
 INTRODUCTION
 Ryanair Holdings was incorporated in 1996 as a holding company for Ryanair Limited. The latter operates an ultra-
low cost, scheduled-passenger airline serving short-haul, point-to-point routes between Ireland, the U.K., 
Continental Europe, and Morocco. Incorporated on November 28, 1984, Ryanair Limited began to introduce a low-
fares operating model under a new management team in the early 1990s. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial 
Review and Prospects 3/4 History." As of June 30, 2014, Ryanair had a principal fleet of 297 Boeing 737-800 
aircraft and 5 additional leased aircraft acquired on short term leases for the summer of 2014 to provide extra 
capacity, Ryanair Limited offered over 1,600 scheduled short-haul flights per day serving approximately 186 airports 
largely throughout Europe. See " 3/4 Route System, Scheduling and Fares 3/4 Route System and Scheduling" for 
more details of Ryanair's route network. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 3/4 Seasonal 
Fluctuations" for information about the seasonality of Ryanair's business.
 Ryanair recorded a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR522.8 million in the 2014 fiscal year, as 
compared to a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR569.3 million in the 2013 fiscal year. This decrease 
of approximately 8% was primarily attributable to an increase in fuel costs of approximately 7% from EUR1,885.6 
million to EUR2,013.1 million, and a reduction of approximately 4% in average fares, offset by strong ancillary 
revenues growth and increased traffic. Ryanair generated an average booked passenger load factor of 
approximately 83% in fiscal 2014, compared to 82% in fiscal 2013, and average booked passenger fare of 
EUR46.40 per passenger in the 2014 fiscal year, down from EUR48.20 in the prior fiscal year. The Company has 
focused on maintaining low operating costs (EUR53.61 per passenger in the 2014 fiscal year, an increase from 
EUR52.56 in fiscal 2013).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -25-
 The market's acceptance of Ryanair's low-fares service is reflected in the "Ryanair Effect" - Ryanair's history of 
stimulating significant annual passenger traffic growth on the new routes on which it has commenced service since 
1991. For example, on the basis of the "U.K. Airports Annual Statement of Movements, Passengers and Cargo" 
published by the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority and statistics released by the International Civil Aviation Organization 
(the "ICAO"), the number of scheduled airline passengers traveling between Dublin and London increased from 1.7 
million passengers in 1991 to 3.9 million passengers in the 2013 calendar year. Most international routes Ryanair 
has begun serving since 1991 have recorded significant traffic growth in the period following Ryanair's 
commencement of service, with Ryanair capturing the largest portion of such growth on each such route. A variety 
of factors contributed to this increase in air passenger traffic, including the relative strength of the Irish, U.K., and 
European economies in past years. However, management believes that the most significant factors driving such 
growth across all its European routes have been Ryanair's low-fares policy and its superiority to its competitors in 
terms of flight punctuality, levels of lost baggage, and rates of flight cancellations.

 STRATEGY
 Ryanair's objective is to firmly establish itself as Europe's biggest scheduled passenger airline, through continued 
improvements and expanded offerings of its low-fares service. In the highly challenging current operating 
environment, Ryanair seeks to offer low fares that generate increased passenger traffic while maintaining a 
continuous focus on cost-containment and operating efficiencies. The key elements of Ryanair's long-term strategy 
are:
 Low Fares. Ryanair's low fares are designed to stimulate demand, particularly from fare-conscious leisure and 
business travelers who might otherwise use alternative forms of transportation or choose not to travel at all. Ryanair 
sells seats on a one-way basis, thus eliminating minimum stay requirements from all travel on Ryanair scheduled 
services. Ryanair sets fares on the basis of the demand for particular flights and by reference to the period 
remaining to the date of departure of the flight, with higher fares typically charged on flights with higher levels of 
demand and for bookings made nearer to the date of departure. Ryanair also periodically runs special promotional 
fare campaigns. See "-Route System, Scheduling and Fares-Low and Widely Available Fares" below.
 Customer Service. Ryanair's strategy is to deliver the best customer service performance in its peer group. 
According to the data available from the Association of European Airlines ("AEA") and airlines' own published 
statistics, Ryanair has achieved better punctuality, fewer lost bags, and fewer cancellations than its peer group in 
Europe. Ryanair achieves this by focusing strongly on the execution of these services and by primarily operating 
from un-congested airports. Ryanair conducts a daily conference call with airport personnel at each of its base 
airports, during which the reasons for each "first wave" flight delay and baggage short-shipment are discussed in 
detail and logged to ensure that the root cause is identified and rectified. Subsequent (consequential) delays and 
short shipments are investigated by Ryanair ground operations personnel. Customer satisfaction is also measured 
by regular online, mystery-passenger and by passenger surveys.
 Ryanair is implementing a series of strategic initiatives that are expected to have a significant impact on its 
customer service offering. Ryanair has also announced and introduced a series of customer-service related 
initiatives, including a new, easier-to-navigate website with a fare finder facility, reduced penalty fees, allocated 
seating and more customer-friendly baggage allowances and change policies. Further, these initiatives include 
scheduling more flights to primary airports, selling flights via travel agents on GDS, increasing marketing spending 
significantly to support these initiatives, and adjusting the airline's yield management strategy with the goal of 
increasing load factors and yield.
 Frequent Point-to-Point Flights on Short-Haul Routes. Ryanair provides frequent point-to-point service on short-
haul routes to secondary, regional, and more recently, certain primary airports in and around major population 
centers and travel destinations. In the 2014 fiscal year, Ryanair flew an average route length of 788 miles and an 
average flight duration of approximately 1.87 hours. Short-haul routes allow Ryanair to offer its low fares and 
frequent service, while eliminating the need to provide unnecessary "frills," like free in-flight meals and movies, 
otherwise expected by customers on longer flights. Point-to-point flying (as opposed to hub-and-spoke service) 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -25-
allows Ryanair to offer direct, non-stop routes and avoid the costs of providing "through service," for connecting 
passengers, including baggage transfer and transit passenger assistance.
 In choosing its routes, Ryanair primarily favors secondary airports with convenient transportation to major 
population centers and regional airports. Secondary and regional airports are generally less congested than major 
airports and, as a result, can be expected to provide higher rates of on-time departures, faster turnaround times (the 
time an aircraft spends at a gate loading and unloading passengers), fewer terminal delays, more competitive 
airport access, and lower handling costs. As part of its strategic initiatives, Ryanair plans to increase the number of 
primary airports that it serves, focussing particularly on those that facilitate a quick turnaround and offer 
opportunities for the Company to profitably enhance its route choice by adding city pairs that are attractive to both 
business and leisure customers alike. Ryanair's "on time" performance record (arrivals within 15 minutes of 
schedule) for the 2014 fiscal year was 92%. Faster turnaround times are a key element in Ryanair's efforts to 
maximize aircraft utilization. Ryanair's average scheduled turnaround time for the 2014 fiscal year was 
approximately 25 minutes.
 Low Operating Costs. Management believes that Ryanair's operating costs are among the lowest of any European 
scheduled-passenger airline. Ryanair strives to reduce or control four of the primary expenses involved in running a 
major scheduled airline: (i) aircraft equipment costs; (ii) personnel costs; (iii) customer service costs; and (iv) airport 
access and handling costs:

 ===========  =========  =========
* Decrease on prior year due to lower aircraft in operation in March 2014 and cabin crew staff being furloughed.
 Ryanair's pilots, flight attendants and maintenance and ground operations personnel undergo training, both initial 
and recurrent. A substantial portion of the initial training for Ryanair's flight attendants is devoted to safety 
procedures, and cabin crew are required to undergo annual evacuation and fire drill training during their tenure with 
the airline. Ryanair also provides salary increases to its engineers who complete advanced training in certain fields 
of aircraft maintenance. Ryanair utilizes its own Boeing 737-800 aircraft simulators for pilot training.
 IAA regulations require pilots to be licensed as commercial pilots with specific ratings for each aircraft to be flown. 
In addition, IAA regulations require all commercial pilots to be medically certified as physically fit. At March 31, 
2014, the average age of Ryanair's pilots was 35 years and their average period of employment with Ryanair was 
5.2 years. Licenses and medical certification are subject to periodic re-evaluation and require recurrent training and 
recent flying experience in order to be maintained. Maintenance engineers must be licensed and qualified for 
specific aircraft types. Flight attendants must undergo initial and periodic competency training. Training programs 
are subject to approval and monitoring by the IAA. In addition, the appointment of senior management personnel 
directly involved in the supervision of flight operations, training, maintenance and aircraft inspection must be 
satisfactory to the IAA. Based on its experience in managing the airline's growth to date, management believes that 
there is a sufficient pool of qualified and licensed pilots, engineers and mechanics within the EU to satisfy Ryanair's 
anticipated future needs in the areas of flight operations, maintenance and quality control and that Ryanair will not 
face significant difficulty in hiring and continuing to employ the required personnel. Ryanair has also been able to 
satisfy its needs for additional pilots through the use of contract agencies.  These contract pilots are included in the 
table above. In addition, Ryanair has also been able to satisfy its needs for additional flight attendants through the 
use of contract agencies. These contract flight attendants are included in the table above.
 Ryanair has a licensed approved organization in Holland to operate pilot training courses using Ryanair's syllabus, 
in order to grant Boeing 737 type-ratings. Each trainee pilot must pay for his or her own training and, based on his 
or her performance, he or she may be offered a position operating on Ryanair aircraft. This program enables 
Ryanair to secure a continuous stream of type-rated co-pilots.
 Ryanair's crews earn productivity-based incentive payments, including a sales bonus for onboard sales for flight 
attendants and payments based on the number of hours or sectors flown by pilots and flight attendants (within limits 
set by industry standards or regulations fixing maximum working hours). During the 2014 fiscal year, such 
productivity-based incentive payments accounted for approximately 44% of an average flight attendant's total 
earnings and approximately 32% of the typical pilot's compensation. Pilots at 65 out of Ryanair's 69 bases are 
covered by four or five year agreements on pay, allowances and rosters which fall due for negotiation at various 
dates between 2014 and 2019. Cabin crew at all Ryanair bases are also party to long term collective agreements 
on pay, allowances and rosters which expire March 2017. In March 2013, Ryanair agreed to increase the pay of 
pilots and cabin crew in accordance with the terms of individual base agreements. Ryanair's pilots are currently 
subject to IAA-approved limits of 100 flight-hours per 28-day cycle and 900 flight-hours per fiscal year. For the 2014 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -47-
fiscal year, the average flight-hours for Ryanair's pilots amounted to approximately 68 hours per month and 
approximately 812 hours for the complete year, an approximately 2% increase on the previous fiscal year. If more 
stringent regulations on flight hours were to be adopted, Ryanair's flight personnel could experience a reduction in 
their total pay due to lower compensation for the number of hours or sectors flown and Ryanair could be required to 
hire additional flight personnel.
 Ryanair considers its relations with its employees to be good. Ryanair currently negotiates with groups of 
employees, including its pilots, through "Employee Representation Committees" ("ERCs") regarding pay, work 
practices and conditions of employment, including conducting formal negotiations with these internal collective 
bargaining units. Ryanair's senior management meets regularly with the different ERCs to discuss all aspects of the 
business and those issues that specifically relate to each relevant employee group.
 Ryanair Holdings' shareholders have approved a number of share option plans for employees and directors. 
Ryanair Holdings has also issued share options to certain of its senior managers. For details of all outstanding 
share options, see "Item 10. Additional Information--Options to Purchase Securities from Registrant or 
Subsidiaries."
 Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions
 As of June 30, 2014, there were 1,384,203,806 Ordinary Shares outstanding. As of that date, 112,316,349 ADRs, 
representing 561,581,745 Ordinary Shares, were held of record in the United States by 55 holders, and represented

 Under the terms of the 2013 Boeing Contract, Ryanair has agreed to purchase the 180 new aircraft over a five year 
period from fiscal 2015 to 2019, with delivery beginning in September 2014. The new aircraft will benefit from a net 
effective price not dissimilar to that under the 2005 Boeing Contract which was approved by shareholders in 2005 
and will be used on new and existing routes to grow Ryanair's business.
 The Boeing 737-800 represents the current generation of Boeing's 737 aircraft. It is a short-to-medium range 
aircraft and seats 189 passengers. The basic price (equivalent to a standard list price for an aircraft of this type) for 
each of the Boeing 737-800 series aircraft is approximately US$78.1 million and the basic price will be increased for 
certain "buyer-furnished" equipment, amounting to approximately US$2.9 million per new aircraft, which Ryanair 
has asked Boeing to purchase and install on each of the new aircraft. In addition, an "Escalation Factor" will be 
applied to the basic price to reflect increases in the Employment Cost Index and Producer Price Index between the 
time the basic price was set in the 2013 Boeing Contract and the period 18 to 24 months prior to the delivery of any 
such new aircraft.
 Boeing has granted Ryanair certain price concessions as part of the 2013 Boeing Contract. These will take the 
form of credit memoranda to Ryanair for the amount of such concessions, which Ryanair may apply toward the 
purchase of goods and services from Boeing or toward certain payments, other than advance payments, in respect 
of the new aircraft. Boeing and CFMI (the manufacturer of the engines to be fitted on the new aircraft) have also 
agreed to provide Ryanair with certain allowances for promotional and other activities, as well as providing certain 
other goods and services to Ryanair on concessionary terms. Those credit memoranda and promotional allowances 
will effectively reduce the price of each new aircraft payable by Ryanair. As a result, the "effective price" (the 
purchase price of the new aircraft net of discounts received from Boeing) of each new aircraft will be significantly 
below the basic price mentioned above. The effective price applies to all new aircraft due for delivery from 
September 2014.
 For additional details on the Boeing contracts, scheduled aircraft deliveries and related expenditures and their 
financing, as well as the terms of the arrangements under which Ryanair currently leases 51 of the aircraft in its 
operating fleet, see "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Liquidity and Capital Resources."
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -28-
 The Boeing 737 is the world's most widely used commercial aircraft and exists in a number of generations, the 
Boeing 737-800s being the most recent. Management believes that spare parts and cockpit crews qualified to fly 
these aircraft are likely to be more widely available on favorable terms than similar resources for other types of 
aircraft. Management believes that its strategy, to date, of having reduced its fleet to one aircraft type enables 
Ryanair to limit the costs associated with personnel training, the purchase and storage of spare parts, and 
maintenance. Furthermore, this strategy affords Ryanair greater flexibility in the scheduling of crews and 
equipment. The Boeing 737-800s are fitted with CFM 56-7B engines and have advanced CAT III Autoland 
capability, advanced traffic collision avoidance systems, and enhanced ground-proximity warning systems. During 
fiscal 2012, Boeing announced that it was going to manufacture a variant of the 737 with new, more fuel-efficient 
engines called the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. A senior Ryanair working group is continuing to evaluate the benefits 
of the MAX aircraft. This new variant could impact the Company insofar as the residual value of its aircraft could be 
reduced when this new variant enters production, currently expected to be in late 2017.
 At March 31, 2014, the average aircraft age of the Company's Boeing 737-800 fleet was just over 5.5 years.
 Training and Regulatory Compliance
 Ryanair currently owns and operates four Boeing 737-800 full flight simulators for pilot training, the first of which 
was delivered in 2002. The simulators were purchased from CAE Electronics Ltd. of Quebec, Canada ("CAE"). The 
second simulator was delivered in 2004, while the third and fourth simulators were delivered in the 2008 fiscal year. 
In September 2006, Ryanair entered into a new contract with CAE to purchase B737NG Level B flight simulators. 
Two such simulators were delivered in the 2009 fiscal year.
 Management believes that Ryanair is currently in compliance with all applicable regulations and EU directives 
concerning its fleet of Boeing 737-800 aircraft and will comply with any regulations or EU directives that may come 
into effect in the future. However, there can be no assurance that the FAA or other regulatory authorities will not 
recommend or require other safety-related undertakings that could adversely impact the Company's results of 
operations or financial condition. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Safety-Related Undertakings Could 
Affect the Company's Results."
 ANCILLARY SERVICES
 Ryanair provides various ancillary services and engages in other activities connected with its core air passenger 
service, including non-flight scheduled services, Internet-related services, and the in-flight sale of beverages, food, 
and merchandise. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Results of Operations-Fiscal Year 
2014 Compared with Fiscal Year 2013-Ancillary Revenues" for additional information.
 As part of its non-flight scheduled and Internet-related services, Ryanair incentivizes ground service providers at 
many of the airports it serves to levy correct excess baggage charges for any baggage that exceeds Ryanair's 
published baggage allowances and to collect these charges in accordance with Ryanair's standard terms and 
conditions. Excess baggage charges are recorded as non-flight scheduled revenue.
 Ryanair primarily markets accommodation services and travel insurance through its website. For hotel and 
accommodation services, Ryanair has a contract with Hotelscombined PTY Ltd. ("Hotelscombined"), which 
operates a price comparison website, pursuant to which Hotelscombined handles all aspects of such services 
marketed through Ryanair's website and pays a fee to Ryanair. Ryanair also has a contract with Bookings.com to 
market hotels during the booking process on its website and Ryanair receives a commission on these sales. In 
addition, Ryanair has a contract with Hertz, pursuant to which Hertz handles all car rental services marketed 
through Ryanair's website or telephone reservation system.
 Ryanair also sells bus and some rail tickets onboard its aircraft and through its website. In addition, Ryanair 
markets car parking, attractions and activities on its website, with the latter having gone on sale in-flight in spring 
2012.
 Ryanair sells gift vouchers on its website, which are redeemable online. In May 2009, Ryanair started to offer its 
passengers the possibility of receiving an SMS (text message) when booking, at a modest fee, to inform them of 
their flight confirmation details.
 In April 2009, Ryanair signed a contract with Webloyalty International Ltd, which offers Ryanair's customers who 
have a UK, German or French billing address a retail discount and cash-back program. A similar contract was 
signed in 2013 with LEV-8 for customers with billing addresses in Norway, Poland, Portugal and Sweden. In April 
2011, Ryanair began to sell advertising on its boarding cards. In fiscal 2012, a boarding card redesign along with 
increased passenger volumes allowed for further growth in this area.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -28-
 In fiscal year 2012, Ryanair rolled out handheld Electronic Point of Sale ("EPOS") devices across its route network. 
These EPOS devices replaced manual and paper based systems on board the aircraft. The EPOS device enables 
cabin crew to sell and record their on-board sales transactions more efficiently and generate vastly improved 
management sales reporting. The EPOS device also issues bus and rail tickets and tickets for tourist attractions.
 In fiscal year 2011, Ryanair began offering reserved seating in twenty-one extra legroom seats on each aircraft for 
a fee on certain routes and this feature was rolled out to all routes in fiscal year 2012. In February 2014, Ryanair 
introduced fully allocated seating on each of its flights.  Passengers can pay a fee of EUR10 for seats located at the 
front of the aircraft, at the overwing exits and at the two rear rows of the aircraft.  All other seats can be reserved for 
a fee of EUR5. In the event a passenger does not wish to purchase an allocated seat, a random seat will be 
allocated during the booking process.
 In November 2013, the Company launched a new website which reduced the number of clicks to make a booking 
from 17 to 5.  At the same time, the Company reduced the exposure of certain other ancillary products during the 
booking process on the website which had a negative impact on sales along with a reduction of certain penalty fees 
and charges at airports.  The Company anticipates that the reduction in revenues arising from these changes will be 
offset by the increased revenues arising from allocated seating. See "Item 3 Key Information-Risk Factors-Ryanair 
May Not Achieve All of the Expected Benefits of its Recent Strategic Initiatives".
 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS
 General
 As part of its commitment to safety, Ryanair endeavors to hire qualified maintenance personnel, provide proper 
training to such personnel, and maintain its aircraft in accordance with European industry standards. While Ryanair 
seeks to maintain its fleet in a cost-effective manner, management does not seek to extend Ryanair's low-cost 
operating strategy to the areas of maintenance, training or quality control.

Body
 Ryanair's quality assurance department deals with oversight of all maintenance activities in accordance with Part 
145. The European Aviation Safety Agency ("EASA"), which established Part 145, came into being on September 
28, 2003; through the adoption of Regulation (EC) No. 1592/2002 of the European Parliament, and its standards 
superseded the previous Joint Aviation Authority ("JAA") requirements. See " 3/4 Government Regulation 3/4 
Regulatory Authorities."
 Ryanair is itself an EASA Part 145-approved maintenance contractor and provides its own routine aircraft 
maintenance and repair services. Ryanair also performs certain checks on its aircraft, including pre-flight, daily, and 
transit checks at some of its bases, as well as A-checks at its Dublin, London (Stansted), Glasgow (Prestwick), 
Bremen and Frankfurt (Hahn) facilities. Since December 2003, Ryanair has operated a hangar facility at its base at 
Glasgow (Prestwick) in Scotland, where both A-checks and C-checks are performed on the fleet of Boeing 737-800 
aircraft. The facility performs up to four C-checks per week and Ryanair has recently opened a new C-check hangar 
facility in Kaunas, Lithuania where it carries out between one and two light C-checks per week, enabling Ryanair to 
perform all of the heavy maintenance that is currently required on its Boeing 737-800 fleet in-house. In January 
2014, Ryanair opened another single bay hangar facility in Kaunas.
 Ryanair opened a five-bay hangar and stores facility at its London (Stansted) airport base in October 2008 to allow 
Ryanair to carry out additional line maintenance on its expanding fleet. This facility also incorporates two flight 
simulator devices with space and provisions for two more, together with a cabin crew trainer and associated training 
rooms. Ryanair has completed the building of a separate training facility adjacent to the hangar to accommodate a 
full size 737NG training aircraft to allow for cabin crew and engineering training. Ryanair carries out A-checks and 
line maintenance in its single-bay aircraft hangar facility in Bremen. Ryanair has also entered into a 30-year sole-
tenancy agreement with Frankfurt (Hahn) airport and has taken acceptance of a two-bay hangar and stores facility 
that also incorporates a two-bay simulator-training center. This facility was completed in January 2011 and allows 
Ryanair to carry out additional line maintenance including A-checks.
 Maintenance and repair services that may become necessary while an aircraft is located at some of the other 
airports served by Ryanair are provided by other Part 145-approved contract maintenance providers. Aircraft return

145-approved companies.
 Heavy Maintenance
 As noted above, Ryanair currently has sufficient capacity to be able to carry out all of the routine maintenance work 
required on its Boeing 737-800 fleet itself. Ryanair opened a new three-bay maintenance hangar at Glasgow 
(Prestwick) airport in winter 2010 to accommodate the additional maintenance requirements arising from its 
expanding and aging fleet and opened a new C-check facility in Kaunas in January 2013 to carry out light C-checks.
 Ryanair contracts out engine overhaul service for its Boeing 737-800 aircraft to General Electric Engine Services 
pursuant to a 10-year agreement with an option for a 10-year extension, which was signed in 2004 and 
subsequently extended for three years to November 30, 2017. This comprehensive maintenance contract provides 
for the repair and overhaul of the CFM56-7B series engines fitted to the first 155 of Ryanair's Boeing 737-800 
aircraft, the repair of parts and general technical support for the fleet of engines. On June 30, 2008, the Company 
finalized a contract for a similar level of coverage and support for the engines on all of its aircraft that have been or 
were scheduled to be delivered over the period through November 2012. Due to the fact that engines on recently 
delivered aircraft will not require a scheduled engine overhaul prior to the expiry of the current contract with GE, 
Ryanair has decided, at this time, not to take up its option to have engines delivered with aircraft after October 2010 
covered by this contract. General Electric Engine Services mainly uses its Part 145-approved repair facility in 
Cardiff, Wales for this work, but also uses the KLM Part 145-approved facility in Amsterdam, and its Part 145-
approved facility in Celma, Brazil. By contracting with experienced Part 145-approved maintenance providers, 
management believes it is better able to ensure the quality of its aircraft and engine maintenance. Ryanair assigns 
a Part 145-certified mechanic to oversee all heavy maintenance and to authorize all engine overhauls performed by 
third parties. Maintenance providers are also monitored closely by the national authorities under EASA and national 
regulations.
 Ryanair expects to be dependent on external service contractors, particularly for engine and component 
maintenance, for the foreseeable future, notwithstanding the additional capabilities provided by its maintenance 
facilities at Dublin, Glasgow (Prestwick), London (Stansted), Frankfurt (Hahn) and Kaunas. See "Item 3. Key 
Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-The Company Is Dependent on External Service 
Providers."
 SAFETY RECORD
 Ryanair has not had a single passenger or flight crew fatality in its 30-year operating history. Ryanair demonstrates 
its commitment to safe operations through its safety training procedures, its investment in safety-related equipment, 
and its adoption of an internal open and confidential reporting system for safety issues. The Company's Board of 
Directors also has an air safety committee to review and discuss air safety and related issues. Michael Horgan, a 
Company director, is the chairman of this committee and reports to the Board of Directors.
 Ryanair's flight training is oriented towards accident prevention and covers all aspects of flight operations. Threat 
and Error Management (TEM) is at the core of all flight crew training programs. Ryanair maintains full control of the 
content and delivery of all of its flight crew training, including initial, recurrent, and upgrade phases. All training 
programs are approved by the Irish Aviation Authority (the "IAA"), which regularly audits operation control standards 
and flight crew training standards for compliance with EU legislation.
 All of the Boeing 737-800s that Ryanair has bought or committed to buy are certified for Category IIIA landings 
(automatic landings with minimum horizontal visibility of 200 meters and a 50 feet decision height).
 Ryanair has a comprehensive and documented safety management system. Management encourages flight crews 
to report any safety-related issues through the Safety Alert Initial Report reporting program or to use the confidential 
reporting system, which is available online through Ryanair's Crewdock system. The confidential reporting system 
affords flight crews the opportunity to report directly to the Flight Safety Officer any event, error, or discrepancy in 
flight operations that they do not wish to report through standard reporting channels. The confidential reporting 
system is designed to increase management's awareness of problems that may be encountered by flight crews in 
their day-to-day operations. Management uses the information reported through all reporting systems to modify 
operating procedures and improve flight operation standards. Additionally, Ryanair promotes the use of CHIRP, a 
confidential reporting system that is endorsed by the UK CAA as an alternative confidential reporting channel.
 Ryanair has installed an automatic data capturing system on each of its Boeing 737-800 aircraft which captures 
and downloads aircraft performance information for use as part of Operational Flight Data Monitoring (OFDM) which 
automatically provides a confidential report on variations from normal operating limitations detected during the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -29-
course of each flight. The purpose of this system is to monitor operational trends and inform management of any 
instance of an operational limit being exceeded. By analyzing these reports, management is able to identify 
undesirable trends and potential areas of operational risk, so as to take steps to rectify such deviations, thereby 
ensuring adherence to Ryanair's flight safety standards.
 In November 2008, a Ryanair aircraft suffered a multiple bird strike during its final approach to Rome (Ciampino) 
airport. This incident caused substantial damage to the aircraft, which resulted in an insurance claim being filed in 
respect of this aircraft. The damage that it suffered was such that the aircraft was not repaired, although Ryanair 
has retained ownership of it for certain parts and for training purposes.
 AIRPORT OPERATIONS
 Airport Handling Services
 Ryanair provides its own aircraft and passenger handling and ticketing services at Dublin Airport. Third parties 
provide these services to Ryanair at most other airports it serves. Servisair plc provides Ryanair's ticketing, 
passenger and aircraft handling, and ground handling services at many of these airports in Ireland and the U.K. 
(excluding London (Stansted) Airport where these services are provided primarily by Swissport Ltd.), while similar 
services in continental Europe are generally provided by the local airport authorities, either directly or through sub-
contractors. Management attempts to obtain competitive rates for such services by negotiating multi-year contracts 
at fixed prices. These contracts are generally scheduled to expire in one to five years, unless renewed, and certain 
of them may be terminated by either party before their expiry upon prior notice. Ryanair will need to enter into 
similar agreements in any new markets it may enter. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to 
the Company-The Company Is Dependent on External Service Providers."

Body
 Ryanair has its primary listing on the Irish Stock Exchange, a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange and 
its American Depositary Shares are listed on the NASDAQ. The directors are committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance and this statement describes how Ryanair has applied the main and supporting 
principles of the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 2012 Code).  This Report also covers the disclosure 
requirements set out in the corporate governance annex to the listing rules of the Irish Stock Exchange, which 
supplements the 2012 Code with additional corporate governance provisions and is also applicable to Ryanair.
 A copy of the 2012 Code can be obtained from the Financial Reporting Council's website, www.frc.org.uk. The Irish 
Corporate Governance Annex is available on the Irish Stock Exchange's website,            www.ise.ie.
 The Board of Directors (the Board)
 Roles
 The Board of Ryanair is responsible for the leadership, strategic direction and oversight of management of the 
Group. The Board's primary focus is on strategy formulation, policy and control. It has a formal schedule of matters 
specifically reserved to it for its attention, including matters such as approval of the annual budget, large capital 
expenditure, and key strategic decisions.
 Other matters reserved to the Board include treasury policy, internal control, audit and risk management, 
remuneration of the non-executive Directors and Executive management and Corporate Governance.
 The Board has delegated responsibility for the management of the Group to the Chief Executive and executive 
management.
 There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive, which is set out in 
writing and has been approved by the Board.
 Chairman
 David Bonderman has served as the chairman of the Board since December 1996. The Chairman's primary 
responsibility is to lead the Board, to ensure that it has a common purpose, is effective as a group and at individual 
director level and that it upholds and promotes high standards of integrity and corporate governance. He ensures 
that Board agendas cover the key strategic issues confronting the Group; that the Board reviews and approves 
management's plans for the Group; and that directors receive accurate, timely, clear and relevant information.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -5-
 The Chairman is the link between the Board and the Company. He is specifically responsible for establishing and 
maintaining an effective working relationship with the Chief Executive, for ensuring effective and appropriate 
communications with shareholders and for ensuring that members of the Board develop and maintain an 
understanding of the views of shareholders.
 While David Bonderman holds a number of other directorships (See details on page 106), the Board considers that 
these do not interfere with the discharge of his duties to Ryanair.
 Senior Independent Director
 The Board has appointed James Osborne as the Senior Independent Director. James Osborne is available to 
shareholders who have concerns that cannot be addressed through the Chairman, Chief Executive or Chief 
Financial Officer and leads the annual Board review of the performance of the Chairman.
 Company Secretary
 The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board. All directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board procedures 
are complied with.
 Membership
 The Board consists of one executive and nine non-executive directors. It is the practice of Ryanair that a majority of 
the Board comprises non-executive directors, considered by the Board to be independent, and that the Chairman is 
non-executive.  The Board considers the current size, composition and diversity of the Board to be within a range 
which is appropriate.  The composition of the Board and the principal Board Committees are set out in the table 
below. Brief biographies of the directors are set out on pages 106 and 107. The Board, with the assistance of the 
Nomination Committee, keeps Board composition under review to ensure that it includes the necessary mix of 
relevant skills and experience required to perform its role.
 Each director has extensive business experience, which they bring to bear in governing the Company. The Board 
considers that, between them, the directors bring the range of skills, knowledge and experience, including 
international experience, necessary to lead the Company. The Company has a Chairman with an extensive 
background in this industry, and significant public company experience. Historically, the Company has always 
separated the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive for the running of the business and implementation of the 
Board's strategy and policy.

 Appointment
 Directors can only be appointed following selection by the Nomination Committee and approval by the Board 
and must be elected by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting following their appointment. The 
focus of the Board, through the Nomination Committee, is to maintain a Board comprising the relevant 
expertise, quality and experience required by Ryanair to advance the Company and shareholder value. 
Ryanair recognise the benefits of gender diversity. Ryanair's Articles of Association require that all of 
the directors retire and offer themselves for re-election within a three-year period. One third (rounded 
down to the next whole number if it is a fractional number) of the directors (being the directors who have 
been longest in office) will retire by rotation and be eligible for re-election at every Annual General 
Meeting. Accordingly David Bonderman, James Osborne and Michael O'Leary will be offering themselves for 
re-election at the AGM on September 25, 2014.  In addition, Michael Cawley, who was Ryanair's Chief 
Operating Officer up to March 2014 will also offer himself for appointment to the Board of Directors at 
the next Annual General Meeting.
 In accordance with the recommendations of the 2012 Code, Declan McKeon is Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and James Osborne, the senior non-executive director, is Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
 Senior Management regularly briefs the Board, including new members, in relation to operating, financial 
and strategic issues concerning the Company. The Board also have direct access to senior management as 
required in relation to any issues they have concerning the operation of the Company. The terms and 
conditions of appointment of non-executive directors are set out in their letters of appointment, which 
are available for inspection at the Company's registered office during normal office hours and at the 
Annual General Meeting of the Company.

Body
 Ryanair is headquartered and managed and controlled from Ireland. Nevertheless, Ryanair operates 
extensively across Europe and Morocco in North Africa.  Airlines' profits on international flights are 
taxed in the country of residence of the airline which for Ryanair is Ireland.  Profits from domestic 
flights which are flights within one country are often taxable in that jurisdiction.  In addition to 
corporate taxes, Ryanair is subject to Value Added Tax ("VAT"), passenger taxes (which are levies on 
passengers collected by Ryanair and paid to the relevant taxing authority) and taxes on employment.  Due 
to the interplay between tax laws in individual jurisdictions and the nature of the industry whereby 
operations can begin and end in different jurisdictions, there is significant complexity in determining 
corporation tax liability, VAT and payroll tax obligations.  This risk is further highlighted in the 
report from the Audit Committee on page 22.
 Our audit procedures included:
 --  Obtaining and inspecting Ryanair's various tax filings in the principal jurisdictions in which it 
operates and its correspondence with tax authorities.
 --  Engaging KPMG tax specialists in each impacted jurisdiction to assist with our audit of Ryanair's tax 
obligations.
 --  Challenging the key assumptions impacting on the critical estimates and judgements made by Ryanair in 
determining its tax liabilities.
 --  Assessing whether Ryanair's disclosures repeated the risks inherent in the accounting for taxation 
balances and related contingencies.
 Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Ryanair Holdings plc (continued)
 Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit (continued)
 3              Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
 Materiality is a term used to describe the acceptable level of precision in financial statements. 
Auditing standards describe a misstatement or an omission as "material" if it could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.  We identify 
a monetary amount "materiality for the financial statements as a whole" based on this criteria and apply 
the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, and in evaluating the effect of 
identified misstatements on the audit and of uncorrected misstatements, if any, on the financial 
statements and in forming our opinion on them.
 The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at EUR29.5 million. This has been 
calculated using a benchmark of the Group's profit before tax for the year from continuing operations 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -12-
which we have determined, in our professional judgment, to be the principal financial consideration for 
members of the company in assessing financial performance.
 We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we 
identified through our audit with a value in excess of EUR1.4 million, in addition to other audit 
misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
 Ryanair is headquartered, managed and controlled from Ireland, and the audit work covering all of the 
Group's revenues, profit for the year and all of its assets and liabilities is undertaken by an audit team 
based in Dublin.
 The Group has a number of subsidiary entities both in Ireland and in foreign jurisdictions. Statutory 
audits of these entities are performed by KPMG Ireland or one of its international affiliates in the local 
jurisdiction. These audits are performed to local materiality levels. The statutory audits are not 
performed for group reporting purposes and are generally completed after the date of this report.
 4              We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
 ISAs (UK and Ireland) require that we report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our 
audit, we have identified information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with 
either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise 
misleading.
 In particular, we are required to report to you if:
 --   we have identified any inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the 
directors' statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides information necessary for shareholders to assess the entity's performance, business model and 
strategy; or
 --   the Report from the Audit Committee included in the Corporate Governance Report does not 
appropriately disclose those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee.
 The Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange and UK Listing Authority require us to review:
 --   the directors' statement, set out on page 28, in relation to going concern;
 --   the part of the Corporate Governance Report relating to the company's compliance with the nine 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the two provisions of the Irish Corporate Governance 
Annex specified for our review; and
 --   certain elements of disclosures in the report to shareholders by the Board of directors' 
remuneration.
 In addition, the Companies Acts require us to report to you if, in our opinion, the disclosures of 
directors' remuneration and transactions specified by law are not made.
 Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Ryanair Holdings plc (continued)
 Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit (continued)
 5              Our conclusions on other matters on which we are required to report by the Companies Acts, 
1963 to 2013 are set out below
 We have obtained all the information and explanations which we consider necessary for the purposes of our 
audit.
 The Company statement of financial position is in agreement with the books of account and, in our 
opinion, proper books of account have been kept by the Company.
 In our opinion the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with the financial statements 
and the description in the Corporate Governance Statement of the main features of the internal control and 
risk management systems in relation to the process for preparing the Group financial statements is 
consistent with the Group financial statements.
 The net assets of the Company, as stated in the Company balance sheet are more than half of the amount of 
its called-up share capital and, in our opinion, on that basis there did not exist at 31 March 2014 a 
financial situation which under Section 40(1) of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983 would require the 
convening of an extraordinary general meeting of the Company.
 Basis of our report, responsibilities and restrictions on use
 As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement set out on page 30, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group and Company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
 An audit undertaken in accordance with ISAs (UK and Ireland) involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's circumstances and have 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -12-
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
 In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Reportto identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in 
the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
 Whilst an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK and Ireland) is designed to provide reasonable 
assurance of identifying material misstatements or omissions it is not guaranteed to do so. Rather the 
auditor plans the audit to determine the extent of testing needed to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements does not exceed materiality 
for the financial statements as a whole. This testing requires us to conduct significant audit work on a 
broad range of assets, liabilities, income and expense as well as devoting significant time of the most 
experienced members of the audit team, in particular the engagement partner responsible for the audit, to 
subjective areas of accounting and reporting.
 Our report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with section 193 of the 
Companies Act 1990. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.

Body
 The Company Faces Risks Related to its Internet Reservations Operations and its Announced Elimination of 
Airport Check-in Facilities. Over 99% of Ryanair's flight reservations are made through its website. Although 
Ryanair has established a contingency program whereby the website is hosted in three separate locations, each of 
these locations accesses the same booking engine, located at a single center, in order to make reservations.
 A back-up booking engine is available to Ryanair to support its existing platform in the event of a breakdown in this 
facility. Nonetheless, the process of switching over to the back-up engine could take some time and there can be no 
assurance that Ryanair would not suffer a significant loss of reservations in the event of a major breakdown of its 
booking engine or other related systems, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on Ryanair's operating 
results or financial condition.
 Since October 1, 2009, all passengers have been required to use Internet check-in. Internet check-in is part of a 
package of measures intended to reduce check-in lines and passenger handling costs and pass on these savings 
by reducing passenger airfares. Ryanair has deployed this system across its network. Any disruptions to the 
Internet check-in service as a result of a breakdown in the relevant computer systems or otherwise could have a 
material adverse impact on these service-improvement and cost-reduction efforts. There can be no assurance, 
however, that this process will continue to be successful or that consumers will not switch to other carriers that 
provide standard check-in facilities, which would negatively affect Ryanair's results of operations and financial 
condition.
 The Company Faces Risks Related to Unauthorized Use of Information from the Company's Website. 
Screenscraper websites gain unauthorized access to Ryanair's website and booking system, extract flight and 
pricing information and display it on their own websites for sale to customers at prices which may include hidden 
intermediary fees on top of Ryanair's fares. Ryanair does not allow any such commercial use of its website and 
objects to the practice of screenscraping also on the basis of certain legal principles, such as database rights, 
copyright protection, etc. Ryanair is involved in a number of legal proceedings against the proprietors of 
screenscraper websites in Ireland, Germany, The Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy and Switzerland. Ryanair's 
objective is to prevent any unauthorized use of its website. Ryanair does allow certain companies who operate fare 
comparison (i.e. not reselling) websites to access its schedule and fare information for the purposes of fare 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -21-
comparison provided they sign a license and use the agreed method to access the data. Ryanair also permits 
Travelport (trading as Galileo and Worldspan, a GDS operator) to provide access to Ryanair's fares to traditional 
travel agencies. Ryanair has received favourable rulings in Ireland, Germany and The Netherlands, and 
unfavorable rulings in Spain, France and Italy, in its actions against screenscrapers. However, pending the outcome 
of these legal proceedings and if Ryanair were to be ultimately unsuccessful in them, the activities of screenscraper 
websites could lead to a reduction in the number of customers who book directly on Ryanair's website and 
consequently to a reduction in Ryanair's ancillary revenue stream. Also, some customers may be lost to Ryanair 
once they are presented by a screenscraper website with a Ryanair fare inflated by the screenscraper's 
intermediary fee. This could also adversely affect Ryanair's reputation as a low-fares airline, which could negatively 
affect Ryanair's results of operations and financial condition.
 For additional details, see "Item 8. Financial Information-Other Financial Information-Legal Proceedings-Legal 
Proceedings Against Internet Ticket Touts."
 Ryanair is Subject To Cyber Security Risks And May Incur Increasing Costs In An Effort To Minimise Those Risks. 
As almost all of Ryanair's reservations are made through its website, security breaches could expose it to a risk of 
loss or misuse of customer information, litigation and potential liability. Although Ryanair takes steps to secure its 
website and management information systems, the security measures it has implemented may not be effective, and 
its systems may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and 
events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, cyber attacks, computer viruses, power loss, or other 
disruptive events. Ryanair may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly 
evolving types of cyber attacks. Attacks may be targeted at Ryanair, its customers and suppliers, or others who 
have entrusted it with information.
 In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breaches by 
Ryanair or by persons with whom it has commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal 
or confidential information. Any such cyber attack or other security issue could result in a significant loss of 
reservations and customer confidence in the website and its business which, in turn, could have a material adverse 
effect on Ryanair's operating results or financial condition and potentially entail its incurring significant litigation or 
other costs.
 The Irish Corporation Tax Rate Could Rise. The majority of Ryanair's profits are subject to Irish corporation tax at a 
statutory rate of 12.5%. Due to the size and scale of the Irish government's budgetary deficit and although Ireland 
has exited the "bailout" which was funded by a combination of loans from the International Monetary Fund and the 
European Union, there remains a risk that the Irish government could increase Irish corporation tax rates above 
12.5% in order to repay current or future loans or to increase tax revenues.
 At 12.5%, the rate of Irish corporation tax is lower than that applied by most of the other European Union member 
states, and has periodically been subject to critical comment by the governments of other EU member states. 
Although the Irish government has repeatedly publicly stated that it will not increase corporation tax rates, there can 
be no assurance that such an increase in corporation tax rates will not occur.
 In the event that the Irish government increases corporation tax rates or changes the basis of calculation of 
corporation tax from the present basis, any such changes would result in the Company paying higher corporate 
taxes and would have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial position and results of operations.
 Change in EU Regulations in Relation to Employers and Employee Social Insurance Could Increase Costs. The 
European Parliament passed legislation governing the payment of employee and employer social insurance costs 
in May 2012. The legislation was introduced in late June 2012. The legislation governs the country in which 
employees and employers must pay social insurance costs. Prior to June 2012, Ryanair paid employee and 
employer social insurance in the country under whose laws the employee's contract of employment is governed, 
which is either the U.K. or Ireland. Under the terms of this new legislation, employees and employers must pay 
social insurance in the country where the employee is based. The legislation includes grandfathering rights which 
means that existing employees (i.e. those employed prior to the introduction of the new legislation in June 2012) 
should be exempt from the effects of this legislation for a period of 10 years up until 2022. However, both new and 
existing employees who transfer from their present base location to a new base in another EU country may be 
impacted by the new rules in relation to employee and employer contributions. Each country within the EU has 
different rules and rates in relation to the calculation of employee and employer social insurance contributions. 
Ryanair estimates that the change in legislation will not have any initial material impact on its salary costs although 
it will have an adverse impact over time in the majority of jurisdictions in which Ryanair currently operates from.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -21-
 Ryanair is Subject to Tax Audits. The Company operates in many jurisdictions and is, from time to time, subject to 
tax audits, which by their nature are often complex and can require several years to conclude. While the Company 
is of the view that it is tax compliant in the various jurisdictions in which it operates, there can be no guarantee, 
particularly in the current economic environment, that it will not receive tax assessments following the conclusion of 
the tax audits.  If assessed, the Company will robustly defend its position.  In the event that the Company is 
unsuccessful in defending its position, it is possible that the effective tax rate, employment and other costs of the 
Company could materially increase. See "-The Irish Corporation Tax Rate Could Rise" above.
 Risks Associated with the Euro. The Company is headquartered in Ireland and its reporting currency is the euro. 
As a result of the ongoing uncertainty arising from the Eurozone debt crisis, in 2012 there was widespread 
speculation regarding the future of the Eurozone, including with regard to Ireland, the country in which the Company 
is headquartered. Although the economic environment in Ireland has considerably improved, there is still a risk of 
contagion spreading to the weaker Eurozone members. To date, however, there have been no exits from the 
Eurozone. Ryanair predominantly operates to/from countries within the Eurozone and has significant operational 
and financial exposures to the Eurozone that could result in a reduction in the operating performance of Ryanair or 
the devaluation of certain assets. Ryanair has taken certain risk management measures to minimize any 
disruptions, however these risk management measures may be insufficient.

Chairman's Report
 Dear Shareholders,
 This year we delivered a net profit after tax of EUR523m which was a disappointing EUR46m decline 
compared to last year's profit of EUR569m.  However, this decline was entirely due to a 4% fall in fares, 
weaker sterling, and significantly higher fuel costs which rose by EUR128m.
 During the year Ryanair delivered a number of significant milestones:
 --      Our traffic grew by 3% to 81.7m passengers.
 --      We ordered 180 new aircraft from Boeing for delivery from 2014 to 2018.
 --      We opened 8 new bases and 121 new routes.
 --      We completed a EUR482m share buyback.
 --      We successfully improved customer service via the launch of a new website and introduced 
allocated seating.
 --      We achieved a BBB+ (stable) rating from Standard & Poor's ("S&P") and Fitch and became the 
highest rated airline in the world.
 During fiscal 2014 we suffered a EUR128m increase in our fuel bill, which accounts for 46% of our total 
operating costs.  Looking forward we are 90% hedged for fiscal 2015 at approximately $96 per barrel, 
significantly below current fuel prices, which will deliver approximately EUR50m cost savings this year.  
We have also extended our hedging into H1 FY16 and are already 55% hedged at prices which are just under 
4% lower per passenger than fiscal 2015.
 We lead the airline industry by having the lowest fares, the most on- time flights, and the youngest 
fleet. This year we have focused on significantly improving our customer experience by launching a new 
website, a user friendly mobile app, the My Ryanair registration service which makes it simpler, and 
easier for customers to book Ryanair flights.  We have recently introduced allocated seating, reduced 
certain fees and charges, launched a family product with discounts for children, and enabled passengers to 
take a 2(nd) small carry-on bag on-board.  These improvements have been warmly welcomed by our customers, 
and we will launch further enhancements as part of our "always getting better" customer experience 
programme.
 The earlier release of our seasonal schedules and selling these seats at lower fares will deliver a 3% 
increase in load factors to 86% this year.  This stronger forward booking strategy is helping us to better 
manage our close-in fares.  We have also made significant changes in the way we market and distribute our 
flights.  In the spring we launched an extensive TV and outdoor advertising campaign in key EU markets and 
will initiate a series of campaigns this winter to promote our new website, mobile app and the ongoing 
improvements to customer service.  In April we commenced distributing Ryanair flights on the GDS's (Global 
Distribution Systems) used by business customers and on Google flight search. In September we will launch 
our new business service which will include a same day flight change and other attractive features for 
business customers such as fast track through security at many Ryanair airports.  We will continue to 
expand our distribution to enable more business customers to book Ryanair flights.
 In 2013 we announced plans to return up to EUR1bn to shareholders via share buybacks and special 
dividends by the end of fiscal 2015.  We have already completed EUR482m share buybacks and the Board have 
now proposed a dividend in Q4 of EUR0.37 per share a 10% increase on the 2013 special dividend which 
amounts to approximately EUR520m subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting.  The 
combination of this third special dividend (subject to AGM approval) and previous share buybacks and 
dividends will mean that Ryanair has returned over EUR2.53bn to shareholders over the past 6 years.
 We continue to see tremendous opportunities to grow our business as many of Europe's legacy and regional 
carriers restructure and cut capacity.  As the first of our new aircraft delivers this September we look 
forward to continuing to grow the airline to carry over 110m passengers by 2019.
 Our BBB+ (stable) rating by S&P and Fitch makes us the highest rated airline in the world.  This rating 
combined with the strength of our Balance Sheet with EUR3.2bn in cash at the end of fiscal 2014 enabled us 
to issue our first unsecured eurobond in June for EUR850m at a coupon of just 1.875%.  This new source of 
attractively priced financing will form part of our strategy to fund our future growth as we purchase 180 
aircraft over the coming years.
 I would like to warmly welcome a new director Michael Cawley, who joins the board in August and will 
stand for election by the shareholders at the AGM in September, 2014.  I have also invited Howard Millar 
to join the board in July 2015, 6 months after he steps down as CFO in December 2014.

 Ryanair's Policy on Noise and Emissions. Ryanair is committed to reducing emissions and noise through 
investments in "next generation" aircraft and engine technologies and the implementation of certain 
operational and commercial decisions to minimize the environmental impact of its operations. According to 
the Air Travel Carbon and Energy Efficiency Report published by Brighter Planet, Ryanair is the industry 
leader in terms of environmental efficiency, and the Company is constantly working towards improving its 
performance.
 In December 2005, Ryanair completed the fleet replacement program it commenced in 1999. All of Ryanair's 
older Boeing 737-200A aircraft were replaced with Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, and Ryanair 
now operates a single-aircraft-type fleet of Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft with an average age 
of just over 5.5 years. The design of the new aircraft is aimed at minimizing drag, thereby reducing the 
rate of fuel burn and noise levels. The engines are also quieter and more fuel-efficient. Furthermore, by 
moving to an all Boeing 737-800 "next generation" fleet, Ryanair reduced the unit emissions per passenger 
due to the inherent capacity increase in the Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The Boeing 737-800 "next generation" 
aircraft have a significantly superior fuel-burn to passenger-kilometer ratio than Ryanair's former fleet 
of Boeing 737-200A aircraft. See "-Aircraft" above for details on Ryanair's fleet plan.
 Ryanair has also installed winglets on all of its existing aircraft and all future aircraft will also be 
fitted with winglets. Winglets reduce both the rate of fuel burn and carbon dioxide emissions by 
approximately 4% and also reduce noise emissions.
 In addition, Ryanair has distinctive operational characteristics that management believes are helpful to 
the general environment. In particular, Ryanair:
 --      operates with a high-seat density of 189 seats and an all-economy configuration, as opposed to 
the 162 seats and two-class configuration of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft used by traditional network 
airlines, reducing fuel burn and emissions per seat-kilometer flown;
 --      has reduced per-passenger emissions through higher load factors;
 --      better utilizes existing infrastructure by operating out of underutilized secondary and regional 
airports throughout Europe, which limits the use of holding patterns and taxiing times, thus reducing fuel 
burn and emissions and reducing the need for new airport infrastructure;
 --      provides direct services as opposed to connecting flights, in order to limit the need for 
passengers to transfer at main hubs and thus reduces the number of take-offs and landings per journey from 
four to two, reducing fuel burn and emissions per journey;
 --      has no late-night departures of aircraft, reducing the impact of noise emissions; and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -34-
 --      is currently evaluating the benefits of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, a variant of the 737, with 
new more fuel-efficient engines.
 Emissions Trading. On November 19, 2008, the European Council of Ministers adopted legislation to add 
aviation to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme as of 2012. This scheme, which has thus far applied mainly to 
energy producers, is a cap-and-trade system for CO(2) emissions to encourage industries to improve their 
CO(2) efficiency. Under the legislation, airlines were granted initial CO(2) allowances based on 
historical "revenue ton kilometers" and a CO(2) efficiency benchmark. Any shortage of allowances has to be 
purchased in the open market and/or at government auctions. Management believes that this legislation is 
likely to have a negative impact on the European airline industry. Ryanair takes its environmental 
responsibilities seriously and intends to continue to improve its environmental efficiency and to minimize 
emissions. Under Regulation 7 of The UK Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors' Report) 
Regulations 2013, Ryanair is obliged to state its annual quantity of emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent. Ryanair's EU Emissions Trading Scheme monitoring, reporting and allowance surrender 
obligations are mandated on a calendar year basis. For calendar year 2013, Ryanair emitted 7,649,120 tCO2, 
which equates to 0.094 tCO2 per passenger.
 Aviation Taxes. Ryanair is fundamentally opposed to the introduction of any aviation taxes, including any 
environmental taxes, fuel taxes or emissions levies. Ryanair has and continues to offer the lowest fares 
in Europe, to make passenger air travel affordable and accessible to European consumers. Ryanair believes 
that the imposition of additional taxes on airlines will not only increase airfares, but will discourage 
new entrants into the market, resulting in less choice for consumers. Ryanair believes this would 
ultimately have adverse effects on the European economy in general. There is in particular no 
justification for any environmental taxes on aviation following the introduction of the Emissions Trading 
Scheme for airlines.
 As a company, Ryanair believes in free market competition and that the imposition of aviation taxation 
would favor the less efficient flag carriers - which generally have smaller and older aircraft, lower load 
factors, and a much higher fuel burn per passenger, and which operate primarily into congested airports - 
and reduce competition. Furthermore, the introduction of a tax at a European level only would distort 
competition between airlines operating solely within Europe and those operating also outside of Europe. We 
believe that the introduction of such a tax would also be incompatible with international law.
 Airport charges
 The EU Airport Charges Directive of March 2009 sets forth general principles that are to be followed by 
airports with more than five million passenger per annum, and all capital city airports irrespective of 
their passenger throughput, when setting airport charges, and provides for an appeals procedure for 
airlines in the event they are not satisfied with the level of charges. However, Ryanair does not believe 
that this procedure will be effective or that it will constrain those airports that are currently abusing 
their dominant position, in part because the legislation was mis-transposed in certain countries, such as 
Ireland and Spain, so as to deprive airlines of even the basic safeguards provided for in the Directive. 
This legislation may in fact lead to higher airport charges, depending on how its provisions are applied 
by EU member states and subsequently by the courts.
 Slots
 Currently, the majority of Ryanair's bases of operations have no "slot" allocation restrictions; however, 
traffic at a substantial number of the airports Ryanair serves, including its primary bases are regulated 
by means of "slot" allocations, which represent authorizations to take off or land at a particular airport 
within a specified time period. In addition, EU law currently regulates the acquisition, transfer, and 
loss of slots. Applicable EU regulations currently prohibit the buying or selling of slots for cash. The 
European Commission adopted a regulation in April 2004 (Regulation (EC) No. 793/2004) that made some minor 
amendments to the current allocation system, allowing for limited transfers of, but not trading in, slots. 
Slots may be transferred from one route to another by the same carrier, transferred within a group or as 
part of a change of control of a carrier, or swapped between carriers. In April 2008, the European 
Commission issued a communication on the application of the slot allocation regulation, signaling the 
acceptance of secondary trading of airport slots between airlines. This is expected to allow more 
flexibility and mobility in the use of slots and will further enhance possibilities for market entry at 
slot constrained airports. Any future legislation that might create an official secondary market for slots 
could create a potential source of revenue for certain of Ryanair's current and potential competitors, 
many of which have many more slots allocated at primary airports at present than Ryanair. The European 
Commission proposed a revision to the slots legislation reflecting the principle of secondary trading, 
which is currently being negotiated by the EU institutions, and will not be finalized before the middle of 
2014. Slot values depend on several factors, including the airport, time of day covered, the availability 
of slots and the class of aircraft. Ryanair's ability to gain access to and develop its operations at 
slot-controlled airports will be affected by the availability of slots for takeoffs and landings at these 
specific airports. New entrants to an airport are currently given certain privileges in terms of obtaining 
slots, but such privileges are subject to the grandfathered rights of existing operators that are 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -34-
utilizing their slots. There is no assurance that Ryanair will be able to obtain a sufficient number of 
slots at the slot-controlled airports that it desires to serve in the future at the time it needs them or 
on acceptable terms.
 Other
 Health and occupational safety issues relating to the Company are largely addressed in Ireland by the 
Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 and other regulations under that act. Although licenses or 
permits are not issued under such legislation, compliance is monitored by the Health and Safety Authority 
(the "Authority"), which is the regulating body in this area. The Authority periodically reviews Ryanair's 
health and safety record and when appropriate, issues improvement notices or prohibition notices. Ryanair 
has responded to all such notices to the satisfaction of the Authority. Other safety issues are covered by 
the Irish Aviation Orders, which may vary from time to time.

Body
 The Company financial statements are presented in euro millions, being its functional currency. They are 
prepared on an historical cost basis except for certain share based payment transactions, which are based 
on fair values determined at grant date.
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to makejudgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses.  These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of 
which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. These 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period 
of the revision and future periods if these are also affected. Principal sources of estimation uncertainty 
have been set out in the critical accounting policy section in Note 1 to the consolidated financial 
statements. Such uncertainties may impact the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries at future 
dates.
 Statement of compliance
 The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.  In 
addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRS as adopted by the EU,  the Company 
financial statements comply with IFRS as issued by the IASB.  The Company financial statements have also 
been prepared in accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2013.
 The directors have reviewed all new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations, effective for 
future financial years,  as set forth in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, and have 
concluded their adoption will not have a significant impact on the parent entity financial statements.
 Share-based payments
 The Company accounts for the fair value of share options granted to employees of a subsidiary as an 
increase in its investment in that subsidiary. The fair value of such options is determined in a 
consistent manner to that set out in the Group share-based payment accounting policy and as set out in 
Note 15 (c) to the consolidated financial statements.
 Income taxes
 Income taxes are accounted for by the Company in a manner consistent to that set out in the Group income 
tax accounting policy.
 Financial assets
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -95-
 The Company holds investments in subsidiary companies, which are carried at cost less any impairments.
 Guarantees
 The Company occasionally guarantees certain liabilities of subsidiary companies. These are considered to 
be insurance arrangements and are accounted for as such i.e. a contingent liability until such time as it 
becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. Additional 
details are provided in Note 34 to the company financial statements.
 Loans and borrowings
 All loans and borrowings are initially recorded at the fair value of consideration received, net of 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-current interest bearing loans are 
measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest yield methodology.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -95-
At March 31, 2014, Ryanair Holdings plc had borrowings of EUR35.2 million (2013: EUR35.2 million; 2012: 
EUR35.2 million) from Ryanair Limited. The loan is interest free and repayable on demand.
 33    Financial instruments
 The Company does not undertake hedging activities on behalf of itself or other companies within the 
Group. Financial instruments in the Company primarily take the form of loans to subsidiary undertakings.
 Amounts due to or from subsidiary undertakings (primarily Ryanair Limited) in the form of inter-company 
loans are interest free and are repayable upon demand and further details of these have been given in 
Notes 31 and 32 of the parent entity financial statements. These inter-company balances are eliminated in 
the group consolidation.
 The euro is the functional and presentation currency of the Company's balance sheet and all transactions 
entered into by the Company are euro denominated. As such, the Company does not have any significant 
foreign currency risk.
 The credit risk associated with the Company's financial assets principally relates to the credit risk of 
the Ryanair group as a whole. During the year ended March 31, 2014, Ryanair received a BBB+ (stable) 
credit rating from Standard and Poor's and in June 2014, Fitch Ratings also issued a similar credit rating 
on the Company. Additionally the Company had guaranteed certain of its subsidiary company liabilities. 
Details of these arrangements are given in Note 34 to the company financial statements.
 34    Contingencies
 a) The Company has provided EUR4,803.4 million (2013: EUR5,973.6 million; 2012: EUR5,503.4 million) in 
letters of guarantee to secure obligations of subsidiary undertakings in respect of loans, bank advances 
and long dated foreign currency transactions.
 b)  In order to avail itself of the exemption contained in Section 17 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 
1986, the holding company, Ryanair Holdings plc, has guaranteed the liabilities of its subsidiary 
undertakings registered in Ireland. As a result, the subsidiary undertakings have been exempted from the 
provisions of Section 7 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986. Details of the Group's principal 
subsidiaries have been included at Note 27. The Irish subsidiaries of the Group covered by the Section 17 
exemption are listed at Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements also. Eight additional Irish 
subsidiaries covered by this exemption, which are not listed as principal subsidiaries at Note 27 to the 
consolidated financial statements, are Airport Marketing Services Limited, FRC Investments Limited, 
Coinside Limited and Mazine Limited.

 susceptibility to price discounting. See "Risks Related to the Company-The Company Faces Significant Price and 
Other Pressures in a Highly Competitive Environment" above.
 Safety-Related Undertakings Could Affect the Company's Results. Aviation authorities in Europe and the United 
States periodically require or suggest that airlines implement certain safety-related procedures on their aircraft. In 
recent years, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (the "FAA") has required a number of such procedures with 
regard to Boeing 737-800 aircraft, including checks of rear pressure bulkheads and flight control modules, redesign 
of the rudder control system, and limitations on certain operating procedures. Ryanair's policy is to implement any 
such required procedures in accordance with FAA guidance and to perform such procedures in close collaboration 
with Boeing. To date, all such procedures have been conducted as part of Ryanair's standard maintenance 
programme and have not interrupted flight schedules nor required any material increases in Ryanair's maintenance 
expenses. However, there can be no assurance that the FAA or other regulatory authorities will not recommend or 
require other safety-related undertakings or that such undertakings would not adversely impact Ryanair's operating 
results or financial condition.
 There also can be no assurance that new regulations will not be implemented in the future that would apply to 
Ryanair's aircraft and result in an increase in Ryanair's cost of maintenance or other costs beyond management's 
current estimates. In addition, should Ryanair's aircraft cease to be sufficiently reliable or should any public 
perception develop that Ryanair's aircraft are less than completely reliable, Ryanair's business could be materially 
adversely affected.
 Risks Related to Ownership of the Company's Ordinary Shares or ADRs
 EU Rules Impose Restrictions on the Ownership of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals, and 
the Company Has Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals. EU Regulation No. 
1008/2008 requires that, in order to obtain and retain an operating license, an EU air carrier must be majority-
owned and effectively controlled by EU nationals. The regulation does not specify what level of share ownership will 
confer effective control on a holder or holders of Ordinary Shares. The Board of Directors of Ryanair Holdings is 
given certain powers under Ryanair Holdings' articles of association (the "Articles") to take action to ensure that the 
number of Ordinary Shares held in Ryanair Holdings by non-EU nationals ("Affected Shares") does not reach a 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -24-
level that could jeopardize the Company's entitlement to continue to hold or enjoy the benefit of any license, permit, 
consent, or privilege which it holds or enjoys and which enables it to carry on business as an air carrier. The 
directors, from time to time, set a "Permitted Maximum" on the number of the Company's Ordinary Shares that may 
be owned by non-EU nationals at such level as they believe will comply with EU law. The Permitted Maximum is 
currently set at 49.9%. In addition, under certain circumstances, the directors can take action to safeguard the 
Company's ability to operate by identifying those Ordinary Shares, American Depositary Shares ("ADSs") or 
Affected Shares which give rise to the need to take action and treat such Ordinary Shares, the American Depositary 
Receipts ("ADRs") evidencing such ADSs, or Affected Shares as "Restricted Shares." The Board of Directors may, 
under certain circumstances, deprive holders of Restricted Shares of their rights to attend, vote at, and speak at 
general meetings, and/or require such holders to dispose of their Restricted Shares to an EU national within as little 
as 21 days. The directors are also given the power to transfer such Restricted Shares themselves if a holder fails to 
comply. In 2002, the Company implemented measures to restrict the ability of non-EU nationals to purchase 
Ordinary Shares, and non-EU nationals are currently effectively barred from purchasing Ordinary Shares, and will 
remain so for as long as these restrictions remain in place. There can be no assurance that these restrictions will 
ever be lifted. Additionally, these foreign ownership restrictions could result in Ryanair's exclusion from certain stock 
tracking indices. Any such exclusion may adversely affect the market price of the Ordinary Shares and ADRs. On 
April 19, 2012, the Company obtained shareholder approval to repurchase ADRs as part of its general authority to 
repurchase up to 5% of the issued share capital in the Company. During fiscal 2014, the Company repurchased 
6,018,800 ADRs equivalent to 30,094,000 ordinary shares at a price of $49.01 per ADR, equivalent to 
approximately EUR7.41 per ordinary share. See "Item 10. Additional Information-Limitations on Share Ownership 
by Non-EU Nationals" for a detailed discussion of restrictions on share ownership and the current ban on share 
purchases by non-EU nationals.
 As of June 30, 2014, EU nationals owned at least 52.8% of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares (assuming 
conversion of all outstanding ADRs into Ordinary Shares).
 Holders of Ordinary Shares are Currently Unable to Convert those Shares into American Depositary Receipts. In 
an effort to increase the percentage of its share capital held by EU nationals, on June 26, 2001, Ryanair Holdings 
instructed The Bank of New York Mellon, the depositary for its ADR program (the "Depositary"), to suspend the 
issuance of new ADRs in exchange for the deposit of Ordinary Shares until further notice. Holders of Ordinary 
Shares cannot convert their Ordinary Shares into ADRs during this suspension, and there can be no assurance that 
the suspension will ever be lifted. See also "-EU Rules Impose Restrictions on the Ownership of Ryanair Holdings' 
Ordinary Shares by Non-EU nationals and the Company has Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of Ordinary Shares 
by Non-EU Nationals" above.
 The Company's Results of Operations May Fluctuate Significantly. The Company's results of operations have 
varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. See "Item 5. 
Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Seasonal Fluctuations." Among the factors causing these variations 
are the airline industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions, the seasonal nature of air travel, and trends in 
airlines' costs, especially fuel costs. Because a substantial portion of airline travel (both business and personal) is 
discretionary, the industry tends to experience adverse financial results during general economic downturns. The 
Company is substantially dependent on discretionary air travel.
 The trading price of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares and ADRs may be subject to wide fluctuations in response 
to quarterly variations in the Company's operating results and the operating results of other airlines. In addition, the 
global stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market 
prices of many airline company stocks. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of 
the Ordinary Shares and ADRs.
 Ryanair Holdings May or May Not Pay Dividends. Since its incorporation as the holding company for Ryanair in 
1996, Ryanair Holdings has only occasionally declared special dividends on both its Ordinary Shares and ADRs. 
The directors of the Company declared on June 1, 2010 that Ryanair Holdings intended to pay a special dividend of 
approximately EUR500 million, and following shareholder approval at its annual general meeting on September 22, 
2010 this special dividend was paid on October 1, 2010. Directors of the Company also declared on May 21, 2012 
that Ryanair Holdings intended to pay a special dividend of EUR0.34 per ordinary share (approx. EUR492 million) 
and following shareholder approval at the annual general meeting on September 21, 2012 this special dividend was 
paid on November 30, 2012. The Company may pay other dividends from time to time. In June 2013, the Company 
detailed plans to return up to EUR1 billion to shareholders over the next two years. The Company completed 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -24-
EUR481.7 million in share buybacks in the fiscal year 2014 (including just over 6.0 million ADR buybacks) and 
indicated on May 19, 2014 that it plans to pay a special dividend of up to approximately EUR520 million in the fourth 
quarter of fiscal year 2015, subject to shareholder approval at its annual general meeting on September 25, 2014. 
The Company has made no further commitments in relation to the payment of dividends, share buybacks or other 
shareholder distributions. See "Item 8. Financial Information-Other Financial Information-Dividend Policy." As a 
holding company, Ryanair Holdings does not have any material assets other than the shares of Ryanair.
 Increased Costs for Possible Future ADR and Share Repurchases. In April 2012, the Company held an 
extraordinary general meeting ("EGM") to authorize the directors to repurchase Ordinary Shares and ADRs for up 
to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ").  Up until April 
2012, shareholders had only authorized the directors to repurchase Ordinary Shares. As the ADRs typically trade at 
a premium of 15% to 20% compared to Ordinary Shares, this may result in increased costs in performing share 
buy-backs in the future. In fiscal 2014, the Company bought back 6,018,800 ADRs for cancellation, which is 
equivalent to 30,094,000 Ordinary Shares, as part of its overall share buyback during fiscal year 2014 of 69.5 
million Ordinary Shares. On June 20, 2013 the Company detailed plans to return up to EUR1 billion to shareholders 
over the next two years. The Company completed EUR481.7 million in share buybacks in the fiscal year 2014. On 
May 19, 2014 the Company indicated that it plans to pay a special dividend of up to approximately EUR520 million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, subject to shareholder approval at its annual general meeting on 
September 25, 2014. However, there can be no

  consequently the BAA should proceed to dispose of London (Stansted) and one of the Scottish airports. The BAA 
appealed this decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, and lost on February 1, 2012. The BAA then brought a 
further appeal to the Court of Appeal, which they also lost on July 26, 2012. While these appeals were ongoing, the 
BAA proceeded to sell Edinburgh airport in April 2012. BAA did not appeal the Court of Appeal judgment to the UK 
Supreme Court, and proceeded to complete the sale of London (Stansted) airport to Manchester Airports Group plc 
in March 2013.
 With respect to Dublin airport, Ryanair appealed the December 2009 decision of the CAR, which set maximum 
charges at the airport for 2010 through 2014, to the Appeals Panel set up by the Minister for Transport. In June 
2010, the Appeals Panel found in favor of Ryanair on the matter of differential pricing between Terminal 1 and 
Terminal 2, recommending that such differential pricing be imposed by the CAR. The CAR subsequently overruled 
the decision of the Appeals Panel and allowed the charges increase at Dublin Airport, with no differential pricing 
between Terminals 1 and 2.
 Ryanair has also been trying to prevent both the BAA in London and the DAA in Dublin from engaging in wasteful 
capital expenditure. In the case of London (Stansted) Airport, the BAA was planning to spend GBP4 billion on a 
second runway and terminal, which Ryanair believes should only cost approximately GBP1 billion. Following the 
final decision of the Competition Commission forcing BAA to sell London (Stansted) airport, Ryanair believed that it 
was highly unlikely that BAA's planned GBP4 billion plans would proceed. The Liberal/Conservative government in 
the U.K. had also outlined that it would not approve the building of any more runways in the Southeast of England. 
Consequently, in May 2010, the BAA announced that it would not pursue its plans to develop a second runway at 
London (Stansted).
 In the case of Dublin, the DAA has built a second terminal, costing over four times its initial estimate. When the 
DAA first announced plans to build a second terminal ("Terminal 2") at Dublin Airport, it estimated that the proposed 
expansion would cost between EUR170 million and EUR200 million. Ryanair supported a development of this 
scale; however, in September 2006, the DAA announced that the construction of Terminal 2 would cost 
approximately EUR800 million. Subsequently, the cost of the new infrastructure rose in excess of EUR1.2 billion. 
Ryanair opposed expansion at what it believed to be an excessive cost. On August 29, 2007, however the relevant 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -51-
planning authority approved the planning application from the DAA for the building of Terminal 2, and other 
facilities, all of which went ahead. On May 1, 2010, the airport fees per departing passenger increased by 27% from 
EUR13.61 to EUR17.23, and by a further 12% in 2011 following the opening of Terminal 2 in November 2010 in 
accordance with the CAR's decision of December 4, 2009 in relation to airport charges between 2010 and 2014. 
Ryanair sought a judicial review of the planning approval, however, this appeal was unsuccessful. The increase in 
charges, in combination with the introduction of the EUR10 Air Travel Tax (subsequently reduced to EUR3 in March 
2011 and eliminated entirely in April 2014) mentioned above, led to substantially reduced passenger volumes to 
and from Dublin Airport.  See "Item 3. Risk Factors 3/4 Risks Related to the Company 3/4 Ryanair's Continued 
Growth is Dependent on Access to Suitable Airports; Charges for Airport Access are Subject to Increase" and "-The 
Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports," as well as "Item 4. Information on 
the Company-Airport Operations-Airport Charges."
 Legal Proceedings Against Internet Ticket Touts. The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings 
against internet ticket touts (screenscraper websites) in Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy and 
Switzerland. Screenscraper websites gain unauthorized access to Ryanair's website and booking system, extract 
flight and pricing information and display it on their own websites for sale to customers at prices which include 
intermediary fees on top of Ryanair's fares. Ryanair does not allow any such commercial use of its website and 
objects to the practice of screenscraping also on the basis of certain legal principles, such as database rights, 
copyright protection, etc. The Company's objective is to prevent any unauthorized use of its website. The Company 
also believes that the selling of airline tickets by screenscraper websites is inherently anti-consumer as it inflates 
the cost of air travel. At the same time, Ryanair encourages genuine price comparison websites which allow 
consumers to compare prices of several airlines and then refer consumers to the airline website in order to perform 
the booking at the original fare. Ryanair offers licensed access to its flight and pricing information to such websites. 
Ryanair also permits Travelport, a GDS operator, to provide access to Ryanair's fares to traditional bricks and 
mortar travel agencies. The Company has received favorable rulings in Ireland, Germany and The Netherlands, and 
unfavorable rulings in Spain, France and Italy. However, pending the outcome of these legal proceedings and if 
Ryanair were to be ultimately unsuccessful in them, the activities of screenscraper websites could lead to a 
reduction in the number of customers who book directly on Ryanair's website and loss of ancillary revenues which 
are an important source of profitability through the sale of car hire, hotels and travel insurance etc. Also, some 
customers may be lost to the Company once they are presented by a screenscraper website with a Ryanair fare 
inflated by the screenscraper's intermediary fee. See Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the 
Company-Ryanair Faces Risks Related to Unauthorized Use of Information from the Company's Website."
 Dividend Policy
 Following shareholder approval at the September 2010 annual general meeting of shareholders, a EUR500 million 
special dividend was paid in October 2010.  Similarly, following shareholder approval at the September 2012 annual 
general meeting of shareholders, a dividend of EUR0.34 per Ordinary Share (approximately EUR492 million) was 
paid in November 2012.  The Company may pay other dividends from time to time. On June 20, 2013 the Company 
detailed plans to return up to EUR1 billion to shareholders over the next two years. The Company completed 
EUR481.7 million in share buybacks in fiscal year 2014 and indicated on May 19, 2014 that it plans to pay a special 
dividend of up to approximately EUR520 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, subject to shareholder 
approval at its annual general meeting on September 25, 2014. The Company has made no further commitments in 
relation to the payment of dividends, share buybacks or other shareholder distributions. Any cash dividends or other 
distributions, if made, are expected to be made in euro, although Ryanair Holdings' Articles provide that dividends 
may be declared and paid in U.S. dollars. In the case of ADRs, the Depositary will convert all cash dividends and 
other distributions payable to owners of ADRs into U.S. dollars to the extent that, in its judgment, it can do so on a 
reasonable basis, and will distribute the resulting U.S. dollar amounts (net of conversion expenses and any 
applicable fees) to the owners of ADRs. See "Item 12. Description of Securities Other than Equity Securities" for 
information regarding fees of the Depositary.
 Share Buy-back Program
 Following shareholder approval at the 2006 annual general meeting of shareholders, a EUR300 million share buy-
back program was formally announced on June 5, 2007. Permission was received at the annual general meeting of 
the shareholders held on September 20, 2007 to repurchase a maximum of 75.6 million Ordinary Shares 
representing 5% of the Company's then outstanding share capital. The EUR300 million share buy-back of 
approximately 59.5 million Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 3.8% of the Company's pre-existing share 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -51-
capital, was completed in November 2007. In February 2008, the Company announced a second share buy-back 
program of up to EUR200 million worth of Ordinary Shares, which was ratified by shareholders at the annual 
general meeting of the shareholders held on September 18, 2008. 18.1 million Ordinary Shares were repurchased 
under this program at a cost of approximately EUR46.0 million. The Company also completed share buy-backs of 
EUR125 million in respect of 36.5 million Ordinary Shares in the 2012 fiscal year and 15 million Ordinary Shares at 
a cost of approximately EUR68 million in the 2013 fiscal year. In fiscal year 2014, 69.5 million Ordinary Shares 
(including just over 6.0 million ADRs) were repurchased at a cost of approximately EUR481.7 million. As a result, 
the total amount spent on the share buy-back programs to date was approximately EUR1,019.8 million with respect 
to the repurchase of 198.6 million Ordinary Shares. All Ordinary Shares (including ADRs which represent five 
Ordinary Shares) repurchased have been cancelled.

Body
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and the results of 
such estimates form the basis of judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. A revision to an accounting estimate is 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in 
the period of the revision and future periods if these are also affected. Principal sources of estimation 
uncertainty have been set forth in the critical accounting policies section below. Actual results may 
differ from estimates.
 The Company believes that its critical accounting policies, which are those that require management's 
most difficult, subjective and complex judgements, are those described in this section. These critical 
accounting policies, the judgements and other uncertainties affecting application of these policies and 
the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions are factors to be considered 
in reviewing the consolidated financial statements.
 Long-lived assets
 As of March 31, 2014, Ryanair had EUR5.1 billion of property, plant and equipment long-lived assets, 
virtually all of which consisted of aircraft. In accounting for long-lived assets, Ryanair must make 
estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets and 
the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate.
 In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, Ryanair has primarily relied on its 
own and industry experience, recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of all of the Company's 
aircraft, and other data available in the marketplace. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can 
be significant, could be caused by changes to Ryanair's maintenance programme, changes in utilisation of 
the aircraft, changes to governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices for new 
and used aircraft of the same or similar types. Ryanair evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each 
reporting period, and, when warranted, adjusts these assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are 
accounted for on a prospective basis, through depreciation expense.
 Ryanair periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate 
potential impairment would include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of 
an aircraft, a significant change in an aircraft's physical condition and operating or cash flow losses 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -66-
associated with the use of the aircraft. While the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of 
these factors from time to time, Ryanair has not yet been seriously impacted and continues to record 
positive cash flows from these long-lived assets. Consequently, Ryanair has not yet identified any 
impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its long-lived 
assets and the general airline operating environment.
 The Company's estimate of the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values is 15% of current market 
value of new aircraft, determined periodically, based on independent valuations and actual aircraft 
disposals during prior periods. Aircraft are depreciated over a useful life of 23 years from the date of 
manufacture to residual value.
 Heavy maintenance
 An element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed, on acquisition, to its service potential, 
reflecting the maintenance condition of the engines and airframe.
 For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, Ryanair is contractually committed to either return 
the aircraft in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the 
airframe, engines and life-limited parts upon return. In order to fulfill such conditions of the lease, 
maintenance, in the form of major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major 
life-limited parts, is required to be performed during the period of the lease and upon return of the 
aircraft to the lessor. The estimated airframe and engine maintenance costs and the costs associated with 
the restitution of major life-limited parts, are accrued and charged to profit or loss over the lease term 
for this contractual obligation, based on the present value of the estimated future cost of the major 
airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major life-limited parts, calculated by 
reference to the number of hours flown or cycles operated during the year.
 Ryanair's aircraft operating lease agreements typically have a term of seven years, which closely 
correlates with the timing of heavy maintenance checks. The contractual obligation to maintain and 
replenish aircraft held under operating lease exists independently of any future actions within the 
control of Ryanair.
 While Ryanair may, in very limited circumstances, sub-lease its aircraft, it remains fully liable to 
perform all of its contractual obligations under the 'head lease' notwithstanding any such sub-leasing.
 Both of these elements of accounting policies involve the use of estimates in determining the quantum of 
both the initial maintenance asset and/or the amount of provisions to be recorded and the respective 
periods over which such amounts are charged to income. In making such estimates, Ryanair has primarily 
relied on its own and industry experience, industry regulations and recommendations from Boeing; however, 
these estimates can be subject to revision, depending on a number of factors, such as the timing of the 
planned maintenance, the ultimate utilisation of the aircraft, changes to government regulations and 
increases or decreases in estimated costs. Ryanair evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each 
reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts its assumptions, which generally impact maintenance and 
depreciation expense in the income statement on a prospective basis.
 Tax Audits
 Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.  Current tax payable on 
taxable profits is recognised as an expense in the period in which the profits arise using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  Deferred tax is provided in full, using the 
balance sheet liability method on temporary differences arising from the tax basis of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements.
 Social insurance, passenger taxes and sales taxes are recorded as a liability based on laws enacted in 
the jurisdictions to which they relate. Liabilities are recorded when an obligation has been incurred.
 Ryanair reviews its tax obligations by jurisdiction regularly.  There are many complexities and 
judgements in determining tax obligations due to the inherent complexity of tax law, the manner in which 
airline businesses are carried out whereby operations can begin and end in different jurisdictions and 
assumptions made about the timing and amount of individual balances to be included in financial statements 
and tax returns.
 Ryanair has an internal tax group and takes professional advice on more complex matters in estimating its 
tax liabilities.  Ryanair also deals extensively with revenue authorities in each jurisdiction in which it 
operates.   Tax liabilities are based on the best estimate of the likely obligation at each reporting 
period.  These estimates are subject to revision based on the outcome of tax audits and discussions with 
revenue authorities that can take several years to conclude.
 Basis of consolidation
 The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Ryanair Holdings plc and its 
subsidiary undertakings as of March 31, 2014. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by Ryanair. Control 
exists when Ryanair is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
 All inter-company account balances and any unrealised income or expenses arising from intra-group 
transactions have been eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -66-
 The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the 
consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal. Upon the 
acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the separable net assets acquired.
 Foreign currency translation
 Items included in the financial statements of each of the group entities are measured using the currency 
of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the "functional currency"). The 
consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, which is the functional currency of the majority 
of the group entities.
 Transactions arising in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies at 
the rates of exchange in effect at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance 
sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to euro 
at foreign exchange rates in effect at the dates the transactions were effected. Foreign currency 
differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for differences arising on 
qualifying cash-flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.

 --      On page 28 of the Corporate Governance Report, in considering management's assessment of the 
Group's ability to continue as a going concern, the Audit Committee had regard to the EUR850.0 million 
eurobond Issuance in June 2014, available financing facilities, facility headroom, the cash on hand of 
approximately EUR3.2bn and the sensitivity to changes in these items. The Committee focussed on the 
Group's cash generation projections through to the end of the current aircraft purchase programme in the 
financial year ending 31 March 2019. On the basis of the review performed, and the discussions held with 
management, the Committee was satisfied that that it was appropriate that the financial statements should 
continue to be prepared on a going concern basis, and that there were no material uncertainties that may 
cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern which need to be disclosed in 
the annual report.
 The Audit Committee meets the external auditors four times per year. At these meetings:
 --      the external audit plan is considered and approved;
 --      the quarterly, interim and annual results are considered and approved, following consideration of 
the significant issues relating to these matters, having regard to matters communicated to the Audit 
Committee by the external auditors;
 --      the Annual Report and Form 20F, which is filed annually with the United States Securities and 
Exchange Commission,  the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, is considered and approved;
 --      the procedures and safeguards which the external auditors have put in place to ensure their 
objectivity and independence in accordance with regulatory and professional requirements are reviewed;
 --      the letters of engagement and representation are reviewed; and
 --      the fees paid to the external auditors for audit and non audit work are reviewed, to ensure that 
the fee levels are appropriate and that audit independence is not compromised through the level of non 
audit fees and the nature of non audit work carried out by the external auditors.
 In addition the Audit Committee completed an evaluation questionnaire on the external auditor process.
 The last external audit tender was conducted in 2010. Detailed consideration was given to the external 
audit arrangements in 2013. It was concluded that, in the light of the performance of the external 
auditors and partner rotation plans that a decision as to the timing of the next tender process would be 
made following consideration of the FRC guidance and new EU regulations in this area. KPMG have been 
auditors to the Company since its incorporation in 1985.
 Remuneration Committee
 The Board of Directors established the Remuneration Committee in September 1996. This committee has 
authority to determine the remuneration of senior executives of the Company and to administer the stock 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -8-
option plans described below.  Senior Management remuneration is comprised of a fixed basic pay and 
performance related bonuses which are awarded based on a combination of the achievement of individual 
objectives and the Company's financial performance. The Board of Directors as a whole determines the 
remuneration and bonuses of the Chief Executive Officer, who is the only executive director. James 
Osborne, Louise Phelan and Julie O'Neill are the members of the Remuneration Committee.
 The role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are set out in its written terms of 
reference, which are available on the Company's website www.ryanair.com. The terms of Reference of the 
Remuneration Committee are reviewed annually.
 Nomination Committee
 Messrs. David Bonderman, Michael O'Leary and Kyran McLaughlin are the members of the Nomination 
Committee. The Nomination Committee assists the Board in ensuring that the composition of the Board and 
its Committees is appropriate to the needs of the Company by:
 --      assessing the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity required on the Board and the extent to 
which each are represented;
 --      establishing processes for the identification of suitable candidates for appointment to the 
Board; and
 --      overseeing succession planning for the Board and senior management.
 The role and responsibilities of the Nomination Committee are set out in its written terms of reference, 
which are available on the Company's website            www.ryanair.com. The Nomination Committee use 
their extensive business and professional contacts to identify suitable candidates. The terms of Reference 
of the Nomination Committee are reviewed annually.
 Air Safety Committee
 The Board of Directors established the Air Safety Committee in March 1997 to review and discuss air 
safety and related issues. The Air Safety Committee reports to the full Board of Directors each quarter. 
The Air Safety Committee is composed of Michael Horgan and Howard Millar, Chief Financial Officer and the 
Accountable Manager for Safety (who both act as co-chairman), as well as the following executive officers 
of Ryanair: Messrs. Michael Hickey, David O'Brien, Edward Wilson and Chief Pilot, Mr Ray Conway.
 Code of Business Conduct
 Ryanair's standards of integrity and ethical values have been established and are documented in Ryanair's 
Code of Business Conduct. This code is applicable to all Ryanair employees. There are established channels 
for reporting code violations or other concerns in a confidential manner. The Head of Internal Audit 
investigates any instances and reports findings directly to the Audit Committee.  The Code is available on 
the Company's website,            www.ryanair.com.

 Performance Evaluation
 The Board has established a formal process to annually evaluate the performance of the Board, that of its 
principal Committees, the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration committees, and that of the Chief Executive,  
the Chairman and individual non-executive directors. The Board anticipates that the formal evaluation will 
be completed yearly. Based on the evaluation process completed, the Board considers that the principal 
Committees have performed effectively throughout the year. As part of the Board evaluation of its own 
performance, questionnaires are circulated to all directors. The questionnaire is designed to obtain 
directors' comments regarding the performance of the Board, the effectiveness of Board communications, the 
ability of directors to contribute to the development of strategy and the effectiveness with which the 
Board monitors risk and oversees Ryanair's progress.  Directors are also invited to make recommendations 
for improvement.
 The Chairman, on behalf of the Board, reviews the evaluations of performance of the non-executive 
directors on an annual basis. The non-executive directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, meet 
annually without the Chairman present to evaluate his performance, having taken into account the views of 
the executive director. The non-executive directors also evaluate the performance of the executive 
director. These evaluations are designed to determine whether each director continues to contribute 
effectively and to demonstrate commitment to the role.
 The Audit, Nomination and Remuneration committees carry out annual reviews of their own performance and 
terms of reference to ensure they are operating at maximum effectiveness and recommend any changes they 
consider necessary to the Board for approval.
 The Board considers the results of the evaluation process and any issues identified.  The above 
evaluations were conducted in May 2013 and were presented to the Board at the September 2013 Board meeting 
in respect of the year under review.

Since certain of the Ordinary Shares are held by brokers or other nominees, the number of direct record holders in 
the United States, which is reported as 55, may not be fully indicative of the number of direct beneficial owners in 
the United States, or of where the direct beneficial owners of such shares are resident.
 In order to increase the percentage of its share capital held by EU nationals, beginning June 26, 2001, Ryanair 
Holdings instructed the Depositary to suspend the issuance of new ADRs in exchange for the deposit of Ordinary 
Shares until further notice. Therefore, holders of Ordinary Shares cannot currently convert their Ordinary Shares 
into ADRs. The Depositary will however convert existing ADRs into Ordinary Shares at the request of the holders of 
such ADRs. The Company in 2002 implemented additional measures to restrict the ability of non-EU nationals to 
purchase Ordinary Shares. As a result, non-EU nationals are currently effectively barred from purchasing Ordinary 
Shares. See "Item 10. Additional Information-Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals" for additional 
information.
 The Company, at its annual general meeting of the Shareholders, has, in recent years, passed a special resolution 
permitting the Company to engage in Ordinary Share buy-back programs subject to certain limits noted below. 
Since June 2007 (when the Company engaged in its first Ordinary Share buy-back program) the Company has 
repurchased the following Ordinary Shares:

All Ordinary Shares repurchased have been cancelled.
 The maximum price at which the Company may repurchase Ordinary Shares, in accordance with the listing rules of 
the Irish Stock Exchange and of the Financial Services Authority, is the higher of 5% above the average market 
value of the Company's Ordinary Shares for the five business days prior to the day of the repurchase and the price 
stipulated by Article 5(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) of December 22, 2003 (No. 2273/2003) (which is the 
higher of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the Irish Stock Exchange). The 
minimum price at which the Company may repurchase Ordinary Shares is their nominal value, currently 0.635 euro 
cent per share.
 At an extraordinary general meeting of Shareholders held on April 19, 2012, the Company obtained a new 
repurchase authority which enables the Company to repurchase the Company's ADRs which are traded on 
NASDAQ. The maximum price at which Ordinary Shares which underlie the Company's ADRs can be repurchased 
is 5% above one-fifth of the average market value of the Company's ADRs as quoted on NASDAQ, for the five 
business days prior to the date of purchase (as one ADS represents five Ordinary Shares). Any ADRs purchased 
will be converted to Ordinary Shares by the Company's brokers for subsequent repurchase and cancellation by the 
Company. During fiscal 2014, the Company repurchased 6,018,800 ADRs equivalent to 30,094,000 ordinary shares 
at a price per ADR of $49.01 equivalent to approximately EUR7.41 per ordinary share.
 As of June 30, 2014, the total number of options over Ordinary Shares outstanding under all of the Company's 
share option plans was 4,814,391, representing 0.3% of the Company's issued share capital at that date.
 Item 10. Additional Information
 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
 Ryanair Holdings' capital stock consists of Ordinary Shares, each having a par value of 0.635 euro cent. As of 
March 31, 2014, a total of 1,383,237,668 Ordinary Shares were outstanding. On February 26, 2007, Ryanair 
effected a 2-for-1 share split as a result of which each of its then existing Ordinary Shares, par value 1.27 euro cent, 
was split into two new Ordinary Shares, par value 0.635 euro cent. Each Ordinary Share entitles the holder thereof 
to one vote in respect of any matter voted upon by Ryanair Holdings' shareholders.
 OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SECURITIES FROM REGISTRANT OR SUBSIDIARIES
 Ryanair Holdings' shareholders approved a stock option plan (referred to herein as "Option Plan 2000"), under 
which all employees and directors are eligible to receive options. Grants of options were permitted to take place at 
the close of any of the ten years beginning with fiscal year 2000 only if the Company's net profit after tax for such 
fiscal year had exceeded its net profit after tax for the prior fiscal year by at least 25%, or if an increase of 1% in net 
profit after tax for the relevant year would have resulted in such requirement being met.

 On July 10, 2012, the Competition Commission ruled that Ryanair's bid was not in breach of the UK 
Enterprise Act, but nevertheless decided that its investigation of the minority stake could proceed in 
parallel with the European Commission's investigation of Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus.  In July 2012, 
Ryanair appealed the latter part of the Competition Commission's ruling to the UK Competition Appeal 
Tribunal, and the Competition Commission's investigation became suspended pending the appeal process.  On 
August 8, 2012, the Competition Appeal Tribunal ("CAT") rejected Ryanair's appeal and found that the 
Competition Commission's investigation could proceed in parallel with the European Commission's 
investigation, but that the Competition Commission must avoid taking any final decision which could 
conflict with the European Commission's ultimate conclusion on Ryanair's bid.  In August 2012, Ryanair 
appealed the Competition Appeal Tribunal judgment to the UK Court of Appeal.  In December 2012, the Court 
of Appeal rejected Ryanair's appeal and subsequently the Competition Commission's investigation restarted.  
On December 13, 2012, Ryanair applied to the UK Supreme Court for permission to appeal the judgment of the 
UK Court of Appeal.  The UK Supreme Court refused permission to appeal on April 25, 2013.
 On February 27, 2013, the European Commission prohibited Ryanair's bid to acquire the entire share 
capital of Aer Lingus on the claimed basis that it would be incompatible with the EU internal market.  
Ryanair appealed this decision to the EU General Court on May 8, 2013. The judgment of the EU General 
Court is expected in 2015 and may affirm or annul the decision of the European Commission.
 Following the European Commission's decision to prohibit its offer for Aer Lingus, Ryanair actively 
engaged with the UK Competition Commission's investigation of the minority stake. On August 28, 2013, the 
UK Competition Commission (the "UKCC") issued its final decision in which it found that Ryanair's 
shareholding "gave it the ability to exercise material influence over Aer Lingus" and "had led or may be 
expected to lead to a substantial lessening of competition in the markets for air passenger services 
between Great Britain and Ireland."  As a result of its findings, the UKCC ordered Ryanair to reduce its 
shareholding in Aer Lingus to below 5 percent of Aer Lingus' issued ordinary shares.  Ryanair appealed the 
UKCC's final decision to the CAT on September 23, 2013.  The CAT rejected Ryanair's appeal on March 7, 
2014. On April 23, 2014, the CAT granted Ryanair permission to appeal the CAT's judgment to the UK Court 
of Appeal. Should this appeal or any subsequent appeal to the UK Supreme Court be unsuccessful, Ryanair 
could suffer losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a significant 
portion of Aer Lingus' shares.  Ryanair believes that the enforcement of any such decision should be 
delayed until the outcome of Ryanair's appeal against the European Commission's February 2013 prohibition 
decision of Ryanair's 2012 offer for Aer Lingus, and the conclusion of any appeals against the UKCC's 
decision in the UK courts.  However, it is possible that the UKCC will seek to enforce any such sell-down 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -20-
remedy at an earlier date.  For more information, see "Item 8. Financial Information-Other Financial 
Information-Legal Proceedings-Matters Related to Investment in Aer Lingus."
 Labor Relations Could Expose the Company to Risk. A variety of factors, including, but not limited to, 
Ryanair's profitability and its seasonal grounding policy, may make it difficult for Ryanair to avoid 
increases to salary levels and productivity payments. Consequently, there can be no assurance that 
Ryanair's existing employee compensation arrangements may not be subject to change or modification at any 
time. These steps may lead to deterioration in labor relations in Ryanair and could impact Ryanair's 
business or results. Ryanair also operates in certain jurisdictions with above average payroll taxes and 
employee-related social insurance costs, which could have an impact on the availability and cost of 
employees in these jurisdictions. Ryanair's crew in continental Europe generally operate on Irish 
contracts of employment on the basis thatthose crew work on Irish Territory, (i.e., on board Irish 
Registered Aircraft). A number of challenges have been initiated by government agencies in a number of 
countries to the applicability of Irish labor law to these contracts, and if Ryanair were forced to 
concede that Irish jurisdiction did not apply to those crew who operate from continental Europe then it 
could lead to increased salary, social insurance and pension costs and a potential loss of flexibility. In 
relation to social insurance costs, the European Parliament implemented amendments to Regulation (EC) 
883/2004 which, in the majority of jurisdictions, imposes substantial social insurance contribution 
increases for either or both Ryanair and the individual employees. While this change to social insurance 
contributions relates primarily to new employees, its effect in the long term may materially increase 
Company or employee social insurance contributions and could affect Ryanair's decision to operate from 
those high cost locations, resulting in redundancies and a consequent deterioration in labor relations.   
For additional details see - "Change in EU Regulations in Relation to Employers and Employee Social 
Insurance could Increase Costs" below.
 Ryanair currently conducts collective bargaining negotiations with groups of employees, including its 
pilots and cabin crew, regarding pay, work practices, and conditions of employment, through collective-
bargaining units called "Employee Representative Committees". On June 19, 2009, BALPA (the U.K. pilots 
union) made a request for voluntary recognition under applicable U.K. legislation, which Ryanair rejected. 
BALPA had the option of applying to the U.K.'s Central Arbitration Committee (CAC) to organize a vote on 
union recognition by Ryanair's pilots in relevant bargaining units, as determined by the CAC, but BALPA 
decided not to proceed with an application at that time. The option to apply for a ballot remains open to 
BALPA and if it were to seek and be successful in such a ballot, it would be able to represent the U.K. 
pilots in negotiations over salaries and working conditions. Limitations on Ryanair's flexibility in 
dealing with its employees or the altering of the public's perception of Ryanair generally could have a 
material adverse effect on Ryanair's business, operating results, and financial condition. For additional 
details, see "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Staff and Labor Relations." Limitations 
on Ryanair's flexibility in dealing with its staff or the altering of the public's perception of Ryanair 
generally could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, and financial 
condition.
 The Company is Dependent on External Service Providers.Ryanair currently assigns its engine overhauls and 
"rotable" repairs to outside contractors approved under the terms of Part 145, the European regulatory 
standard for aircraft maintenance established by the European Aviation Safety Agency ("Part 145"). The 
Company also assigns its passenger, aircraft and ground handling services at airports other than Dublin 
and certain airports in Spain and the Canary Islands to established external service providers. See "Item 
4. Information on the Company-Maintenance and Repairs-Heavy Maintenance" and "Item 4. Information on the 
Company-Airport Operations 3/4 Airport Handling Services."
 The termination or expiration of any of Ryanair's service contracts or any inability to renew them or 
negotiate replacement contracts with other service providers at comparable rates could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. Ryanair will need to enter into airport service 
agreements in any new markets it enters, and there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain the 
necessary facilities and services at competitive rates. In addition, although Ryanair seeks to monitor the 
performance of external parties that provide passenger and aircraft handling services, the efficiency, 
timeliness, and quality of contract performance by external providers are largely beyond Ryanair's direct 
control. Ryanair expects to be dependent on such outsourcing arrangements for the foreseeable future.
 The Company is Dependent on Key Personnel. Ryanair's success depends to a significant extent upon the 
efforts and abilities of its senior management team, including Michael O'Leary, the Chief Executive 
Officer, and key financial, commercial, operating and maintenance personnel. Mr. O'Leary's current 
contract may be terminated by either party upon 12 months' notice.  See "Item 6. Directors, Senior 
Management and Employees-Compensation of Directors and Senior Management-Employment and Bonus Agreement 
with Mr. O'Leary." Ryanair's success also depends on the ability of its executive officers and other 
members of senior management to operate and manage effectively, both independently and as a group. 
Although Ryanair's employment agreements with Mr. O'Leary and some of its other senior executives contain 
non-competition and non-disclosure provisions, there can be no assurance that these provisions will be 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -20-
enforceable in whole or in part. Competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, and either the 
loss of any executive officer, senior manager, or other key employee without adequate replacement or the 
inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect upon Ryanair's business, 
operating results, and financial condition.

 Ryanair Holdings' shareholders approved a stock option plan (referred to herein as "Option Plan 2003") 
established in accordance with a then tax-favorable share option scheme available under Irish law, so that 
employees would not be subject to income tax on the exercise of options (subject to certain conditions). 
Option Plan 2003 was approved by the Revenue Commissioners on July 4, 2003 for the purposes of Chapter 4, 
Part 17, of the Irish Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 and Schedule 12C of that Act. Following the 
publication of the Irish National Recovery Plan: 2011-2014 (the "NRP") on November 24, 2010, Revenue 
approved share option plans, such as Option Plan 2003, no longer qualified for favorable tax treatment 
from that date. All employees and full-time directors were eligible to participate in the plan, under 
which grants of options could be made at the close of any of the ten years beginning with fiscal year 2002 
only if the Company's net profit after tax for such fiscal year had exceeded its net profit after tax for 
the prior fiscal year by at least 25%, or if an increase of 1% in net profit after tax for the relevant 
year would have resulted in such requirement being met.
 Under Option Plan 2000, 20 senior managers (including seven of the current executive officers) were 
granted 10,500,000 share options, in the aggregate, at a strike price of EUR3.21 in July 2005. Not all of 
the vesting conditions were met, and as a result only 80% of the options granted that satisfied the 
conditions were exercisable between August 1, 2011 and August 31, 2013.  The Company recognized a credit 
of EUR2.5 million in relation to the options that did not vest in June 2011. Also, under Option Plan 2000, 
each of the non-executive directors were granted 25,000 share options, at a strike price of EUR4.96, 
during the 2008 fiscal year. These options are exercisable between June 2012 and June 2014. In addition, 
39 senior managers (including five of the current executive officers) were granted 10,000,000 share 
options, in the aggregate, under Option Plan 2000, at a strike price of EUR2.56, on September 18, 2008. 
These options are exercisable between September 18, 2013 and September 17, 2015, but only for managers who 
continued to be employed by the Company through September 18, 2013.
 During fiscal year 2014, Ryanair Holdings' shareholders approved a stock option plan at the Company's 
annual general meeting on September 20, 2013 (referred to herein as "Option Plan 2013"), under which all 
employees and directors are eligible to receive options. Grants of options were permitted to take place at 
the close of any of the ten years beginning with fiscal year 2014. All options will be subject to a five 
year performance period beginning with the year in which a grant occurs. The Remuneration Committee has 
discretion to determine the financial performance targets that must be met with respect to the financial 
year. Those targets will relate directly to the achievement of certain year-on-year growth targets in the 
Company's profit after tax figures for each of the financial years of the performance period and/or 
certain share price targets. The Option Plan 2013 will replace two stock options plans previously approved 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -54-
by shareholders (Option Plan 2000 and Option Plan 2003) for all future grants, as both of these plans have 
expired, although any subsisting options granted under Option Plan 2000 or Option Plan 2003 that have not 
yet lapsed will continue to be governed by all terms of those plans, as applicable.
 The aggregate of 4,814,391 Ordinary Shares that would be issuable upon exercise in full of the options 
that were outstanding as of June 30, 2014 under Company's option plan represent approximately 0.3% of the 
issued share capital of Ryanair Holdings as of such date. Of such total, options in respect of an 
aggregate of 1,397,500 Ordinary Shares were held by the directors and executive officers of Ryanair 
Holdings. For further information, see notes 15 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements included 
herein.
 ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
 The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Articles of Association of Ryanair Holdings. This 
summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text 
of the Articles, which are included as an exhibit to this annual report.
 Objects. Ryanair Holdings' objects, which are detailed in its Articles, are broad and include carrying on 
business as an investment and holding company. Ryanair Holdings' Irish company registration number is 
249885.
 Directors. Subject to certain exceptions, directors may not vote on matters in which they have a material 
interest. The ordinary remuneration of the directors is determined from time to time by ordinary 
resolutions of the shareholders. Any director who holds any executive office, serves on any committee or 
otherwise performs services, which, in the opinion of the directors, are outside the scope of the ordinary 
duties of a director, may be paid such extra remuneration as the directors may determine. The directors 
may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money. These powers may be amended by special 
resolution of the shareholders. The directors are not required to retire at any particular age. There is 
no requirement for directors to hold shares. The Articles of Association provide that one-third of the 
directors retire and offer themselves for re-election at each annual general meeting of the Company. The 
directors to retire by rotation are those who have been longest in office since their last appointment or 
reappointment. As between persons who became or were appointed directors on the same date, those to retire 
are determined by agreement between them or, otherwise, by lot. All of the shareholders entitled to attend 
and vote at the annual general meeting of the Company may vote on the re-election of directors.
 Annual and General Meetings. Annual and extraordinary meetings are called upon 21 days' advance notice. 
At Ryanair's annual general meeting, held on September 22, 2010, the Company's Articles of Association 
were amended by special resolution to reflect the implementation of the Shareholders' Rights (Directive 
2007/36/EC) Regulations 2009 to allow all Ryanair shareholders to appoint proxies electronically to 
attend, speak, ask questions and vote on behalf of them at annual general meetings and to reflect certain 
other provisions of those Regulations. All holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to attend, speak at and 
vote at general meetings of the Company, subject to limitations described below under "-Limitations on the 
Right to Own Shares."
 Rights, Preferences and Dividends Attaching to Shares. The Company has only one class of shares, Ordinary 
Shares with a par value of 0.635 euro cent per share. All such shares rank equally with respect to payment 
of dividends and on any winding-up of the Company. Any dividend, interest or other sum payable to a 
shareholder that remains unclaimed for one year after having been declared may be invested by the 
directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. If the directors so resolve, any dividend which 
has remained unclaimed for 12 years from the date of its declaration shall be forfeited and cease to 
remain owing by the Company. The Company is permitted under its Articles to issue redeemable shares on 
such terms and in such manner as the Company may, by special resolution, determine. The Ordinary Shares 
currently in issue are not redeemable. The liability of shareholders to invest additional capital is 
limited to the amounts remaining unpaid on the shares held by them. There are no sinking fund provisions 
in the Articles of the Company.
 Action Necessary to Change the Rights of Shareholders. The rights attaching to shares in the Company may 
be varied by special resolutions passed at meetings of the shareholders of the Company.
 Limitations on the Rights to Own Shares. The Articles contain detailed provisions enabling the directors 
of the Company to limit the number of shares in which non-EU nationals have an interest or the exercise by 
non-EU nationals of rights attaching to shares. See "-Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals" 
below. Such powers may be exercised by the directors if they are of the view that any license, consent, 
permit or privilege of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that enables it to operate an air service 
may be refused, withheld, suspended or revoked or have conditions attached to it that inhibit its exercise 
and the exercise of the powers referred to above could prevent such an occurrence. The exercise of such 
powers could result in non-EU holders of shares being prevented from attending, speaking at or voting at 
general meetings of the Company and/or being required to dispose of shares held by them to EU nationals.
 Disclosure of Share Ownership. Under Irish law, the Company can require parties to disclose their 
interests in shares. The Articles of the Company entitle the directors to require parties to complete 
declarations indicating their nationality and the nature and extent of any interest which such parties 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -54-
hold in Ordinary Shares before allowing such parties to transfer such Ordinary Shares. See, also "-
Limitations on Share Ownership by non-EU nationals" below. Under Irish law, if a party acquires or 
disposes of Ordinary Shares so as to bring his interest above or below 5% of the total issued share 
capital of the Company, he must notify the Company of that. The Irish Stock Exchange must also be notified 
of any acquisition or disposal of shares that brings the shareholding of a party above or below certain 
specified percentages - i.e., 10%, 25%, 50% and 75%.
 Other Provisions of the Articles of Association. There are no provisions in the Articles:
 (i)    delaying or prohibiting a change in the control of the Company, but which operate only with 
respect to a merger, acquisition or corporate restructuring;
 (ii)   discriminating against any existing or prospective holder of shares as a result of such 
shareholder owning a substantial number of shares; or

Body
 Aircraft Equipment Costs. Ryanair's primary strategy for controlling aircraft acquisition costs is focused on 
operating a single aircraft type. Ryanair currently operates only "next generation" Boeing 737-800s. Ryanair's 
continuous acquisition of new Boeing 737-800s has already and is expected, through the end of fiscal 2019, to 
increase the size of its fleet and thus increase its aircraft equipment and related costs (on an aggregate basis). 
However, the purchase of aircraft from a single manufacturer enables Ryanair to limit the costs associated with 
personnel training, maintenance, and the purchase and storage of spare parts while also affording the Company 
greater flexibility in the scheduling of crews and equipment. Management also believes that the terms of Ryanair's 
contracts with Boeing are very favorable to Ryanair. See " 3/4 Aircraft" below for additional information on Ryanair's 
fleet.
 Personnel Costs. Ryanair endeavors to control its labor costs by seeking to continually improve the productivity of 
its already highly productive work force. Compensation for personnel emphasizes productivity-based pay 
incentives. These incentives include sales bonus payments for onboard sales of products for flight attendants and 
payments based on the number of hours or sectors flown by pilots and flight attendants within limits set by industry 
standards or regulations fixing maximum working hours.
 Customer Service Costs. Ryanair has entered into agreements on competitive terms with external contractors at 
certain airports for ticketing, passenger and aircraft handling, and other services that management believes can be 
more cost-efficiently provided by third parties. Management attempts to obtain competitive rates for such services 
by negotiating fixed-price, multi-year contracts. The development of its own Internet booking facility has allowed 
Ryanair to eliminate travel agent commissions. As part of its strategic initiatives, the Company has broadened its 
distribution base by making Ryanair's fares available to Travelport (Galileo and Worldspan) at nominal cost to the 
Company. Ryanair generates over 99% of its scheduled passenger revenues through direct sales via its website.
 Airport Access and Handling Costs. Ryanair attempts to control airport access and service charges by focusing on 
airports that offer competitive prices. Management believes that Ryanair's record of delivering a consistently high 
volume of passenger traffic growth at many airports has allowed it to negotiate favorable contracts with such 
airports for access to their facilities, although the recent change in strategy by the Company may see it access 
some more primary airports, which typically have higher airport charges and greater competition along with slot 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -26-
limitations. Secondary and regional airports also generally do not have slot requirements or other operating 
restrictions that can increase operating expenses and limit the number of allowed take-offs and landings. Ryanair 
further endeavors to reduce its airport charges by opting, when practicable, for less expensive gate locations as 
well as outdoor boarding stairs, rather than jetways, which are more expensive and operationally less efficient to 
use. In addition, since October 2009, Ryanair has required all passengers to check-in on the Internet. This 
requirement was instituted to reduce waiting times at airports and speed a passenger's journey from arrival at the 
airport to boarding, as well as significantly reduce airport handling costs. Ryanair has also introduced a checked-
bag fee, which is payable on the Internet at the time of booking and is aimed at reducing the number of bags carried 
by passengers in order to further reduce handling costs. See "Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-The 
Company Faces Risks Related to its Internet Reservations Operations and its Announced Elimination of Airport 
Check-in Facilities."
 Taking Advantage of the Internet. In 2000, Ryanair converted its host reservation system to a new system, which it 
operates under a hosting agreement with Navitaire that was extended in 2011 and will terminate in 2020. As part of 
the implementation of the reservation system, Navitaire developed an Internet booking facility. The Ryanair system 
allows Internet users to access its host reservation system and to make and pay for confirmed reservations in real 
time through the Ryanair.com website. After the launch of the Internet reservation system, Ryanair heavily 
promoted its website through newspaper, radio and television advertising. As a result, Internet bookings grew 
rapidly, and have accounted for over 99% of all reservations over the past several years. In May 2012, Ryanair 
further upgraded the reservation system, which offers more flexibility for future system enhancements and to 
accommodate the future growth of Ryanair. In November 2013, Ryanair re-launched its website in a new, easier to 
use, format that reduced the booking process from 17 to 5 "clicks". Various other initiatives were also introduced, 
including a fare finder facility which enables customers to easily find the lowest fares. The new "My Ryanair" 
registration services, which allows customers to securely store their personal and payment details, has also 
significantly quickened the booking process and made it easier for customers to book a flight. The Company also 
launched a new mobile app on July 15, 2014, which will make it simpler and easier for customers to book Ryanair 
flights.
 Commitment to Safety and Quality Maintenance. Safety is the primary priority of Ryanair and its management. This 
commitment begins with the hiring and training of Ryanair's pilots, flight attendants, and maintenance personnel 
and includes a policy of maintaining its aircraft in accordance with the highest European airline industry standards. 
Ryanair has not had a single passenger or flight crew fatality as a result of an accident with one of its aircraft in its 
30-year operating history. Although Ryanair seeks to maintain its fleet in a cost-effective manner, management 
does not seek to extend Ryanair's low-cost operating strategy to the areas of safety, maintenance, training or 
quality assurance. Routine aircraft maintenance and repair services are performed primarily by Ryanair, at 
Ryanair's main bases, but are also performed at other base airports by maintenance contractors approved under 
the terms of a European Aviation Safety Agency ("EASA") Part 145 approval. Ryanair currently performs heavy 
airframe maintenance, but contracts with other parties who perform engine overhaul services and rotable repairs. 
These contractors also provide similar services to a number of other airlines, including Southwest Airlines, British 
Airways, Air France and Alitalia.
 Enhancement of Operating Results through Ancillary Services. Ryanair distributes accommodation services and 
travel insurance primarily through its website. For hotel services, Ryanair has a contract with Hotelscombined PTY 
Ltd, and they provide a hotel comparison website to Ryanair which generates commissions for Ryanair on the 
number of bookings made. Ryanair also has a contract with Bookings.com to market hotels during the website 
booking process. In addition, Ryanair has a contract with the Hertz Corporation ("Hertz"), pursuant to which Hertz 
handles all car rental services marketed through Ryanair's website or telephone reservation system. Ryanair also 
sells bus and some rail tickets onboard its aircraft and through its website. For the 2014 fiscal year, ancillary 
services accounted for approximately 25% of Ryanair's total operating revenues, as compared to approximately 
22% of such revenues in the 2013 fiscal year. See "-Ancillary Services" below and "Item 5. Operating and Financial 
Review and Prospects-Results of Operations-Fiscal Year 2014 Compared with Fiscal Year 2013-Ancillary 
Revenues" for additional information.
 Focused Criteria for Growth. Building on its success in the Ireland-U.K. market and its expansion of service to 
continental Europe and Morocco, Ryanair intends to follow a manageable growth plan targeting specific markets. 
Ryanair believes it will have opportunities for continued growth by: (i) using aggressive fare promotions to increase 
load factors; (ii) initiating additional routes in the EU; (iii) initiating additional routes in countries party to a European 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -26-
Common Aviation Agreement with the EU that are currently served by higher-cost, higher-fare carriers; (iv) 
increasing the frequency of service on its existing routes; (v) starting new domestic routes within individual EU 
countries; (vi) considering acquisition opportunities that may become available in the future; (vii) connecting airports 
within its existing route network ("triangulation"); (viii) establishing new bases; and (ix) initiating new routes not 
currently served by any carrier.
 Responding to Current Challenges. In recent periods, and with increased effect in the 2012, 2013 and 2014 fiscal 
years, Ryanair's low-fares business model has faced substantial pressure due to significantly increased fuel costs 
and reduced economic growth (or economic contraction) in some of the economies in which it operates. The 
Company has aimed to meet these challenges by: (i) grounding (approximately 70 in fiscal 2014 and 80 in fiscal 
2013) aircraft during the winter season; (ii) disposing of aircraft (lease hand backs totaled four in the 2013 fiscal 
year and eight in the 2014 fiscal year); (iii) controlling labor and other costs, including through wage freezes for non-
flight crew personnel in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2013, selective redundancies and the introduction of Internet check-in 
in fiscal 2010; and (iv) renegotiating contracts with existing suppliers, airports and handling companies. There can 
be no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving all of the foregoing or taking other similar 
measures, or that doing so will allow the Company to earn profits in any period. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk 
Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability Affect the Company's Results 
and Increase the Likelihood of Adverse

 into Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus pending the outcome of the appeal.  On May 22, 2012, the UK Court of 
Appeal found that the OFT was not time barred to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus in September 
2010. Ryanair subsequently sought permission to appeal this ruling to the UK Supreme Court but permission was 
refused.  On June 15, 2012, the OFT referred the investigation of Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus to the UK 
Competition Commission
 On June 19, 2012, Ryanair announced its third all cash offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it 
did not own at a price of EUR1.30 per ordinary share and immediately commenced pre-notification discussions with 
the European Commission for the purpose of preparing a merger filing.  Pending the outcome of the European 
Commission's review of Ryanair's bid, on the basis of the duty of "sincere cooperation" between the EU and the 
Member States, and under the EU Merger Regulation, the UK Competition Commission's investigation of Ryanair's 
minority stake in Aer Lingus should not have properly proceeded.  Nevertheless, Aer Lingus argued that the 
investigation should proceed and that Ryanair's offer was in breach of certain provisions of the UK Enterprise Act 
2002.
 On July 10, 2012, the Competition Commission ruled that Ryanair's bid was not in breach of the UK Enterprise Act, 
but nevertheless decided that its investigation of the minority stake could proceed in parallel with the European 
Commission's investigation of Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus.  In July 2012, Ryanair appealed the latter part of the 
Competition Commission's ruling to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal, and the Competition Commission's 
investigation became suspended pending the appeal process.  On August 8, 2012, the Competition Appeal Tribunal 
rejected Ryanair's appeal and found that the Competition Commission's investigation could proceed in parallel with 
the European Commission's investigation, but that the Competition Commission must avoid taking any final 
decision which could conflict with the European Commission's ultimate conclusion on Ryanair's bid.  In August 
2012, Ryanair appealed the Competition Appeal Tribunal judgment to the UK Court of Appeal.  In December 2012, 
the Court of Appeal rejected Ryanair's appeal and subsequently the Competition Commission's investigation has 
restarted.  On December 13, 2012, Ryanair applied to the UK Supreme Court for permission to appeal the judgment 
of the Court of Appeal.  The Supreme Court refused permission to appeal on April 25, 2013.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -50-
 On February 27, 2013 the European Commission prohibited Ryanair's bid to acquire the entire share capital of Aer 
Lingus on the claimed basis that it would be incompatible with the EU internal market.  Ryanair appealed this 
decision to the EU General Court on May 8, 2013. The judgment of the EU General Court is expected in 2015 and 
may affirm or annul the decision of the European Commission.
 The timing of Ryanair's 2012 offer for Aer Lingus was influenced by; (i) the continued consolidation of European 
airlines, and more recently the International Airlines Group (the parent company of British Airways) takeover of 
British Midland International, where the No.1 airline at Heathrow was allowed to acquire the No. 2; (ii) the additional 
capacity available at Dublin airport following the opening of Terminal 2 and the decline in traffic from 23.3 million 
passengers per annum in 2007 to 18.7 million in 2011, resulting in Dublin airport operating at approximately 50% 
capacity; (iii) the change in the Irish government policy since 2006 in that the Irish government indicated that it had 
decided to sell its stake in Aer Lingus; (iv) the fact that under the terms of the bailout agreement provided by the 
European Commission, European Central bank and International Monetary Fund to Ireland, the Irish government 
committed to sell its stake in Aer Lingus; (v) the fact that the ESOT (Employee Share Ownership Trust), which at 
the time of the unsuccessful 2006 offer controlled 15% of Aer Lingus, had been disbanded since December 2010 
and the shares distributed to the individual members, with the result that Ryanair's new offer was, in Ryanair's view, 
capable of reaching over 50% acceptance either with or without government acceptance; and (vi) the fact that 
Etihad, an Abu Dhabi based airline, had acquired a 3% stake in Aer Lingus and had expressed an interest in buying 
the Irish government's 25% stake in Aer Lingus (the offer now provides Etihad or any other potential bidder the 
opportunity to purchase the government's stake).
 Ryanair offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain the Aer Lingus brand, and to grow its traffic 
from 9.5 million to over 14.5 million passengers over a five year period post acquisition, by growing Aer Lingus' 
short haul traffic at some of Europe's major airports where Aer Lingus currently operates and Ryanair does not. 
Ryanair also intended to increase Aer Lingus' transatlantic traffic from Ireland, which has fallen in recent years, by 
investing in operations. If the offer had been accepted, the Irish government would have received EUR173 million in 
cash. The offer of EUR1.30 per share represented a premium of approximately 38% over the closing price of 
EUR0.94 for Aer Lingus shares as of June 19, 2012. The offer was conditional on competition approval by the 
European Commission.
 Following the European Commission's decision to prohibit its offer for Aer Lingus, Ryanair actively engaged with 
the Competition Commission's investigation of the minority stake. On August 28, 2013, the UK Competition 
Commission (UKCC) issued its final decision in which it stated that Ryanair's shareholding "gave it the ability to 
exercise material influence over Aer Lingus" and "had led or may be expected to lead to a substantial lessening of 
competition in the markets for air passenger services between Great Britain and Ireland."  As a result of its findings, 
the UKCC ordered Ryanair to reduce its shareholding in Aer Lingus to below 5 per cent of Aer Lingus' issued 
ordinary shares.  Ryanair appealed the UKCC's final decision to the CAT on September 23, 2013.  The CAT 
rejected Ryanair's appeal on March 7, 2014.  On April 23, 2014, the CAT granted Ryanair permission to appeal the 
CAT's judgment to the Court of Appeal. Should this appeal, or any subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court, be 
unsuccessful, Ryanair could suffer losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a 
significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares.  Ryanair believes that the enforcement of any such decision should be 
delayed until the outcome of Ryanair's appeal against the European Commission's February 2013 prohibition 
decision of Ryanair's 2012 offer for Aer Lingus, and the conclusion of any appeals against the UKCC's decision in 
the UK courts.  However, it is possible that the UKCC will seek to enforce any such sell-down remedy at an earlier 
date.
 Legal Actions Against Monopoly Airports. Ryanair has been involved in a number of legal and regulatory actions 
against the Dublin and London (Stansted) airports in relation to what Ryanair considers to be ongoing abuses of 
their dominant positions in the Dublin and London (Stansted) markets. Management believes that both of these 
airports have been engaging in "regulatory gaming" in order to achieve inflated airport charges under the regulatory 
processes in the U.K. and Ireland. By inflating its so-called "regulated asset base" (essentially the value of its airport 
facilities), a regulated airport can achieve higher returns on its assets through inflated airport charges. With respect 
to London (Stansted), the OFT, following complaints from Ryanair and other airlines, has recognized that the 
regulatory process is flawed and provides perverse incentives to regulated airports to spend excessively on 
infrastructure in order to inflate their airport charges. The OFT referred the case to the Competition Commission 
which released its preliminary findings in April 2008. It found that the common ownership by BAA of the three main 
airports in London affects competition and that the "light touch" regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority was having 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -50-
an adverse impact on competition. In March 2009, the Competition Commission published its final report on the 
BAA and ordered the breakup of the BAA, (which involved the sale of London (Gatwick) and London (Stansted) and 
either Glasgow or Edinburgh Airport in Scotland). In October 2009, London (Gatwick) was sold to Global 
Infrastructure Partners for GBP1.5 billion. In May 2009, BAA appealed the Competition Commission's decision on 
the bases of apparent bias and lack of proportionality. Ryanair secured the right to intervene in this appeal in 
support of the Competition Commission. The case was heard in October 2009 and in February 2010 the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal quashed the Competition Commission's ruling on the basis of the "apparent bias" 
claim. This decision was successfully appealed by both the Competition Commission and Ryanair before the Court 
of Appeal. The appeal was heard in June 2010 and the judgment was issued in October 2010, quashing the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal ruling and reinstating the Competition Commission March 2009 decision. In February 
2011, the Supreme Court refused to grant the BAA permission to appeal the Court of Appeal ruling. The 
Competition Commission has subsequently reconsidered the appropriateness of the remedies imposed on the BAA 
in March 2009 in light of the passage of time, and confirmed in its preliminary report in April 2011 that the remedies 
are still appropriate and the sale of Stansted and one of either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports should proceed. In 
July 2011, the Competition Commission confirmed its March 2011 provisional decision on "possible material 
changes of circumstances." It found that no material changes of circumstances (that would necessitate a change in 
the remedies package) had occurred since the March 2009 decision requiring the BAA to sell London (Gatwick), 
London (Stansted) and one of either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports, and that

 Profit after taxation. Ryanair recorded a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR569.3 million in the 2013 
fiscal year, as compared with a profit of EUR560.4 million in the 2012 fiscal year. This 1.6% increase was primarily 
attributable to an increase in revenues driven by a 4.3% increase in average fares and a 20.1% increase in ancillary 
revenues, partially offset by a 18.3% increase in fuel and oil costs from EUR1,593.6 million to EUR1,885.6 million. 
The result in fiscal 2012 included EUR57.8 million, net of tax, relating to a one off release of ticket sales revenue 
due to a change in accounting estimates arising in enhancements to Ryanair's revenue accounting system.
 Scheduled revenues. Ryanair's scheduled passenger revenues increased 9.0%, from EUR3,504.0 million in the 
2012 fiscal year, to EUR3,819.8 million in the 2013 fiscal year, primarily reflecting an increase of 4.3% in average 
fares. The number of passengers booked increased 4.5%, from 75.8 million to 79.3 million, reflecting increased 
passenger volumes on existing routes and the successful launch of new bases at Chania, Eindhoven, Fez, Krakow, 
Maastricht, Marrakech and Zadar in the 2013 fiscal year.  Booked passenger load factors remained flat at 82% in 
both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013.
 Passenger capacity during the 2013 fiscal year increased by 4.7% due to the addition of 11 Boeing 737-800 aircraft 
(net of lease handbacks). Scheduled passenger revenues accounted for 78.2 % of Ryanair's total revenues for the 
2013 fiscal year, compared with 79.8% of total revenues in the 2012 fiscal year.
 During fiscal year 2012, changes in estimates relating to the timing of revenue recognition for unused passenger 
tickets were made, resulting in increased revenue in the 2012 fiscal year of EUR65.3 million. This change reflects 
more accurate and timely data obtained through system enhancements.
 Ancillary revenues. Ryanair's ancillary revenues, which comprise revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, 
in-flight sales and Internet-related services, increased 20.1%, from EUR886.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year to 
EUR1,064.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year, while ancillary revenues per booked passenger increased to EUR13.43 
from EUR11.69. Revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, including revenues from excess baggage 
charges, administration/credit card fees, sales of rail and bus tickets, priority boarding, reserved seating, 
accommodation, travel insurance and car rental increased 23.0% to EUR832.9 million from 677.4 million in the 
2012 fiscal year. Revenues from in-flight sales increased 2. 8%, to EUR109.8 million from EUR106.7 million in the 
2012 fiscal year. Revenues from Internet-related services, primarily commissions received from products sold on 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -40-
Ryanair.com or linked websites, increased 19.0%, from EUR102.1 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR121.5 
million in the 2013 fiscal year. The rate of increase in revenues from all ancillary revenue categories exceeded that 
of the increase in overall passengers booked.
 The following table sets forth the components of ancillary revenues earned by Ryanair and each component 
expressed as a percentage of total ancillary revenues for each of the periods indicated:

Operating expenses. As a percentage of total revenues, Ryanair's operating expenses increased from 84.5% in the 
2012 fiscal year to 85.3% in the 2013 fiscal year, as total revenues increased by 11.2%, slower than the 12.4% 
increase in operating expenses. In absolute terms, total operating expenses increased 12.4%, from EUR3,707.0 
million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR4,165.8 million in the 2013 fiscal year, principally as a result of an 18.3% 
increase in fuel and oil costs from EUR1,593.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR1,885.6 million in the 2013 
fiscal year. Staff costs, depreciation, aircraft rental expenses, route charges, airport handling charges and 
marketing, distribution and other costs decreased as a percentage of total revenues, while maintenance and fuel 
and oil expenses increased. Total operating expenses per passenger increased by 7.5%, with the increase 
reflecting, principally, the increase in passenger capacity during the 2013 fiscal year and the impact of the higher 
fuel costs.
 The Company's decision to ground aircraft did not have a material impact on the results of the Company for the 
year ended March 31, 2013 and, at present, is not anticipated to have a material impact on future operations. The 
Company anticipates that any revenues which could have been generated had the Company operated the 
grounded aircraft would have been lower than the operating costs associated with operating these aircraft, due to 
significantly higher fuel costs, airport charges and taxes. The Company does not anticipate that any material staff 
costs will be incurred during future periods of the grounding of aircraft, as the relevant staff can be furloughed under 
the terms of their contracts without compensation and the maintenance costs associated with the grounded aircraft 
will be minimal. However, the Company will still incur aircraft ownership costs comprised of depreciation and 
amortization costs, lease rentals costs and financing costs.
 The following table sets forth the amounts in euro cent of, and percentage changes in, Ryanair's operating 
expenses (on a per-passenger basis) for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012 under IFRS. 
These data are calculated by dividing the relevant expense amount (as shown in the consolidated financial 
statements) by the number of booked passengers in the relevant year as shown in the table of "Selected Operating 
and Other Data" in Item 3 and rounding to the nearest euro cent; the percentage change is calculated on the basis 
of the relevant figures before rounding.

 In deciding which Affected Shares are to be selected as Restricted Shares, the directors can take into 
account which Affected Shares have given rise to the necessity to take action. Subject to that they will, 
insofar as practicable, firstly view as Restricted Shares those Affected Shares in respect of which no 
declaration as to whether or not such shares are Affected Shares has been made by the holder thereof and 
where information which has been requested by the directors in accordance with the Articles has not been 
provided within specified time periods and, secondly, have regard to the chronological order in which 
details of Affected Shares have been entered in the Separate Register and, accordingly, treat the most 
recently registered Affected Shares as Restricted Shares to the extent necessary. Transfers of Affected 
Shares to Affiliates (as that expression is defined in the Articles) will not affect the chronological 
order of entry in the Separate Register for this purpose. The directors do however have the discretion to 
apply another basis of selection if, in their sole opinion, that would be more equitable. Where the 
directors have resolved to treat Affected Shares held by any particular stockholder or stockholders as 
Restricted Shares (i) because such Affected Shares have given rise to the need to take such action or (ii) 
because of a change of law or a requirement or direction of a regulatory authority necessitating such 
action (see above), such powers may be exercised irrespective of the date upon which such Affected Shares 
were entered in the Separate Register.
 After having initially resolved to set the maximum level at 49.0%, the directors increased the maximum 
level to 49.9% on May 26, 1999, after the number of Affected Shares exceeded the initial limit. This 
maximum level could be reduced if it becomes necessary for the directors to exercise these powers in the 
circumstances described above. The decision to make any such reduction or to change the Permitted Maximum 
from time to time will be published in at least one national newspaper in Ireland and in any country in 
which the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are listed. The relevant notice will specify the provisions of the 
Articles that apply to Restricted Shares and the name of the person or persons who will answer queries 
relating to Restricted Shares on behalf of Ryanair Holdings. The directors shall publish information as to 
the number of shares held by EU nationals annually.
 In an effort to increase the percentage of its share capital held by EU nationals, on June 26, 2001, 
Ryanair Holdings instructed the Depositary to suspend the issuance of new ADSs in exchange for the deposit 
of Ordinary Shares until further notice to its shareholders. Holders of Ordinary Shares cannot convert 
their Ordinary Shares into ADRs during such suspension, and there can be no assurance that the suspension 
will ever be lifted.
 As a further measure to increase the percentage of Ordinary Shares held by EU nationals, on February 7, 
2002, the Company issued a notice to shareholders to the effect that any purchase of Ordinary Shares by a 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -56-
non-EU national after such date will immediately result in the issue of a Restricted Share Notice to such 
non-EU national Purchaser. The Restricted Share Notice compels the non-EU national purchaser to sell the 
Affected Shares to an EU national within 21 days of the date of issuance. In the event that any such non-
EU national shareholder does not sell its Ordinary Shares to an EU national within the specified time 
period, the Company can then take legal action to compel such a sale. As a result, non-EU nationals are 
effectively barred from purchasing Ordinary Shares for as long as these restrictions remain in place. 
There can be no assurance that these restrictions will ever be lifted.
 As an additional measure, to ensure the percentage of shares held by EU nationals remains at least 50.1%, 
at the extraordinary general meeting held on April 19, 2012, the Company obtained a new repurchase 
authority which will enable the repurchase of ADRs for up to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company 
traded on the NASDAQ. This authority was renewed at the Annual General Meeting held on September 20, 2013.
 Concerns about the foreign ownership restrictions described above could result in the exclusion of 
Ryanair from certain stock tracking indices. Any such exclusion may adversely affect the market price of 
the Ordinary Shares and ADRs. See also "Item 3. Risk Factors--Risks Related to Ownership of the Company's 
Shares or ADRs-EU Rules Impose Restrictions on the Ownership of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares by Non-
EU Nationals and the Company has Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals" 
above.
 As of June 30, 2014, EU nationals owned at least 52.8% of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares (assuming 
conversion of all outstanding ADRs into Ordinary Shares). Ryanair continuously monitors the ownership 
status of its Ordinary Shares, which changes on a daily basis.
 TAXATION
 Irish Tax Considerations
 The following is a discussion of certain Irish tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and 
disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADSs. This discussion is based upon tax laws and practice of Ireland at 
the date of this document, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Particular rules 
may apply to certain classes of taxpayers (such as dealers in securities) and this discussion does not 
purport to deal with the tax consequences of purchase, ownership or disposition of the relevant securities 
for all categories of investors.
 The discussion is intended only as a general guide based on current Irish law and practice and is not 
intended to be, nor should it be considered to be, legal or tax advice to any particular investor or 
stockholder. Accordingly, current stockholders or potential investors should satisfy themselves as to the 
overall tax consequences by consulting their own tax advisers.
 Dividends. If Ryanair Holdings pays dividends or makes other relevant distributions, the following is 
relevant:
 Withholding Tax. Unless exempted, a withholding at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%) will 
apply to dividends or other relevant distributions paid by an Irish resident company. The withholding tax 
requirement will not apply to distributions paid to certain categories of Irish resident stockholders or 
to distributions paid to certain categories of non-resident stockholders.
 The following Irish resident stockholders are exempt from withholding if they make to the Company, in 
advance of payment of any relevant distribution, an appropriate declaration of entitlement to exemption:
 --      Irish resident companies;
 --      Pension schemes approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners ("Irish Revenue");
 --      Qualifying fund managers or qualifying savings managers;
 --      Personal Retirement Savings Account ("PRSA") administrators who receive the relevant distribution 
as income arising in respect of PRSA assets;
 --      Qualifying employee share ownership trusts;
 --      Collective investment undertakings;
 --      Tax-exempt charities;
 --      Designated brokers receiving the distribution for special portfolio investment accounts;
 --      Any person who is entitled to exemption from income tax under Schedule F on dividends in respect 
of an investment in whole or in part of payments received in respect of a civil action or from the 
Personal Injuries Assessment Board for damages in respect of mental or physical infirmity;
 --      Certain qualifying trusts established for the benefit of an incapacitated individual and/or 
persons in receipt of income from such a qualifying trust;
 --      Any person entitled to exemption to income tax under Schedule F by virtue of Section 192(2) Taxes 
Consolidation Act ("TCA") 1997;
 --      Unit trusts to which Section 731(5)(a) TCA 1997 applies; and
 --      Certain Irish Revenue-approved amateur and athletic sport bodies.
 The following non-resident stockholders are exempt from withholding if they make to the Company, in 
advance of payment of any dividend, an appropriate declaration of entitlement to exemption:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -56-
 --      Persons (other than a company) who (i) are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland 
and (ii) are resident for tax purposes in (a) a country which has signed a tax treaty with Ireland (a "tax 
treaty country") or (b) an EU member state other than Ireland;
 --      Companies not resident in Ireland which are resident in an EU member state or a tax treaty 
country, by virtue of the law of an EU member state or a tax treaty country and are not controlled, 
directly or indirectly, by Irish residents;
 --      Companies not resident in Ireland which are directly or indirectly controlled by a person or 
persons who are, by virtue of the law of a tax treaty country or an EU member state, resident for tax 
purposes in a tax treaty country or an EU member state other than Ireland and which are not controlled 
directly or indirectly by persons who are not resident for tax purposes in a tax treaty country or EU 
member state;
 --      Companies not resident in Ireland the principal class of shares of which is substantially and 
regularly traded on a recognized stock exchange in a tax treaty country or an EU member state including 
Ireland or on an approved stock exchange; or
 --      Companies not resident in Ireland that are 75% subsidiaries of a single company, or are wholly-
owned by two or more companies, in either case the principal classes of shares of which is or are 
substantially and regularly traded on a recognized stock exchange in a tax treaty country or an EU member 
state including Ireland or on an approved stock exchange.

The "Basic Price" (equivalent to a standard list price for an aircraft of this type) for each aircraft governed by the 
2013 Boeing contract will be increased by (a) an estimated U.S.$2.9 million per aircraft for certain "buyer furnished" 
equipment the Company has asked Boeing to purchase and install on each of the aircraft, and (b) an "Escalation 
Factor" designed to increase the Basic Price, as defined in the purchase agreement, of any individual aircraft by 
applying a formula which reflects increases in the published U.S. Employment Cost and Producer Price indices 
between the time the Basic Price was set and the period of 18 to 24 months prior to the delivery of such aircraft.
 Boeing has granted Ryanair certain price concessions with regard to the Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft 
as part of the Boeing 2013 Contract. These take the form of credit memoranda to the Company for the amount of 
such concessions, which the Company may apply toward the purchase of goods and services from Boeing or 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -91-
toward certain payments, other than advance payments, in respect of the purchase of the aircraft under the various 
Boeing contracts.
 Boeing and CFMI (the manufacturer of the engines to be fitted on the purchased aircraft) have also agreed to give 
the Company certain allowances in addition to providing other goods and services to the Company on 
concessionary terms. These credit memoranda and allowances will effectively reduce the price of each aircraft to 
the Company. As a result, the effective price of each aircraft (the purchase price of the new aircraft net of discounts 
received from Boeing) will be significantly below the Basic Price mentioned above. At March 31, 2014, the total 
potential commitment to acquire all 175 "firm" aircraft, not taking such increases and decreases into account, will be 
approximately U.S. $13.8 billion.  At March 31, 2013, the total potential commitment was U.S. $13.8 billion to 
acquire all 175 "firm" aircraft.
 Operating leases
 The Company financed 76 of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between December 2003 and March 2014 
under seven-year, sale-and-leaseback arrangements with a number of international leasing companies, pursuant to 
which each lessor purchased an aircraft and leased it to Ryanair under an operating lease. Between October 2010 
and December 2012, 17 operating lease aircraft were returned to the lessor at the agreed maturity date of the 
lease. At March 31, 2014 Ryanair had 51 operating lease aircraft in the fleet. As a result, Ryanair operates, but 
does not own, these aircraft. Ryanair has no right or obligation to acquire these aircraft at the end of the relevant 
lease terms. 18  of these leases are denominated in euro and require Ryanair to make fixed rental payments over 
the term of the leases. 33 remaining operating leases are U.S. dollar-denominated which require Ryanair to make 
fixed rental payments. The Company has an option to extend the initial period of seven years on 34 of the 51 
remaining operating lease aircraft as at March 31, 2014, on pre-determined terms.  This includes 3 operating lease 
arrangements which are due to mature during the year ended March 31, 2015 but have been extended for a further 
7 years. The following table sets out the total future minimum payments of leasing 51 aircraft (2013: 59 aircraft; 
2012: 59 aircraft), ignoring movement in interest rates, foreign currency and hedging arrangements, at March 31, 
2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively:

Finance leases
 The Company financed 30 Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between March 2005 and March 2014 with 13-year 
euro-denominated Japanese Operating Leases with Call Options ("JOLCOs"). These structures are accounted for 
as finance leases and are initially recorded at fair value in the Company's balance sheet. Under each of these 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -91-
contracts, Ryanair has a call option to purchase the aircraft at a pre-determined price after a period of 10.5 years, 
which it may exercise.
 The following table sets out the total future minimum payments of leasing 30 aircraft (2013: 30 aircraft; 2012: 30

(c)           Share options and share purchase arrangements
 The Company has adopted a number of share option plans, which allow current or future employees or 
executive directors to purchase shares in the Company up to an aggregate of approximately 5% (when 
aggregated with other ordinary shares over which options are granted and which have not yet been 
exercised) of the outstanding ordinary shares of Ryanair Holdings plc, subject to certain conditions. All 
grants are subject to approval by the Remuneration Committee. These are exercisable at a price equal to 
the market price of the ordinary shares at the time options are granted. The key terms of these option 
plans include the requirement that certain employees remain in employment with the Company for a specified 
period of time and that the Company achieves certain net profit targets and/or share price targets. These 
share options schemes are cash settled.

Body
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR221.2 million at March 31, 2013 to 
EUR260.3 million at March 31, 2014 is comprised of a gain of EUR39.1 million, recognised through other 
comprehensive income, reflecting the increase in the share price of Aer Lingus from EUR1.39 per share at 
March 31, 2013 to approximately EUR1.64 per share at March 31, 2014.
 This investment is classified as available-for-sale, rather than as an investment in an associate, 
because the Company does not have control or the power to exercise "material influence" over the entity. 
The Company's determination that it does not have control, or even exercise a "significant influence" over 
Aer Lingus through its minority shareholding has been based on the following factors, in particular:
 --      Ryanair does not have any representation on the Aer Lingus Board of Directors, nor does it have a 
right to appoint a director;
 --      Ryanair does not participate in Aer Lingus' policy-making decisions, nor does it have a right to 
participate in such policy-making decisions;
 --      There are no material transactions between Ryanair and Aer Lingus, there is no interchange of 
personnel between the two companies and there is no sharing of technical information between the 
companies;
 --      Aer Lingus and its significant shareholder (the Irish government: 25.1%) have openly opposed 
Ryanair's investment or participation in the company;
 --      In August 2007, September 2007 and November/December 2011, Aer Lingus refused Ryanair's attempt 
to assert its statutory right to requisition a general meeting (a legal right of any 10% shareholder under 
Irish law);
 --      On April 15, 2011, the High Court in Dublin ruled that Aer Lingus was not obliged to accede to 
Ryanair's request that two additional resolutions (on the payment of a dividend and on payments to pension 
schemes) be put to vote at Aer Lingus' annual general meeting;
 --      The European Commission has formally found that Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus does not 
grant Ryanair "de jure or de facto control of Aer Lingus" and that "Ryanair's rights as a minority 
shareholder are associated exclusively to rights related to the protection of minority shareholders" 
(Commission Decision Case No. COMP/M.4439 dated October 11, 2007). The European Commission's finding has 
been confirmed by the European Union's General Court which issued a decision on July 6, 2010 that the 
European Commission was justified to use the required legal and factual standard in its refusal to order 
Ryanair to divest its minority shareholding in Aer Lingus and that, as part of that decision, Ryanair's 
shareholding did not confer control of Aer Lingus (Judgment of the General Court (Third Chamber) Case No. 
T-411/07 dated July 6, 2010); and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -71-
 --      On February 27, 2013 the European Commission prohibited Ryanair's bid made on June 19, 2012, to 
acquire the entire share capital of Aer Lingus on the claimed basis that it would be incompatible with the 
EU internal market.  Ryanair appealed this decision to the EU General Court on May 8, 2013. The judgment 
of the EU General Court is expected in 2015 and may affirm or annul the decision of the European 
Commission.
 Following the European Commission's decision to prohibit its offer for Aer Lingus, Ryanair actively 
engaged with the Competition Commission's investigation of the minority stake. On August 28, 2013, the UK 
Competition Commission (UKCC) issued its final decision in which it found that Ryanair's shareholding 
"gave it the ability to exercise material influence over Aer Lingus" and "had led, or may be expected to 
lead, to a substantial lessening of competition in the markets for air passenger services between Great 
Britain and Ireland". As a result of its findings, the UKCC ordered Ryanair to reduce its shareholding in 
Aer Lingus to below 5 per cent of Aer Lingus' issued ordinary shares.  Ryanair appealed the UKCC's final 
decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) on September 23, 2013. The CAT rejected Ryanair's appeal 
on March 7, 2014. On April 3, 2014, Ryanair applied for permission to appeal the CAT's judgment to the UK 
Court of Appeal. Should Ryanair's permission to appeal, the appeal itself or any subsequent appeal to the 
UK Supreme Court be refused, Ryanair could suffer losses due to the negative impact on market prices of 
the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares. Ryanair believes that the enforcement 
of any such decision should be delayed until the outcome of Ryanair's appeal against the European 
Commission's February 2013 prohibition decision of Ryanair's 2012 offer for Aer Lingus, and the conclusion 
of any appeals against the UKCC's decision in the UK courts. However, it is possible that the UKCC will 
seek to enforce any such sell-down remedy at an earlier date.
 5              Derivative financial instruments
 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has responsibility for monitoring the treasury policies and 
objectives of the Company, which include controls over the procedures used to manage the main financial 
risks arising from the Company's operations. Such risks comprise commodity price, foreign exchange and 
interest rate risks. The Company uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks. 
These instruments include borrowings, cash deposits and derivatives (principally jet fuel derivatives, 
interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts). It is the 
Company's policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments takes place.
 The Company's historical fuel risk management policy has been to hedge between 70% and 90% of the 
forecast rolling annual volumes required to ensure that the future cost per gallon of fuel is locked in. 
This policy was adopted to prevent the Company being exposed, in the short term, to adverse movements in 
global jet fuel prices. However, when deemed to be in the best interests of the Company, it may deviate 
from this policy. At March 31, 2014, the Company had hedged approximately 90% of its estimated fuel 
exposure for the year ending March 31, 2015. At March 31, 2013, the Company had hedged approximately 90% 
of its estimated fuel exposure for the year ending March 31, 2014. At March 31, 2012, the Company had 
hedged approximately 90% of its estimated fuel exposure for the year ending March 31, 2013.
 Foreign currency risk in relation to the Company's trading operations largely arises in relation to non-
euro currencies. These currencies are primarily U.K. pounds sterling and the U.S. dollar. The Company 
manages this risk by matching U.K. pounds sterling revenues against U.K. pounds sterling costs. Surplus 
U.K. pounds sterling revenues are sometimes used to fund forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge U.S. 
dollar currency exposures that arise in relation to fuel, maintenance, aviation insurance, and capital 
expenditure costs and excess U.K. pounds sterling are converted into euro. Additionally, the Company swaps 
euro for U.S. dollars using forward currency contracts to cover any expected U.S. dollar outflows for 
these costs. From time to time, the Company also swaps euro for U.K. pounds sterling using forward 
currency contracts to hedge expected future surplus U.K. pounds sterling. From time to time the Company 
also enters into cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange 
rates and interest rates in respect of U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.
 The Company's objective for interest rate risk management is to reduce interest-rate risk through a 
combination of financial instruments, which lock in interest rates on debt and by matching a proportion of 
floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities. In addition, the Company aims to achieve the best 
available return on investments of surplus cash - subject to credit risk and liquidity constraints. Credit 
risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty based on 
third-party market-based ratings. In line with the above interest rate risk management strategy, the 
Company has entered into a series of interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates 
for certain floating rate financial arrangements and certain other obligations. The Company has also 
entered into floating rate financing for certain aircraft, which is matched with floating rate deposits. 
Additionally, certain cash deposits have been set aside as collateral for the counterparty's exposure to 
risk of fluctuations on certain derivative and other financing arrangements with Ryanair (restricted 
cash). At March 31, 2014, such restricted cash amounted to EUR13.3 million (2013: EUR24.7 million; 2012: 
EUR35.1 million). Additional numerical information on these swaps and on other derivatives held by the 
Company is set out below and in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -71-
 The Company utilises a range of derivatives designed to mitigate these risks. All of the above 
derivatives have been accounted for at fair value in the Company's balance sheet and have been utilised to 
hedge against these particular risks arising in the normal course of the Company's business. All have been 
designated as hedging derivatives for the purposes of IAS 39 and are fully set out below.

 Ryanair recognises the importance of communications with shareholders. Ryanair communicates with all of 
its shareholders following the release of quarterly and annual results directly via road shows, investor 
days and/or by conference calls. The Chief Executive, senior financial, operational, and commercial 
management participate in these events.
 During the year ended March 31, 2014 the Company held discussions with a substantial number of 
institutional investors.
 The Board is kept informed of the views of shareholders through the executive director's and executive 
management's attendance at investor presentations and results presentations. Furthermore, relevant 
feedback from such meetings and investor relations analyst reports are provided to the entire Board on a 
regular basis. In addition, the Board determines, on a case by case basis, specific issues where it would 
be appropriate for the Chairman and/or Senior Independent Director to communicate directly with 
shareholders or to indicate that they are available to communicate if shareholders so wish. If any of the 
non-executive directors wishes to attend meetings with major shareholders, arrangements are made 
accordingly.
 General Meetings
 All shareholders are given adequate notice of the AGM at which the Chairman reviews the results and 
comments on current business activity. Financial, operational and other information on the Company is 
provided on our website at www.ryanair.com.
 Ryanair will continue to propose a separate resolution at the AGM on each substantially separate issue, 
including a separate resolution relating to the Directors' Report and financial statements. In order to 
comply with the 2012 Code, proxy votes will be announced at the AGM, following each vote on a show of 
hands, except in the event of a poll being called. The Board Chairman and the Chairmen of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees are available to answer questions from all shareholders.
 The Chief Executive makes a presentation at the Annual General Meeting on the Group's business and its 
performance during the prior year and answers questions from shareholders. The AGM affords shareholders 
the opportunity to question the Chairman and the Board.
 All holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to attend, speak and vote at general meetings of the Company, 
subject to limitations described under note "Limitations on the Right to Own Shares" on page 127. In 
accordance with Irish company law, the Company specifies record dates for general meetings, by which date 
shareholders must be registered in the Register of Members of the Company to be entitled to attend.  
Record dates are specified in the notes to the Notice convening the meeting.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -9-
 Shareholders may exercise their right to vote by appointing a proxy/proxies, by electronic means or in 
writing, to vote some or all of their shares. The requirements for the receipt of valid proxy forms are 
set out in the notes to the Notice convening the Meeting.
 A shareholder or group of shareholders, holding at least 5% of the issued share capital has the right to 
requisition a general meeting. A shareholder, or a group of shareholders, holding at least 3% of the 
issued share capital of the Company, has the right to put an item on the agenda of an AGM or to table a 
draft resolution for an item on the agenda of the general meeting provided that such item is accompanied 
by reasons justifying its inclusion or the full text of any draft resolution proposed to be adopted at the 
general meeting. A request by a member to put an item on the agenda or to table a draft resolution shall 
be received by the company in hardcopy form or in electronic form at least 42 days before the AGM to which 
it relates.
 Notice of the Annual General Meeting and the Form of Proxy are sent to shareholders at least twenty-one 
working days before the meeting. The Company's Annual Report is available on the Company's website,       
     www.ryanair.com. The 2014 Annual General Meeting will be held at 9a.m. on September 25, 2014 in the 
Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport, Co Dublin, Ireland.
 All general meetings other than the Annual General Meeting are called Extraordinary General Meetings 
(EGMs). An EGM must be called by giving at least twenty-one clear days' notice. Except in relation to an 
adjourned meeting, three members, present in person or by proxy, entitled to vote upon the business to be 
transacted, shall be a quorum. The passing of resolutions at a general meeting, other than special 
resolution, requires a simple majority. To be passed, a special resolution requires a majority of at least 
75% of the votes cast. Votes may be given in person by a show of hands, or by proxy.
 At the Meeting, after each resolution has been dealt with, details are given of the level of proxy votes 
cast on each resolution and the numbers for, against and withheld.  This information is made available on 
the Company's website following the meeting.
 Risk Management and Internal Control
 The directors have overall responsibility for the Company's system of risk management and internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the system 
of risk management and internal control which is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
 In accordance with the revised FRC (Turnbull) guidance for directors on internal control published in 
October 2005, 'Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code', the Board confirms 
that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing any significant risks faced by 
the Group, that it has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the 
financial statements and that this process is regularly reviewed by the Board.
 In accordance with the provisions of the 2012 Code the directors review the effectiveness of the 
Company's system of internal control including:
 --      Financial
 --      Operational
 --      Compliance
 --      Risk Management
 The Board is ultimately responsible for the Company's system of risk management and internal controls and 
for monitoring its effectiveness. The key procedures that have been established to provide effective risk 
management and internal control include:
 --   a strong and independent Board which meets at least 4 times a year and has separate Chief Executive 
and Chairman roles;
 --   a clearly defined organisational structure along functional lines and a clear division of 
responsibility and authority in the Company;
 --   a comprehensive system of internal financial reporting which includes preparation of detailed 
monthly management accounts, providing key performance indicators and financial results for each major 
function within the Company;
 --   preparation and issue of financial reports to shareholders and the markets, including the Annual 
Report and consolidated financial statements, is overseen by the Audit Committee. The Company's financial 
reporting process is controlled using documented accounting policies and reporting formats, supplemented 
by detailed instructions and guidance on reporting requirements. The Company's processes support the 
integrity and quality of data, including appropriate segregation of duties. The financial information of 
the parent entity and all subsidiary entities, which form the basis for the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements are subject to scrutiny by Group level senior management. The Company's 
financial reports, financial guidance, and Annual Report and consolidated financial statements are also 
reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board in advance of being presented to the full Board for their 
review and approval;
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -9-
 --   quarterly reporting of the financial performance with a management discussion and analysis of 
results;
 --   weekly Management Committee meetings, comprising of heads of departments, to review the performance 
and activities of each department in the Company;
 --   detailed budgetary process which includes identifying risks and opportunities and which is 
ultimately approved at Board level;
 --   Board approved capital expenditure and Audit Committee approved treasury policies which clearly 
define authorisation limits and procedures;
 --   an internal audit function which reviews key financial/business processes and controls, and which 
has full and unrestricted access to the Audit Committee;
 --   an Audit Committee which approves audit plans, considers significant control matters raised by 
management and the internal and external auditors and which is actively monitoring the Company's 
compliance with section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002;
 --   established systems and procedures to identify, control and report on key risks. Exposure to these 
risks is monitored by the Audit Committee and the Management Committee; and
 --   a risk management programme in place throughout the Company whereby executive management reviews and 
monitors the controls in place, both financial and non financial, to manage the risks facing the business.
 On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Company's system of 
risk management and internal control for the year ended March 31, 2014 and has reported thereon to the 
Board.
 The Board has delegated to executive management the planning and implementation of the systems of 
internal control within an established framework which applies throughout the Company.
 Takeover Bids Directive
 Information regarding rights and obligations attached to shares are set forth in Note 15 on pages 185 to 
186 of the consolidated financial statements.
 Shares in the Ryanair employee share schemes carry no control rights and shares are only issued (and gain 
voting rights) when options are exercised by employees.

Body
 Ryanair's Articles of Association do not contain any restrictions on voting rights. However, there are 
provisions in the Articles which allow the directors to (amongst other things) suspend the voting rights 
of a share if the Board believes the number of non-qualifying nationals holding shares in Ryanair would 
put it in breach of the Air Navigation Acts and licences and permits which allow it to operate. This is 
not an absolute restriction and can only occur if the Board designates a number of shares to be so 
restricted.
 Ryanair has not received any notifications from shareholders (as shareholders are obliged to do) 
regarding any agreements between shareholders which might result in restrictions on the transfer of 
shares.
 Details of the rules concerning the removal and appointment of the directors are set out above as part of 
this Directors' Report. There are no specific rules regarding the amendment of the Company's Articles of 
Association.
 Details of the Company's share buy-back programme are set forth on page 121 of the Annual Report. The 
shareholders approved the power of the Company to buy back shares at the 2006 AGM and at subsequent AGM's.
 None of the significant agreements to which the Company is party to, contain change of control 
provisions. As referred to above in this Director's Report, Michael O'Leary's employment agreement does 
not contain provisions providing for compensation on his termination.
 Going Concern
 After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgment, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The directors' responsibility for 
preparing the financial statements is explained on page 30 and the reporting responsibilities of the 
auditors are set out in their report on page 32.
 Compliance Statement
 Ryanair has complied, throughout the year ended March 31, 2014, with the provisions set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the requirements set out in the Irish Corporate Governance Annex except as 
outlined below. The Group has not complied with the following provisions of the 2012 Code, but continues 
to review these situations on an ongoing basis:
 --   A number of non-executive directors participate in the Company's share option plans. The 2012 Code 
requires that, if exceptionally, share options are granted to non-executive directors that shareholder 
approval should be sought in advance and any shares acquired by exercise of the options should be held 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -10-
until at least one year after the non-executive director leaves the board. In accordance with the 2012 
Code, the Company sought and received shareholder approval to make certain stock option grants to its non-
executive directors and as described above, the Board believes the quantum of options granted to non-
executive directors is not so significant to impair their independence.
 --   Certain non-executive directors, namely Messrs. David Bonderman, James Osborne, Kyran McLaughlin and 
Michael Horgan have each served more than nine years on the Board without being offered for annual re-
election. As described further above, given the other significant commercial and professional commitments 
of these non-executive directors, and taking into account that their independence is considered annually 
by the Board, the Board does not consider their independence to be impaired in this regard.

the Annual Report.
 The role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are set out in its written terms of 
reference, which are available on the Company's website www.ryanair.com.
 All members of the Remuneration Committee have access to the advice of the Chief Executive and may, in 
the furtherance of their duties, obtain independent professional advice at the Company's expense.
 Remuneration Policy
 The remuneration policy of the Company is to ensure that the executive director and the senior key

executive team reporting to the Board of Directors) are set out in Note 27 of the consolidated Financial 
Statements.
 Non-Executive Directors

Financial Statements.
 Directors can only be appointed following selection by the Nomination Committee and approval by the Board 
and must be elected by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting following their appointment. 
Ryanair's Articles of Association require that all directors retire after a fixed period not exceeding 
three years. Directors can then offer themselves for re-election at the Company's Annual General Meeting.
 None of the non-executive directors hold a service agreement with the Company that provides for benefits 
upon termination.
 Executive Director
 The Chief Executive of the Company is the only executive director on the Board. Details of the 
remuneration paid to the Chief Executive are set out in Note 19(a) to the consolidated Financial 
Statements.
 The Company entered into an employment agreement with the Chief Executive on July 1, 2002 for a one year 
period to June 30, 2003. Thereafter, the agreement continues for successive annual periods but may be 
terminated with 12 months notice by either party. This employment agreement does not contain provisions 
providing for compensation on its termination.
 Performance Related Bonuses

Company are set forth in Note 19(d) to the consolidated Financial Statements.
 Statement of Directors' Responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements
 The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the consolidated and Company financial 
statements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -10-
 Company law requires the directors to prepare consolidated and Company financial statements for each 
financial year.  Under that law, the directors are required to prepare the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU) and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2013. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements the directors have also elected to comply with IFRSs as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
 The consolidated and Company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU, to 
present fairly the financial position of the Group and the Company and the performance of the Group.  The 
Companies Acts, 1963 to 2013 provide in relation to such financial statements that references in the 
relevant part of these Acts to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their 
achieving a fair presentation.
 In preparing each of the consolidated and Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 --   select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 --   makejudgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 --   state that the financial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the EU as applied in accordance 
with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2013 and IFRSs as issued by the IASB; and
 --   prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group and the Company will continue in business.
 Under applicable law and the requirements of the Listing Rules issued by the Irish Stock Exchange, the 
directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors' Report and reports relating to directors' 
remuneration and corporate governance that comply with that law and those Rules. In particular, in 
accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (the Transparency Regulations), 
the directors are required to include in their report a fair review of the business and a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group and Company and a responsibility statement relating 
to those and other matters, included below.

 Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provisions for 
impairments, if any. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Cost may 
also include transfers from other comprehensive income of any gain or loss on qualifying cash-flow hedges of 
foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost,

 23 years from   15% of current market
 Boeing 737-800s         246(a)            date of       value of new
 aircraft, determined
 manufacture     periodically
(a)    The Company operated 297 aircraft as of March 31, 2014, of which 51 were leased.
 The Company's estimate of the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values is 15% of current market 
value of new aircraft, determined periodically, based on independent valuations and actual aircraft 
disposals during prior periods.
 An element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed on acquisition to its service potential, 
reflecting the maintenance condition of its engines and airframe. This cost, which can equate to a 
substantial element of the total aircraft cost, is amortised over the shorter of the period to the next 
maintenance check (usually between 8 and 12 years for Boeing 737-800 aircraft) or the remaining life of 
the aircraft. The costs of subsequent major airframe and engine maintenance checks are capitalised and 
amortised over the shorter of the period to the next check or the remaining life of the aircraft.
 Advance and option payments made in respect of aircraft purchase commitments and options to acquire 
aircraft are recorded at cost and separately disclosed within property, plant and equipment. On 
acquisition of the related aircraft, these payments are included as part of the cost of aircraft and are 
depreciated from that date.
 Rotable spare parts held by the Company are classified as property, plant and equipment if they are 
expected to be used over more than one period.
 Gains and losses on disposal of items of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the 
proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised on a 
net basis within other income/(expenses) in profit or loss.
 Aircraft maintenance costs
 The accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks for owned 
aircraft is described in the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment.
 For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, Ryanair is contractually committed to either return 
the aircraft in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the 
airframe, engines and life-limited parts upon return. In order to fulfill such conditions of the lease, 
maintenance, in the form of major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major 
life-limited parts, is required to be performed during the period of the lease and upon return of the 
aircraft to the lessor. The estimated airframe and engine maintenance costs and the costs associated with 
the restitution of major life-limited parts, are accrued and charged to profit or loss over the lease term 
for this contractual obligation, based on the present value of the estimated future cost of the major 
airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major life-limited parts, calculated by 
reference to the number of hours flown or cycles operated during the year.
 Ryanair's aircraft operating lease agreements typically have a term of seven years, which closely 
correlates with the timing of heavy maintenance checks. The contractual obligation to maintain and 
replenish aircraft held under operating lease exists independently of any future actions within the 
control of Ryanair.  While Ryanair may, in very limited circumstances, sub-lease its aircraft, it remains 
fully liable to perform all of its contractual obligations under the 'head lease' notwithstanding any such 
sub-leasing.
 All other maintenance costs, other than major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and 
restitution of major life-limited parts costs associated with leased aircraft, are expensed as incurred.
 Intangible assets - landing rights
 Intangible assets acquired are recognised to the extent it is considered probable that expected future 
benefits will flow to the Company and the associated costs can be measured reliably. Landing rights 
acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at that date and are not 
amortised, where those rights are considered to be indefinite. The carrying values of those rights are 
reviewed for impairment at each reporting date and are subject to impairment testing when events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable. No impairment to the 
carrying values of the Company's intangible assets has been recorded to date.
 Available-for-sale securities
 The Company holds certain equity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, and are measured 
at fair value, less incremental direct costs, on initial recognition. Such securities are classified as 
available-for-sale, rather than as an investment in an associate if the Company does not have the power to 
exercise significant influence over the investee. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at 
fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses, are recognised in other comprehensive income 
and reflected in shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet. Fair value losses, subsequent to 
any impairments are recognised in other comprehensive income against net cumulative gains in the reserve.  
Fair value losses below the impaired value are recognised in the income statement. The fair values of 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -67-
available-for-sale securities are determined by reference to quoted prices in active markets at each 
reporting date. When an investment is de-recognised the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive 
income is transferred to the income statement.
 Such securities are considered to be impaired if there is objective evidence which indicates that events 
have occurred that can reasonably be expected to adversely affect the future cash flows of the securities, 
such that the future cash flows do not support the current fair value of the securities. This includes 
where there is a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost. All impairment losses 
are recognised in the income statement and any cumulative loss in respect of an available-for-sale asset 
recognised previously in other comprehensive income is also transferred to the income statement.
 Other financial assets
 Other financial assets (other than available-for-sale financial assets) comprise cash deposits of greater 
than three months' maturity. All amounts are categorised as loans and receivables and are carried 
initially at fair value and then subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method in 
the balance sheet.
 Derivative financial instruments
 Ryanair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and 
currency exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Ryanair is to minimise the impact 
of commodity price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Company's earnings, cash 
flows and equity.
 To manage these risks, Ryanair uses various derivative financial instruments, including interest rate 
swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and commodity contracts. These derivative financial instruments 
are generally held to maturity. The Company enters into these arrangements with the goal of hedging its 
operational and balance sheet risk. However, Ryanair's exposure to commodity price, interest rate and 
currency exchange rate fluctuations cannot be neutralised completely.
 Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, derivative financial instruments continue to be re-measured to fair value, and changes 
therein are accounted for as described below.

Body
 In September 2005, the European Commission announced new guidelines on the financing of airports and the 
provision of start-up aid to airlines departing from regional airports, based on the European Commission's finding in 
the Brussels (Charleroi) case, which Ryanair successfully appealed. The guidelines applied only to publicly owned 
regional airports, and placed restrictions on the incentives these airports could offer airlines to deliver traffic. The 
guidelines applied only in cases in which the terms offered by a public airport are in excess of what a similar private 
airport would have offered. Ryanair deals with airports, both public and private, on an equal basis and receives the 
same cost agreements from both. The guidelines have therefore had no impact on Ryanair's business, although 
they have caused significant uncertainty in the industry in relation to what public airports may or may not do in order 
to attract traffic.
 Ryanair believes that the positive decision by the CFI in the Brussels (Charleroi) case has caused the European 
Commission to rethink its policy in this area, and that the revised guidelines, published by the European 
Commission in April 2014, will provide more certainty in the industry as to how public airports may deal with airlines 
in offering incentives for traffic growth. However, adverse rulings in the above or similar cases could be used as 
precedents by other competitors to challenge Ryanair's agreements with other publicly owned airports and could 
cause Ryanair to strongly reconsider its growth strategy in relation to public or state-owned airports across Europe. 
This could in turn lead to a scaling back of Ryanair's growth strategy due to the smaller number of privately owned 
airports available for development. No assurance can be given as to the outcome of these proceedings, nor as to 
whether any unfavorable outcomes may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
results of operations or financial condition of the Company.
 In November 2007, Ryanair initiated proceedings in the CFI against the European Commission for its failure to take 
action on a number of state aid complaints Ryanair had submitted against Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia, Volare 
and Olympic Airways. Following the European Commission's subsequent findings that illegal state aid had been 
provided to Air France and Olympic Airways, Ryanair withdrew the two relevant proceedings. The case related to 
Lufthansa concluded with the EU General Court's ruling in May 2011, in which the Court found that while the 
European Commission has not failed to act, it has unreasonably delayed the launch of the investigation, which 
justified Ryanair's action for failure to act. Consequently, the Court ordered the European Commission to pay 50% 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -49-
of Ryanair's costs in the proceedings. Similarly, in October 2011, the General Court found that the European 
Commission has failed to act on Ryanair's 2005-2006 complaints against state aid to Alitalia. The European 
Commission appealed the ruling to the Court of Justice of the European Union, and on May 16, 2013, the European 
Commission's appeal was rejected.
 In November 2008, Ryanair initiated proceedings in the CFI contesting the European Commission's refusal to grant 
Ryanair access to documents relating to the European Commission's state aid investigations at Hamburg (Lubeck), 
Tampere, Berlin (Schonefeld), Alghero, Pau, Aarhus, Bratislava and Frankfurt (Hahn) airports. These cases were 
heard on July 7, 2010 and a judgment was issued in December 2010. The CFI found that the European 
Commission had acted in line with applicable legislation, which highlighted the unfairness inherent in state aid 
procedures in the EU, whereby alleged beneficiaries of aid have no right of access to the European Commission's 
files and therefore cannot properly exercise their rights to defense and good administration. The CFI ordered the 
European Commission to pay Ryanair's costs in three of the eight access to documents cases.
 As a result of rising airport charges and the introduction of an Air Travel Tax, in March 2009, of EUR10 on 
passengers departing from Irish airports on routes longer than 300 kilometers from Dublin Airport (EUR2 on shorter 
routes), Ryanair reduced its fleet at Dublin airport to 13 during winter 2010 (down from 22 in summer 2008 and 20 
in winter 2008). Ryanair also complained to the European Commission about the unlawful differentiation in the level 
of the Irish Air Travel tax between routes within the EU. From April 2011, a single rate (EUR3) of the Air Travel Tax 
was introduced on all routes (and subsequently eliminated entirely in April 2014). In July 2012 the European 
Commission found that Ryanair, Aer Lingus and Aer Arann had received state aid from the Irish government by way 
of a two-tier air travel tax levied on passengers departing from Irish airports. Ryanair appealed this decision and a 
hearing in the EU General Court took place in June 2014 and judgment is expected within six months of the 
hearing. Also in July 2012, Ryanair issued proceedings before the Irish courts seeking repayment of the entire 
amount of the air travel tax paid by Ryanair during the period (EUR87.8 million) where it was two-tier on the basis of 
its illegality. In April 2013 the Irish government issued proceedings against Ryanair seeking recovery of EUR12 
million of alleged state aid attributable to Ryanair, arising from the European Commission decision. There is a risk 
that Ryanair will be ordered by the Irish courts to pay the EUR12 million amount to the Irish government 
notwithstanding Ryanair's claim for repayment of the entire amount of the tax.
 Matters Related to Investment in Aer Lingus. During the 2007 fiscal year, the Company acquired 25.2% of Aer 
Lingus. The Company increased its interest to 29.3% during the 2008 fiscal year, and to 29.8% during the 2009 
fiscal year at a total aggregate cost of EUR407.2 million. Following the acquisition of its initial stake and upon the 
approval of the Company's shareholders, management proposed to effect a tender offer to acquire the entire share 
capital of Aer Lingus. This 2006 offer was, however, prohibited by the European Commission on competition 
grounds. Ryanair filed an appeal with the CFI, which was heard in July 2009. On July 6, 2010 the Court upheld the 
European Commission's decision. (see also: "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Business 
Overview").
 The then EU Commissioner for Competition, Neelie Kroes, said on June 27, 2007 that, "Since Ryanair is not in a 
position to exert de jure or de facto control over Aer Lingus, the European Commission is not in a position to require 
Ryanair to divest its minority shareholding, which is, by the way, not a controlling stake." In October 2007, the 
European Commission also reached a formal decision that it would not force Ryanair to sell its shares in Aer 
Lingus. However, Aer Lingus appealed this decision before the CFI. In January 2008, the CFI heard an application 
by Aer Lingus for interim measures limiting Ryanair's voting rights, pending a decision of the CFI on Aer Lingus' 
appeal of the European Commission's decision not to force Ryanair to sell the Aer Lingus shares. In March 2008, 
the court dismissed Aer Lingus' application for interim measures. Aer Lingus' main appeal was heard in July 2009. 
On July 6, 2010, the court rejected Aer Lingus' appeal and confirmed that Ryanair cannot be forced to dispose of its 
29.8% stake in Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus chose not to appeal this judgment to the Court of Justice of the EU. EU 
legislation may change in the future to require such a forced disposal. If eventually forced to dispose of its stake in 
Aer Lingus, Ryanair could suffer significant losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of 
such a significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares.
 On December 1, 2008, Ryanair made a second offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it did not 
own at a price of EUR1.40 per ordinary share. Ryanair offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain 
the Aer Lingus brand, and retain its Heathrow slots and connectivity. Ryanair also proposed to double Aer Lingus' 
short-haul fleet from 33 to 66 aircraft and to create 1,000 associated new jobs over a five-year period. If the offer 
had been accepted, the Irish government would have received over EUR180 million in cash. The employee share 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -49-
ownership trust and employees who owned 18% of Aer Lingus would have received over EUR137 million in cash. 
The Company met Aer Lingus management, representatives of the employee share ownership trust and other 
parties. The offer of EUR1.40 per Aer Lingus share represented a premium of approximately 25% over the closing 
price of EUR1.12 on November 28, 2008. Ryanair also advised the market that it would not proceed to seek EU 
approval for the new bid unless the shareholders agreed to sell their stakes in Aer Lingus to Ryanair. However, as 
the Company was unable to secure the shareholders' support it decided, on January 28, 2009, to withdraw its 
second offer for Aer Lingus.
 The United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") wrote to Ryanair in September 2010, advising that it intended 
to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair objected on the basis that the OFT's investigation was 
time-barred. Ryanair contended that the OFT had and missed the opportunity to investigate Ryanair's minority 
stake within four months from the European Commission's June 2007 decision to prohibit Ryanair's takeover of Aer 
Lingus. The OFT agreed in October 2010 to suspend its investigation pending the outcome of Ryanair's appeal 
against the OFT's decision that its investigation is not time barred. On July 28, 2011, the Competition Appeal 
Tribunal ruled that the OFT was not time barred when it attempted in September 2010 to open an investigation into 
Ryanair's 2006 acquisition of a minority non-controlling stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair subsequently appealed the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal's decision.  On November 24, 2011, the UK Court of Appeal ordered a stay of the 
OFT's investigation

Body
 The Audit Committee currently comprises three independent, for purposes of the listing rules of the 
NASDAQ and the U.S. federal securities laws, non-executive directors, Mr Declan McKeon (Chairman), Mr 
Charles McCreevy and Mr Richard Milliken. The Board has determined that Mr Declan McKeon is the 
Committee's financial expert. It can be seen from the directors' biographies appearing on page 106, that 
the members of the committee bring to it a wide range of experience and expertise, much of which is 
particularly appropriate for membership of the Audit Committee.
 Number of Audit Committee meetings
 The Committee met five times during the year ended March 31, 2014. Individual attendance at these 
meetings is set out in the table on page 24. The Chief Financial Officer, Finance Director, Financial 
Controller and the Head of Internal Audit normally attend meetings of the Committee.  The external 
auditors attend as required and have direct access to the Committee Chairman at all times. The Committee 
also meets separately at least once a year with the external auditors and with the Head of Internal Audit 
without executive management being present. The Head of Internal Audit has direct access to the Audit 
Committee Chairman at all times.
 Summary of the role of the Audit Committee
 The role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set out in its written terms of reference, which 
are available on the Company's website www.ryanair.com, and include:
 --      monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and any formal announcements 
relating to the Group's financial performance, profit guidance and reviewing significant financial 
reporting judgments contained in them;
 --      considering significant issues in relation to the financial statements, having regard to matters 
communicated to it by the auditors;
 --      reviewing the interim and annual financial statements and annual report before submission to the 
Board,  including advising the Board whether, taken as a whole, the content of the annual report and Form 
20F is fair balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the company's performance, business model and strategy;
 --      reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's internal financial controls and risk management 
systems;
 --      reviewing Turnbull Risk Management reports completed by management;
 --      monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's Internal auditors;
 --      considering and making recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, reappointment 
and removal of the external auditors and approving their terms of engagement;
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -7-
 --      reviewing with the external auditors the plans for and scope of each annual audit, the audit 
procedures to be utilised and the results of the audit;
 --      approving the remuneration of the external auditors, for audit and non audit services and 
ensuring the level of fees is appropriate to enable an adequate audit to be conducted;
 --      assessing annually the independence and objectivity of the external auditors and the 
effectiveness of the audit process, taking into consideration relevant professional and regulatory 
requirements and the relationship with the external auditors as a whole, including the provision of any 
non audit services;
 --      reviewing the Group's arrangements for its employees to raise concerns, in confidence, about 
possible wrongdoing in financial reporting or other matters and ensuring that these arrangements allow 
proportionate and independent investigation of such matters and appropriate follow up action.
 --      The terms of Reference of the Audit Committee are reviewed annually.
 These responsibilities of the Committee are discharged in the following ways:
 --      The Committee reviews the interim and annual reports as well as any formal announcements relating 
to the financial statements and guidance before submission to the Board. The review focuses particularly 
on any changes in accounting policy and practices, major judgmental areas and compliance with stock 
exchange, legal and regulatory requirements. The Committee receives reports at the meeting from the 
external auditors identifying any accounting or judgmental issues requiring its attention;
 --      The Committee also meets with external auditors to review the Annual Report and Form 20F, which 
is filed annually with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and with the Irish Companies 
Office;
 --      The Committee regularly reviews Turnbull Risk management reports completed by management;
 --      The Committee conducts an annual assessment of the operation of the Group's system of internal 
control based on a detailed review carried out by the internal audit department. The results of this 
assessment are reviewed by the Committee and are reported to the Board;
 --      The Committee makes recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment of the external 
auditor. Each year, the Committee meets with the external auditor and reviews their procedures and the 
safeguards which have been put in place to ensure their objectivity and independence in accordance with 
regulatory and professional requirements;
 --      The Committee reviews and approves the external audit plan and the findings from the external 
audit of the financial statements;
 --      On a semi annual basis, the Audit Committee receives an extensive report from the Head of 
Internal Audit detailing the reviews performed during the year and a risk assessment of the Company;
 --      The Head of Internal Audit also reports to the Committee on other issues including, in the year 
under review, updates in relation to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 and the arrangements in 
place to enable employees to raise concerns, in confidence, in relation to possible wrongdoing in 
financial reporting or other matters. (A copy of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 can be 
obtained from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's website,            www.sec.gov); and
 --      The Committee has a process in place to ensure the independence of the audit is not compromised, 
which includes monitoring the nature and extent of services provided by the external auditors through its 
annual review of fees paid to the external auditors for audit and non-audit work. Details of the amounts 
paid to the external auditors during the year for audit and other services are set out in Note 19 on page 
189.
 In addition the Committee was requested by the board to consider whether the annual report, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the company's performance, business model and strategy. In doing so, the Committee considered 
whether the financial statements are consistent with the Chairman's Report, the Chief Executive's Report 
and operating and financial information elsewhere in the annual report.
 In considering the fairness, balance and understandability of the annual report, the Committee had regard 
to the significant issues considered by the Committee in relation to the financial statements, set out 
below. Each of these significant isssues was addressed in the report received from the external auditors 
and was discussed with management and the external auditors.
 The Committee reported to the board its conclusion that the annual report, taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company's performance, business model and strategy.
 Significant issues considered by the Committee in relation to the financial statements and how these 
issues were addressed, having regard to matters communicated to it by the auditors
 --      On page 91, one of the critical accounting policies referred to is that for long lived assets. 
There is a detailed description of the matters of estimate and the judgemental issues arising from the 
application of the Company's policy for accounting for such assets and how the Company dealt with these. 
The Audit Committee had detailed discussions with management around its conclusions in relation to the 
expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual lives of the assets and whether there are 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -7-
impairment indicators in respect of the assets. In particular, while the airline industry as a whole has 
from time to time experienced issues which would present as impairment indicators, this has not impacted 
on Ryanair, because of the positive cash flows these long lived assets generate. The Audit Committee 
agreed with managements approach and conclusions in relation to the accounting for long lived assets;
 --      On pages 91 and 92 the critical accounting policy for heavy maintenance is similarly described in 
detail, in particular the factors upon which Ryanair relied in making its estimates in determining the 
quantum of both the initial maintenance asset and / or the amount of provisions to be recorded and the 
respective periods over which such amounts are charged to income. Having considered the results of 
management's deliberations in this area and the reliability of estimates made in previous years, the Audit 
Committee concurred with management's approach and conclusions in relation to the accounting for heavy 
maintenance;
 --      On page 92, one of the Risks related to the Company that is identified is that "Ryanair is 
Subject to Tax Audits", which by their nature are often complex and can require several years to conclude. 
The Audit Committee considered the key judgements made in estimating the tax charge including provisioning 
relating to jurisdictions where the Group's tax affairs are under investigation by the relevant 
authorities. The Audit Committee reviewed the status of the tax audits, together with the advice of 
relevant members of the management team and external tax advisors, and agreed that the provisioning for 
any potential exposures is appropriate.

 Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the 
Company and the notes thereto included in Item 18. Those consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS.
 HISTORY
 Ryanair's current business strategy dates to the early 1990s, when a new management team, including the current 
chief executive, commenced the restructuring of Ryanair's operations to become a low-fares airline based on the 
low-cost operating model pioneered by Southwest Airlines Co. in the United States. During the period between 
1992 and 1994, Ryanair expanded its route network to include scheduled passenger services between Dublin and 
Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow (Prestwick). In 1994, Ryanair began standardizing its fleet by purchasing 
used Boeing 737-200A aircraft to replace substantially all of its leased aircraft. Beginning in 1996, Ryanair 
continued to expand its service from Dublin to new provincial destinations in the U.K. In August 1996, Irish Air, L.P., 
an investment vehicle led by David Bonderman and certain of his associates at the Texas Pacific Group, acquired a 
minority interest in the Company. Ryanair Holdings completed its initial public offering in June 1997.
 From 1997 through June 30, 2014, Ryanair launched service on more than 1,600 routes throughout Europe and 
also increased the frequency of service on a number of its principal routes. During that period, in addition to Dublin, 
Ryanair established 69 airports as bases of operations. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-Route System, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -35-
Scheduling and Fares" for a list of these bases. Ryanair has increased the number of booked passengers from 
approximately 4.9 million in the 1999 fiscal year to approximately 81.7 million in the 2014 fiscal year. Ryanair had a 
principal fleet of 297 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and 5 additional leased aircraft acquired on short term leases for the 
summer of 2014 to provide extra capacity, and now serves approximately 186 airports.
 Ryanair expects to have approximately 426 aircraft in its operating fleet by March 31, 2019. This is subject to lease 
handbacks and disposals over the period to March 31, 2019 meeting current expectations. See " 3/4 Liquidity and 
Capital Resources" and "Item 4. Information on the Company 3/4 Aircraft" for additional details.
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 Since Ryanair pioneered its low cost operating model in Europe in the early 1990s, its passenger volumes and 
scheduled passenger revenues have increased significantly because it has substantially increased capacity and 
demand has been sufficient to match the increased capacity. Ryanair's annual booked passenger volume has 
grown from approximately 945,000 passengers in the calendar year 1992 to approximately 81.7 million passengers 
in the 2014 fiscal year.
 Ryanair's revenue passenger miles ("RPMs") increased approximately 8% from 59,865.6 million in the 2013 fiscal 
year to 64,470.4 million in the 2014 fiscal year due primarily to an increase of approximately 7% in scheduled 
available seat miles ("ASMs") from 72,829.9 million in the 2013 fiscal year to 77,916.5 million in the 2014 fiscal 
year. Scheduled passenger revenues decreased approximately 1% from EUR3,819.8 million in the 2013 fiscal year 
to EUR3,789.5 million in the 2014 fiscal year. Average booked passenger fare decreased from EUR48.20 in the 
2013 fiscal year to EUR46.40 in the 2014 fiscal year.
 Expanding passenger volumes and capacity, high load factors and aggressive cost containment have enabled 
Ryanair to continue to generate operating profits despite increasing price competition and increases in certain 
costs. Ryanair's total break-even load factor was 70% in the 2013 fiscal year and 72% in the 2014 fiscal year. Cost 
per passenger was EUR52.56 in the 2013 fiscal year and EUR53.61 in the 2014 fiscal year, with the increase 
primarily reflecting the higher fuel cost per passenger of EUR24.65in the 2014 fiscal year, as compared to 
EUR23.79 in the 2013 fiscal year. Ryanair recorded operating profits of EUR718.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year 
and EUR658.6 million in the 2014 fiscal year. The Company recorded a profit after taxation of EUR569.3 million in 
the 2013 fiscal year and profit after taxation of EUR522.8 million in the 2014 fiscal year. Ryanair will take delivery of 
11 Boeing 737-800 aircraft in 2015 fiscal year and expects that these deliveries, along with its plan to ground fewer 
aircraft in the winter of 2015 fiscal year and increased load factors will allow for an approximately 4% increase in 
fiscal 2015 traffic See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company- Ryanair Has Decided 
to Seasonally Ground Aircraft."
 Investment in Aer Lingus
 The Company owns 29.8% of Aer Lingus, which it acquired in fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009 at a total cost of 
EUR407.2 million. Following the approval of its shareholders, management proposed in the 2007 fiscal year to 
effect a tender offer to acquire the entire share capital of Aer Lingus. This 2006 offer was, however, prohibited by 
the European Commission on competition grounds in June 2007. Ryanair's management viewed the acquisition of 
Aer Lingus in the context of the overall trend of consolidation among airlines in Europe and believed that the 
acquisition would lead to the formation of one strong Irish airline group able to compete with large carriers such as 
Lufthansa, Air France/KLM and British Airways/Iberia (now "International Airlines Group"). During the EU 
competition review, the Company made a commitment that if the acquisition was approved, Ryanair would eliminate 
Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges and reduce its fares, which would have resulted in Aer Lingus passengers saving 
approximately EUR100 million per year. The Company was therefore disappointed by the European Commission's 
decision to prohibit this offer. This decision was the first adverse decision taken in respect of any EU airline merger 
and the first-ever adverse decision in respect of a proposed merger of two companies with less than 5% of the EU 
market for their services. Ryanair filed an appeal with the CFI, which was heard in July 2009. On July 6, 2010, the 
CFI upheld the Commission's decision.
 In October 2007, the European Commission also reached a formal decision that it would not force Ryanair to sell 
its shares in Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus appealed this decision before the CFI. This case was heard in July 2009 and 
on July 6, 2010 the court rejected Aer Lingus' appeal and confirmed that Ryanair cannot be forced to dispose of its 
29.8% stake in Aer Lingus under the European Merger Regulation. However, EU legislation may change in the 
future to require such a forced disposition. If eventually forced to dispose of its stake in Aer Lingus, Ryanair could 
suffer significant losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion 
of Aer Lingus' shares.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -35-
 On December 1, 2008, Ryanair made a new offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it did not own 
at a price of EUR1.40 per ordinary share. Ryanair offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain the 
Aer Lingus brand, and retain its Heathrow slots and connectivity. Ryanair also proposed to double Aer Lingus' 
short-haul fleet from 33 to 66 aircraft and to create 1,000 associated new jobs over a five-year period. If the offer 
had been accepted, the Irish government would have received over EUR180 million in cash. The employee share 
ownership trust and employees, who owned 18% of Aer Lingus, would have received over EUR137 million in cash. 
The Company met Aer Lingus management, representatives of the employee share ownership trust and other 
parties, including members of the Irish Government. The offer of EUR1.40 per share represented a premium of 
approximately 25% over the closing price of EUR1.12 for Aer Lingus shares on November 28, 2008. As the 
Company was unable to secure the shareholders' support, it decided on January 28, 2009 to withdraw its offer for 
Aer Lingus.
 The United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") wrote to Ryanair in September 2010, advising that it intended 
to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair objected on the basis that the OFT's investigation was 
time-barred. Ryanair contended that the OFT had the opportunity, which it missed, to investigate Ryanair's minority 
stake within four months from the European Commission's June 2007 decision to prohibit Ryanair's takeover of Aer 
Lingus. The OFT agreed in October 2010 to suspend its investigation pending the outcome of Ryanair's appeal 
against the OFT's decision that its investigation is within time. On July 28, 2011, the Competition Appeal Tribunal 
ruled that the OFT was not time barred when it attempted in September 2010 to open an investigation into 
Ryanair's 2006 acquisition of a minority non-controlling stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair subsequently appealed the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal's decision.  On November 24, 2011, the UK Court of Appeal ordered a stay of the 
OFT's investigation pending the Courts review of whether the OFT's investigation was time barred.  On May 22, 
2012, the UK Court of Appeal found that the OFT was not time barred to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer 
Lingus in September 2010.  Ryanair subsequently sought permission to appeal that ruling to the UK Supreme 
Court,

 Louise Phelan (Director). Louise Phelan has served as a director since December 2012. Ms. Phelan is VP 
for PayPal Global Operations Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA), leading over 2,000 people in Dublin, 
Dundalk and Berlin. Ms. Phelan is the current President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland and 
a prominent member of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce Ireland, CCMA Ireland, the Women's Executive Network 
(WXN), and is an Irish citizen.
 The Board of Directors has established a number of committees, including the following:
 Executive Committee. The Board of Directors established the Executive Committee in August 1996. The 
Executive Committee can exercise the powers exercisable by the full Board of Directors in circumstances in 
which action by the Board of Directors is required but it is impracticable to convene a meeting of the 
full Board of Directors. Messrs. Bonderman, McLaughlin, O'Leary and Osborne are the members of the 
Executive Committee.
 Remuneration Committee. The Board of Directors established the Remuneration Committee in September 1996. 
This committee has authority to determine the remuneration of senior executives of the Company and to 
administer the stock option plans described below. The Board of Directors as a whole determines the 
remuneration and bonuses of the chief executive officer, who is the only executive director. Mr. Osborne, 
Ms. O'Neill and Ms. Phelan are the members of the Remuneration Committee.
 Audit Committee. The Board of Directors established the Audit Committee in September 1996 to make 
recommendations concerning the engagement of independent chartered accountants; to review with the 
accountants the plans for and scope of each annual audit, the audit procedures to be utilized and the 
results of the audit; to approve the professional services provided by the accountants; to review the 
independence of the accountants; and to review the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's internal 
accounting controls. Messrs. McKeon, McCreevy and Milliken are the members of the Audit Committee. In 
accordance with the recommendations of the Irish Combined Code of Corporate Governance (the "Combined 
Code"), a senior independent non-executive director, Mr. McKeon, is the chairman of the Audit Committee. 
All members of the Audit Committee are independent for purposes of the listing rules of the NASDAQ and the 
U.S. federal securities laws.
 Nomination Committee. The Board of Directors established the Nomination Committee in May 1999 to make 
recommendations and proposals to the full Board of Directors concerning the selection of individuals to 
serve as executive and non-executive directors. The Board of Directors as a whole then makes appropriate 
determinations regarding such matters after considering such recommendations and proposals. Messrs. 
Bonderman, McLaughlin and O'Leary are the members of the Nomination Committee.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -45-
 Air Safety Committee. The Board of Directors established the Air Safety Committee in March 1997 to review 
and discuss air safety and related issues. The Air Safety Committee reports to the full Board of Directors 
each quarter. The Air Safety Committee is composed of Mr. Horgan and Howard Millar, Chief Financial 
Officer and Accountable Manager for Safety (who both act as co-chairman), as well as the following 
executive officers of Ryanair: Messrs. Hickey, O'Brien and Wilson and the Chief Pilot, Ray Conway.
 Powers of, and Action by, the Board of Directors
 The Board of Directors is empowered by the Articles to carry on the business of Ryanair Holdings, subject 
to the Articles, provisions of general law and the right of stockholders to give directions to the 
directors by way of ordinary resolutions. Every director who is present at a meeting of the Board of 
Directors of Ryanair Holdings has one vote. In the case of a tie on a vote, the chairman of the Board of 
Directors has a second or tie-breaking vote. A director may designate an alternate director to attend any 
Board of Directors meeting, and such alternate director shall have all the rights of a director at such 
meeting.
 The quorum for a meeting of the Board of Directors, unless another number is fixed by the directors, 
consists of three directors, a majority of whom must be EU nationals. The Articles require the vote of a 
majority of the directors (or alternates) present at a duly convened meeting for the approval of any 
action by the Board of Directors.
 Composition and Term of Office
 The Articles provide that the Board of Directors shall consist of no fewer than three and no more than 15 
directors, unless otherwise determined by the stockholders. There is no maximum age for a director and no 
director is required to own any shares of Ryanair Holdings.
 Directors are elected (or have their appointments confirmed) at the annual general meetings of 
stockholders. Save in certain circumstances, at every annual general meeting, one-third (rounded down to 
the next whole number if it is a fractional number) of the directors (being the directors who have been 
longest in office) must stand for re-election as their terms expire. Accordingly the terms of David 
Bonderman, James Osborne and Michael O'Leary will have expired and they will be eligible to offer 
themselves for re-election at the next annual general meeting of Ryanair. In addition, Michael Cawley, who 
was Ryanair's Chief Operating Officer up to March 2014, will also offer himself for appointment to the 
Board of Directors at the next Annual General Meeting, which is scheduled to be held on September 25, 
2014.
 Exemptions from NASDAQ Corporate Governance Rules
 The Company relies on certain exemptions from the NASDAQ corporate governance rules. These exemptions, 
and the practices the Company adheres to, are as follows:
 --      The Company is exempt from NASDAQ's quorum requirements applicable to meetings of shareholders, 
which require a minimum quorum of 33% for any meeting of the holders of common stock, which in the 
Company's case are its Ordinary Shares. In keeping with Irish generally accepted business practice, the 
Articles provide for a quorum for general meetings of shareholders of three shareholders, regardless of 
the level of their aggregate share ownership.
 --      The Company is exempt from NASDAQ's requirement with respect to audit committee approval of 
related-party transactions, as well as its requirement that shareholders approve certain stock or asset 
purchases when a director, officer or substantial shareholder has an interest. The Company is subject to 
extensive provisions under the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange (the "Irish Listing Rules") 
governing transactions with related parties, as defined therein, and the Irish Companies Act also 
restricts the extent to which Irish companies may enter into related-party transactions. In addition, the 
Articles contain provisions regarding disclosure of interests by the directors and restrictions on their 
votes in circumstances involving conflicts of interest. The concept of a related party for purposes of 
NASDAQ's audit committee and shareholder approval rules differs in certain respects from the definition of 
a transaction with a related party under the Irish Listing Rules.
 --      NASDAQ requires shareholder approval for certain transactions involving the sale or issuance by a 
listed company of common stock other than in a public offering. Under the NASDAQ rules, whether 
shareholder approval is required for such transactions depends, among other things, on the number of 
shares to be issued or sold in connection with a transaction, while the Irish Listing Rules require 
shareholder approval when the size of a transaction exceeds a certain percentage of the size of the listed 
company undertaking the transaction.
 --      NASDAQ requires that each issuer solicit proxies and provide proxy statements for all meetings of 
shareholders and provide copies of such proxy solicitation to NASDAQ. The Company is exempt from this 
requirement as the solicitation of holders of ADSs is not required under the Irish Listing Rules or the 
Irish Companies Acts. Details of our annual general meetings and other shareholder meetings, together with 
the requirements for admission, voting or the appointment of a proxy are available on the website of the 
Company in accordance with the Irish Companies Acts and the Company's Articles of Association. ADS holders 
may provide instructions to The Bank of New York, as depositary, as to the voting of the underlying 
Ordinary Shares represented by such ADSs. Alternatively, ADS holders may convert their holding to Ordinary 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -45-
Shares, subject to compliance with the nationality ownership rules, in order to be eligible to attend our 
annual general meetings or other shareholder meetings.
 --      NASDAQ requires that all members of a listed company's Nominating Committee be independent 
directors, unless the Company, as a foreign private issuer, provides an attestation of non-conforming 
practice based upon home country practice and then discloses such non-conforming practice annually in its 
Form 20-F.  As permitted by the UK Corporate Governance Code, Michael O'Leary, the Company's Chief 
Executive Officer, serves as a member of the Company's Nominating Committee.
 The Company also follows certain other practices under the UK Corporate Governance Code in lieu of those 
set forth in the NASDAQ corporate governance rules, as expressly permitted thereby. Most significantly:

 --           Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of 
the contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2014 
has been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 Financial instruments not measured at fair value
 --    Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted 
at the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at the relevant reporting 
year end date to arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the 
obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the year to March 31, 
2014 that affect the fair value of the Company's Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
 The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet categorised by 
the type of valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --      Level 1: Inputs are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical 
instruments.
 --      Level 2: Inputs are based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that 
are not active, quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and model-based valuation 
techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by 
observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
 --      Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability are not based on observable market data.

 THE COMPANY
 Ryanair operates an ultra-low cost, scheduled airline serving short-haul, point-to-point routes largely 
in Europe from its 69 bases in airports across Europe, which together are referred to as "Ryanair's bases 
of operations" or "Ryanair's bases."  For a list of these bases, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Route System, Scheduling and Fares."  Ryanair pioneered the low-fares operating model in Europe in the 
early 1990s. As of June 30, 2014, the Company offered over 1,600 scheduled short-haul flights per day 
serving approximately 186 airports largely throughout Europe, with a principal fleet of 297 Boeing 737-800 
aircraft and 5 additional leased aircraft acquired on short term leases for the summer of 2014 to provide 
extra capacity flying approximately 1,600 routes. The Company also holds a 29.8% interest in Aer Lingus 
Group plc ("Aer Lingus"), which it has acquired through market purchases following Aer Lingus' partial

financial reporting and internal control issues. The Audit Committee, which consists exclusively of 
independent non-executive directors, meets at least quarterly to review the financial statements of the 
Company, to consider internal control procedures and to liaise with internal and external auditors. In the 
year ended March 31, 2014 the Audit Committee met on five occasions. On a quarterly basis the Audit 
Committee receives an extensive report from the internal auditor detailing the reviews performed in the 
year, and a risk assessment of the Company. This report is used by the Audit Committee and the Board of 
Directors, as a basis for determining the effectiveness of internal control.  The Audit Committee 
regularly considers the performance of internal audit and how best financial reporting and internal 
control principles should be applied.
 In addition, the Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing 
the work of the independent auditor. The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit 
services provided by the independent auditor.

At March 31, 2014, aircraft with a net book value of EUR4,471.1 million (2013: EUR4,663.0 million; 2012: 
EUR4,856.0 million) were mortgaged to lenders as security for loans. Under the security arrangements for 
the Company's new Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, the Company does not hold legal title to 
those aircraft while these loan amounts remain outstanding.
 At March 31, 2014, the cost and net book value of aircraft included advance payments on aircraft of 
EUR282.1 million (2013: Nil; 2012: EUR110.5 million).  Such amounts, where present, are not depreciated. 
The cost and net book value also includes capitalised aircraft maintenance, aircraft simulators and the 
stock of rotable spare parts.

Landing
 rights......................................................................................      46.8   
46.8   46.8
 =====  =====  =====
Landing slots were acquired with the acquisition of Buzz Stansted Limited in April 2003. As these landing 
slots have no expiry date and are expected to be used in perpetuity, they are considered to be of 
indefinite life and accordingly are not amortised. The Company also considers that there has been no 
impairment of the value of these rights to date. The recoverable amount of these rights has been 
determined on a value-in-use basis, using discounted cash-flow projections for a twenty-year period for 
each route that has an individual landing right. The calculation of value-in-use is most sensitive to the 
operating margin and discount rate assumptions. Operating margins are based on the existing margins 
generated from these routes and adjusted for any known trading conditions. The trading environment is 
subject to both regulatory and competitive pressures that can have a material effect on the operating 
performance of the business. Foreseeable events, however, are unlikely to result in a change of 
projections of a significant nature so as to result in the landing rights' carrying amounts exceeding 
their recoverable amounts. These projections have been discounted based on the estimated discount rate 
applicable to the asset of 5.3% for 2014, 7.0% for 2013, and 7.7% for 2012.

 ======  ======  ======
As at March 31, 2014 Ryanair's total percentage shareholding in Aer Lingus was 29.8% (2013: 29.8%; 2012: 
29.8%). The balance sheet value of EUR260.3 million (2013: EUR221.2 million; 2012: EUR149.7 million) reflects 
the market value of this investment as at March 31, 2014. In accordance with the Company's accounting policy, this 
asset is held at fair value with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income following initial 
acquisition. Any impairment losses that arise are recognised in the income statement and are not subsequently 
reversed.  Any cumulative loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income 
statement once an impairment is considered to have occurred.

 The weighted-average interest rate on the cumulative borrowings under these facilities of EUR3,083.6 million at 
March 31, 2014 was 2.49%. Ryanair's ability to obtain additional loans pursuant to each of the facilities to finance 
the price of future Boeing 737-800 aircraft purchases is subject to the issuance of further bank commitments and 
the satisfaction of various contractual conditions. In addition, as a result of the Company obtaining a BBB+ credit 
rating from Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings and following Ryanair's recent issuance in June 2014 of an 
unsecured eurobond in the amount of EUR850.0 million with a coupon of 1.875% with a tenor of 7 years that are 
guaranteed by Ryanair Holdings, the Company may decide in the future to issue additional debt from through the 
capital markets to finance future aircraft deliveries. These conditions include, among other things, the execution of 
satisfactory documentation, the requirement that Ryanair perform all of its obligations under the Boeing agreements 
and provide satisfactory security interests in the aircraft (and related assets) in favor of the lenders and Ex-Im Bank, 
and that Ryanair not suffer a material adverse change in its conditions or prospects (financial or otherwise).
 As part of its Ex-Im Bank guarantee-based financing of the Boeing 737-800s, Ryanair has entered into certain 
lease agreements and related arrangements. Pursuant to these arrangements, legal title to the 210 aircraft 
delivered and remaining in the fleet as of March 31, 2014 rests with a number of United States special purpose 
vehicles (the "SPVs"). The SPVs are the borrowers of record under the loans made or to be made under the 
facilities, with all of their obligations under the loans being guaranteed by Ryanair Holdings.
 These Aircraft are financed using a standard Ex-Im Bank "orphan" ownership structure. The shares of the SPVs 
(which are owned by an unrelated charitable association and not by Ryanair) are in turn pledged to a security 
trustee in favor of Ex-Im Bank and the lenders. Ryanair operates each of the aircraft pursuant to a finance lease it 
has entered into with the SPVs, the terms of which mirror those of the relevant loans under the facilities. Ryanair 
has the right to purchase the aircraft upon termination of the lease for a nominal amount. Pursuant to this 
arrangement, Ryanair is considered to own the aircraft for accounting purposes under IFRS. Ryanair does not use 
special purpose entities for off-balance sheet financing or any other purpose which results in assets or liabilities not 
being reflected in Ryanair's consolidated financial statements. In addition to its purchase option under the finance 
lease, Ryanair is entitled to receive the balance of any proceeds received in respect of the aircraft that remain after 
Ex-Im Bank and the lenders are paid what they are owed under the loan guarantees.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -43-
 Ryanair has a track record in securing finance for similar sized aircraft purchases. The 1998, 2002, 2003 and 2005 
Boeing Contracts totaling 348 aircraft were financed with approximately 66% US Ex-Im Bank loan guarantees and 
capital markets (with 85% loan to value) financing, 24% through sale and operating leaseback financing, and 10% 
through Japanese operating leases with call options ("JOLCOs"). See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and 
Prospects-Liquidity and Capital Resources."
 Under the new Aviation Sector Understanding which came into effect from January 1, 2013, the fees payable to 
Ex-Im Bank for the provision of loan guarantees have significantly increased, thereby making it more expensive 
than more traditional forms of financing. As a result, Ryanair intends to finance the New Aircraft obtained under the 
2013 Boeing Contract through a combination of internally generated cash flows, debt financing from commercial 
banks, debt financing through the capital markets in a secured and unsecured manner, commercial debt through 
JOLCOs and sale and operating leasebacks. These forms of financing are generally accepted in the aviation 
industry and are currently widely available for companies who have the credit quality of Ryanair. Ryanair may 
periodically use Ex-Im Bank loan guarantees when appropriate. Ryanair intends to finance pre-delivery payments 
("Aircraft Deposits") to Boeing in respect of the New Aircraft via internally generated cash flows similar to all 
previous Aircraft Deposit payments.
 At March 31, 2014, Ryanair had 51 operating lease aircraft in the fleet. As a result, Ryanair operates, but does not 
own, these aircraft, which were leased to provide flexibility for the aircraft delivery program. Ryanair has no right or 
obligation to acquire these aircraft at the end of the relevant lease terms. 18 leases are denominated in euro and 
require Ryanair to make fixed rental payments over the term of the lease. The remaining 33 operating leases are 
U.S. dollar-denominated and require Ryanair to make fixed rental payments. The Company has an option to extend 
the initial period of seven years on 34 of the 51 remaining operating lease aircraft as at March 31, 2014 on pre-
determined terms. This includes 3 operating lease arrangements which are due to mature during the year ended 
March 31, 2015 but have been extended for a further 7 years. In addition to the above, the Company financed 30 of 
the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between March 2005 and March 2014 with 13-year euro-denominated 
JOLCOs. These structures are accounted for as finance leases and are initially recorded at fair value in the 
Company's balance sheet. Under each of these contracts, Ryanair has a call option to purchase the aircraft at a 
pre-determined price after a period of 10.5 years, which it may exercise. Six aircraft have been financed through 
euro-denominated 12-year amortizing commercial debt transactions.
 Since, under each of the Company's operating leases, the Company has a commitment to maintain the relevant 
aircraft, an accounting provision is made during the lease term for this obligation based on estimated future costs of 
major airframe, engine maintenance checks and restitution of major life limited parts by making appropriate charges 
to the income statement calculated by reference to the number of hours or cycles operated during the year. Under 
IFRS, the accounting treatment for these costs with respect to leased aircraft differs from that for aircraft owned by 
the Company, for which such costs are capitalized and amortized.
 Ryanair recently obtained a BBB+ (stable) corporate rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings and 
established a EUR3 billion EMTN program. In June 2014, Ryanair issued EUR850.0 million in unsecured 
eurobonds with a 7 year tenor at a coupon of 1.875% under this program that are guaranteed by Ryanair Holdings. 
The Company intends to use the proceeds from this issuance for general corporate purposes, including the 
financing of aircraft.
 Contractual Obligations. The table below sets forth the contractual obligations and commercial commitments of the 
Company with definitive payment terms, which will require significant cash outlays in the future, as of March 31, 
2014. These obligations primarily relate to Ryanair's aircraft purchase and related financing obligations, which are 
described in more detail above, and do not reflect the EUR850.0 million in eurobonds issued in June 2014. For 
additional information on the Company's contractual obligations and commercial commitments, see Note 23 to the 
consolidated financial statements included in Item 18.
 The amounts listed under "Finance Lease Obligations" reflect the Company's obligations under its JOLCOs. See 
"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 3/4 Liquidity and Capital Resources."
 The amounts listed under "Purchase Obligations" in the table reflect obligations for aircraft purchases and are 
calculated by multiplying the number of aircraft the Company is obligated to purchase under its current agreements 
with Boeing during the relevant period by the Basic Price for each aircraft pursuant to the relevant contract, with the 
dollar-denominated Basic Price being converted into euro at an exchange rate of $1.3788 =EUR1.00 (based on the 
European Central Bank Rate on March 31, 2014). The relevant amounts therefore exclude the effect of the price 
concessions granted to Ryanair by Boeing and CFM, as well as any application of the Escalation Factor described 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -43-
below. As a result, Ryanair's actual expenditures for aircraft during the relevant periods will be lower than the 
amounts listed under "Purchase Obligations" in the table.
 With respect to purchase obligations under the terms of the 2013 Boeing Contract, the Company was required to 
pay Boeing 1% of the Basic Price of each of the 175 firm-order Boeing 737-800 aircraft at the time the contract was 
signed in April 2013 (such deposit being fully refundable if the Company had not received the shareholder approval 
it received at an extraordinary general meeting on June 18, 2013), and will be required to make periodic advance 
payments of the purchase price for each aircraft it has agreed to purchase during the course of the two-year period 
preceding the delivery of each aircraft. As a result of these required advance payments, the Company will have paid 
up to 30% of the Basic Price of each aircraft prior to its delivery (including the addition of an estimated "Escalation 
Factor" but before deduction of any credit memoranda and other concessions); the balance of the net price is due 
at the time of delivery. Similar terms applied under the 2005 Boeing contract, with the first payment due when the 
contract was signed in February 2005.
 The amounts listed under "Operating Lease Obligations" reflect the Company's obligations under its aircraft 
operating lease arrangements.

 ============  ===========  ===========  ===========
The Company has not disclosed the fair value for financial liabilities such as trade payables and accrued 
expenses because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of their fair values due to the 
short term nature of the instruments.
 Estimation of fair values
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Company's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --           Available-for- sale: The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is their quoted 
market bid price at the balance sheet date. (Level 1)
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -76-
 --           Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine 
the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)

 The Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates for certain 
floating rate financing of certain aircraft. Cash deposits are required to be set aside as collateral for certain historic 
interest rate swaps to mitigate the counterparty's exposure to fluctuations in the underlying interest rate swaps.  The 
following table sets out the carrying amounts of recognised financial instruments that are subject to the above 
agreements:

 but permission was refused. On June 15, 2012, the OFT referred the investigation of Ryanair's minority stake in 
Aer Lingus to the UK Competition Commission. On August 28, 2013, the UKCC issued its final decision in which it 
stated that Ryanair's shareholding "gave it the ability to exercise material influence over Aer Lingus" and "had led or 
may be expected to lead to a substantial lessening of competition in the markets for air passenger services 
between Great Britain and Ireland."  As a result of its findings, the UKCC ordered Ryanair to reduce its 
shareholding in Aer Lingus to below 5 percent of Aer Lingus' issued ordinary shares.  Ryanair appealed the UKCC's 
final decision to the CAT on September 23, 2013.  The CAT rejected Ryanair's appeal on March 7, 2014.  On April 
23, 2014, the CAT granted Ryanair permission to appeal the CAT's judgment to the UK Court of Appeal. 
 Should this appeal, or any subsequent appeal to the UK Supreme Court be unsuccessful, Ryanair could suffer 
losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer Lingus' 
shares.  Ryanair believes that the enforcement of any such decision should be delayed until the outcome of 
Ryanair's appeal against the European Commission's February 2013 prohibition decision of Ryanair's 2012 offer for 
Aer Lingus, as described below, and the conclusion of any appeals against the UKCC's decision in the UK courts.  
However, it is possible that the UKCC will seek to enforce any such sell-down remedy at an earlier date.
 On June 19, 2012, Ryanair made a third offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it did not own at a 
price of EUR1.30 per ordinary share.  The timing of the offer was influenced by: (i) the continued consolidation of 
European airlines, and more recently the International Airlines Group (the parent company of British Airways) 
takeover of British Midland International, where the No. 1 airline at Heathrow was allowed to acquire the No. 2; (ii) 
the additional capacity available at Dublin airport following the opening of Terminal 2 and the decline in traffic from 
23.3 million passengers per annum in 2007 to 18.7 million in 2011, has resulted in Dublin airport operating at 
approximately 50% capacity; (iii) the change in the Irish government policy since 2006 in that the Irish government 
indicated that it had decided to sell its stake in Aer Lingus; (iv) the fact that under the terms of the bailout agreement 
provided by the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund to Ireland, the 
Irish government committed to sell its stake in Aer Lingus; (v) the fact that the ESOT (Employee Share Ownership 
Trust), which at the time of the unsuccessful 2006 offer controlled 15% of Aer Lingus, had been disbanded since 
December 2010 and the shares distributed to the individual members, with the result that Ryanair's new offer was, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -36-
in Ryanair's view, capable of reaching over 50% acceptance either with or without government acceptance; and (vi) 
the fact that Etihad, an Abu Dhabi based airline, had recently acquired a 3% stake in Aer Lingus and had expressed 
an interest in buying the government's 25% stake in Aer Lingus (the offer therefore provided Etihad or any other 
potential bidder the opportunity to purchase the government's stake).
 Ryanair offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain the Aer Lingus brand, and to grow its traffic 
from 9.5 million to over 14.5 million passengers over a five year period post acquisition, by growing Aer Lingus' 
short haul traffic at some of Europe's major airports where Aer Lingus currently operates and Ryanair does not. 
Ryanair also intended to increase Aer Lingus' transatlantic traffic from Ireland, which has fallen in recent years, by 
investing in operations. If the offer was accepted, the Irish government would have received EUR173 million in 
cash. The offer of EUR1.30 per share represented a premium of approximately 38% over the closing price of 
EUR0.94 for Aer Lingus shares as of June 19, 2012. The offer was conditional on competition approval by the 
European Commission. However, on February 27, 2013, the European Commission prohibited the acquisition by 
Ryanair of the remaining share capital of Aer Lingus. Ryanair appealed this prohibition to the EU General Court on 
May 8, 2013. A judgment in this appeal is expected in 2015.
 The available-for-sale financial asset balance sheet value of EUR260.3 million reflects the market value of the 
Company's stake in Aer Lingus as of March 31, 2014, as compared to a value of EUR221.2 million as of March 31, 
2013. In accordance with the company's accounting policy, this investment is held at fair value. This investment is 
classified as available-for-sale, rather than as an investment in an associate, because the Company does not have 
the power to exercise any influence over Aer Lingus. The increase in the amount of the available for sale financial 
asset from EUR221.2 million at March 31, 2013 to EUR260.3 million at March 31, 2014 is comprised of a gain of 
EUR39.1 million, recognized through other comprehensive income, reflecting the increase in Aer Lingus' share 
price from EUR1.39 per share at March 31, 2013 to EUR1.64 per share at March 31, 2014. All impairment losses 
are required to be recognized in the income statement for investments in an equity instrument classified for 
available for sale and are not subsequently reversed, while gains are recognized through other comprehensive 
income.  The investment had in prior periods been impaired to EUR0.50 per share.
 The Company's determination that it does not have control, or even exercise a "significant influence," over Aer 
Lingus through its minority shareholding has been based on the following factors:
 (i) Ryanair does not have any representation on the Aer Lingus Board of Directors; nor does it have a right to 
appoint a director;
 (ii) Ryanair does not participate in Aer Lingus policy-making decisions; nor does it have a right to participate in 
such policy-making decisions;
 (iii) There are no material transactions between Ryanair and Aer Lingus, there is no interchange of personnel 
between the two companies and there is no sharing of technical information between the companies;
 (iv) Aer Lingus and its significant shareholder (the Irish government: 25.1%) have historically openly opposed 
Ryanair's investment or participation in the company;
 (v) In 2007, 2009 and 2010, Aer Lingus refused Ryanair's attempt to assert its statutory right to requisition a 
general meeting (a legal right of any 5% shareholder under Irish law);
 (vi) On April 15, 2011, the High Court in Dublin ruled that Aer Lingus was not obliged to accede to Ryanair's 
request that two additional resolutions (on the payment of a dividend and on payments to pension schemes) be put 
to vote at Aer Lingus' annual general meeting; and
 (vii) The European Commission has formally found that Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus does not grant 
Ryanair "de jure or de facto control of Aer Lingus" and that "Ryanair's rights as a minority shareholder...are 
associated exclusively to rights related to the protection of minority shareholders" (Commission Decision Case No. 
COMP/M.4439 dated October 11, 2007). The European Commission's finding has been confirmed by the European 
Union's General Court which issued a decision on July 6, 2010 that the European Commission was justified to use 
the required legal and factual standard in its refusal to order Ryanair to divest its minority shareholding in Aer 
Lingus and that, as part of that decision, Ryanair's shareholding did not confer control of Aer Lingus (Judgment of 
the General Court (Third Chamber) Case No. T-411/07 dated July 6, 2010).
 Historical Results Are Not Predictive of Future Results
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -36-
 The historical results of operations discussed herein may not be indicative of Ryanair's future operating 
performance. Ryanair's future results of operations will be affected by, among other things, overall passenger traffic 
volume; the availability of new airports for expansion; fuel prices; the airline pricing environment in a period of 
increased competition; the ability of Ryanair to finance its planned acquisition of aircraft and to discharge the 
resulting debt service obligations; economic and political conditions in Ireland, the U.K. and the EU; terrorist threats 
or attacks within the EU; seasonal variations in travel; developments in government regulations, litigation and labor 
relations; foreign currency fluctuations, the impact of the banking crisis and potential break-up of the euro; 
competition and the public's perception regarding the safety of low-fares airlines; the value of its equity stake in Aer 
Lingus; changes in aircraft acquisition, leasing, and other operating costs; flight interruptions caused by volcanic 
ash emissions or other atmospheric disruptions; flight disruptions caused by periodic and prolonged air traffic 
controller strikes in Europe; the rates of income and corporate taxes paid, and the impact of the financial and 
Eurozone crisis. Ryanair expects its depreciation, staff and fuel charges to increase as additional aircraft and 
related flight equipment are acquired. Future fuel costs may also increase as a result of the depletion of petroleum 
reserves, the shortage of fuel production capacity and/or production restrictions imposed by fuel oil producers. 
Maintenance expenses may also increase as a result of Ryanair's fleet expansion and replacement program. In 
addition, the financing of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft will increase the total amount of the Company's outstanding 
debt and the payments it is obliged to make to service such debt. The cost of insurance coverage for certain third-
party liabilities arising from "acts of war" or terrorism increased dramatically following the September 11, 2001 
terrorist attacks. Although Ryanair currently passes on increased insurance costs to passengers by means of a 
special "insurance levy" on each ticket, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be successful in doing so.

11           Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Company utilises financial instruments to reduce exposures to market risks throughout its business. 
Borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments are used to finance the Company's operations. 
Derivative financial instruments are contractual agreements with a value that reflects price movements in 
an underlying asset. The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally jet fuel derivatives, 
interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage 
commodity risks, interest rate risks and currency exposures and to achieve the desired profile of fixed 
and variable rate borrowings and leases in appropriate currencies. It is the Company's policy that no 
speculative trading in financial instruments shall take place.
 The main risks attaching to the Company's financial instruments, the Company's strategy and approach to 
managing these risks, and the details of the derivatives employed to hedge against these risks have been 
disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

Body
 In April 2012, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting to authorize the Directors to repurchase 
Ordinary Shares and ADRs for up to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company traded on the NASDAQ. Up 
until April 2012, shareholders had only authorized the Directors to repurchase Ordinary Shares. As the ADRs 
typically trade at a premium of up to 20% compared to Ordinary Shares, this may result in increased costs in 
performing share buy-backs in the future.  This authority was renewed at the Annual General Meeting held on 
September 20, 2013.  The Company completed EUR481.7 million in share buybacks in fiscal year 2014 and 
indicated on May 19, 2014 that it plans to pay a special dividend of up to EUR520 million in Quarter 4, fiscal year 
2015, subject to shareholder approval at its annual general meeting on September 25, 2014. The Company has 
made no further commitments in relation to the payment of dividends, share buybacks or other shareholder 
distributions.
 See "Item 9. The Offer and Listing - Trading Markets and Share Prices" below for further information regarding 
share buy-backs.
 SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
 On April 30, 2014, the Company agreed to purchase an additional 5 Boeing 737-800NG aircraft for delivery in fiscal 
2016, bringing the total number of aircraft to be purchased from Boeing to 180 for delivery between fiscal years 
2015 and 2019.
 In addition, in June 2014 Ryanair issued EUR850.0 million in unsecured eurobonds with a 7 year tenor at a coupon 
of 1.875%, which are guaranteed by Ryanair Holdings. See "Item 5. Operation and Financial Review and Prospects 
-- Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Capital Resources" for additional information.
 Item 9. The Offer and Listing
 TRADING MARKETS AND SHARE PRICES

Exchange"); Ordinary Shares are also traded on the London Stock Exchange. The Ordinary Shares were first listed 
for trading on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange on June 5, 1997 and were first admitted to the Official List 
of the London Stock Exchange on July 16, 1998.

periods indicated, the reported high and low closing sales prices of the ADRs on NASDAQ and for the Ordinary 
Shares on the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, and have been adjusted to reflect the two-

 All of the Company's operating profit arises from low-fares airline-related activities, its only business 
segment. The major revenue earning assets of the Company are its aircraft, which are registered in Ireland 
and therefore profits accrue principally in Ireland. Since the Company's aircraft fleet is flexibly 
employed across its route network in Europe, there is no suitable basis of allocating such assets and 
related liabilities to geographical segments.

Body
 The Company engages in equity-settled, share-based payment transactions in respect of services received 
from certain of its employees. The fair value of the services received is measured by reference to the 
fair value of the share options on the date of the grant. The grant measurement date is the date that a 
shared understanding of the terms of the award is established between the Company and the employee. The 
cost of the employee services received in respect of the share options granted is recognised in the income 
statement over the period that the services are received, which is the vesting period, with a 
corresponding increase in equity. To the extent that service is provided prior to the grant measurement 
date, the fair value of the share options is initially estimated and re-measured at each balance sheet 
date until the grant measurement date is achieved. The fair value of the options granted is determined 
using a binomial lattice option-pricing model, which takes into account the exercise price of the option, 
the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the Ryanair Holdings plc 
share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors. Non-market vesting conditions are 
taken into account by adjusting the number of shares or share options included in the measurement of the 
cost of employee services so that ultimately, the amount recognised in the income statement reflects the 
number of vested shares or share options.
 Pensions and other post-retirement obligations
 The Company provides certain employees with post-retirement benefits in the form of pensions. The Company 
currently operates a number of defined contribution schemes and a small defined benefit pension scheme in 
the U.K.
 Costs arising in respect of the Company's defined contribution pension schemes (where fixed contributions 
are paid into the scheme and there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts) are 
charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Any contributions unpaid at the 
balance sheet date are included as a liability.
 A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined-contribution plan. The 
liabilities and costs associated with the Company's defined benefit pension scheme are assessed on the 
basis of the projected unit credit method by professionally qualified actuaries and are arrived at using 
actuarial assumptions based on market expectations at the balance sheet date. The net obligation in 
respect of defined benefit schemes is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of 
future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.  
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of any plan asset is 
deducted. The discount rates employed in determining the present value of each scheme's liabilities are 
determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date of high quality corporate bonds in the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -69-
same currency and term that is consistent with those of the associated pension obligations. The net 
surplus or deficit arising on the Company's defined-benefit scheme is shown within non-current assets or 
liabilities on the balance sheet. The deferred tax impact of any such amount is disclosed separately 
within deferred tax.
 Re-measurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding net 
interest), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to 
retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
 Taxation
 Income tax on the profit or loss for a year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised 
in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive 
income (such as certain hedging derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale assets, pensions and 
other post-retirement obligations). Current tax payable on taxable profits is recognised as an expense in 
the period in which the profits arise using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
 Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary 
differences arising from the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and legislation 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and expected to apply when the temporary 
differences reverse.
 The following temporary differences are not provided for: (i) the initial recognition of assets and 
liabilities that effect neither accounting nor taxable profit and (ii) differences relating to investments 
in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable they will not reverse in the future.
 A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets 
are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that a 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be realised.
 Social insurance, passenger taxes and sales taxes are recorded as a liability based on laws enacted in 
the jurisdictions to which they relate.  Liabilities are recorded when an obligation has been incurred.
 Tax liabilities are based on the best estimate of the likely obligation at each reporting period.  These 
estimates are subject to revision based on the outcome of tax audits and discussions with revenue 
authorities that can take several years to conclude.
 Share capital
 Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of 
ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. When 
share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, which includes any 
directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased 
shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity, until they 
are cancelled.
 Prospective accounting changes, new standards and interpretations not yet adopted
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted from their 
effective dates for the purposes of the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable.  We 
do not anticipate that the adoption of these new or revised standards and interpretations will have a

 MATERIAL CONTRACTS
 On March 19, 2013, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase 175 
Boeing 737-800NG aircraft, with a list value of over $13.8 billion, over a five year period from fiscal 2015 to 2019 in 
accordance with the terms of the contract. The contract was approved by the shareholders of the Company at an 
extraordinary general meeting on June 18, 2013. On April 30, 2014, the Company agreed to purchase an additional 
5 Boeing 737-800NG aircraft for delivery in fiscal 2016, bringing the total number of aircraft to be purchased from 
Boeing to 180 for delivery between fiscal years 2015 and 2019, with a list value of approximately $14.1 billion.
 EXCHANGE CONTROLS
 Except as indicated below, there are no restrictions on non-residents of Ireland dealing in Irish securities (including 
shares or depositary receipts of Irish companies such as the Company). Dividends and redemption proceeds also 
continue to be freely transferable to non-resident holders of such securities.
 Under the Financial Transfers Act 1992 (the "1992 Act"), the Minister for Finance of Ireland may make provision for 
the restriction of financial transfers between Ireland and other countries. Financial transfers are broadly defined, 
and the acquisition or disposal of the ADRs, which represent shares issued by an Irish incorporated company, the 
acquisition or the disposal of Ordinary Shares and associated payments may fall within this definition. Dividends or 
payments on the redemption or purchase of shares and payments on the liquidation of an Irish-incorporated 
company would fall within this definition.
 The 1992 Act prohibits financial transfers involving the late Slobodan Milosevic and certain associated persons, 
President Lukashenko, the Belarusian leadership and certain other officials of Belarus, Burma (Myanmar), certain 
persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, certain persons and entities 
associated with the now deceased Usama Bin Laden, the Al-Qaeda network and the Taliban of Afghanistan, the 
Democratic Republic of Congo, certain persons in Egypt, certain activities, persons and entities in Eritrea, the 
Republic of Guinea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), Iraq, Côte d'Ivoire, certain activities 
in Lebanon, certain activities in Liberia and the former Liberian President Charles Taylor, his immediate family and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -55-
close associates, Libya, certain persons in Tunisia, certain activities and persons in Zimbabwe, certain persons and 
activities in Sudan and South Sudan, Somalia, certain activities, persons and entities in Syria and Iran, certain 
persons, entities and bodies in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, certain known terrorists and terrorist groups, and 
countries that harbor certain terrorist groups, without the prior permission of the Central Bank of Ireland.
 Any transfer of, or payment in respect of, an ADS involving the government of any country that is currently the 
subject of United Nations sanctions, any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing, or any person acting on 
behalf of the foregoing, may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into Irish law. The 
Company does not anticipate that Irish exchange controls or orders under the 1992 Act or United Nations sanctions 
implemented into Irish law will have a material effect on its business.
 LIMITATIONS ON SHARE OWNERSHIP BY NON-EU NATIONALS
 The Board of Directors of Ryanair Holdings is given certain powers under the Articles to take action to ensure that 
the number of Ordinary Shares held in Ryanair Holdings by non-EU nationals does not reach a level which could 
jeopardize the Company's entitlement to continue to hold or enjoy the benefit of any license, permit, consent or 
privilege which it holds or enjoys and which enables it to carry on business as an air carrier (a "License"). In 
particular, EU Regulation 2407/92 requires that, in order to obtain and retain an operating license, an EU air carrier 
must be majority-owned and effectively controlled by EU nationals. The regulation does not specify what level of 
share ownership will confer effective control on a holder or holders of shares. As described below, the directors will, 
from time to time, set a "Permitted Maximum" on the number of Ordinary Shares that may be owned by non-EU 
nationals at such level as they believe will comply with EU law. The Permitted Maximum is currently set at 49.9%.
 Ryanair Holdings maintains a separate register (the "Separate Register") of Ordinary Shares in which non-EU 
nationals, whether individuals, bodies corporate or other entities, have an interest (such shares are referred to as 
"Affected Shares" in the Articles). Interest in this context is widely defined and includes any interest held through 
ADRs in the shares underlying the relevant ADRs. The directors can require relevant parties to provide them with 
information to enable a determination to be made by the directors as to whether Ordinary Shares are, or are to be 
treated as, Affected Shares. If such information is not available or forthcoming or is unsatisfactory then the directors 
can, at their discretion, determine that Ordinary Shares are to be treated as Affected Shares. Registered holders of 
Ordinary Shares are also obliged to notify the Company if they are aware that any Ordinary Share which they hold 
ought to be treated as an Affected Share for this purpose. With regard to ADRs, the directors can treat all of the 
relevant underlying shares as Affected Shares unless satisfactory evidence as to why they should not be so treated 
is forthcoming.
 In the event that, inter alia, (i) the refusal, withholding, suspension or revocation of any License or the imposition of 
any condition which materially inhibits the exercise of any License (an "Intervening Act") has taken place, (ii) the 
Company receives a notice or direction from any governmental body or any other body which regulates the 
provision of air transport services to the effect that an Intervening Act is imminent, threatened or intended or (iii) an 
Intervening Act may occur as a consequence of the level of non-EU ownership of Ordinary Shares or an Intervening 
Act is imminent, threatened or intended because of the manner of share ownership or control of Ryanair Holdings 
generally, the directors can take action pursuant to the Articles to deal with the situation. They can, inter alia, (i) 
remove any directors or change the chairman of the Board of Directors, (ii) identify those Ordinary Shares, ADRs or 
Affected Shares which give rise to the need to take action and treat such Ordinary Shares, ADRs, or Affected 
Shares as Restricted Shares (see below) or (iii) set a "Permitted Maximum" on the number of Affected Shares 
which may subsist at any time (which may not, save in the circumstances referred to below, be lower than 40% of 
the total number of issued shares) and treat any Affected Shares (or ADRs representing such Affected Shares) in 
excess of this Permitted Maximum as Restricted Shares (see below).
 In addition to the above, if as a consequence of a change of law or a direction, notice or requirement of any state, 
authority or person it is necessary to reduce the total number of Affected Shares below 40% or reduce the number 
of Affected Shares held by any particular stockholder or stockholders in order to overcome, prevent or avoid an 
Intervening Act, the directors may resolve to (i) set the Permitted Maximum at such level below 40% as they 
consider necessary in order to overcome, prevent or avoid such Intervening Act, or (ii) treat such number of 
Affected Shares (or ADRs representing Affected Shares) held by any particular stockholder or stockholders as they 
consider necessary (which could include all of such Affected Shares or ADRs) as Restricted Shares (see below). 
The directors may serve a Restricted Share Notice in respect of any Affected Share, or any ADR representing any 
ADS, which is to be treated as a Restricted Share. Such notices can have the effect of depriving the recipients of 
the rights to attend, vote at and speak at general meetings, which they would otherwise have as a consequence of 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -55-
holding such Ordinary Shares or ADRs. Such notices can also require the recipients to dispose of the Ordinary 
Shares or ADRs concerned to an EU national (so that the relevant shares (or shares underlying the relevant ADRs) 
will then cease to be Affected Shares) within 21 days or such longer period as the directors may determine. The 
directors are also given the power to transfer such Restricted Shares, themselves, in cases of non-compliance with 
the Restricted Share Notice.
 To enable the directors to identify Affected Shares, transferees of Ordinary Shares are generally required to 
provide a declaration as to the nationality of persons having interests in those shares. Stockholders are also obliged 
to notify Ryanair Holdings if they are aware that any shares, which they hold, ought to be treated as Affected 
Shares for this purpose. Purchasers or transferees of ADRs need not complete a nationality declaration because 
the directors expect to treat all of the Ordinary Shares held by the Depositary as Affected Shares. ADS holders 
must open ADR accounts directly with the Depositary if they wish to provide to Ryanair Holdings nationality 
declarations or such other evidence as the directors may require in order to establish to the directors' satisfaction 
that the Ordinary Shares underlying such holder's ADRs are not Affected Shares.

(a)     Additional information in relation to the above interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts 
(i.e. notional value and weighted average interest rates) can be found in Note 11 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
 (b)     EUR31.0 million interest rate swap financial liabilities falling due within one year, includes 
EUR8.5 million derivative financial liabilities, falling due within one year, in respect of cross currency 
interest rate swaps (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).
 (c)     EUR17.1 million commodity forward contracts relate solely to jet fuel derivative financial assets 
(see Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements).
 Interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert a portion of the Company's floating rate exposures on 
borrowings and operating leases into fixed rate exposures and are set so as to match exactly the critical 
terms of the underlying debt or lease being hedged (i.e. notional principal, interest rate settings, re-
pricing dates). These are all designated in cash-flow hedges of the forecasted variable interest payments 
and rentals due on the Company's underlying debt and operating leases and have been determined to be 
highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows. Accordingly, no ineffectiveness has been recorded in 
the income statement relating to these hedges in the current and preceding years.
 The Company also utilises cross currency interest rate swaps to manage exposures to fluctuations in 
foreign exchange rates of U.S. dollar denominated floating rate borrowings, together with managing the 
exposures to fluctuations in interest rates on these U.S. dollar denominated floating rate borrowings. 
Cross currency interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert a portion of the Company's U.S. dollar 
denominated debt to euro and floating rate interest exposures into fixed rate exposures and are set so as 
to match exactly the critical terms of the underlying debt being hedged (i.e. notional principal, interest 
rate settings, re-pricing dates). These are all designated in cash-flow hedges of the forecasted U.S. 
dollar variable interest payments on the Company's underlying debt and have been determined to be highly 
effective in achieving offsetting cash flows. Accordingly, no ineffectiveness has been recorded in the 
income statement relating to these hedges in the current year.

Body
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to Michael O'Leary, CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). When making 
resource allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than results on individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated adjusted profit/(loss) after 
tax of the Company for the year. This measure excludes the effects of certain income and expense items, 
which are unusual, by virtue of their size and incidence, in the context of the Company's ongoing core 
operations, such as the impairment of a financial asset investment, accelerated depreciation related to 
aircraft disposals and one off release of ticket sale revenue.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and, as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, inter-segment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset class comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly 
employed across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable 
segment operations.   In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets 
and liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
 There have been no changes to the basis of segmentation or the measurement basis for the segment profit 
or loss since the prior year.
 Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

21           Pensions
 The Company accounts for pensions in accordance with IAS 19, "Employee Benefits." The Company applied IAS 
19 (amendment 2011), "Employee benefits" with effect from April 1, 2013. The Company has not restated 
previously recognised amounts for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 due to this change in accounting 
policy. The Company has determined that any restatement of prior period amounts would not result in a 
material change in the previous recognised amounts.
 The Company operates defined-benefit and defined-contribution schemes.
 The Company funds the pension entitlements of certain employees through defined-benefit plans. At
 March 31, 2014 there was one plan operated for eligible UK employees.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -88-
 The Irish defined benefit plan was closed effective December 31, 2013. In the year ended March 31, 2014, 
the Company made a final contribution of EUR12.5 million into the Irish defined benefit plan which 
represented a full and final settlement of the Company's liability to contribute to the Irish defined 
benefit plan.
 The UK and Irish schemes were closed to new entrants on January 1, 2000.  In general, on retirement, a 
member is entitled to a pension calculated at 1/60th of the final pensionable salary for each year of 
pensionable service, subject to a maximum of 40 years. The UK plan is fully funded on a discontinuance 
basis and the related pension costs and liabilities are assessed in accordance with the advice of a 
professionally qualified actuary. The investments of the UK plan at March 31, 2014 consisted of units held 
in independently administered funds. The most recent full actuarial valuations of the UK plan was carried 
out at January 1, 2011, in accordance with local regulatory requirements using the projected unit credit 
method, and the valuation reports are not available for public inspection.
 A separate annual actuarial valuation has been performed for the purposes of preparing these financial 
statements. The principal actuarial assumptions used for the purpose of this actuarial valuation were as 
follows:

The Company uses certain mortality rate assumptions when calculating scheme liabilities. The mortality 
assumptions of the UK scheme have been based on the "SAPS" mortality table while the mortality assumptions of 
the Irish scheme for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 have been based on the mortality table 62%/70% 
PNM/FL00. Both mortality assumptions make allowance for future improvements in mortality rates. Retirement ages 
for scheme members are 60 for pilots and 65 for other staff.
 The current life expectancies underlying the value of the scheme liabilities for the UK scheme are as follows:

Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -90-
(i)   Amounts for the year ended March 31, 2014 relate to the UK plan only.
 (ii)  Amounts for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 relate to both the Irish and UK plans combined.
 The plans' assets do not include any of our own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or 
other assets used by us.
 The expected long-term rate of return on assets of 7.14% (2013: 6.52%; 2012: 6.55%) for the UK scheme was 
calculated based on the assumptions of the following returns for each asset class: Equities 8.30% (2013: 
7.50%; 2012: 7.50%); Corporate and Overseas Bonds 4.30% (2013: 4.40%; 2012: 4.65%); and Other 3.65% (2013: 
2.85%; 2012: 3.00%).
 Since there are no suitable euro-denominated AA-rated corporate bonds, the expected return is estimated 
by adding a suitable risk premium to the rate available from government bonds. The assumptions are based 
on long-term expectations at the beginning of the reporting period and are expected to be relatively 
stable.
 The history of the plans for the current and prior periods is as follows:

The Company expects to contribute approximately EUR0.2 million to our defined-benefit plan in 2014.
 Defined-contribution schemes
 The Company operates defined-contribution retirement plans in Ireland and the UK. The costs of these 
plans are charged to the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred. The 
pension cost of these defined-contribution plans was EUR2.6 million in 2014 (2013: EUR2.1 million; 2012: 
EUR1.9 million).

 Ryanair has obtained permission to appeal the decision of the CAT to the UK Court of Appeal and this appeal is 
likely to be heard before the end of 2014.
 Fleet update
 Discussions with Airbus regarding Aer Lingus' A350-XWB long haul fleet order have substantially concluded with 
just some final matters relating to manufacturer communicated delivery delays to be agreed. Aer Lingus notes 
Airbus's recently announced intention to produce the A330neo long haul aircraft. Aer Lingus will study this aircraft's 
capabilities and its potential suitability for the Group's long haul requirements and future plans.
 Q2 2014 financial review
 Aer Lingus delivered a strong performance in Q2 2014, reporting an operating profit, before net exceptional items, 
of EUR38.7 million, which represents a 32.9% improvement on prior year  (Q2 2013: EUR29.1 million) driven by a 
11.1% (or EUR36.5 million) increase in passenger fare revenue supported by robust short haul performance and 
successful deployment of additional transatlantic capacity. Approximately EUR8 million of the increase in passenger 
fare revenue reflects the timing of Easter which occurred in Q2 2013 compared to Q1 in 2013.

 Short haul fare revenue                           226.4     222.4             1.8%

 ----------------------------------------------  --------  --------  ---------------
Passenger fare revenue in Q2 2014 increased by 11.1% on prior year driven by a 4.4% increase in passenger 
numbers and a 6.5% increase in fare revenue per passenger. Performance was supported by a relatively 
stronger April in comparative terms (even considering the timing of Easter) and the successful launch of 
new San Francisco and Toronto routes. These positive improvements were offset by the impact of the 
industrial action in May and June 2014 which resulted in flight re-bookings and other re-scheduling costs.
 Operating costs in Q2 2014 rose 8.1% to EUR399.1 million (Q2: 2013: EUR369.1 million). This increase was 
mainly related to higher activity in the quarter relative to prior year and is reflected in increased 
Aer Lingus Group PLC Half Yearly Report -5-
fuel, aircraft hire, additional staff and higher airport charges. The volume related increase in fuel 
costs was partly offset by a favourable FX movement with the average US$ to EUR FX of 1.37 in Q2 2014 
compared with 1.29 in Q2 2013. The average fuel cost per metric tonne for Q2 2014 (excluding into-plane 
fees) decreased by 2.8% to US$978 (Q2 2013: US$1,006).
 H1 2014 financial review
 (Note: all KPIs and statistics presented below relate to Aer Lingus mainline only and do not include Aer 
Lingus Regional operations or contract flying activities)
 The Group reported an operating loss, before net exceptional items, of EUR9.9 million for the first half 
of 2014 representing a 39.6% improvement year-on year (2013: loss of EUR16.4 million).
 Irish economic context
 While challenges remain, the Irish macroeconomic environment is showing some signs of improvement:
 --     Irish GDP increased by 2.7%, in volume terms, in Q1 2014 compared with Q4 2013 (source: CSO).
 --     Dublin Airport, Aer Lingus' main hub and the largest airport on the island of Ireland, experienced 
several successive months of increased passenger volume growth in 2014 and Dublin Airport passenger 
volumes are up 7% in the six months to June 2014 compared to same period in 2013 (source: 
www.dublinairport.com).

Short haul capacity fell by a net 0.7 percentage points reflecting planned adjustments to the deployment of capacity 
to enable Aer Lingus to protect margins in the context of competitive dynamics in some short haul markets as well 
as intentional cancellations on 20 May related to cabin crew strike action on that date. Capacity reductions were 
partially offset by new summer routes from Dublin to Pula and Hanover and Shannon to Malaga.
 In the circumstances, the Group is pleased with Aer Lingus' short haul performance in H1 2014 and the continuing 
ability of this business to respond to challenges in its market environment. Short haul yield per seat increased by 
0.6% compared to H1 2013; passenger volumes were down by only 0.7% and short haul revenues were down by 
only 1.8%. Management believe that these results represent a creditable performance against the background of 
three sets of actual or threatened strike action and ongoing intense price competition.
 The Aer Lingus regional franchise, operated by Stobart Air, continued to perform strongly in the first six months of 
2014 with a 25.8% increase in the number of passengers using the franchise service. While some of this increase 
reflects former Aer Lingus mainline routes now operated by the franchise, the number of passengers travelling on 
short haul flights with an Aer Lingus code has increased significantly in H1 2014 compared to prior year.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Half Yearly Report -5-
 In September 2013, management commented on more intense than usual competition in Aer Lingus' key mainline 
short haul markets. At the time, management noticed a change in the short haul yield environment with heavily 
discounted fares evident across the European market. While competition has remained robust over the intervening 
period, the short haul pricing environment has more recently normalised although keen pricing remains evident on 
the sun routes in particular.
 Industrial action in H1 2014 had a greater proportionate effect on short haul performance than other parts of Aer 
Lingus' business. Notwithstanding this, Aer Lingus has achieved a significant revenue recovery since the strike 
threatened for 16 and 18 June 2014 was deferred. This recovery has varied across Aer Lingus' short haul network. 
Time sensitive routes have recovered relatively quickly driven by the quality of the Group's schedule and route 
network (i.e. central airports with flight times optimised for frequent and daily travel) and the continuing positive 
effects of Aer Lingus intra-network transfer traffic. Here the Group has seen increasing volumes of European short 
haul passengers transferring onto Aer Lingus long haul services enhanced by the extended range of destinations 
offered by interline and codeshare partners. The challenge of re-building volumes on leisure routes has been 
greater with, as noted above, the higher level of price competition remaining a factor on those routes as well as 
lingering customer confidence issues following the disruptive effects of the cabin crew strike action.
 Aer Lingus' main competitor and Europe's lowest unit cost operator, Ryanair, is seeking to re-orient its passenger 
proposition and market positioning. It remains too early to assess what effect Ryanair's efforts will have on Aer 
Lingus' short haul business. However, Aer Lingus has maintained its share of Irish airport traffic in the first half of 
2014:
Market share                    H1 2014   H1 2013   H1 2012

 ------------------------------  --------  --------  --------
Several of the features which Ryanair is introducing have been part of the Aer Lingus "value carrier" proposition for 
several years and in that respect, Ryanair is seeking to copy selected elements of Aer Lingus' successful service 
offering. With this in mind, Aer Lingus is continuing to enhance and evolve its passenger experience (see earlier 
comments related to the CORE programme) so that Aer Lingus can continue to successfully differentiate itself from 
its competitors, while also working to improve its cost competitiveness.

Interest rate re-pricing
 Floating interest rates on financial liabilities are generally referenced to European inter-bank interest rates 
(EURIBOR). Secured long-term debt and interest rate swaps typically re-price on a quarterly basis with finance 
leases re-pricing on a semi-annual basis. We use current interest rate settings on existing floating rate debt at each 
year-end to calculate contractual cash flows.
 Fixed interest rates on financial liabilities are fixed for the duration of the underlying structures (typically between 
10 and 12 years).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -80-

Interest rates on cash and liquid resources are generally based on the appropriate EURIBOR, LIBOR or bank 
rates dependant on the principal amounts on deposit.
 (d)           Foreign currency risk
 The Company has exposure to various foreign currencies (principally U.K. pounds sterling and U.S. 
dollars) due to the international nature of its operations. The Company manages this risk by matching U.K. 
pound sterling revenues against U.K. pound sterling costs. Any remaining unmatched U.K. pound sterling 
revenues are used to fund U.S. dollar currency exposures that arise in relation to fuel, maintenance, 
aviation insurance and capital expenditure costs or are sold for euro. The Company also sells euro forward 
to cover certain U.S. dollar costs. Further details of the hedging activity carried out by the Company are 
disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
 The following table shows the net amount of monetary assets of the Company that are not denominated in 
euro at March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. Such amounts have been translated using the following year-end 
foreign currency rates in 2014: EUR/GBP: 0.8282; EUR/$: 1.3788 (2013: EUR/GBP: 0.8456; EUR/$: 1.2805; 
2012: EUR/GBP: 0.8339; EUR/$: 1.3356).

 Foreign currency forward contracts may be utilised in a number of ways: forecast U.K.  pounds sterling and euro 
revenue receipts are converted into U.S. dollars to hedge against forecasted U.S. dollar payments principally for jet 
fuel, insurance, capital expenditure and other aircraft related costs. These are designated in cash-flow hedges of 
forecasted U.S. dollar payments and have been determined to be highly effective in offsetting variability in future 
cash flows arising from the fluctuation in the U.S. dollar to U.K. pounds sterling and euro exchange rates for the 
forecasted U.S. dollar purchases. Because the timing of anticipated payments and the settlement of the related 
derivatives is very closely coordinated, no ineffectiveness has been recorded for these foreign currency forward 
contracts in the current or preceding years (the underlying hedged items and hedging instruments have been 
consistently closely matched).
 The Company also utilises jet fuel forward contracts to manage exposure to jet fuel prices. These are used to 
hedge the Company's forecasted fuel purchases, and are arranged so as to match as closely as possible against 
forecasted fuel delivery and payment requirements. These are designated in cash-flow hedges of forecasted fuel 
payments and have been determined to be highly effective in offsetting variability in future cash flows arising from 
fluctuations in jet fuel prices. No ineffectiveness has been recorded on these arrangements in the current or 
preceding years.
 The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) began operating for airlines on January 1,  2012. In 
order to manage the risks associated with the fluctuation in the price of carbon emission credits, the Company 
entered into swap arrangements to fix the cost of a portion of its forecasted carbon emission credit purchases. The 
Company can forecast its requirement for carbon credits as they are directly linked to its consumption of jet fuel. 
These instruments have been designated in cash-flow hedges and no ineffectiveness has been recorded in the 
current year.
 The (gains)/losses on the aircraft firm commitments are recognised as part of the capitalised cost of aircraft 
additions, within property, plant and equipment. The (gains)/losses on interest rate swaps, commodity forward 
contracts and forward currency contracts (excluding aircraft firm commitments) are recognised in the income 
statement when the hedged transaction occurs.

(e)           Equity risk
 The Company has exposure to equity price risk primarily in relation to its 29.8% investment in Aer 
Lingus. The Company does not have significant influence over Aer Lingus and accordingly, this investment 
is classified as an available-for-sale financial asset rather than an investment in an associate. 
Additional information in relation to the available-for-sale financial asset can be found in Note 4 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
 (f)            Credit risk
 The Company holds significant cash balances, which are invested on a short-term basis and are classified 
as either cash equivalents or liquid investments. These deposits and other financial instruments 
(principally certain derivatives and loans as identified above) give rise to credit risk on amounts due 
from counterparties. Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to 
any one counterparty through regular review of counterparties' market-based ratings, Tier 1 capital level 
and credit default swap rates and by taking into account bank counterparties' systemic importance to the 
financial systems of their home countries. The Company typically enters into deposits and derivative 
contracts with parties that have a long term Standard and Poors "A" category rating or equivalent credit 
rating. The maximum exposure arising in the event of default on the part of the counterparty is the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -81-
carrying value of the relevant financial instrument. The Company is authorised to place funds on deposit 
for periods up to 18 months. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital as well as the level of 
dividends to ordinary shareholders on an ongoing basis.
 The Company's revenues derive principally from airline travel on scheduled services, internet income and 
in-flight and related sales. Revenue is primarily derived from European routes. No individual customer 
accounts for a significant portion of total revenue.
 At March 31, 2014, EUR1.4 million (2013: EUR1.1 million; 2012: EUR1.0 million) of our total accounts 
receivable balance were past due, of which EUR0.1 million (2013: EUR0.1 million; 2012: EUR0.1 million) was 
impaired and provided for and EUR1.3 million (2013: EUR1.0 million; 2012: EUR0.9 million) was past due but 
not impaired. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
 (g)           Liquidity and capital management
 The Company's cash and liquid resources comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and 
restricted cash. The Company defines the capital that it manages as the Company's long-term debt and 
equity. The Company's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and 
market confidence and to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen 
events.
 The Company finances its working capital requirements through a combination of cash generated from 
operations, bank loans and debt capital market issuances for the acquisition of aircraft. The Company had 
cash and liquid resources at March 31, 2014 of EUR3,241.7 million (2013: EUR3,559.0 million; 2012: 
EUR3,515.6 million). During the year, the Company funded EUR505.8 million in purchases of property, plant 
and equipment (2013: EUR310.7 million; 2012: EUR317.6 million). Cash generated from operations has been 
the principal source for these cash requirements, supplemented primarily by aircraft-related financing 
structures.
 The Board of Directors periodically reviews the capital structure of the Company, considering the cost of 
capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Board approves any material adjustments 
to the capital structure in terms of the relative proportions of debt and equity.
 Ryanair has generally been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet its non-aircraft 
acquisition-related working capital requirements. Management believes that the working capital available 
to the Company is sufficient for its present requirements and will be sufficient to meet its anticipated 
requirements for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the 2014 fiscal year.
 (h)           Guarantees
 Details of the Company's guarantees and the related accounting have been disclosed in Note 23 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
 (i)            Sensitivity analysis
 (i)            Interest rate risk: Based on the levels of and composition of year-end interest bearing 
assets and liabilities, including derivatives, at March 31, 2014, a plus or minus one-percentage-point 
movement in interest rates would result in a respective increase or decrease of EUR18.0 million (net of 
tax) in net interest income and expense in the income statement (2013: EUR18.3 million; 2012: EUR18.3 
million) and EUR16.7 million in equity (2013: EUR28.8 million: 2012: EUR36.9 million). All of the Group's 
interest rate swaps are used to swap variable rate debt to fixed rate debt; consequently any changes in 
interest rates would have an equal and opposite income statement effect for both the interest rate swaps 
and the debt.
 (ii)           Foreign currency risk: A plus or minus change of 10% in relevant foreign currency exchange 
rates, based on outstanding foreign currency-denominated financial assets and financial liabilities at 
March 31, 2014 would have a respective positive or negative impact on the income statement of EUR3.0 
million (net of tax) (2013: EUR2.6 million; 2012: EUR1.8  million) and on equity of EUR288.2 million (net 
of tax) (2013: EUR183.1 million; 2012: EUR176.3 million).
 (iii)          Equity price risk: An increase/decrease of 10% in the Aer Lingus share price as of March 
31, 2014 would result in an increase/decrease of EUR26.0 million in the fair value of the available-for-
sale financial assets (2013:EUR22.1 million; 2012: EUR15.0 million). The increase/decrease would be 
recognised in other comprehensive income.

Body
 The fair value of interest rate swaps is computed by discounting the projected cash flows on the Company's swap 
arrangements to present value using an appropriate market rate of interest. The fair value of forward foreign 
exchange contracts and commodity contracts is determined based on the present value of the quoted forward price. 
Recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
 Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised 
asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative 
financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income (in the cash flow hedging reserve on the balance 
sheet). When the hedged forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the 
cumulative gain or loss is removed from other comprehensive income and included in the initial measurement of 
that asset or liability. Otherwise the cumulative gain or loss is removed from other comprehensive income and 
recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction. The ineffective part of any hedging 
transaction and the gain or loss thereon is recognised in the income statement immediately.
 When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the underlying hedged transaction is still 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in other comprehensive income and is 
recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is 
recognised in the income statement immediately.
 Where a derivative financial instrument hedges the changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an 
unrecognised firm commitment, any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement. 
The hedged item is also stated at fair value in respect of the risk being hedged, with any gain or loss also being 
recognised in the income statement.
 Inventories
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on invoiced price on an average 
basis for all stock categories. Net realisable value is calculated as the estimated selling price arising in the ordinary 
course of business, net of estimated selling costs.
 Trade and other receivables and payables
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -68-
 Trade and other receivables and payables are stated on initial recognition at fair value plus any incremental direct 
costs and subsequently at amortised cost, net (in the case of receivables) of any impairment losses, which 
approximates fair value given the short-dated nature of these assets and liabilities.
 Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash represents cash held at banks and available on demand, and is categorised for measurement purposes as 
"loans and receivables."
 Cash equivalents are current asset investments (other than cash) that are readily convertible into known amounts 
of cash, typically cash deposits of more than one day but less than three months at the date of purchase. Deposits 
with maturities greater than three months are recognised as short-term investments, are categorised as loans and 
receivables and are carried initially at fair value and then subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective-
interest method.
 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
 All loans and borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-current interest-bearing loans are measured at 
amortised cost, using the effective interest yield methodology.
 Leases
 Leases under which the Company assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet, at an amount equal to the 
lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments, and are depreciated over their 
estimated useful lives. The present values of the future lease payments are recorded as obligations under finance 
leases and the interest element of a lease obligation is charged to the income statement over the period of the 
lease in proportion to the balances outstanding.
 Other leases are operating leases and the associated leased assets are not recognised on the Company's balance 
sheet. Expenditure arising under operating leases is charged to the income statement as incurred. The Company 
also enters into sale-and-leaseback transactions whereby it sells the rights to an aircraft to an external party and 
subsequently leases the aircraft back, by way of an operating lease. Any profit or loss on the disposal where the 
price achieved is not considered to be at fair value is spread over the period during which the asset is expected to 
be used. The profit or loss amount deferred is included within "other creditors" and divided into components of 
greater than and less than one year.
 Provisions and contingencies
 A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation. If the 
effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future outflow at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
 The Company assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to contingencies, including legal matters, as well 
as probable losses. We record provisions for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred 
and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of 
the obligation will only be confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured 
with reasonable reliability. Provisions are re-measured at each balance sheet date based on the best estimate of 
the settlement amount.
 In relation to legal matters, we develop estimates in consultation with internal and external legal counsel taking into 
account the relevant facts and circumstances known to us. The factors that we consider in developing our legal 
provisions include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and number of other similar current and 
past litigation cases, the nature of the subject matter of the litigation, the likelihood of settlement and current state of 
settlement discussions, if any.
 Segment reporting
 Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal organisational and management 
structure and the internal reporting information provided to the chief operating decision maker, who is responsible 
for allocating resources and assessing performance of operating segments. The Company is managed as a single 
business unit that provides low fares airline-related services, including scheduled services, and ancillary services 
including car hire services, and internet and other related services to third parties, across a European route 
network.
 Income statement classification and presentation
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -68-
 Individual income statement captions have been presented on the face of the income statement, together with 
additional line items, headings and sub-totals, where it is determined that such presentation is relevant to an 
understanding of our financial performance, in accordance with IAS 1, "Presentation of Financial Statements".
 Expenses are classified and presented in accordance with the nature-of-expenses method. We disclose separately 
on the face of the income statement, within other income and expense, losses on the impairment of available-for-
sale financial assets and gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment. The nature of the 
Company's available-for-sale asset is that of a financial investment; accordingly any impairment of the investment is 
categorised as finance expense and included in other income/(expense) as a separate line item. The presentation 
of gains or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment within other income/(expense) accords with 
industry practice.
 Revenues
 Scheduled revenues comprise the invoiced value of airline and other services, net of government taxes. Revenue 
from the sale of flight seats is recognised in the period in which the service is provided. Unearned revenue 
represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and a provision for government tax refund claims attributable to 
unused tickets, and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Revenue, net of government taxes, is 
released to the income statement as passengers fly. Unused tickets are recognised as revenue on a systematic 
basis, such that twelve months of time expired revenues are recognised in revenue in each fiscal year. 
Miscellaneous fees charged for any changes to flight tickets are recognised in revenue immediately.
 During the year ended March 31, 2012, changes in estimates relating to the timing of revenue recognition for 
unused passenger tickets were made, resulting in increased revenue of EUR65.3 million (fiscal year 2014:Nil, 
2013:Nil). This change reflects more accurate and timely data obtained through system enhancements.
 Ancillary revenues are recognised in the income statement in the period the ancillary services are provided.

 In the case of an individual non-resident stockholder resident in an EU member state or tax treaty country, the 
declaration must be accompanied by a current certificate of tax residence from the tax authorities in the 
stockholder's country of residence. In the case of both an individual and corporate non-resident stockholder 
resident in an EU member state or tax treaty country the declaration also must contain an undertaking by the 
individual or corporate non-resident stockholder that he, she or it will advise the Company accordingly if he, she or it 
ceases to meet the conditions to be entitled to the DWT exemption. No declaration is required if the stockholder is a 
5% parent company in another EU member state in accordance with section 831 TCA 1997. Neither is a declaration 
required on the payment by a company resident in Ireland to another company so resident if the company making 
the dividend is a 51% subsidiary of that other company.
 American Depositary Receipts. Special arrangements with regard to the dividend withholding tax obligation apply in 
the case of Irish companies using ADRs through U.S. depositary banks that have been authorized by the Irish 
Revenue. Such banks, which receive dividends from the company and pass them on to the U.S. ADS holders 
beneficially entitled to such dividends, will be allowed to receive and pass on the gross dividends (i.e., before 
withholding) based on an "address system" where the recorded addresses of such holder, as listed in the 
depositary bank's register of depositary receipts, is in the United States.
 Taxation on Dividends. Companies resident in Ireland other than those taxable on receipt of dividends as trading 
income are exempt from corporation tax on distributions received on Ordinary Shares from other Irish resident 
companies. Stockholders that are "close" companies for Irish taxation purposes may, however, be subject to a 20% 
corporation tax surcharge on undistributed investment income.
 Individual stockholders who are resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland are subject to income tax on the gross 
dividend at their marginal tax rate, but are entitled to a credit for the tax withheld by the company paying the 
dividend. The dividend will also be subject to the universal social charge. An individual stockholder who is not liable 
or not fully liable for income tax by reason of exemption or otherwise may be entitled to receive an appropriate 
refund of tax withheld. A charge to Irish social security taxes can also arise for such individuals on the amount of 
any dividend received from the Company.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -57-
 Except in certain circumstances, a person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and is entitled to 
receive dividends without deductions is not liable for Irish tax on the dividends. Where a person who is neither 
resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland is subject to withholding tax on the dividend received due to not benefiting 
from any exemption from such withholding, the amount of that withholding will generally satisfy such person's 
liability for Irish tax.
 Capital Gains Tax. A person who is either resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland will generally be liable for Irish 
capital gains tax on any gain realized on the disposal of the Ordinary Shares or ADSs. The current capital gains tax 
rate is 33%. A person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and who does not carry on a trade in 
Ireland through a branch or agency will not be subject to Irish capital gains tax on the disposal of the Ordinary 
Shares or ADSs.
 Irish Capital Acquisitions Tax. A gift or inheritance of the Ordinary Shares or ADSs will be within the charge to Irish 
Capital Acquisitions Tax ("CAT") notwithstanding that the donor or the donee/successor in relation to such gift or 
inheritance is resident outside Ireland. CAT is charged at a rate of 33% above a tax-free threshold. This tax-free 
threshold is determined by the amount of the current benefit and of previous benefits taken since December 5, 
1991, as relevant, within the charge to CAT and the relationship between the donor and the successor or donee. 
Gifts and inheritances between spouses (and in certain cases former spouses) are not subject to CAT.
 In a case where an inheritance or gift of the Ordinary Shares or ADSs is subject to both Irish CAT and foreign tax 
of a similar character, the foreign tax paid may in certain circumstances be credited in whole or in part against the 
Irish tax.
 Irish Stamp Duty. It is assumed for the purposes of this paragraph that ADSs are dealt in on a recognized stock 
exchange in the United States (NASDAQ is a recognized stock exchange in the United States for this purpose). 
Under current Irish law, no stamp duty will be payable on the acquisition of ADSs by persons purchasing such 
ADSs or on any subsequent transfer of ADSs. A transfer of Ordinary Shares (including transfers effected through 
Euroclear U.K. & Ireland Limited) wherever executed and whether on sale, in contemplation of a sale or by way of a 
gift, will be subject to duty at the rate of 1% of the consideration given or, in the case of a gift or if the purchase 
price is inadequate or unascertainable, on the market value of the Ordinary Shares. Transfers of Ordinary Shares 
that are not liable for duty at the rate of 1% (e.g., transfers under which there is no change in beneficial ownership) 
may be subject to a fixed duty of EUR12.50.
 The Irish Revenue treats a conversion of Ordinary Shares to ADSs made in contemplation of a sale or a change in 
beneficial ownership (under Irish law) as an event subject to stamp duty at a rate of 1%. The Irish Revenue has 
indicated that a re-conversion of ADSs to Ordinary Shares made in contemplation of a sale or a change in 
beneficial ownership (under Irish law) will not be subject to a stamp duty. However, the subsequent sale of the re-
converted Ordinary Shares will give rise to Irish stamp duty at the 1% rate. If the transfer of the Ordinary Shares is a 
transfer under which there is no change in the beneficial ownership (under Irish law) of the Ordinary Shares being 
transferred, nominal stamp duty only will be payable on the transfer. Under Irish law, it is not clear whether the mere 
deposit of Ordinary Shares for ADSs or ADSs for Ordinary Shares would be deemed to constitute a change in 
beneficial ownership. Accordingly, it is possible that holders would be subject to stamp duty at the 1% rate when 
merely depositing Ordinary Shares for ADSs or ADSs for Ordinary Shares and, consequently, the Depositary 
reserves the right in such circumstances to require payment of stamp duty at the rate of 1% from the holders.
 The person accountable for payment of stamp duty is the transferee or, in the case of a transfer by way of a gift or 
for a consideration less than the market value, all parties to the transfer. Stamp duty is normally payable within 30 
days after the date of execution of the transfer. Late or inadequate payment of stamp duty will result in liability for 
interest, penalties and fines.
 United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
 Except as described below under the heading "Non-U.S. Holders," the following is a summary of certain U.S. 
federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs 
by a holder that is a citizen or resident of the United States, a U.S. domestic corporation or otherwise subject to 
U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis in respect of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs ("U.S. Holders"). This 
summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to 
a decision to purchase the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs. In particular, the summary deals only with U.S. Holders 
that will hold Ordinary Shares or ADRs as capital assets and generally does not address the tax treatment of U.S. 
Holders that may be subject to special tax rules such as banks, insurance companies, dealers in securities or 
currencies, partnerships or partners therein, entities subject to the branch profits tax, traders in securities electing to 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -57-
mark to market, persons that own 10% or more of the stock of the Company, U.S. Holders whose "functional 
currency" is not U.S. dollars or persons that hold the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs as part of an integrated 
investment (including a "straddle") consisting of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs and one or more other positions.
 Holders of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. or other tax 
consequences of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs in light of their 
particular circumstances, including, in particular, the effect of any foreign, state or local tax laws.
 For U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders of the ADRs will be treated as the owners of the Ordinary Shares 
represented by those ADRs.
 Taxation of Dividends
 Dividends, if any, paid with respect to the Ordinary Shares, including Ordinary Shares represented by ADRs, will 
be included in the gross income of a U.S. Holder when the dividends are received by the holder or the Depositary. 
Such dividends generally should not be eligible for the "dividends received" deduction allowed to U.S. corporations 
in respect of dividends from a domestic corporation. Dividends paid in euro will be includible in the income of a U.S. 
Holder in a U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the day they are received 
by the holder or the Depositary. U.S. Holders generally should not be required to recognize any foreign currency 
gain or loss to the extent such dividends paid in Euro are converted into U.S. dollars immediately upon receipt.

 The Company's purchase of 246 of the 297 Boeing 737-800 aircraft in the fleet as of March 31, 2014 has been 
funded by bank financing in the form of loans supported by a loan guarantee from Ex-Im Bank (with respect to 210  
aircraft), JOLCOs and commercial debt. With respect to these 246 aircraft, at March 31, 2014, the Company had 
outstanding cumulative borrowings under these facilities of EUR3,083.6 million with a weighted average interest 
rate of 2.49%. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital 
Resources" for additional information on these facilities and the related swaps, including a tabular summary of the 
"Effective Borrowing Profile" illustrating the effect of the swap transactions (each of which is with an established 
international financial counterparty) on the profile of Ryanair's aircraft-related debt at March 31, 2014. At March 31, 
2014, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements relating to this floating rate debt was represented by a loss 
of EUR72.4 million (gross of tax), as compared with a loss of EUR81.9 million at March 31, 2013. See Note 11 to 
the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 for additional information.
 If Ryanair had not entered into such derivative agreements, a plus or minus one percentage point movement in 
interest rates would impact the fair value of this liability by approximately EUR16.7 million. The earnings and cash-
flow impact of any such change in interest rates would have been approximately plus or minus EUR18 million in the 
2014 fiscal year.
 Item 12. Description of Securities Other than Equity Securities
 Holders of ADSs are required to pay certain fees and expenses. The table below sets forth the fees and expenses 
which, under the deposit agreement between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, holders of ADRs 
can be charged or be deducted from dividends or other distributions on the deposited shares. The Company and 
The Bank of New York Mellon have also entered into a separate letter agreement, which has the effect of reducing 
some of the fees listed below.
Persons depositing or withdrawing ADSs must pay:           For:

 DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 The Company has carried out an evaluation, as of March 31, 2014, under the supervision and with the 
participation of the Company's management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial 
officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). There are inherent 
limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the 
possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. 
Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of 
achieving their control objectives. Based upon the Company's evaluation, the chief executive officer and 
chief financial officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2014, the disclosure controls and procedures 
were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports 
the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and

financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over 
financial reporting, (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Company's 
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with IFRS. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and 
procedures that:

the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
 --      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors; and
 --      provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.
 The Company's management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial 
reporting as of March 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in the 1992 Framework in "Internal 
Control - Integrated Framework," issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission ("COSO"). Based on the evaluation, management has concluded that the Company maintained 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2014.
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the 2014 
fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's 
internal control over financial reporting.
